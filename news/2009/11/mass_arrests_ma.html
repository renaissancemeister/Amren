<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racial attacks like the ones behind the arrest of 32 suspects in Denver are part of a trend spreading across the country, gang experts said Saturday.</p>
<p>As part of the trend, black gang members videotape the assaults in trendy tourist districts and sell them on the underground market as entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They knock a young white guy out with one blow to see if his knees will wobble and surround them and take their money,&#8221; said the Rev. Leon Kelly, who runs a Denver gang-prevention program. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denver police announced the 32 arrests Friday after a months-long undercover investigation into what authorities said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in Denver, including in the Lower Downtown entertainment district.</p>
<p>They seek the arrests of three more suspects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denver police Lt. Matt Murray said that the same day Chief Gerry Whitman announced the arrests, a national TV program profiled a similar gang-fueled onslaught in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several months ago, Kelly said, he got a copy of a videotape recorded in West Palm Beach, Fla. Gang members surrounded a white couple at a club. One of them told the others to hold on.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;Let me get this camera on.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a staged thing,&#8221; Kelly said.</p>
<p>The gang members crave the notoriety of having their one-punch knockouts recorded on tape and sold on the black market. They&rsquo;ll rewind the tapes and watch them over and over, he said.</p>
<p>When they watch the videos and see a big punch landed and gang members at the scene start laughing, they&rsquo;ll all break out laughing, said Kelly, who heads the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tapes get taken from town to town. Gang members mimic what they see, Kelly said.</p>
<p>In Denver, groups of four or five black men would approach a victim late at night or early in the morning and taunt a man with racial slurs, Whitman has said. Gang members have broken victims&rsquo; noses and shattered eye sockets, he said.</p>
<p>A task force including Denver cops, FBI agents and prosecutors from District Attorney Mitch Morrissey&rsquo;s office identified 26 incidents since July in which the gangs assaulted or robbed white or Latino men. The offenders took wallets, iPods, cash and other small items.</p>
<p>Most of the suspects admitted they belonged to either the Rollin&rsquo; 60s Crips gang or the Black Gangster Disciples gang.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though robbery is a predominant motivation of the gang members, it is more complicated than that, Kelly said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

						<p>
							<i>Jordan Steffen, Denver Post, November 20, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Denver Police Department announced today that they have made 32 arrests during a sweep to end a four-month spree of what police said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in downtown Denver, including the LoDo entertainment district.</p>
<p>A task force comprised of the Denver Police, FBI and the Denver District Attorney&rsquo;s Office investigated 26 incidents in which groups of black males verbally harassed and then assaulted white or Hispanic males, according to Denver Police Chief Gerry Whitman.</p>
<p>Many of the victims were robbed after being assaulted.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the gang intervention Reverent actually cited whites as intentional victims.  I predict, like the bus beating over in the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis a few months ago, the higher ups will put pressure on him to recant the racial angle.</p>
<p>As for a reason, I think it&rsquo;s arrogance among blacks due to the current occupant at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just surprised there hasn&rsquo;t been more of this sort of thing since President Obamarama was elected, just as New York City was rapidly returning to the jungle during the pre-Giuliani Dinkins administration, with flat-out pogroms in Crown Heights, etc. What will it take for white people to snap out of their Niceness trance and see the slow-motion genocide that&rsquo;s gathering force, that their situation is truly one of fight back, or perish?</p>

		<p>To make this not be a &#8220;joke&#8221; anymore, there need to be new laws enacted and enforced that would give long (20+ years) sentences to anyone involved in such a crime.</p>

		<p>White people are rapidly reaching a boiling point in this country.  Our borders, our culture, our wives and daughters, our safety and our dignity are all under brutal seige and our so-called government is openly siding with these predators.  This is not the country I knew as a child.  Thunder clouds are building, and this depressed economy and national mood, are very likely the calm before a big storm.  </p>

		<p>Remember the Los Angeles riots of 1992 - All of the destruction, the hatred, the murders, the way the LAPD stood back and refused to discharge their duty as the murders raged.I hope people here never forget that orgy of destruction and always bear it in mind when you are lectured to be &#8216;compassionate&rsquo; on the race dilemma.<br>
  - Now, pray, what was the casus belli of that conflagration - Why, a hardened black criminal by the name of Rodney King lead members of the LAPD on a merry dance and was given a &#8216;proper kicking&rsquo; by the same by way of &#8216;thank-you&rsquo;.All this would have been forgotten, ignored as par for the course, but for one thing, a piece of white trash playing with his new video toy happened to chance upon it, and in an effort to make a few bucks for himself sold highly edited footage to local TV stations who proceeded to broadcast it non-stop, daily for months on end until the whole world (literally) had seen the footage.<br>
 One wonders if the &#8216;Denver footage&rsquo; will ever be broadcast nationally &#8216;on the hour every hour&rsquo;, and if indeed so, will it provoke a Rodney King type of reaction amongst Whites?</p>

		<p>Colorado does not have the &#8220;stand your ground laws&#8221; as do the following states:</p>
<p>Alabama <br>
Arizona <br>
Florida <br>
Georgia <br>
Indiana <br>
Kentucky <br>
Louisiana <br>
Oklahoma Title 21§1289.25 <br>
South Carolina (Persons not &#8220;required to needlessly retreat.&#8221;) <br>
Texas <br>
Tennessee 2007 Tenn. Pub. Acts Ch. 210 (Amends Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-11-611) <br>
Utah <br>
Washington (Homicide justifiable in the lawful defense of self or other persons present; and there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished &hellip;or in the actual resistance of an attempt to commit a felony&hellip; or upon or in a dwelling, or other place&hellip;) </p>
<p>There is no duty to retreat nor is the law restricted only to the home.  Most all of them apply to anywhere a person might be, public places included.  If he/she feels they are in danger of serious bodily injury or death, they have the option to shoot to kill their attacker(s).</p>
<p>Colorado has what is termed a &#8220;Castle law,&#8221; which stipulates that a person has no duty to retreat and can use deadly force in his/her home, if they have good reason to believe they might suffer serious bodily injury or death, but that law is restricted to the home.</p>
<p>This incident is a good example of what could happen to someone without the Stand your ground law in public places.  </p>
<p>These attacks by black punks would stop instantly with no necessity for police arrests and prosecution, if Coloradoans weren&rsquo;t so wimpish as to disallow the &#8220;Stand your ground&#8221; law, and shoot the first gang of black thugs that would attempt a beating or murder. </p>
<p>Blacks respect nothing but superior force.  They&rsquo;re too dimwitted to respect anything else.</p>
<p>I doubt we will ever read any similar attacks take place in the two states that have the strongest stand your ground laws, Florida and Texas.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Rollin&rsquo; 60s Crips&#8221;?<br>
Has Denver been so behind the times that their gangs are named after those of South Central LA/Compton of the 1980s (the movie &#8216;Colors&rsquo;, anyone)? These gangster types are all cowards, as denoted by their &#8216;safety in numbers&rsquo; gang fascination. Every single gang banger to ever approach me (I live in Northern California) with malice chickened-out at the last minute in the absence of their &#8216;backup&rsquo;, cowards, all of &#8216;em. </p>

		<p>Since I know EXACTLY what Diversity means, white guys like me aren&rsquo;t likely to be victims of these kinds of attacks. Furthermore, I haven&rsquo;t been castrated, so if some punk of ANY RACE tries that on me, I&rsquo;ll put him in a wheelchair. </p>
<p>Why are those white guys out in such bad neighborhoods to begin with? My guess is they&rsquo;re learning about &#8220;Our Greatest Strength&#8221;.<br>

		<p>And what can we whites do about it? Do we have anyone who will march in the streets yelling &#8220;No justice, no peace&#8221;?</p>
<p>They are not even going to call this a hate crime. We know who they are saving the hate crimes for. The hate crimes will be used to make sure they lock up an equal portion of whites in our prison system. It&rsquo;s part of obama&rsquo;s social justice program.</p>

		<p> When Kelly said gang members enjoy watching &#8220;someone get beaten up like that,&#8221; he was half right. They enjoy seeing WHITE someones getting beaten up like that. This is one of the things our idiotic news media, schools and government trumpeting of the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; malarkey for the last 50-odd years have done. They have made these thugs think they have a RIGHT to beat up White people   &mdash;   that it&rsquo;s a big game.</p>
<p> Maybe just a police sweep and a big bunch of arrests aren&rsquo;t the answer to this problem. Maybe they&rsquo;ll pick on the wrong White guy, or guys, sooner or later, and get a bellyful of lead. The sudden, violent death of your partners in crime often clears the heads of gangbangers wonderfully.</p>

		<p>My wife and I walk downtown (where we live).  I am always armed.  I encourage all whites living in a state allowing concealed carry to obtain a permit, and then learn how to use a pistol.  Shot placement, not caliber, is key.  I&rsquo;m cautious, but whenever we approach a black my hand is in my pant firmly grasping my pocket pistol.  I make it a point to look them straight in the eye as we pass.  I don&rsquo;t think blacks are used to that  &mdash;  most whites will not look a black directly in the eye, but instead lower their heads and cower.  This is a mistake.  The blacks I look dead in the eye can sense I am not to be messed with, and usually stand clear.  On the other hand, if I see a group of blacks we always cross the street. It&rsquo;s no sense being stupid, and blacks tend to be pack attackers.  Also, stay in more populated and lighted areas.  Always keep your eyes moving around.    </p>

		<p>I bet my money that none of the perpetrators is charged with a hate crime, just robbery or assault, even if it was as it appears to be, racially motivated. One must practically twist the arm of the DA to get them to file hate crime charges when it is anything other than white on black/brown/gay &#8216;hate&rsquo; crime.</p>

		<p>A sampling of videos of black-on-white violence is easily had by going to Google Video &#8220;Advanced Search&#8221;:<br>
http://video.google.com/videoadvancedsearch?hl=en</p>
<p>In the &#8220;Exact Phrase&#8221; window, type &#8220;black-on-white&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;With at Least One of These Words&#8221; window, type  &#8220;violence&#8221; &#8220;assaults&#8221; &#8220;attacks&#8221; &#8220;crime&#8221;. </p>
<p>Imagine the extended coverage of almost any of these brutal incidents if the races of the perpetrators and victims were reversed.</p>
<p>That the races ARE so seldom reversed in reality makes every incident following the preferred white-on-minority narrative   &mdash;  - such as appeared was the case in the early weeks of the Duke lacrosse rape hoax   &mdash;  -precious beyond measure to the national media.  </p>
<p>What you are about to see, however, should you follow my suggestion is, of course, not precious, NOT even newsworthy beyond the immediate locale.</p>

		<p>I just wish some white would be armed with a high round capacity gun, and when attacked, start blasting away the way Bernhard Goetz did.If they were to do that, they would be in a lot less legal trouble than he was.The worst thing that could happen legally would be for them to be charged with having the gun, not using it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;it is more complicated than that&#8221; because these are racist hate crimes against whites by blacks.</p>

		<p>This is probably the first time I have ever read a mainstream media outlet talk frankly about the racist motivations behind black-on-white attacks. I imagine the $PLC, Media Matters the ADL and other McCarthyite &#8220;watchdog&#8221; groups will start to monitor the writings of Jordan Steffen and Kirk Mitchell a bit more closely.</p>
<p>A couple of things about these racial attacks:</p>
<p>1. Blacks will always attack in groups. If it is a lone black attack the victim will be a woman, old man or a wimpy man who cannot fight back.</p>
<p>2. Blacks will almost always run from a fair, one-on-one fight with a white man the same size or bigger. I saw this several times in the military and in some local bars. Almost all blacks think they intimidate whites. When a white counters with anger and aggression of his own the black will immediately become frightened and intimidated.</p>
<p>3. Whites who do fight back often end up in trouble. We all know what happened to Bernie Goetz. But during the Cincinnati riots of 2001, the only hate crime charge was brought against a white man who beat up a black man that attacked his car with a brick.</p>
<p>4. Every time a white person fights back it helps lessen these racist attacks. Blacks learn that not all white men are cowardly white liberals from the suburbs who are docile and submissive.</p>
<p>5. I lived in northern England for a while and noticed that young whites hang out in packs (just like blacks in the U.S.). But in the U.S., whites often hang out alone or with thier girlfriend or maybe one other male friend. If young whites hung out in packs like the blacks, they would not be such easy targets for black gangs of 12 or 14 males.</p>
<p>6. It may not be P.C. but I wish white gangs would turn the tables and start taping one-punch knockouts of blacks (particularly if they can locate the ones who carry out these attacks.) Of course, they would be arrested for hate crimes and become global poster boys for Amerikan racism. But it would certainly even the score and stop a lot of these attacks on our women, children and senior citizens.</p>

		<p>The Usual Suspects can be counted on to blame these attacks on nonsense like the &#8220;lack of jobs&#8221; for these thugs, all while ignoring the fact that this vicious behavior drives business away from largely-black areas, virtually guaranteeing that employment opportunities will be scarce.</p>
<p>The only good thing about their videotaping these attacks is that the footage is instantly evidence for prosecutors.</p>

		<p>I ***STILL*** dont see the words &#8220;hate crime&#8221; printed in these articles. Or are the police trying to say that these &#8220;racially motivated assaults&#8221; AGAIN, dont qualify as hate crimes??</p>

		<p>Month long investigation? If this was a gang of whites doing this to blacks, Im sure they would have been all over it in record time. Plus Im thinking also that the only reason they are calling this racial is that the blacks were probably mugging (rolling) a certain minority that usually hangs in certain trendy districts of large cities. If it were just regular whites, no racial angle would have been assumed. Just my guess.</p>

		<p>Arm yourselves my White brothers and sisters - and be prepared for anything. The savage hasgrown very, very bold of late and we are not safe. Enough of this whining and mewling about double-standards and how unfair it all is. This is evidently war and we need to conduct ourselves accordingly at all times. Be legal, but be safe.</p>

<p><i>Though robbery is a predominant motivation of the gang members, it is more complicated than that, Kelly said.</i></p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s more complicated than that. There&rsquo;s also the glaring (anti-white) <i>racial</i> element to this behavior. </p>
<p><br>
<i>The Denver Police Department announced today that they have made 32 arrests during a sweep to end a four-month spree of what police said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in downtown Denver</i></p>
<p><br>
Okay, so the Denver police have <i>said</i> these attacks were &#8220;racially motivated.&#8221; But will they <i>prosecute</i> them as racially motivated? Will the perps have &#8220;hatecrime&#8221; charges added to the other various assault and robbery charges? And if found guilty, will these &#8220;racially motivated&#8221; black criminals be sentenced to the additional years that are supposed to be added when the court has deemed a crime no ordinary crime but a &#8220;hatecrime&#8221;? </p>

		<p>  This isn&rsquo;t new behaviour, but it does seem to be more methodical, and probably coordinated. The Crips and BGD&rsquo;s are pretty much nationwide. I wouldn&rsquo;t count on this being just the acts of gangs. Brothers and sisters, be vigilant and stick together!<br>
From what I read here and have seen on video, all the victims are alone. Duly noted.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The offenders took wallets, iPods, cash and other small items.<br>
Most of the suspects admitted they belonged to either the Rollin&rsquo; 60s Crips gang or the Black Gangster Disciples gang.  Though robbery is a predominant motivation of the gang members, it is more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, as long as you&rsquo;re  &#8220;havin&rsquo; a little fun&#8221;, you might as well go the whole way and take their cash too.  Why not?</p>
<p>No big deal though.  This  harmless fun is just &#8220;endearing behavior&#8221; as some of our  black posters have enlightened us.  The youths are just being playful.   At least no one was killed or injured.   So what&rsquo;s all the silly fuss about?</p>
<p>Whites are so damned uptight!  They&rsquo;re unable to understand playful behavior.  And then these poor, playful youths are sent to jail for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!   &mdash;   (except stealing a few minor items).  What a rotten, racist system!</p>
<p>Obviously, <i>society has failed them. </i> It&rsquo;s all because society failed to provide enough basketball courts and youth programs.  Society needs to allocate more money, more youth counsellors, and community organizers. These youths are not at fault, society is the culprit!</p>

		<p> &#8220;No weeklong special on CNN?  No candlelight vigil and march against racism?  Guess this isn&rsquo;t the kind of racism the media [always want] to find.&#8221;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t what they want to find. And it won&rsquo;t be   &mdash;   <i>UNTIL this sort of thing starts happening to them.</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, with their $300,000. (and up)  salaries and in their safe, guarded communities, the media stars are untouched and  unconcerned.  And it doesn&rsquo;t look like they will be anytime soon.</p>
<p>They all learned in journalism school that the basic problem with the world is racism   &mdash;  (that means whites).  And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to continue to hear.  Every good socialist knows that &#8220;the white race is the cancer of history.&#8221;  Any reverse situations are just bizarre anomalies&hellip; not worthy of mention.</p>
<p>Liberalism is a kind of religion. And what we have here is the conflict between doctrine versus reality. Cognative dissonance.</p>

		<p>What is interesting is that these crimes are occurring despite (or because of?) decades of every manner of liberal social engineering and PC propaganda which were claimed to end &#8220;racism&#8221; in America. Yet the racial struggle seems to be picking up here, though it is definitely one-sided. Has someone, perhaps, failed to inform these gang-bangers that &#8220;race is a social construct?&#8221; Do we need to only require them to attend sensitivity seminars where they can learn to &#8220;embrace diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>One is reminded of the sort of crime reported in the new New South Africa. Crime takes on a political dimension as a form of terrorization of White people, the next step being quasi-ethnic cleansing. </p>

		<p>&#8220;When Kelly said gang members enjoy watching &ldquo;someone get beaten up like that,&rdquo; he was half right. They enjoy seeing WHITE someones getting beaten up like that. This is one of the things our idiotic news media, schools and government trumpeting of the &ldquo;legacy of slavery&rdquo; malarkey for the last 50-odd years have done. They have made these thugs think they have a RIGHT to beat up White people  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s a big game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesee Jackson and Al Sharpton and their white sympathizers have spent the last 30+ years spreading a doctrine that has created a mountain of dead bodies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that lightly. How many whites have been murdered, crippled, or raped by blacks over the last few decades? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? If all the caskets were stacked up in a pyramid shape, how big would it be? Literally, the size of a small mountain? Close to the size of the pyramids of Giza, surely? </p>
<p>And make no mistake  &mdash;  this ghastly spectacle IS largely the fault of Jesee and Co. They have spent their entire careers telling blacks that they are equal, and that any differences in income and status are due to white racism. </p>
<p>Well, if that is the case, then the only logical result is  &mdash;  at the very least  &mdash;  to hate white people. And not only that, but to see robbery and violence against whites as social justice, or DIY reparations. After all, how can it be really all that wrong if whites are villains?</p>
<p>The key to (somewhat) managing the bantu is simply this: realistic expectations. Stop telling them the lie of equality. Stop telling them to expect whitey&rsquo;s salary. Stop telling them to expect whitey&rsquo;s job, because it&rsquo;s high stress and long hours and you&rsquo;d be miserable anyhow. </p>
<p>Obviously this is not the magic key to curbing their behavior. There are the genetic issues of too much testosterone and not enough IQ, but we can&rsquo;t change that. But things used to be more manageable than they are now, because blacks just didn&rsquo;t expect to have what whites had, and were mostly content with that. </p>

		<p>Notice the word &#8220;racist&#8221; is not used in this article.  Why is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people about defending themselves in such an attack, and the primary response I get is that they don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;get in trouble&#8221; with the law.  I counter that they have a legal and moral right and obligation to fight back with all their might, and if some cop or district attorney tries to charge them with anything, the answer is to SUE the municipality in which the incident occured, charging civil rights violations and failure to protect the victim. We need to stop cowering and realize what we are dealing with here. </p>

My wife and I walk downtown (where we live). I am always armed. I encourage all whites living in a state allowing concealed carry to obtain a permit, and then learn how to use a pistol. Shot placement, not caliber, is key. I&rsquo;m cautious, but whenever we approach a black my hand is in my pant firmly grasping my pocket pistol. I make it a point to look them straight in the eye as we pass. I don&rsquo;t think blacks are used to that &mdash; most whites will not look a black directly in the eye, but instead lower their heads and cower. This is a mistake. The blacks I look dead in the eye can sense I am not to be messed with, and usually stand clear. On the other hand, if I see a group of blacks we always cross the street. It&rsquo;s no sense being stupid, and blacks tend to be pack attackers. Also, stay in more populated and lighted areas. Always keep your eyes moving around. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>My strategy is to live far from blacks, and simply never enter areas where they live.  Especially not at night.  What am I missing?  Nothing.  Distance, which is a disappearing luxury, is still the safest strategy.<br>

		<p>The best solution for the racial/economic degradation and drastic negative demographic shifts in this country is to elect people like Joe Wilson (who dared to yell out &#8220;You lied&#8221; to Obama).  This country can do it.  It is a good start with the Tea Party activities.  Candiates who are truly concerned for the survival of this country need to be supported in every way possible as currently only the wealthy or the well connected (Obama, no matter how corrupt) can run for office.  At it&rsquo;s present rate of degradation, the survival of this country is of serious concern.  In the past, this country has gone through severe economic busts but it was able to pick itself back up because of the overall I.Q. level of this country.    </p>

		<p>That Rolling 60&rsquo;s Crips were involved in racially-motivated attacks is no suprise.  They were attacking Koreans on sight here in Colorado Springs about 10 years ago.  These attacks included the execution-style shotgun murders of a pair of 13 year-old boys, merely because they were half Korean, and so looked vaguely Asian.</p>

		<p>As many of you Amrenners know, but some of you may not, SCOTUS has agreed to hear a Second Amendment case challenging Chicago&rsquo;s draconian gun laws, which include a handgun ban as stringent as D.C.&rsquo;s. The case is McDonald V. City of Chicago. At question is whether the Second Amendment is to be incorporated against the states and municipalities under the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Priviledges and Immunities, or Due Process Clauses.</p>
<p>Most legal observers predict that SCOTUS will rule in favor of incorporation, which means that Chicago&rsquo;s handgun ban will be struck down. The ruling is expected by June, 2010.</p>
<p>In the months preceding and after the 2008 presidential election,Americans went on a gun buying spree that hasn&rsquo;t really slowed. I predict that a ruling in McDonald favoring incorporation, will result in another massive gun-buying spree, ESPECIALLY by urban and suburban residents, in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Then, Caucasian, Asian and (responsible) Hispanic gunowners can serve notice to these black miscreants, that their attacks will not be tolerated. They will be shot in self-defense.     </p>

I respectfully xdisagree with you. I would encourage White people to be practiced and carry a firearm regardless of whether their state allows Concealed Carry. For example in New Jersey that will never be the case. What is important is that one protect oneself. The police can&rsquo;t arrest everyone. <br>

		<p>I lived in Denver for many years and the Rev Kelly is a former gang member and a convicted felon. If the races in this case were reversed Jackson and Sharpton would be demanding a FBI investigation and MSNBC would be blaming Sara Palin. Then the SPLC would be there to represent the poor black victims. And just a footnote, back in the early 90&rsquo;s in Denver there was a festival called Octoberfest it mainly was a celebration of white european culture. Anyway this white couple and their two teenage kids were there from out of town and just enjoying themselves when some black youths {thugs} started to harrass the teen girl. When her brother came to her aid one of the black thugs slashed him across the face with a broken bottle. The father was enraged and chased the black punk through the crowds. An undercover cop saw what was happening and grabed the black kid. When the still enraged father tried to get his hands on the punk he was charged with interfering with a police officer and attempted assault.</p>

		<p>This all reminds me of very similar incidents that have happened here in Austin, Texas. In the entertainment district - the so called 6th Street area - blacks have walked up, taunted &amp; slugged unsuspecting whites in the face. One young man died from this &amp; a few have been seriously injured.</p>
<p>Does a weak judicial system expect us to continually fall victim to these types of crimes? </p>
