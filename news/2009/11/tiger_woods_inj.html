<h1><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/11/28/tiger-woods-elin-nordegren-fight-accident-suv-lacerations/">Tiger Woods: Injuries Caused by Wife, Not SUV</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>TMZ, November 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tiger Woods did not suffer facial lacerations from a car accident. They were inflicted by his wife, Elin Nordegren  &mdash;  according to a conversation Woods had Friday after the accident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told he said his wife had confronted him about reports that he was seeing another woman. The argument got heated and, according to our source, she scratched his face up. We&rsquo;re told it was then Woods beat a hasty retreat for his SUV  &mdash;  but according to our source, Woods says his wife followed behind with a golf club. As Tiger drove away, she struck the vehicle several times with the club.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told Woods became &#8220;distracted,&#8221; thought the vehicle was stopped, and looked to see what had happened. At that point the SUV hit the fire hydrant and then hit a tree.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve laughed all weekend about this incident and &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger&rsquo;s bizarre behavior following it. At first I figured he was doped up, or blasted out of his mind on booze; now it turns out that he was attacked by his breeding pig for fornicating with another jungle fevered sow, and was zonked on prescription pain medications. Too darn funny if you ask me!</p>
<p>These two really deserve each other. She is nothing but a Swedish whore, who married this mongrelized abomination for his money; and he is an overrated and overpaid swaggering buffoon, who has begun to actually believe in his own &ldquo;greatness.&rdquo; As if having the terminally Marxstream media fawn on him, or swinging a golf club was really difficult and worthy of having &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; bestowed upon him. </p>
<p>Now his life (as is expected) is deteriorating into a glitzy trailer park edition of the Jerry Springer Show. And (as is equally expected) the Marxstream media spasmodically vacillates between maudlin concern for him, and wildly speculating on the juicy details of this &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; incident. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism at it finest ladies and gentlemen, you can&rsquo;t help but love it!<br>

		<p>The fact is that White athletes have behaved like this for years. Philandering is a part of the White male psyche. Now it seems that Non-White men are beginning to adopt such disgusting behavior by emulating White males.</p>

		<p>I have zero sympathy for any white woman who willingly enters into a union with a black male and then becomes an injured party.  It has been 40-50 years now, of forced integration both domestic and abroad, for any rational white woman to see exactly what black males, mixed or unmixed, truly are at their core: biologically incapable of marital fidelity, and worse, most often an eventual physical danger to their spouse.  Nordegren&rsquo;s rage was very likely a manifestation of having realized that she was and is, nothing but a once-but-no-longer trophy, and a breeding vessel that served her purpose and had been discarded.  She has arrived at the crushing reality that she can never return to being the white woman that she used to be, that she can never again be accepted by any white man, and her genetic line is forever lost to her.  Let this be another sad example to young white girls made maleable by the forces of multiculturalism, of the shame and emptiness that such a path will always lead to.</p>

Even though they have gorgeus blond wives they still need to prove are real men and are willing to risk losing their wives by cheating on them.</p>

		<p>She should have married a White golfer instead of the cool-black superman known as Tiger Woods. I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for her. Besides he has lots of money so she will stay with him. Money is what most White women want. A lot of the guys I know that agree with me on racial issues marry Asian women. One even married an American Indian. In a couple of generations we might have half-breed Whites that are more racially proud to be White than most full-blooded Whites. What irony!</p>

<p>Another black man bags a beautiful blonde wife and then finds that she isn&rsquo;t enough for him.  Blonde bimbo gets angry and like a barbarian attacks him and &#8220;scratches his face up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who knows what really happened?  We&rsquo;ll probably never know for certain.  But one would hope that other white women thinking of marrying a black, celebrity or not, might want to take a good look at this one&rsquo;s children that don&rsquo;t look at all like her, the husband who doesn&rsquo;t look remotely like her, and wonder if these basics might lead to the problems because she was initially and always just an object of acquisition.  </p>

<p>Please recall that back in &#8216;96 Woods introduced himself to the world w/a race-baiting Nike ad that claimed he was banned from some golf courses due to his skin color.<br>

		<p>The depravity that I have witnessed out of so many white women is a collective embarassment to our race, a very healthy percentage of them are extremely injurious to the plight of the white race and its survival. I am also puzzled by the seeming dismissal of so many of those concerned about the fate of the white race to deal with the genetic issue of intermarriage.  I do not think a political solution no matter how expedient or beneficial to whites can overcome the new behavioral standard of the modern white woman.</p>

<p>These domesitc dispute incidents happen in all marriages of all races, including interracial ones and many of you should know it. It is this sort of foolishness by some posters that demeans the goal that AMREN and some of us are working toward. </p>

		<p>Tiger Woods an his wife are part of the under 35 generation that thinks it is trendy, hip and even normal to engage in interracial sexual liasons and mariages. I live in an area of the nation where I see a large number of such unions - BM/WF,  WM/AF, WM/BF, WM/HF, HM/WF etc&hellip; It is predominately more commonplace among younger people.</p>

<p>Surely you jest, Howard. Asian women are very well known the world over for their single-minded devotion to money - it&rsquo;s the main reason they cosy up to white males. Money and citizenship in a Western country.</p>
<p>I could tell you many stories of silly Australian males who have had their assets stripped by Filipino and other Asian &#8216;wives&rsquo; to the detriment of their own children. The Australian mining magnate Lang Hancock paid the ultimate price for marrying an Asian vampire.   </p>

<p>This is just another case of interracial marriage gone wrong (not that it was ever right).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that a black would cheat on his wife.  They have a tendency to screw around (pun intended).  Look at the black illegitimacy rate, something like 70% of black children are born out of wedlock.  Compare that to other races.</p>

		<p>  The controlled media has built Tiger Wood into a contemporary black Icon and advertisement for multiculturalism. I think it&rsquo;s a role Mr. Wood neither really wanted nor is suited for. Unfortunately, when one becomes a public persona, your life is constantly under a media microscope. While the man is an undoubtedly great golfer, he is a poor sportsman and his family life leaves much to be desired.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seldom heard or read the opinion that Elin whopped him in the head with a club, resulting in his loss of consciousness. (Someone on this site DID opine that).  I thought that was probable from the minute I heard about the incident.  I&rsquo;ve also read only once the conjecture that he was just coming home at 2am and thus precipitated a wee-hours argument.  To me, that seems more plausible than the two being up half the night arguing.  Maybe something will emerge on a security camera, or, if a guard or neighbor observed him driving in late, they&rsquo;ll squeal.  Anyway, I think it&rsquo;s Tiger&rsquo;s and/or Elin&rsquo;s waffling about seeing the cops that hurts his image the most.  People who summon police 3 times to talk and then balk (especially letting them cool their heels for an hour) look like elitists.  Some cops probably think of him now as an uppity black man who&rsquo;s trying to jerk their chain.  </p>

		<p> &#8220;Overall, if Tiger doesn&rsquo;t want to sign a complaint, I don&rsquo;t see that the police can move forward. But they will as they want the publicity. They like TV time just as many others do.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
According to the law now (though I can&rsquo;t say specifically about Florida), in cases of domestic violence, the police MUST <br>
make an arrest, whether either party wants to file a complaint or not.  This is now required, and is not an option.</p>

		<p>More women are coming forward now.  Good!  And I&rsquo;m betting they&rsquo;re all going to be white, so to all you out there who pop up with some ridiculous assertion that blacks think their own women are attractive, here&rsquo;s another one for you.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how low and angry black women feel everytime one of these many scandals involving a black/white incident are reported?  It is always said white men resent white women with blacks, and, of course, it&rsquo;s true.  But did you ever consider that if white men are angered black women are ready to go ballistic?  A black male/white female pairing is an insult to every black woman in the world.</p>
<p>This blond bimbo who married that unattractive thing is going to go through what she deserves, and her life is going to come apart at the seams.  Anguish and chaos will be her constant partners.  There is a little bit of justice after all.</p>
<p>The ultimate insult would be for him to get custody of the kids when they divorce, which is a VERY REAL possibility, because she&rsquo;ll probably be in jail for assault.</p>

<p>Yes, they are public figures.  Woods sought a career in the public spotlight, a career which has made him a famous figure and even a celebrated role model for blacks,  but not without strings attached.  He has gotten very rich from all that public attention.   He wanted to be a celebrity, so he has to accept what comes with it.  He wants to be rich and famous, but he wants his privacy too?  Sorry, you can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>

<p>Actually, there is evidence that she was raped. She says that he choked her and held her down and raped her. She had marks around her neck consistant with  being choked and bruises on her arms consistant with being held down plus DNA evidence. What she did previously has no bearing on the facts in this particular incident. However, she dropped the charges because of the hassle of the media publicity.</p>

		<p>Howard - it isn&rsquo;t just white women who are interested in men with money.  Traditionally, women seek men who can offer wealth and status (from an evolutionary perspective, this is because those men will be better able to provide for any children that they produce together) while men seek women based on their youth and beauty (again, from an evolutionary perspective, younger women in top physical condition were more likely to be fertile and to produce healthy babies).</p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me understand why some posters like Toto cannot admit that some Whites are guilty of bad behavior and poor judgement like other people. It does not make us race traitors to make such claims, although they see it that way.</p>

&#8220;Two things about Kobe Bryant:<br>
a) His wife is &lsquo;hispanic&rsquo; (Mexican). She is not black.</p>
<p>She looks black.  Incidentally what does this have to do with anything?</p>
<p>&#8220;b) While I nor anyone else but those involved know whether or not Kobe raped the white girl, it is well known she was an NBA groupie. Not that I like that bit of info, but it does show that the brainwashing constantly being tossed our way via the media and academia does have an effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant is a rapist for certain.  Anybody that doesn&rsquo;t know that has got to be too gullible for his own good. Non-rapists don&rsquo;t settle a rape case out of court for millions of dollars if they&rsquo;re innocent.  What part of that don&rsquo;t you understand?</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiger Woods is typical of a lot of &lsquo;stars&rsquo;, whether they are athletes, actors, musicians or politicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is a black adulterer.  Whether anybody else might be as well is totally immaterial to him or his actions.  <br>

		<p>As a white woman, what on earth do other white females see in black men anyway?  Are they that delusional not to realize that they are likely to be cheated on and/or beaten and possibly murdered?  Then again, when I worked in the trades, I had <br>
plenty of opportunities  to witness pathological black male behaviour.  The military was a real eye-opener too.  I blame parents to some extent for this situation.  They need to warn their daughters that for the sake of safety, if nothing else, black males should be avoided.<br>

<p>Deniz:  &#8220;Contradiction alert!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about White men who marry or date non-white women? How many of them were/are disowned? It seems there are a lot of them right here on Amren&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The subject was white women marrying black males, yet you point out that some white men marry &#8220;NON-WHITES.&#8221;</p>
<p>What has that to do with black males who are violent, killing, maiming or seriously assaulting white women?  I mean that&rsquo;s why the point was made that white women should be disowned if they take up with a black male.</p>
<p>You have some problem drawing accurate parallels with points you contest.  In this case you called it a &#8220;Contradiction Alert,&#8221; yet you provided no logical contradiction.</p>
<p>The inaccuracy you wrote is called &#8220;black logic&#8221;, because it&rsquo;s so far off the mark, which is typical of blacks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:  Jared Taylor was on Queen Latifah&rsquo;s show wherein he pointed out that profiling among those who are most apt to commit crime is logical, and that black males commit more crime per their share of the population than any other group. </p>
<p>A black woman stood up and said that most serial killes are white, and the other blacks in the audience, just as dense as she was, applauded vigorously and cheered as if she just shot his argument down.  Really pitiful.  Such an inability to understand problems, and if problems can&rsquo;t be understood they can&rsquo;t be solved.  That&rsquo;s why black run governments are total failures.  They&rsquo;re too dense to really understand anything beyond a grade school level.</p>

<p>That has absolutely nothing do with the issue.  Bad behavior and poor judgement in a white girl have nothing to do with trying to naively get people to believe a strange woman would spontaneously submit to an unattractive black, plus the other evidence in the case that the girl was raped is overwhelming.  </p>
<p>The lady in the case was in tears afterward, immediately telling a co-worker of the incident and asking what she should do, since this black freak was a celebrity. That was verified, along with tons of other information.</p>
<p>The longer you harp on this subject the more I&rsquo;m going to point out other verifiable evidence against Bryant, so it&rsquo;s hurting your disgusting desire to try to claim Bryant and Tiger Woods  are blameless or that they do what is the norm among celebrities.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It does not make us race traitors to make such claims, although they see it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a race traitor anymore.  I think you&rsquo;re black.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s all the fuss? He was just a black man being a black man.<br>
So, what else would she expect? Did she think he would make a devoted Swedish husband?</p>
<p>Yes, I know -  some people will retort that white men cheat and mess around too.   And that&rsquo;s true, SOME of them do.   But not so many and not so much. As with everything else, from homicide to AIDS, black men just do it MORE.  That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s significant: it&rsquo;s all in the proportions.  Tom-cattin&rsquo; around is a black thing.  Fidelity is alien to them.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hardly the first superstar athlete to cheat on his wife. Kobe did it with a black wife waiting at home; Alex Rodriguez, not married, screws anything that moves, age irrelevant(that&rsquo;s you, Madonna).&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is common in the NBA, which is composed of over 80% black, but what would be the percent of white men cheating on their wives in the PGA? The PGA probably is made up of at least 90% white, so it would be interesting to see how the percentages of cheating men in the NBA and the PGA would compare. </p>
