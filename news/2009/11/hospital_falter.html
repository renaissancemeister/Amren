<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/health/policy/21grady.html?_r=2">Hospital Falters as Refuge for Illegal Immigrants</a></h1>

<p>Like other hospitals, particularly public hospitals, Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta] has been left to provide costly treatments to nonpaying illegal residents who most likely could not have obtained such care in their home countries. American taxpayers and health care consumers have borne the expense.</p>
<p>Over time, the mounting losses have compromised Grady&rsquo;s charitable mission, forcing layoffs, increases in fees and the elimination of services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Years and years of providing this free care has led Grady to the breaking point,&#8221; said Matt Gove, one of the hospital&rsquo;s senior vice presidents. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials at Grady, which will provide more than $300 million in uncompensated care this year, estimate that as many as a fifth of its uninsured patients are illegal immigrants. Although the numbers are elusive, a national study by the RAND Corporation concluded that illegal immigrants account for about 1.3 percent of public health spending.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the Grady dialysis patients have chosen to return to their countries, encouraged by the hospital&rsquo;s offer of free airfare, cash payments, three months of paid dialysis and assistance in seeking insurance or other long-term remedies. Others are trying their luck in states where Medicaid policies may be less restrictive.</p>
<p>But most remain in Atlanta, taking full advantage of a last-minute offer by the hospital, in response to a lawsuit, to pay for three months of dialysis at commercial clinics. They are hopeful that the reprieve will buy time for the lawsuit to progress or for private dialysis providers to take them as charity cases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This is exactly why the illegals are here.  We have provided them free everything, at the expense of our own legal taxpayers who are paying for the illegals&rsquo; costs.  Why the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t see this is a profound mystery to me.  But it is part of the socialist/marxist agenda, and that is why I am willing to do whatever needs to be done to GET RID of it, and get back to caring for OUR citizens first, last, and only.</p>

		<p>One day, a hospital in the US is going to start refusing care to illegals because there is no other way to stay open.  They will be sued, of course, they will lose, and go out of business.</p>
<p>The counter suits will come, complaining that communities have the right to have medical care available&hellip;.and the ONLY viable solution is to allow the refusal of care to illegals.  Once one hospital gets away with it, it will spread all over the US.</p>
<p>The process will accelerate dramatically once the federal government runs out of money.  The current &#8220;healthcare reform&#8221; going on is nothing more than the last gasp of the federal government to delay this as long as possible.  But they have a very interesting problem.  They are out of money and the system by which they get more is broken.  They think they can keep the system running a bit longer via taxes.  But they don&rsquo;t know the history of this in the US.  All prior attempts have failed.  People simply stop paying taxes.  That is what the current economic &#8220;downturn&#8221; is really all about.  Businesses shutting down rather than pay taxes.  You watch.  A bunch of people will be elected who will shut down the government rather than tax (basically because they know it is pointless&hellip;.their power to get their hands on the cash is limited, lol, and they know it).  Suddenly, our economy will explode in new growth.</p>
<p>Fascism is when the government subverts corporatism.  But in the last 50 years, the power of the corporation has grown far more than the power of the state.  Or put another way, the average person NEEDS the corporation&hellip;.for a job, for stuff&hellip;.for the very food they put in their mouths.  But we don&rsquo;t need the government for anything really.  In fact, most of our problems can be traced directly to the government.</p>
<p>Again.  Healthcare reform is a good example.  Why are people so up in arms about the government taking over this huge part of the corporate world?  Because their corporate insurance company, medical providers etc. do for them.  And the government does not.  It really is as simple as that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get worse&hellip;far worse.</p>

		<p>Here in Canada, socialized medical care for one and all is as attractive to third-world immigrants and &#8216;refugees&rsquo; in the same way that nectar is to a bee. In my neighbourhood, all I see are white people for the most part, unless I pay a visit to the local walk-in medical clinic. You can wait for quite a while to see a doctor &#8216;free of charge&rsquo;, but what&rsquo;s even more distasteful is the hordes of third worlders clustered in the waiting room.</p>
<p>On the other hand, dental care in Canada is not free - you get private insurance coverage, or you pay out of pocket. Although dental care is provided to &#8216;needy&rsquo; cases free of charge, a dentist friend of mine told me that the dental equipment and resulting treatment is pretty abysmal for such cases. At my dentist, an immigrant dude (maybe a Somali) was talking to the receptionist, and she made it pretty clear to him that with no insurance coverage, he was paying up front before he even got in to see the dentist. Maybe that should be the standard &#8216;welcome mat approach&rsquo; western countries should &#8216;provide&rsquo; to third worlders, regardless of what type of health care they seek.<br>

<p>Roger that!!, especially and specifically, CONGRESS and SENATE along with all of their give away freebies and pandering to illegals and enemy countries/groups/organizations..The same sort of circus acts went on in Nazi Germany as the door was closing on them in WWII, it didn&rsquo;t help them, and it won&rsquo;t help our own government.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s what this healthcare agenda Obama has is all about. Once to get the illegals legalized and get them free voucher verified insurance then illegals will flock to this country like never before. </p>
<p>Thus sinking white dominance of our social systems.</p>

<p>Free services means NOTHING paid.  Even countries with socialized medicine are having financial difficulties that mostly manifest in longer waiting periods and higher taxes.  Socialized medicine was doing fine until high numbers of illegal immigrants and low wage laborers showed up in Europe and Canada.  <br>

<p>Especially if we take into consideration the way the government has allowed corporations to take over everything, including every aspect of health care.</p>
<p>You are advocating anarchy, which is a believes that every individual can best determine how to live without anyone else.  That means no borders, no army, no police, no agencies that insure health, safety or civil protection.  In such a state of affairs, I predict that the feudal system arises with strongmen on the top.  The strongment fight for control and with one another.  The standard of living by that time will be similar to Europe in about the 8th century.  Have fun.<br>

		<p>The healthcare system can only support a limited number of non-paying customers. The feds may think that a shortfall can be made up somehow by raising taxes on Whites and paying doctors less, but they are mistaken.</p>
