	<p>East Harlem is not on the menu.</p>
<p>Area residents are outraged that some East Side restaurants refuse to deliver 15 blocks north to their predominantly minority neighborhood  &mdash;  yet are willing to trek a mile to fill orders on the wealthy Upper East Side.</p>
<p>The restaurants include Chinese Mirch on Second Avenue between 94th and 95th streets, and One Fish Two Fish on Madison Avenue and 97th Street.</p>
<p>Both establishments refused to deliver dinner 15 blocks north to East Harlem when called by a Post reporter posing as a customer. But they readily offered to make a longer, 20-block trek in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The iron curtain of cuisine &#8220;smacks of racism,&#8221; said Harlem state Sen. Bill Perkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference between north and south is black and white,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The manager of One Fish Two Fish denied any bias, even though his eatery refused to make a delivery to 112th Street and Madison Avenue, but did fill the reporter&rsquo;s order farther away on 77th Street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chinese Mirch refused to send food to 110th Street and Second Avenue but had no problem going to faraway 75th Street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One Fish&rsquo;s manager, a woman who called herself Veronica and would not give a last name, maintained that the seafood place does deliver to East Harlem. &#8220;We are like an urban Cheers,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cater to an African-American and Hispanic clientele. We are a multicultural restaurant. We do not discriminate according to areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the eatery&rsquo;s delivery radius extends only 10 blocks in each direction, which is why the order may have been refused.</p>
<p>But the Post was able to fill an order 20 blocks south. And Brian Connolly, 42, claimed he had a similar experience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city Human Rights Commission said that it would investigate.<br>

		<p>I always read stories about delivery guys being mugged here in NYC.  If I owned a place I wouldn&rsquo;t send them where those things happened.  Also it was probably way outside of their delivery area.  Though for good customers and big orders I can see why they&rsquo;d extend it a bit.</p>

		<p>They are trying to sugar-coat the real problem&hellip;what&rsquo;s the upside to delivering in an area where you&rsquo;re likely to get robbed, mugged, raped, or killed and the tips are lousy if you do manage to get to your destination in one piece? It&rsquo;s about crime vs. no-crime, and realistically that translates to black vs. white areas. Only a fool would risk his life to deliver a meal in a black area to keep up PC pretenses&hellip;</p>

		<p>It speaks volumes about the people of Harlem that in a deep recession restaurants would turn away their business.  Obviously, they&rsquo;ve  delivered to the area before and experienced people either not paying for the food they ordered and/or violence being used against delivery drivers.  The owners of these businesses have two options: they can be politically correct and risk getting shot and killed or be branded a &#8220;racist&#8221; and live to see another day.  For any sane-minded individual, its an obvious decision, but then again, this country went insane a long time ago.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s never explained is why a restaurant would refuse to service a particular area if not for a good reason. I mean, what is to be gained by excluding 10% or more of potential customers? And if a restaurant&rsquo;s behavior was irrational, what would stop its competitors from filling the void? All this hand-wringing and &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; beaurocracy always ignores this point. </p>
<p>The restaurants probably avoided that area because of a large amount of crank calls and crime.</p>

<p>I think it should be a &#8220;Human Right&#8221; to not be mugged, beaten up or raped.  Businesses have an obligation to their employees to safeguard their safety as much as possible.  Sending them to high-crime areas (black areas) would violate that responsibility.  It would violate their human rights.</p>

<p>Funny, when I get my paycheck every other week, there is never extra &ldquo;enrichments&rdquo; for me in some diversity column on it. Oh, I get them in some ways that I would rather not, even in the places I pay to frequent or live in, but I never get a tangible monetary or even tax-deductible reimbursement for them.</p>
<p>Maybe if I owned a &ldquo;multicultural restaurant,&rdquo; I would?</p>

<p>Should I invest in one, with multiculturalism as the main pillar of the business plan; or should I just buy some magic beans and a flying carpet instead?</p>

		<p>Why is it SO hard for these people to tell the truth about why they don&rsquo;t want to deliver in certain areas? Just SAY IT! They are afraid to venture into those neighborhoods, and with darn good reason! Racism my foot! The residents in these areas know good and well that has nothing to do with it. When they yell racism, yell right back with crime stats from the police dept. Tell them they will not deliver in those areas, because they refuse to put their employees lives in danger. Stand up to these people! Make them acknowledge the truth for once. </p>

		<p>Why does the muck-raking Post go and stir up trouble like this? Shame on them!  We all know good and well that the difference between going north and going south (in Manhattan)  is not just &#8220;the difference between black and white&#8221;.  It is the difference between getting a nice tip in one location and getting robbed or murdered in the other.  Who&rsquo;s kidding anyone? </p>
<p>No establishment turns down business willingly, but nobody is willing to get killed in reaching for that business either. An order in Harlem just isn&rsquo;t worth all the trouble and the risk. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that even the Chinese know that. So now they&rsquo;re as &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; as us wicked whites?   My, my!  I thought we had racism born us &#8220;from birth&#8221; [see Jane Elliott] &hellip; but what explains it with the Chinese?</p>

		<p>Those delivery people for the restaurant put themselves in actual mortal danger when they go into some neighborhoods. Often the call-in is a set up to rob or just plain attack the deliveryman. Those deliverymen too get stiffed by &#8220;patrons&#8221; from certain areas that are well known to the restaurants.</p>
<p>Even my local Pizza Hut has the wall map with certain areas that are circled in a manner to say &#8220;NO GO&#8221;! </p>

		<p>In L.A. food delivery can be deadly in black and hispanic neighborhoods, so it isn&rsquo;t done, simple as that. Restaurants have no problems delivering food to White and Asian neighborhoods however. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. Blacks and hispanics have only themselves to blame. </p>

		<p>I used to live on the Upper East Side on 90th St. Basically, the boundary is 96th Street. If you go over to Fifth Ave. which faces Central Park, it may go up to 97th or 98th Street, but basically, 96th St. is the dividing line. Below 96th St. it&rsquo;s almost all White. Above 96th St. it&rsquo;s mainly Puerto Rican. Of course, that turns into Harlem and blacks as you go further north. </p>
<p>Everyone in Manhattan, especially those who live on the East Side, knows this. Above 96th St. it&rsquo;s dangerous. Below 96th St. it&rsquo;s White and pretty much safe. </p>
<p>Instead of whining about discrimination, why don&rsquo;t they talk about the crime stats? Do they really think restaurants and take-out places don&rsquo;t want to make money?</p>
<p>By the way, there used to be a little Italian enclave up around 120th St. It&rsquo;s probably gone now, but nobody ever messed with those Italians. </p>

<p>More likely in this case, the DIFFERENCE is crime and safety.</p>
<p>Something -a bit- like this was shown in an old episode of CAGNEY AND LACY a good number of years ago. The episode explored the issue of racial prejudice (from the standpoint of liberal Hollywood writers of course). In one scene, Cagney(?) was leaving a show with her date and there was a black couple hailing a cab. The cab driver, who was White, declined the black fare, saying he was unwilling to risk going into Harlem that late at night. This was presented as &#8220;racism&#8221; that blacks have to routinely face. Even then as a naive Canadian youth I didn&rsquo;t buy it. The cab driver was declining the fare because he was afraid for his safety. That is not and never can be &#8220;racism&#8221;. Does anyone else recall that episode? It was very biased and unfair. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering if restaurants in East Harlem deliver in their own neighbourhood? If not, it would appear that there is an excellent business opportunity here for one of those much hyped black business ventures we hear so much about. &#8220;The city Human Rights Commission said that it would investigate&#8221;. Investigate the restaurants or investigate these alleged robberies? I would have thought this is more of a police matter, assuming the are willing to wander around Harlem asking questions about suspected criminals.</p>

		<p>Maybe 20 years ago there was a similar stink about pizza delivery men refusing to go to certain neighborhoods after one of them was killed.  The local human rights crowd backed down when they were faced with a mob of pizza men with signs saying &#8220;I won&rsquo;t die for a five dollar pie&#8221;  Anybody remember what city that was?  </p>

		<p>I walked all the way from grand Central Station to Harlem one brisk morning. I got a reeaal bad feeling right around 112th street which I believe is more Spanish Harlem than pure Harlem. The posts and the story seem to bear out my intuitions. The only hassle I got in Harlem on 124th Street  was by a lunch counter lady who wouldn`t let me sit at a table since I was by myself. When the homeboy who ALWAYS sat at the spot I occupied at the counter came in, he went off. I simply referred him to the employee who had directed me to sit there. He sat down next to me and tried to make life difficult, complaining and mumbling threats. Since I was 6&#8221; taller and about 70 pounds heavier there wasn`t a whole lot else he could do I guess. On the way home I hoofed it back to about 85th street before getting on the subway. It just seemed to be a better tactical decision than getting &#8220;Locked in&#8221; on a moving subway&hellip;</p>

		<p>East 96th St. in Manhattan is a &#8220;super-boundary&#8221;, at least when I lived in the upper east side from 1985-1994.  Below that boundary; prosperous, mainly white, people, &amp; expensive living.  Above it, all the way through &amp; including &#8220;The Bronx&#8221; to lower Westchester Co.; blacks, crack, public drunks, whores, thugs, gangs, third-worlders, crime, etc.  All New Yorkers knew this.

		<p>We had this trouble at a pizza delivery place I worked for in college.  Three drivers were robbed in some black section 8 apartments and the owners stopped delivering there.  They were threatened with lawsuits.</p>
<p>I kept racial statistics, as well as others, regarding the tips I received.  The average white tip was $1.37 while the average black tip was 12 cents.  The black amount was skewed by one black man who always tipped $5.</p>
<p>Drivers always complained when they had to take a pizza to a black. The black drivers fared no better in getting tips from blacks.  </p>
<p>I think blacks have always been judged on the &#8220;content of their character&#8221;, it&rsquo;s just that in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s people that had no exposure to blacks assumed the TV was telling the truth when they said blacks are just like whites except darker.</p>

		<p> People who run restaurants are in business to make money. If they won&rsquo;t deliver to Harlem, they have valid reasons. The safety of their employees must take precedence over a few sales. I guess in multicultural America this is racism. </p>

		<p>Really,just another example of how doing business with blacks just isn&rsquo;t worth the risk and effort. Were it not for civil rights lawyers and government thugs pointing guns at civilized folk to force them to interact with blacks,the black population in this country would have long since been starved into behaving themselves.</p>

		<p>Here in Hartford there was a double shooting in front of a nightclub frequented by blacks so the city health department used some bogus excuse to shut them down for a while as if the business was responsible for the conduct of patrons on the street. Then there was another shooting outside a popular pizza joint that had late night hours to serve those leaving the clubs - the solution was to force the business to close earlier yet time after time after time in Hartford food delivery people are stabbed, shot and robbed yet the idea of these businesses being allowed to refuse to deliver to the dark side of town is out of the question.<br>
The city will do ANYTHING but face the problem of black violence honestly, unjustly blaming and penalizing legal law abiding business owners or just burying their heads in the sand and denying it.</p>

		<p>Perhaps several members of New York&rsquo;s co-called Civil Rights Division would like go undercover and work for several weeks as delivery personnel for these restaurants in the area of Harlem. This would help them verify that the restaurant owners&rsquo; fears are utterly groundless and provide a basis for their prosecution.</p>

Has it ever occured to ANYONE who lives in this area, that there might be a market here for a local Harlem delivery service? Surely, with all the Affirmative Action around, there would be grants and subsidies for anyone who had the gumption to do this?  Just a thought. </p>

<p>If I remember correctly they held firm and ignored the race baiters and the problem went away.  These restraunts should do the same.  Just give it a few months until there&rsquo;s another &#8220;outrage&#8221; to grab the race baiter&rsquo;s attention spans, which are so short.</p>

		<p>When I was delivering pizza, most of the drivers for the store I worked for did not deliver to the Com-Cor halfway house, which seemed a bit nonsensical to me.  The place was crawling with staff, and the inhabitants were happy to be out of prison and tipped quite well.  In the end, the store simply quit delivering to the place, since they were stuck with a mixture of some drivers who would go there and others who would not.</p>
<p>The problem here is that to someone paying for their own gasoline and simply making minimum wage plus tips, the very real risk of being killed or badly hurt is simply not worthwhile.</p>
<p>A valid question is why the nation&rsquo;s Al Sharptons have not started up pizza-delivery restaurants in these areas if the fears of white and Asian delivery drivers are baseless.  Rich, liberal dingbats who work for newspapers and &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; commissions could pony up the venture capital money and send their college-age children to work as the delivery drivers.</p>

		<p>The only way this could be racism is that the restaurants would refuse to deliver to anyone deemed to be black.  You think they would decline to bring takeout to an office of black lawyers?  It&rsquo;s simply a matter of going into dangerous parts of the city, regardless of their ethnic makeup.  I hope these eateries stick to their principles here, and hopefully there&rsquo;s nothing any commission can do about it.  Money is green, and most businesses don&rsquo;t care who they get it from, so it&rsquo;s almost always bad behavior that causes problems for any racial group.</p>

		<p>This article is a good example of the coddled, liberal perspective. Here we have a well-educated writer working for a big city paper who is going to wag her (his? I can&rsquo;t tell from the name) finger at the minimum-wage pizza guys for not Celebrating Diversity enough.</p>
<p>I delivered pizzas in my youth, in a town much less Diverse than NYC. There were areas you just didn&rsquo;t deliver to if you cared at all for your safety. Delivery guys are a good score for muggers and the ghetto dwellers are well aware of this fact.</p>
<p>I suspect that Mr. (Ms.?) Reuven Blau has not had the experience of making deliveries to Diverse neighborhoods.   </p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t know. I never heard of it. But I live in New York, and I doubt that many of them deliver at all.   Delivering just isn&rsquo;t a Harlem sort of thing.  And with good reason.  Also, the restaurants there aren&rsquo;t the kind of establishments that deliver. You go to them, they don&rsquo;t come to you.</p>

		<p>I used to deliver pizzas in college, in San Francisco.  There were no go areas that we did not deliver to because they put the driver in danger of being mugged.  I actually aborted a delivery one night in a black residential neighborhood because as I was driving slowly up the street in heavy fog, looking for the address, two thugs in hoodies noticed me, and started walking up the street towards my car.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether they wanted to sell me drugs, or mug me.  I didnt care to find out.  I went back to the store, told the manager what happened, and he was fine with it. This is not racism. Every business wants to make money.  They just don&rsquo;t want to lose it to a mugger, and have their employees hurt or killed in the process.  It&rsquo;s easy to set a food delivery person up for a mugging, they are alone, in the dark, and carrying up to a couple of hundred dollars in cash.  If the city can somehow force these restaurants to deliver to these crime-ridden areas, they should charge them extra for hazard pay. That way the drivers can afford to arm themselves.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The iron curtain of cuisine &#8220;smacks of racism,&#8221; said Harlem state Sen. Bill Perkins.&#8221;</p>
<p>I used to think that blacks were simply delusional about crime  &mdash;  that they saw the overwhelming rates of black criminality, and imagined racism where there was none. Now I believe they simply approve of and support crime, so long as it is not directed against themselves.</p>
<p>Michigan congressmen support tariffs and so forth against imported cars, Texas congressmen support relaxing restrictions on offshore drilling, Iowa politicians support corn subsidies, and so forth. And black politicians support victim disarmament/endangerment legislation, for the same reason  &mdash;  a large portion of their political base is employed in an industry they wish to protect and nuture  &mdash;  namely, criminal activity and predatory behavior. </p>
<p>Simply put, they want their constituents to have a safe and comfortable working environment where they can make a good living without undue struggle, just like white politicians. Victim disarmament/endangerment legislation is basically OSHA for black thugs. The criminals themselves may not be able to vote their approval (seeing as how they are barred from voting), but their semi-civilized friends/family/neighbors sympathize with them and vote accordingly. </p>

		<p>How typucal!  Blacks only commit about 60 percent of the violent crimes in this counry, but they won&rsquo;t take one iota of reponsibility for this fact.  Instead, it&rsquo;s always &#8220;a lack of jobs,&#8221;  or that good old one size fits all excuse, racism.  Here in Nashville, the blacks complain about a lack of supermarkets in their neighborhoods.  Yet miracalously, they never make the connection between their own violent behavior and resulting lack of services.  Business people don&rsquo;t care about race, only the color of green.  Also, a decent business person is not going to risk the safety of his employees.  Until blacks grow up (if ever) this pathetic pattern will continue.</p>

		<p>Back in roughly 1992 I fought a battle to get a delivery area pulled while working at a pizza chain. The owners hated the idea, they were afraid of someone suing on a racial claim, and still wanted the money out of the area that delivering there made them. They were also afraid of getting stuck with the hospital bills for employees getting hurt there, and of the knowledge that if they continued sending us down there, eventually some of us would end up being armed trying to defend ourselves, company policy or otherwise. </p>
<p> Think back to that time, Rodney King, extreme hatred for whites flaring up in the black community. I had a molotov thrown at me while making a delivery into the predominately black part of our delivery area. I saw a group of blacks on the side of the street and didn&rsquo;t think too much of it until I was startled by the smash of my windshield. I survived that attack merely because they had chosen a 40oz bottle rather than something easier to break like a wine bottle for their delivery mechanism, and the bottle simply shattered the window of my vehicle without breaking, and exploding. </p>
<p>As I floored it out of there I came across another much larger group of blacks, and I had to drive through the middle of that. They had dragged the Arab owner of the liquor, and grocery store out of his store, pummeled him to death with rocks, and bricks, and were doing a celebratory dance around his dead body as they continued to smash his head in with rocks, and bricks. They later burned down his store after it was looted. The police couldn&rsquo;t even enter the area because of being out manned. </p>
<p>Like a lot of cities with a large black population, we had our share of incidents, and riots at that time, but the area was always a problem, and always risky to do business in. </p>
<p>Two blocks away, and a month prior another driver was assaulted with baseball bats by several blacks at an apartment complex.  They broke several bones in his body, and he had to have surgery to attempt to fix his knees, hands, and jaw. A few weeks prior to that we had another driver robbed, but thankfully not hurt in the black area. Roughly a week after that incident another chain had a driver who survived being shot in an apartment complex on the edge of our delivery area (also in the black part of town). That apartment complex had a long, and troubled history with us, and other pizza delivery chains there. It had some residences that were on the inside of it   &mdash;   so you had to walk a long way from your vehicle down an unlit corridor, and then were on the inside of the buildings where no one could see in very narrow stairwells with plenty of places for attackers to hide. I hated going in there, and always took my 5 cell mag-lite with me to discourage problems.   </p>
<p>More recently in another town not far from me, a pizza delivery driver was beaten, and raped by two black attackers in the black part of their delivery area. The residents (97% black) wouldn&rsquo;t even open their doors to help the bloodied and battered white pizza delivery woman. None of them called the police or offered to help her. </p>
<p>Those of you from St Louis probably know the incidents I refer to. With any type of delivery company, you can pick the time, and place your victim arrives. ANI used to help that a little bit, but in the era of disposable cell phones, the little bit of protection that offers is largely gone. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Harlem, but if their problems are like St Louis, its no wonder the businesses don&rsquo;t want to deliver there. Doing business in predominantly black areas is dangerous. Pizza delivery ranks above police, and fire fighters in the most dangerous occupations largely because of delivery to these areas.  </p>
