<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=115542">What&rsquo;s Behind America&rsquo;s Politically Correct &#8216;Love&rsquo; of Islam?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Kupelian, WorldNetDaily, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The second they heard about the Fort Hood massacre, millions of thinking Americans wondered in their gut: &#8220;Oh God, is this another crazy Muslim terrorist carrying out a one-man jihad, as has happened so many times before?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, when the alleged perpetrator&rsquo;s name and religion were made public (Nidal Malik Hasan, a lifelong Muslim) along with eyewitness reports he had shouted the obligatory pre-terror-attack proclamation, &#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; (&#8220;Allah is greatest&#8221;) before commencing his orgy of slaughter, their suspicions were confirmed: This was surely a major attack on the American homeland by a Muslim terrorist.</p>
<p>Further evidence quickly rolled in: {snip}</p>
<p>In other words, although the Army had many warnings Hasan was a certifiable, America-hating, jihadist &#8220;ticking time bomb&#8221; waiting to go off, it did nothing to avert last week&rsquo;s terror attack. Why?</p>
<p>And why, after the truth about Hasan became undeniable following his mass slaughter, does the government, as well as its mouthpiece the establishment press, agonize in their usual pathetic manner over what could possibly have motivated the Army psychiatrist to coldly, methodically murder 13 and wound 38 others?<blockquote>* Shortly after the attack, right on schedule, the FBI announced it wasn&rsquo;t terror-related.</p>
<p>* Time magazine moronically blamed posttraumatic stress disorder  &mdash;  even though Hasan has never been deployed in a war zone.</p>
<p>* The shooter&rsquo;s relatives insisted he had been the victim of religious harassment because of his faith, which must have made him snap.</p>
<p>* According to the Washington Post, the problem was that Hasan was lonely. That&rsquo;s right, the newspaper&rsquo;s report, titled &#8220;The lonely life of alleged Fort Hood shooter,&#8221; was subtitled: &#8220;&#8216;He was mistreated. He didn&rsquo;t have nobody. He was all alone,&rsquo; says neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Meanwhile, President Obama warned Americans against &#8220;jumping to conclusions&#8221; about what might have motivated the shooter.<br>
</blockquote>Why, after a Muslim commits a terrorist act, do authorities always announce almost instantaneously  &mdash;  before they could possibly know  &mdash;  that the attack was not terror-related?</p>
<p>Why do the news media always torture themselves and their readers with the most wildly improbable explanations in their attempts to avoid the obvious truth?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Everyone attributes it to &#8220;political correctness,&#8221; but I think it&rsquo;s time to move beyond that shallow, pass√©, near-meaningless phrase.</p>
<p>Do we dare admit what is <em>really</em> at play here? The truth is actually very simple.</p>
<p>We are afraid of Islam.</p>
<p>We are intimidated by Islam.</p>
<p>And because we are afraid of and intimidated by Islam, Islam is changing us  &mdash;  in two distinct and profound ways.</p>
<p>First, as is appallingly obvious, we&rsquo;re afraid to criticize Islam openly, for fear of having our head cut off or having a fatwa put out on us like the director of the new &#8220;2012&#8221; film, or we&rsquo;re afraid of being sued by some of the very litigious Islamic organizations like CAIR, or we&rsquo;re afraid of being called a racist, extremist, hater or &#8220;Islamophobe&#8221; thanks to the tyranny of political correctness, or we&rsquo;re afraid of offending those in power and thereby risking our position, stature or other advantage. This reaction, while perhaps selfish and cowardly, is more-or-less conscious and strategic.</p>
<p>However, for some it goes much deeper: Being intimidated by Islam (or by anything, for that matter) actually causes some of us to mysteriously grow sympathetic toward it, to defend it, to side with it, even to convert to it. This unconscious shift in attitude, in response to fear of being hurt, is called the Stockholm syndrome, named after the 1973 Swedish bank robbery during which the four terrorized hostages sided with their criminal captors while disparaging the police risking their lives trying to save them.</p>
<p>We need to understand that a certain percentage of us, when we&rsquo;re intimidated and upset, start to emotionally gravitate toward and agree with whatever is intimidating us. Not just superficially, as a temporary tactic of placating a bully so he won&rsquo;t hurt us, but more profoundly, deep down in the inner sanctum of our being where our thoughts and feelings germinate and our loyalties bloom.</p>
<p>Intimidation  &mdash;  that is, causing others to react with upset and fear  &mdash;  is a fundamental principle of mind control, fully capable of causing the victim&rsquo;s loyalties to shift toward the intimidator, whether a schoolyard bully, gang leader, child molester, hostage-taking bank robber or Islamic radical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political correctness&#8221;  &mdash;  which is basically a low-grade Stockholm syndrome playing out on a broad societal stage  &mdash;  is actually a subtle form of brainwashing. Even establishment mouthpiece Newsweek, in its famous Dec. 24, 1990, cover story on the then-new phenomenon of political correctness on college campuses (titled &#8220;Thought Police&#8221;) conceded this truth when it reported: &#8220;PC is, strictly speaking, a totalitarian philosophy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The problem with Islam</b></p>
<p>Now imagine there&rsquo;s a religion, which we&rsquo;ll call &#8220;Religion X.&#8221; Many adherents to &#8220;Religion X&#8221; live peaceful lives in pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Whatever their religious doctrine is, they don&rsquo;t bother anybody.</p>
<p>But other adherents to Religion X believe  &mdash;  indeed, are taught by prominent clerics, including within the U.S.  &mdash;  that they must rule the world, and that the lord of their religion condones, even encourages, their killing those who refuse to convert to Religion X, or who leave Religion X.</p>
<p>So, one contingent of this religion we are inclined to allow freely to exist within our borders  &mdash;  indeed our laws and culture demand it. But virtually all Americans would rightly categorize the other contingent of the same religion as a murderous, mind-control cult that should be driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The problem with Religion X, then, is that it&rsquo;s really hard to distinguish one type of adherent from the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem we&rsquo;re having with Islam. Every time a jihadist like Hasan goes on a terrorist killing spree, invariably all who knew him say they were totally stunned, as he was always so &#8220;calm, cool and soft-spoken.&#8221; And yet there were warning signs, such that were we not blinded by our fears and cowardice, we would not merely have seen them, we would have acted on them  &mdash;  and prevented last week&rsquo;s terrorist attack.</p>
<p>According to the London Telegraph, in an article headlined, &#8220;Fort Hood gunman had told U.S. military colleagues that infidels should have their throats cut&#8221;:<blockquote> Major Nidal Malik Hasan, the gunman who killed 13 at America&rsquo;s Fort Hood military base, once gave a lecture to other doctors in which he said non-believers should be beheaded and have boiling oil poured down their throats.</p>
<p>He also told colleagues at America&rsquo;s top military hospital that non-Muslims were infidels condemned to hell who should be set on fire.<br>
</blockquote>Hasan made these incendiary jihadist comments &#8220;in front of <em>dozens of other doctors</em> at Walter Reed Army Medical Centre in Washington, D.C.&#8221; during a talk on the Quran, according to the report.</p>
<p>And how did his fellow doctors respond?</p>
<p>Although they were horrified, &#8220;One Army doctor who knew him said a fear of appearing discriminatory against a Muslim soldier had stopped fellow officers from filing formal complaints,&#8221; reported the Telegraph.</p>
<p>Are you with me? &#8220;A fear of appearing discriminatory&#8221; caused 51 brave American soldiers to be shot by an Islamist monster, 13 fatally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It gets worse, much worse. As ABC now reports, &#8220;U.S. intelligence agencies were aware <em>months ago</em> that Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan was attempting to make contact with people associated with al-Qaida.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evil of &#8220;political correctness&#8221;  &mdash;  the totalitarian manipulation of thought, foisted on us by twisted elitist sociopaths who hate America and everything our soldiers have fought and died for over the last two centuries, and continue to fight and die for  &mdash;  has to end. Now. It&rsquo;s over. This nation must rise up and defy the insane thought control that is destroying our country right before our eyes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One last point: If you really want to do something besides complain about the spread of Islamic radicalism in the United States  &mdash;  a level of infiltration already far more advanced than you can imagine  &mdash;  then make a donation to WND&rsquo;s legal defense fund. We are defending, at great expense, two people who most definitely are not intimidated by Islamic radicalism: &#8220;Muslim Mafia&#8221; co-author and former federal agent Paul David Gaubatz and his son Chris Gaubatz, who daringly penetrated the belly of the Islamist beast in the U.S. for six months, retrieved 12,000 pages of smoking-gun documentary evidence, reported their findings in the blockbuster book (already the basis for new congressional investigations)  &mdash;  and are now being sued by a terror-front group that wants the evidence of its plots and misdeeds returned! We have hired the best First Amendment lawyer in the country, and we can and must win this all-important fight, but it&rsquo;s expensive  &mdash;  so please help. OK?<br>

		<p>Nonsense.  The reason we don&rsquo;t mention the Islamic status of criminals is the same that we don&rsquo;t mention their race: Doing so highlights the fundamental danger of the MultiCult, which is itself the end-goal of the ruling class&rsquo;s foreign and domestic policies.</p>

		<p>I think the establishment fears &#8220;anti-Muslim bigotry,&#8221; even though fundamentalist Islam (i.e. most of it) contradicts the politically correct gender and sexual orientation values of the American establishment, because the American establishment doesn&rsquo;t want to tolerate any legitimate expression of what a philosopher that Martin Luther King (or whoever wrote it for him) quoted in the Letter from the Birmingham Jail, the &#8220;i-it&#8221; relationship, or rather, a fancier way of bemoaning the &#8220;fascism&#8221; of an us-versus-them mentality.  </p>

		<p>I think WorldNetDaily is completely off in their conclusions.  It&rsquo;s not political correctness nor is it a form of Stockholm Syndrome.  The people who defend Islam believe in certain conspiracy theories about a another religious minority in this country and view muslims as allies in the worldwide struggle to throw them off.  I&rsquo;m surprised so many unawakened intelligent people have their heads in the clouds and can&rsquo;t see it.  It also explains why an increasing number of ordinary White Americans are joining the Taliban, Al Qeada, etc. to fight against their own nation.    </p>

		<p>I will remind Americans that you bombed Serbia because the Serbs did not want to accept Islam, did you ever ask yourselves why they were fighting the muslims?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple, because they learned over hundreds of years what Islam really is.</p>
<p>If you Americans would study Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian literature, you will seen that most of it is anti Islam.</p>
<p>Now your lessons about Islam is beginning, how much time will you need to learn?</p>
<p>Eastern Europe&rsquo;s history would teach you faster and without risking your children&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>I doubt that you will ever learn, watching tv is easier and you don&rsquo;t have to think.</p>
<p>Another way to learn is to try to undestand what is going on in UK, a country advancing fast to sharia law.</p>
<p>Have you heard about BNP? They can teach you too.<br>

		<p>Makes sense&hellip;the Doctors are afraid of having their careers ended by being branded or worse &#8220;charged&#8221; with being racist.  It is the same at work places all over America.  No one can express an honest appraisal of someone without suffering consquences.  Freedom of speach stifled.  The military should not be subject to the same restraints as civilian life because the military has a unique social hierarchy and mission.  The military should be able, indeed must be able, to discriminate in order to be able to function effectively.  Of course a military that puts young men and woman together on aircraft carriers and then wonders why there are pregnant sailors might be hopeless.</p>

		<p> How true, how true! The beast is within the tent   &mdash;   OUR tent   &mdash;   but the powers that be continue to deny that there is any such thing as a beast. What these bombers, shooters and other homicidal Muslims are practicing is not a PERVERSION of Muslim. It is the logical conclusion of the teachings of Mohammed and his Koran.</p>

		<p>WE as in Americans are not afraid of Islam, we are afraid of our own government throwing US into prison with unfair hate crimes and politically correct (to everyone but whites anyway) legislation.</p>
<p>The politicians are afraid of the progressive left who scream racism at the drop of a hat therefore WE pay the price.</p>
<p>Remove the liberal, progressive lefties like Feminist and their allied voting block minorities and we would push Islam back to the sands where it belongs.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The evil of &lsquo;political correctness&rsquo; &mdash; the totalitarian manipulation of thought, foisted on us by twisted elitist sociopaths who hate America and everything our soldiers have fought and died for over the last two centuries, and continue to fight and die for &mdash; has to end. Now. It&rsquo;s over. This nation must rise up and defy the insane thought control that is destroying our country right before our eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about this article is that its author, Mr. Kupelian, seems as conflicted as the ideologies and people he is himself criticizing. In part, I would hold that this is because he is basically a sound and logical man, who just cannot bring himself to review the totalitarian manipulations of  &ldquo;political correctness,&rdquo; and its transformation into the mindlessly enforced state &ldquo;religion&rdquo; of multiculturalism. And it is because of this, that while he is hitting certain points right on the head, this editorial of his seems so very frustrated.</p>
<p>Look, the differences are somewhat subtle, like the differences between Leninism and Stalinism; they all basically boil down to the foundations of an intended sociopolitical-architectural structure, and then the final edifice that realistically concludes such a building project. For example and clarification, I may want to build a freestanding inverted pyramid, but eventually I will have to accept the fact that four strong pillars will have to buttress it on its corners, or else it will simply collapse. </p>
<p>When Mr. Kupelian delves into the issues of fear and the subsequent &ldquo;low-grade Stockholm syndrome&rdquo; that political correctness produces in the face of Islamic terrorism, he is unwittingly holding that the pillars of that foundation&rsquo;s goals are not required. He has, perhaps even despite his own logic, doubleplus-thought that while they are there, that they are not really required. Thus, he misses the entire point of the multiculturalism that he unwittingly accepts as &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; and just how it now has superseded political correctness. In short, by not admitting that the racial conflicts and anti-white dogmas of the former exist, he has not grasped the latter religion of phantasmal Western-Armageddon worship that it has become. After all, when genocide of the white race is the goal, the only real rationality conflict (or to use a fancy term, cognitive dissonance) is in seeing how one&rsquo;s own: self, family, or socioeconomic class, is to be spared it. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

MSNBC was quick to copy/paste the Souther Poverty Lie Centers press kit on Mr. Hasan. Apparently, Mr. Hasan IS a terrorist IF you define terrorist to include white supremacists:</p>

<p>The SPLC is being hypocritical when it worries about the (scant few) right-wing &#8220;lone wolf&#8221; terrorists.  The SPLC is precisely the reason why some people think they have to resort to &#8220;lone wolfism&#8221; instead of organized activity in that stead.  If any organization like that appears, the SPLC jumps all over them like ducks on a june bug with lawsuits, and sues them out of existence.  Therefore, in order to avoid too much scrutiny, they have to go &#8220;lone wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who worries about &#8220;right wing domestic terrorism,&#8221; other than the fact that you&rsquo;re being paranoid mostly, better that you should see &#8220;right wing domestic terrorists&#8221; (the ones that aren&rsquo;t FBI provocateurs) out in the open, rather than them hiding in cubby holes.  That was an unintended consequence of Morris Dees&rsquo;s business model.</p>

		<p>I am not so sure that this country has become as &#8220;fearful&#8221; or &#8220;intimidated&#8221; by muslims as it has become as fearful and intimidated by liberal/ leftwing trouble makers. Look at college campuses around this country, it is the liberal/leftwingers who run things and are doing the intimidating without any opposition. The Islamists on campus have just become their fellow travellers in stomping out any opposition to them. This is why I always state that if we are to win a war against the muslim jihadists, we first need to win the war against the liberal/ leftwingers who try an hamstring, through their doctrine of &#8220;political correctness&#8221;, any attempt to deal with these muslim nutcases with the ruthlessness that is needed to win. If &#8220;political correctness&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t work, then the liberal/leftwing will then resort to even more strident intimidation which is usually violent confrontation. The problem with the liberal/leftwingers is that it hasn&rsquo;t donned on them that they are just the useful idiots of muslims this time. It&rsquo;s ironic, because it&rsquo;s usually the liberal/leftwing that likes to use &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; to achieve their goals. If the liberal/leftwing/muslim alliance prevails, I have no doubt the leftwingers who have helped them achieve their goals will now feel the wrath of their muslim allies. Because leftwingers are,afterall, worse then &#8220;infidels&#8221;, they are &#8220;godless infidels&#8221;.</p>

<p>Hasan was mimicking Mir Aimal Kasi, a Muslim who shot up employees at C.I.A. headquarters in January 1993 (two were killed, three were wounded).  Kasi was captured in Pakistan by the F.B.I. in 1997 and was executed by lethal injection in 2002.</p>
<p>Hasan already knows his fate will be the same. He rationally sought martyrdom in the name of his people, and he will get it. He will die a soldier for Islam and for his people.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with what you say about the criminal NATO bombings of the Serbs.  Serbs were fighting hardened islamic fighters from the ranks of Osama Bin Ladin.  If anything we should have been helping the Serbs, but I have given up on the US or its&rsquo; allies ever being on the right side of a conflict ever again.  Liberalism makes enemies of your friends, see Serbia, who was on our side of WW2, while empowering our enemies.</p>

<p>It was the boy President, Bill Clinton who ordered that.  According to Gail Sheehy, who wrote a flattering biography of Hillary Clinton, it was Hillary who pushed him to do it.  The Serbs were doing some nasty things, but so were the people they were fighting.  People do ugly things in war, on both sides.  We should have stayed out of that feud, it had nothing to do with us.</p>

<p>The average American knows very well about Islam as our nation has been the number one target of extremists for years and we have been attacked both here and abroad quite a bit in the past couple of decades. Of course the politically correct news media tries its&rsquo; best to cover it up but the average person knows. It&rsquo;s the politically correct elite in America, Europe and the UN that wanted Serbia bombed, not the average American/European.</p>

<p>What you wrote is completly true. Unfortunately, It may be the case that many of the people who post here  may have supported the bombing of the Christian Serbs. They believed every single Clinton lie about Serbian atrocities. All the Clinton lies have been exposed eleven years after their mass murder of Serbians Christians. </p>
<p>Hilarly Clinton is the one who egged on Bill to bomb the Serbian Christian population for 77 days. Hilarly Clinton is a mass murderer.</p>

		<p>He right!  <br>
The problem is too much <b>cowardice </b> by the public in the fearful face of Islam and the resultant Stockholm syndrome which makes most people so willingly go along with any political correctness that shields them from reality, esp. the reality of their cowardice.</p>
<p>He might have added that this cowardice is the reason so many never make any effort to learn about Islam. Korans are cheap but too few will bother to buy and read the horrific stuff they are afraid they will find. </p>
<p>He might have added that even most Muslims are afraid to face the ugly reality of their 7th century desert religion. Subconsciously many sense that Muhammad was just a self-serving fraud who became powerful by spreading the loot from raids around and by having his critics assassinated, and this is why Muslims get so hysterical when their prophet is in any way ridiculed - as by cartoons. They don&rsquo;t want to face the truth either. Expert ex-Muslims like Ali Sina of faithfreedom.org will tell you that the way to fight Islam is by giving it the ridicule it deserves. Respecting Islam only entrenches the Muslim&rsquo;s militant mindlessness demanded by their Koran and historically militant culture.</p>

<p>&#8220;will remind Americans that you bombed Serbia because the Serbs did not want to accept Islam&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer is very simple, because they learned over hundreds of years what Islam really is.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are both right and wrong.</p>
<p>1. We did not bomb our WWII ally Serbia, Bill Klintoon and his nut case wife Hillary did that&hellip;without consulting the Congress or me.  I am sure you are already aware of the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;It now seems clear that the US Clinton Administration and the German Government have been actively supporting the KLA since 1992 with weapons, training, intelligence and, most importantly, significant political encouragement. The final turning point in KLA fortunes came when US special envoys Richard Holbrooke and Peter Galbraith posed in 1998 for pictures with the KLA leadership, thereby cementing the endorsement&#8221;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#8220;The US committed itself to the KLA, and therefore to trying to break off Kosovo  &mdash;  with its 20 ethnic groups, not just the Kosovar Albanians  &mdash;  into a separate state. So the thought that Dr Rugova was &#8220;a virtual prisoner&#8221; remained in the media interpretation, blessed by the Clinton White House&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as anecdotal evidence goes, my dear Son-in-law was dispatched to observe the KLA operations on the ground as a sniper/scout. He told me that once the traitor Clinton supplied the KLA with the latest night vision and thermal imaging gear, all KFOR troops were in great danger since they had previously operated with impunity at night. In addition, he told me that several US helicopters were shot down in Macedonia using the MANPADs the Clinton Defense Dept. supplied to the muslim KLA army, he and Delta operators participated in several rescue attempts.</p>
<p>The US, Britain and much of the European Union have not learned a thing from history and are not interested in learning since they think their golden parachutes and machine-gun toting bodyguards will isolate them from the violence.</p>
<p>Glad to have our caucasian European brothers on this website!</p>

		<p>The LESSON is that terrorism works. The left has been terrorizing Whites for decades while all the so-called White leaders sit on their hands and talk about getting messages out or asking for donations, while lamenting our impending doom. It it coming to the point where the left are now truly so confident that we will take it lying down that they are openly calling for our heads and laughing in our faces because they are not afraid of us. Why should they be afraid? We have shown over and over again that we won&rsquo;t fight. We constantly sit around and say what can we do, God help us.  Watching Nick Griffin grovel like a dog showed me there is not a leader out there who is willing to stand up for our people. Why should they? Our lack shows we have become a weak people who are not worthy of survival. As pitiful as the situation is in Europe, it is much worse here in America where we have NOTHING to hold on to and no hope with our two party monopoly. Just something to think about. I am getting tired of dying a little each day on my knees, and am getting tired of our so-called leaders continuing to be act like cowards. How much more are we willing to take?</p>

<p>AMEN!  Thank you for saying what needs to be said.  I am sick of people in our movement being Muslim sympathizers just because they have such a low opinion of another religious minority that will remain unmentioned ( a minority that Muslims hate).

<p>&#8220;I will remind Americans that you bombed Serbia because the Serbs did not want to accept Islam, did you ever ask yourselves why they were fighting the muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I was living in former Yugoslavia when this happened.  Allow me to clarify this broad and misleading statement a little; </p>
<p>1. Americans did not bomb Serbia, NATO did and Jack Straw of the UK government and NATO was the de facto spokesman for the missions.  US just PAYS for most of NATO.<br>
2. You must make quite a leap to turn the issue into a simple one of Serbs nor wishing to accept Islam, they certainly did during the time of Yugoslavia and Tito.  However, there is a basic long history of unease, based on 500 years of Ottoman Turkish Islamic control.  Regardless, Serbians were allowed to remain Christians all the same.<br>
3. What NATO was doing was attempting to control a man (Milosevic) and his paramilitaries who were nothing more than a political mafia, from causing the violence to spill into a greater region.  They could not sit idly by while the land of Gavrilo Princip and the Black Hand stirred up the elements that led to the First World War.<br>
(As a note, I knew many Bosnian Serbs who were victimized by Milosevic&rsquo;s paramilitaries.  They broke into and ransacked their homes and stole every portable object of value. And they did not only rape Bosnian Muslims.  I heard several terrible personal stories.  These same thugs were behind the then rising and current use of Ukrainian and Russian sex slaves in the Balkans and Turkey).<br>
4. Milosevic and his government arrogantly taunted the rest of Europe and the world, just asking for a response.  No attempt was made to make an intellectual case against the expansion of Albania into Kosovo or even the basic problem that Al Queda had a cell in Sarajevo.  If Serbia had tried even a little, to make a case, the history of Serbia in the 1990s might be very different.  <br>
5, Milosevic was an obvious deviant with psychological/mental problems.  He was medeival, to be generous, and could only imagine helping his country through medeival methods of population extermination.  Hitler was the same.  It is outlandish to imagine that ANY government with its history related to the European experience could sit by in the late 20th century and allow such barbarity under their nose.</p>
<p>I was in Slovenia at the time.  Milosevic threatened to invade Croatia and Slovenia as the next phase once he finished cleansing Kosovo and Bosnia/Herzegovina.  He said that he was going to take revenge on Slovenia for allowing NATO to use their air space.  Milosevic had already sent the Yugo air force to bomb Croatia and Slovenia when they initally broke away in 1991 and there was a two week war.  Milosevic had declared later during the later 1990s that the reunited Yugoslavia he planned for would do away with all languages except Serbian.  Slovenians are very proud of their own language and culture.  They would never stand for this, I am more than certain.  Austria has ties to Slovenia, Russia has ties to both, but more to Serbia.  Russian soldiers were already independently hopping onto trains and planes and going to Kosovo to support Serbia during the Kosovo crisis.  There were a couple days that we thought that an official Russian military response was eminent.  It almost happened.</p>
<p>This is why NATO had no choice other than to stop Milosevic and Serbia.  Later, Serbian youth rose up and forced Milosevic&rsquo;s resignation.  I don&rsquo;t blame Serbs for being proud, I have Serb friends that I support in retaining their country and identity.  But it is a tightrope that we all must walk, and in those times, Serbia was anything but righteous.  But they could have been - and that is the tragedy.</p>

From every last one of our political and military elites? It&rsquo;s not about Islam! It&rsquo;s not about Islam!! It&rsquo;s not about Islam!!! Sharia has been established as the law of our land.

		<p>Actually Islam is not a religion, it is a terrorist organization. It always has been and it is now. Islam committed the biggest terrorist act in the history of the world on 9/11. Days, weeks, months and years of Video, newspaper coverage, radio, and TV coverage, and people are still unaware that Islam is nothing more than a terrorist organization. The beheading of Daniel Pearl, and others, some videotaped for the world to see, the bombing of trains, the bombing of civilian establishments with hundreds of innocent people in them, the public murder of Van Gogh and others and the continuing threat by the Islamic leaders to kill all non believers still in not enough to convince those who live in La La Land that Islam is not a religon but a terrorist organization.

		<p>The Serbs had their reasons for fighting Bosnian Muslims, to be sure. Bosnian Muslims collaborated with the Nazis in World War II against the Allies. The Serbians allied with the Russians, of course.</p>
<p>Remember those photos of Bosnian Muslims being held prisoner by Serbs, in those  camps, surrounded by barbed wire? That&rsquo;s that pushed Clinton over the edge. To many Americans, it somehow evoked images of the Nazi death camps in Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald and elsewhere. They thought that if the Serbs weren&rsquo;t stopped, it would be just like Nazi Germany with the death camps all over again. </p>

This is why most major newspapers have circulations that are dropping like a rock or cable news shows like MSNBC can barely muster 10 viewers on any day of the week.  Half the country gets it while people like you are busy spinning wild imaginative stories about how they are all suffering from some kind of mental illness.  You then feed this tripe to the other half as a mask to prevent any kind of critical thinking into why these people support muslims.

<p>There is a point in the history of society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that among other things it sides even with those who harm it, criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly. Punishing somehow seems unfair to it, and it is certain that imagining &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; and being &ldquo;supposed to punish&rdquo; hurts it, arouses fear in it. &ldquo;Is it not enough to render him undangerous? Why still punish? Punishing itself is terrible.&rdquo; With this question, herd mentality, the morality of timidity, draws its ultimate consequence.<br>

		<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the problem we&rsquo;re having with Islam. Every time a jihadist like Hasan goes on a terrorist killing spree, invariably all who knew him say they were totally stunned, as he was always so &ldquo;calm, cool and soft-spoken.&rdquo; &#8220;<br>
So by this reasoning, ALL adherents to islam are potential time bombs waiting to go off, and, in the name of common-sense security, should be dealt with accordingly.</p>
