<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-11-24-621870076_x.htm">Britain Says World Cup Fans at Risk of Carjacking</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>USA Today, November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British government has warned that fans arriving in South Africa for next year&rsquo;s World Cup could be at risk of carjacking when they leave Johannesburg airport.</p>
<p>The planned high-speed Gautrain rail link from the airport to Pretoria has already been curtailed and may now not be ready in time for the start of the monthlong tournament on June 11.</p>
<p>That will leave most fans hiring cars or taking taxis, and the government&rsquo;s foreign office says they should be on guard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government is urging fans to purchase comprehensive travel insurance before heading to the World Cup and to book car hire ahead of time to cut the chances of being targeted.<br>

		<p>It makes little difference to the Main Stream Media whether there are hijackings or murders of soccer fams, the policies are already set by the New York Times that no reports of crime or<br>
negative reports of South Africa will be published in any of our Newspapers or magazines. There could be a blood bath of tourists<br>
and Time Magazine will only publish the soccer scores.</p>

		<p>As someone who escapd SA in 1999, 5 years after the new terrorist government took power, I can vouch that SA is a very dangerous place to live and visit.  It is the usual marxist situation where te black masses who were promised house jobs and cars etc, except for te Party faithful, all are very disappointed that unemployment even without the crisis is very high, and people live in gated communities to keep out the violent criminals who attackhomes, force residents to fill up their own cars with their personal gods, usually raping the wife and daughters in front of the male members of the families before driving off into the sunset in the stolen cars.</p>
<p>It would be poetic justice if leading anti-Apartheid campaigners came to SA an were rapd and robbed, ignoring the warnings in the hotels about not walking the streets, shopping, without a supplied (at your cost) guard dressed in a yellow plastic smock.</p>
<p>Well it has happened at last in this litigious society where UK Govt. officials have been on national TV to warn thsoe who are planning to go to the soccer World Cup next year to be extremely cautious.  ravle agents will have to impress on potentail visitors, even get them to sign a form that where they are going is not the usul welcoming football paradise to prevent tlawsuits when loved ones do not return except in a pine box, or in a whel chair if they are lucky.<br>
Even diplomats have been followd from the Johannesburg International Airport, now renamed after one of the African National Congress founder members, O R Tambo, for the forms that are expected to be filled out while on the incoming flight for customs where the visitor is asked how much cash he/she has on them, and other valuable personal belongings, is passsed to criminals at the airport so they know who to attack and rob.</p>
<p>Only those who have lived there can believe what can and does happen all as forecast by the white South Africans those few short years ago.  We escaped in 1999 fed up with friends being robbed raped and killed and the new government doing little to stop it for they want all whites to leave &#8220;their continent&#8221; despite the historical fact that it will mean the quick degradaton of their security and lives, and then when the global warming cased by solar activity as we are finding out now and I worked out four years ago, occurs, the African begging bowls will be held out for yet more aid to rescue them from their self-inflicted misery.</p>
<p>But despite the eviction of African whites, many African blacks want to move to the West as their burgeoning populations grow beyond their abilities to feed themselves.</p>

		<p>I have lived in several parts of the world and know the level of obsession that many countries have with their national soccer teams. However, if I really wanted to watch world cup soccer, I would purchase the pay per view (or whatever it is called in Europe, Asia, etc) and avoid the real potential for violence that is sure to occur when the cup is held in SA.  </p>

		<p>The potential for violence is real, no question about that. But what those potential tourists need to understand is that, even if they are lucky enough not to be attacked, there is going to be chaos - guaranteed. Driving to or from any airport on any normal weekday is not for the faint-hearted. During the World Cup I can guarantee there will be chaos on the roads.</p>
<p>The article states that their showpiece &#8220;Gautrain&#8221; will not be ready in time.  That&rsquo;s not the only thing that won&rsquo;t be ready on time. Look for roadworks still under construction, inadequate signage, and above all the &#8220;kaffir-taxis&#8221;.  These are minibus taxis that are the backbone of South Africa&rsquo;s transport system.  With seats for 16 very skinny people, they recognise no limitations on capacity or driving. They are completely undisciplined, and occasionally open fire on rival taxis. Their favourite tactic for extorting concessions from the government is the &#8220;rolling blockade&#8221;.  Dozens of taxis block all lanes on a highway, then slow down to a walking pace.</p>
<p>With hundreds of thousands of tourists on the roads, the government will be over a barrel. I can&rsquo;t believe that the taxi operators won&rsquo;t take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t believe that the promised broadcast capacity for the games will be ready in time, either.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t, now.</p>
<p>Trust me, you don&rsquo;t want to be in South Africa when this lot hits the fan.  I plan to be elsewhere.</p>

Any sane man would call this assertion by Analog man as ridiculous. Of course any sane man would never have flown to Rio, much less gotten in a cab as I did in 1987. I always wondered if I was charged the extra mileage it took to continue to brandish a weapon and try to get a shot off as we sped past and beyond my hotel. That would really irritate me. It`s not my fault that we couldn`t get a clean shot off and I shouldn`t have to have paid for that, should I ?!? </p>

<p>Right, don&rsquo;t worry so much about your car being hijacked as your life being hijacked. YOU being killed, not merely your car being taken from you.</p>
<p>I would think they need some sort of thing like in Jamaica for the soccer [football] tourists. Special hostels and hotels and such where you are taken to your residence by bus from the airport direct - - the residence being surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence and guarded, and you being told to stay indoors and not to go outside other than be in the stands for a game.</p>
<p>Other than being a spectator at a venue, do not wander from your residence.</p>

		<p>Tim McHugh @ 12:54:  Sanity is not a factor in South Africa. Although, mind you, for the taxi operators it&rsquo;s the most rational thing in the world to shoot your business competitors. Rival taxi operators, buses, all fair game - and their passengers, too.  A friend of mine was shot at, and her 17-year-old son killed, by the driver of one of these taxis.  Just for fun.  He did the same to several other motorists, and was never caught.</p>
<p>Jedderman makes a very salient point that is not obvious in the article, namely, that SA carjackers very often - I would almost say, normally - kill the drivers of the cars they steal. I no longer watch TV or read newspapers in this country, so I don&rsquo;t know whether this is still the case. Trendy Johannesburg housewives used to attend training courses to learn the proper etiquette for being hijacked - where to put your hands, avoid eye contact, how to hand over your keys - to avoid being killed.</p>
<p>It really infuriates me when I hear people saying how lucky they are to have been hijacked, but not killed.  This is what South Africa has come to.  And incidentally, Jedderman, what you describe as the Jamaican solution:  that&rsquo;s the way we normally live here.  Residences surrounded by high walls topped with razor wire or electric fences, and staying home at night. And still people&rsquo;s homes are invaded and they are robbed, raped, tortured and killed.  Just another normal day in the Rainbow Nation.</p>

		<p>I occasionally see posts on the various Internet message boards from South Africans, the most productive people in all of Africa. How sad to know that their eventual fate at best will be to be forced out of their own country! Already the country has sunk into a kind of barbarism unknown in the civilized world, while the MSM pretends not to notice. Sad, sad, and all so predictable and avoidable.</p>
