<h1>Some Lawmakers Send Few to Academies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Witte, Yahoo! News, November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the nation&rsquo;s military academies try to recruit more minorities, they aren&rsquo;t getting much help from members of Congress from big-city districts with large numbers of blacks, Hispanics and Asians.</p>
<p>From New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, lawmakers from heavily minority areas rank at or near the bottom in the number of students they have nominated for appointment to West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy or the U.S. Air Force Academy, according to an Associated Press review of records from the past five years.</p>
<p>High school students applying to the academies must be nominated by a member of Congress or another high-ranking federal official. Congressional nominations account for about 75 percent of all students at the academies.</p>
<p>Academy records obtained by the AP through the Freedom of Information Act show that lawmakers in roughly half of the 435 House districts nominated more than 100 students each during the five-year period.</p>
<p>But Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York City, chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, nominated only four students, the lowest among House members who served the entire five-year period. Rep. Charles Rangel, whose New York City district includes Harlem, was second-lowest, with eight nominations. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose San Francisco district is 29 percent Asian, was also near the bottom, with 19.</p>
<p>In fact, the bottom 20 House members were all from districts where whites make up less than a majority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He noted what an academy appointment means: a free four-year education and a guaranteed job as an officer for at least five years after graduation.</p>
<p>Velazquez, Rangel and Pelosi would not comment or did not return calls.</p>
<p>Academy leaders and some on Capitol Hill do not put all the blame on the politicians, pointing out that some districts might have a shortage of qualified candidates, either because students have not gotten the necessary academic preparation from their struggling schools, they are unaware of the opportunity, or they are uninterested.</p>
<p>But while the burden is ultimately on students to apply, academy leaders and others said elected officials should be doing more to publicize the opportunity by doing such things as visiting schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Maxine Waters, whose district includes heavily Hispanic and black south Los Angeles and who is among the 20 lowest in nominations, said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have made young people in her district question military service. She said her efforts to reach out to high school students have not been very successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the olden days, parents would even say to young African-Americans, &#8216;You aren&rsquo;t doing anything. You don&rsquo;t have a job. Why don&rsquo;t you join the service?&rsquo;&#8221; said Waters, who has nominated 14 students in the past five years. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t quite do that anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Academy leaders have struggled to make the racial makeup of the military&rsquo;s officer corps more closely resemble that of its enlisted ranks. The disparity is greatest in the Navy, with minorities making up about 48 percent of the enlisted ranks and just 21 percent of the officer corps.</p>
<p>The academies can cite some recent progress. The freshman class of 1,230 at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., includes 435 students who are black, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American or part of another minority group. That is about 35 percent, up from 28 percent the year before.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., there are 330 minorities in the freshman class of about 1,300, or about 25 percent, up from 22 percent in 2008. The freshman class of 1,376 at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., includes 312 minorities, or 23 percent, also a slight increase from the previous class.</p>
<p>House members are limited to nominating students in their districts. Lawmakers can have five students from their districts at each academy at a time, and they can nominate up to 10 students for each vacant seat. That makes it possible to nominate up to 150 students for 15 seats over four years, if all of the seats are vacant.</p>
<p>The bottom 20 members of Congress include Rep. Bobby Rush of Chicago, an Army veteran who has nominated just 12 students in five years. Sharon Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Rush, said that he wants to raise awareness in his inner-city district but that people rarely apply for nominations.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons is that black and Hispanic legislators are relatively lazy.  In the 1970s and early 80s in St. Louis, Bill Clay Sr., the Congressman from the black part of St. Louis City and County, did nothing when his elderly constituents came to him to help them find their lost social security checks.  The white fairly conservative Democrat from a neighboring district, Bob Young, did all that work, even though those weren&rsquo;t his voters.</p>
<p>And how did the Democrat Party reward Young?  By signing off on gerrymandering his district to a heavily Republican part of St. Louis and St. Charles County in 1980&rsquo;s redistricting, when MO lost a seat, in order to keep Bill Clay Sr. safe.</p>
<p>You can only get a military academy nomination from the Congress(wo)man in the district where you live.  And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t complain.  There are far too many minorities in the academies as it is.  What about their drop out rate?  Would be interseted to see that, but Uncle Sucker won&rsquo;t publish that.</p>

<p>1) It&rsquo;s a damned shame that White men will continue to die in disproportionate numbers for a country whose government hates them.</p>
<p>2) As for the military academies paucity of Africans?  Good. </p>

<p>In my opinion this is a deliberate malicious effort! These minority congress men and women hate the U.S., hate the U.S. military, see it as a pernicious force, and don&rsquo;t want what they perceive as &#8220;their&#8221; youth being used as cannon fodder for a nation they hate. These minority congressmen and women are deliberatly not filling &#8220;slots&#8221; in an evil way. Very sad. And it is NOT FOR lack of eligible students either!!</p>

<p>I hate to see Whites both in the U.S. Army and the British Army being used as cannon fodder for wars fought for globalists and big corporations both of whom hate White people. But I did rather have a lot of White people inside the U.S. and British military. Would you want a lot of non-Whites in control of all those advanced weapons (invented by White scientists and engineers) even if non-Whites (except East Asians and especially blacks) would make incompetent soldiers?<br>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s not too tough to figure out. The service academies dish out much more hard discipline and academeic rigor than most blacks care to subject themselves to, not to mention the  time commitment. I&rsquo;m sure the socialist congresscritters would love to pack the academies with ghetto dwellers, but no one will carry them there, they actually have to work, and work hard. </p>

		<p>I dont understand why institutions have to go out and actively seek minorities.  There are enough equality laws in place to ensure everyone is paid and treated the same, with the same opportunities available to all. Cant they just let people make up their own minds, rather than obsessing with having percentages that reflect society?   Maybe there are fewer minorities going to military academy, because those minorities dont WANT to go to military academy. </p>

		<p>To poster nubmer 1.  You are only partially correct.  Nominations can be earned from Congressman in your district, one of your state Senators, the Secretary of your respective military of interest, i.e., the Secretary of the Navy for USNA appointments, Presidential, Vice Presidential, and of course, in the rare occasion, a Medal of Honor winner.  There are requirements for all of those that must be met and sometimes require military service on the part of family members.</p>
<p>Question to any and all: What are the opinions regarding the treatment of Black soldiers, sailors and marines returing from WWI and WWII, and Korea to a country that contiued to treat Blacks as, at best, second class citizens? </p>

		<p>The service academies could easily fill their ranks with qualified white males and still have plenty that would make good officers. While there are minorities (and some whites) who fail out, many are &#8220;socially promoted&#8221; through the Air Force, Naval, and Military Academies. The Coast Guard Academy accepts students on MERIT alone. In reality, a number of these students couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to those who graduated from the military academies in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>In a lot of these &#8220;minority-majority&#8221; districts, there really aren&rsquo;t a lot of qualified students. Those who could succeed, are generally given everything but the kitchen sink by civilian colleges who need to raise their minority numbers. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, once these unqualified people graduate from the academy, they matriculate to a leadership specific school. I&rsquo;m not sure what the Army and Air Force equivalents are, but those who graduate at the bottom of their Naval Academy class tend to end up in &#8220;Surface Warfare&#8221;. Think a number of newly minted Ensigns who are all competing for &#8220;face time&#8221; to earn their pin and continue on the to next level. It is a version of a cage match. Some survive, a number of others complete their required time and quietly exit the service.<br>
However, the Navy can&rsquo;t dump all of their AA graduate officers into this community. Some are assigned to prestigious schools such as flight and nuclear power.It is sad to see utterly unqualified people show up at the Nuclear Power School only to have their heads handed to them a couple of months into the program. </p>
<p>We all laugh at Homer Simpson and his time at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but do you really want unqualified people handling nuclear material? </p>

<p>Is this question germane to the topic? Of course not.</p>
<p>But let me answer the question as I see it. Whatever was the nature of how persons color were treated in 1945 has NOTHING to do at all with &#8220;minority&#8221; Congressmen and women NOT filling their Congressional appointments. What occurred sixty years ago or more should not in any way inhibit the selection process now. I fear that the emotional response these Congressmen and women have toward the topic of &#8220;minority&#8221; military service overrides their rationality!! Everyone undestands if there were isolated instance of Congressmen and women not making appointments, that is the nature of things. But there is a clear and consistent pattern here that is malicious.<br>

		<p>Deets - Prior to the Korean conflict there were no blacks assigned to combat duties in any of our foreign wars.  They served strictly in support roles, though as in all modern wars some were doubtless killed fulfilling these duties.</p>
<p>How they were treated on their return to this country was simply typical and varied and largely a function of where they called home.</p>

		<p>The reason you see limited blacks in the service acads is that they will not be given the easy classes, the test answers and ho money so that they can wind up in the NBA/NFL.  Since I graduated from &#8220;The High School on the Hudson&#8221; in 1979, the learning environment requires something that is genetically missing from blacks&hellip;the ability to operate and learn in a team environment.  Military scenarios in class that require extensive planning for 2nd and 3rd order effects plus contingency planning makes them wet themselves and request to leave.  I&rsquo;ve seen it!! Some&hellip;very few, have sneaked by the gauntlet but somehow earn commissions through ROTC or OCS.  Usually they gets grades barely good enough to qualify for logistics or quartermaster corps.  Those that do get combat arms branches survive to captain and then get sent to staff jobs for the rest of their careers.  No line unit wants them and thank GOD I&rsquo;m in aviation as a helicopter pilot!  In aviation we have&hellip;maybe less than 1% in the enlisted ranks, a handful as warrant officers and I can count the number of commissioned aviators in the Army just using my hands and feet as a counter.  They are as a race, unable to understand instrument flight and get scared under night vision systems.  Some do try and do actually graduate but they volunteer for out-of-cockpit jobs ASAP.  In essence, Congressional nominations to the acads are a total waste of the nomination.</p>
