			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wright, Daily Mail (London), November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Officers have been advised to use the phrase &#8216;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; when describing sex attacks</p>
<p>Politically correct Scotland Yard chiefs have stopped using the term &#8216;gang rape&rsquo; because it is too &#8216;emotive&rsquo;, the Mail can reveal.</p>
<p>Instead officers have been advised to use the long-winded phrase &#8216;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; when describing sex attacks involving three or more culprits.</p>
<p>Critics branded the move by the Metropolitan Police an &#8216;affront&rsquo; to the victims of appalling sex crimes and are preparing to launch a campaign on the issue.</p>
<p>Six years ago the Met was at the centre of a similar row over its choice of language to describe &#8216;gang rapes&rsquo; after a senior officer referred to them as &#8216;group rapes&rsquo; during an interview on BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme.</p>
<p>Some community activists had previously suggested the phrase &#8216;gang rape&rsquo; had racist connotations.</p>
<p>Details of the latest police terminology are contained in an official Scotland Yard report which reveals a sharp increase in the number of gang rapes in the capital.</p>
<p>New figures revealed there were 93 gang sex attacks in the financial year 2008-9, compared with 71 in 2003-2004.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the age of victims has fallen with 64% aged 19 or younger in the last financial year compared with 48% in 1998-9.</p>
<p>Detective Chief Inspector Mark Yexley admits in his report on &#8216;Multi-Perpetrator Rape and Youth Violence&rsquo; for the Metropolitan Police Authority that the &#8216;common parlance for this offence is &#8216;gang&rsquo; rape&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But he adds: &#8216;This is an emotive term  &mdash;  but it is used widely in the public domain. There have been instances in the past where the term &#8216;gang&rsquo; has come to mean different things  &mdash;  either groups known to each other, criminal networks or peer groups.</p>
<p>&#8216;Care has been taken with the definition of the term &#8216;gang&rsquo; in this paper. It is however accepted that there is a public perception/understanding of what this term means.</p>
<p>Recent academic studies have suggested that the term &#8216;Multiple Perpetrator Rape&rsquo; should be used as the overarching term for offences involving two or more perpetrators.</p>
<p>&#8216;When examining rapes committed by multiple perpetrators, it should be noted that the number of offenders involved and the methods used by assailants, vary. Analysis on such offending is primarily based on victim testimony and any other supporting evidence, so links to &#8216;gangs&rsquo; cannot necessarily be established.</p>
<p>&#8216;These offences are complex in nature, ranging from allegations of consensual sex between the victims and a known party followed by non-consensual assaults committed by associates, to stranger attacks involving large groups.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chrissie Maher, founder of Plain English Campaign, told the Mail: &#8216;I am disgusted to my very bones and weep for the victims of gang rape.  I don&rsquo;t usually approve of &#8216;four-letter words&rsquo; but there is no better way of defining gang rape.  Ask the public if they need an academic study to work that out.</p>
<p>&#8216;Jargon has been used to hide and confuse all sorts of things, that&rsquo;s why Plain English Campaign was started.  But using jargon clean up crime is the last thing I ever expected to see.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ask any victim  &mdash;  rape is an emotive crime  &mdash;  it deserves an emotive term not some sterile, politically correct nonsense.  This doesn&rsquo;t deserve a Golden Bull award  &mdash;  this deserves a new campaign to give victims the respect they deserve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There have been a series of high-profile convictions of teenagers for gang rapes in the capital over the past year.</p>
<p>Two men who assaulted a girl aged 16 and doused her in caustic soda, disfiguring her for life, had their sentences increased on appeal.</p>
<p>In another case a 14-year-old girl was repeatedly raped &#8220;as punishment&#8221; by nine members of a Hackney gang because she had &#8220;insulted&#8221; their leader.</p>
<p>A meeting of the MPA, the Met&rsquo;s board of governors, heard levels of gang rape are linked to overall youth violence.</p>
<p>MPA member Jennette Arnold said some offenders are from cultural backgrounds where rape is more common. She said the crime is seen by some as a &#8220;weapon of war&#8221; and more work needs to be done to get into the minds of culprits.</p>
<p>Mrs Arnold said: &#8216;It has got to be regretted that the increase in black victims has doubled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commander Simon Foy, who leads the Met&rsquo;s homicide and serious crime command, said there is no doubt the &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; crime of &#8216;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; is under-reported.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;This is a phenomenon we are all concerned about.  There is a substantial amount of this type of offending going on which we do not necessarily know much about.</p>
<p>&#8216;The numbers we do have are relatively small. That makes it difficult to understand the trends and behaviours that are going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said the decision to use the term &#8216;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; was made by DCI Yaxley after he saw the findings of academic studies.<br>

		<p>This comes a day after the same Scotland Yard released a report showing that 92% of all individuals that participate in what used to be called &#8220;gang rapes&#8221; are non-white, though the only place where you read that was the BNP.  I suppose they did find a cracker jack solution to ending gang rape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the new term, &#8220;multi-perpetrator rape,&#8221; contains either &#8220;perpetrator&#8221; or &#8220;rape,&#8221; because of the racist connotations of those words.  The next step will be to call the act &#8220;multiple participant involuntary orifice penetration.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When whites commit crimes of this nature, it&rsquo;s &#8216;racism&rsquo;. When people of color commit these crimes, it&rsquo;s racism too, but the racism is talking about the crime. Gang rape is not a racist &#8216;term&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a racist act committed by non-whites against everyone else. The racism is the act itself. They have no problem calling it racism when whites are committing crime against people of color (I might add, even as most of these crimes work the other direction). </p>

		<p>As bad as PC is here in the U.S., Britain is worse.  Even their exellent TV shows are being lessened in quality by tokenism in the over-insertion of female, black, and gay characters in roles that could have been portrayed by anyone.  <br>
Multi-perpetrator rape, huh?  Wonder how long it will be before this phrase also becomes racist, since most such crimes are committed by non-Anglos.  One thing is certain: when the UK is finally taken over by the Islamists and Sharia law is in force, they&rsquo;re won&rsquo;t be any more PC.  Heads, hands, etc. will be lopped off in the town squares, and there&rsquo;ll be no more positive portrayals of women in authority and sexual deviants.</p>

		<p>A more descripitive and truthful way of phrasing would be, &#8220;multi-perpetrator black or immigrant youth rape&#8221;.  Got to love the Marxists who control western civilization, the gang rape isn&rsquo;t a problem, the phrasing of the offense and it&rsquo;s negative connotation to the always black or muslim perpetrators is the real problem.</p>

<p>Yes, there is - and this kind of backfired on the PC brigade. They have openly admitted what everyone has always known: that &#8216;culture&rsquo; has a lot to do with this particular crime, and that it is indeed a &#8216;weapon of war&rsquo;. It has &#8216;racist connotations&rsquo; because it is so often a racist crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has got to be regretted that the increase in black victims has doubled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And of course white victims don&rsquo;t matter. </p>

<p>Here we go again, a Top 5 list of possible future Red euphemisms for rape:</p>
<p>1.) a single rapist must be called, &ldquo;overtly and singularly sexually misdirected,&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.) two of them must be called, &ldquo;unintentionally mutual and doubly frustrated intercourse seekers;&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.) three of them must be called, &ldquo;sightless, hearingless, and speechless, in an assertively erotic triad;&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.) four of them must be called, &ldquo;immaturely romantic quadriplegics;&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.) And five of them must be called, &ldquo;the fifth elements of coital overzealousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>The biggest irritant about PCism, aside from the repulsiveness of the doctrine itself obviously, is the fetish that true believers have with multi-syllable words. I think this is a subset of their fetishization of education. When your quasi-religious worldview is built on a foundation of equality (ie, throwing nature out of the nature vs. nurture debate), then all you are left with is nurture, and education is a large subset of that. It is the only thing you have left to explain social ills. </p>
<p>(It is like they have a projection TV, and one of the three color tubes is broken. All they can do is come up with fanciful explanations as to why all the grass on TV is red and not green. Perhaps the plants outside have defective chlorophyll production due to global warming, and it is only noticeable through the sensitive lens of a television camera!)</p>
<p>This of course is why liberals play the &#8220;more educated than thou&#8221; card loudly and repeatedly, and push education as a cure-all for literally everything (apparently Jamaal cannot learn that rape is evil without first learning his multiplication tables). Perhaps if education involved the teaching of morals and ethics they would have a point, but the same liberals have long since abolished that from the schools as well.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ll use whatever term people prefer, just to get along in polite company, as long as it&rsquo;s not a multi-syllable monstrosity. &#8220;Blacks&#8221; or &#8220;africans&#8221; or &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; or &#8220;latins&#8221;? Sure, fine. Three syllables or less, great. Stick the -american on the end and it becomes ridiculous. It&rsquo;s even worse in this case, because you&rsquo;re not even insulting a race of people, you&rsquo;re describing a criminal act  &mdash;  and one of the most vicious and sadistic ones imaginable, at that. Do predatory criminal acts have rights now too?</p>

If the term gang rape is now associated with non-white gang rape it must be because it&rsquo;s observable and true.</p>
<p>Soon &lsquo;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; will acquire the same connotations and a new phrase will have to be concocted.</p>
<p>While they change the names, the behavior remains predictably consistent.</p>

		<p>I think the term multi-perpetrator rape still puts too much of the blame on the real victim of this act.  Remember, it is the racist white woman who, by refusing to service a non-white male, is committing an act of discrimination.  What is the now humiliated male to do?  The lack of respect so many whites have for other cultures in today&rsquo;s multicultural society astounds me.<br>

		<p>&#8220;There is a point in the history society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that among other things it sides even with those who harm it, criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly. Punishing somehow seems &#8220;unfair.&#8221;<br>
With this question, herd morality, the morality of timidity, draws its ultimate consequence. <br>
Whoever examines the conscience of the European today will inevitably confront this herd timidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nietzsche </p>
<p>Back then, and still - Still! - to this day, this timidity is masked as an &#8220;imperative&#8221;. <br>
An imperative that they actually refer to as &#8220;progress&#8221;!<br>
In spite of all the evidence to the contrary.<br>
If you were to present this to a Mental Health professional as an individual case, they would tell you that that individual is insane, and not only in need of help, but a detrimant to themself, and, more importantly - others!<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen are we going to continue to let the insane run our lives, and the lives of our loved ones, and children?</p>

		<p>Hey, just take it to the logical conclusion and omit the word &#8220;rape&#8221; altogether. How about a new term like &#8220;reluctant relations&#8221;?</p>
<p>Why stop there? They should even decriminalize it altogether. After all, it&rsquo;s just another step that the British people need to take in their march towards that wonderful multicultural society their political elites are constructing at breakneck speed. </p>
<p>Besides, it will free up Scotland Yard&rsquo;s time to think up new inoffensive ways to label other crimes that these silly youths seem to commit in such disproportionate numbers. </p>

		<p>Perhaps we should do away with the term &#8220;rape&#8221; altogether since it, too, has acquired a &#8220;racist&#8221; connotation.  Let&rsquo;s just use the term &#8220;enhanced dating technique.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;MPA member Jennette Arnold said: &lsquo;It has got to be regretted that the increase in black victims has doubled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Can you imagine anyone in public life bemoaning the fate of white victims?  Of course not!   Even uttering concern about the fate of whites in *any* context would be probably be deemed a hate crime.  For cultural Marxists, the fate of whites is unimportant.</p>

Yes Scotland Yard, keep pi**ing about with the terminology whilst young women and girls keep getting savagely raped.<br>
Hopefully the perps of these acts (and the bizarre activists that support them) won&rsquo;t get too offended. </p>

		<p>So here it is. One black male rapes a girl. However, he is part of a group of a dozen or so of other black males who take it in turns to rape the same girl, some more than once. This is not considered &#8216;gang&rsquo; rape as actually there were a succession of individual rapes. The correct terminology should be &#8216;group consecutive rape&rsquo;. It is interesting to note that there does not appear to be a Swahili translation of the English word &#8216;rape&rsquo;. Perhaps a survey could be undertaken amongst both female and male rape victims in the Congo, Rwanda and a host of other African countries to elicit, from their personal point of view, what suitable phrase is used by the police in their home countries to enable UK police to follow suit. This idea may be considered racist, as is &lsquo;multi-perpetrator rape&rsquo; which is obviously designed as transparent cover for &#8216;black gang&rsquo;. &#8220;&lsquo;The numbers we do have are relatively small. That makes it difficult to understand the trends and behaviours that are going on.&rsquo;&#8221;. Well, the numbers of victims may be considered &#8216;small&rsquo; but multiply each reported gang rape by the number of perpetrators and then the frequency of rape by each gang member during that attack and the number is no longer &#8216;small&rsquo;, just ask the victims, unless they are told not to &#8216;snitch&rsquo; which is another black misnomer.</p>

<p>NO, gang rape is a specific term. Multiple assailants attacking one or more victims. Many people forcing sexual practices on an unwilling victim!!!<br>
Quit, acting like you have a profound understanding of the obvious that the rest of us nonprofessionals fail to comprehend. You are a coward and couch your terms in an attempt to please your dept heads&hellip;..not complex.   </p>

		<p>None of this is happening by accident. All of our major institutions - the civil service, local and national government, the legal profession, the media, the educational establishment, the police - have been infiltrated by a sinister Marxist &#8220;change agent&#8221; called Common Purpose. (Watch Brian Gerrish&rsquo;s videos on YouTube for more information about this evil organisation.)</p>
<p>One of the principal weapons employed by Common Purpose is Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and the Orwellian perversion of language represented by such monstrosities as &#8220;multi-perpetrator rape&#8221; is a clear example of this.</p>

		<p>Well, considering that the crime of rape is committed overwhelmingly by black Africans, the term rape itself inevitably has racial connotations.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should strike the term rape (including rape oil) from the English language.</p>
<p>Perhaps &#8220;multiple instances of non-consensual sex&#8221; would be an improvement, though I suspect that everyone would still infer the race of the perpretrators.</p>

		<p>There is a linguistic observation that commonly used words and phrases tend to shorten in size over time.  Thus automobile goes to car, locomotive to train, and carbohydrates to carbs.  Aside from the obvious desire to soften the heinous act of gang rape by calling it something else, it also doesn&rsquo;t fit the linguistic model of shortening the phrase. </p>

		<p>So &#8220;gang rape&#8221; makes you think of non-white gangs, and we can&rsquo;t have that, can we?</p>
<p>The worst quote from the article:  &#8220;It has got to be regretted that the increase in black victims has doubled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereas no tears are shed for the increase in white victims.  Instead, the word &#8220;gang&#8221; must not be used to imply that non-whites are doing the raping.<br>

		<p>I disagree that PC is worse in the UK.  There were articles in major news papers a little while ago about how most gang rapists are black and most victims are white.  Can you imagine any newspaper in America printing that?  </p>
