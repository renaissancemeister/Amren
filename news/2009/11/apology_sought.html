<h1>Apology Sought After U of T Students Cause Uproar With Blackface for Halloween</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Mahoney, Globe and Mail (Toronto), November 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A University of Toronto student group is demanding public apologies from organizers of a Halloween party after participants wearing dark makeup were given a costume prize.</p>
<p>Five students, who were dressed as members of the Jamaican bobsled team and covered their faces with brown makeup, received the award from an elected student representative of one of the U of T&rsquo;s colleges.</p>
<p>The costumes and award became intensely controversial after the Torontoist blog posted a story and photo of the men. Some argue the makeup deeply offended blacks and should never have been recognized with an award. Those on the other side say the costumes were innocent and that detractors are overreacting.</p>
<p>The debate was expected to bubble over last night at a town hall meeting organized by the U of T&rsquo;s Black Students&rsquo; Association. The group says the costumes perpetuate blackface, the theatrical makeup associated with biased portrayals of blacks, and are as offensive as wearing Nazi regalia. A Facebook posting generated more than 300 comments, many of them heated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using blackface as a costume, I think it&rsquo;s wrong in any context,&#8221; said Dawn Samuel, president of the BSA. &#8220;It&rsquo;s hard because some people unwittingly do things, but at the same time you need to recognize it for what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BSA is demanding that student party organizers from three colleges  &mdash;  St. Michael&rsquo;s College, University College and Victoria University  &mdash;  publish apologies in their colleges&rsquo; newspapers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue for most people was not the students that were in the costume, but the fact that they were praised,&#8221; said Daniella Kyei, vice-president of equity for the U of T students&rsquo; union.</p>
<p>Catherine Brown, president of Victoria University&rsquo;s Student Administrative Council, said that while the three colleges organized the Oct. 29 Halloween party, only representatives from St. Michael&rsquo;s College decided to award a costume prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;We regret that this insensitive costume was documented as one of the best costumes of the night,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Officials from St. Michael&rsquo;s College Student Union did not return messages yesterday.</p>
<p>In a post on the Torontoist website last week, Deryn, the student who awarded the prize the day after the event, apologized and said he didn&rsquo;t think the costumes would cause offence. But, after reading up about blackface, he wrote that he &#8220;felt embarrassed and upset over my own ignorance in how potentially offensive something of this nature could be.&#8221; The costume award consisted of free admission to the group&rsquo;s next party, worth $5.</p>
<p>In a separate post, the students who dressed as the Jamaican Bobsled Team said they didn&rsquo;t intend to offend anyone and were trying to portray the characters in the movie, Cool Runnings, a comedy based on the Jamaican national bobsled team&rsquo;s debut at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.</p>
<p>The group consisted of four white students who wore brown makeup. One also sported a black wig. In addition, a Trinidadian student wore white makeup to portray the movie&rsquo;s coach, played by John Candy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This movie played a large part in our childhoods, and we simply wanted to express our feelings towards it with realistic costumes, which in this case included skin color,&#8221; the post says.</p>
<p>They also wrote: &#8220;Would things be different if we dressed as Barack Obama, the leader of the free world? We believe so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;<br>

		<p>Blacks move to white countries and whine about discrimination, yet there is no uproar about the displacement and extermination of whites in Zimbabwe.  How hypocritical.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Imitation is the sincerest of flattery.&#8221; <br>
 Charles Caleb Colton, Lacon, volume I, no. 183<br>
(1780 - 1832) <br>
The above quote is featured at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycpbfxk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ycpbfxk</a>, and is quite likely the most famous of all of this gentleman&rsquo;s writing to be quoted over the years.  With this in mind I find it very hard to understand the uproar over four young white men imitating the Jamaican Bobsled Team at a Halloween party.  Let&rsquo;s keep in mind the nature of the celebration in itself.  For a great number of years Halloween has been celebrated by dressing in costume.  Face paint is part of costuming, regardless of it&rsquo;s color.  To say it&rsquo;s ok to use any color but brown is a narrow-mindedness which borders on racism itself.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall any uproar over the roles played in the movie &#8216;Cool Runnings&rsquo; while it was playing in theatres.  In the real life version of the story the bobsled team returned home to Jamaica as heroes.  So what is the insult in someone dressing as these heroes for one Halloween party?  Had these four young men donned the costumes of American slave traders I could understand a racist based uproar.  I would be joining in the criticism myself.  They didn&rsquo;t however, they instead chose to flatter four real-life heroes by costuming themselves in their likeness at a social function where all attending were expected to be in costume.  Is the problem here really the costumes, or is it publicity seeking over-sensitivity?<br>

		<p>The final paragraph shows just how clueless these people are. </p>
<p>Portraying <em>any</em> black person as&hellip; well, black, is racist.</p>

		<p>Groups that are heavily invested in believing they are perennial &#8220;victims&#8221; find it impossible to laugh at themselves.  That ability is absolutely requisite for group maturity.  A group that has been persecuted for MILLENIA, not just a few hundred years, is the Jews   &mdash;   and they are past masters of being able to find humor in themselves and their situation.  I believe it&rsquo;s high time for the blacks and the American Indians to grow up and give up the victimization claim - and take responsibility for who, what and where they are.  If they don&rsquo;t, their whining is a clear message to the world that they are still immature children, and deserve to be treated as such.</p>
