<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091115/US.Immigrant.Tuition.Massachusetts/">Mass. Immigrant Tuition Bill to Get New Push</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Contreras, Comcast News, November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It seemed like a given that Mario Rodas would go to college.</p>
<p>The Guatemalan-born student certainly had the academic credentials, going from English as a second language classes to taking advanced placement exams for college credit his senior year at Chelsea High School.</p>
<p>But paying for it was another matter. As an undocumented immigrant in 2005, Rodas would have had to pay out-of-state tuition fees to go to a public college in Massachusetts, and he couldn&rsquo;t afford that. If he had lived in Texas or Utah, states that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, Rodas, now 22, might have graduated already.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly three years after Massachusetts House lawmakers soundly rejected a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to attend college at in-state tuition rates, lawmakers are preparing to revisit the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Undocumented students say they plan to launch a campaign by lobbying key lawmakers and sharing their stories in face-to-face meetings. Meanwhile, activists have cultivated a broader coalition of supporters that includes union members, business leaders and academics  &mdash;  something lacking in 2006.</p>
<p>State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, D-Boston, said the state&rsquo;s Higher Education Committee is expected to hold hearings on the matter later this year or early next. Chang-Diaz, a co-sponsor of the bill, says it stands a better chance this time, with increased lobbying efforts and support from Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick. Former Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, opposed the measure in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the governor is scheduled to release a list of recommendations from his Advisory Council for Refugees and Immigrants that is expected to include in-state tuition for undocumented students. Patrick sent the panel around the state last year to take public comment and to come up with suggestions for new immigration policy.</p>
<p>Currently, 10 states  &mdash;  California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin  &mdash;  have such in-state tuition laws for undocumented students. Oklahoma repealed its law in 2008.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, four states  &mdash;  Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina  &mdash;  have passed laws specifically banning undocumented students from being eligible for in-state tuition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation estimates that 400 to 600 students might enter Massachusetts schools as a result of the bill and that it likely would result in $2.5 million of extra revenue.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of those 400 to 600 estimated students would receive financial assistance (not loans) or &#8220;diversity&#8221; scholarships over better qualified whites.  This is a joke.</p>

		<p>State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz - now there is a good old Yankee New England name if I ever heard one.  The MINUTE a person identifies himself as an invader he should be deported IMMEDIATELY.  We know his name.  We know his whereabouts.  He has lived off the taxpayers teet for 4 years now.  I am glad he is a very bright boy, he can use his smarts to better Guatemala.  This has to come to an end.  It is sick.</p>
<p>Hopefully Devil Patrick will be a one term wonder.</p>

		<p>Just another way of taking money from the hard-working White people and giving it to the people that the democrats desperately want voting for them.<br>

		<p>A spot at a state university is valuable. Giving a spot at a university to an illegal alien deprives a legal citizen of the right to attend university.</p>

		<p>Undocumented = Illegal = Criminals </p>
<p>Thus, criminals should pay the same tuition as lawful citizens</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t Liberals see this? Doublethink is scary.</p>
<p>Orwell was a genius.</p>

		<p>So this means, quite plainly, that an out-of-state American citizen would have to pay more than a illegal. Where&rsquo;s the logic? </p>
<p>On a side note, many young folks don&rsquo;t understand that as long as a university is not private, the state pays from money for their education while they pay the rest. So drop out rates effect the tax payer too. Thus, it&rsquo;s time to restrict the number of students attending college based purely on MERIT (and of course, citizenship is a prerequisite). Bring our manufactoring jobs back from China and create a sound vocational school system. Our founding fathers never could have imagined the concept of economic sovereignty in a pre-globalist world. Had they been able too, I am sure they would have put that into the constitution as well. </p>

		<p>Well, all I can say is that if this passes, it needs to be publicized, so that non-Mass. residents will spend their out-of-state tuition money elsewhere  &mdash;  if the state schools suffer because of this, that will end this ridiculous proposal.</p>
