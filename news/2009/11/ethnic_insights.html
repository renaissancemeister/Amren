<h1><a href="https://adage.com/ana09/article?article_id=140373">Ethnic Insights Form Foundations of McDonald&rsquo;s Marketing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Bryson York, Ad Age, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The marketing at McDonald&rsquo;s is informed first and foremost by ethnic insights that shape the chain&rsquo;s marketing to African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Then McDonald&rsquo;s lays those insights over work for the general market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethnic segments are leading lifestyle trends,&#8221; Neil Golden, chief marketer officer of McDonald&rsquo;s USA, told the ANA assembly. He added that his team decided to &#8220;start with the ones who are setting the pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also where a lot of the money is. Mr. Golden said 40% of McDonald&rsquo;s current U.S. business comes from the Hispanic, Asian and African-American markets, and 50% of consumers under the age of 13 are from those segments. &#8220;And they&rsquo;re among our most loyal users,&#8221; Mr. Golden said.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;No malls in the ghetto&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} McDonald&rsquo;s has instituted an &#8220;approach that ensures this [ethnic considerations] will never be an afterthought.&#8221; Now during in the product-development cycle, McDonald&rsquo;s looks for a disproportionate level of ethnic insights, he said. Out of nine focus groups, whenever possible, two are Hispanic, two are Asian, two are African American and the remaining three represent the rest of the market.</p>
<p>When McDonald&rsquo;s takes its ads to market, the chain makes sure that spending behind certain spots represents the country&rsquo;s ethnic makeup, such as 15% behind Hispanic marketing, 12% behind African America, 5% behind Asian.</p>
<p>As for the ad-creative-development process, Mr. Golden said each ethnic agency is given a blank canvas  &mdash;  within the &#8220;I&rsquo;m Lovin&rsquo; It&#8221; framework  &mdash;  to create campaigns that will resonate in the respective market. The chain&rsquo;s McCafe launch, for instance, included a Hispanic push aimed at the increasingly empowered Latina. The Asian McCafe work focused on the quality of ingredients. And while McCafe is performing well in the general market, it&rsquo;s doing even better in many ethnically driven locations.</p>
<p>The chain has also looked for more meaningful touchpoints, including a scholarship program for Hispanic students in Texas and tie-ins with Lunar New Year celebrations to target the Asian community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s paying off. McDonald&rsquo;s ethnic marketing continues to receive accolades from trusted names in the communities they&rsquo;re targeting, such as Latina Style and Black Enterprise magazine.</p>
<p>He also pointed out McDonald&rsquo;s &#8220;walks the talk&#8221; in its C-suite as well. His boss, McDonald&rsquo;s USA President Don Thompson, is African American. Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s boss, Chief Operating Officer Ralph Alvarez, is Hispanic. CEO Jim Skinner has said his goal is not to have to talk about it anymore.</p>

Blacks are the snake that turns and strikes.</p>
<p>Blacks want companies to cater to them but when health issues start to rise, blacks will turn on McDonalds for targeting them, exploiting them, and selling them poison.</p>

		<p>Soon McDonald&rsquo;s will have even a higher percentage of non-white customers as more and more of us are no longer eating in their establishments.  I would rather just go home and make a sandwich for myself than continue to give money to another globalist corporation that is actively working to make me a second class citizen in my own country.</p>

		<p>And this is supposed to be good news?  The left-wing busy body do-gooders are having a fit over how unhealthy fast food is.  Once they get wind of the fact that McDonalds has successful racial and ethnic advertising, they&rsquo;ll accuse McDs of engaging in a secret conspiracy to clog the arteries of blacks and Hispanics.  Perhaps Prof. McIntyre at Columbia can pitch in with a study about the racist architecture of a typical McDonalds location.</p>

<p>How utterly laughable.</p>
<p>Maybe McDiversity&rsquo;s Propaganda Minister, Comrade Golden needs to change his name to Comrade Foolsgold. When this country becomes a petrified Third World poverty parlor, there will no longer be an easily dismissed &ldquo;rest of the market,&rdquo; or what could otherwise be called McDiversity&rsquo;s original American base of customers. They will of course, by that point, not be wasting their money or vigor on tasty trash foods, but simply looking to survive and eat nutritionally balanced meals to aid in that goal.  </p>
<p>Would it not be ironic, if when things ever do really change, it is noted that Propaganda Minister, Comrade Golden and other traitors like him, did help to excessively poison our &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; nonwhite foes. Not that this should get them off the hook mind you. It should only serve as an example of how even the most arrogantly and greedy of treacheries, can inadvertently have some positive ripples.</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

		<p>The last time my wife and I ate at this fast food outlet she became very ill that night.  She had commented that the place was dirty and would never pass a military dining hall inspection for numerous reasons.  After becoming ill with vomit and a high fever we both stated that was the last visit to this popular fast food outlet.  After reading this article all becomes clear now. </p>

		<p>Why should it be a surprise that blacks and Hispanics are MacDonald&rsquo;s biggest customers?</p>
<p>After all, what&rsquo;s easier than eating fast-food.  No preparation, no clean-up, no visit to the supermarket.  It fits their lifestyle perfectly.</p>

		<p>this article explains to me why McDonald&rsquo;s believes they can freely get away with their &#8220;Black/365&#8221; baloney.</p>
<p>I e-mailed them a year ago, got back the obligatory diversity letter, and promptly stopped going to their restaurants.</p>
<p>Not only have I found Wendy&rsquo;s food to be better but they invest heavily in adoptions and &#8216;life&rsquo; charities.  Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if I heard that McDonald&rsquo;s took the opposite approach to innocent life.</p>

<p>Yeah right, these dying publications are just happy to see the ad revenue. The fact that a big corporation is pandering to their niche market is the cherry on top.</p>

		<p>The so-called &#8220;ethnic marketing&#8221; is actually affecting White youths and assisting in their &#8220;acting Black&#8221;.  Many companies target Blacks and portray Blacks in their commercials as a way of encouraging Whites to behave as Blacks.  The proof is what we see everywhere in this country - White youths dressing, acting, walking and talking like Blacks.  White youths are now even listening to Black rap music.  White girls are dating - more and more - Black males.  The commercials on TV - more and more are depicting White women with or next to Black men.  This is no accident.  How much longer will it take to dumb-down Whites completely?</p>

		<p>Westwood Village, next to UCLA, was the Great Date Place 30 years ago.  Catch a movie, get something to eat, take a walk around.  All the eating places were independent, and somewhat pricey.  Almost all the people were White.  Then a McDonald&rsquo;s moved in.  Suddenly, Blacks had a place to eat, and they came to hang out and block the sidewalks with their break dancing.  One summer, Blacks killed 3 Whites and a Japanese woman, and Westwood Village dried up.  <br>
     Thanks.  </p>

		<p>When I see 2-3 blacks behind the counter at any food place, I head for the exit w/o ordering.  One behind the cash register is equally disconcerting.  I can only guess how many whites feel the same way.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to a McDonald&rsquo;s in 30 years. I don&rsquo;t intend to start now. The food is as disgusting as their ad campaign. <br>
Chick Fil-A has much better food, higher standards, more &#8216;refined&rsquo; help, and a Christian principle. I commend Truitt Cathy for his way of operating a business.</p>
