			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Chapman, Daily Mail (London), November 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Tory Parliamentary candidate was suspended by the party last night after complaining that people bidding to become an MP did not have &#8216;normal&rsquo; English names.</p>
<p>Councillor Peter Hobbins is accused of sending racist emails to colleagues attacking the list of prospective Parliamentary candidates for the Orpington seat in Kent.</p>
<p>It is the latest selection row to hit the party following the revolt of activists in Norfolk against a Conservative candidate who had an affair.</p>
<p>Their defiance of David Cameron&rsquo;s high command led to them being nicknamed the &#8216;turnip Taliban&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Hobbins, who stood unsuccessfully for the Tories at the 2001 election and was shortlisted for the London mayoral race, suggested he should change his name to &#8216;Petrado&rsquo; to succeed in the party.</p>
<p>One email said: &#8216;I have been contacted by a Mr Dilon Gumraj and a Zerha Zaidi and others who are all on the approved Conservative Parliamentary Candidates list.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not one of them has a &#8216;normal&rsquo; English name.</p>
<p>&#8216;They want to be the PPCs for Orpington and asked me for my personal advice on how they would be the best candidates for the Orpington Constituency. My view? For Hell&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>&#8216;Why are the Candidates Department so keen on these foreign names?!!!! Maybe I should change my name to something foreign  &mdash;  how does Petrado Indiano Hobbinso sound to you?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hobbins also said he was fed up with reading about &#8216;Africa&rsquo; on the CVs of would-be candidates.</p>
<p>Orpington Conservative Association chairman John Esler, one of the recipients, said: &#8216;Councillor Hobbins shouldn&rsquo;t have sent these emails. They were entirely inappropriate.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t read all of it as I decided it was not worth the effort. But he definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have sent them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chuka Umanna, Labour&rsquo;s Parliamentary candidate for Streatham, South London, said: &#8216;The language used by Councillor Hobbins  &mdash;  shortlisted by David Cameron to run London  &mdash;  is offensive in the extreme and shows his party has not come to terms with modern Britain.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are told the Tory Taliban surge in Norfolk was an isolated incident  &mdash;  but clearly there is a growing insurgency in the party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Tory spokesman said: &#8216;Councillor Hobbins has been immediately suspended from the Conservative Party and from the Conservative Group on Bromley council and he will play no part in the selection of the Parliamentary candidate. There is no room for racism in the Conservative Party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Orpington, a safe Tory seat, is selecting a candidate for next year&rsquo;s election, when MP John Horam steps down.</p>
<p>The row comes after Mr Cameron thwarted the &#8216;turnip Taliban&rsquo; revolt against the candidate for South West Norfolk, Liz Truss.</p>
<p>Local party members were angered after she failed to tell them she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field.</p>
<p>Tory HQ says it has been &#8216;inundated&rsquo; with more than 4,000 applications from a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; range of people responding to Mr Cameron&rsquo;s decision to reopen the candidates&rsquo; list in May.</p>
<p>The 150 new candidates on the approved list include businesswoman Merryn Myatt, who hosted a TV consumer show, and Colonel Bob Stewart, who received the Distinguished Service Order for gallantry in Bosnia.<br>

		<p>I understand the guy completely. If I were to visit the UK I&rsquo;d want to come across people called Smith, Jones, Thompson etc, who can trace their family heritage back many generations, not Singh&rsquo;s, Abdullah&rsquo;s, and Chen&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tens of millions of those elsewhere in the world already and I might one day get the chance to visit them in their own homelands too, where I would be most disappointed if I came across a ton of Smith&rsquo;s, Joneses and so on.</p>

		<p>How rich of them.  First they engineer (or remain complacent while others engineer) the replacement of indigenous Britons by non-whites, then they have the nerve to call the results of their treason &#8220;modern Britain&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll walk up to every person who sports a &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; bumper sticker and I&rsquo;ll tell them, &#8220;you must come to terms with modern Tibet&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the Tories are indeed coming to terms with modern Britain. Watch them adopt some issues from the BNP like immigration and take their votes.</p>

		<p>Right.  There&rsquo;s no room for racism in the Conservative Party  &mdash;  unless it involves genocidal policies against whites.  Mr Hobbins should join the BNP.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Chuka Umanna&#8221; - that name only underscores the points so well made by Mr. Hobbins.  England is in bad shape.  Free speech is suppressed and abridged in the most glaringly militant manner ever.  I hope the people will rise up and save England for the English while there is still an England to save.  Though part of the UK, I hope Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are, in true Celtic fashion, holding the immigrant infidels at bay.  I&rsquo;d like to see Ireland remain Irish, too.  Though getting on in years, I&rsquo;d fight for Scotland at the drop of a hat.</p>

		<p>In Kenya, in India, in Hong Kong, in Malaysia, in Jamaica and in many other places around the globe the British were compelled to move on. They were told the British administrators, soldiers, businessmen, missionaries, physicians, educators, and civil engineers were unwanted and unneeded. Because of a rising tide of nationalism and pride, they all wanted &#8220;Brits Out!&#8221;<br>
    Well, they got their independence and their &#8220;pride&#8221; but soon enough many among them were longing for the good old days of colonialism  &mdash;  -when there weren&rsquo;t ethnic riots, food shortages, and blackouts. You can&rsquo;t go home again.<br>
    And now the shoe is on the other foot: Britain is colonized and made to conform to farangi ways. So the questions have to be asked, &#8220;Do the people of Britain deserve self-determination? Do the people of Britain deserve to be regarded as a distinct people? Do the people of Britain have the right to be governed by people who look like them and have English surnames? <br>
    Could a White man named Harold Baker or Chuck Adams enter government in Zimbabwe or Pakistan? Would the people applaud if he rose to the higher levels? Or would they be angry and ashamed?<br>
    Britain for the British! </p>

		<p>As &#8216;minorities&rsquo; become greater in number they need minorities to represent them. When minorities are small in number, they need minorities in figure-head positions, to inspire and mentor them. And of course, it&rsquo;s all because they live in a racially tinged society. Because only whites are racists.  </p>

Whilst we need rid of the labour XXXXX where you can vote BNP or UKIP. Saw 18% of voters polled recently were voting for fringe parties so we could have an upset or two.</p>

		<p>Chuka Umanna represents Streatham in South West London.</p>
<p>Back in the late 1970s, when I was a teenager, I had a friend who lived in a big house in Streatham with his family. It was a beautiful neighbourhood, and very middle-class English in character. It was close to Streatham Common, with views of the North Downs in Surrey. I used to love visiting it.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I found myself in the same area on business. I had not been there for nearly thirty years, and I decided to visit the street where my friend had lived. The beautifully-maintained houses of the 1970s were now slums, the paving slabs were painted with the colours of the South African flag, and there were burned out cars and other detritus littered along the street. Needless to say, there was not a single English person in sight.</p>
<p>THIS is the &#8220;modern Britain&#8221; that Chuka Umanna and the Conservative Party demand that we &#8220;come to terms with&#8221;.</p>

		<p>@9  UKIP is not against immigration, it is tory with a different name, sadly even Brits don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>BNP is your last very small glimmer of hope, but very few undestand it, your country is virtually gone, doomed.</p>
<p>Most of the English, even the highly educated are brainwashed, they forgot what it means to be English and accept the enlightment brought by immigrants from Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Game over, there will be a country in name only UK or England, however the population will have nothing to do with England, some English mulattoes at best.<br>

		<p>Call it the Barack Hussein Obama effect. Even the Torry party in Britain (which I understand is the mainstream &#8216;right-wing&rsquo; alternative to labour) thinks that everyone will go ga-ga if it nominates candidates with the most exotic names and backgrounds imaginable for public office.</p>

<p>You must be some sort of clairvoyant.  Within two days after Barack Obama was elected President, one of the Brit papers (I think it was the Telegraph) did an article about the TORY party&rsquo;s effort to find &#8220;Our&#8221; (the U.K.&rsquo;s) &#8220;Barack Obama.&#8221;  Basically, they wanted to shove the scant few racial minorities the Tories have in public office up to the front bench ASAP.  Of course, what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander, and if I had the chance, I would have asked David Cameron, who signed off on &#8221; finding our/their Obama,&#8221; if he will resign as opposition leader (or PM should the Tories win power) if they can find a Tory minority person.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct about the Tories on this issue.  This is the latest development on that front.</p>
<p>The  CONS have become so politically correct that Comrade Bercow now proposes that all rejected non-white Positive Discrimination applications for public servant positions in the Tory Party, are examined to make sure that there was no covert <i>racism</i> at work in their original evaluations, the possibility of such hidden racism being attributable to white men only, of course.</p>
<p>http://bnp.org.uk/2009/11/speaker-wants-parties-to-declare-how-many-ethnic-candidates-they-reject/</p>
<p>In the meantime, <b>I&rsquo;m just waiting to see how long it&rsquo;ll take Bercow (or Berkco, morelike) to put his money where his mouth is,</b> </p>
<p>ie, <i><b>resign his very prominent job and attractive salary over to a non-white?</b></i><br>

		<p>This sort of punishment is inescapable for any white person who even appears to be defending white people or stating obvious truths about multi-culturalism and what it is doing to western societies.</p>
<p>It is fear of such punishment that keeps many white &#8220;fanatics&#8221; in the closet. Any even remotely &#8220;objectionable&#8221; comment innocently made to a fellow worker, collegue, acquaintance can result in instant ostracism, loss of job or defamed reputation. So most just grin and bear it.</p>
<p>It almost does take &#8220;fanaticism&#8221; to stand up in face of this - a wonton disregard for the consequences of fighting for your principals and beliefs. But nothing will change without it.</p>

		<p>Right on&hellip; agree with #2,4,6,13,14 &hellip;it becomes clear national governments with white heritage have become servants for multicult-diveristy/eco religion.  Those who have betrayed their own need to look  in the mirror because they too will be dispensed with when the &#8216;others&rsquo; take over like Africa.  All the once &#8216;so called&rsquo; colonial subjects of Britain ran them out and became what they are.  Now, they want to migrate back to the better life they rejected.  No one seems to notice the chosen backward regressive lives of countries sending millions of migrants to other lands for colonization; especially UK and US!</p>
<p>We need to gather a strong offense to the outright legislated suppression of our heritage and nation. Global legal schemes with international bankers to usurp power are not the majority. Protect borders as did ancestors with force and motes.</p>

<p>Well Sir, there is pleny of opportunity for disappointment - just visit Canada, the United States, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand - those places you will find a ton of Smith&rsquo;s, Joneses and so on. Funny thing is I never understood those same places to be historically white.</p>
