			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cliff Kincaid, Accuracy in Media, November 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>*Editor&rsquo;s Note: The Wright video linked to in Cliff Kincaid&rsquo;s column, Controversial New Video of Obama&rsquo;s Pastor, has been deleted. But the same video can still be viewed on YouTube in three parts. Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP6_qtLoW98&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="part1">part one</a>, part two, and part three.  {snip}</p>
<p>A new video of Jeremiah Wright has surfaced, showing Barack Obama&rsquo;s pastor of 20 years praising Marxism and discussing his ties to communists in El Salvador and Nicaragua and the Libyan government. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the video, which captures Wright&rsquo;s appearance at a September 17, 2009, anniversary celebration of Monthly Review, Wright said that while the &#8220;corporate media&#8221; provide a &#8220;binary lens&#8221; of the world, in such terms as &#8220;communist versus Christian,&#8221; Monthly Review offers what it calls &#8220;no-nonsense Marxism.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;You dispel all the negative images we have been programmed to conjure up with just the mention of that word socialism or Marxism.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called America &#8220;land of the greed and home of the slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the Monthly Review celebration, however, he went into more detail about his own personal and political philosophy. He said that &#8220;My work with liberation theology, with Latin American theologians, with the Black Theology Project and with the Cuban Council of Churches taught me 30 years ago the importance of Marx and the Marxist analysis of the social realities of the vulnerable and the oppressed who were trying desperately to break free of the political economics undergirded by this country that were choking them and cutting off any hope of a possible future where all of the people would benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that his &#8220;exposure to the FMLN in El Salvador, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and my presence at the 15th Jamahiriya in Libya taught me what I have read in the pages of the Monthly Review which is, as Joshua Stanton says, though we need not always agree with one another we must do the work necessary to at least understand one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FMLN was the armed wing of the communist movement in El Salvador, while the Sandinistas are the communist movement in Nicaragua. The Cuban Council of Churches is controlled by the Castro regime. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Wright used his appearance at the Monthly Review event to quote Frantz Fanon, the revolutionary also cited in Obama&rsquo;s book, Dreams from My Father.</p>
<p>However, his only reference to Obama in the speech came when he complained about Obama going to &#8220;beg the big fat cats&#8221; on Wall Street to stop irresponsible financial practices.</p>
<p>In a recap of the celebration, the Monthly Review editors declared, &#8220;We would like to thank all those who participated in this extraordinary event. Dr. Wright captured the tone of the evening, declaring that: &#8216;Militarism, capitalism and racism, domestic oppression, foreign military aggression, victims of neo-colonialism, victims of community and national racism, and the Cold War days in its infancy to the needless war in Vietnam in its [MR&rsquo;s] second decade, through wars of greed in Afghanistan and Iraq in [its] sixth decade&rsquo; were all incisively covered by the magazine. He spoke of Monthly Review&rsquo;s indefatigable insistence on the need to put &#8216;people before profits,&rsquo; and its unflinching criticisms of inequality, injustice, and the realities of capitalism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand listening to this muttering old fool ramble on, so i had to cut him off.  It&rsquo;s just too boring, and he&rsquo;s so predictable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s reading from a page and doing quite a poor job of it too.  I saw the excerpt of this talk on T.V. last night.  It was just more of the whining about how bad this country was.</p>
<p>Get over it, Reverend.  Blacks have not succeeded as EVERY OTHER RACE in this country has because they don&rsquo;t have the INTELLECT OR ABILITY.  It has nothing to do with oppression, racism or the system.  They do just as dismally all over the world, including and ESPECIALLY Africa.  Why should this country be an exception?</p>

		<p>We were warned of men as you are Mr. Wright, warned by a very high source, The Holy Bible KJV.<br>
2 Timothy 3:2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <br>
3:3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,<br>
3:4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; <br>
3:5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
3:6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
3:7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </p>

		<p>This character somehow does not bother to get his hands dirty in trying to resolve the mindless and endless problems of his country of origin (Africa).  Africa will always need other races for help.  The harm concerning this mindless slew of garbage is that some whites actually take it quite literally and seriously and then force it upon the rest of this country.  The question that needs to be asked is what does blacks have to offer to this country that is better than what whites have accomplished?  As with this character, it is endless manipulation to be supported by someone&rsquo;s money.  He lives in a gated community but yets complains how this country has enslaved and abused.  Whites need to stand up and say enough is enough as that very brave white girl in Richmond, CA did after her friend was brutally raped.  The video is still online.</p>

		<p>Dr. Wright, [I guess he calls himself a Dr., so many of them do] now lives in a gated all-white community [except for himself being the only non-white] NOT too far from me, his house being 10,000 square feet and costing $5 million, or is it 5,000 square feet and $10 million? Those figures always confuse me. And this for a man in retirement with the option of having an indoor pool installed in the home if he so desires. And probably gets a religious tax exemption for the home too. These guys talk about greed but know how to game the system!!</p>

The dismal reality is that blacks do marginally better as a minority in white nations than a majority if black nations.</p>
<p>In overwhelming numbers, they destroy the host nation because black behavior is universal.</p>

<p>That must be the longest sentence I&rsquo;ve ever laid eyes upon.  Has old Jer ever heard of &#8220;run-ons&#8221;?  This Wright is a crazed fellow, and, although they practice what they do from a slightly different angle, I have now lumped J.Wright into the incredibly worthless group that includes Jesse Jackson and A. Sharpton. </p>
<p>&#8220;However, his only reference to Obama in the speech came when he complained about Obama going to &ldquo;beg the big fat cats&rdquo; on Wall Street to stop irresponsible financial practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then of course, this, a perfect example of how blacks cant get along with anybody, let alone each other.  An obamanation is the only reason ANYBODY outside of South Chicago knows this hapless clown, and yet he still moans about his bro the Messiah.  What a tired act this is from all these blacks and it doesn&rsquo;t seem its going to end.</p>

		<p>People complain about Obama sitting in the pews,  but hasn&rsquo;t the Republican party,  National Review,  and the rest of the Conservative establishment sat in those same pews for the last several decades?  They&rsquo;ve remained silent in the face of an unprecedented genocidal hate-spew against whites streaming from non-whites, the media, the left, and the universities.   They didn&rsquo;t even have the guts or decency in fact to make an issue out of Wright,  the objections had to bubble up from below on the Internet.  They served their usual purpose in the system - to act as the first line of defense for America hating,  white hating political correctness.   Here&rsquo;s all you really need to know about the nature of American society and politics and the Republican/Conservative place in it:  no prominent Republican  or Conservative would ever dare to make an issue out of a crime like the Christian/Newsome atrocity,  as soon as they see that it involves white victims and non-white perpetrators they avert their eyes and cross the street.   They are owned by their political opponents.    It is primarily a matter of crookedness - they are only really interested in money and will avoid any confrontation because it is bad for business,  they&rsquo;ve adopted to politics the principles and practices of amoral business, where you cater to and flatter anyone,  no matter how despicable,  if doing so increases the chance for profit.    In that they act just like all those major corporations (which they are so close to) that pump money almost exclusively  into politically correct charities in order to buy indulgences from power.     And of course the bill for all this falls on their lower class supporters.   In the long run they know they are feeding the crocodile,  but there&rsquo;s the all-important quarterly report to consider,  just like in American business. </p>

		<p>This title of Reverend that they and others give themselves, and usually demand they are called (as in Jesse Jackson did on tv recently when mistaken for Al Sharpton), is unbiblical in nature and takes on something which they most certainly are not.  The Bible says in, I believe, Psalm 111:9  &hellip;..Holy and Reverend is His name.  The only time it is mentioned in the Bible is in reference to God.  So, I tend to get mean looks when I refer to them as simply mister, or by their first name like we do with our own preacher.   </p>
