<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police busted Lionel McIntyre, 59, [a prominent Columbia architecture professor] for assault yesterday after his bruised victim, Camille Davis, [a university employee] filed charges.</p>
<p>McIntyre and Davis, who works as a production manager in the school&rsquo;s theater department, are both regulars at Toast, a popular university bar on Broadway and 125th Street [in Harlem], sources said.</p>
<p>The professor, who is black, had been engaged in a fiery discussion about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; with Davis, who is white, and another male regular, who is also white, Friday night at 10:30 when fists started flying, patrons said.</p>
<p>McIntyre, who is known as &#8220;Mac&#8221; at the bar, shoved Davis, and when the other patron and a bar employee tried to break it up, the prof slugged Davis in the face, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The punch was so loud, the kitchen workers in the back heard it over all the noise,&#8221; bar back Richie Velez, 28, told The Post. &#8220;I was on my way over when he punched Camille and she fell on top of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other patron involved in the dispute said McIntyre then took a swing at him after he yelled, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t hit a woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McIntyre had squabbled with Davis several weeks earlier over issues involving race, witnesses said. As soon as the professor threw the punch Friday, server Rob Dalton and another employee tossed him out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McIntyre was released without bail at his arraignment last night.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very unfortunate event,&#8221; he said afterwards. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t mean for it to explode the way it did.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This reminds me of the case in the early 1980s when a Black Dartmouth Professor took issue with something a white conservative student wrote in the Dartmouth Review and did the logical thing, bit him hard enough to draw some serious blood. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I read the book that the student later wrote, but I think it was called &#8220;Poisoned Ivy&#8221; (or &#8220;Poison Ivy&#8221;) by Ben Hart. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this guy on many a discussion show. </p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sorry for what happened to Camille Davis, kudos to her for speaking her mind. I hope we find out exactly how the conversation went.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the Tim Wise white privilege spin or the beer summit at the White House. (Oh sorry, there won&rsquo;t be one. Not this time.)<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the upcoming demonstration of &#8220;black privilege&#8221; will not be lost on the professor when nothing happens to him and the university sweeps it under the table because of his race. If a white professor struck a black female he&rsquo;d be fired the next day amid violent protests all over campus condemning him.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of blacks getting pampered and excused for killing or beating the hell out of whites simply for &#8220;racist&#8221; comments.  Talk about being insecure with yourself that you have to punch someone for disagreeing with you.</p>

<p> Of course he was dead wrong to hit a woman; that goes without saying. But as they say, &#8220;Consider the source.&#8221; Hopefully Davis and &#8220;Shannon&#8221; learned their lesson from that and will stay out of Harlem after this.</p>

<p>This attack by Comrade McIntyre is not what surprises me, but the soundly reasonable of the white man to it. Too bad he didn&rsquo;t take the opportunity to smash good old Comrade McIntyre&rsquo;s face in, but that probably would have landed him in jail on an asinine charge of &ldquo;excessive white privilege brutality,&rdquo; or some other such nonsense. Thus, he gets a pass from me on this; for what that is worth, which would be somewhere between a stick of gum and a gumball.</p>
<p>However, the larger question is this: will Comrade BO feel compelled to defend this misunderstood black berserker of academia, like he did the last one? Will it involve beer again, or given the level of violence, will Martinis or Long Island Ice Teas be required this time? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Ah yes, white privilege   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the sort of &#8220;privilege&#8221; that permits a white woman to be physically attacked without provocation from a black man, and then to be blamed for it because of some perceived racial slight.

		<p>I can see the future:  Prof. McIntyre will pioneer the field of white privilege in architecture.  In his class, you will be asked to find secret messages hidden in pre-1950 buildings, and their engineering and architectural plans, the secret messages showing a secret racist anti-black genocidal conspiracy.  Once your done with that, then you&rsquo;ll be asked to play Def Leppard records backwards and at double speed to hear the Satanic dirges&hellip;</p>

		<p>Violence is what people resort to when they lack the intellectual faculties to argue like a sensible adult. No doubt, Lionel McIntyre got his job as an Ivy League professor because of affirmative action over a more qualified, more intelligent white. His resorting to violence is indicitive of his lack of mental substance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the media is reporting this obvious, black-on-white <i>hate crime,</i> but can you imagine the pandemonium in the national media if a white Ivy League professor hit a black woman over an arguement about black privilege (i.e. affirmative action, bussing to much better schools, pro-black media bias, etc.)? The media would utterly butcher him because he&rsquo;s white, but because the man in question was black the media will play down the incident and cut him some slack (they even presented him in an apologetic manner).</p>

<p>It was not an &#8220;unfortunate incident&#8221;. This man chose to act like a 2-year old. Why was he released without any bail? One usually must post something to get released on assault charges. He&rsquo;ll keep his job, his good salary and everything else. He should be fired but he won&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>&#8220;White privilege&#8221; is just the black man&rsquo;s way of saying that he&rsquo;s unhappy with the state of his existence.  Where he errs is in correlating this unhappiness with the presence of white people, assuming white privilege isn&rsquo;t just a euphemism for black envy.  </p>
<p>White privilege cannot exist where everyone is white.  White people have as high a quality of life (probably better) in places where there are nearly no blacks.  On the flip side, the quality of life is far worse in exclusively black nations verses where they share land with whites, and that&rsquo;s not the white man&rsquo;s fault!</p>
<p>To sum it up, white privilege is a myth because being black is no better in the absence of white people, and being white is no better in the presence of black people.  The good things about being white are not derived from some privilege that&rsquo;s acquired at the expense of blacks.  </p>

		<p>Imagine the outcry if a white professor had punched a black woman. Forget that! Imagine the outcry if a white professor had even <i>said</i> something considered &#8220;racist&#8221; to a black woman! There would be candlelight vigils, nightly protests, prayer vigils, rallys, speakers with bullhorns calling for his immediate dismissal and blacklisting from every university in the land, &#8220;tolerance&#8221; convocations, endless soul-searching for &#8220;racism&#8221; throughout the campus, demonstrations with marchers holding picket signs, required courses in &#8220;tolerance&#8221; for every student, etc. etc. etc. In this case, there will merely be a terse apology from McIntyre and the whole thing will be forgotten the next day.</p>
<p>Notice also how McIntyre had <i>two</i> opportunities to cool down that he refused to take, first when the bar employee tried to break up the fight and then when he tried to violently attack the other person present.</p>
<p>Then notice the very lame explanation he gave afterwards: &ldquo;It was a very unfortunate event. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for it to explode the way it did.&rdquo; As he was merely a passive observer!</p>

Lookit, we can babble all we want about the obvious hijacking of our culture, nation and gene pool by blacks.  In the end we can all agree yet it will do nothing to stem the tide.  <br>
While I laud these discussion boards as they give me some form of sanity, we must find a way to act and curtail our racial elimination.</p>

<p>Um this area is actually morningside heights and is very trendy and bascially an extension of the yuppie Upper West Side. A peninsula of whitetopia protruding into the jungle. As for your other question, judging by his brutish behavior it is probably safe to assume that the distinguisehd professor was imposing himself on the other bar patrons with his drunken ramblings about white oppression. </p>
<p>With all the recent news of lawsuits against nightclubs for banning baggy pants and ghetto attire in an effort to weed out the criminal element, and with the professor&rsquo;s obvious fragile ego and sense of entitlement, they probably could not figure out a way of banning him from the bar without a major incident.</p>
<p>I am sure that secretly the bar owners are rejoicing at the excuse arising to finally ban an aggressive obnoxious drunk from their bar who has probably been chasing away patrons for years.<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s ironic is despite the fact that blacks and their buffoonish anti-racist white allies (Tim Wise comes to mind) attack any form of privilege as insidious, many of them either live in privilege or seek privilege. Why is it that black college professors such as &#8220;Mac&#8221; generally live in white neighborhoods and seek to emulate the white standard of living? Many of these whiny black scholars such as Michael Eric Dyson, Cornel West, Marc Lamont Hill, and others live in nice houses, enjoy numerous economic privileges and the prestige that comes with being a professor, and generally teach in predominantly white institutions. When blacks bash &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; they are really just expressing their envy for our success, which they see as a product of our oppression of them. While everyone seems to hate privilege and &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in particular, everyone also wants to enjoy such privileges. After all, who really wants to lack privilege? Despite identifying with poor blacks and asserting that disadvantaged blacks are superior to whites, anti-racists would never trade places with them. However, perhaps if this professor is fired, stripped of all his possessions, and sent to prison for life, then I&rsquo;ll be convinced that there is still some &#8220;white privilege&#8221; left in this nation. I say it is about time his theory of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; be put to the test.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it? The &#8220;man&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t punch out an 59-year old black architect? Sure, he is a white Columbia liberal, but you would think he had enough testosterone to punch a man who just attacked a woman.</p>
<p>As for the black racist there is ZERO chance he will lose his job. It is Columbia after all. They will probably fire the white woman for saying there is not white skin privilege.</p>

<p>The fact is that a White male professor did punch a Black female student in the face during an argument about affirmative action. This happened in 1999 at Colby College. The school is an upscale liberal arts college located in Waterville, Maine. Several New England newspapers, including the Boston Globe carried the story for a few days.</p>
<p>The professor was suspended for a year with half pay and ordered to write the student a letter of apology and enroll in an anger management course.</p>

<p>I sent this email:</p>
<p>Dear President Bollinger:</p>
<p>Please dismiss Prof. Lionel McIntyre for his inexcusable behavior.</p>
<p>If he were WHITE, and had struck a BLACK woman in an argument about race (or about anything), he would not be retained.</p>
<p>To give him special consideration because he is black would be patronizing.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even have the manners to lie and say he&rsquo;s sorry. Of course the only thing he&rsquo;s sorry about is that it hasn&rsquo;t been made legal for a black man to slug a white woman whenever a black man pleases, so that the black man&rsquo;s savage impulses can be &#8220;free at last&#8221;!</p>
<p>If you grew up in the segregated South as I did, you&rsquo;ll feel the utter degradation of our having arrived at a point where there could even be a news article, &#8220;Black man slugs white woman in argument over race.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish we could stuff this guy and his crime in a time machine and send him back to anywhere in the South in 1950. He might get a reprieve for obvious insanity, since his crime would have been inconceivable in the South in 1950.</p>
<p>The Southern system was in place because it kept a lid on the sudden eruption of blacks&rsquo; savage impulses.</p>
<p>As this story sinks in, I&rsquo;m way beyond enraged.</p>

		<p>Too many times, it has been my experience that it is useless to expect to intelligently argue with blacks.  As soon as it looks like they are losing the argument, the childishness comes out, no matter what level of &#8221; intellect&#8221; they appear to possess. I would love to see this fool get nailed, but this incident happened in New York City.  But the other commentator on this site who talked about the anger of light-skinned blacks got it right.  Just further proof that no matter what happens to or for blacks which is good, it&rsquo;s never enough.  </p>

<p>They are?  I have heard or read nothing about this case here in S. California.  I&rsquo;ve only seen it mentioned here on AmRen and heard Rush Limbaugh speak of it today.  Was it on CNN (which I refuse to watch) as it certainly would be if the races were reversed?  Was it in any of the major papers or on any of the alphabet networks?</p>

<p>Thanks for the link.  I too wrote an e mail of protest to the president of the university  &mdash;  and so should everyone here!</p>
<p>I told him I was furious that a professor, employed by a university that is supposed to be a bastion of tolerance, open ideas and free speech, resorted to extreme violence when he disagreed with another&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>I also wrote that this violent sociopath must be fired immediately for sucker punching a woman so hard that  &#8220;the kitchen workers in the back heard it over all the noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no excuse for this type of violence.  He should be charged with not only assault, but with Hate Crimes enhancement as well, as would a White professor were he to sucker punch a black.</p>
<p>And if he, as the university&rsquo;s president and representative, chooses not to fire this professor, what kind of example is he presenting to students, prospective students, professors and the alumni?  Would it not be hypocritical to claim that the university is tolerant of a diversity of opinions? </p>
<p>Or is it university&rsquo;s position that if one doesn&rsquo;t agree with another&rsquo;s opinion,  a well-reasoned argument is not necessary  &mdash;  better to deck your opponent to get your point across?</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>And yes, I know Columbia is not a bastion of free thought/opinion.<br>

		<p>To Harumphty Dumpty:</p>
<p>This is the e-mail I sent to Mr. Bollinger:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Bollinger,</p>
<p>Greetings, sir.  As president of Columbia University, I&rsquo;m sure you must have your day filled with reports of all the activities, good and bad, on your campus.  Nevertheless, I feel I must in good conscience send you this e-mail to tell you how disgusted I am with the recent conduct of one of your faculty members, Lionel McIntyre.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m sure you have already been briefed on the particulars of the incident in question, there&rsquo;s no need for me to repeat them to you.  Let me impress upon you though, Mr. Bollinger, my feelings that there is simply no place on the faculty of Columbia U. for a man like Mr. McIntyre.  He issued a statement afterwards in which he called his assault on Camille Davis &#8220;a very unfortunate event.&#8221;  Really?  When I was growing up we were told assault (especially a man assaulting a woman) was a felony!</p>
<p>According to the media report I read, the assault followed a tense argument over the controversial concept of &#8220;White skin privilege.&#8221;  That he concluded this argument with a vicious assault on a White female leads me to wonder if in fact this should not be investigated as a hate crime.  If McIntyre was White and Davis was Black you can be sure that in fact would happen.  Regardless of his reasons, at the very least &#8220;Prof.&#8221; McIntyre has shown he possesses no self-control and should be terminated from his employment asap.</p>
<p>My goddaughter, who is currently in high school (and an honors student) has expressed an interest in attending Columbia after she graduates.  If McIntyre is an example of the calibre of the faculty there, I shall do my best to impress upon her parents to send her elsewhere.  Thank you.</p>

<p>AJ is  exactly right.  And very well put too!   A  &#8220;peninsula of whiteopia&#8221; it is!   It&rsquo;s an extension  (though somewhat precarious) of the Upper West Side.

<p>While 125th St. may lie technically  within Harlem, this area is an overflow from Columbia U.  There&rsquo;s  a lot of Columbia housing nearby.   This &#8220;encroachment&#8221;  from Columbia has for years been a source of aner and  resentment among Harlem  blacks  who feel that this area is &#8220;theirs&#8221; and that whites have no business being here.

		<p>The complement to the term &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is the term &#8220;underprivileged.&#8221; </p>
<p>I posted this on the mainstream site I post at:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good post. My only quarrel is the use of &#8216;underprivileged&rsquo; as a casual identifier.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine to use the word when privilege or the lack of it is being explicitly discussed.</p>
<p>But in other contexts it&rsquo;s one of those brainwashing words that slips in subliminal reinforcement of sympathy for a lot of people who don&rsquo;t deserve it, by implying that the rest of us are better behaved only by force of certain privileges that we don&rsquo;t really deserve. </p>
<p>Those of us who are &#8216;privileged&rsquo; to come from decent families and circumstances enjoy that &#8216;privilege&rsquo; primarily because our parents and their parents and so on worked hard and behaved, and created a &#8216;privileged&rsquo; environment for us.</p>
<p>Sorry to pick on one thing in a good post, but the enemies of decency have controlled the terms of discourse, and it sways every argument to their side.</p>
<p>I think the word that served formerly was simply, &#8216;poor,&rsquo; which at least described a prominent and important aspect of their condition, without carrying also a moral pre-judgment of the reasons for that condition.</p>
<p>But the word &#8216;poor&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, does it? That shows how the cultural managers have, over time, conditioned us to feel about things the way they want us to feel about things.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I agree that McIntyre&rsquo;s response was rooted in envy, as is most of the cases when a black assaults a white person. And also, mainstream blacks lack the ability to look long-term, they want instant gratification, they don&rsquo;t care about the future, and this is also shown in big time sports. Who gets all the press? The blacks who have the me before team attitude like Terrell Owens or Kobe Bryant. But the media is by far the biggest instigator and hypocrite in all of this. How many articles do you read where it states that blacks and Hispanics are twice as likely for this, or 5x likely for that disease, or poverty, or more likely to end up in prison, or have a father in jail&hellip; Yet on the next page they&rsquo;ll tell you that we are all created equal, and civil rights was to promote equality. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. </p>
