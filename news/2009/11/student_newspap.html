			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, November 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Lowell High School student newspaper published Friday included an advertisement for a white supremacist Web site, reportedly paid for by a group promoting a &#8220;campaign to inform, awaken and radicalize our White American youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site, www.victoryforever.com, features &#8220;white resistance music&#8221; as well as T-shirts, stickers and links to similar sites.</p>
<p>The ad in The Lowell said &#8220;Free Music Downloads&#8221; and included the Web site address in a small box below an Arby&rsquo;s ad inside the paper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The contents of the online site caught school officials by surprise. They pulled all remaining copies of the paper and won&rsquo;t be mailing out subscription copies, said district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It appears as if the ad&rsquo;s creators attempted to deceive school faculty and students. The Web link in the ad looked dramatically different Friday than it did prior to when the ad ran.</p>
<p>Internet records show that on Nov. 4 the Web site included an innocuous page offering music by independent artists, including an African American man, and links for music that went nowhere. There was no hint of white supremacist views.</p>
<p>That cached version was removed from Internet archives late Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The newspaper&rsquo;s two faculty advisers said they took the &#8220;deceptive and misleading&#8221; ad at face value and never checked the Web site, Blythe said.</p>

		<p>White-supremacist sounds a bit brash. Why not use the term &#8220;White Seperatists&#8221;? It sounds more like a bunch of folk who just want to mind their own business. If the world thinks we&rsquo;re supreme, that&rsquo;s O.K.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, BlackPlanet, with links to The Nation of Islam, on the front page, is one of the busiest web-sites on the internet. And kids learn in school about how great, and important The Black Panthers are. I suppose it&rsquo;s a hate crime of some kind saying they are not. Not that I can really keep up. </p>

		<p>It looks like the site is indeed run by folks who could be called &#8220;supremacists&#8221;. But as we so often say, who are the real supremacists? Us and people like us who acknowledge that humans have an innate desire to be with people like them and don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with that? Or the people who see race in every aspect of human life and want everything integrated even against people&rsquo;s wills? Angry music and offensive symbols are either just for fun or something kids will outgrow. If it helps them to be racially conscious whites in the end than it is fine by me.</p>

		<p>This only shows how incredibly stupid our adversaries are. Just like the one guy said in the video. The news is giving us free advertisement.</p>
<p>The liberal commies have got the upper hand right now, but there is a certain movement within the White population now. They are slowly coming out of their slumber and I think the people who hate America and White people are starting to get a little nervous. They certainly have a right to feel that way. They know that if Americans start asking questions, their lousy game is up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If they had seen what it is, they would have worked with their student editors and made the determination that it was not appropriate content for the paper,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are appalled.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just jumping at the chance to say how much they hate whites. It also sounds like the faculty advisors wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8216;working&rsquo; with student editors so much as telling them what to print. </p>
<p>From the rest of the article, &#8220;San Francisco was selected because it has long suffered the ravages of liberal insanity, vile degeneracy and criminal vicitmization of it&rsquo;s citzens by the very &#8216;diverse&rsquo; populations it seeks to embrace,&#8221; according to an e-mail sent separately to The Chronicle.</p>
<p>By ending the article there, isn&rsquo;t the San Francisco Chronicle in a sense &#8216;supporting&rsquo; &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>If they pull all the copies of the paper and refuse to run the ad, the website operators might be able to sue them for breach of contract.  Advertisers in school newspapers generally sign contracts with the paper.</p>

		<p>Kyle: &#8220;&hellip;we are going to have to start denouncing the morons that create this garbarge.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a problem with that. So-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; love to denounce everybody who is not conservative in exactly the same way as they are.  Remember Michael Savage&rsquo;s response to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s offer to appear on his show?  The twerp threatened to sic the FBI on him.  </p>
<p>The result is, there&rsquo;s no coherent resistance to the diversity onslaught.</p>
<p>When you denounce people who are more militantly pro-white than you are, you are doing the liberals&rsquo; work for them.  You don&rsquo;t do anything for the principle of free speech.  You discourage others from speaking up.  Disagree with them by all means, if you have a valid argument against their views. But if all you have to offer is &#8220;That&rsquo;s racist! You&rsquo;re vile!&#8221;, rather just be quiet.</p>
<p>The white race is in a struggle for survival.  We can&rsquo;t afford to savage each other.  These groups may recruit members who are not open to your views; it&rsquo;s all to the good. When the fit hits the shan, they will be fighting for white survival, not against it.</p>
<p>Remember, my enemy&rsquo;s enemy is my friend.  Even if I don&rsquo;t like him.</p>

<p>Makes me think of something the SPLC or NAACP would do so they could proudly report on the HUGE amount of &#8216;white racists&rsquo; threatening the country. </p>

		<p>Very interesting posts,</p>
<p>I agree that the website is quite harsh and juvenile. However, at this point in time, we shouldn&rsquo;t worry about such things. If they&rsquo;re with us, they&rsquo;re with us. Those who are against this nation and the White race don&rsquo;t care how horrendous their propaganda is that vilifies us, so don&rsquo;t worry how horrendous the propaganda on our side. It&rsquo;s too late for nicyties. </p>
<p>The website gives good links as well, including Amren. If a person starts looking through the links, and comes across Amren, he&rsquo;ll/she&rsquo;ll become a supporter of ours. Actually, if anybody goes ahead and enters the website at all, there&rsquo;s something in them that isn&rsquo;t happy with the status quo.</p>
<p>Like I said in my last post on this subject, White people are starting to awaken. </p>

		<p>Gee, we can have La Raza &#8220;supremacist&#8221; websites, Black &#8220;supremacist&#8221; websites, and all other nonwhite sites, but heaven forbid there are any that promote and defend the White race!  I am sick of the continuing onslaught against anything White! Maybe some of it is crass according to a couple of posters here, but so what? Have you ever gone to some of the NONwhite websites and seen just what crass and hatred really looks like? </p>

		<p>&#8220;An anonymous e-mail containing several misspellings and grammatical errors reportedly from the Web site&rsquo;s authors sent to local media said the advertisements were placed in student newspapers across the country to appear Friday and would be running through next week &#8220;and in the future.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Notice how the Chronicle reporter, Jill Tucker, takes great pains to point out that the website&rsquo;s authors use poor grammar.  She does this in a sentence which is itself a stunning example of poor grammar (no commas where they are needed, leading to subject confusion).<br>

<p>If that liberal idiots didnt make a case even from this, I surelly wouldnt have found those books in pdf. Youst look on the bottom at the victoryforever page. You will found many interresting and some not so interresting books concerning the white race. Now that the pdfs are for free, I can sent them to many english speaking friends to educate themselves. </p>

		<p>Posters who slam the vulgarity of some White activists are the counterproductive ones.  So what if Whites are furious that their government betrays them at every turn, their teachers are mostly liars, every media outlet tells them they&rsquo;re evil, and they&rsquo;re expected to like it when White girls defile themselves with Blacks?  Many of us here use the word &#8220;treason&#8221; to describe the multi-cultis.  Ought we be surprised that some people openly say what should be done with traitors?  Will we build a White Nationalist movement entirely with thoughtful, patient, well-spoken people?  Who fights in the ranks of revolutionary armies?  Did Thomas Jefferson ever pin a Redcoat to the ground with a bayonet?  Many here expect mass disorder as the non-Whites gain more numbers and power.  Will the emo boys and readers of vampire romance join our fight?  Older, experienced people should guide foolish, reckless young people, not shun them.  </p>

<p>Much of this material comes from different sources as you know the racialist movement is very splintered. My guess is that the SPLC is behind this and will claim that they need donations to combat this stuff. </p>
