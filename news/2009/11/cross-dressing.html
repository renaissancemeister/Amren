<h1><a href="https://www.thegrio.com/2009/11/move-over-tyler-perry-youre.php">Cross-Dressing Comedians Becoming a Drag in Black Films</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Talia Whyte, The Grio, November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Move over, Tyler Perry  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re not the only black actor putting a skirt on for the big screen.</p>
<p>Jamie Foxx and Martin Lawrence are reprising their respective television characters  &mdash;  Sheneneh and Wanda  &mdash;  for an upcoming film of the same name. The movie originated as a parody of a movie trailer for a film called &#8216;Skank Robbers&rsquo; which the actors made for the BET Awards. {snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &#8220;Sheneneh and Wanda&#8221; will also be a box office hit, partly because we, the black community, don&rsquo;t demand better images of ourselves. It is about time we give some shine to the blacks in the film world who are trying to make a difference. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about the need to stop complaining about folks like Tyler Perry, who many believe is contributing to the negative black portrayals, and put our collective energy into supporting better portrayals of blacks in the media.</p>
<p>Lee Daniels&rsquo; movie &#8220;Precious&#8221; looks like a step in the right direction, but there are other initiatives out there by other black filmmakers that should also receive recognition. Recently, I spoke to Atlanta filmmaker Tre Whitlow. His latest film  &mdash;  &#8220;Black To Our Roots&#8221;  &mdash;  is an inspiring documentary about an African-American teenage girl who goes to Ghana and challenges what she knows about her African roots. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And there are other black filmmakers like him, including Byron Hurt, director of the controversial film Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, which delves into the issues of sexism, homophobia and violence in today&rsquo;s hip-hop scene. At the time of its release, the film sparked new debates in our community about issues that have usually been discussed behind closed doors for years. Hurt&rsquo;s other movies, including &#8220;Barack &amp; Curtis&#8221; and &#8220;I Am a Man&#8221; explore issues relating to black masculinity while his current project  &mdash;  &#8220;Soul Food Junkies&#8221;  &mdash;  looks at obesity within the black community.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to the growing trend of dressing in drag while black in Hollywood, but unfortunately, many of these kinds of positive black films never get the audiences they deserve due to a lack of funding from powerful Hollywood brokers or most important, support from the black community.</p>
<p>If we really want to see change in how we are portrayed in Hollywood, we also need to be the change we want to see through our actions  &mdash;  and movie viewing habits.</p>

		<p>Spike Lee makes movies that, I&rsquo;m told, express the real Black experience.  I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of them but I must be missing something.  My reaction was not sympathy for the plight of the characters, but disdain for a bunch of losers who won&rsquo;t help themselves.  Perhaps if I had seen all the troubles as Whitey&rsquo;s fault in the first place, the movies would have made sense.  As it was, they looked like recruiting films for AmRen.  </p>

<p>Reality, is the perfect recruiting tool for AmRen. That&rsquo;s why the good folks must work so hard sweeping real experience under a rug while promoting a false reality as true. </p>

This is actually a major bone of contention in the black community today.</p>
<p>Spike Lee has publicly trashed Tyler Perry for doing drag.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong undercurrent of black males who don&rsquo;t like seeing black men wearing dresses, even for comic affect.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with schoolteacher. I saw do the right thing. I consider it a documentary on how blacks drive honest businesses out of their community.</p>

		<p>So now we are to lay the blame for black underachievement on black cross-dressing comedians.  For decades, the movies have presented positive models of black people, most often in films where many or most of the characters were white.  These movies were made for racially diverse audiences, and many were extremely popular.  And there have been a number of uplifting films where most of the cast was black.<br>
I&rsquo;ve read that about 30% of modern movie audiences is black, so naturally moviemakers cater quite often to them.  And black folks definitely like comedies like those created by Tyler Perry.<br>
All the bad elements of ghetto culture, like filthy, degrading songs and glamourization of crime, are reflections of reality and not the root cause of the problems.  And, of course, if politically powerful blacks put real pressure on the purveyors of rap music, it could be greatly quashed.  All we get is an occasional half-baked condemnation from Jackson or Sharpton.</p>

		<p>Goof ball losers do not want to be shown what lazy creeps they really are. They want to be entertained with rappers, clowns, and killers doing the perp dance. Movies that envoke racial pride like&#8221; Malcom X &#8221; don`t make a dime but &#8221; Do the Right Thing,&#8221; and &#8221; Boys in the Hood,&#8221; made a bundle. Watching thugs socking it to the white man for any reason puts black rear ends in seats along with liberal whites. Challenging blacks to behave, study, and stay with their own kind are snoozers for losers.<br>

		<p>Most black film makers are pretty much unknown outside of the black community. They probably make the kinds of movies that put food on the table and appeal to black audiences. If blacks wish to view themselves as clowns, so be it. Most films that portray blacks in a positive or realistic light are made by whites. &#8220;Bird&#8221; for example was made by Clint Eastwood. I&rsquo;ve seen &#8220;Bamboozled&#8221;, &#8220;Summer of Sam&#8221;, and &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221;; while I personally couldn&rsquo;t care less for Spike Lee, he holds his own in the craft of film making.  </p>
<p>If the FCC allowed this, here is what your commercials would look like on shows that appeal to minorities (sports excluded).</p>
