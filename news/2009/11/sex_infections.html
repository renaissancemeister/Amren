<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091116/NEWS-US-SEX-DISEASES-USA/">Sex Infections Still Growing in U.S., Says CDC</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maggie Fox, Reuters, November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>American squeamishness about talking about sex has helped keep common sexually transmitted infections far too common, especially among vulnerable teens, U.S. researchers reported Monday.</p>
<p>Latest statistics on chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis show the three highly treatable infections continue to spread in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SOARING RATES</p>
<p>The CDC&rsquo;s latest study on STDs found:</p>
<p>* 1.2 million cases of chlamydia were reported in 2008, up from 1.1 million in 2007.</p>
<p>* Nearly 337,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported.</p>
<p>* Adolescent girls 15 to 19 years had the most chlamydia and gonorrhea cases of any age group at 409,531.</p>
<p>* Blacks, who represent 12 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 71 percent of reported gonorrhea cases and almost half of all chlamydia and syphilis cases in 2008.</p>
<p>* Black women 15 to 19 had the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea.</p>
<p>* 13,500 syphilis cases were reported in 2008, an almost 18 percent increase from 2007.</p>
<p>* 63 percent of syphilis cases were among men who have sex with men.</p>
<p>* Syphilis rates among women increased 36 percent from 2007 to 2008.</p>
<p>Syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea can all be treated with antibiotics but untreated can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy and can infect newborns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, black Americans need to understand their risks. Douglas said high rates of incarceration of men in many black communities meant fewer men have sex with more women, in turn often spreading sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Overall, CDC estimates that 19 million new sexually transmitted infections occur each year, almost half among 15- to 24-year-olds.<br>

		<p>This study is not at all surprising. Blacks have by far the highest rates of promiscuity so it is only natural that they would have the highest rates of STD&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s ironic that the full article talks about &#8220;vulnerable teens.&#8221; Presumably those are teens who have frequent, indiscriminate sex. Maybe &#8220;foolish teens&#8221; would have been a better way to put it.</p>
<p> And with the sky-high rates of STDs among blacks, you would have thought the writer would have put that in the lead. Twelve percent of the population and 71 percent of gonorrhea cases? And almost half of all chlamydia and syphilis cases? But of course, the writer refers to blacks, not as amoral sensualists, but as being &#8220;at risk&#8221;. Always must paint the blacks as victims, mustn&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out some more statistics on STDs and minorities:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, (NHANES III) the prevalence of [type 2 genital herpes] among race and gender is 20% in white women, 15% in white men, 55% in black women, and 35% in black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The American Cancer Society reports that cervical cancer [70% of cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV] occurs most often in Hispanic women, yet black women die more often than any other race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Americans account for more HIV and AIDS cases, people estimated to be living with AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group in the U.S. Today, black Americans make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population, but account for half of all new AIDS cases.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks, who represent 12 percent of the U.S. population</p>
<p>Its even worse than this.  If you eliminate Blacks under 10 and over 60 and others not sexual active its probably only 8% or less of the total U.S. population that have these high rates of STDs.  That means the rate of infection among Blacks that are sexual active is astronomical.  Its the same with crime statistics.  Black males aged 14-55 only make up 3% of the total U.S. population and they commit over 60% of the rapes, robberies, and murder.</p>

		<p>If interracial relationships are as common as many seem to think; then can someone explain to me why there is such an imbalance in STD rates?  My guess is that a relatively small percentage of white women are engaging in sexual relationships almost exclusively with black men, thus, not passing those infections onto white men.  If you remove these women from the calculations, the disparity between white and black infection rates is probably much more dramatic.</p>

		<p>In other words, white heterosexuals and white lesbians who stick to partners of their own race are at much lower risk for STDs. </p>

		<p>A few years ago, Marion County Indiana (Indianapolis) led the nation in syphilis morbidity and the percentage of new cases. Even Allen County, IN (Fort Wayne) didn&rsquo;t register more than five cases (Allen is the second in population behind Marion). Nothing really surprising here. </p>

		<p>Just the other day I saw a news article on STDs among blacks which explained that the higher black rate is due to more black men being incarcerated, leaving the remaining black men outside prison with a larger pool of willing partners and therefore resulting in higher STD rates.  Since black men are frequently portrayed as being incarcerated at a higher rate as a result of racism, this seems a plausible-sounding, if flawed, argument to blame higher black STD rates on whites as well.  </p>
<p>It must follow that in Haiti, where there are no evil white racists to throw the downtrodden black men in jail, STD prevalence is relatively low.</p>

		<p>Also notice that the article blames America&rsquo;s squeamishness about talking about sex.  Huh!?! It makes you want to check to see if the piece was written in 1950!  <br>
I once heard of a ghetto girl who refused to use contraceptive cream because &#8220;I&rsquo;m not gonna stick that stuff up in me!&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think I have to add to that.<br>
Most girls and women do care whether they get one of these disgusting, sometimes incurable, sometimes fatal diseases.  Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll stop and think then about having sex with some of the low-lifes they tumble into bed with.</p>

		<p>What was curiously not mentioned by the CDC is that the infection rate of genital herpes among blacks is also the highest in the US.  Since herpes causes open sores to form, this can only make it easier to contract and/or spread other sorts of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect condom use to become widespread among blacks, either.  Blacks are insulated from one of the major consequences of their sexual promiscuity - pregnancy - by the welfare state which forces taxpaying white wageearners to pay for the upkeep of the resulting illegitimate children.  With absolutely no financial disincentive to unprotected sex, and a complete unwillingness and inability to think about STDs before jumping into bed with chance-acquaintences, the STD rate among them will remain sky-high.</p>
<p>America is anything but &#8220;squeamish&#8221; about discussing sex; the media continually bombards the public with sexually-charged messages of every sort.  What planet this Douglas character has been living on for the last 30 years?  One must wonder whether or when the government will begin attempting to find personnel with genuine professional qualifications to fill positions like his, rather than merely appointing hacks with the correct political connections.  I&rsquo;m not going to hold my breath while I wait.</p>

<p>The lefties use this canard all the time when their favorite racial minorities have too many STDs and VDs.  They even used it when Bristol Palin was expecting   &mdash;   that she didn&rsquo;t know that sex leads to pregnancy.  (Meanwhile, they cover up the fact that until whites arrived, Australian Aboriginals didn&rsquo;t know that.)  </p>
<p>Bristol Palin was 17 years old and in probably the least inhibitious society in history, plus she had the internet for just about all her conscious lifetime.  She knew.  Even pre-internet, it was easy to find out; I happened upon one of those &#8220;booklets&#8221; and educated myself when I was 10 years old, and figured that this was something I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be reading.  It was a few months after that that my uncle gave me the official &#8220;talk,&#8221; and even then he didn&rsquo;t tell me everything I already knew   &mdash;   I deduced that what was left out was for me to find out later and on my own, though I already knew it.</p>
<p>Plain words, the excuse is a dog that doesn&rsquo;t hunt for me.</p>

They&rsquo;re squeamish about talking and hearing about CONSEQUENCES of irresponsible behavior. Here in central MD we&rsquo;re surrounded on two sides by the two HIV/AIDS champion cities of the world. Baltimore was #1 until recently DC claimed that &#8220;honor.&#8221; Clearly people just haven&rsquo;t learned that sex with a virgin cures HIV.  </p>

		<p>This largely boils down to females once again not standing up for their rights.  For instance, men carry chlamydia from one willing black teenage girl to the next.  With swagger and self-confidence that his actions have no result.  He will move from girl to girl who  will have unprotected sex.  She gets a baby to care for   &mdash;   never expects to see him again.  State and county hospitals care for the baby, until grandma takes over.  She then goes back to copulating with the next string of young black boys with saggy pants and STDs to share.  </p>
<p>sorry, but this is not a white issue, its a female self respect issue.  and boys, get a job, an eduction and grow up.  </p>
