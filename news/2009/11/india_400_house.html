			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mritunjay, BrooWaha, November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the central government and the state governments were trying to negotiate the return of more than 30,000 Internally Displaced People (IDP) from the North-Eastern state of Mizoram, killing of a Mizo</p>
<p>Ethnic tension has spiraled up in India&rsquo;s North-Eastern state of Mizoram after a Mizo youth named Zarzokima, aged 18, was murdered by the by militants belonging to the Bru National Army. Since then suspected Mizo groups have burnt down nearly 400 houses belonging to Bru people. Thatch and bamboo is used as the primary roofing material for houses in these tribal areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mizoram government on Monday issued a shoot-on-sight order at Bungthuam and neighbouring villages in the state&rsquo;s western parts, which have been on the boil following last week&rsquo;s murder of a Mizo youth allegedly by suspected Bru militants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shoot-on-sight order has been issued to contain the ethnic strife at Bru-dominated villages in the Bungthuam area near the state&rsquo;s border with Tripura,&#8221; Mizoram home minister R Lalzirliana said here. (Source: timesofindia.indiatimes.com)</p>
<p>Fearing backlash, as many as 300 Bru families in these areas have already crossed over to neighboring Tripura since the time the first arson was reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The history of clashes between Bru tribes and Mizos is not new. In fact after a major strife in 1997-98, the Brus had created the militant front called Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM). The bloody strife was expected to end when 802 militants of BLFM had surrendered in October 2006. The mass surrender followed an agreement reached between the Indian government and the Bru rebels in 2005 after the central government announced a financial package of Rs. 286.5 million for the repatriation of the tribal refugees from Tripura to Mizoram.</p>
<p>The state government has been in the process of making elaborate plans to repatriate over 35,000 Bru refugees since then who had escaped to Tripura after the strife first broke out in 1997. Meanwhile political leaders from the Reang community are busy fishing in the troubled waters.</p>
<p>The tripartite meeting held in Aizawl Nov 4 between representatives of the central and Mizoram governments and tribal refugees failed to resolve the 12-year deadlock to repatriate 35,000 Reang migrants from Tripura to Mizoram.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly 30 militant groups operate in North East India and these struggles have left more than 50,000 dead in six of the seven North East states since 1947 when India got her independence. The demand of such groups ranges from creation of autonomous regions to right of self-determination.</p>

		<p>These tribal groups are now likely making the case that they should be admitted to the U.S. as asylum seekers.  Think they haven&rsquo;t got a chance?  Do you know that the U.S. has comitted to taking in 3% of the population of Bhutan?  Thousands have already arrived under the aegis of various church and other groups, that run the refugee/asylum racket as a lucrative business.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple: Transfer the 35,000 Reang  migrants from Tripura to the U.S. Prez. Obama will settle them within White communitees that need deversification. All parties will benefit. </p>

		<p>India is not one country like China is. Its a federation of dozens of states each with its own ethnic group. It wasn&rsquo;t one entity until The British Raj. Before the Raj most of it was dominated by the Islamic Mughal Empire. The ethnic hatreds there are very old. As its population continues to increase exponentially the ethnic conflicts will only get worse. <br>
In other words, be ready for an unending flow of immigrants from India. </p>

		<p>These people from the North Eastern states of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh etc&hellip;should not be in India at all. They have nothing in common with India and want freedom but India will not give it. I believe the Indian government forced the kings of these lands to join India in some cases even imprisoning invited monarchs unless they sign the dotted line. Besides Bangladeshis and other Indians like Biharis who breed like flies are on their way to outbreed the natives and change the demographics permanently. India attacked a free kingdom called Sikkim and annexed it. For the people here, India is like a colonial power. But I forgot only Whites can invade others, only Whites can have imperialist tendencies. Maybe this is the fate of the British people when they are outbred by Bangladeshis, Indians and blacks in the Britain of tomorrow.</p>

		<p>To Jasper:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, in 1961, India forcibly annexed the tiny Portuguese enclaves of Goa, Diu and Damao. It also has had offshore disputes with Bangladesh, and of course, conflicts with Pakistan, all over diputed territory - except the war over Bangladesh&rsquo;s independence in 1971.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Classical anthropology often placed [Indians] in the same taxonomic group as Europeans and designated them both as Caucasoids. But modern genetic studies, such as those by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, show the [Indians] are a surprisingly distinct &#8220;genetic cluster&#8221;. They can be distinguished from Europeans to their north as well as from sub-Saharan Africans to their south and the other Asian groups to their east.&#8221;</p>
