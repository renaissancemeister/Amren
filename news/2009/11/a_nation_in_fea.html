			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruth Dudley Edwards, Independent (Dublin), November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THERE&rsquo;S a climate of fear in the US among the military, law-enforcers, policy-makers, the media, opinion-formers and many ordinary citizens. A major cause is the intimidating Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which is dedicated to Muslim empowerment, receives substantial funding from Arab governments and has been accused by federal prosecutors of funnelling money to Hamas.</p>
<p>So effective and ruthless is CAIR that anyone in authority worries before doing anything that can be misrepresented as anti-Muslim and lead to lawsuits citing religious or racial discrimination.</p>
<p>There were plenty of people who might have prevented the psychiatrist Major Nidal Malik Hasan from murdering 12 soldiers and a policeman, but were too scared to do so. FBI operatives, for instance, knew he was exchanging chummy emails with the al Qaeda supporter Anwar al Awlaki, who had been an imam at a Virginia mosque which Hasan attended and who fled to the Yemen after 9/11 because the FBI were investigating his close links with two of the hijackers.</p>
<p>There were the fellow-worshippers at the Muslim Community Centre in Maryland who were perturbed by Hasan&rsquo;s hatred of his country, his rigid Islamic fundamentalism and his insistence that jihad was not about inner spiritual struggle but the killing of those who were a threat to Islam.</p>
<p>Then there were the senior army doctors who 18 months ago sat through a long PowerPoint presentation from Hasan called The Koranic world view as it relates to Muslims in the US Military, in which he called for Muslims to be released from the army as conscientious objectors rather than fight against their co-religionists; he explained that &#8220;fighting to establish an Islamic state to please Allah, even by force, is condoned by Islam&#8221;. After worried discussions, nothing happened. Army psychiatrists concerned about Hasan&rsquo;s increasing preoccupation with religion and war sent him to a university lecture series on Islam and the Middle East .</p>
<p>And how has the army responded to the massacre?</p>
<p>&#8220;As horrific as this tragedy was,&#8221; said the Chief of Staff General George Casey, &#8220;if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&rsquo;s worse.&#8221; Well, I don&rsquo;t think the relatives of the dead are likely to agree. Worship of diversity, fundamentalist political correctness and terror of being accused of Islamphobia has obscured the simple truth that the US army is no place for anyone who believes the Koran should be interpreted literally.</p>
<p>Commentators sought PC reasons for Hasan&rsquo;s homicidal spree. He had had a breakdown because of the dreadful stories his work required him to listen to: this was probably, said one, a &#8220;seemingly disproportionate response&#8221; to anti-Muslim comments from colleagues and tales of bad things that had happened to Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan. That he was being sent to Afghanistan, was scared and just wanted to get out of the army was a common view.</p>
<p>Sadly, despite President Obama&rsquo;s claim that what happened at Fort Hood was &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221;, it&rsquo;s easy to understand: the accumulated evidence is that Hasan was an Islamist fruitcake who swallowed the whole, unexpurgated and unmodernised Koran, right down to the paradise that awaits those who kill and are killed for Allah, which is why he was shouting Allahu Akbar (&#8216;God is great&rsquo;) as he shot his comrades.</p>
<p>There have been other dodgy Muslim fundamentalists in the United States army, including Sergeant Hasan Karim Akbar, who in 2003 murdered two soldiers and wounded 14, but  &mdash;  with CAIR in mind  &mdash;  the army continues to run from anything that can be described as religious profiling.</p>
<p>A good example of how CAIR has put the fear of Allah into American society is the case of the flying imams. Three years ago, at Minneapolis airport, some passengers and crew on US Airways Flight 300 were alarmed by six imams whose suspicious behaviour included praying loudly, changing seats and two of them demanding seatbelt extensions which they did not use; an Arabic-speaker on the flight heard two of them mention Osama bin Laden and condemn America for &#8220;killing Saddam&#8221;. They were removed from the flight by airport police, detained, questioned and released.</p>
<p>CAIR backed the imams&rsquo; claim that they had suffered from religious discrimination and underwrote their lawsuits against the airline, the law-enforcers and unnamed passengers who had reported them to the crew. Congress banned the suing of airline passengers who report on suspicious activity, but after a bizarre judicial ruling that no competent law enforcer could have thought their treatment reasonable, the airline and the law-enforcers settled out of court last month. The consequences for airline security are terrifying.</p>
<p>Rather surprisingly, a few days ago the American government had the guts to seize mosques and property owned by a group it claims are a front for the Iranian government. This, said CAIR ominously, &#8220;may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope is that it may send the positive message that enough is enough.<br>

		<p>This is something for which the Cold War did not prepare us&hellip; a totalitarian ideology that claims God is on its side and hence that it&rsquo;s protected as a religion.</p>
<p>What Islam Isn&rsquo;t  By: Dr. Peter Hammond<br>
FrontPageMagazine.com | Monday, April 21, 2008</p>
<p>Islam is not a religion nor is it a cult. It is a complete system.  Islam has religious, legal, political, economic and military components. The religious component is a beard for all the other components.  Islamization occurs when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their so-called &#8216;religious rights.&rsquo;  When politically correct and culturally diverse societies agree to &#8216;the reasonable&rsquo; Muslim demands for their &#8216;religious rights,&rsquo; they also get the other components under the table. </p>

		<p> How true that sometimes an outsider can see things about our country that we&rsquo;re too close to see for ourselves. Of course, in this case, literally millions of Americans know that the Obamaists&rsquo; handling of the matter of Muslim terrorism in general and Nidal Hasan&rsquo;s case in particular is addle-pated, wrong-headed, and pernicious. The trouble is, there seems to be nothing we can do about it except fume and denounce.</p>
<p> The liberals and multi-cultis were determined that we were going to have our first African American president last year. Now I hope they&rsquo;re satisfied with their incompetent, untrustworthy windbag.</p>

		<p>Now, really, this has got to stop!!  It is abundantly clear that Islam is a clear and present danger to this nation, because its most extreme adherents murder both &#8220;infidels&#8221; and Muslims who won&rsquo;t go along with the jihadists.  We don&rsquo;t need that here.  We need to state these facts clearly and unequivocally, and then get about the business of sending all Muslims OUT of this country to wherever they choose to go, as long as it isn&rsquo;t here.  We don&rsquo;t need Islam in the USA.  It has produced far more harm than good.  We need to get rid of it before we become its prisoner, like Germany, France, and England.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just plain fear of Muslims - who are in fact dangerous as events have shown. How far this fear goes and how it indicates how much Islam is so incompatible with the USA freedoms &amp; values can be seen by the way it has affected literature and the arts, even film:</p>

<p>Islam just does not belong in the West. It&rsquo;s a nightmare of a religion that generates assassins over what westerners would call just free expressions.</p>

		<p>Intimidation and terrorism have gotten Muslims far, starting with the Muslim Conquest.  They know how to strike fear in our hearts. And you can count on them acting on their threats, they don&rsquo;t bluff. They showed that on 9/11.  As they say, &#8220;you want to live, we want to die.&#8221; How many of us are going to have the cojones to tell them to buzz off, back to where they came from? To say we need to admit them because most Muslims are peace-loving doesn&rsquo;t fly. The &#8220;good&#8221; Muslims provide cover and sanctuary for the bad ones.<br>
The security of the American people must come first.  But try to tell Washington that.</p>

		<p>This seems to be a somewhat new method of attack, I&rsquo;ve noticed it a lot recently. Anyone who objects to their country being flooded by immigrants and &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; from the most dysfunctional and unattractive countries on earth is accused of &#8216;fearing&rsquo; people different from themselves. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t &#8216;fear&rsquo; Muslims, I simply don&rsquo;t much like them. I don&rsquo;t wish to live with them or see their mosques and burkhas in my street. I&rsquo;m not interested in their culture and customs and I don&rsquo;t see what we could possibly learn from them. Blind obedience to &#8216;clerics&rsquo; who claim that Islam is the only acceptable form of belief and that Allah thinks it&rsquo;s ok for those who disagree to be killed? Rigid conformity to superstitious customs and values? </p>
<p>How I wish they would all leave us alone.</p>

		<p>I posted this in mainstream media:</p>
<p>Our country finds itself in a real pickle.</p>
<p>Our commitment (not mine, personally) to multiculturalism means that our country&rsquo;s survival depends on doing everything possible to divert any animosity of one group toward another,* no matter what the overall effect on our country of a particular group may be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re commanded by current ideology as well as by our personal feelings of fair play to treat every individual as an individual, regardless of the effect on our country of certain group loyalties those individuals may hold.</p>
<p>At the same time, our country&rsquo;s survival clearly also depends on somehow overcoming the high frequency of anti-American feeling and action that occurs in groups who retain loyalties that are inimical to the interests of America.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s sometimes not clearly understood is that the retention of such loyalties is an intrinsic part of the ideology of multiculturalism, because multiculturalism is not just the flinging open of the doors of America to people of all ethnicities, it&rsquo;s an ideology that encourages the newcomers to regard America as nothing more than a container for the cultural views and practices they arrive with, and which they are encouraged to continue celebrating with an exclusionary pumped-up pride.</p>
<p>The ideology of multiculturalism is very different from the ideology of assimilation that ruled in former years.</p>
<p>If we continue to embrace multiculturalism, or even if we regain some sanity and attempt to assimilate unassimilable peoples, I see only a worsening of our quandary.</p>
<p>*Such measures include the steadily stricter &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws we are now living under, and the &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws that will eventually follow them, as has happened in Europe and elsewhere, and which stifle even public discussion of immigration under penalty of fine and imprisonment.</p>

		<p>Since radical Muslims, willing to start a jihad at the drop of a hat, are scattered all over the world, we will never totally win a war in the middle east. We would have to send troops everywhere<br>
to stop their fanatical actions. This problem will continue to grow as long as this country accepts those who want to come here. The mindsets of these people are stronger than honor, patriotism, anyone else&rsquo;s religion or any law of the land. They are terrorists and will never rest until they overcome.</p>

		<p>America is one thing, but I don&rsquo;t see how Europe can let itself be overrun by Muslims.  Have they learned absolutely nothing from history?  Muslims slaughtered and enslaved White people (including women and children) in Europe before the crusades got rid of the menace. Now they are letting them reconquer Europe without a fight?  What has happened to this race?</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a famous comment about &#8220;Islam&rsquo;s bloody borders&#8221; but I cannot remember to whom it is attributed. But true it is; ask a citizen of India, China, Phillipines, or any other country that &#8220;hosts&#8221; this religion and its adherents. Sooner or later, peace becomes a thing of the past. As Lawrence Auster has said, we will be checked on and frisked and photographed FOREVER because our stupid politicians could not bring themselves to act on this issue.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the Political Correctness movement has laid the foundation for demands by Muslims that the behavior of non-Muslims be regulated with perpetually-increasing controls in what heretofore had been free, Western societies.  The Politically-Correct have made a cottage industry of claiming that never being &#8220;offended&#8221; is an absolute right, and that the onus lies on those who while exercising the right to (for example) free speach produce this &#8220;offense&#8221;.  Organizations like CAIR have jumped on this thinking as one of their tools to enforce Dhimmitude on Western citizens who have enjoyed very great - and non-Muslim - freedoms of conscience since the Enlightment.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Politically-Correct will be among the earliest and main victims of Dhimmitude, as Islam is not at all well-disposed to the other liberal-left philosophies espoused by the PC elites.<br>

		<p>Several European countries with large Muslim populations already operate under a sharia-like fear of their Muslim populations, the U.S. fear is minor in comparison.  This is one more article that pretends you can separate Muslim extremism from general Islam.   The problem isn&rsquo;t the shades of their beliefs, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re here at all.  In fact, there is no difference between apologizing for violent imported Islam and apologizing for violent imported (or native, for that matter) non-white criminality, it&rsquo;s all part of the same white-hating racism.  The violence of militant Islam in the West, like the violence of non-white criminals in the West, is just a manifestation of the violence of the policies of dispossession and destruction through mass immigration being waged against the nations and peoples of the West by their criminal elites.  Downplaying the Islamic aspects of the Ft. Hood massacre is a defense of open borders; it&rsquo;s not about not offending Muslims, its about keeping whites from questioning the value of multi-racialism/multiculturalism and mass immigration.   (It&rsquo;s a measure of just how deep the fanatical hatred of whites is among the Leftist elite that they are willing to accept Muslims as allies in their war of extermination against the West and defend even the terrorists among them.)     </p>
