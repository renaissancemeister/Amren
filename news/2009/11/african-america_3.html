<h1>African-Americans Slam Obama in White House Protest</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, November 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Decrying Barack Obama as &#8220;white power in black face,&#8221; hundreds of African-Americans marched on the White House Saturday to protest policies of the first black US president, and demand that he bring US troops home.</p>
<p>More than 200 people gathered for the first public demonstration by African Americans against the Obama administration since his historic inauguration in January, and slammed the president for continuing what they described as Washington&rsquo;s &#8220;imperialist&#8221; agenda around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that Barack Hussein Obama is white power in black face,&#8221; civil rights activist Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the Black is Back coalition which arranged the protest, called into a megaphone as the group marched outside the mansion&rsquo;s gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a tool of our imperialist enemies and we demand our freedom. And we demand that Obama withdraw all the troops from Afghanistan right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Protesters also called for Obama to order troops out of Iraq and to scrap Africom, the controversial year-old United States Africa Command, and demanded &#8220;hands off&#8221; Venezuela and ends to the Cuba embargo and the Zimbabwe blockade.</p>
<p>Several demonstrators held up placards bearing messages such as &#8220;US out of Afghanistan&#8221; and &#8220;Stop US war against Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Baron, a New York city councilman and former member of the Black Panthers, a Black Power movement in the mid-1960s and 1970s, attacked the president for turning a cold shoulder to the plight of African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not satisfied with him, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this hope and change rap has not been a reality for black people,&#8221; Baron told AFP during the demonstration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are glad that Barack Obama broke up the white male monopoly on the White House, but we were not looking for a change in the occupant of the White House from white to black, we were looking for change in foreign policies and domestic policies,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have a black person exploiting me just like a white person, that&rsquo;s no easier pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group also was calling for the release of former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in 1982 of killing a white police officer and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The US Supreme Court upheld Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s conviction in April and rejected his bid for a new trial.</p>
<p>Black Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democrat Obama in last year&rsquo;s election, when he defeated Republican Senator John McCain.</p>
<p>About 13 percent of US citizens are African-Americans.<br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they demand unconditional amnesty for Joanne Chesimard while they&rsquo;re at it?<br>
Better yet, they should STFU and kiss the ground they walk on and thank God they live here in America and not in Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe, where they would get &#8220;necklaced&#8221; for protesting in the streets&hellip;</p>

		<p>LOL.  They all believed the fairy tale Obama and his supporters made up before the election and they&rsquo;re upset to realize he&rsquo;s just another regular human being.  Yet they&rsquo;re still going to vote for Obama in 2012, because Democrats know that they can always count on the black vote, no matter what.  They&rsquo;d be cute, if not for the crime problem. </p>
<p>Hey, at least these protesters are making valid points, unlike the knee jerk &#8220;everything&rsquo;s different now!&#8221; liberals on TV who always agree with Obama no matter what, even when he contradicts himself.  </p>

		<p>I have a solution to your problem, Mr. Baron and Mr. Yeshiela (deliberate misspelling, because the one letter I took out means that there&rsquo;s a cuss word in the middle of his name.)  In 2012, boycott the elections of said &#8220;white imperialist power structure,&#8221; so that the blackfaced white power President can get voted out of office.  That&rsquo;ll show &#8216;em.</p>

		<p>I love it! I hope there are more and more protests like this. Unfortunately, 200 demonstrators isn&rsquo;t very many. But it is a start.</p>
<p>I actually expected many more black protests against Obama by those demanding that he take immediate action on reparations. Maybe it will still happen.</p>

		<p>Can someone tell me when the &#8220;White is back&#8221; coalition is going to have their protest at the White House! This Charles Baron is a racist mental case. Did anyone ask him how much &#8220;hope and change&#8221; HE has brought to his district, as I believe he&rsquo;s been in there awhile - an east coast Maxine Waters so to speak. Here he is, a NYC councilman, and he claims to be &#8220;exploited&#8221;. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.  </p>

<p>The &#8220;plight&#8221; of black Americans is a lack of ability and intelligence.</p>
<p>Did they expect to become more competent and smarter with a black as president?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh.  That could well be absolute fact.  Remember the black lady who was cheering Obama&rsquo;s win in the election, saying that now she would get her mortgage paid for and a new car?</p>
<p>Mmmm   mmmm   mmm:  Barack Hussein Obama</p>

<p>Today is November 09, 2009. <br>
So we could have set our watches a year ago in anticipation of the preceeding manifesto. And what, pray tell do these nimrods propose to do with the newly returned Mideast theatre troops?? Put them in Community Colleges under the GI bill to teach them advanced hairbraiding skills?</p>

		<p>Obama, &ldquo;white power in black face&rdquo;?</p>
<p>What the hell are they talking about? He is implementing a health care reform that will disproportionnately benefit non-Whites. And he hasn&rsquo;t done anything about affirmative action. Plus, manu people on his team are working to give amnesty to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I think if Barack was any more Black and brown power in a half-White face, we would see riots every day. He&rsquo;s pushing as much as he can push, just short of making all Whites angry. </p>

		<p>Sounds like a bunch of commies to me. And the President is not so much a &#8220;white power in a black face&#8221; as what used to be called an &#8220;oreo cookie&#8221; [is that term used anymore?] Black man that is &#8220;white&#8221; on the inside. Black man that &#8220;thinks&#8221; and acts white. The President does greatly resemble his white grandfather, if that means anything.</p>

		<p>Well, this was so predictable that a blind man could have seen it coming a mile away. There were a lot of deluded liberals and neocons who claimed that the election of Obama would finally put a stop to blacks&rsquo; incessant complaints about racism. After all, if a country elects a black president, how racist could it possibly be? Those of us familiar with black behavior, however, knew that blacks would simply claim that Obama is an Uncle Tom, not authentically black, and therefore doesn&rsquo;t really count. In fact, we&rsquo;ve seen this whole dog and pony show before, back when Clarence Thomas was appointed to the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Did the racist Charles Barron really say that? All last year he ran around NY chanting &#8220;It&rsquo;s Obama or it&rsquo;s nobody!&#8221; Meaning that he would tell blacks to stay home on election day if Hillary won the nomination.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s claiming Obama winning 95% of the black vote had nothing to do with race?<br>

		<p>The Black Panthers were not a black power movement, they were criminals using politics as a front to keep law enforcement off their backs.</p>
<p>Huey Newton was a pimp, a drug dealer and probably a murderer.</p>
<p>Eldridge Cleaver was a serial rapist and bragged about committing murders.</p>
<p>These protesters are not being exploited in any way.</p>

		<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m surprised. The AmRen readership knew it even the Mainstream Media didn&rsquo;t: America&rsquo;s race problem was not going to magically disappear once Obama was elected. </p>
<p>Because of inherent racial differences there will always be disparities and those disparities will be blamed on whites because they&rsquo;re the only scapegoat blacks have. It makes no difference how kind whites are to them; blacks will still hate them because they can&rsquo;t be like them. </p>
<p>Liberalism has never once breached superficiality and brought the utopia it promised. Reality and human nature always get in the way. The racial turmoil in this country, however masked, will continue and, if left unacknowledged, it can only get worse.</p>

<p>I thought that the game plan was that the day after the election all young Black males would be inspired to go to school that Wednesday morning, pay attention in class, study, stop wandering the hallways, assaulting teachers and copulating in the stairwells. <br>
