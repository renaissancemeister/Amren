<h1><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/ci_13690105?nclick_check=1">Richmond Rape Victim&rsquo;s Family: &#8216;Please Do Not Let This Happen Again&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthias Gafni, Mercury News (San Jose), November 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The parents of the 15-year-old girl gang-raped after a Richmond High School homecoming dance spoke Saturday, pleading for people to &#8220;be courageous in speaking the truth and in holding people accountable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s pastor read a prepared statement during a community meeting in the school&rsquo;s auditorium Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain. We have had enough violence already in this place. If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger into positive action,&#8221; the girl&rsquo;s family wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Work toward changing the atmosphere in our schools and in this community so that this kind of thing never happens again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pastor Jim Wheeler, of First Presbyterian Church of Richmond, shared the comments with a couple hundred concerned parents and community members who congregated to discuss safety and available health and safety programs.</p>
<p>Five people are being held in connection with the Oct. 24 on-campus rape that has shocked Richmond and the nation, although police believe many more watched or participated in the assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wheeler said the girl may make her own statement next week, and for now the family wants its privacy. He&rsquo;s not surprised at the nationwide media attention and public outrage sparked by the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner spoke briefly to the gathering, announcing her office has jump-started the permit process to build the new fence around the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of gang rape is certainly not normal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It rises to our attention how we really need to address the heart of the issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said economic stresses, foreclosures and other combinations may have exacerbated the horrific crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad we have people in this world who can be so generous that they don&rsquo;t plan to call for revenge. I&rsquo;m afraid if I were the parents of this girl, these animals would never see the light of day again. I&rsquo;d like to see them all imprisoned for life. And the cowards who stood by and aided and abetted by not reporting this heinous crime, should have their names and pictures published in the paper so their neighbors and families could see them for what they truly are.Let&rsquo;s hope that if they were ever in trouble, that a passerby would treat them as they treated this girl - by just standing and watching!</p>

<p>This reminds me of the death of River Phoenix when his parents blamed his demise on environmental degradation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly arguing with these types of people on the Buffalo News webpage which has a comments section.</p>
<p>Regardless of how common these types of crimes are in the black community, a majority refuse to blame those responsible while pointing a finger at economics, the Bush years, and society.</p>
<p>I cite statistics from government sources to no avail. I don&rsquo;t know how to get through to people who see reality but make absurd excuses.</p>
<p>This is why I have come to the conclusion that liberalism is a kind of mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality.<br>

<p>I fail to see how houses being foreclosed would lead to Hispanic high school students committing a brutal rape.</p>

<p>Will these poor fools ever learn?</p>
<p>If we break free of this disgusting predicament we&rsquo;re in and obtain sovereignty, we MUST cull those who think like this or we&rsquo;re doomed wherever we go and whatever we create again. </p>

		<p>Who is going to tell black &#8220;leaders&#8221; to stop harping on past slavery and Jim Crow laws and say to them, &#8220;Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain&#8221;?  Have those parents completely missed the point of &#8220;hate-crime&#8221; laws?  The point is that an attack on an individual because of her race, color etc. is actually an attack on all other members of that race, color etc.  It&rsquo;s because it strikes fear into the collective heart of that community.  Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe in &#8220;hate-crime&#8221; laws but this makes me wonder if those parents support them or not.  If they do support &#8220;hate-crime&#8221; laws, this would make them hypocrites.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean hiring a few paleoconservatives on the teaching staff? Schools, and life in general, have certainly gone downhill since there were some in public life. These are just empty words, especially considering how all of their efforts to &#8216;change the atmosphere&rsquo; are working toward creating it.  </p>

		<p>Those who say racism has nothing to do with this, answer this: why did a chiefly hispanic gang of miscreants target a White girl in a place where she is a member of a mere 2% minority? The inaction of the locals who witnessed the atrocity leads me to believe that they were themselves almost entirely non-White and received some twisted satisfaction at the violation and destruction of a White child.</p>
<p>A &#8220;positive action&#8221; to ensure &#8220;that this kind of thing never happens again&#8221; would be to have a nation-wide effort to raise enough funds for the remaining 2% of White children who go to that rotten, monstrous, disgraceful school and ALL White children who are a minority in their OWN schools to move to a place where they can feel safe and be treated as human beings. Something tells me this can only happen in a White majority school/neighborhood.</p>
<p>And trying to prevent &#8220;promoting hatred&#8221; is futile and redundant. The very happening of this crime was itself a loud promotion of hatred to Whites, and an angry hateful response to it would be unavoidable. I am not saying it should be endorsed, but I strongly suspect that there are, to say, LESS articulate people out there who are probably beyond furious about this and are going to express themselves VERY differently than the victim&rsquo;s family does in this article.</p>

<p>If the church pastor was a Christian he would instruct his congregation regarding the lawlessness of rape, in Deuteronomy 22:25-28, and the governments responsibility to punish it, in Romans 13:3-4.  The criminals who committed this crime should be sentenced to death, of which their deeds have declared them more than worthy.  </p>
<p>Anything less will not change the &#8220;atmosphere&#8221;.  America is currently in an &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of lawlessness, criminal malice, depravity and corruption.  A lack of justice by the government always leads to, fosters and encourages more criminal activity.  Until Americans realize this, they will continue to reap it&rsquo;s consequences.</p>
<p>The assemblywoman wants to build new fences around the campus in an attempt to solve problems of moral depravity.  She&rsquo;s as clueless as the pastor.  The heart of the issue is sin, not economic stress and foreclosures. </p>

<p>Now this is just plain stupid. Because of stresses related to the economy, someone decides to participate in a gang rape?</p>
<p>You know the last time I found myself in an economic quagmire I did not decide to go gang rape a women with people of similair economic problems. There is a moral compass that some people do not have and it seems many of these precious minorities entering or being born into this once great country do not have it.</p>

		<p>Richmond is the blackest city in the Bay Area, and has been since I was a kid 50+ years ago.  My aunt and uncle lived there with their two sons, both of whom ended up in prison.  One straightened out, got sober, and lives a good life now.  The other died in the gutter, an addict.  That&rsquo;s the kind of influences that come out of Richmond.  My advice to those parents:  if you want your kid to be safe, get her OUT of Richmond, away from Oakland   &mdash;   even Berkeley is better than either of those hellholes.  Any parent who would let their kid go to school in Richmond is crazy.</p>

<p>Ah, classic. Whenever such crimes are committed by predominantly non-white peoples (I acknowledge that at least one white kid participated in this act), it is always the fault of &#8220;the system.&#8221; Were it not for poverty and lack of opportunities, these kids would be perfect saints, unlike us suburban whites who commit serial killings and child abductions. There is only one problem with the &#8220;blame the system&#8221; argument. White Americans are generally criticized for being too ethnocentric and unwilling to acknowledge that other places in the world even exist. However, white nationalists such as myself and Jared Taylor do know about other places in the world. All I know is that even slum dwellers in Mumbai, India, are far more productive than poor non-whites in the United States. I have visited Mexico several times throughout my life and stayed with families in neighborhoods they regarded as middle class, but would look worse than ghettoes in the United States. The people were very friendly and you didn&rsquo;t see the kind of pathologies displayed by the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; in the United States. While poverty is a factor, problems with culture and values contribute to such barbaric crimes.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable about the Richmond rape is just how un-remarkable it was. Read the news on the internet   &mdash;   stuff like this happens, honestly, every damn day.  Forget the print media &amp; TV; get your news from the net.  Gang rapes are now depressingly common, &amp; almost exclusively by black/brown males.  </p>

		<p>By the sound of the pastor&rsquo;s comments, the victim is white. Only self hating whites would tell the community to not use the incident to promote &#8220;hatred&#8221; or cause &#8220;more pain.&#8221;  Liberal whites have pathologized their own natural instincts for self preservation to such an extent that they are more concerned about avoiding &#8220;hatred&#8221; against minorities than instilling life saving caution in their young people against these criminal blacks and hispanics.  There will surely be no hate crimes charges against the perpetrators.  </p>
<p>Last week a young white boy was set on fire in Florida while the minority boys laughed.  This week a young (probably white) girl is raped to the point of hospitalization.  Who are the &#8220;Real&#8221; racists in this country?  It&rsquo;s not the whites!</p>

		<p>Even in the most horrific circumstances, white spinelessness is ever on parade anymore! This utterly unnatural reaction is proof positve many whites have simply lost the will to survive, to struggle, to thrive. Too many are fully prepared to just give up, to instantly &#8220;forgive,&#8221; to make myriad excuses for why it isn&rsquo;t okay for them to hate, to punish, to get proper revenge!! These are our natural instincts - not all this mealy-mouthed drivel about having, &#8220;had enough violence&#8221; and the like. What has happened to us?? </p>

		<p>This is outrageous. The basic details of this crime are being withheld. The local papers are too afraid to even disclose the basic facts about this crime. Was the victim white? Are whites at this school harassed? Ms. Baker&rsquo;s comments make it appear that she, at least, sees a racial angle here? What race were the attackers? Chiefly Latino? Did they act out of malice towards whites? Was there a white accomplice? Has anyone on the school board or school administration addressed racial tension? Is there racial tension? What is going on here!</p>

At its present rate, this country will lose the battle in the flooding of inferior genes into this country.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got more questions. </p>
<p>What do these students learn in class about white people? Are there ethnic studies classes? If so, what do they learn about Europeans? Are inflammatory movies, such as &#8220;Mississippi Burning&#8221; shown to students? </p>
<p>Is there a chapter of MeCHA on campus? How many members? Were any present during the attack? What about black student organizations? Were any of them there? How many African or Latino only groups are on campus? Are there any white student groups allowed on campus? </p>
<p>Are there campus rallies for black history month? To celebrate Latino culture? Who was invited to speak? What did they say? Did they condemn los anglo sajones? </p>
<p>These are all things that would be examined if it were a Latino or African assaulted at a majority white school. </p>
<p>Since white pride groups are off limits, is there any recognition or support for people of the girl&rsquo;s ethnic background? She&rsquo;s Presbyterian? Is she Scots or Scots-Irish? Is there any support or acknowledgement of that culture? Has it ever been acknowledged? </p>
<p>None of these questions. Not one, however, will be addressed. So why do we think anything will get better? </p>

		<p>Ms. Skinner has a wonderful website where you can post your comments (oppose/support) in a cute little webform.   I would like to submit for your approval my first draft.  I suggest that everyone please write her.  While I&rsquo;m in Southern CA and out of her district (read, &#8216;grasp&rsquo;) I urge other Californians (and members from other states/countries as well - please!) to write her and gracefully ask her to suppose our cause to prevent minority intimidation and racist attacks.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
I am writing in response to the Richmond school incident.  I was extremely disappointed to hear that in the Mercury News article you were mentioned as stating that &#8220;economic stresses, foreclosures and other combinations may have exacerbated the horrific crime.&#8221;  A &#8216;poor economy&rsquo; is not an excuse to rape an underage girl.  It is no more an excuse to GANG rape her. These assailants in their late-teens/early-20s are not going through &#8216;forclosures&rsquo;   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re high school students (or what sounds more like drop-outs or gang members).  She is a double-minority at this school and I find the double-standard being demonstrated here disgusting. We need to be firm that this hate crime will not be tolerated.  I appreciate that the local police department is investigating the possibility of charging the bystanders with participation in this brutal crime.  Putting up a &#8220;new fence&#8221; is not going to solve this problem.  Enhancing security and cracking down on non-students loitering during class hours and school-related functions will.  Creating &#8216;safe havens&rsquo; where police cannot ask for identification is not going to protect your voting population.  I do not live in your district, so I feel that my words are falling on deaf ears.  It is a shame that for a short time after any tragedy we feel a bond of fraternity and community; only for it to fade away back to profiling, self-segregation, and racist/sexist attacks.  We need healing, yes, but just sitting down at a meeting hall and talking will not solve this.  Building a bigger fence will not stop the persistence of the enemy at the gate.  You seem to have your work cut out for you, Ms Skinner.  I hope you have what it takes.  <br>

<p>Comments and constructive criticism are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Those poor &#8220;youths&#8221; were so frustrated about foreclosures and the dismal economic picture that they just had to go and rape someone to get all the anger out of them.  Obviously, The System is at fault. Of course.</p>

Maybe there was a reason that God put blacks and Arabs in Africa, whites in the North and Asians in the Pacific. Us white people now have to deal with the pact we made with the devil thousands of years ago. Like in France where the Arabs and North Africans are rioting in Paris, we have to face our demons and learn from the sins of our fathers. But we can put an end to this insanity by vanquishing political correctness, and enforcing the current laws. When the blacks are biting the hand that feeds them, it&rsquo;s time to take away their food and let them survive on their own. They can&rsquo;t do it here because of their hypocrisy.

		<p>Just as remarkable as it is to think a group of young men can actually act this way in public is the fact that the collective moral sense is so lacking in the black and Hispanic communities that it would allow for this to take place for hours with all the spectators doing nothing about it. This reveals the same lack of morality as when the black boy was beaten to death in Chicago and you hear the teenage black girls laughing while filming it on their cell phones instead of calling 911. Then add to the mix the no snitching policy which is virtually universal within minority communities and it should be as plain as day that the true wedge that divides the races is the vast moral divide so evident between whites and minorities and this is why multiculturalism will never fully succeed. I think there is probably as much a genetic basis for morality as there is for IQ. </p>

		<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.  Home foreclosures, job losses, and all these other economic stressors&hellip;..that&rsquo;s what caused the gang rape of this young girl.  It is a wonder we haven&rsquo;t thought of that before.  That is probably the motive behind the rape and murder of Channon Christian and Chris Newsome.  Those worthies who committed the atrocious acts that ended the lives of that young white couple were probably discussing the economic situation of the world in general when their brains became quite overloaded with the downturn of the economy when they saw Chris and Channon drive by and decided to hijack their car.  It all ads up to me.  Rich white college kids + nice car = poverty for blacks.  Yeah, that argument sways me all right.

		<p>Brothers, You are all missing what happened and is happening all over America. Desegregation has worked but not like liberal scholars thought. The middle and upper classes have not desegregated to any extent. We stay with each other, live with each other, and marry each other. Our lower classes have become a racial hodgepodge where they all merge into a new race. A race that I call Africaucasianista. They have the same moral code, get laid, get high, don`t snitch. Some of you throwbacks call whites who act like this whiggers but it goes much deeper.The highest paid rapper is a white guy.The only thing this new race respects is violence.  Modern Americans have proved King correct to an extent.Almost 25 % of all young people are race mixing, gang banging, and have adopted nihilism as a life style. Things will only get worse as middle class whites quit reproducing and this new race corrupts the blood of generations of Gaels and Anglo-Saxons.<br>

		<p>The SF Chronical reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This was almost bound to happen. All it needed was a spark - the elements were already there&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why were the elements there?  Why were these &#8216;elements&rsquo; not addressed by school personnel?</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of the &#8216;elements&rsquo; in question:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Charles Johnson, one of Richmond High&rsquo;s security specialists&hellip;.blames the attack and much of the school&rsquo;s troubles on non-student &#8216;outsiders&rsquo; - as several of the attack suspects are - who regularly trespass on campus, and they are much less respectful of authority than the students themselves&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yz79zbk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yz79zbk</a></p>
<p>Why are trespassers &#8216;regularly&rsquo; allowed on campus?  The safety of the students was of no concern to the administration?  </p>
<p>Who is in authority here?  The trespassers or the students who attend the school?</p>
<p>A lawsuit needs to be filed, as a non-White wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do, for violating and jeopardizing the safety of the students who actually attend school on the campus.</p>

  <i>&#8220;You are all missing what is happening all over America. Desegregation has worked,  but not like liberal scholars thought.

<p>That is exactly how it is in Brazil, and all Latin America. <br>
It&rsquo;s like a game of musical chairs.  Those who lose out are forced down ino the miscegenated masses, while only the upper classes remain white. You&rsquo;re either rich or you&rsquo;re forced in with the non-whites.</p>

		<p>I have little doubt that the victim&rsquo;s family is so scared of being called racist, they feel that they have to make idiotic remarks like this, because on some level they realize how the media can be turned on them in an instant. It&rsquo;s a shame.  It&rsquo;s a shame because you can bet the elites and their tools in the newsrooms chuckle over spectacles like this.</p>

		<p>Once again the youth of America is off the chain. People keep asking why would a White family send their child to a mostly &#8220;minority&#8221; school. Well maybe they could not afford to live near a better school district. Also, the news stated the girl consumed a large amount of alcohol. Teenage parenting 101, please inform your daughters the dangers of being assaulted while intoxicated!!! Yes we need to focus on drunk driving by teens but stress to our daughters that it is NEVER safe to drink in the company of young men like that. I hope these perpetrators are punished to the full extent of the law especially the one that was 20-years-old. What the hell was he doing at a high-school dance?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain. We have had enough violence already in this place. If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger into positive action,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s family wrote.</p>

What is the legal drinking age in California? Aren&rsquo;t these teenagers (and even the 20-yr.old) underage?   Was this going on in front of the guards and school authorities?  I thought California was very strict about this. At least it once was. When I was visiting California at the age of 20, I wasn&rsquo;t even allowed a glass of wine when it was served at dinner in my uncle&rsquo;s home. He was very careful about this.  Maybe things have changed since. I guess so!</p>

Well, they&rsquo;ve been given to think so.  Every time they turn on their TV, that&rsquo;s what they see.   If they&rsquo;re the kind of people for whom the TV screen has become a substitute for reality, then that&rsquo;s all they know.  <br>

		<p>The reason, British Bulldog, that the SF &#8220;reporter&#8221; refused to discus race is that it&rsquo;s his job to conceal vital information, not to report it.  </p>
