<h1>Shocking Report Reveals That 92% of Gang Rapists in London Are Non-white</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP Blog, November 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A shocking report, ordered by the Metropolitan Police Authority, has revealed that 92 percent of all gang rapists in London are non-white. Fifty percent of all the victims are white.</p>
<p>The report, drawn up by a senior detective from the Yard&rsquo;s Operation Sapphire team, which investigates sex crimes, revealed that eight percent of all gang rape suspects in 2008/09 were white, 32 percent were black, and 24 percent contained members of different ethnicities. The make-up for the rest was unknown.</p>
<p>The proportion of white victims fell from 69 percent in 1998/99 to 50 percent last year, while the number of black victims doubled from 17 percent to 34 percent, the report continued.</p>
<p>In total, there were 93 gang rapes last year compared with 36 in 2003/04.</p>
<p>Police define the offence as being a sex attack by three or more people, although research by the Met shows an increase in the number of assaults involving four or more attackers.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s other statistics show that in 1998/99, a total of 48 percent of victims were 19 or younger. Last year that total had reached 64 percent. Thirty-six percent of victims were 15 or younger.</p>
<p>The ages of the perpetrators has also dropped. According to the Met, 42 percent were 19 and under last year, compared with 38 percent In 2003/04.</p>
<p>The number of suspects in their twenties fell slightly over that period, from 32 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p>The report, by Detective Chief Inspector Mark Yexley, says the Met &#8220;recognises multiple-perpetrator sex offending linked to youth violence as one of the most serious crime types.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that gang rape is less likely to be reported than other offences because there are often social links between victims and suspects.</p>
<p>Boroughs with the highest rates of gang rapes include Lambeth, Croydon, Newham, Southwark, Westminster and Hackney.</p>
<p>The Met also said it had asked for research into the issues of female gang membership and gang violence.</p>
<p>The report says: &#8220;Offences are complex .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from allegations of consensual sex between victims and a known party followed by non-consensual assaults committed by associates, to stranger attacks involving large groups.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Now, now, let&rsquo;s not be using words with racist overtones, like &#8220;gang rape&#8221; here.  The correct term as quoted above is &#8220;multiple-perpetrator sex&#8221; or &#8220;multiple-perpetrator penetration&#8221; even better. Say it ten times and all your crime problems will disappear.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The proportion of white victims fell from 69 percent in 1998/99 to 50 percent last year&#8221;  At least the victims are becoming more diverse.  Diversity is the single most important goal for any western society.  Now if they can only recruit more white mulit-perpetrator semi-consensual male sexual partners we will have true success in the diversity arena.</p>

		<p>The same people who brought us communism are now bringing us multiculturalism.  </p>
<p>How did communism turn out?  In virtually every country where communism was established, standard of living and opportunity plummeted, and misery and death resulted.  In just 75 years, communism, world-wide, produced ~ 100 million deaths, including ~ 20 to 30 million in the USSR, 40-60 million in China, &amp; 1 million in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism will produce the same results.</p>

		<p>Not only is this not shocking to any aware, thinking person, it is also rather surprising that anyone had the fortitude to make up this study/report, since in the PC climate over there, it can be considered overtly racist to paint any ethnic group (except Whites, of course), as being more prone to any type of criminal activity, even it borne out by that facts.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m shocked the number of gang rapists in London isn&rsquo;t 99%. Then again, maybe the govt. is fudging it in favor of the non-whites and they still can&rsquo;t get it below 90%.</p>

		<p>The day after this, Scotland Yard banned the use of the term &#8220;gang rape.&#8221;  Problem solved, in the best way a lib can.</p>

		<p>Knowing how our authorities like to count non-Euros as White when it comes to crime, I wonder how White this eight percent is.  </p>

		<p>The race of the remaining 8% may be worth closer examination.</p>
<p>I live in London and don&rsquo;t recall any instances of white gang rape being reported. I can&rsquo;t believe that the BBC would have missed such an opportunity.</p>

		<p>In Uganda it&rsquo;s still called &#8216;gang rape&rsquo;. Police are hunting for three suspected thugs who attacked and gang-raped a widow and her two granddaughters in Luweero District. The thugs armed with machetes stormed the victims&rsquo; house on September 27, and asked for proceeds the widow had got from a pig she sold. Central region Police publicist Lameck Kigozi, yesterday said the suspected thugs will be charged with rape, defilement and theft. &#8220;The thugs tied the suspects with a rope, raped the 22-year old girl first then defiled the second one aged 15,&#8221; Mr Kigozi said. They also raped the widow and forced the granddaughters to witness the act, Police said.</p>
