			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Sherwell, London Telegraph, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Col Terry Lee, a retired officer who worked with him at the military base in Texas, alleged Maj Hasan had angry confrontations with other officers over his views.</p>
<p>Maj Hasan was reportedly fighting orders to be deployed to Iraq at the end of the month, claiming that he was the victim of harassment and insults because of his Arab background and his faith.</p>
<p>The major is a psychiatrist who had been treating soldiers returning from Iraq for post-traumatic stress and alcohol and drug abuse problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was making outlandish comments condemning our foreign policy and claimed Muslims had the right to rise up and attack Americans,&#8221; Col Lee told Fox News.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said Muslims should stand up and fight the aggressor and that we should not be in the war in the first place.&#8221; He said that Maj Hasan said he was &#8220;happy&#8221; when a US soldier was killed in an attack on a military recruitment centre in Arkansas in June. An American convert to Islam was accused of the shootings.</p>
<p>Col Lee alleged that other officers had told him that Maj Hasan had said &#8220;maybe people should strap bombs on themselves and go to Time Square&#8221; in New York.</p>
<p>He claimed he was aware that the major had been subject to &#8220;name calling&#8221; during heated arguments with other officers.</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement officials have said Maj Hasan had come to their attention at least six months ago because of internet postings that discussed suicide bombings and other threats.</p>
<p>The officials said the postings appeared to have been made by Maj Hasan but they were still trying to confirm that he was the author.</p>
<p>Maj Hasan&rsquo;s cousin Nader Husan said he was happy working for the military but did dread deployment to Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Hasan said his cousin was a US-born Muslim who had joined the military after high school. He had served as a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington DC, which treats many badly wounded troops.</p>

		<p>I think this type of behavior with the suicide bombings and so forth has more to do with the inherent nature of Arabs than with the muslim religion. If the Arabs were all of Christian faith I think they would be blowing themselves up in the name of Christ. I bet the flavor of dogma they embrace has little to do with their fanatical behavior.</p>

<p>Translation:  he was happy that the military provided him with free training and a job.  And I&rsquo;ll bet he was even happier to use his training and position to sabotage the U.S. military.</p>

		<p>If the 1965 immigration reform act had not benn passed, the probability of the Fort Hood shooting occurring would have been 0&hellip;not only that, the probability of 9/11 ocurring would have been 0. Nothing could be more obvious.</p>

		<p>This is an example of political correctness trumping common sense.  This guy should have been discharged long ago.  He was clearly a threat to those around him and a threat to those serving our country.  But nobody wanted to deal with him until it was too late.</p>
<p>FWIW I too am against this war.  I think we should not be sacrificing so much for those who don&rsquo;t want us there or are indifferent at best.  But you can be against the war and against our foreign policy without being against America or against our servicemen.</p>

		<p>Where there is multiculturalism, there is danger and chaos, but, most of all, national security can never be achieved.  There&rsquo;s just too many dissidents who put their ethnicity, race and religion above all else.</p>
<p>For example, does anybody believe the Mexicans would not sell out the US if it came to a war between the US and Mexico?</p>
<p>War with Mexico would mean an instantaneous insurrection here in this country.</p>
<p>Some are so naive as to believe migrating across a border automatically switches allegiance from one country to the other.</p>
<p>Nonsense.  </p>

		<p>This is what Barrack Hussein Obama says about America.  This Jihadist is just repeating the President;s sentiments.  He was just following orders so he will not be able to be tried.   Senator Kerry called American troops Nazis and rapist.  Most of Congress calls American troops murderers.  This is why Obama was not concerned about the Ft. Hood Massecure because he thinks it was the right thing to do.</p>

		<p>When I heard about this on the tube last night, the news people quoted some fool saying, &#8220;I wish his name had been Smith&#8221;.  The only sense I can make of the statement is that this person was having trouble fitting yet another attack on Americans by a Moslem &#8220;American&#8221; into their multi-cultural mindset.  Much easier if it had been a White killer and we could blame it all on the National Rifle Association or racism or pre-traumatic stress.  <br>

		<p>The media has hit a new low with this story. This morning one of the nitwits on the news kept repeating that Hasan had been picked on and called a &#8216;camel jockey&rsquo;, as if this justifies opening fire on his comrades. The talking heads also &#8216;determined&rsquo; that this attack was not terrorism because the shooter allegedly acted alone. Clearly his motivation was Islam and his determination not to be deployed to Iraq. His primary loyalty was to his alien belief system. </p>

<p>Corollary to what you say, if the typical adherent to the religion of Islam were Swedish, (i.e. the real Swedes), then moderate/docile interpretations of the Koran would be the order of the day.  It&rsquo;s not so much *Islam* that breeds radical interpretations of the Koran, it&rsquo;s the racial makeup and racial jealousy of the typical Muslim that drives the hate and terrorism.  And like you say, if they call converted to Christianity tomorrow, they would lean on extremist and violent interpretations of the Bible to justify their violence. </p>

		<p>A couple of important questions here:<br>
*The major was a psychiatrist who was counseling soldiers returning from theaters of war. What was he saying to them? How was he helping them? I think perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t and our soldiers do not deserve this.<br>
*Since the military obviously knew he was loony (his poor performance ratings and all), why was he allowed to even deal with returning soldiers?<br>
Everyone knows that Muslims, whether in the military or out of it, hate the American people and its armed forces. (And if we didn&rsquo;t know, the major gave his comrades every evidence of his nasty beliefs). We should therefore castigate the U.S. military for its failure to act on such obvious evidence.</p>

<p>I have to wonder what kind of logic thinks it&rsquo;s appropriate to have a Middle Easterner counseling Americans returning from war with Middle Easterners in the first place.  The fact he went jihad on a base and caused so much misery is proof that if we don&rsquo;t profile and properly vet people we are ignoring the obvious.  <br>

		<p>First off, never accept the statements of Muslims. They maintain the right to mislead infidels. Second, President Barack Hussein Obama has told not to presume on the cause of this attack (hint to the MSM). So it is up to us on the net to tell the glaringly apparent truth about this ethno-religious assault, and to tell it early and often.</p>

		<p>One of the first things that crossed my mind after the identity of the suspect became public is that a President with three Arab names wouldn&rsquo;t much denounce terrorism on the part of an Army Major with three Arab names.  Thus far, I seem to be right.</p>
<p>14 Anonymous:  An AR poster a few months ago, in response to a Muslim troll who described Muslims as a &#8220;morality&#8221; and an &#8220;excellence,&#8221; and asked us not to &#8220;holocaust&#8221; Muslims, noted that Islam has a concept called &#8220;taqqiya.&#8221;  What it means is that Muslims are allowed to lie as long as it&rsquo;s designed to advance Islam.  From that point on, my worldview vis-a-vis Muslims and the way they act was changed.</p>
<p>I used to halfway believe that AQ and OBL would leave us alone if we got out of the Muslim world, because of my isolationist/neutralitarian sensibilities.  However, I no longer believe that, because I assume that AQ/OBL is using taqqiya and therefore lying.  The reason they say this is because they think there will be enough white American infidels that will believe it and act upon it.  Obviously, AQ/OBL terrorism would continue in the U.S. even if Ron Paul is Secretary of State.</p>

When I turned on the radio today this story was being 
reported. In the story the shooter was identified only
as an officer and psychiatrist. No name name, ethnic, 
or religious identifiers were mentioned. That&rsquo;s right, 
they didn&rsquo;t even say his name! Guess, this comes as 
no surprise to anyone on this site.

		<p>The multiracial,cultural suicide of America. Nothing but misery, chaos and bloodshed is the only outcome of a multiracial/cultural/religious America. How is die-versity working out for us?  I remember the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s and the comparison of then and now is like night and day. I feel like I am on another planet. This can&rsquo;t be the America I grew up in.

<p>There are Arab Christians in the Near East - quite a few, in fact. Bear in mind that, before the rise of Islam, the peoples of the region were overwhelmingly Christian. Some remain to this day, and are members of those ancient Christian churches. These Arab Christians do not engage in suicide bombings since, to a Christian, suicide is a sin.<br>
The source of the problem is Islam itself. Even a white European, converted to Islam, would accept suicide bombings.   </p>

		<p>There should be no muslims in the USA, UK, or Europe.  Why are they there?  Because we invited them.  Why are they angry at us?  Two reasons.  One, we are in their countries either blowing them up or supporting oppressive and corrupt regimes. They don&rsquo;t want us in their countries. Two, Muslims aren&rsquo;t stupid enough to think they are British or French or Austrians.  Not only do they not think they are White, they don&rsquo;t want to be and know that they cannot be.  Only the marxist white thinks they&rsquo;ll assimilate into marxist peasants.  Maybe Whites could learn something from the muslim.  Or the Japanese.  Or the Chinese. Or even La Raza.  My God, how did we degenerate this far?</p>
<p>Robert and &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;:  Much of Islam is, in fact, Arabism.  The violence, infighting, revanchism has been a part of Arab culture for thousands of years.  I am not so sure of the genetic factors, however, and I have never heard of a violent Christian Arab.</p>
<p>The real enemy of the White race and western civilization is marxism.  Islam is only taking advantage of our marxist induced weakness.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that the officers involved in enabling and promoting Major Nidal Malik Hasan knew full well of his extremely prejudice and biased nature. Furthermore I am convinced that his hatred of western ideals and culture was clearly evident. If the US Armed Forces has a strict policy against letting members or sympathizers of &ldquo;extremist originations&rdquo; (such as any white racialists group) and for perceived reasons that they would pose a threat and a danger to the US Armed Forces and thus to America - to join or stay in the service then they are surely guilty of reckless endangerment (or worse) of the innocent victims by letting a known fanatical Muslim like Hasan to stay in the US Army. Either the Army or the civil courts should bring them to trial on behalf of the surviving victims and the relatives of the deceased. Anything less would be a travesty of justice.   <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently read in several different places that the Army is so hard up for field-grade officers these days that anyone with a pulse and no court-martial on his record can make major. It&rsquo;s no longer a cutoff point where only the best and most ambitious officers get the oak leaf.</p>

		<p>This incident confirms one thing in my mind.  And I say this as a retired military officer:</p>
<p>All you patriots out there who think we are still living in the days of John Wayne, take heed.  The military will do NOTHING as an institution to stop the overthrow of the Constitution of the United States.  When the time comes to shoot civilians and imprison them on the orders of the Marxist tyrants, they will do it and say nothing.</p>
<p>Gosh, I hope I am wrong.  But I have no confidence or faith in Americans to stand up any more.  I&rsquo;ve just seen too many failures.</p>

		<p>The big difference between the Koran and the Bible is the style of the prose, the Koran does not lend itself to interpretation nearly as much as the Bible does. There is a lot less metaphor and symbolism in general. The Koran has a very blunt and direct way of addressing issues and giving edicts.  Islam is all about Piece, getting a piece of you if youre not Muslim.</p>

		<p>As a hypothetical, suppose instead of a U.S. hating Muslim, the terrorist had been a White Nationalist male with the same antipathies except his motivation was the treatment that White men were getting. Imagine the reaction of the politicians, particularly B.O., and the News. There would be called for even more intense screening to prevent such men from being in the  military service. The psychiatric community would offer contrite apologies because such a monster had somehow become a psychiatrist. The woman who shot him would become a bigger Feminist hero than Lorena Bobbitt. <br>

		<p>As soon as I saw the first reports on the Internet of the Ft. Hood shootings, I just knew the killer was Muslim. What kinda surprised me is that it wasn&rsquo;t a black Muslim - like the guy who chimped out a couple of years ago in Iraq, by throwing a grenade at a tent with GI&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>This guy was a psychiatrist? I thought that was unheard of, in the Muslim world, because EVERYTHING in their lives is dictated by the Koran.</p>
<p>Army justice is swifter and harsher than civilian justice. At the very least, this guy will get life imprisonment with no parole. He could also get the death penalty  for first degree murder, and treason.</p>
<p>Note also, fellow Amrenners, that the shootings took place in a &#8220;gun-free zone&rsquo;  - even though this was a military base.</p>
<p>Of course, Obama tells the rest of us not to &#8220;rush to judgment&#8221; against an Islamic  brother of his. What else would you expect from a man who bowed down to the king of Saudi Arabia?</p>

		<p>President Obama is not totally innocent as to this shooting incidence.  Obama has, trhough his Cairo speach, soften up the American stand toward Islam (the religion of piece [sic]). It is now clear for any state employee including those in the armed forces, that the Allah-fearing moslems are becoming more untouchable by the day. Under President Bush, someone would have been alarmed by the increased radicalisation of this colleague doctor of mine, and taken action.  But not today.  Imagine if he was innocent. Imagine what Obama would say today, if you report an innocent man to the military police, just because he&rsquo;s starting to wear islamic clothing and spending more time in the mosques. Your carreer would probably be on stake. You would of course be both a racist and an islamophobe. It is partly because of fear of Obama and the Obamamania, that moslems are becoming untouchable in the US, like they already are in Europe. Fact is, if you do not embrace &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, you do not have a future in any public run organisation in the west. So you do think for your self that this moslem might turn into a jihadist, but now way, can you speak it out loud. Obama and his diciples will be coming for you. </p>

		<p>The spin started immediately after this nut opened fire.  That is wasn&rsquo;t about religion - the Islamic religion to be precise.  No, of course not.  Except that it was immediately apparent to me and I am sure many many others, that Muslims, along with ALL other minorities in this country - are also a protected class.</p>
<p>I knew too that the news media and others would frantically search for a &#8220;motive.&#8221;  Of course, the motive was staring them right in the face but again, that can&rsquo;t be reported.  We are no longer fighting a &#8220;War on Terror.&#8221;  Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s the politically correct words now &#8220;Overseas contingency operations.&#8221;   And it didn&rsquo;t take 24 hours (Geraldo Rivera on the Factor last night) for news celebrities to make sure that we all understand that not all muslims are bad people.</p>
<p>There can only be two reasons this guy went on his rampage.  </p>
<p>1.  He is a nut job pure and simple.</p>
<p>2.  He is an Islamic terrorist who is no different than other muslims who strap explosives around their waists, walk onto a bus or into a building and blow themselves up, killing as many of they possibly can.</p>
<p>What is the difference between Hasan who used guns to take out the supposed enemies if Iskan or the terrorist who pilots a jet into a building.</p>
<p>There is no difference as far as I am concerned.  </p>
<p>Not only does my heart break for the families of the 12 he killed in Texas, along with the 30 he wounded, my heart breaks for the hundreds of soliders he supposedly counseled during his tenure at Walter Reed Hospital.</p>
<p>In the name of political correctness, these rampages will continue.  </p>
<p>It was interesting that we now all know who this guy is but I can&rsquo;t recall in the last 2 days hearing the name of even one of the victims.</p>

<p>Respectfully, I believe the difference between the Hebrew bible (the Christian is largely pacifist) and the Koran is simply the intellectual level of its readers.  The average Jew&rsquo;s IQ is 110, while the average worldwide Muslim&rsquo;s is probably 85:<br>
http://vdare.com/misc/rushton_african_iq_map.htm</p>
<p>Muslim countries are analogous to middle schools, in which the bad kids attack the good ones.  Except they have a Koran telling them that they&rsquo;re actually the superior ones.  And they lack the intellectual ability of Jews to filter fact from fable.  Let me point out that I&rsquo;m talking worldwide here.  The Muslims, like Indians, who are in America are mostly legal and have been selected by Immigration for intellectual ability.</p>

		<p>Just some thoughts here:<br>
The military has been adequately transformed to the same degree as society at large of embracing multiculturalism.  Clearly it is recognized by some in the military that this disease exists, and the military leaders employ the same insipid excuses as we see our manipulating ruling elite use outside the military.  Above all, preservation of multiculturalism and multiracialism is the highest and most important objective, even if it kills us.  What a perverted use of our intellect and judgment.<br>
Hopefully we&rsquo;ll have a collective awakening (I think it is starting) and put a stop to this insanity.<br>
How many more White Americans are we going to kill in the name of diversity ?<br>
What is amusing, if anything can be at this point, is how all these talking heads are twisting themselves into a pretzel making insipid excuses for this jihadist.  Remind me to invite the guy that just beat and robbed my family in my home to come over for a friendly game of cards and a beverage.<br>
You know, if I was a military officer right now, I&rsquo;d be downright embarrassed that this sort of thing happened.  Just imagine the obvious emasculation of the military ego in light of this event and being not only duped by this fraud, but by your own, and then pretending something else entirely has occurred – kind of makes you look stupid as well.  You even have one of these enriching diversity types as your supreme commander.  Utterly breathtaking.<br>

		<p>This incident shows how politically corrected the US Military has become. According to the talking news heads, peers and superior officers in this guy&rsquo;s unit knew he was a problem and a radical, yet they did nothing.  Why?  Simple, to rat this individual out would be heresy against the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;, a crime against PC.</p>
<p>The US military is often held up to be a meritocracy, and in many elite units it is.  But too often PC trumps everything especially in promotions and fat assignments.  </p>
<p>To survive and continue their large budgets, the military must bend to the wishes of an increased politically corrected culture. Hence the Navy, which hasn&rsquo;t fought a serious sea battle since 1945, is in the business of running ship board brothels.  The ground forces have seen its combat reserve capacity dwindle because of so many females in support units. These support units have traditionally been relied upon as backup infantry, ask any &#8220;frozen chosen&#8221; or &#8220;tet offensive&#8221; vet.  </p>
<p>Physical fitness standards have been compromised to allow females in certain jobs.  The officer corps has been riddled with officers &#8220;affirmative actioned&#8221; into officer ranks, such as this Maj who did the shooting.  All to appease the gods of PC adn diversity. </p>
<p>You need to look no further than the jackass now in charge of the Naval Academy.  Adm. Roughead, according to the Washington Post, has declared that &ldquo;Diversity is the number one priority&rdquo;. Not, of course, &#8220;killing and/or maiming&#8221;  the enemy. </p>
<p>Anyway, the real threat is the white nineteen year old boy from Georgia with a confederate flag tattoo on his arm.   In order to join, this young white kid will have to reject his culture and its symbols. The tattoo with have to come off first. Not so with the religion of peace individuals who demand their heritage and religious symbols be accepted and respected. Military rules and regs are bent to accommodate them. </p>

		<p>It  is no more complicated than this:Hasan and his family are muslims&hellip;THE DO NOT BELONG IN OUR AMERICA!!!!</p>
<p>But they are here because of the passage of the passage of the treasonous 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>
<p>Why is Islam being allowed to expand in majority White Christian nation?</p>
<p>There is no justification for allowing Islam to expand in America. There is no economic,cultural,reilgious and ecological reason for allowing Islam to expand in OUR AMERICA!!!</p>
<p>The intent of post-1965 immigration policy is to race-replace the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICA population and provide the greedy-cheating class with a massive labor subsidy.</p>
<p><br>
Driving through the Shennandoah Valley last Christmas just past a very famous Civil War battle site-The VMI cadets won this battle-  right before a Denny&rsquo;s, I could see what looked a large number of Pakistani kids off the boat running back and forth between back yards. It was mentioned in the mainstream media that Dr. Hassain had &#8220;deep&#8221; roots in the America South. Islam is expanding in the heartland of America Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
<p>A vote for Mitt Romney,Mike Huckabee,Sarah Palin or the hindu Bobby Jindal is a vote for the massive race-replacement of millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN.</p>

<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any benefit for the West from fighting Iraqis and Afghanis in their own lands. It wasn&rsquo;t them, who planned and performed terrorist acts in the West. No - the ones blowing things (and people) up were mostly Muslims born and/or educated in the West. <br>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t shock me. Political correctness is at fault for this, plain and simple, just like it was at fault for 911. This man should have been out of the military years ago just like the 911 terrorists should never have been allowed into the USA but thanks to PC, they were. He was openly espousing treason and terrorism and he not only kept his job but was promoted simply because he was a non-White and muslim. He made a huge salary. America didn&rsquo;t learn after 911 and I don&rsquo;t think it will learn from this either. Of course as someone pointed out, had he been a White nationalist, he would have been out years ago. I am  against this war because I&rsquo;m an isolationist and for the reason that going to war for any reason other than the defense of America is very harmful to America(billions of dollars spent and lives lost}. Having said that, being against something in no way justifies violence or being against the troops and military.</p>

		<p>I do notice a few trends. I find that when there is a mass shooting, it&rsquo;s usually in a place that bars the carrying of firearms.  The anti-gun ownership people say making guns illegal will stop any gun violence yet where the shootings are, guns are usually prohibited. Also, many people who do mass shootings get their guns illegally, so how will making them illegal for law abiding citizens change anything. Another thing I notice that in the South, which has a higher level of gun ownership, there is the least amount of shootings. Just an observation. </p>

I heard the MSM trying to &#8220;explain the motive,&#8221; and as we all know it is clear, for one, Muslims and Arabs kill in the name of Allah and believe that infidels shall be killed and lied to as a motive at any time, so it will remain, as always a crime of the military because they were killing &#8220;Arabs and that is politically unacceptable.&#8221;  I thought this would wake up  people to the reality that we need to put in restrictions to legal and illegal immigration, but my hopes have been stalled I believe.</p>

<p>I worked very hard to recall California Governor Gray Davis over the issue of his support for granting CA drivers licenses to illegal aliens. Our successful recall campaign featured the ugly, racially alien picture of Osama Bin Ladin on a California drivers license. That was great propaganda, it worked.</p>
<p>All of our successful WN, populist, nationalist parties in Europe make Muslim extremist immigration as the main propaganda enemy. It works.</p>
<p>OK, so let&rsquo;s get to work and hammer home the simple, easy to understand propaganda theme that America must control immigration to keep out, expel dangerous NW - the worst being Muslim extremist Jihadists.</p>
<p>Those American &#8220;patriots&#8221; trying to &#8220;save America&#8221; by talking endlessly about THE CONSTITUTION, economic conservatism, conspiracy theories and ignoring Muslim murderers of our people in our country - these folks will never win anything more than 1%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy folks, - a free throw. Virtually all Whites in America, in the world, fear, hate NW Muslims - let&rsquo;s use this, go with it, make it our winning propaganda theme.</p>

		<p>Just what about the religion of Islam coincides with the U.S. military and its purpose? The core beliefs of the two are totally incompatible; on opposite poles. So what would make a Muslim want to join an organization in a country whose culture he despises, and whose purpose was to protect and defend the United States and its beliefs? The answer is mighty suspicious to me. Even worse, why would the U.S. military even be accepting such people who hold polar opposite views to our own?</p>

<p>There was strong White working class opposition to Black crime, Black integration in the 60s, early 70s.  There are many reasons a White George Wallace, Frank Rizo or a White political party didn&rsquo;t come out of it.</p>
<p>The Chicago Dems do an excellent job of cutting deals for most everyone who will pay to play - so White ethnics, White working class still come out, get connected, get union jobs through the Chicago Dems. The Chicago Dems are more like an organized crime outfit than the standard LIb/Min anti White Democrat national party.</p>
<p>The Chicago Dems are more concerned about some war committeemen post than OBama getting elected President.</p>
<p>Also, the Chicago Blacks are not constantly threatening to riot and cause trouble like  Blacks in other places - the city is huge and very segregated, the underclass Blacks being on the bottom - everyone knows this - so middle class, upper class Blacks, everyone including Whites, Middle Eastern cab drivers is aware that virtually all the crime and problems come from the low life, underclass criminal Blacks, so everyone is on guard 24/7. And when you are on guard, it is usually only those people that do something foolish that get hurt, killed by criminal Blacks and there are lots of decent Blacks here.<br>

<p>I think the simplest explanation to your question is that the whites of Chicago are typical urban liberals, white cultural Marxists.  And, being that, they sympathize with the plight of the oppressed and grant them their right to be angry victims.  Otherwise, they seek to appease them by being passive and by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist, or that it is something else.  That behaviour is typical of leftists.</p>

		<p>This country is a cauldron of hatred fueled by the globalist warped concept of the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of the melting pot. They falsely expound the &#8220;benefits&rsquo; of (social) diversity through the media, which they own or control. In effect, many of those &#8220;diverse&#8221; immigrants, or their offspring, serve in our military only for economic benefits  &mdash;  which means they are nothing more than mercenaries without any feelings of patriotism. Many hate Americans and our way of life.</p>
<p>Globalism is synonymous with the international corporate structure.  Globalists, with their enormous resources, dictate the direction of our immigration and asylum laws and policies. The globalists accord with their outsourced factories&rsquo; hosts to compel our Government to take as many economic refugees as they want to dump on us. In exchange, corporations get to exploit their hosts&rsquo; cheap labor and gain freedom from environmental protection laws and freedom from paying any significant workmens&rsquo; benefits.</p>
<p>Our middle class is not only apathetic to what the globalists are doing, they know that their futures are entwined in the international corporations though stocks. They know that their retirement is tied to the success of the of the corporations, regardless of the requirement that we take their host countries&rsquo; economic refugees.  </p>
<p>Someday, when their business are taken over by their hosts (nationalized, as were the once American-owned railroads and oil industry in Mexico), or the teeming masses rise up and show their smoldering hatred by assaulting and killing Americans (as they did at the beginning of the Mexican Revolution in 1911),  <br>
the Americans will try to flee &#8220;home.&#8221; But they will find &#8220;home&#8221; taken over by the riff raff that they aided and abetted in coming here.  </p>

		<p>If this whole thing wasn&rsquo;t so serious, it would laughable in that some nitwit in the military assigned this guy to counsel returning and wounded soldiers who had just fought against Muslims.  Seems to me that the person who assigned this whack job, also needs counseling himself.</p>
<p>It is also disturbing yet not surprising that fellow classmates repeatedly reported Hasan&rsquo;s anti-American rants but the ranking officials didn&rsquo;t want to report it for fear of discrimminating against a Muslim soldier. </p>
<p>While this guy is no different that Mohammed Atta and his 18 fellow terrorists who murdered 3,000 people on 9/11, his approach works better.  Destroy from within.  </p>
<p>This terrible tradegy at Fort Hood, unfortunately will not be the last.  And I am already sick of hearing how there are so many good Muslim Americans.</p>

		<p>Reply to Jonathan above:</p>
<p>I have nothing but respect for the U.S. Military although that respect is slowly dwindling away.  Both of my grandfathers served in WWII, one in Germany and the other in the Phillipines.  Of course, I understand that today&rsquo;s military is nothing like the military of WWII and I&rsquo;m not referring to weapons, I am referring to the people that they have allowed to infiltrate our military.</p>
<p>20 years ago, I would never have believed that our military would fire on it&rsquo;s own civilians but after Ruby Ridge and Waco, my belief has changed. Several months ago, it was revealed that 20 years ago, only 10% of the U.S. Military would follow orders to shoot American citizens, that number has risen to 30%.  </p>
<p>No outside forces could destroy our military. When  you want to destroy something - you do it from within.  Major Hasan is a prime example and the really scary part is how many more Hasan&rsquo;s are there just waiting their turn.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another thing I notice that in the South, which has a higher level of gun ownership, there is the least amount of shootings. Just an observation.&#8221; </p>
<p>Anonymous #39</p>
<p>I am a staunch 2nd Ammendment supporter. I disagree with you on the geographics. The massacre in Looby&rsquo;s cafeteria occured in Looby&rsquo;s cafeteria in Kileen Tx which is the town to which Ft. Hood is nearest. ALso there were shootings in Louisiana, Florida and Arkansas. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.<br>
That being, said this murder was motivated by Islam. This is a &#8220;religion&#8221; for whom propagation of the faith by any means necessary is practically its mission statement. They will never coexist in a democratic republic where there is separation of church and state. They will eliminate all the other religious groups including its adherents. We&rsquo;ve been completely paralyzed by political correctness and fear of being called bigots. The progressives have been very successful in controlling our behavior and even our thoughts.<br>
Remember the statue of Jesus submerged in a jar of urine at an &#8220;art&#8221; exhibition in NYC several years ago or the statue of the Virgin Mary surrounded by elephant dung in another &#8220;art&#8221; exhibition?<br>
Except for a strong protest from the head of the Catholic League, I believe his name is Donahue, there was hardly a whisper. <br>
The cartoons of Muhammed sparked rioting, burnings and death threats from Muslims. This is the religion that motivated a man in Turkey to douse his 18 year old daughter with gasoline and immolate her because she came out of her house wearing shorts on a hot summer day. Or the guy here in the states who took his two teenage daughters out in his car and shot them to death because they didn&rsquo;t want to dress in the Hijab and were wearing makeup because they wanted to be American teens. The same religion that motivated the Iraqi immigrant to run over his own young daughter two weeks ago because she wanted to be like an American.<br>
We have to ask ourselves if living with these people is worth the possible annihilation of us all. Do we have the time to sort them out? How much more evidence do we need before we act?<br>
Remember Benyamin Netanyahu warned us that when someone constantly tells you he&rsquo;s going to kill you, you better believe him!<br>
Expecting these people to assimilate and coexist peacefully with us, the infidels, is as fanciful as trying to herd cats.,</p>

		<p>Some may be offended by this post, however, offense is not my intent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve served in Iraq. I&rsquo;ve seen them, up close and firsthand, in their true form. Trust me, Muslims are far from the God-fearing, peace-loving people their apologists here in the States claim them to be. </p>
<p>Perhaps the brand of Islam practiced mainstream here in the States is peaceful, but true Islam, the nonsense they adhere blindly to in the Middle East, is nothing but brutal hegemony cloaked in a fake theology.</p>
<p>The moral highroad will get us nowhere with these homicidal lunatics. In all interactions they desire one of two things: conversion, or murder. Period. In the end, they understand nothing but violence. </p>
<p>No amount of weak-kneed, spineless handwringing by multicultural zealots will make the threat posed by Islam go away. Turning the other cheek only offers them a new and easier target. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the scraggly beards, long robes, and silly &#8220;scriptural&#8221; quotes from the Qu&rsquo;ran fool you. They stone their women, brainwash their children, and play on the weakness that widespread illiteracy creates. </p>
<p>I hold myself to objectivity - and humility - in my dealings with others, but in this one vein there can be neither. There&rsquo;s is a culture, supported by the &#8220;will of Allah,&#8221; that preaches and inculcates violence. They will respond only to the business end of a rifle. </p>
<p>Hasan should be pilloried, his family scorned, his pre-shooting rants and ravings publicized, clips of him dressed in robes and skull cap flashed everywhere.</p>
<p>Make every effort to highlight his bowing down five times a day&hellip;to the &#8220;god&#8221; that holds blessings for those that commit these atrocities. </p>

<p>And it makes me wonder if they didn&rsquo;t intentionally keep him around, waiting for him to explode, knowing full well that the presence of people like him (high-ranking, unstable, affirmative-action minority officers) would scare young whites away from potential military service.  Thus creating a perfect opportunity to fill the void with rabid, illegal, non-whites, completely loyal to Obama.  And they wonder why Americans have bought up every last gun and bullet in record time.</p>

<p>Sure.  They&rsquo;ve had no difficulty at all.  They&rsquo;ve assimilated perfectly to the cultural Marxist paradigm presented to them by the rich leftist elite whites who are subverting the country.  They&rsquo;ve learned all the counter culture lessons of victimology, rage, anger and displaced self-delusion.  They are unpatriotic, anti-American and whiney cry babies.  Just like any other leftist in America.  They&rsquo;re convinced that they&rsquo;re living in the worst place on Earth.  They hear it daily in the white owned media, from the white elite Democrats, and learn it daily in the white leftist controlled education system.  So, they&rsquo;ve acculturated perfectly to the society we live in.  Otherwise, can you please tell me what &#8220;white culture&#8221; you have in mind?  Something from the 1940s perhaps?</p>

&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know about nowadays but back in the sixties Chicagoans were pretty militant . They openly opposed MLK&rsquo;s march there . That is where MLK said, &rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been in Alabama, I&rsquo;ve been in Mississippi but I have never seen hate like this before .&rdquo; I have a nephew who went to a teach school near there and he said, &rdquo; you see a lot more turbans in Chicago than you do baseball caps or fedoras&rsquo;.&rdquo; Maybe that is what has changed them .&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the Midwest orginally, but have lived in Chicago, other parts of Illinois, Ohio Michigan, and Indiana. I now live in the Southeast, and I can say unequivocally, that there is much greater anti-black feelings in the North than the South. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no comparison, in fact, the greatest anti-black rhetoric I&rsquo;ve ever heard came from people in the North, which is probably due to the fact the blacks outside the South are much greater loud mouthed trouble-makers.</p>
<p>If a violent anti-black backlash ever occurs, it will come from the North or the Midwest.  Absolutely no question about it, and I&rsquo;m certain the reason for it is because the whites there judge a person by his character, not by the color of his skin.  And black character is deplorable.</p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;m retired military. How do you ask people to serve with those that you can&rsquo;t trust? Major Hasan is not an isolated incident. </p>
<p>&#8220;Remember Sgt. Asan Akbar, a Muslim American soldier with the 326th Engineer Battalion? He lobbed a hand grenades and aimed his M-4 automatic rifle into three tents filled with sleeping commanding officers at the 101st Airborne Division&rsquo;s 1st Brigade operations center in Kuwait.  &#8220;There were other terrorist as well that have joined our military.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right on, Hoosier.  There are also many gangbangers in the military, besides a seditious jihadist element.  </p>
<p>Too, the military in all branches have become so politically correct it&rsquo;s not possible to cull these people out, because those who are in charge now want the military to fail and fail it will.  The seditionists are less of a threat actually than Army PC policy that promotes unqualified blacks to leadership positions when they just barely qualify as enlisted men.</p>
<p>The empire is in its last days, and,  as has always been the case with empires,  it is the military that weakens first,  right before the collapse.</p>

		<p>There is really only one problem in this country, which leads to all the other problems: multiculturalism - the mistaken belief that other cultures are just like us deep inside. They ain&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The corollary is that their belief systems are also in some sense &#8220;equal&#8221; and thus should be given equal status and recognition. Thus the obviously barbaric is made somehow more &#8220;civilized.&#8221; Floggings, mutilations, honor killings and suicide bombings ultimately become a new norm and are debated rather than abhorred for the vile barbaric acts they are. It&rsquo;s their culture, we are told.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s labeled an &#8220;exception,&#8221; such as these shootings. So how many exceptions does it take to make a trend, a movement, a militaristic and intolerant &#8220;religion&#8221; bent on world enslavement and domination? Again and again, these &#8220;exceptions&#8221; spring from inside the confines of ye old local mosque, and are now featured at the local army base, and coming soon to a venue near you&hellip;.</p>
<p>The tension between Western and Judeo/Christian values and Islam has deep historic roots. Islamic invaders have been repeatedly stopped in their efforts to conquer the west and impose their will upon us at great sacrifice. Now we invite them in. How stupid have we become?</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Islamic Extremist&#8221; is a redundant term. It makes no real sense. Islam is itself extreme in doctrine and practice and breeds the antisocial and psychopathic - extremist - behavior that so commonly arises from its so-called &#8220;teachings.&#8221; It is the &#8220;religion&#8221; of historically primitive cultures that missed out on the whole Age of Reason and Enlightenment thing that so transformed Western Culture, by promoting reason over religious doctrine and weaving individual rights into the very fabric of western society. Islam is counter to that development and seeks to undo these triumphs over despotism and restore the world to a Dark Age status. It is beyond tragic that it is these very triumphs that now prove to be the undoing of Western Culture having not only led to an illogical tolerance of the &#8220;diverse&#8221; but also by elevating individual rights to a status that is beyond all responsibility, expressed perhaps best by the line from a 60s counter-culture song that, &#8220;I&rsquo;d rather have my country die for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as we continue to make &#8220;tolerance&#8221; the keystone of modern society, we will soon find ourselves tolerating anything. There are clearly things we should not tolerate. Yet, in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; we do. It is suicide for the values that were won by generations of sacrifice and labor, the sacrifice of countless individuals to something greater than themselves, all those, from serf to philosopher, soldier to statesman, who brought us to a world where there is at least some justice and some way to redress grievances against the oppressor.</p>
<p>Imperfect as it still is, we have come a long way from the days of the Dark Ages. But we now stand on a precipice and can easily plunge back into the darkness from which we may never again escape.</p>

<p>Look what the homeland security secratary is worried about.  She should be fired.  We are supposed to be on alert for a backlash against muslims.  Homeland security warns us to be on the look out for anything suspicious, but this guy was making statements right under their noses and not one thing was done about it.  She now runs around the world worring about a backlash against muslims.  Hell, she should be concerned about the backlash against America and whites after all the demonization the left is espousing.</p>

The idea that this Muslim could actually be advising White American soldiers is incredible.  The idea that he could even join the army is incredible.

		<p>To back in Chicago (post # 49):</p>
<p>Chicago Bantus do threaten to riot, from time to time ESPECIALLY if Jessie Jackson is ready to egg them on. Also, don&rsquo;t forget ex-Black Panther Bobby Rush now sits in Congress and wants to strip all Americans of their Second Amendment rights. So they are tossed bones from time to time to keep quiet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spot on about white Chicagoans being cultural Marxiats - they who would never imagine walking alone in South Woodlawn, Garfield Park, or Roseland at midnight- are the ones cheering the loudest for the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Obama, Michael Jordan, Walter Payton (when he was alive and playing) and Sammy Sosa, and suck up to them like crazy.</p>
<p>The Chicago political organization, is indeed like a Cosa Nostra commission, with the City Council being a rubber stamp. Chicago&rsquo;s universities have reputations for being ultra-liberal, whether public like U. of Illinois at Chicago, or Catholic like Loyola and DePaul.</p>
<p>The Chicago political organization wants Obama in the White House, as long as it keeps him away from Daley. It knows that, if Obama loses in 2012, comes to Chicago and decides to run for mayor in 2015, it would be game over for Daley.</p>
<p>There is one bright spot in all this: As you may know, SCOTUS is going to hear the Second Amendment case, McDonald v. Chicago, this term. This case is expected to result in the incorporation of the Second Amendment against states and municipalities. That means Chicago&rsquo;s draconian gun control laws could be struck down.</p>
<p>If that happens, whites in Chicago are going to legally purchase guns like groceries. Then, there will be less fear of criminals, which in Chicago - as elsewhere- tend to be Bantus and mestizos.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.</p>

Hyperexaggertated greivance that can only be solved by collectivism.  No, it looks to me like they&rsquo;ve taken up the philosophy of the white ivory tower elitists quite readily, and they can&rsquo;t wait to be slaves again.</p>

		<p>The United States Army, if it were charged with being defeated in foreign wars against ideological opponents, would receive a medal. Korea essentially a loss, Vietnam a loss, and now Iraq/Afghanistan proving to be a loss.<br>
Tens of thousands of American lives lost; hundreds of billions of dollars wasted.<br>
Victory has eluded the American Army for a half century.<br>
Personally I think its prestige, even its stature as an institution, is crumbling. The principle connection it has with the American people,which is the nationality of the troops themselves and the concern the Army hierarchy has for their well-being and safety, is being questioned even as I write.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Muslims, like Indians, who are in America are mostly legal and have been selected by Immigration for intellectual ability&#8221;</p>
<p>  This is not true. While some immigrants are admitted for their skill, the majority are not. Most immigrants are here because they were related to someone already in the United States. This is called chain migration. Many Muslims (Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, etc.) have also been admitted as refugees. A significant number have also stayed after their student Visas expired. In addition, the H1-B program has been a corporate shill for cheap labor from South Asia.</p>

		<p>Every one seems to have forgotten about the death of nearly 200 marines who were killed in  Lebannon while sleeping in their baracks OCT 1983(this prompted Ronnie Reagan to attack the defensless island of Grenada whose goverment could have been taken down by a gang of street thugs rounded up from Rikers Island without too much trouble) The terrorist at the center of this terrorist attack was an Eygptian national who was a CIA asset in the middle east who was allowed to migrate LEGALLY to  America and obtain US citizenship. After which&hellip;he joined the 82nd Air Borne and made Captain. He was providing middle east terrorist with the intelligence &hellip;and materials to pull of the mass murder of mostly Native Born White US marines. I&rsquo;m suprised that Vadre.com hasn&rsquo;t covered this. It was a front page story in the Wall Street Journal over a decade ago.</p>
<p>Why does America need a high fertility and rapidly growing Musilm population. How do Native Born White Americans benefit from this?</p>
<p>All of these recent terrorist attacks on American soil were completely avoidable. No one should be shocked at all that they happened.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to the talking news heads, peers and superior officers in this guy&rsquo;s unit knew he was a problem and a radical, yet they did nothing. Why? Simple, to rat this individual out would be heresy against the &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo;, a crime against PC..&#8221;</p>
<p>It is worse than that.  Even the military must bow to the altar of PC correctness.</p>
<p>M. Brimelow reported this on V.Dare.com last night:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Malik Hasan&rsquo;s supervisors had previously had problems with him:</p>
<p>I sympathize with the difficulty these supervisors faced: it is very hard for a white supervisor to weed out a troublesome non-white subordinate because of the army&rsquo;s Equal Opportunity Office. The military has a fierce, well funded and staffed EEO bureaucracy. Although the office is officially racially neutral, everyone knows how the deck is stacked. Personally, I was never able to dismiss unsatisfactory non-white subordinates, and other officers of my acquaintance experienced the same problem&hellip;.it is easier to just promote the troublemaker and transfer him to a different post. This is probably what happened in the case of Major Hasan&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Two things  &mdash;  <br>
There is NO SUCH THING as a &#8220;moderate, peaceful muslim&#8221;.  The koran DOES NOT ALLOW deviation from the concept of &#8220;conquest&#8221; (jihad), total submission, intolerance towards &#8220;non-believers&#8221; or &#8220;apostates&#8221; (those who want to leave the muslim &#8220;faith&#8221; (cult).  Apostates are generally killed for renouncing islam (the religion of peace).<br>
In the United States military, chaplains and medical doctors are given &#8220;direct commissions&#8221;.  They are typically commissioned as captains (O-3). They do not &#8220;rise through the ranks&#8221; like ordinary officers and enlisted personnel but are able to increase rank from O-3 on up.<br>
In most cases, medical doctors have their education paid for by the US government for agreeing to serve in the military upon graduation from medical school.<br>
In general, officers are NOT harassed due to their status as officers in the military.</p>

		<p>America is no longer a white country, look at who are your biggest stars and icons, Obama, Oprah, Tiger Woods, Rihanna, Will Smith, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dog, 50, Jayzee, Kenya West, Michelle and on and on.</p>
<p>You have very few sane white people in government, your media is insane, your economy is fading and now the army is destroyed from within.</p>
<p>Amnesty and open borders will add up to one hundred million more immigrants and then you will see Obama&rsquo;s coronation.</p>
<p>Look at UK, seems like the Saudis&rsquo; money work, a lot of UK is owned by muslim oil money, I bet a lot is owned by them too in America.</p>
<p>Glory to Russia, the last white christian stronghold.</p>

<p>Chicago Bantus do threaten to riot, from time to time ESPECIALLY if Jessie Jackson is ready to egg them on. Also, don&rsquo;t forget ex-Black Panther Bobby Rush now sits in Congress and wants to strip all Americans of their Second Amendment rights.<br>
There is one bright spot in all this: As you may know, SCOTUS is going to hear the Second Amendment case, McDonald v. Chicago, this term. This case is expected to result in the incorporation of the Second Amendment against states and municipalities. That means Chicago&rsquo;s draconian gun control laws could be struck down.</p>
<p>If that happens, whites in Chicago are going to legally purchase guns like groceries. Then, there will be less fear of criminals, which in Chicago - as elsewhere- tend to be Bantus and mestizos.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in Chicago now writes:</p>
<p>Bobby Rush and Jessie Jackass Jackson are old men now, they are hardly threats to be successful rabble rousers - Jessie has successfully got one son a Anneiser Bush beer distributorship and another a US Congress seat - there is one new Black Rabble rouser on the scene - State Rep. James Meeks - good his Youtube videos they are very amusing. Of course we had the crazed Black Liberation theology preacher Jeremiah Wright, but he seems marginalized, to his $5 million estate in all White Tinley Park.</p>
<p>With Blacks in Chicago - our strategy has been to get them away from us, we get away from them&hellip; anytime anyone is forced to be around them, you go for private security forces, private schools or no children. It&rsquo;s fine to live here as a young single adult - or live the lifestyle of a gay person - choose activities and buildings that Blacks just don&rsquo;t do - Black bantus aren&rsquo;t at the art museums, opera.</p>
<p>As for the 2nd Amendment gun, Constitutionalists who think this will somehow &#8220;save Chicago&#8221; America, nahhh. Don&rsquo;t let low life Blacks or Mestizos have guns or really much of our former White Republic&rsquo;s Constitutional rights. </p>
<p>And religion Righ Judeo Christian, right wing White Christians are noticeably not here either - and that&rsquo;s a good thing. If you know of any die hard Right to Life folks, please keep them away from Chicago. We need strict birth control, population control and the news is pretty good here - Black birth rates are way down - and we&rsquo;ve stop giving them free public housing near downtown - they are being pushed out to Indiana.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s rough being in areas with lots of Black Bantus - but, you learn to adjust and thankfully Black Bantus manage to drive away so many White idiots.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the armed forces are kicking out gays and lesbians who are &#8220;detrimental to good order and discipline&#8221;, but continue to promote diversity and the absurd notion that Muslims can serve in the armed forces without causing the same problems.</p>

		<p>I agree complete with Hassan.  Muslims should &#8220;rise up&#8221;.  Once they have risen up and put their shoes and jackest on, they should leave the Western nations they had no part in creating, never to return.</p>

		<p>I really believe we cannot escape it anymore, we must ask ourselves this question: are we going to let the ideology of multiculturalism destroy America, and the rest of the West, by allowing it to sabotage our armies, like this?</p>
