<h1>The Washington Times&rsquo; Confederate (Fifth) Columnist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sue Sturgis, Institute for Southern Studies, November 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A column by Wesley Pruden that appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s Washington Times is generating anger and controversy because of its views on race and President Obama.</p>
<p>Writing critically about Obama greeting the Japanese emperor with a deep bow, a move the State Department said was meant to show respect, Pruden opined:<blockquote>Mr. Obama, unlike his predecessors, likely knows no better, and many of those around him, true children of the grungy &rsquo;60s, are contemptuous of custom. Cutting America down to size is what attracts them to &#8220;hope&#8221; for &#8220;change.&#8221; It&rsquo;s no fault of the president that he has no natural instinct or blood impulse for what the America of &#8220;the 57 states&#8221; is about. He was sired by a Kenyan father, born to a mother attracted to men of the Third World and reared by grandparents in Hawaii, a paradise far from the American mainstream.</p>
<p>He no doubt wants to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; by his lights, but the lights that illumine the Obama path are not necessarily the lights that illuminate the way for most of the rest of us.<br>
</blockquote>The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America reported on the column, which triggered a storm of critical commentary around the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Steve Benen at Washington Monthly slammed Pruden as part of a persistent &#8220;Know-Nothing strain&#8221; in U.S. politics. Left in Alabama called the column &#8220;Racist, Xenophobic, and Clueless.&#8221; And Pam&rsquo;s House Blend blogger Pam Spaulding  &mdash;  a civil rights advocate and board member of the Institute for Southern Studies, publisher of Facing South  &mdash;  bluntly denounced what she called Pruden&rsquo;s &#8220;miscegenation analysis&#8221; as &#8220;racist bullsh*t.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Pruden  &mdash;  a Little Rock, Ark. native who once covered the civil rights movement for Dow Jones&rsquo; now-defunct National Observer  &mdash;  has generated controversy over his views on race and politics.</p>
<p>Four years ago, while still serving as the Washington Times&rsquo; editor-in-chief, Pruden wrote another controversial column in which he denounced the U.S. Senate for unanimously approving a resolution apologizing for failing to enact a federal anti-lynching law during the height of Jim Crow-era violence. He accused the resolution&rsquo;s sponsors  &mdash;  Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and George Allen (R-Va.)  &mdash;  of putting on a &#8220;demonstration of manufactured remorse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pruden has also at times openly expressed sympathy for Confederate causes, as the Southern Poverty Law Center reported in a 2003 story about the Washington Times&rsquo; promotion of extremist views. After Pruden was promoted from managing editor to editor in chief in 1992, he gave an interview to Southern Partisan, a pro-Confederate political magazine:<blockquote>After singling out the Southern culture warrior, Sen. Jesse Helms, as a political hero, Pruden bragged about his great-grandmother shooting a Union cavalryman and boasted that the Times was the most &#8220;in-your-face&#8221; conservative newspaper in America. When Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday rolls around every year, he said, &#8220;I make sure we have a story&#8221;  &mdash;  especially because the occasion &#8220;falls around Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>In 1997, Pruden hired as the Times&rsquo; assistant national editor the Georgia-born Robert Stacy McCain  &mdash;  a member of the neo-Confederate League of the South, a pro-secessionist organization that SPLC classifies as a hate group for its defense of segregation and slavery. With Pruden&rsquo;s approval, McCain began covering conferences sponsored by American Renaissance, a white nationalist journal, and reprinting excerpts from the journal in the paper&rsquo;s culture section.</p>
<p>And in 1998, Pruden spoke to the neo-Confederate United Daughters of the Confederacy at the Manassas Battlefield Park in Virginia, praising them for their efforts to &#8220;cherish and protect and preserve the heritage of our great Southern people.&#8221; As SPLC reported:<blockquote>Concluding with a flourish, Pruden said &#8220;Southerners .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hold loyalty to two countries in our hearts.&#8221; The second country is one &#8220;baptized 137 years ago on this very field in the blood of First Manassas, a country no longer at the mercy of the vicissitudes in the tangled affairs of men, a country that lives within us, a country that will endure for as long as men and women know love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God bless America, God bless the Confederate States of America, and God bless you all.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Loyalty to the pro-slavery CSA? What does that say about Pruden&rsquo;s instinct for what America is about?</p>

		<p>So Pruden&rsquo;s critics fall back on the worn-out whine that anyone who&rsquo;s proud of Southern roots is a raving racist scared silly about miscegenation, when the real criticism regards Obama&rsquo;s upbringing and lack of understanding of traditional American values.  I personally believe that, by this time, Obama should know that bowing to the emperor is disapproved by the vast majority of Americans, and to watch him do so appears to be a slam at the very founding concepts of our nation.  We don&rsquo;t bow to any crown!!</p>

		<p>Pruden soars in this guest editorial!  I have always appreciated his work and generally agree with his point of view and conclusions.<br>
If Wes has also earned the emnity of the stupid SPLC, then I will have to consider him a literary giant.</p>

Why do people have difficulty facing the fact that President Obama is the archetype African American. His black father impregnated his white mother and abandoned her to rear the child with the aid of her white relatives.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t fit the black American stereotype (or should I say narrative), nothing does.</p>

		<p>Obama is primping himself (or is the better word PIMPING himself?) to be declared a citizen of the world, and afterward the messiah leading the world to peace, prosperity, and socialist utopia.  He ingratiates himself and belittles America to gain favor with the world national leaders in hopes they will support his claim.  (we can hardly say of Obama that he is belittling &#8220;his own&#8221; country because he is NOT of this country and never was) </p>

		<p>The World Net Daily is reporting today (Nov.19) that the Washington Times (WT) will be laying off staff and editorial board members and may also close for good in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the WT has been losing money for years.  That I suspect is true.  However, we may have a &#8216;back story&rsquo; here that has yet to come out.  Also reported is that the WT may go with a straight* website based paper and continue its operations.</p>

		<p>The Institute for Southern Studies, eh?  How about the institute for tearing down what all true Southerners hold dear?  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a more appropriate name for this abominable trendy organization?  And since when is the UDC a &#8220;neo-Confederate&#8221; organization? It is a memorial organization that was established in 1894 by real daughters of Confederate soldiers, just as the Sons of Confederate Veterans was founded in 1896 by true sons to honor their fathers.  Everyone on the left wants to talk about being offended by something all the time.  I am highly offended by this article, and I will say categorically now that anyone who supports the fallacious claims of such a defamatory piece is a fool.  If we can&rsquo;t defend our Southern heritage in the press and by disproving such outlandish in-your-face nonsense as contained in this article, I daresay that our Confederate dead should disown us.  They were willing to stand for the principles of government by the consent of the governed at risk to more than their reputations. They put their lives on the line for their homeland.  I only wish we had the same ability now to stick together against our enemies as those men did back then.  We won&rsquo;t come to our senses before it&rsquo;s too late.  We won&rsquo;t fight.</p>
<p>As far as Obama goes, is he really unaware of the proper protocol when dealing with foreign rulers or is he trying to tell us something about how he views the USA?  Does it matter?  We&rsquo;re heading for destruction either way.</p>

<p>The entire raison d&rsquo;etre of this entire articel can be laid at the feet of this one sentence. There will be NO &#8220;sympathy&#8221; (read &#8216;understanding&rsquo;)of the &#8216;Confederate Cause&rsquo; (which was actually preservation of the spirit of the original Constitutional Republic), and citing the moronic and fraudulent SPLC as a legitimate source is there big defense. </p>

		<p>As for bowing to the Emperor of Japan, it seems gauche, a diplomatic gaffe.  I&rsquo;m not sure about the exact protocol governing this situation.  But it seems to me that as two  Heads of State, they are legal equals and neither one would bow to the other.</p>
<p>I checked on this, and it gets very technical. The Japanese emperor is not precisely a Head of  State, but &#8220;Symbol&#8221; of State   &mdash;    a fine distinction that I don&rsquo;t think would matter here.  The protocol might also depend on who is receiving whom on whose territory. Perhaps in Japan, Japanese protocol would prevail. And in the USA, it would be ours. I don&rsquo;t know.  But I doubt that it would be appropriate for either to bow to the other. <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_is_the_Head_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_is_the_Head_of_Japan</a></p>
<p>When Commodore Perry was opening up Japan in 1854, he refused to bow or grovel to anyone. And he was not even an American president, just an emissary.  Generally speaking, while Americans treat everyone with  courtesy and respect, we do not bow.  To us, as a free people,  it is servile and degrading.</p>
<p>Obama is very young and green in matters like this.  It was widely pointed out when he was campaigning that he had little to no experience in affairs of state,  and here we&rsquo;re seeing it.</p>

		<p>Wes Pruden?   </p>
<p>Perhaps someone in the AR community can fine tune my memory on this topic, but didn&rsquo;t Pruden have a substantial role in the firing of Sam Francis, following his appearance and great speech at the first American Renaissance Conference?</p>
<p>If my memory serves me correctly, I seem to remember reading or listening to Sam Francis as he summarized the treachery by his fellow white men that ended his great career at the Washington Times - and I think old Wes here was part of that outrageous and dastardly deed.</p>
<p>Can anyone help confirm this recollection?    If true, then this latest effort by Wes Pruden to stand up like a white man with a spine is pretty lame and hypocritical.</p>

		<p>I grew up in the heart of liberal looney-land, New York City, but have lived now in various Southern States for years, including Alabama. From what I&rsquo;ve seen first-hand of blacks, and from wht I&rsquo;ve read about the Civil War and southern history, all I can say is that many ways the South was right.  Unfortunatley blacks function poorly in developed societies, and the federal government did go bad in the past, and  especially with Obama at the helm, has the potential to do so again. </p>

		<p>Wes Pruden fired Sam Francis in 1995 for - in part - speaking at the 1994 AR conference. I stopped reading the Washington Times after that and will not shed any tears for Pruden or his newspaper.</p>
<p>Nothing Pruden wrote about Obama is actually wrong. But nothing Sam wrote was wrong either. When the thought police came after Sam, Pruden didn&rsquo;t just run and hide, he helped them destroy a great man. What did Wes expect? That they wouldn&rsquo;t target him because he did thier bidding at one time?</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Souza claimed in one of his recent books, &#8220;The End of Racism,&#8221; that western Africa was superior to western Europe in 1500.  That&rsquo;s all I need to know about him.</p>

		<p>I think Obama is the most UN-American President ever elected. As already stated, he is not mainstream America and has no taste for what being American about.  His agenda to to take US to the UN/EU/global international legal/banking utopian dreams of his father/ancestors.  There is nothing of US heritage in him and he is proud of this. It has become ever clear that the whole diversity/minority/legislated gambit is really about destruction of white US heritage.  The hatred is in &#8216;their eyes&rsquo; not ours. Everything else is linguistic frontage/trim for the obfuscation of truth.  V</p>

 I second Luke&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s a fact that the late, great Sam Francis was fired<br>
by the Washington Times; I seem to recall that the perpetrator<br>
is Mr. Pruden.</p>
<p> If we&rsquo;re right, it would be highly ironic if he loses<br>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t look as if Pruden has changed his spots at all. See article over at nationofcowards.us, where he is quoted as saying (i.a.): </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dumb enough to think we live in a post-racial world. Bigots and racist idiots will always exist. They will always call for racial separation and discrimination every time a black man commits a crime against a white victim.&#8221;</p>
