<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091102/US.NC.Store.Shootings/">Ex-Con Charged in 4 Fatal Shootings in &#8216;Mayberry&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alysia Patterson, Comcast News, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police arrested a convicted kidnapper early Monday in the fatal shooting of four men in the town that inspired the idyllic community of Mayberry on the 1960s TV series &#8220;The Andy Griffith Show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcos Chavez Gonzalez was charged with four counts of murder in the slayings late Sunday outside Woods TV in Mount Airy, about 100 miles north of Charlotte, police said.</p>
<p>The town, population 8,700, is the hometown of Andy Griffith and has built a tourist trade on nostalgia for the show that continues to thrive in syndication.</p>
<p>The four were shot in the shadow of a water tower that says &#8220;Welcome to Mount Airy&#8221; and has a picture of Griffith and Opie, his son on the show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gonzalez, 29, was arrested without incident at a motel about 50 miles northeast of the town, Henry County, Va., Sheriff Lane Perry said Monday. Gonzalez was unarmed when he surrendered just before 4 a.m. to officers who had surrounded the motel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State prison records show Gonzalez was released more than two years ago after serving more than two years on a 2002 conviction for kidnapping a minor and a probation violation.</p>
<p>State records show the felony kidnapping charge required Gonzalez to register as a sex offender. North Carolina&rsquo;s post-release supervision of Gonzalez ended last November, Correction Department spokesman Keith Acree said.</p>

		<p>From the original story:</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson identified the victims  &mdash;  all residents of the town  &mdash;  as Victor Alfonso Martinez-Jimenez, 22; Javier Manuel Martinez, 21; Juan Manuel Martinez, 26; and Marcos Oviedo Aguliar, 21.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was wondering about that for two reasons.  First, I saw a brief TV news clip of local cops working the crime scene and was startled to notice that most of the onlookers seemed to be mestizo.  I was unaware that mexican colonization was that advanced in NC.</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m just glad it was four invaders who were killed, not four Americans.  If these people have to murder and have to be here, then by God let them murder each other&hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Watson said 16 shots were fired but the assault rifle had not been found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the corrupt media is certain the weapon was an &#8220;assault rifle,&#8221; yet it wasn&rsquo;t found so it&rsquo;s impossible to tell what the weapon was?  </p>

		<p>I started to send off an email to the writer of this story, letting her know that &#8220;assault weapon&#8221; ammo is used in many kinds of rifles, so how did she know an &#8220;assault weapon&#8221; was used?</p>
<p>But, then, I noticed she was from the AP and they&rsquo;re so fanatically far left it would have done no good at all.</p>
<p>The AP taints every story it can with its radical leftist ideology.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an unbiased printed news media anymore.  Every single one of them pursues a radical agenda, and they&rsquo;re all liars to the last person.</p>

		<p>I remember reading a long Charlotte newspaper article about 15 years ago where the writers lamented the dearth of Hispanics in their state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re happy now, but I&rsquo;m wondering if they somehow knew that this invasion was coming.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely surprised at this Hispanic infection that&rsquo;s taken root in N.Carolina, as apparently it&rsquo;s been going on there  for some time.   I recall being really shocked to read, back in the 80s, when the singer Kate Smith was ailing and then died, that she had two grasping  nieces who had married Hispanics and who were feuding over control of the  dying  singer and  over her estate. They had moved in and taken over her home in Raleigh. A tragically sordid mess to befall a beloved celebrity who had never been touched by a breath of scandal. Poor Kate!</p>
<p><b>Mooching Relatives Plague Kate Smith</b>  &mdash;   Milwaukee Sentinel <br>
 <i>&#8220;Kate Smith, whose voice brought her millions from box office and records royalties, has retired to a miserable life as a prisoner of mooching relatives in her own home. The singer&rsquo;s retirement has been turned into a horrible disaster by relatives who have become self appointed jailers.<br>
[Smith&rsquo;s sister, Helena] had  recommended that her daughter, Mrs. Rodriguez, be included as one of 3 co-conservators when she returned from living in Puerto Rico. Mrs. Rodriguez&rsquo; husband, Guillermo, believed in the occult and mysticism and experimented with mind control.&#8221; </i>   <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yhthuf7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yhthuf7</a></p>
<p> <i>&#8220;another relative [Guillermo Rodriguez]  who now lives with Miss Smith in the ailing singer&rsquo;s North Carolina home had tried to exorcise her,  smoked marijuana, and gets violent when he drinks.  The allegations are the latest in the battle between Miss Smith&rsquo;s nieces [Kathryn  Rodriguez and Suzanne Andon]  who are trying to oust each other as conservators of her estate.  Suzanne Andron claims her sister and co-conservator has been taking financial advantage of the singer.    Mrs. Rodriguez, in turn, is attempting to remove Mrs. Andron &hellip;as manager of the estate.&#8221;</i>  <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yz7cbob" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yz7cbob</a></p>
<p>As an interesing aside, on looking up references re. Kate Smith, I find that  she achieved stardom in 1931, &#8220;when she sang the controversial top twenty song of 1931:  <i>&#8216;That&rsquo;s Why Darkies Were Born&rsquo;.&#8221;  </i> <br>
That&rsquo;s hardly a song that would make anyone a star  today    &mdash;   more like a career killer!    &mdash;  <br>
  Someone had to pick the cotton,<br>
  Someone had to pick the corn,<br>
  Someone had to slave and sing,<br>
  That&rsquo;s why darkies were born.</p>

<p>Anyone dare to guess that the accused perp and the victims are all illegal? Progbably are. Sounds like a drug deal gone sour! That is how they refer to these crimes. Sour! Well, sure!!</p>
