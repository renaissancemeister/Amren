<h1>Government Data Imply High Immigrant Crime Rates</h1>

	<p>Study: Findings Contradict Older Research Showing Low Rates</p>
<p>Contact: Steven Camarota, (202) 466-8185, sac@cis.org</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (November 19, 2009)  &mdash;  Center for Immigration Studies has published a detailed report on immigration and crime based on a variety of recently released data, including some obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests. The newer government data implies that immigrants have relatively high rates of crime. This contradicts older academic research that generally found low rates of crime. The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to conflicting information and a lack of good data.</p>
<p>The report, &#8216;Immigration and Crime: Assessing a Conflicted Issue,&rsquo; is authored by Steven Camarota and Jessica Vaughan.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates that immigrants (legal and illegal) comprise 20 percent of inmates in prisons and jails. The foreign-born are 15.4 percent of the nation&rsquo;s adult population. However, DHS has not provided a detailed explanation of how the estimates were generated.</p>
<p>Under contract to DHS in 2004, Fentress, Inc. reviewed 8.1 million inmate records from state prison systems and 45 large county jails. They found that 22 percent of inmates were foreign-born. But the report did not cover all of the nation&rsquo;s jails.</p>
<p>The 287(g) program and related efforts have found high rates of illegal-alien incarceration in some communities. But it is unclear if the communities are representative of the country:</p>
<p>Maricopa County, Ariz.: 22 percent of felons are illegal aliens;</p>
<p>Lake County, Ill.: 19 percent of jail inmates are illegal aliens;</p>
<p>Collier County, Fla.: 20 to 22 percent of jail inmates and arrestees are illegal aliens;</p>
<p>Weld County, Colo.: 12.8 to 15.2 percent of those jailed are illegal aliens.</p>
<p>DHS states that it has identified 221,000 non-citizens in the nation&rsquo;s jails. This equals 11 to 15 percent of the jail population. Non-citizens are 8.6 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total adult population.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons reports that 26.4 percent of inmates in federal prisons are non-citizens. However, federal prisons are not representative of prisons generally or local jails.</p>
<p>Recent reports by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) and Immigration Policy Center (IPC) showing low rates of immigrant incarceration highlight the data problems in many studies. The 2000 Census data they used are not reliable.</p>
<p>An analysis of the data used in the PPIC and IPC studies by the National Research Council found that 53 percent of the time the Census Bureau had to make an educated guess whether a prisoner was an immigrant. The studies are essentially measuring these guesses, not actual immigrant incarceration.</p>
<p>The poor quality of data used in the PPIC and IPC studies is illustrated by wild and implausible swings. It shows a 28 percent decline in incarcerated immigrants 1990 to 2000 &ndash; yet the overall immigrant population grew 59 percent. Newer Census data from 2007 show a 146 percent increase in immigrant incarceration 2000 to 2007 &ndash; yet, the overall immigrant population grew only 22 percent.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities&rsquo; shows that 8.1 percent of prisoners in state prisons are immigrants (legal and illegal). However, the survey excludes jails and relies on inmate self-identification, which is likely to understate the number of immigrants.</p>
<p>In 2009, 57 percent of the 76 fugitive murderers most wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were foreign-born. It is likely however that because immigrants can more readily flee to other countries, they comprise a disproportionate share of fugitives.</p>
<p>Most studies comparing crime rates and immigration levels across cities show no clear correlation between the immigrant share of a city&rsquo;s population and its level of crime. This is one of the strongest arguments that immigrants do not have high crime rates. However, such studies generally measure only overall crime, not crimes specifically committed by immigrants. Also, a 2009 analysis by DHS&rsquo; Office of Immigration Statistics found that crime rates were higher in metropolitan areas that received large numbers of legal immigrants.</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2007, 816,000 criminal aliens were removed from the United States because of a criminal charge or conviction. This is equal to about one-fifth of the nation&rsquo;s total jail and prison population. These figures do not include those removed for the lesser offense of living or working in the country illegally. The removal and deportation of large numbers of criminal aliens may reduce immigrant incarceration rates because many will not return and re-offend, as is the case with many native-born criminals.</p>
<p>Some have argued that the fall in overall national crime rates since the early 1990s is evidence that immigration actually reduces crime. However, overall crime rates are affected by many factors. Moreover, the 1970s and 1980s saw crime rates rise along with immigration levels.</p>
<p>Overall incarceration rates are also a poor means of examining the link between immigration and crime. Since the 1970s, the share of the U.S. population that is incarcerated has grown almost exactly in proportion to the share of the population that is immigrant. But unless inmates can be identified as immigrant or native-born this information sheds little light on the issue of immigrant criminality.</p>

		<p>I agree with the interpretation of the data, but I wish the racial aspect would have been played up.  It&rsquo;s not that whether someone decides to &#8220;migrate&#8221; here legally or illegally that means they tend to the criminal, it&rsquo;s the race of those migrating.</p>

		<p>I was just reading about that black lady who is going to trial for cutting in line at a walmart and fighting and arguing with police.  As is my usual custom, I scrolled down to look at the comments to see what people ar saying about it.  This is the AOL website, and - this is something I&rsquo;ve been noticing for some time - there were no comments and no options to make comments.  Really, it seems whenever there is an issue where people might have cause to criticize black culture, the comment ability is always disabled.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I first began to notice it about 6 months or so ago and now I expect it that if the story is critical of blacks (as opposed to all other racial groups) more often than not comments are not allowed.</p>

		<p>What race ? White, black, mixed, Indian? Chinese? Are Indians(India) crime free compared with Nigerians. This is a simplistic article. Blacks are crime prone. Beyond that, do we know anything?</p>

		<p>It may take a genius to figure out the statistics but not the general problem with immigration.</p>
<p>Not everyone that immigrates to a new country is looking for a better life. Plenty of people leave a country because things are getting a little hot for them back home and they need to find a new area for their criminal activity. </p>
<p>There was a rapest in one city where I lived in years past and they were going to cut his head off back in his home country. Immigration to anywhere would have seems a good idea to him and there were plenty of women to rape in other countries. </p>
<p>There are plenty of criminals that would rather be in an American prison rather than face justice back home. Compared to some other countries America is soft on crime so we tend to attract a criminal element. </p>

		<p>To #3. Yes, Jay, I have noticed this. The New York Times rarely allows for comments on stories which have a racial slant. When it does, it won&rsquo;t accept comments that don&rsquo;t toe the party line. I imagine all of the MSM follow this policy and I think we should take this as an indication of fear of an electorate that is increasingly becoming enlightened.</p>

		<p>It is a fact that the majority of criminals are poorly educated.  That means blacks and Hispanics, primarily.  Yes they DO commit the majority of the crimes - poverty does not breed gentility.  However, it is my contention that people who WANT to move up in life get out there and do the work to effect the change; most would rather lie around and complain, whine and moan, commit crimes to get money, and then demand guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t subsidies for their miserable lives.  Education is the answer; but, it&rsquo;s the old horse-to-water analogy; no way anyone&rsquo;s gonna MAKE &#8216;em drink.</p>

		<p>Crime and corruption are the cornerstones of Hispanic cultures and rape and murder are considered to be acceptable social norms.  These are the people the congress is flooding our country with and who they want to legalize.  I charge the congress with being accessories to every crime committed by illegals.  </p>

<p>Great insight Jay. The problem is much worse in Britain. Like an ostrage, they simply filter the race facts out of the crimes and report them as if everyone in the country were white. Freedom of speech is limited, by our standards, today in that country so you can get in trouble for speaking about race in the same way you can here. </p>
