<h1>Racial Concerns at Conn. Child Welfare Agency</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Haigh, Nashua Telegraph (New Hampshire), November 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Saturday morning ritual has been going on for the past month in Hartford&rsquo;s North End, where Lewis&rsquo; [Rev. Cornell Lewis] group &#8220;The Men of Color,&#8221; block by block, is trying to persuade residents of this economically depressed, predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhood to refuse services from the state&rsquo;s child welfare agency.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re attempting to create &#8220;A No-DCF Zone,&#8221; referring to the Department of Children and Families, to draw attention to what they say is a lack of minority input into a state agency whose clientele are more often black and Hispanic than not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While families are not required to cooperate with a DCF investigation, typically prompted by a tip about alleged abuse or neglect, Hamilton [DCF Commissioner Susan Hamilton] said the agency might have to take the adversarial step of seeking a court order against a particular family in order to complete an investigation if the &#8220;No-DCF Zone&#8221; protest persists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hamilton, who is white, said she&rsquo;s also concerned there is a perception that her agency, which she has run since 2007, is not racially sensitive. She said issues surrounding the race and ethnicity of DCF employees and clients are taken very seriously.</p>
<p>DCF has among the highest rates of minority hiring in state government. Statistics from 2008 show 47 percent of its 3,400 employees are minorities, including 30 percent of managers. According to U.S. Census estimates for 2008, more than 84 percent of Connecticut&rsquo;s population of 3.5 million are Caucasian.</p>
<p>&#8220;I somewhat question where they&rsquo;re getting the data in terms of there not being enough diversity at upper levels because I don&rsquo;t think the numbers reflect that,&#8221; Hamilton said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s a concern that I have because if there&rsquo;s a perception out there that we&rsquo;re not diverse simply because the commissioner doesn&rsquo;t fall into one of those categories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the employee makeup of the agency, the Men of Color and other groups said they are not satisfied and question the amount of input those minority workers actually have at the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&rsquo;t have diversity at the top, you don&rsquo;t have the cultural competency to deal with the issues that are going on,&#8221; said Scot X. Esdaile, president of the Connecticut NAACP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, DCF is facing complaints of disparate punishment of minority workers at the Connecticut Juvenile Training School in Middletown, a DCF facility for troubled youth where Lewis is employed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s worse than in the South,&#8221; said Anthony Gaunichaux of Middletown, a past employee at CJTS, who joined Lewis at Thursday&rsquo;s meeting with the governor&rsquo;s office. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got cases right here, I&rsquo;ve got cases of people that have been unjustly treated at CJTS and they&rsquo;re all black males.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This guy Cornell Lewis is a joke (are any of these race hustlers not reverends?). Nobody but the few ex felons that he parades around the city with take him seriously. All he will accomplish with this boycott of DCF is the abuse of a few more minority youth.</p>

		<p>So they admit most of their clients are Black or Hispanic, as well as a good portion of the workers&hellip; Why is it under the very nose of those &#8216;working so hard to build an inclusive community&rsquo;, that there is the most exclusion? </p>

<p>Connecticut is 87% white and the Connecticut DCF is only 53% white.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not going to stop until every white person is eliminated.</p>

		<p>Do they need volunteers? I&rsquo;ll gladly go door to door for them to persuade them to refuse services from the state. I&rsquo;ll also try to persuade them to refuse to enter White neighborhoods, go to White schools, shop in White stores because of the lack of blacks in those places. That will teach those White &#8220;debbles&#8221;! </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love those White liberals in Conn. getting their faces rubbed in their own do-do! That Susan Hamilton is just falling all over herself trying to prove that her and her agency aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racissss&#8221; to those worthless ghetto thugs. Put on your seatbelt hon, it&rsquo;s gonna be a bumpy ride!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Race hustlers upset because welfare commissioner is white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s expected.  Nothing unusual in that reaction.</p>
<p>They only believe diversity is there strength if it means including a black from another part of town.</p>

		<p>They are &#8220;boycotting&#8221; investigations of crimes against children (basically the same thing as &#8220;boycotting&#8221; the police whenn investigating a crime that took place in your home).</p>
<p>How many &#8220;boycotters&#8221; are living on welfare? Are they thinking of boycottong AFDC? rent subsidies? free health care? free education??</p>
<p>The root problem is low functioning ghetto dwellers who are uderstanbdably upset about being essentially wards of the state. </p>
<p>for all that, their complaints should be addressed: such agencies are dumping grounds for grunts and incompetents.<br>
But some of the worst incompetents may be AA hires, so real scrutiny could backfire&hellip;<br>
it may </p>

		<p>     This white woman is upset that her black brothas are lining up against her. what a joke. I am sure she has been shilling for the brown welfare state for years. As for me . I think it couldnt&rsquo; have happened to a better person.</p>

		<p>Excellent, they should indeed refuse to accept welfare money.  Then maybe they&rsquo;d actually go out and get a job instead of leeching off the white man while claiming he&rsquo;s &#8220;keeping the brothas&rsquo; down.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Haven&rsquo;t these clowns figured out that they are nothing but a drain on what&rsquo;s left of Amerikwa. Still they want more entitlement&rsquo;s and blame their collective failure on white&rsquo;s.<br>
I think the white population is finally waking up to the fact that diversity is the bomb that&rsquo;s going to kill us all.</p>
