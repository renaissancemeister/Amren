<h1><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18093-chinese-challenge-to-out-of-africa-theory.html">Chinese Challenge to &#8216;Out of Africa&rsquo; Theory</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil McKenna, New Scientist, November 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jin Changzhu and colleagues of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology in Beijing, announced to Chinese media last week that they have uncovered a 110,000-year-old putative Homo sapiens jawbone from a cave in southern China&rsquo;s Guangxi province.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If confirmed, the finding would lend support to the &#8220;multiregional hypothesis&#8221;. This says that modern humans descend from Homo sapiens coming out of Africa who then interbred with more primitive humans on other continents. In contrast, the prevailing &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; hypothesis holds that modern humans are the direct descendants of people who spread out of Africa to other continents around 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The study will appear in Chinese Science Bulletin later this month.</p>
<p><b>Out of China?</b></p>
<p>&#8220;[This paper] acts to reject the theory that modern humans are of uniquely African origin and supports the notion that emerging African populations mixed with natives they encountered,&#8221; says Milford Wolpoff, a proponent of the multiregional hypothesis at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Others disagreed. Erik Trinkaus, an anthropologist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, questioned whether the find was a true Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to keep in mind that &#8216;Homo sapiens&rsquo; for most Chinese scholars is not limited to anatomically modern humans,&#8221; he says. &#8220;For many of them, it is all &#8216;post Homo erectus,&rsquo; humans.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I will wait for the genetic evidence on this. The Chinese have great cultural pride and this may bias the study. In fact, the discovery of ancient white colonies in present day China is still a sore point with Chinese political authorities. </p>
<p>One of the sustaining beliefs among Chinese speakers, north and south, is that they are an ethnic family. Their genes say otherwise. Northern and southern Chinese appear to be separate as northern and southern Europeans  &mdash;  with only political fictions and Beijing&rsquo;s power holding them together.</p>

		<p>The name Africa is too laden with negative connotations. Our ancestors may have evolved in the territory now known as Africa but it is unfair to whites to associate our ancestors with today&rsquo;s Africans. Find another name for that ancestral territory.</p>

		<p>But let&rsquo;s not forget that a few years ago, mummies were discovered in China, that actually had blond hair and green or blue eyes. So China, or at leat part of that vast country, were not always populated by humans we today call Asians or Asiatics, but people of Nordic or Indo-European type!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You need to keep in mind that &lsquo;Homo sapiens&rsquo; for most Chinese scholars is not limited to anatomically modern humans,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>I would be interested to learn just how he defines &#8220;anatomically modern humans&#8221;.  Last I heard, there is no precise definition because, each time they try to come up with one, it either must include Neanderthals or exclude Australian Aborigines.</p>

		<p>  This finding seems to confirm the theory of the late reviled Dr. Carlton Coon, anti-Boaz Havard Anthropologist. Wikipedia has this quote:<br>
&#8220;Coon hypothesized that modern humans, Homo sapiens, arose five separate times in five separate places from Homo erectus, &#8220;as each subspecies, living in its own territory, passed a critical threshold from a more brutal to a more sapient state&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t called Africa then, when God created the heavens and the earth, so just because it is called Africa now, does not mean we all descended from blacks.  Where on earth is the proof of that?  I believe there was a separating of people at some time for some reason, I am sure it was God who did that, but no reason at all to believe black types as they look today formed any great civilizations.  I mean,why can they not repeat that anywhere in the world of today with more help and financing than they could ever have had any time in history?</p>

		<p>Even if humans arose in Africa why does that mean we evolved from blacks? Don&rsquo;t most experts believe, rather, that all races, including blacks, evolved from a common ancestor? Just to illustrate, chimpanzees, often called our closest primate relatives, have &#8220;white&#8221; skin and straight hair, even though they are native to Africa. </p>
