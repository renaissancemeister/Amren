			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Curl, Washington Times, November 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For decades as white residents fled to the suburbs, Atlanta&rsquo;s black political establishment, led by a string of strong mayors, revived the moribund economy and so revamped the city&rsquo;s image that it earned a national reputation as &#8220;Hotlanta.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, that success  &mdash;  including a winning bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics and a slew of Fortune 500 companies relocating to the city  &mdash;  has brought white voters flocking back to the city and, for the first time in 36 years, could put a white candidate back in the mayor&rsquo;s office when voters go to the polls Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a race testing racial harmony in Georgia&rsquo;s largest city, some veteran black power brokers say their hold on power is being undercut by their past successes running the city.</p>
<p> &#8220;We haven&rsquo;t always gotten the credit for that, no,&#8221; said former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who oversaw the early days of the city&rsquo;s rebirth during the 1980s. &#8220;I brought in 1,100 companies from around the world  &mdash;  $70 billion in private investment  &mdash;  and generated more than a million new jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black mayors have occupied City Hall since 1973, but this year, a white City Council member is leading in the polls, even though two black civic leaders urged black voters to unite against her.</p>
<p>Mary Norwood, who has served on the Atlanta City Council for eight years and lives in the upscale, mostly white neighborhood of Buckhead, has been expanding her lead over the past six weeks. In a poll released last weekend by Survey USA, 46 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mrs. Norwood over several black candidates. State Sen. Kasim Reed followed with 26 percent and City Council President Lisa Borders came in third with 17 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While some in the majority-black city insist race is playing no role in the election, others say the issue is just under the surface.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Survey USA poll found Mrs. Norwood leading by a 6-to-1 margin among whites, Republicans and independents. Mr. Reed, who has been endorsed by Mr. Young, leads among blacks, who made up 59 percent of the electorate in Survey USA&rsquo;s turnout model.</p>
<p>And in a major break with past elections, a separate Insider Advantage poll on Oct. 16 reported that Mrs. Norwood was even leading among the city&rsquo;s black voters, with nearly one-third supporting her.</p>
<p>With six candidates on the Nov. 3 ballot and two write-in candidates, many do not expect any candidate to win a majority of the votes on Election Day, which means the top two finishers would compete in a runoff on Dec. 1.</p>
<p>But with only a few campaigning days left, Mrs. Norwood is nearing 50 percent in the polls and could win an outright victory on Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But between 2000 and 2006, Atlanta&rsquo;s white population grew faster than that of any other U.S. city, according to the Brookings Institution. In 2000, Atlanta was 33 percent white and 61 percent black. In 2007, the numbers were 38 percent white and 57 percent black, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black voters have been moving further and further out of Atlanta, and whites who wanted to be closer to work have been moving in,&#8221; Mr. Bullock said, noting that the city has grown by 100,000 residents since 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But this year&rsquo;s race has not split neatly along racial lines, as some prominent black politicians have stepped out to support Mrs. Norwood.</p>
<p>State Rep. Ralph Long last month endorsed Mrs. Norwood, who hails from the center of his heavily black southwest Atlanta district. He was the first black leader to back the white candidate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite honestly, the race issue has died here in Atlanta because there are more pressing issues,&#8221; said Oglethorpe University politics professor Kendra King, who has extensively analyzed the city&rsquo;s politics.</p>

<p>But almost all of that economic growth took place in the suburbs.</p>
<p><i>The Survey USA poll found Mrs. Norwood leading by a 6-to-1 margin among whites, Republicans and independents&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Sounds like St. Louis City elections.  White Republican voters have no choice but to vote for the white liberal panderers (read:  Francis Slay), or in the case of 1997, a black mulatto non-militant (Clarence Harmon).</p>

<i>&ldquo;Black voters have been moving further and further out of Atlanta, and whites who wanted to be closer to work have been moving in&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The fact that blacks are moving out is an indication that blacks are escaping blacks.</p>
<p>I hope someone from Atlanta can provide some non-pc insight into the dynamics of these changes.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think that the MSM would mention, just once, the phenomenon of whites building a civilization, city, nation - only to have blacks move there en masse and destroy it.  But no.  According the the MSM, this NEVER happens.  However, here they claim that blacks built up Atlanta only to have whites move in.  First of all, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.  Secondly, even if it&rsquo;s true, what about the thousands of cities and towns that whites built and have lost to blacks?  Not a word about that.</p>

		<p>Whites are scared about losing power, but apparently nobody cares what we think.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; for us to be concerned and worried about our displacement.</p>

		<p>Ah, the most utterly blatant of all racial double-standards&hellip;the black vote phenomenon. For blacks to desire black representation is not only expected but fully encouraged by the establishment at large. For whites to do likewise along racial lines would be instantly condemned as foulest bigotry! According to modern orthodoxy, this makes perfect sense&hellip; </p>

<p>Oh this is such nonsense. If Africans deserve credit for running the city well, does that mean they should run the city in perpetuity? And did they run it well? Was Atlanta&rsquo;s crime rate above or below that of comparable cities? How about it&rsquo;s poverty level? Why did so many Africans leave? Were they fleeing crime? Were they pursuing jobs? And why did white people come to the city? What neighborhoods did they move into? Do they feel save in most of the city? Or just some of it? </p>

<p>I live in a suburb of Atlanta. I bought a house here 15 years ago when it was mostly white, now it is mostly black (and I am packing right now to move to a small georgia town that is 80% white and very safe).</p>
<p>Atlanta has changed a lot in the last decade, it used to be the Buckhead area was very nice and safe, a popular nightlife section there had bars open till 6 am and women could walk to their car at any hour of the night without fear. Now it is &#8220;urbanized&rdquo; and no longer safe, the city combated the problem by changing the liquor laws and forcing bars to stop serving at 2 am (let&rsquo;s punish everyone for the criminal actions of a few, that decision forced the closing of some after hours clubs that had been operating without problems for 20+ years).</p>
<p>Other areas of the city have been gentrified. I believe in large part to Atlanta&rsquo;s male gay community, they liked to live &#8220;in town&#8221; and started buying up old beautiful old houses in the ghetto. The gay men could live where straight people could not, due to the fact they don&rsquo;t have kids or girlfriends/wives to worry about. Some neighborhoods became 60% gay white men and 40% black ghetto, this drove up property prices and angered the blacks living there, but when the tipping point reached, regular white couples and even some families started moving in. </p>
<p>Some gentrified neighborhoods are still risky, 75% white with 25% black ghetto elements, it is a weird mix of trendy bars/restaurants/stores and hard core ghetto elements; many of those metrosexual folks aren&rsquo;t armed but there have been some notable shootings, including citizens gunning down robbers in a hail of gunfire. The city is changing a lot and as stated, when it reaches a certain tipping point that effects property prices and rent and makes it all change faster. Yes there are still hard core &#8220;no go areas&#8221; as well.<br>

		<p>Good luck to Mary Norward. I hope Atlanta patriot&rsquo;s are spreading the word via their blogs.<br>
