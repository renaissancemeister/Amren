<h1>Alabama County Celebrates Official Obama Holiday</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Johnson, Google News, November 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The sign going on the front door at the Perry County courthouse reads: &#8220;Closed for the Obama Holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rural, mostly black county has proclaimed Monday as an official holiday celebrating the election of the nation&rsquo;s first black president, Barack Obama. It&rsquo;s one of Alabama&rsquo;s poorest counties, but it&rsquo;s sparing little during five days of festivities.</p>
<p>County employees, as well as city workers in Marion and Uniontown, will get a paid holiday Monday as government offices close, culminating a series of events including an old-fashioned civil rights rally and march, a golf tournament, a weekend carnival and a parade Monday through Marion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Located in the heart of the economically depressed Black Belt region named for its rich soil, Perry County is sparsely populated, with a little over 11,000 residents, and an unemployment rate of more than 18 percent, one of the highest in the state.</p>
<p>County Commissioner Brett Harrison, who cast the lone &#8220;no&#8221; vote when the commission voted 4-1 to set up the holiday, questions adding a paid day off in such a poor county. He said the county already had 14 paid holidays and it didn&rsquo;t seem like the right time for such an ambitious event in the middle of a recession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama holiday was proposed by Commissioner Albert Turner Jr., whose father was one of the marchers beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the 1965 &#8220;Bloody Sunday&#8221; voting rights march in Selma. Many of the marchers were voting rights activists from Marion upset about the shooting death of Jimmie Lee Jackson during an earlier demonstration in the town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We hold holidays for Columbus and for Lincoln. There&rsquo;s been no event more historic in my lifetime than the election of Barack Obama,&#8221; Turner said.</p>
<p>He said another reason for the holiday was to let the nation know the role Perry County played in protests that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act. Some of the events recall the demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re celebrating Obama. We&rsquo;re celebrating America living up to it&rsquo;s creed that all men are created equal,&#8221; Turner said.</p>
<p>Activities Friday included a jamboree at Marion Military Institute, where high school students from public and private schools in three counties had a chance to meet with representatives of colleges from across the Southeast and were given instructions on how to apply for college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The host of the golf tournament Friday, state Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said he hopes publicity surrounding the holiday will help lure new industry and jobs to the depressed region.</p>
<p>But Michael Brooks, a Judson College professor who is a Republican Party official in Perry County, wondered if the five days of events celebrating Obama&rsquo;s election wasn&rsquo;t a little too much for the small, poor county.</p>
<p>&#8220;I question whether we needed another paid county holiday in the middle of a recession,&#8221; Brooks said. &#8220;For the first year, it seems it could have been a bit more modest.&#8221;<br>

		<p>My goodness they have a holiday for him and he&rsquo;s not even dead yet. Juxtaposed to presidents day, in place of Washington&rsquo;s and Linoln&rsquo;s days, I guess it&rsquo;s fitting. We are removing the philosiphy of liberty espoused by the likes of Jefferson and Washington. It&rsquo;s no longer taught in the schools or celebrated in the town square. Soon collectiveism will be the system of government championed. A sad day.   </p>

		<p>Obama succeeded at getting elected but has failed at essentially everything since.   Why would even blacks want to celebrate such a record?</p>

		<p>To sum up: black people rallying around a black leader because of racial consciousness and loyalty. America&rsquo;s looking less &#8220;post-racial&#8221; every day.</p>

		<p>We never had a holiday devoted specifically to the remembrance of James Madison, the principal author of the United States Constitution, nor to Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.  But now we have a holiday declared for a sitting President whose accomplishments so far consist of bankrupting us with further bailouts, not getting us out of Bush&rsquo;s wars, and bringing us socialized medicine that will no doubt prove about as effective as our public schools.</p>
<p>For some people race trumps everything, and its not us here at Amren.<br>

		<p>I guess there is not much to celebrate in a poor Alabama county so the local politicians find the only thing they can think of to have a celebration. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of keep the boys happy and get re-elected because politicians are about the only people with jobs. </p>

		<p>The reality is that for 4 complete years there has been and will be a Mutt Messiah holyday celebration 24/7/365 but you white people are in the dark since its very tight lipped and ita  Black Thankg anyway so you would understand.</p>
<p>We can never thank the silver spoon screwup and his party of comrade Lincoln and of course their neocons who have gone back to being paleolibs changing their color like any good retiles.</p>
<p>Bush and Bama should on the same ticket with Steele so we reccommend Bama changing parties to he with hsi red party hero Lincoln who both worship as the greatest emancipator in world history and Bush should be named Bamas VP in 3 yrs when he runs again.</p>
<p>Bama and Bush on the GOP red party of Lincoln ticket &hellip; </p>

		<p>So in the midst of a recession the town shells out $ for another paid holiday and encourages five days of partying and goofing off?</p>
<p>This helps explain why every black-run town eventually goes bankrupt and ends up begging the white taxpayers in surrounding counties for a bailout.  </p>

		<p>Can I be the only one who has a cynical, little chuckle every time I hear some overblown nonsense about the &#8220;first black president,&#8221; who is, in fact, technically just as white as he is black. There is just an element of ironic comedy in this supposedly &#8220;historic&#8221; presidency, in which the first-black(all puns intended)is really not entirey black at all.    </p>

		<p>Oh goodie!  The blacks have found another excuse to skip out of work and school so they can riot, rape and murder and blame it all on whitey.  When the usual violence occurs like it always does at these ludicrous grandstanding events the story will be swept under the rug by the liberal media. Today is Veterans day and you can bet not one of those Obama day clowns will stop for one second and honor those that fought for their right to be stupid.    </p>

		<p>Alabama now has Obama day and Schwarzenegger in California just signed SB 572 making April 22 gay celebration day for Havey Milk in our public school systems*. Now that we&rsquo;re down to celebrating homosexual acts what&rsquo;s next? Charlie Manson day? </p>
<p>*Arnold also signed SB 54 which, despite the voter&rsquo;s overwhelming approval last year of a constitutional amendment against gay marriage, recognizes as valid marriages gay marriages from other states.</p>

		<p>No doubt the celebration will be punctuated by incidences of inappropriate outlandish attire and behavior that they will not have the brain power be embarrassed over.  Predictably,  this will be blamed on whites trying to make them look &#8216;bad&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This is the town that had to call in extra police help from Selma and Montgomery when two black families got into a fight on sunday and rioted on monday at school. The whole town was involved. We have several cities and counties in the black belt that have majority black populations and blacks have been in charge since the sixities.</p>
