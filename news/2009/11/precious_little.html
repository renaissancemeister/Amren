<h1>&#8216;Precious&rsquo; Little of Value in Ghetto Lit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan Williams, Wall Street Journal, November 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the author of books on black history and black culture, I was disappointed but not surprised. To see a working-class 30-ish black woman with a book these days is almost always to find her reading a selection from the fastest-growing segment of African-American letters, a genre called &#8220;ghetto lit&#8221; or &#8220;gangster lit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best that can be said about these books is that they are an authentic literary product of 21st-century black America. Black women are much bigger readers than black men, and gangster lit dominates the best-seller list in Essence Magazine, which calculates rankings using sales at black-owned bookstores nationwide. Recent titles shout out to the hard, fast lifestyle: &#8220;Bad Girlz 4 Life,&#8221; &#8220;Still Hood&#8221; and &#8220;From the Streets to the Sheets.&#8221; Some of the most prominent authors include Vickie Stringer, who wrote &#8220;Let That Be the Reason,&#8221; a semi-autobiographical work, while the future ghetto-lit publisher was doing seven years for drug trafficking; and Nikki Turner, who wrote &#8220;A Hustler&rsquo;s Wife&#8221; and &#8220;Death Before Dishonor&#8221; (co-authored with hip-hop star 50 Cent).</p>
<p>The black imagination as revealed in gangster lit is centered on the world of drug dealers  &mdash;  &#8220;dough boys&#8221; who are heavy with drug money  &mdash;  and the get-rich-quick rappers and athletes who mimic the druggie lifestyle. And there are lots of &#8220;ghetto-fabulous&#8221; women, referring to themselves as bitches, carrying brand-name handbags and wearing big, gaudy jewelry. Attitude and anger are everything. The dispiriting word &#8220;nigger&#8221; is used freely by black characters talking about one another. There are guns and drive-by murders; hot sex that emphasizes the pleasure of getting it on with no strings attached; women without husbands and children without fathers; people who brag about being street-smart and then drop out of school and find themselves unemployed.</p>
<p>At least two black-owned publishing houses have been created as a result of the growing market for these books. {snip}</p>
<p>This week a new movie, &#8220;Precious,&#8221; comes to the screen that is based on one of these books, a novel called &#8220;Push&#8221; by Sapphire. The depraved story focuses on an overweight black girl, sexually abused by her mother and twice made pregnant by her father. She also contracts AIDS. But even with death hanging over her she rises from that miasma to find some self-esteem. The movie features Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz and Mo&rsquo;Nique. Two titans of contemporary black culture, Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, are listed as executive producers of the movie. They have agreed to use their high public profiles to promote the film. Both have shared painful stories from their childhoods  &mdash;  Winfrey of being raped and Perry of being beaten. The movie was celebrated with awards at the Sundance Film Festival and won rave reviews at Cannes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precious&#8221; {snip} gives prominence to the subculture of gangster-lit novels, bringing them into the mainstream. Not only the best but the worst that can be said about these books is they are an authentic literary product of 21st-century black America. They are poorly written, poorly edited and celebrate the worst of black life.</p>
<p>Much as rap music {snip} has displaced jazz or soul singers on the black music charts, gangster lit now overshadows the common late 20th-century theme of black middle-class striving. As one black journalist, Nick Chiles, told an interviewer: &#8220;This phenomenon is like a weed that takes over the whole garden.&#8221; Any story celebrating the beauty and strength of black family life, the power of education, and the desire to succeed in the workplace and in business {snip} is now out of fashion.</p>
<p>{snip} It is hard to believe, but legendary black writers telling stories about the full scope of the black experience, from Langston Hughes to Toni Morrison, are being pushed aside. Inspirational books on black history or the civil-rights struggle are now for the classroom only. Even libraries now stock gangster-lit novels, because they bring new readers in the door.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year Pew released a poll showing that substantial numbers of black people now believe that there are two kinds of black people in America: those with an education, jobs and stable families and those being left behind. The poor might like gangster lit or ghetto lit for its reflection of their lives. But they are a secondary market. What makes the genre dominant at this moment is that middle-class black women have made it their escapist reading. They are the ones publishers seek to titillate and thrill.</p>

		<p>All that I think is happening here is that the long time trend of ghetto movies are making their way to literature.  The problem is, once you&rsquo;ve read one, you&rsquo;ve read them all.  Going through one of these has to be dull enough, but to read a lot of these is a symbol of having a simple mentality.</p>

<p>This &#8220;being left behind&#8221; belief implies, as usual, that someone else is to blame for their lot in life. Who is responsible for leaving them behind? The answer is that they leave themselves behind by the choices they make like dropping out of school, getting involved in criminal activity, having babies with no concern for the financial consequences and on and on.</p>

		<p><i>They are poorly written, poorly edited and celebrate the worst of black life.</i><p>So what&rsquo;s new? Black cultural products in general are &#8220;poorly written, poorly edited and celebrate the worst of black life,&#8221; not just the latest &#8220;ghetto&#8221; books.<p>For example, look at the &#8220;Blaxploitation&#8221; films of the &#8216;70&rsquo;s like &#8220;Superfly,&#8221; celebrating a drug dealer.  Or earlier films directed to black audiences like &#8220;Gang War&#8221; (1940), about a &#8220;war&#8221; between two black gangs for control of a jukebox racket.  Or 1934&rsquo;s &#8220;Harlem After Midnight&#8221; about a gang planning a kidnapping for ransom.<p>One need hardly mention contemporary &#8220;gangsta rap&#8221; with its loathsome, violent lyrics.  But blues lyrics of the early 20th Century were also violent and salacious, e.g. one song where the performer vows to shoot his &#8220;rider&hellip;just to see her jump and fall..&#8221;  To paraphrase H. Rap Brown, &#8220;Violence is as African-American as cherry pie.&#8221;</p></p></p></p>

		<p>I recently was working parttime at a major corporate bookstore. This urban lit had to be kept at the back of the store in the receiving room to keep these titles from being shoplifted. </p>
<p>While I on the book floor a black woman might approach and ask me &#8220;do you got a African-American section?&#8221; I would have to walk all the way into the back to get whichever title she wanted and make sure that the security tag was inplace. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many trashy romance novels aimed at White women featuring Vikings, Highlanders, Cowboys, and Nascar racers! If I were younger I would take up fencing, weightlifting, ale drinking, and sailing as a sure means of attracting the ladies;)</p>
<p>On an unexpected note, I had one regular customer from Pakistan who would come in to buy steamy Viking romance novels about once a month. She even wore the head covering, unattractive clothes, etc. I kept wanting to ask &#8220;What does Allah think about this?&#8221;<br>

		<p>I used to be in the used book business, and I can say without a hint of racism that books by and/or about black people are not worth anything.  Most of those black bestsellers will be selling on Amazon for a dime or less within 2 months of being released.  There are way too many copies printed to satisfy the demand.  I used to buy books by the cartful at the post office auction and would always dread finding a lot of fiction by black authors in the bottom of the bin.  These were new books too.  </p>
<p>Once I had at least a dozen brand new copies of a particular black novel listed on Amazon for 7 cents each and the author bought half a dozen of them from me.  </p>
<p>Not that novels by white authors do much better.  Books by Patterson, Crichton, Picoult, etc., eventually sell for 1 cent each on Amazon too, but at least if they&rsquo;re relatively fresh, you can get a couple of dollars for them.</p>

		<p>What Juan Williams refers to sounds like the black equivalent of Harlequin romances.  Neither genre rises to what one would call &#8220;literature&#8221;, but while the stuff targeted towards white women involves fantasies about being swept away by a tall, rugged, mysterious, and rich man the stuff targeted towards black women involves fantasies about being a gangsters&rsquo; ho.</p>

		<p>While on the topic of black literature, much of the lionized and mainstream black writing is also trash. Toni Morrison or Maya Angelou would have no  sales if the publishing and &#8220;education&#8221; industry did not heavily promote them. Students are often assigned these works. </p>

<p>Because they have been &#8216;free&rsquo; for 150 years&hellip; ? Then again this falls into the trap of assuming African Americans, and only African Americans, are uniquely challenged, in a sense, once again finding a way to deny and negate the &#8216;diverse white peoples&rsquo; - as the guy from &#8216;Resisting Defamation&rsquo; website would say. </p>

<p>Just like black-penned plays and movie scripts, 99% of which are shockingly lowbrow. </p>
<p>While leftists have always whined about the stereotypical (though still accurate) way blacks have been portrayed by white artists the fact is that blacks have been portrayed in far more demeaning depictions in black-produced movies, rap videos and sitcoms. </p>

		<p>An African-American tennant in one of my rental houses once informed me she was unable to pay the rent for the month.  The reason being she was having a book published and had to use the rent money for the publishing fee.  The title &#8220;I fell in love with my rapist&#8221;.  She was evicted not long after and I never received a copy of the book.  I&rsquo;m sure the comedy value would have been high.  She was also planning a fashion show.  The show featured free chicken and champaigne (with a $10 entry fee and security provided).  She wanted me to attend.  Surprisingly it never materialized.  I have 1000 more stories.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what Williams describes as common themes running through this &#8220;escapist&#8221; writing:</p>
<p>1) Sporting big, gaudy jewelry  <br>
2) Constantly angry; possessing a bad attitude <br>
3) Using nonstop profanity replete with gender/ethnic based slurs<br>
4) Having frequent liaisons with drug peddling lowlifes<br>
5) Getting ditched with illegitimate offspring after said liaison</p>
<p>Why is this &#8220;literary genre&#8221; considered &#8220;escapist&#8221; when the everyday life of the contemporary black woman completely mirrors these themes and behavior?</p>
<p>If your run of the mill female ghetto-dweller wanted to &#8220;escape&#8221; by reading about something they are unfamiliar with, they could try the Help Wanted section of the local newspaper, a healthy nutrition guide or maybe a primer on responsible personal finance.</p>

		<p>In Britain we still pride ourselves on good writing and take our literature quite seriously. But rarely will a book prize be up for grabs without an inclusion of at least half a dozen &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; novels being thrown into the contest. These  will usually be novels about the Asian/Black experience; and/or those caught between cultures (sometimes focusing on a  mixed race family). Needless to say the nice judges will do their utmost to see one  or two receiving its fair share of reviews, accolades and prizes. See also Zadie Smith, Monica Ali, Salmun Rushdie, Hanif Kuerishi&hellip; <br>
 But if nothing else, at least these people can write.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;250 of that in chains and only free for 150, so how can they be expected to be like Italians that came here 60 years ago&rdquo;  Because as many Africans are finding in te countries that have been set free in te last 60 years, it is not so easy to make it without European stock help.  One failed South African black farmer who had been given a previously successful white African owned farm which then soon failed in a big way, when interviewed on national TV was heard to state that &#8220;I all worked better when the whites were in charge&#8221;.</p>
<p>Soon the Africans will be demanding cash from the West again to save the starving masses (&#8220;We are suffering&#8221;).  But as some Wesren knowledgeable commentators are saying, and it is being publicicised, this is the worst action to take for they already have a culture of reliance on foreign aid and will never be able to sustain themselves unless the aid stops now. </p>

		<p>In the world of cultural relativism that most blacks occupy, those that can construct a coherent sentence, all of their cultural products have value.  Compare the creative and artistic achievements of blacks to white culture and they are in all senses pygmies.  Avoid contact with blacks at all times; no matter what we do we are always in the wrong.</p>

The idea is that we need to blend hip hop with maths or hip hop with science or hip hop with reading to keep the kiddies interested.

<p>The bottom line is that a certain population doesn&rsquo;t want to read doesn&rsquo;t want the maths and doesn&rsquo;t want the science.  When will white liberals hear their own advice, no means no!</p>

		<p>Not all Black oriented novels are about ghetto life. Terry Mc Millan&rsquo;s characters are educated Black women who have professional jobs that cannot find men of equal status to date. Other storylines include Black men leaving their Black wives to date and marry White women.</p>
