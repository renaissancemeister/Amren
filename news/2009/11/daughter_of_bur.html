<h1>Daughter of Burned Man Speaks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mariann Martin, Jackson Sun (Tennessee), November 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The daughter of a Jackson man who was doused with alcohol and severely burned last week said the most difficult thing to accept is that one of the men charged in the incident was her father&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Freddie Jones, 52, is in critical condition, on a ventilator and in a drug-induced coma at the burn unit at the Regional Medical Center in Memphis.</p>
<p>Brian Brawner, 28, Randy Leon Miller, 23, and Sam Edward Stevenson, 44, have each been charged with attempted murder and especially aggravated kidnapping in the incident. The three men are being held on $400,000 bond each.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; daughter said her dad told her that the men set him on fire because they were afraid Jones &#8220;was going to snitch to the police about some gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones has been friends with Brawner for three years, the daughter said, and the two men got along well.</p>
<p>Brawner and Stevenson were living in an apartment in the back of the house, while her father lived in the front, she said.</p>
<p>Miller may also have been staying there, she said.</p>
<p>Jones, who suffered burns over a large part of his body, was found around 9:30 a.m. Nov. 3 outside his house in the 100 block of Alexander Street, police have said.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit, Jones told police that Stevenson, Brawner and Miller assaulted him, doused him with alcohol and set him on fire between 11 p.m. and midnight on Nov. 2 inside the house.</p>
<p>Jones also told police that the three men held him against his will and threatened to shoot him if he tried to escape, the affidavit says.</p>
<p>After the three men fell asleep almost 10 hours later, Jones was able to escape, the affidavit says.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; daughter said two women and another man were also at the house and saw Jones being set on fire. She said one of the women told her that she was afraid to call for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just horrible to think what they did,&#8221; the daughter said. &#8220;I know these people; I would go to the house to check on Daddy and take him his medication.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An inmate search on the Tennessee Department of Corrections Web site shows Stevenson was on parole until Jan. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>Lt. Tyreece Miller said Stevenson was arrested on an attempted second-degree murder charge in 1995 and aggravated burglary and robbery in 2005.</p>
<p>Brawner was arrested in 2005 for possession of marijuana and crack cocaine, Miller said.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; daughter is not being identified because of concerns about her safety.</p>

		<p>Whites had better wake up and realize that having black friends ends up with violence committed by the black against the White. </p>
<p>ALWAYS. </p>
<p>How many times do we have to read stories such as this here on Amren and on the internet to know not to associate with blacks period. I have come to the conclusion that most blacks hate Whites and even those you think are your &#8220;friend&#8221;.</p>

		<p>His first mistake was thinking that any black person could be his &#8220;friend&#8221;.  Any group of people that votes in unison the way blacks do and practice racism universally the way blacks do don&rsquo;t have white friends.  They only have useful white acquaintances they haven&rsquo;t felt obliged to hurt yet. </p>

		<p>This man should have known better! He betrayed his breeding at the altar open mindedness and was rewarded for his indescretion. The endless emotional diareah about &#8220;love is everything&#8221; fails to recognize something called reality, but as our society runs out of money to subsidize stupidity this nonsense will be exposed. These men with &#8220;degraded skin color&#8221; as Lincoln called it, behaved accordingly.</p>

<p>Not having black friends is the definition of racist. Being burned alive doesn&rsquo;t compare to being a racist. When you think about it, Saying you have black friends, makes you a racist too.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous 1, you are absolutely right.  The very first time I was attacked by three blacks, I was still a young boy &amp; considered one of the three a friend.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been attacked a few times in the years since, but never by anyone I was under any illusions about.  The movies and television are used constantly to brainwash the general population to believe their implacable enemies are their friends, or at least not really a threat. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let it happen to you!  And for the love of life itself, protect your children! </p>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with having blacks as civil casual aquaintances in the work place, but for goodness sake NEVER EVER TRUST ONE, or have one for a friend. The only white people that have black friends are white women and we know what thats all about. Blacks are like captive big cats you cannot afford to get too comfortable around them. At the end of the day black culture overall is about nihilism and that merits wariness.  </p>

		<p>  Separation, nothing else will do . My 83 year old dad moved into a nice neighborhood 38 years ago . Now he is completely surrounded by Africans . What can you do ? I saw a documentary on the &#8216;92 ? Watts riot . It was on one of the liberal educational channels . Remember ? the Rodney King ordeal ? It showed young blacks dousing a balding, middle aged white man in a white shirt and tie then setting him afire . The program didn&rsquo;t even bother elaborating on it . But I did get it on VHS tape . I have always wondered about the poor fellow . Later they aired a program on my town . A delusional black, completely nuts, went to the local Walmarts hunting whites (his own words). Gunned down a middle aged couple who had worked their whole lives in mfd home industry . They had finally done well enough to get their own lot and start selling them . When the educational channel got through, the black guy was plainly the victim by their warped logic . Made me sick . They acted as if the murdered white couple didn&rsquo;t count for anything .      </p>

		<p>In ER&rsquo;s around the country, the staff will use a common formula to predict the odds of a burn victims chances of survival.</p>
<p>You just add the victims age to the total surface area burned (as a percentage of 100%).</p>
<p>Take Freddies age of 52.  If the total surface area of his body that is burned equals 48% or more, he&rsquo;s not going to make it.  i.e 52 plus 48 equals 100% probability of death.  Thats a probablity not a certainty.</p>
<p>Deep tissue injury.  Don&rsquo;t you just love diversity?</p>

		<p>The sad reality is that to have black friends is potentially dangerous.  Therefore, in spite of the fact that a particular black may be honorable, in order to safeguard one&rsquo;s life and property it is wise to forgo <i>any</i> blacks as friends, other than in a social group setting.</p>

		<p>Reply to AVGDUDE at #2:</p>
<p>Your post was brief, but beautiful. Whites don&rsquo;t have black &#8220;friends&#8221;, even if they THINK they do. The best possible advice I can give my fellow Whites is to avoid blacks whenever possible. Give them a wide berth and don&rsquo;t place yourself in harms way. Obviously you have to interact and communicate with them at your place of employment but keep things brief and civil, nothing more. Set a firm boundary and never let things go beyond that. Blacks are not just racist against Whites but a great many are genuinely disturbed and ticking time bombs. I have seen blacks suddenly break out into hysterical bursts of anger for no reason. No other race is quite like this. It is also my experience that blacks, especially black males are very immature. Just stay away from them. period.  </p>

		<p>If Mr. Jones was the owner of the house, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a very bright idea to rent out an apartment to a couple of felons. Obviously, the man does not deserve to be burned half to death, but if the tables were turned and three white felons did this to an upstanding middle class black citizen; Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton would be tattooed on our brains in a never ending story on TV. </p>
<p>I have some black co-workers, but that is as far as the acquaintance goes. They have not, nor will they ever visit my house. If I am on an assignment where a co-worker is black, I will talk about the weather, sports, etc., but NOTHING about my personal life. </p>

		<p>Howard you make some good points about renting out your house, but the government makes it difficult to say no without a possible lawsuit.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the government  was even subsidizing their rent.  The government is shoehorning blacks into white neighborhoods, schools, etc.  Take any white neighborhood and it is only a matter of time before businesses are threatened to hire blacks even if no blacks live in the area.<br/>
Blacks are often subsidized with rent vouchers and landlords are often threatened if they turn them down.  The articles are ofthen sketchy as to the circumstances.  But you are right about if the colors were reversed, CNN, Sharpton, Jackson, the NAACP and even Obama would be commenting on this story.</p>

		<p>This dousing of persons [white] with a flammable liquid is a &#8220;growth business&#8221;? What is is up with that? Seems to be I read more of this occurring more and more! Maybe it is an uncommon thing that has now become popular. &#8220;Snitch&#8221; they call it. I think the kid in FLA [?] had the same thing happen to him. Set afire with rubbing alcohol or such.</p>

		<p>Back in the 70&rsquo;s, a white woman in Boston ran out of gas while driving through the inner city. She took a gas can from her car and walked to a gas station to get some gas. On her way back to her car she was confronted by 3 or 4 black punks who proceeded to beat her, then poured the gas over her and set her on fire. She died of her burns. I still have this clipping from the newspaper.</p>

		<p>I wonder what percentage of media coverage this incident will get compared to the time when two whites did the same to a black about 15 years ago? About 1%.Does anyone remember that case?It was in the news for monthes.</p>
