<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=115230">Shooter Advised Obama Transition</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the alleged shooter in yesterday&rsquo;s massacre at Fort Hood, played a homeland security advisory role in President Barack Obama&rsquo;s transition into the White House, according to a key university policy institute document.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University <a href="/hspi/old/PTTF_ProceedingsReport_05.19.09.pdf" target="document" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"> published a document May 19, entitled &#8220;Thinking Anew  &mdash;  Security Priorities for the Next Administration: Proceedings Report of the HSPI Presidential Transition Task Force, April 2008  &mdash;  January 2009,&#8221;</a> in which Hasan of the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine is listed on page 29 of the document as a Task Force Event Participant.</p>
<p>Hasan received his medical degree from the military&rsquo;s Uniformed Services University School in Bethesda, Md., in 2001.</p>
<p>Noting that the Obama administration transition was proceeding, the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute report described on the first page the role of the Presidential Transition Task Force as including &#8220;representatives from past Administrations, State government, Fortune 500 companies, academia, research institutions and non-governmental organizations with global reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslims should stand up and fight the aggressor,&#8221; Hasan said about America before he and possibly other Muslim soldiers at Fort Hood shot 43 fellow soldiers, killing 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said Muslims had a right to attack&#8221; the U.S., said Col. Terry Lee, who worked with Hasan at the Texas post, where the devout Sunni Muslim refused deployment. &#8220;He said Muslims shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting Muslims,&#8221; he added. &#8220;He was very clear on that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think things have evolved to a point, where we need to ask ourselves very serious questions. Among which, since a great many Muslims living among us (and not only the extremist factions) consider themselves Muslims, first and foremost, and American and Canadian only secondly&hellip; should we have Muslims in our western armies?</p>
<p>Should we allow to serve in our armed froces, Muslims who can have access to critical, or at leat sensitive information, if the way their religion works, is that they must identify as Muslims, before anything else&hellip;?</p>
<p>I can already hear the liberals saying that would be racial, or religiuos profiling but as I said, things have evolved. And this whole thing is becoming much, much larger than, say, the US against the Taliban. This conflict is morphing into a war between Islam and Western civilisation.</p>

		<p>Can anyone imagine what may have happened in WW2 had Churchill&rsquo;s Government, whilst fighting Hitler, been allowing uncontrolled German immigration to Britain?</p>
<p>What may have happened if the British people were punished for speaking out about Nazism and German immigrants given special treatment and an Equalities body to promote their interests, government funds and posts in Government and their beliefs/culture given equality with that of the British?</p>
<p>How about Nazi protests, with police protection but anti-Nazi sentiments branded &#8220;hate crime&#8221; followed by severe punishment.</p>
<p>How about the right to wear Nazi uniforms and celebrate Nazi ideology whilst banning any British celebrations for fear of offending the Germans?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you. We would have lost.</p>
<p>Just like we will lose unless people start waking up - in Britain and America.</p>
<p>Fast.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the West is rank. The smell of defeat is in the air.</p>
<p>Not at the hands of Islamists, we could squash them.</p>
<p>No, at the hands of OUR OWN Quisling politicians.</p>

		<p>This is shocking news&hellip;not really! We all know that Obama is a Muslim sympathizer anyway. </p>

		<p>How does Hindu dominated India handle this?</p>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s and lots of Muslims in India - there just isn&rsquo;t the racial, chip on the shoulder problem Muslims have in White countries.</p>
<p>I think the Indian military is divided up along caste lines - so Muslims don&rsquo;t get much there.</p>
<p>I do see that Muslims commit horrible mob violence atrocities against Hindus in India and the response (which seems to work) is for Hindu mobs to return the favor, desecrate Muslim holy sites, shout vile things about the Prophet before burning Muslim shops, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look like a viable option for Whites in USA, Canada, Western Europe - but certainly an option for Whites in Central, Eastern Europe.<br>

		<p>&#8220;He said Muslims shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting Muslims&#8221;.  And Westerners should not stop them killing each other.  Let them get on with it as they work their way into the 21st Century from the 12th one they are living in now.  But most importnat do not let them live amongst us civilisd people until they accept our way of life unconditionally.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember the stink raised by the MSM and CAIR when someone questioned the wisdom of Bush being guarded by a Muslim secret service agent? BTW, this happened AFTER 9-11.</p>
