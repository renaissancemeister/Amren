<h1>District Nixes Cash-For-Grades Fundraiser</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Bonner, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Selling candy didn&rsquo;t raise much money last year, so a Goldsboro middle school tried selling grades.</p>
<p>However, the fundraiser came to an abrupt halt today after a story in The News &amp; Observer raised concerns about the practice of selling grades.</p>
<p>Wayne County school administrators stopped the fundraiser, issuing a statement this morning.</p>
<p><b>Learn the trick</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday afternoon, the district administration met with [Rosewood Middle School principal] Mrs. Shepherd and directed the following actions be taken: (1) the fundraiser will be immediately stopped; (2) no extra grade credit will be issued that may have resulted from donations; and (3) beginning Novermber 12, all donations will be returned.&#8221;</p>
<p>A $20 donation to Rosewood Middle School would have gotten a student 20 test points  &mdash;  10 extra points on two tests of the student&rsquo;s choosing. That could raise a B to an A, or a failing grade to a D.</p>
<p>Susie Shepherd, the principal, said a parent advisory council came up with the idea, and she endorsed it. She said the council was looking for a new way to raise money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shepherd rejected the suggestion that the school is selling grades. Extra points on two tests won&rsquo;t make a difference in a student&rsquo;s final grade, she said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong to think that &#8220;one particular grade could change the entire focus of nine weeks,&#8221; Shepherd said.</p>
<p>State education officials, who typically shy from talking about grading at individual schools, were not pleased to hear of Rosewood&rsquo;s effort.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tight state and local budgets have put extra pressure on schools to raise their own money. Teachers giving extra test credit to students who bring in classroom supplies is a longstanding practice at some schools.</p>
<p><b>The wrong lesson?</b></p>
<p>But Garland said exchanging grades for money teaches children the wrong lessons. She also said it is bad testing practice and is unfair to students whose parents can&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students should know that test grades are based on what they&rsquo;ve learned, and parents need to have a true picture of how their child is performing in class, Garland said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A parent objects</b></p>
<p>Carmen Zepp, a Raleigh parent, said there should be policies against offering students test credit for anything other than what they&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>Zepp objected this year when her daughter&rsquo;s social studies teacher at Knightdale High School had students bring to school tissues and hand sanitizer. The supplies counted for 25 percent of a &#8220;supply check&#8221; grade.</p>

<p>A $20 donation buys 10-point credits to be used on two tests of the student&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>A $30 donation buys the test points and admission to a 5th-period dance.</p>
<p>A $60 donation buys students test points, the dance invitation, and a &#8220;special 30-minute lunch period with pizza, drink and the choice to invite one friend to join them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Photo ops with Rosewood principal Susie Shepherd, the vice principal, and a home room teacher go for $75. The photos will be posted on a school bulletin board and on the school&rsquo;s Web site.</p>

		<p>Based on the demograhics of Rosewood Middle School, I&rsquo;d say this looks like like a Jackson/Sharpton style shakedown of white kids by holding their grades hostage. In any case, Susie Shephard is on paid administrative leave until December at which time she will &#8220;retire&#8221; from the skool sistema.</p>

		<p>They left out one action that should have been taken: Firing this principal. What kind of example is this to teach these kids? No wonder American kids all falling behind other nations. How dare this woman allow these kids to think they can &#8220;buy&#8221; grades. In the long run, this does much more damage if they don&rsquo;t know the material, and as a so called educator, she should know this very well. IMO, schools are dumbed down enough. They shouldn&rsquo;t need to buy points in the first place. Appalling!</p>

		<p>Why would kids pay for grades when the vast majority cheat anyway? This is too funny for words. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of situations where black kids are rewarded with gifts of name brand clothes and other bling just for showing up to class. <br>
The concept of buying grades realy shows the incompetance of the administrator and how much blacks value an education.</p>

		<p>Extra credit for homework or quizzes is also adding error to the grade. If two students perform equally ont he final exam, why should the one who tried harder  or who knew more mid year, get a better grade, unless there is some indicationt aht he still knows more at the end of the year?<br>
 <br>
If the good grades on quizzes and homework, truly makes him know more at the end of the year, then there must be some test that can prove it. If such a test exists use that at the end of the year along with the final exam, and ignore the grades from the quizzes and homework performed.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t something like this a tale-within-a-tale in &#8216;Tom Sawyer&rsquo; about learning chunks of scripture?</p>
<p>But THERE one has to learn something, right?</p>
<p>NOW TRY THIS: <br>
All adequately-educated Americans should know the name of every State, the 2-letter form of every State [NY, FL, HI etc.,] AND be able to recognise each State from its outline.</p>
<p>OK so far? Good!  Two States would represent a problem, wouldn&rsquo;t they? Why? They LOOK like rectangles but they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t true rectangles, what are they?</p>
