			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Pitcher, London Telegraph, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I was unable to make the speech given by Lord Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, at Theos, the religion think tank, on Wednesday evening. But I hope he wasn&rsquo;t making a thinly-veiled attack on European Muslim immigrants, when he said that Europeans are more interested in material things than having children.</p>
<p>Our report has him saying this: &#8220;Where today in European culture with its consumerism and instant gratification  &mdash;  because you&rsquo;re worth it  &mdash;  where will you find space for the concept of sacrifice for the sake of generations not yet born? Europe, at least the indigenous population of Europe, is dying. That is one of the unsayable truths of our time. We are undergoing the moral equivalent of climate change and no one is talking about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Sacks was ostensibly attacking our secular, consumerist culture. But a regular canard of European racists is that the Muslim immigrant population is &#8220;out-breeding&#8221; other ethnicities. They usually add that the name Mohammed is now the most popular boy&rsquo;s name in some cities. The truth is that immigrant birth-rates settle down to mirror local trends. And the much greater pluralism of non-Muslim names is bound to make the Mohammeds stand out statistically.</p>
<p>But I worry about the Chief Rabbi&rsquo;s remark that &#8220;the indigenous population of Europe is dying&#8221;. That &#8220;indigenous&#8221; is a dangerous word, as Lord Sacks must know. Clarification please.<br>

							<i>London Telegraph, November 5, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The leader of Britain&rsquo;s Jewish community claimed the continent&rsquo;s population is in decline because people care more about shopping than the sacrifice involved in parenthood.</p>
<p>He blamed atheist &#8220;neo-Darwinians&#8221; for Europe&rsquo;s low birth rate and said religious people of all denominations are more likely to have large families.</p>
<p>The Chief Rabbi, who entered the House of Lords last week, made his comments in a lecture on religion in the 21st century hosted by Theos, the public theology think-tank, on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Lord Sacks said that faith had survived so far because it could provide answers to mankind&rsquo;s eternal search for meaning in life  &mdash;  unlike the market, the state, science or philosophy, which underpin modern liberal democracies.</p>
<p>He claimed religion could continue to play an important role worldwide in the future, by engaging in debate with scientists, by campaigning on issues such as global poverty or the environment, and by discussing the nature of the common good with humanists.</p>
<p>The Chief Rabbi warned that secular Europe is at risk, however, because its moral relativism can easily be defeated by fundamentalists.</p>
<p>And he claimed that its population is also in decline, compared with every other part of the world, because non-believers lack shared values of family and community that religions have.</p>
<p>Lord Sacks said: &#8220;Parenthood involves massive sacrifice of money, attention, time and emotional energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where today in European culture with its consumerism and instant gratification  &mdash;  because you&rsquo;re worth it  &mdash;  where will you find space for the concept of sacrifice for the sake of generations not yet born?</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe, at least the indigenous population of Europe, is dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the unsayable truths of our time. We are undergoing the moral equivalent of climate change and no one is talking about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Albert Camus once said, &#8216;The only serious philosophical question is why should I not commit suicide?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was wrong. The only serious philosophical question is, why should I have a child? Our culture is not giving an easy answer to that question.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Wherever you turn today  &mdash;  Jewish, Christian or Muslim  &mdash;  the more religious the community, the larger on average are their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discussing the popular secular idea that there are no absolute moral values, he said: &#8220;You cannot defend a civilisation on the basis of moral relativism.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a head-to-head contest between a moral relativist and a fundamentalist, who wins? The fundamentalist must win because he is sure he&rsquo;s right, and you are not sure he&rsquo;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that although the war on terror had been portrayed by Western politicians as a &#8220;battle of ideas&#8221;, there is little hope that Islamists who believe they owe allegiance to God would be swayed by talk of freedom or democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The place for religion is in civil society, where it achieves many things essential to liberal democratic freedom. It sanctifies marriage and the family and the obligations of parenthood, and it safeguards the non-relativist moral principles on which Western freedom is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be religion that is dying, it may be liberal democratic Europe that is in danger, demographically and in its ability to defend its own values.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Sacks, who has been Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth since 1991, described the modern phenomenon of &#8220;angry atheists&#8221; as the &#8220;intellectual equivalent of road rage&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said that more respectful dialogue is needed between religious groups and the secular world.</p>
<p>&#8220;All peace depends on compromise and that is why peace comes to seem to some religious groups to be a form of betrayal, and that is why peacemakers get assassinated.&#8221;<br>

<p>Not a canard, but a fact. Europeans are breeding at a sub-replacement level, while non-Europeans, and especially Muslims, are breeding very fast. Even if Muslims &#8220;slow down&#8221;, they still are having so many children now that their people will be a majority within a couple of decades. </p>

		<p>Yep, you can claim American Indians are &#8220;indigenous&#8221; to the US, blacks &#8220;indigenous&#8221; to Africa, Hawaiians &#8220;indigenous&#8221; to Hawaii, aborigines to Australia and so on. Muslims can make claim to &#8220;muslim land&#8221; without taking any heat. But, God forbid you should make a claim that whites are &#8220;indigenous&#8221; to Europe.</p>

<p>This &#8220;canard&#8221; is a simple fact.  It is also a fact that in the United States Hispanics are out-breeding the indigenous population, and brag about it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The truth is that immigrant birth-rates settle down to mirror local trends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is that Muslim parents are careful to keep their daughters away from the influence of Western culture, and many Muslim men marry women from the Indian sub-continent who are subject to the &#8216;local trends&rsquo; of thousands of miles away.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;canard&#8221;, defined descriptively, is a well-established truth that some people wish to pretend is a falsehood.  I base that on the fact that I&rsquo;ve never seen the word used any other way.  It&rsquo;s odd, really, but true, whenever I see that word, someone is saying that something I know to be true is actually a lie.  Is there a conspiracy somewhere?  Or is it just a convention from the Chicago Manual of Style?  </p>

		<p>So George Pitcher - Just why is it good and acceptable to call people that you favor such as  Maories or Australian aborigines &#8216;indigenous&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s unacceptable to call British people who have at least an 8000 year genetic continuity in the British Isles &#8216;indigenous&rsquo; - Just why the loaded value judgements Mr. Pitcher? <br>
 Also Mr. Pitcher, Mohammed IS the most popular boys&rsquo; name in Britain, muslim birth-rates ARE substantially higher than the indigenous, ans indigenous birth-rates HAVE collapsed - and despite what you say there&rsquo;s no sign things will change.<br>
 - As a journalist Mr. Pitcher, why do you think it&rsquo;s acceptable to decive the public?, Don&rsquo;t you think you have a duty to report the unvarnished truth and let the public make their own judgements?, Isn&rsquo;t that the highest function of journalism?</p>

<p>Well put.  Except that people like George Pitcher are not moral relativists when it comes to their liberal religion.  They will fight tooth and nail for the rights of others to take control.</p>

<p>&gt; And this is how it is likely to end, with religious fanatics exterminating one another, and everyone else.  It serves to help one understand why Marx believed that religion ought to be suppressed.  We should be able to take lessons from whatever quarter they may be.</p>

		<p>The fault does not lie with Darwinism which explicitly tells us that the winners are those who have more descendants both as individuals and as genetic groups (races). It lies with the liberal/ Marxist twisting of Darwinist thought. Thus please so not blame Darwinism. The fault lies with modern society with its unhealthy mix of leftish social mores (feminism, destruction of traditional values etc&hellip;) and excessive soul-less consumerism. </p>

		<p>And to the blogger who told us of the Hispanics &#8220;outbirthing&#8221; the white indigenous peoples of America- There is a two ways of looking at this. One- The Southwest US may be so inundated with Mexicans that they want to take over that land and make it part of Mexico. Well, they just would have defeated the purpose of leaving their indigenous homeland then, no? They would not have the rights of Americans at that point. Watch Lou Dobbs on CNN. I know you may not like the network all you AmReners but he&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air (anti-corporate Oligarchs, anti-illegal immigration, anti-cheap labor). The second scenario is that whites will unite(and I know they will although it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it sometimes)and stake their claim to lots and lots of Canadian land and Upper Midwest land in the US. White advocacy groups from America may make a deal in the not-so-distant future to have huge swaths of land from the Canadians, and all this would be backed by pro-white and pro-West politicos from Western Europe (mainly Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Nordic countries). This is not as outlandish as it seems.</p>

		<p>whiteguysrevenge, your predictions are not that far off. It seems like the Upper Midwest and Northwestern Rockies region are among the last white areas of the US. Perhaps the people of Western Canada will also desire independence from the multicultural regime in Ottawa, and seek to establish a white North American nation. The Southwest and the coasts are lost to the Latinos, and blacks will inevitably dominate the South, although Southern Whites may be able to stake a portion for themselves, perhaps somewhere in Appalachia. <br>
And of course the American Indians will seek full sovereignty, which they should do. </p>
<p>I also predict that Nunavut and Quebec will be their own nations. The only question is, will there be a US remnant? Perhaps in the Northeast and the Rust belt? Or will the US completely dissolve?</p>
<p>The future will definitely be interesting, no question about it. I believe Francis Fukuyama was incorrect in believing we are approaching the End of History.  </p>

True enough, Whiteplight.  But Marxism has become a &#8220;religion&#8221; too   &mdash;   a cult of devotees   &mdash;   in its own right. And Marxists are among among the most ruthless, determined, and unprincipled of fanatics. They don&rsquo;t care what you think, or how you feel.  They  <i>KNOW </i> they&rsquo;re right! Period! No further discussion. And they too wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill you in order to prove it.</p>
