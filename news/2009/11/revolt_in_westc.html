<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Other issues, especially taxes, no doubt ranked high in the minds of Westchester County voters, who last night in a stunning upset threw out incumbent county executive Andy Spano in favor of Republican challenger Rob Astorino by an impressive 58-42 margin. But it didn&rsquo;t help that county residents felt strong-armed by the federal government and private litigants into a controversial lawsuit settlement on low-income housing that cuts deeply into the county&rsquo;s tradition of suburban home rule on development issues  &mdash;  or that Spano reacted to voter discontent by suggesting that critics of his housing plans were racist.</p>
<p>Announced in August, the settlement calls for the county over seven years to override local zoning and other rules to force the construction of at least 750 low-income housing units, most to be located in relatively affluent towns. The intention is to increase the number of poorer minorities living in these areas. A federal judge had sided with plaintiffs&rsquo; complaints that the county had accepted federal funds but had not lived up to its talk of combating purported &#8220;segregation&#8221; based on income. (Affluent blacks and other minorities have long been welcome in many of the communities under scrutiny; as the Manhattan Institute&rsquo;s Howard Husock points out, blacks are at most slightly underrepresented in towns like Scarsdale, Harrison, and Pound Ridge compared with their overall presence in the affluent income brackets typical of those towns.) The Obama administration took credit for arm-twisting the county into going along: &#8220;This is historic, because we are going to hold people&rsquo;s feet to the fire,&#8221; said HUD deputy secretary Ron Sims, who added: &#8220;It&rsquo;s time to remove zip codes as a factor in the quality of life in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read that last line again: it&rsquo;s pretty startling. To remove zip codes &#8220;as a factor in the quality of life&#8221; in a nation  &mdash;  so that 10455 (South Bronx), 91731 (El Monte, California), and 48210 (Detroit&rsquo;s west side) have exactly the same implications for quality of life as 10021 (New York&rsquo;s Upper East Side), 90210 (Beverly Hills), and 48009 (Birmingham, Michigan)  &mdash;  would require extreme, indeed utopian, ventures into social engineering. It&rsquo;s certainly a result unachieved by Scandinavian social democracy (in which cities like Stockholm and Copenhagen include both chic, desirable neighborhoods and neighborhoods that are neither), or for that matter by the harder tyrannies of the Left. Even 50 years after Castro&rsquo;s seizure of power in Cuba, Wikipedia describes the Miramar neighborhood as &#8220;an upscale district .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one of the better parts of Havana.&#8221;</p>
<p>What kind of social engineering might be called for to remove zip code as a quality-of-life factor differentiating gritty Yonkers from leafy Yorktown, or crime-plagued Mount Vernon from calm Mamaroneck? The New York Times lays it out:<blockquote>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the county admitted that it has the authority to challenge zoning rules in villages and towns that in many cases implicitly discourage affordable housing by setting minimum lot sizes, discouraging higher-density developments or appropriating vacant property for other purposes. Westchester agreed to &#8220;take legal action to compel compliance if municipalities hinder or impede the county&#8221; in complying with the agreement.<br>
</blockquote>Not surprisingly, voters across Westchester reacted with alarm as to what this would mean. Aside from the abridgment of home rule, a requirement to accept dense development would probably bring new costs (the introduction of water and sewer systems, school expansion), which would be unlikely to be offset by property tax collections on the new developments. Planning to use a vacant parcel for new softball fields, or preserve it as open space? Sorry, but using town property for purposes that town residents favor could put the supervisors in violation of the settlement. And while much was said about how it would make sense to provide housing options for teachers, cops, and other town workers, along with downsizing retirees and others with local ties, the fact is that towns enter a legal minefield when they attempt to earmark low-income housing for those constituent groups. &#8220;Fair housing&#8221; litigants have repeatedly sued and sometimes won on the theory that such policies are unfair to other poorer people who might want to give the suburbs a try. And indeed, the settlement &#8220;requires the county to market the homes aggressively to black and Hispanic residents of the New York City area&#8221;  &mdash;  not just those already working or living in the county.</p>
<p>One question in many voters&rsquo; minds was whether incumbent county executive Spano, a Democrat, had in fact fought hard against going along, or had caved too readily to what both sides agreed were unprecedented demands (including $10 million for the plaintiffs and their lawyers). {snip} Spano replied by playing the race card: he said continued delay in approving the settlement would &#8220;make us a symbol of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happens, a lot of Westchesterites  &mdash;  residents of a county known for racial liberalism from way back, and which voted for Barack Obama by a comfortable margin  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t like being talked to that way. Now Spano, despite a well-financed campaign whose online ads were nearly as ubiquitous as Michael Bloomberg&rsquo;s, and all the advantages of incumbency and union backing, is packing for his departure. {snip}<br>

		<p>Mr. Astorino has a show on Sirius XM Radio&rsquo;s Catholic Channel, where he regularly interviews high up Catholic Bishops and Archbishops.  What I am surprised about is that I&rsquo;m sure the Church in NYC supports these housing programs, so one of their own important laypeople won an election by advocating the opposite.</p>
<p>This should be a blueprint for the Republican Party.  Race comes first   &mdash;   if you push race, you can turn a lot of blue places red, a lot of light red places dark red, and a lot of dark red places so red they might as well be burning.</p>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton bought a house in Westchester County about a year or so before they left office, I think the town was Chappaqua.  The running joke was to call it Disgraceland.  I don&rsquo;t know if either Bill or Hillary uses the house anymore; it was nothing more than HRC&rsquo;s beachhead to get elected to the Senate.  Bill IIRC lives in Harlem, close to his post-Presidency office.</p>

<p>So, we find out that liberals are racists when it comes to income.  They welcome affluent minority people into their &#8216;hoods, but not poor minorities.  The liberals need to be ashamed of themselves.  It is time for them to experience &#8220;all&#8221; of the multicultural experience.  </p>

The socially liberal whites of Westchester County had it coming to them. </p>
<p>Their mindset: Lets all vote for Obama because it&rsquo;s the socially responsible thing to do and then we&rsquo;ll all go home to our affluent white suburbs which are so safe and our school systems so great, etc. </p>
<p>Except this time its blowing up in their faces and are now screaming NIBYISM (not in my back yard). This is classic northeast liberal hypocracy.<br>
 <br>
Everying is hunky- dory with white suburban liberals as long  &#8220;those people&#8221; are somwhere else. </p>
<p>Strict zoning regulations and outrageous property taxes weren&rsquo;t enough this time to ensure &#8220;physical seperation&#8221; and the crows will be coming home to roost.</p>
<p>These whites want to live in implied white communities, rich in money and social capital on one hand, yet sabotage themselves with their skewed racial thinking and voting with the other. </p>
<p>They wanted their piece of cake, but this time cannot eat it to.</p>
<p>They sold their souls to the devil to avoid this lawsuit and are now feeling the heat.</p>

		<p>	Multiculturalism has always been reserved for the lower classes; the politicians and special interests who promoted massive immigration don&rsquo;t really want move into dangerous cities so they continue hiding in gated communities. It&rsquo;s the poor whites who have historically been the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values.<br>

        Maybe it&rsquo;s time for white liberal everywhere to share in the multicultural dream of their own making. <br>

Mr Simms did enough damage here, but couldn&rsquo;t get himself elected governor, but is now the nations problem. Good luck America. </p>

To remove zip codes &ldquo;as a factor in the quality of life&rdquo; in a nation &mdash; so that 10455 (South Bronx), 91731 (El Monte, California), and 48210 (Detroit&rsquo;s west side) have exactly the same implications for quality of life as 10021 (New York&rsquo;s Upper East Side), 90210 (Beverly Hills), and 48009 (Birmingham, Michigan) &mdash; would require extreme, indeed utopian, ventures into social engineering.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is on AR reader who would be thrilled if the nice white denizens of Beverly Hills, the Upper East Side and Grosse Point got a taste of what they push on the rednecks and grits in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Ironically, I was thinking just this last weekend. I was in the charming port town of Essex, Connecticut. It is truly a quaint and historic little town and I saw exactly one non-white (an Asian woman apparently married to a white man).</p>
<p>But the nice whites I saw about Essex were the epitome of &#8220;Stuff White People Like&#8221; types. These are the same whites I saw in Oprah&rsquo;s audience in the late 1980s when she had on white residents from a town in Georgia fighting against forced integration. They jeered, booed and hectored the Georgia rednecks who were simply trying to avoid the robberies, rapes and murders that blacks always bring with them. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the nice white residents of Essex - smiling, polite and friendly to a man - all voted for Obama. I laugehd to myself as I imagined thier expressions and internal reactions if it was announced that section 8 housing would be built in Essex by 2011.</p>

		<p>Oh, this really is too much, really rich!  All the wealthy limousine liberals of West Chester County are now squealing like stuck pigs at the thought of project housing being located in their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>But what an opportunity this affords them, to demonstrate that they understand the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of black crime and how these previously intractable root causes can be corrected by an enlightened upper class white citizenry, who will now be able to mingle freely with their new underclass neighbors and teach them first-hand the benefits of emulating their betters.  Surely these West Chester sophisticates can see this priceless opportunity fairly begging to be grasped.</p>
<p>How I envy them!  Were it not for the state and property taxes in the New York suburbs I&rsquo;d happily move up there to partake in this great social experiment.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?  You say it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get a carry permit in New York?  Umm, never mind. </p>

		<p>Hahahahaha, if there is anything I despise more than a black thug, its got to be a self-righteous,limosine liberal. Now its time for them to practice what they preach.</p>
<p>Now they can get healthy helpings of multi-cultural diversity they have been espousing. I&rsquo;m sure they will enjoy the &#8220;vibrant African-American culture&#8221;, and all it brings.</p>
<p>The very best part is there will not be one iota of increase in crime. For example: there will be no robbery, instead it will be involuntary wealth redistribution, no rape, instead it will be classified as forced sexual integration, no murder, instead it we will classify it as lethal post-slavery reperations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but the thought of a hard core limosine liberal being assaulted on any level by blacks is highly satisfying and entertaining. I really pull my punches on these posts,I have alot of bile stored up when it comes to liberals. Mr. Taylor I grudgingly give thanks for you forcing me to hold myself to a higher standard when it comes to my postings on this site.</p>

		<p>To be honest, this is not all that surprising. I am a 57 year old conservative White male. </p>
<p>The fact is that the autoher is correct. These sorts of Whites have always welcomed Blacks doctors, lawyers, professors, public relations, businessmen and similar other Black and Hispanic people in their neighborhoods. - the Huxtable/Cosby Show types so to speak.</p>
<p>They like to give lip service to being concerned about poor and lower income people, but they will run like hell from them - White, Black, Hispanic etc&hellip; if they feel these people are getting too close to them.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy is astounding.<br>

		<p>Just deserts for the &#8220;Diversity is only for the poor Whites&#8221; crowd.  They should have seen this comming but generations of equality propaganda take their toll on one&rsquo;s understanding of cause and effect.</p>
<p>Short sighted thinking is the primary undoing of the non-White races and all too many White people as well.  </p>
<p>The more the rich class has to interact with the diversity it either imports or praises, the less they will be able to deny racial inequality.</p>

		<p>I love the idea of &#8220;integrating&#8221; lower income minorities into wealthy, liberal, white neighborhoods.  Now the residents of Westchester, NY, of whom so many had vocally or tacitly supported a pro-diversity plank for the rest of the country, can enjoy the economic, social, and cultural benefits of a &#8220;diversity&#8221; right in their own backyard.  I mean, what&rsquo;s there to fear from a little hip-hop music or breakdancing?  Lighten up people!  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just a skin color.          </p>

<p>&#8220;Fleeing From South Africa<br>
Fourteen years after apartheid, why are the best and the brightest leaving Africa&rsquo;s most successful state?<br>
&hellip;<br>
according to a report by the South African Institute on Race Relations. Some 800,000 out of a total white population of 4 million have left since 1995, by one count.<br>
&hellip;<br>
The primary driver for emigration among all groups, but especially whites, who still retain the majority of South Africa&rsquo;s wealth, is fear of crime. With more than 50 killings a day, South Africa has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. The same goes for rape &mdash; ranking the country alongside conflict zones such as Sierra Leone, Colombia and Afghanistan.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Another largely unnoticed problem is the growing number of attacks on South Africa&rsquo;s white farmers. As in neighboring Zimbabwe, some of the attacks appear to be racially motivated. Others seem simply opportunistic, but the result is that white farmers&rsquo; numbers continue to decrease, leading to fears that despite the government&rsquo;s good intentions, a Zimbabwe-style crisis &mdash; where the flight of skilled farmers led to an agricultural collapse &mdash; is possible here too.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the problem of affirmative action, which many whites feel limits their opportunities for advancement and which keeps many émigrés from returning. &#8220;You can attract people home, but there are still the same concerns when they get here,&#8221; Chen says. &#8220;Crime and lack of job opportunities if you&rsquo;re not the right color.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting twist to this story, in which people here should be made aware of. I live in a small city here in northern westchester county, about forty minutes south of Chappaqua, where of course the Clintons own a home. There has been a desparate attempt to revitilize this once beautiful city by creating a artist movement here, by bring &#8220;so called&#8221; artist up from New York City and parts of Westchester. These artist were enticed here by the various &#8220;not for profit&#8221; programs promised by the city and as a result, a number of them now have art galaries here and a number of them have taken up residence, forming a click among themselves. </p>
<p>Anyway, right down the street from where i grew up and live, a group of people-ironically from Chappaqua-have set up a art studio in a huge building a few years ago. Here&rsquo;s the twist. When this group announced, at a common council meeting, which was locally televised, that they intended to set up shop here, one of the reasons why this small city appealed to them (which is a mixture of black, hispanic and white,) was the &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>Now i know for a fact the main reason why they are here, is because of the various government programs and grants available to them. This building sits in the middle of a mostly black and hispanic neighborhood (yes, i am now a minority in it,) and is fenced in by high wrought iron gated fence, with a parking lot. There are always expensive cars sitting in the lot, and these people keep a low profile whenever they are there-never seen intermingling with the diverse people they had claimed they liked so much. </p>

Now even if the hub makes a killing in the city Ms.liberated soccer mom will have to dodge the recepients of taxpayer funded largesse at the strip mall. On the other hand this could be a minor stimulus as alarm systems, gates, lighting and panic rooms will become the order of the day. The thought of those santomonious S.O.B.s buying guns to defend themselves is just too much.</p>

		<p>Yes, &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; has always been class warfare by another name.  Liberalism is a mental illness comprised mostly of an all consuming desire to be recognized as special and superior to the masses, particularly the middle class.   This is the driving force of white liberal support for clearly destructive racial policies; indeed the more destructive these policies are the purer their &#8220;idealism&#8221; is and the greater their sainthood, although unlike saints of the past they prefer someone else take the flagellation and sacrifice.  Attacking the psychology of Liberalism and eroding their claims to moral superiority by laying at their feet the deserved responsibility for the mass wave of anti-white violence since the 1960s would be a powerful weapon against them,  but it&rsquo;s something the Conservative establishment and Republicans will never do.   </p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the numbers involved in this settlement are minuscule and could be absorbed easily by this county, they don&rsquo;t give the Liberals of Westchester anywhere near a &#8220;dose&#8221; enough to be therapeutic.   And in any case most Liberals will never learn from contact with non-white predators,  they&rsquo;ll just move away.   Contrary to Conservative mythology, 98% of mugged or raped Liberals won&rsquo;t change their tune,  their attachment to Liberal racial beliefs is a deeply entrenched  psychological need/religion that defines their very existence, it would entail an ego death far more painful than injury suffered during a personal racial attack.   </p>

They can learn such real life skills as how to recover from a gang beating or gang rape.
