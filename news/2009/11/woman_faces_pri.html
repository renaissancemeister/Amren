<h1>Woman Faces Prison Time After Cutting in Line at Walmart</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jackie McPherson, WLMT-TV (Memphis), November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A big Bluff City rally for Heather Ellis. She&rsquo;s the Missouri woman facing 15 years in prison for cutting in line at Walmart.</p>
<p>Ellis is charged with assaulting an officer, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. She claims she did nothing wrong and that she is actually the victim in this case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ellis goes on trial this week in Kennett, Missouri  &mdash;  about a two hour drive north of Memphis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Heather cut in line, and then when called out for it, she caused a major disturbance at the store.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Ellis says that&rsquo;s not true, and that his daughter was the one called racial slurs by a store clerk and officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just indict her and launch an all-out attack to destroy her character and assassinate her future&#8221; says Ellis. &#8220;This is her choice, not to admit fault in an area where she hasn&rsquo;t done anything and so we&rsquo;re standing by her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hundreds of others are also standing by Heather.</p>
<p>On the social networking site Facebook, there are groups in support of her, and on Monday November 16th a rally is planned outside the Kennett Walmart.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ellis&rsquo; family says they have been threatened by the Ku Klux Klan since speaking publicly about Heather&rsquo;s case. They&rsquo;ve asked the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved.<br>

								<h2>Arrest at Walmart Leads to Charges of Racism</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Betsy Taylor, WLMT-TV (Memphis), November 16, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witnesses have told authorities that Ellis cut in front of waiting customers at the Walmart in Kennett on Jan. 6, 2007, shoved merchandise already placed on a conveyor belt out of the way, and became belligerent when confronted, according to court filings.</p>
<p>Ellis maintains she was merely joining her cousin, whose checkout line was moving more quickly. She claimed in a written complaint to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that she was then pushed by a white customer, hassled by store employees, called racial slurs and physically mistreated by Kennett police officers.</p>
<p>Police say in court documents that Ellis refused requests to calm down and leave the property, allegedly kicking one&rsquo;s shin and splitting another&rsquo;s lip while resisting arrest. Her trial on charges of assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace begins Wednesday in Dunklin County Circuit Court. Syracuse, N.Y.-based Your Black World Coalition is organizing a Monday rally in Kennett.</p>
<p>A college student in New Orleans at the time of her arrest, the 24-year-old Ellis now teaches in Louisiana, where she is engaged to a state trooper. She has said she feels trapped by &#8220;small-town politics&#8221; in Kennett, where her family lives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group subsequently held a rally in Kennett. Before the June 13 event began, police officers found threatening letters the size of business cards scattered along the route that said the Ku Klux Klan had paid a visit and &#8220;the next visit will not be social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunklin County Prosecutor Stephen Sokoloff said the cards were removed and the source investigated but never discovered. He said he doubts the cards actually were from the KKK; he knows of no KKK presence in the area. A call to the KKK headquarters was not answered.</p>
<p>As for Ellis&rsquo; allegations of mistreatment by law enforcement, Sokoloff said he&rsquo;s &#8220;seen absolutely no evidence of any kind, apart from her statements, that those things occurred.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ellis&rsquo; written account to the NAACP describes she [sic] and her cousin getting into separate checkout lanes before Ellis switched into the faster-moving line. The woman behind them had placed items on the conveyor belt, and Ellis alleged the woman pushed her when she tried to put her own items down.</p>
<p>Witnesses instead told police that Ellis shoved the woman&rsquo;s merchandise back, according to court filings.</p>
<p>Ellis wrote that a security officer and manager were called over and that although Ellis said she wanted to pay, the manager yelled at her to leave the store. Police were called and arrived.</p>
<p>Officers eventually followed her to the parking lot, she said, using racial slurs and telling her to go back to the ghetto. As her aunt and uncle drove into the parking lot, Ellis said, the officers &#8220;jumped&#8221; on her even though she said she was not resisting.</p>
<p>Officer A.W. Fisher wrote in a probable cause statement that Ellis was given &#8220;every opportunity&#8221; to comply with officers and leave the property. He said she used an expletive in telling him she would beat him if he put his hands on her.</p>
<p>Fisher said he then told Ellis she was under arrest, but she would not stop fighting while being handcuffed.</p>
<p>Following her arrest, Ellis alleged, she was thrown against doors on the way into jail and an officer later twisted her shirt with his knuckle to choke her while she was in custody.</p>

		<p>I think everyone who has had any amount of contact with blacks is thinking the same thing (no matter how liberal they are): this entitled, attitudinal woman did exactly what she is accused of, as do millions of other entitled, attitudinal blacks every single day.  Shoving in line, cutting people off in traffic, expecting everyone else to give them priority passage in life.</p>
<p>I work in DC, and in the past month alone there have been at least seven stories like this I could tell.  Do they really wonder why no other race wants to be around them?</p>

		<p>There is no doubt a recording of the incident.  That would certainly show how everyone acted.  However, if she can convince the jury that she was called a racial slur AFTER CUTTING in line no matter what she did, even asaulting a policeman, she will get off.  Then she sues Walmart and wins the ghetto lottery.  Sweet.</p>

		<p>I see this kind of behavior on a daily basis.There is nothing unusual to see a black woman shove her way into line, and then sweep the White man or White woman&rsquo;s purchases off the belt to make room for her own. That a temper tantrum resulted when called on this does not surprise me, either.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not about facing 15 years in prison for cutting in line at Walmart.<br>
She also became belligerent.<br>
Also: &#8220;The woman behind them had placed items on the conveyor belt, and Ellis alleged the woman pushed her when she tried to put her own items down.<br>
Witnesses instead told police that Ellis shoved the woman&rsquo;s merchandise back, according to court filings.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the headline is deliberately misleading and is put there to incite some people to make a racist thing out of it.</p>
<p>We all know the &#8220;racial slurs&#8221; are nothing more than the way for the woman to get away with her crime.</p>

		<p>I love these stories and really applaud the liberal press for constantly printing this kind of story on a regular basis.  As we all know when blacks act in this  manner they are almost invariably outed, usually sooner than later.  Resulting of course in whites who were favorably disposed towards blacks finally concluding that most blacks are generally whiners, disengenuous and perpetually playing the race card. This mass media education of the public is certainly not the intended purpose, which is of course  to sell the public on how racist whites are, although it in fact has the opposite result. A half dozen of these cases a year if continually played up by liberals could do more than any legal action to end reverse discrimination.  Unfortunately it appears the NAACP may be figuring this out since it wouldn&rsquo;t get involved here.  But don&rsquo;t dispair the Reverend Al is far to stupid to think that clearly.</p>

<p>I have witnessed cops giving a belligerent black every opportunity in the world to peacefully leave a situation that a white would be facing charges for and the black refusing and in fact continue getting more and more confrontational. </p>
<p>And once blacks are arrested in these incdents they tend to try and play themselves off as victims and make up some wild story where they were innocent, cooperative bystanders who were assaulted for no reason. I have personally witnessed two seperate incidents where this has occured and read countless similar examples. It must be a black thing, because I sure dont get it.</p>

		<p>Whenever I happen to be casually engaged in a conversation with a non racially-aware White person about race, I always bring up the subject of the universal less-than-civilized behavior of blacks.</p>
<p>My favorite tac is that I ask them to recall their own day to day experiences with black people.  Inevitably, I ask them about their experiences in, say, supermarkets.  </p>
<p>To a person they will readily admit that blacks will routinely pass in front of them and fail to say &#8220;excuse me.&#8221;  They will recognize that blacks think nothing about reaching their hand right in front of your face, also sans apology.  They (blacks) often cast off their shopping carts in the parking lot any which way they please.</p>
<p>And cutting in line?  Well, apparently to blacks only fools act civilized and politely wait their rightful turn in line.</p>
<p>So when I read the account of this incident, I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this woman &#8220;went black&#8221; on everybody at the store and indeed did what she&rsquo;s accused of doing.</p>

		<p>Even if it comes out that the whole incident was captured on store video cameras, and the evidence clearly shows this woman to be a liar, the cries of racism are not likely to diminish.</p>
<p>Strange how some people are so self-centered that just because a friend or relative is in another line, that gives them license to join up with them and cut in front of others who are properly waiting their turns.</p>

		<p> The usual agitators and the liberal news media have jumped onto this case with both feet, but I&rsquo;ll go with the statements of the witnesses and the police.</p>
<p> A similar incident happened in my hometown, where a black woman caused a disturbance in a Wal-Mart store, walked out with merchandise she hadn&rsquo;t paid for, and slugged a store manager who followed her into the parking lot, after which she was finally arrested. They look for chances to play the victim and yell &#8220;Racism!&#8221; I know the woman in my town did.</p>

		<p>When Blacks get into any sort of trouble, they generally claim it&rsquo;s because of &#8220;racism&#8221;. Like they have it in their small minds that White people are supposed to recoil like a vampire from a crucifix at that word.</p>

		<p>This is such typical behavior  &mdash;  almost stereotypical  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s hard to believe it didn&rsquo;t happen exactly as everyone but the &#8220;victim&#8221; describes. One can just picture the obese body, the bobbing head, the foul-mouthed belligerant attitude. It happens every day, in enough other places all around this vast land, that I have no problem simply locking her up without a lot of fanfare. It might have some small effect on the thousands of others like her.</p>

		<p>Blacks are notorious line jumpers.  I had an experience - also at a Walmart - where I got on a line where one white woman was checking out ahead of me.  There was a black woman at the checkout next to us talking to this white woman ahead of me.  When the white woman left, the black woman sauntered over in front of me.  I firmly - but civilly - confronted her.  She said she had been on line and went over to the other register to grab something.  I told her she needed to let people know because it looked to me like she was cutting in front of me.  She was pretty amicable.  During our going back and forth, a young black man (from the black underclass) stood behind this black woman and just watched us.  He left when we sorted it out (it was apparent that they did not know each other).  I knew right away what the message was.  This white woman was on her own and she better leave the sister alone.  Not one white man - or woman - would ever do that for me or any fellow white.  Never!  I learned my lesson a long time ago that I will have to defend myself and my own - ALONE.  I now pack for me, and me alone, just in case.<br>

		<p>The media, including the writer of this article, is trying to trivialize this case by saying that she was under arrest for cutting in line. She was under arrest for assault, disturbing the peace, and attacking an officer. Even though the cases are very different, it&rsquo;s much like the Knoxville horror being called a &#8220;carjacking&#8221; why is the media so afraid to say what blacks are being accused of? Naturally the answer is that there can be no excuse for such behavior and the only thing that can be done is to play it down. <br>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t too far from me.  And I think she&rsquo;s playing the ghetto lottery.  No white cop, Kennett, MO, or anywhere else, would be dumb enough to utter a racial slur at a black woman.  She or her allies planted the K-group cards, is the most likely explanation.</p>

<p>Sad isnt it?  The Media asks in similar situations, &#8216;Why didnt anyone help?&rsquo; Like the Pizza line assault back in 04. https://www.newsnet5.com/news/4215140/detail.html</p>

		<p>At one time, I worked at a company that bussed all of the workers to the specific areas where we worked. Blacks continually and invariably cut in line, specifically in front of whites who they knew would say nothing. I watched this every single day! </p>
<p>Often times I would see older workers that had been working all day, standing in the inhospitable weather for forty-five minutes waiting on a bus, only to have a young black, or group of them step in front of them. The blacks would always pretend as if nothing at all had just happened and the whites too scared to say anything - most of the time. </p>
<p>Their fear was driven by their instincts: they knew what the potential consequences would be when confronting a black about their misbehavior - more misbehavior. Whites understand their propensity for spontaneous and unprovoked violence. So, as I witnessed daily, white victims typically say nothing. If they do say anything, they will deal with the type of behavior Ms. Ellis demonstrated. </p>
<p>Blacks are not the only humans equipped with instincts. Us whites have them too. Instincts are extremely useful when around blacks. They are very instinctual. </p>
<p>I also noticed blacks constantly asking workers for cigarettes. It did not matter who it was, as long as they were white. They would walk up to complete strangers and ask for cigarettes, from daylight to dark. I never, not one time saw a white do that.         </p>

		<p>Blacks butt in line all the time; at the shopping mall, checkout counter, at the bank, etc. They also do the same thing with their cars too. Its partly out of their deeply ingrained (false) sense of entitlement. Its also partly a form of passive (and not do pasive) racial aggression against Whites.</p>

		<p>Speaking of black women cutting in line, check out <a>this&#8221;&gt;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1147&gt;this</a> episode of This American Life.  The journalist in the last story raves about how refreshing it is that the French don&rsquo;t put up with her and her boyfriend&rsquo;s attempt to cut to front of the line at a movie theater.  See, the fact we Americans routinely let her get away with this nonsense proves how racist and evil we are.  She&rsquo;s obviously intelligent, well-educated, and yes, articulate, but she sees nothing at wrong with her boorish, uncivilized, and ridiculously entitled behavior, and instead uses it as an occasion to revile <i>us!</i>  It&rsquo;s almost unbelievable that she would brag about this on national radio and that NPR would let the story air.</p>
<p>More proof that appeasement and weakness win us no friends, as if more was needed.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just blacks.  Pushing and shoving and cutting in line are extremely common among Latins too. It&rsquo;s the custom!  I have encountered this many times in Latin countries, or wherever Latins are found.  They have no regard for orderly behavior and will try to get away with whatever they can. You have to make it very clear that you&rsquo;re not prepared to tolerate it, otherwise they  will walk all over you.</p>

		<p>I witnessed the same behavior where there were family members holding places in several lines at the local Shop-Rite food store.  Even more galling was the line where the line-cutter entered was the express line for 10 or less items.  The belligerent not only cut in line but had nearly three time the 10 item limit.  When confronted, out came the the indigent social entitlement behavior of I have my place holder and I am only a few items over the limit.  Then when an item didn&rsquo;t qualify for the coupon, they further held up the line by calling in the manager to plead (unsuccessfully) the case.  Turns out the line cutter was a employee of our local consumer protection agency!  </p>
