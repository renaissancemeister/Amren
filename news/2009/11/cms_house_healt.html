			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly K. Hooper, The Hill, November 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House-approved healthcare overhaul would raise the costs of healthcare by $289 billion over the next 10 years, according to an analysis by the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the CMS analysis clearly states that the House bill falls short in attaining a key goal of the Democrats&rsquo; effort to reform the nation&rsquo;s healthcare system: &#8220;With the exception of the proposed reduction in Medicare .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the provisions of H.R. 3962 would not have a significant impact on future healthcare cost growth rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brendan Daly, communications director for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said, &#8220;The report shows that our health reform bill will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by five years  &mdash;  significantly longer than any proposal in recent years,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Medicare actuaries estimate $100 billion more in savings than CBO from Medicaid and Medicare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) highlighted the CMS report on Saturday in a written statement. &#8220;This report once again discredits Democrats&rsquo; assertions that their $1.3 trillion government takeover of health care will lower costs, and it confirms that this bill violates President Obama&rsquo;s promise to &#8216;bend the cost curve.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s now beyond dispute that their bill will raise costs, which is exactly what the American people don&rsquo;t want.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the 31-page report, the House-passed bill would increase costs, cut Medicare and expand Medicaid.</p>
<p>&#8220;In aggregate, we estimate that for calendar years 2010 through 2019 [national health expenditures] would increase by $289 billion,&#8221; the report notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;About three-fifths&#8221; or more than 60 percent of the uninsured would gain coverage by an expansion in Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>Medicare would be cut by &#8220;more than one-half trillion dollars ($571 billion), .&nbsp;.&nbps;. possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries,&#8221; according to the report, and smaller companies would be &#8220;inclined to terminate their existing coverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview with The Hill on Saturday afternoon, Camp [Ways and Means Committee ranking member Dave Camp (R-Mich.)] pointed out that CMS actuarial numbers were cited by Democrats back in 2003 during the Medicare prescription drug debate. CMS estimated at that time that the GOP-crafted Medicare bill would cost more than $550 billion over 10 years while CBO estimated its pricetag at $395 over the same period. The CMS cost estimate did not emerge until after the final conference bill was approved by Congress.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely inconceivable to me that the people in this country are going to allow that bunch in Congress to replace our healthcare system with one that requires everyone to purchase a health insurance policy or be fined and/or go to jail.</p>
<p>It amounts to replacing a workable system that needs fine-tuning with one that is going to surely cost more and be far worse than what we have now, from the very beginning.</p>
<p>This unsustainable empire is cracking badly and will soon disolve.</p>

		<p>This must surely go down as one of the biggest canards foisted upon the American people since the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement! &#8220;It&rsquo;s going add this much cost&hellip;but going to eliminate that much cost!&#8221; &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to reduce Medicare&hellip;but it&rsquo;s going to bring more money to Medicare.&#8221; &#8220;No illegal Americans will be covered&#8221; &#8220;This won&rsquo;t add a dime to the debt&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole thing is laughably disingenuous to the core. No living soul has any real idea what any of this nonsense will cost, how it will work - if it will work, who it would work for, what it means to existing policies, what it will cost individuals, etc.</p>
<p>Exactly who is this supposed to be helping again?</p>

		<p>And yet we have many elderly and naive and dumbed down Americans who support this travesty!  WHO are these people anyway? If this is who they call &#8220;Americans&#8221; I think we are too far gone to ever bring our country back from the insanity that has infected over half the population.  As for the elderly, they pay too much attention to the AARP, which is nothing but a bunch of liberal nutcases who support this kind of anti-Americanism. </p>

		<p>If the plan is going to give the free-loaders Medicaid then what is the point? Don&rsquo;t they alread have that? The real reason for this is to take what little whites have left and &#8216;spread the wealth&rsquo;. The less money people have the meeker they become when it comes to standing against the flow of congress. If you didn&rsquo;t read Chapter 31: The Gulag that was posted here a few weeks back, you should take the time.</p>

<p>I remember the same promises made about Medicare.  Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965.  After 44 years to get it right they are broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Exactly who is this supposed to be helping again?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not about health care  &mdash;  it is about transferring more money and power to an increasingly authoritarian central government.</p>
<p>The politicians should be endlessly slammed and questioned about why THEY and their loved ones have a separate, better health care system  &mdash;  something the msm refuse to do.</p>
<p>For you and your loved ones?   Go home and take a Soma.</p>
