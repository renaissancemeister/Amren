			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Sims, Daily Mail (London), November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a horribly familiar situation for many of us: no sooner is it payday than various bills and shopping trips mean we&rsquo;re right back where we started.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d expect it to be a different story for a Premier League footballer earning £75,000 a week.</p>
<p>Not, however, in the case of former Newcastle United striker Obafemi Martins, who was often broke, according to claims about the star&rsquo;s prodigious spending habits in a court case yesterday.</p>
<p>The revelations marked the start of a bitter legal battle between the player and his former management company, as it was claimed that he regularly withdrew £40,000 at weekends and a further £25,000 the following Monday.</p>
<p>Nigeria international player Martins, 25, joined Newcastle for a £10million fee in August 2006.</p>
<p>NVA Management insists it managed every aspect of its former client&rsquo;s life and was often forced to bail him out after his bank account slipped into the red.</p>
<p>The firm is now suing the footballer for £300,000 it claims he still owes them for sorting out his financial affairs.</p>
<p>Robert Tennink, the lawyer representing NVA, told the High Court in London: &#8216;Despite earning these vast sums of money he was constantly overdrawn.&rsquo; He said Martins had come to the firm, which looks after the affairs of several footballers, film and music stars, in July 2007.</p>
<p>In return for managing his life, he would pay a one-off fee of £300,000, and give NVA 20 per cent of any sponsorship monies they acquired on his behalf.</p>
<p>Mr Tennink said it was under NVA&rsquo;s stewardship that the striker agreed a £2million image rights deal &#8216;simply for being Mr Martins&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The star also had lucrative sponsorship deals with various companies including Pepsi and Nike but had not been paid for these until NVA stepped in to get the contracts honoured, bringing in thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Before they managed his affairs Martins had not been paid a penny for his image rights on Newcastle United shirts and mugs. He had received nothing from his sponsorship deals and could not even find the contracts he had originally signed.</p>
<p>NVA said it also organised travel visas, a passport, his mortgage and property valuations, and was constantly going up to Newcastle from its London offices for him.</p>
<p>Mr Tennink told Judge Richard Seymour, QC: &#8216;Day to day life with superstars is demanding and superstars are demanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Martins, who owned several fast cars including a top-of-the-range £85,000 Porsche Cayenne 4x4, spent the money on a lifestyle of luxurious penthouse homes and fine dining.</p>
<p>He owned a large multimillion pound home in the exclusive footballers&rsquo; enclave of Darras Hall, near Ponteland, Northumbria, and rented an opulent flat overlooking Newcastle upon Tyne&rsquo;s trendy Quayside.</p>
<p>The striker, who was sold for £9million to German side Wolfsburg after Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League earlier this year, paid NVA £67,500 in January last year and another £25,000 in April last year but NVA claims it is still owed over £300,000.</p>
<p>Martins, who was not in court yesterday, is fighting the claim and the hearing is scheduled to last for three days.</p>

		<p>When stories like this come up, the official excuse seems to be that people that young just can&rsquo;t handle a lot of money dumped on them all at once. </p>
<p>Strangely enough, many white young professional athletes who have a lot of money dumped on them while they are young have no trouble saving up for the years after their retirement.  So it&rsquo;s not age, it&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>The same establishment that orders us not to be racial bigots has no problem with age bigotry.</p>

		<p>The majority of soccer players in the Premier League are black and most of them are married to white women.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago there no black players at all, it seems that soon there will be only black players.</p>
<p>England and France have the most black players close to 80%, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and even Italy where there were no black players are getting more and more.</p>
<p>Almost all French national team is black.</p>
<p>These are signs of what is to come, a black Europe.<br>

		<p>But who&rsquo;s the more foolish? The player squandering the paycheck or the fans spending good money on the pointless distraction known as as professional sport? Why root for transient, mercenary players? Why pledge allegiance to a mere rich mans possession? </p>
<p>How dimly glows the bulb in the average fans noggin. </p>
<p>Item; The Detroit Lions homeplace, The Pontiac Silverdome, a stadium funded by the taxpayer just sold for $500,000. That&rsquo;s a loss of 99.75% of the original taxpayers investment of $220,000,000 (corrected for inflation). Ahhh, the joys of government directed real-estate investments.  </p>

		<p>Athletics and entertainment. That&rsquo;s all blacks have. All they will ever have. Successful financial planning requires long-term planning and the ability to delay gratification. Neither is a characteristic of blacks. </p>

		<p>I cannot believe our stupidity in that we spend so much of our hard earned money on people like him. Professional sports have become a sham and just like big business and the MSM it has no concern for our nation, race and civilization. Today Manchester United has little to do with Manchester and more to do with Accra or Lagos. Professional sports today are a big rip-off, a big business where a brand is sold to foolish proles. When we buy an overpriced (made in Bangladesh or China) Manchester United or a Liverpool football club T-shirt, we are paying them to get more foreigners to come to our nations. Same with the N.B.A or other sports.</p>

<i>Why root for transient, mercenary players?</i></p>
<p>When I was really young, I remember being taken back to learn that the men who played on sports teams (such as the Buffalo Bills) weren&rsquo;t from Buffalo. I didn&rsquo;t understand how they could play (or fight) for a city that wasn&rsquo;t their home. Pretty much the definition of a mercenary.</p>
<p>I was told that if only locals were allowed to play for a team, larger cities would have a greater advantage.</p>
<p>The explanation made sense but my original gut feeling still tells me this is wrong at least in some small way.</p>
<p>Wars used to be fought by common men of a common nation for a common self-interest. Sports have become a metaphor for multi-CULTuralism.  </p>
<p>These articles of black players and black rappers and black clothes designers have become passé.</p>
<p>Too many blacks can&rsquo;t understand that money is a tool, not an end.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m getting a Zenit (St. Petersburg, Russia) shirt, and why I&rsquo;m a fan of the team. At the supporters&rsquo; insistence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_St._Petersburg#Current_squad" rel="nofollow">there are <i>zero</i> blacks</a> on the roster. (Note: AR ran <a href="/news/2008/05/were_not_racist.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> concerning Zenit about 18 months ago.)</p>
<p>At any rate, Newcastle was relegated out of the Premiership after last season, so perhaps some poetic justice was served.</p>
