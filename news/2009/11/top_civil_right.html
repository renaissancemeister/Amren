<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-civil-rights31-2009oct31,0,717537.story">Top Civil Rights Attorney Promises Increased Enforcement of Discrimination Laws</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, October 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s top civil rights attorney vowed Friday to step up enforcement of laws against housing bias, hate crimes, racially targeted predatory lending and other discriminatory acts in what he called a new era of &#8220;transformation and restoration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Perez, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights, also said during a keynote address to an Asian Pacific American civil rights conference in Los Angeles that he would &#8220;depoliticize decision-making&#8221; and work to restore trust between career attorneys and political appointees in the Justice Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez lauded the Bush administration&rsquo;s work on ensuring voter access to bilingual ballots, combating religious discrimination and cracking down on human trafficking.</p>
<p>But he said that too few cases were filed to challenge alleged discrimination in other areas, such as voting practices, voter registration procedures and what he called &#8220;toxic predatory lending&#8221; targeted at minority consumers.</p>
<p>Such lending, he said, helped exacerbate the foreclosure crisis as the federal government failed to use fair housing and equal credit laws to attack the practices.</p>
<p>In contrast, Perez said, the Obama administration planned to use all legal tools available to enforce all civil rights laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez said the Obama administration&rsquo;s renewed emphasis on civil rights enforcement was reflected in a 20% proposed budget increase that would allow his office to add more than 100 new staff members. {snip}</p>
<p>Perez, a 48-year-old Dominican American sworn into office two weeks ago, worked for 12 years as a civil rights attorney under both Republican and Democratic administrations. He most recently served as Maryland&rsquo;s labor secretary.</p>

		<p>WOW! Does this mean white people in Philadelphia will be allowed to vote?  Does this mean white woman will be protected from rape?  White men will be protected in the work place?</p>
<p>Dominican American: why do we need foreign born government employees?  Do you mean to tell me there are no Americans who want a secure government job?  Walk into a government office here in NJ and you will find lots of foreign born employees.  While white Americans are out of work.</p>

		<p>The Civil Rights Act was the beginning of the end for traditional White America. It was nothing but a pro-minority, pro-homosexual agenda and anti-White legislation.  Next was the Feminist Movement that has turned out disastrous for women AND men, especially White women/men. Our White children have truly suffered because of both those Acts. America is no longer America in the real sense of the word and most assuredly not the America that the Founders envisioned. </p>

		<p>The LAST thing So CA needs is more &#8220;enforcement&#8221; of &#8220;civil rights laws.&#8221;  WHOSE civil rights??  Blacks and Mexicans?  You can bet that&rsquo;s so, and it will be at the expense of the whites and Asians who bring in the business.  The current administration thinks it can legislate and enforce cultural bias; ha!  Never.  It hasn&rsquo;t been done in 60 years and it won&rsquo;t be done, ever.  If blacks and Mexicans want real civil rights, then let them change their behavior - those in the ghettos and barrios.  They&rsquo;re the ones who continue to whine, and they are the ones who need to change.  People who have worked their way OUT of ghettos and barrios have already changed and adopted decent values.  Nope, it&rsquo;s the lower classes who always drag down the higher classes; it&rsquo;s unfortunate but true.  I personally think the Marines would do the best job of changing these low-class fools.</p>

		<p>WHy not do away with anti-discrimination laws in general?  The government never had any business telling businesses who they have to hire and who they have to do business with.</p>

		<p>Okay, so how does Perez explain the racial disparities in crime rates and victimization? Aren&rsquo;t rape, assault, robbery, and murder violations of civil rights? What civil rights violations do they see out there? Who is being denied the right to vote? Who is being denied the right to free speech? To carry guns? Specifics please. </p>
<p>Or are those specifics, once spelled out, going to make people a little uncomfortable? </p>
