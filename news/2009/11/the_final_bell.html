<h1>The Final Bell Tolls for Huntingdon Valley Swim Club</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philadelphia Inquirer, November 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Space constraints kept my story in today&rsquo;s Daily News from including the entire e-mail that Valley Club president John Duesler sent to members this week, announcing the pending bankruptcy of the small, Huntingdon Valley swimming pool. So I&rsquo;ll paste in Duesler&rsquo;s letter, in full, right here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends and Families of The Valley Club, </p>
<p>&#8220;I am writing with a heavy heart to inform you that The Valley Club will be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;And while many will point towards our legal situation and negative media exposure this summer as the reason for this decision, the truth is that the club has struggled to stay out of the red for at least the last decade. Despite our most ambitious efforts and countless hours of dedication towards the club, we have been unable to grow our membership enough to sustain The Valley Club any longer. Indeed, we have not been profitable, for as long as I&rsquo;ve been with the club. And our current debt from this year&rsquo;s operation and legal fees now exceeds $100,000. </p>
<p> &#8220;Combining this business fact with our legal proceedings, the Board of Directors has solicited feedback from our bond-holders to see how we should proceed into the future. With nearly 400 letters mailed to our current bond-holders, and less than 50 returned, apathy was clearly the tone that won the day. </p>
<p>&#8220;Of those who were willing to respond to our request for guidance, the result was as follows .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sent out 384 letters to bondholders asking for guidance and financial support.</p>
<p>&#8220;41 responses total </p>
<p>&#8220;$1100 collected in total from bondholders we need over 200,000</p>
<p>&#8220;19 wanted to mount a defense and 10 of those said to sell or bankruptcy to do this</p>
<p>&#8220;22 wanted no defense and to either sell or bankruptcy. </p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, we have also emailed you, last year&rsquo;s members, and have understandably received a collective shrug of the shoulders .&nbsp;.&*nbsp;.nbsp;. we are all tired and beaten down and just sickened by how our club has been improperly portrayed. After speaking to many members, my sense is that mostly everyone wants to move on. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have, and continue to, work with the Lower Moreland township to see if there is anyway that they could help maintain the land as a resource for our community. That has yet to be determined, as the township, like so many local governments around the nation, are facing incredible fiscal challenges that do not leave much wiggle-room for pop-up opportunities, such as this. </p>
<p> &#8220;Upon a thorough review of all these factors over the course of the summer, as well as deep into this fall, the Board of Directors voted last week 5-1 to file for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>&#8220;Please know that this Board has done everything in its power to find a reasonable solution to, not just the declining memberships, but the legal remedies too. Yet, as with so many things that we face in life today, much of our challenges came down to a matter of money! Money! Money! While our club has great heart and character, money is a resource of which we have been perpetually short. </p>
<p> &#8220;We do wish all of you the best, and we look forward to seeing you again within our community of families and friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, thanks for all your dedication to the swim club that you&rsquo;ve shown over your tenure there. We are glad that you chose the club.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. John G. Duesler, Jr.<br>
&#8220;President, The Valley Club Board of Directors&#8221;</p>

		<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been six months since we all saw the &#8220;disadvantaged youth&#8221; urchin whining on national television, uttering the laughably vague, &#8220;I think I heard somebody say something racist.&#8221; Now the predictable has occurred, the club is having to declare bankruptcy. What a victory for the racially diverse, PC crowd. One less place for whites to gather with their own kind. </p>

		<p>Well the money problems have come to the light of day and now we can see why the Club blinked and signed the original contract with the Inner-City Swimmers (sic).</p>
<p>And the fact that membership has been so low for so long was probably due to their inability, in spite of being a private entity, to invite who they wanted to and disallow who they wanted to.  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a microcosm of our country these days?  Low morale, no community, no zest for life.  Along the lines of what Robert Putnam said, diversity cause people to withdraw.  Leaving your house has become one big headache these days.  13% of the population used to have a hard time of it, and the solution has been to make sure 100% of the population has a hard time.</p>
<p>Nobody has any steel in their spines anymore, who knew such a thing would improve your swimming&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently pursuing dual citizenship and I&rsquo;ll be out of here right after the mayhem starts.  No, I&rsquo;m not running&hellip;. I&rsquo;m jumping&hellip;. jumping ship that is.  The place isn&rsquo;t worth fighting for anymore.  Since I&rsquo;m not the captain, I won&rsquo;t be going down with this sinking, stinking hellhole of a once great nation.<br>

No surprise.  Not even news at all!  This was all predicted by posters right here on Amren.  What could have been any other possible outcome?</p>
<p>And as was mentioned back then, this is the guy (an enthusiastic Obama supporter and advocate of diversity)  who led the club down the primrose path in the first place.  Well, well!</p>

		<p>#5 Why other whites are reluctant to do that is a mystery to me unless it is just beyond their abilities or they&rsquo;re just too wimpish.</p>
<p>Its lack of back up, because whites arent sure their fellow whites would back them up ( either shrug their shoulders, or call them racist), like the blacks back up other blacks no matter the accusations, either vocally or by omission and silently agreeing if not saying anything. </p>
<p>#7 Isn&rsquo;t that a microcosm of our country these days? Low morale, no community, no zest for life. Along the lines of what Robert Putnam said, diversity cause people to withdraw.

<p><br>
Exactly! But then  the next logical thought would be, What happens when instead of not leaving your house to get involved in the &#8216;headache&rsquo; the &#8216;headache&rsquo; comes into your house?</p>

		<p>The South has been subject to &#8216;reconstruction&rsquo; since the end of the War of Northern Aggression.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the rest of the US to experience a &#8216;reconstruction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And remember, as you go through the process&hellip;this is exactly what the HOPE and CHANGE was all about!<br>

		<p>The problem is that they caved.  Compare this story with that of the police officer who arrested &#8220;Professor&#8221; Gates.  When liberals started calling him a racist and Obama said he acted stupid, he stood fast and refused to apologize and Obama&rsquo;s approval rating among whites fell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that most liberal blogs that are covering this are celebrating the fact that the club closed down.  It&rsquo;s sad that they (and mainstream conservatives) have turned everything into a zero sum game - if blacks can&rsquo;t have something, then whites can&rsquo;t either.</p>
