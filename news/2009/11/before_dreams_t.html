			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Cashill, American Thinker, November 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;This is the first president that actually writes his own books since Teddy Roosevelt and arguably the first to write them really well since Lincoln,&#8221; gushed Rocco Landesman, the new chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Landesman was referring, of course, to Barack Obama, specifically for Obama&rsquo;s presumed role as author of the acclaimed 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father.</p>
<p>As evidence mounts that Obama did not exactly write Dreams unassisted, Landesman gives us a good indication of how America&rsquo;s cultural honchos will react. For a century, in fact, they have been heaping uncritical praise on undeserving artists of a certain political stripe, especially minority artists. And for a century, they have been pulling the curtain shut behind their pet wizards when anyone questions their wizardry.</p>
<p>There is no better case study of a literary cover-up than that surrounding the publishing phenomenon known as Roots: The Saga of an American Family. The book, first published in 1976, generated extraordinary reviews and spectacular sales. The mini-series based on the book captured more viewers than any series before it. 130 million Americans watched the final episode alone. And its author, Alex Haley, won a special Pulitzer Prize for telling the true story of a black family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Working from little more than this and the names of Kizzy&rsquo;s descendants, Haley finds his way back to an old-time &#8220;griot,&#8221; who tells him the allegedly true story of his own ancestor, Kunta Kinte.</p>
<p>{snip} Only the &#8220;greed and treason&#8221; introduced by white slave traders keeps Kinte&rsquo;s land from realizing its potential as an African Eden.</p>
<p>At age seventeen, Kinte is snatched from his youthful idyll by the evil, club-bearing &#8220;toubobs,&#8221; or white people. When he finally regains his senses four days later, Kinte finds himself chained in the stinking hold of an ocean-going vessel, manned by ugly toubobs, all of them seemingly British or American. {snip}</p>
<p>Despite the book&rsquo;s easy-going tone, Haley is quietly laying out an indictment against the United States that is always loaded and often gratuitous. In Haley&rsquo;s tale, it is the whites who enter the forest and enslave the blacks, not Arab slave traders, not other blacks. Since Kinte is unconscious through the period of transaction, the reader has no picture of African participation in the slave market, nor of any Portuguese or Hispanic involvement in the slave trade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fraud is the means Haley uses to indulge his bias, and this he does in an extraordinarily reckless fashion. Unfortunately for Haley, at least one person in the cultural establishment was not about to give him a pass because of race or agenda.</p>
<p>Approaching seventy when Roots debuted, Harold Courlander was shocked to read it. Courlander, who himself was white, was well-recognized in the field of cultural anthropology since 1947 when he coauthored The Cow-Tail Switch and Other West African Stories. In 1967, he wrote a more conventional novel titled The African. He earned $14,000 for it. Less than ten years later, Haley flagrantly rewrote large sections of his book and made $2.6 million in hardcover royalties alone. {snip}</p>
<p>In 1978, Courlander sued Haley in a U.S. District Court for copyright infringement. {snip}</p>
<p>Haley&rsquo;s defense fell apart when, during discovery, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers found three quotes from The African among typed notes that he had neglected to destroy. The last thing Judge Ward wanted to do was to undermine a newly ascendant black hero. Midway through the trial, he counseled Haley and his attorneys that he would have to contemplate a perjury charge unless they settled with Courlander. They did just that to the tune of $650,000, or more than $2 million by 2009 standards.</p>
<p>The settlement got precious little media attention. {snip} Like the other media who bothered to report on the settlement, the Post neglected to explore the real gist of the scandal: namely that the author of a &#8220;nonfiction&#8221; Pulitzer Prize-winning book plagiarized from a fictional one.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, unaware of the plagiarism rap, two leading genealogists, Gary Mills and Elizabeth Shown Mills, decided to follow up on Haley&rsquo;s work through the relevant archives in Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland. They found that Haley&rsquo;s transgressions went well beyond mere mistakes. &#8220;We expected ineptitude, but not subterfuge,&#8221; observed Elizabeth, herself the editor of the National Genealogical Society Quarterly.</p>
<p>In fact, as the Millses discovered, the man that Haley identifies as Kunta Kinte, a slave by the name of Toby, could not have been Kunta Kinte or Haley&rsquo;s ancestor. {snip}</p>
<p>In 1993, a year after Haley&rsquo;s death, writer Philip Nobile did his best to expose what he calls &#8220;one of the great literary hoaxes of modern times.&#8221; In February of that year, he published &#8220;Uncovering Roots&#8221; in the influential alternative publication, The Village Voice. The article brought to a larger public the story of the Courlander suit and the Mills&rsquo;s genealogy work.  Nobile also revealed that Haley&rsquo;s editor at Playboy magazine, the very white and Jewish Murray Fisher, did much of the book&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>Haley&rsquo;s unsuspecting archivists had given Nobile access to the various letters, diaries, drafts, notes, and audiotapes that Haley had kept. They were a veritable gold mine, theretofore unexplored. In working his way trough them, Nobile came to understand the depths of Haley&rsquo;s &#8220;elegant and complex make-it-up-as-you-go-along scam.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What is heard on the tape raises further questions about Haley&rsquo;s motives. Through a translator, the imperfectly coached griot tells Haley that Portuguese soldiers helped capture Kinte and send him &#8220;back home to the Portuguese.&#8221; {snip} Haley scrubs the Portuguese out of the picture and directs the audience towards America.</p>
<p>{snip}. The notion that an oral historian could recall the life of an ordinary young boy two hundred years prior surpasses the preposterous. &#8220;There was no Kunta Kinte,&#8221; says Nobile bluntly.</p>
<p>Nobile and an African-American coauthor put a book proposal together on the subject, but as Nobile ruefully admits, &#8220;Nobody wanted to touch it.&#8221; A Lexis search shows shockingly little follow-up by the media, major or minor.</p>
<p>The New York Times buried the issue in a page 18 &#8220;Book Notes&#8221; column. {snip}</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Pulitzer people did not ask for their award back, and the book and video have remained a staple in history classes across America. Nobile blames Roots&rsquo;s seeming immunity on his progressive colleagues. &#8220;They were all too scared, or dishonest,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;to admit to the public that the most famous black writer had lied about his ancestry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sound familiar?<br>

		<p>Mr. Rocco Landesman is another gushing liberal, who does not check his facts: Woodrow Wilson wrote several books, Calvin Coolidge wrote his autobiography, Richard Nixon wrote several books. Obama may not have written anything attributed to him. He certainly is not the first president since to Theodore Roosevelt to have had a book published.</p>

		<p>It would be useful to use the Internet to gather SPECIFIC <br>
facts from President Obama&rsquo;s books that appear at variance with reality.  A small matter, for example, is an account of his mother&rsquo;s alleged trauma at finding a mob-like reaction in a small Texas town circa 1952 or so when she, Stanley Ann Dunham, was playing in daylight in her yard with a Black child.  In fact,<br>
this sort of inter-racial conduct at that time  in the Dunham&rsquo;s hometown of El Dorado, Kansas, would have engenedered scandal-level gossip, raw verbal admonition, and ostracism.  There is uttely no factual basis for Stanley Ann&rsquo;s shock and dismay.</p>

<i>&ldquo;This is the first president that actually writes his own books since Teddy Roosevelt&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is a side issue but I&rsquo;ve gotten into discussions about the use of the phrase &#8216;first since&rsquo; before.</p>
<p>I believe the correct usage should be &#8216;only the second since&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Using the term &#8216;first since&rsquo; appears to be to be a way of creating a pseudo claim of originality.</p>

<p>Bill Ayers wrote Obama&rsquo;s book.  I think most everybody is aware of that, except ALL blacks and many sycophantic white radicals who are in denial.</p>
<p>If Obama&rsquo;s past writings could be accessed it would be more than plain for anybody to see.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to write on a college student&rsquo;s level one day, then be polished and professional the next, yet the fools in the media just won&rsquo;t admit it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s in dispute, as should be a &#8220;gushing&#8221; review from a person - the chairperson for the National Endowment for the Arts, no less - who doesn&rsquo;t know grammar well enough to distinguish between &#8220;that&#8221; and &#8220;who.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And before Roots there was the Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley.  Check out later bios of Malcolm and forget the movie.  Haley was a powerful propagandist who told white-guilt liberals what they wanted to hear.  Sadly, his fictions are taught as truths in politically correct schools and universities.-=======  &mdash;  -Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>When there is affirmative action, blacks are promoted well beyond their level of incompetence.  Plagiarism of better writers is one way for them to provide output they are incapable of.  Martin Luther King <a> plagiarized his entire doctoral dissertation.</a></p>
<p>Jayson Blair rose rapidly at <i>The New York Times</i>.  He seemed mature beyond his years, but then he was stealing the work of mature writers as well as <a>making up stories.</a>  Blair is now a &#8220;life coach.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In 1980, Janet Cooke, then a reporter with the <i>Washington Post</i> made up a story about an eight-year-old heroin addict in the District of Columbia. She won a Pulitzer for the story.   When the <i>Post</i> discovered she fabricated her résumé as well as they story, the <i>Post</i> returned the Pulitzer. </p>
<p>Some might think that blacks can&rsquo;t be held to the same standards; after all, that would lead to a disparate impact in body counts in newsrooms.  </p>

		<p>Another particular &#8220;hollow brick&#8221; in the autobiographical (?)<br>
effort is the &#8220;issue&#8221; of Stanley Ann Dunham (Obama/ Soweto ) and<br>
her masculinzed name &#8220;Stanley&#8221;. In fact, in school systems of<br>
her day, the issue would not have been permitted to arise, as teachers routinely &#8220;handled&#8221; such problems by adopting unilaterally a suitable name.  This often arose at that time from<br>
misspellings on birth certificates, sometimes from mean spirited<br>
misnomers put on birth certificates, etc.  The name albatross was of schizoid / schizophrenic?/  Ann Dunham&rsquo;s own making  &mdash;  a convoluted attention-getting ploy by a remarkably asocial, disturbed person (who, of course, turns out to be a social-ist!)<br>
Her own paternal grandmother, Ruth Lucille Armour, killed herself at age 26, having married at age 15 to Ralph Waldo Emerson Dunham, several years her senior.  DREAMS OF MY FATHER appears to be a displacement as radical as Freudian dreamwork <br>
distortions of a life that might in reality be termed &#8220;Nightmares of my Mother&#8221;  President Bambi O&rsquo;Mama?  </p>

		<p>  Roots is the most anti-white book of all time. Even Alex Haley ended up thinking that it was too harsh. I can&rsquo;t think of a single positive white character in the whole television mini-series. Of course, the book was a hoax. </p>

		<p>I remember that, when growing up in Gary Indiana, &#8220;Roots&#8221; was the big craze on TV. In a city that was increasingly becoming black and where the resentment towards whites was already palpable, this additional dose of propaganda was pretty hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Later, at the college I attended, Alex Haley was a speaker at one of the convocations. In fact, he was made an honorary &#8220;dean&#8221; of the college. I remember being convinced that he was not such a bad sort after all. </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until about 10 or 15 years later that I heard, <i>in passing,</i> and on a general interest podcast not listened to by very many, that Haley had plagiarized large portions of his book. This was years after the fact had come to light, but it was a complete revelation to me.  The news had been completely absent from the MSM (in stark contrast, for example, with Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s supposed affair with Sally Hemmings).</p>
<p>The media has its black gods that it must elevate at all costs. Most or all of them, on closer examination, turn out to be made of tin.</p>

		<p>On the Lincoln book subject; It is true that he did not write any books, but he did write some poetry.  It is possible to find his poems in a book at Amazon, along with other books by former presidents, including George Washington.</p>
<p>This is probably Lincoln&rsquo;s most well known poem;</p>
<p> My Childhood Home I See Again</p>
<p><br>
My childhood&rsquo;s home I see again,<br>
And sadden with the view;<br>
And still, as memory crowds my brain,<br>
There&rsquo;s pleasure in it too.</p>
<p>O Memory! thou midway world<br>
&#8216;Twixt earth and paradise,<br>
Where things decayed and loved ones lost<br>
In dreamy shadows rise,</p>
<p>And, freed from all that&rsquo;s earthly vile,<br>
Seem hallowed, pure, and bright,<br>
Like scenes in some enchanted isle<br>
All bathed in liquid light.</p>
<p>As dusky mountains please the eye<br>
When twilight chases day;<br>
As bugle-tones that, passing by,<br>
In distance die away;</p>
<p>As leaving some grand waterfall,<br>
We, lingering, list its roar  &mdash;  <br>
So memory will hallow all<br>
We&rsquo;ve known, but know no more.</p>
<p>Near twenty years have passed away<br>
Since here I bid farewell<br>
To woods and fields, and scenes of play,<br>
And playmates loved so well.</p>
<p>Where many were, but few remain<br>
Of old familiar things;<br>
But seeing them, to mind again<br>
The lost and absent brings.</p>
<p>The friends I left that parting day,<br>
How changed, as time has sped!<br>
Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray,<br>
And half of all are dead.</p>
<p>I hear the loved survivors tell<br>
How nought from death could save,<br>
Till every sound appears a knell,<br>
And every spot a grave.</p>
<p>I range the fields with pensive tread,<br>
And pace the hollow rooms,<br>
And feel (companion of the dead)<br>
I&rsquo;m living in the tombs.</p>
<p>&gt; We ought to give credit where it is due and not get hung-up on irrelevant details in an article.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;Gen Dagworthy:   So how does this account for Mike Barnicle of the Boston Globe, David Arenson of USA Today, Monica Crowley syndicated columnist, Joseph Corsi, author, Doris Kearns Goodwin, historian, Stpehen Glass, former journalist, now independent writer.  I could go on.&#8221;   Greg <br>

No doubt you could, as there far, far more white writers than black ones.  <br>
But the simple fact is, frankly,  that I have never heard of any of those above writers.  They are not considered  &#8220;Great Writers&#8221; or  towering cultural heroes, such as Hailey and MLK are to blacks.   Nobody has accused Shaw or Milton or Shakespeare or Dickens of being a plagiarist.</p>

		<p>Roots was thought to be historical by most whites and blacks.</p>
<p>The media gave gushing reviews of it and by the last episode, almost the entire nation was watching it.  There was no dissent by anyone in the media.  No historian raised any challenge to anything in the story.  Politicians praised it, and it was beamed around the nation and even the world as the undisputed truth.  </p>
<p>It was not until years later as I read many history books did I come to realize that slavery existed all over the world.  It was in fact America and England that constantly had qualms over it and led the world in abolishing it, even over the objections of many African nations who were profiting from it.  Roots was really just an anti-white propaganda film.</p>

<p>Whiteplight:  Thanks for posting that.  I had not known that Lincoln wrote poetry.  I&rsquo;m floored - it&rsquo;s pretty good, at least to my, perhaps, undiscerning ear.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Lincoln did not pursue a career where this particular talent might have led.  America might have gained a great poet - and 600,000 men would have gained their full lives.</p>

		<p>Greg (#24),</p>
<p>This is not about color, this is about culture.  A relentless political force in the United States has been working for decades to undermine and destroy the individualist, free-market, Christian values of the original European builders of this country.   One aspect of that is to remove traditional heroes and create new ones that embody the collectivist values of those who despise Western civilization.</p>
<p>Applying this to published work, two of the Founders, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, left a large body of written work that they created themselves.  Much of this written work, such as Jefferson&rsquo;s <i>Declaration of Independence</i> and Washington&rsquo;s <i>Farewell Address</i>, are foundational for the development of our country.    Today, many would ban the <i>Declaration of Independence</i> from schools, since Jefferson mentions &#8220;God&#8221; in the first sentence, and if Washington&rsquo;s warnings about the future in the <i>Farewell Address are read in any public school, I would like to know which one.  Instead, the counter-culture must always repeat that Jefferson and Washington were slave owners, and therefore, their values should be ignored.  The story that Jefferson fathered a child with Sally Hemmings must receive wide publication, and only scholars note that there were other men who also had Jefferson&rsquo;s Y-chromosome and it impossible to prove that they were not the father. </i></p>
<p>This is one of the lens through which the liberal MSM views stories: whites bad, blacks good.  White European values have created a society which is irredeemably bad.  Martin Luther King, plagiarist, with dozens of adulterous trysts, and with several communists in his inner circle, was charismatic, but incapable of creating his own written work.  His plagiarism of almost everything he wrote must be hidden while he is worshipped with his own holiday; the only other person to have a separate holiday is Jesus Christ.   Indeed, it is acceptable to invoke King in public discourse, but not Christ&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Haley, whose name was on the plagiarized book <i>Roots</i>, was a perfect vehicle for the television propaganda spectacle that was <i>Roots</i>.  The television show message was propaganda again: white society bad, blacks good  </p>
<p>For Janet Cooke, it was widely reported in the press that she received over $1 million for the movie rights to her story.</p>
<p>Jayson Blair has done nicely too.  Howell Raines, editor of <i>The New York Times</i> when Jayson Blair was exposed, admitted that Blair was promoted quickly because of his race.   One would think Blair would vanish in disgrace.  Instead, he is speaking this Friday at the Journalism Ethics Institute at Washington and Lee University in Virginia.  That&rsquo;s the college named for George Washington who gave it financial support.  After the Civil War, Robert E. Lee was the college president until his death in 1870, when the school was renamed to honor both these great Americans.   The fact that Jayson Blair is invited to give an address on journalistic ethics at the site of Washington&rsquo;s generosity and Lee&rsquo;s burial is a clear  message on who the counter-culture honors.<br>
