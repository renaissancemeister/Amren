<h1><a href="https://www.gallup.com/poll/123944/Little-Obama-Effect-Views-Race-Relations.aspx">Little &#8220;Obama Effect&#8221; on Views About Race Relations</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Newport, Gallup, October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A majority of Americans, 56%, believe that a solution to America&rsquo;s race-relations problem will eventually be worked out  &mdash;  a figure that is roughly the same as those Gallup found in the years prior to last fall&rsquo;s historic election of Barack Obama as president.</p>
<p>National Adult Trend: Will White-Black Relations in U.S. Always Be a Problem, or Will There Be an Eventual Solution?</p>
<p>Responses to this long-standing trend today are almost exactly where they were in December 1963, when Gallup first asked this question. Fifty-five percent of Americans in 1963 were hopeful that a solution to the race-relations problem would eventually be worked out. Now, some 46 years later, the &#8220;hopeful&#8221; percentage is an almost identical 56%. In short, despite all that has happened in the intervening decades, there is scarcely more hope now than there was those many years ago that the nation&rsquo;s race-relations situation will be solved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gallup conducted a one-night poll on Nov. 5 of last year, the day after Obama&rsquo;s electoral victory over John McCain. The percentage of Americans giving the positive alternative to the race-relations question in that survey jumped to 67%.</p>
<p>Now, about a year after Obama&rsquo;s election, optimism that a solution to the country&rsquo;s race problem will eventually be worked out has settled back down to 56%. This certainly remains higher than in a number of previous years, particularly at points in the 1990s. But the current reading is not significantly improved from the sentiment that prevailed in more recent years prior to Obama&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>Blacks continue to give much more negative responses to this question than do whites. The majority of whites are optimistic that a solution will eventually be worked out; the majority of blacks disagree.</p>
<p>Black, White Trends: Will White-Black Relations in U.S. Always Be a Problem, or Will There Be an Eventual Solution?</p>
<p>Among blacks, optimism about an eventual solution to race-relations problems has decreased since last summer, from 50% to 42%. In fact, the current 42% is essentially the same percentage that Gallup measured among blacks on several previous occasions.</p>
<p><b>Equal Job Opportunities?</b></p>
<p>A second Gallup trend question asks if blacks have as good a chance as whites &#8220;in your community&#8221; to get any kind of job for which they are qualified.</p>
<p>National Adult Trend: Do You Think Blacks Have as Good a Chance as Whites in Your Community to Get Any Kind of Job for Which They Are Qualified?</p>
<p>In the current poll, 79% of Americans say blacks have equal employment opportunities. This is technically the highest positive response measured to date, albeit just two points higher than what Gallup measured in the 1998 survey. Compared to last summer, the current figure represents an increase of eight percentage points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was a sea change in attitudes by the time Gallup next asked the question, in 1978, with 67% of Americans in the summer of that year agreeing that blacks had equal opportunities. Sentiment remained at roughly this level through the mid-1990s, and then rose to 75% in 1997 and 77% in 1998.</p>
<p>Here again, as was the case for the broad question about eventual solutions to the race-relations problem, Americans&rsquo; attitudes today are positive, but not dramatically or significantly higher than at various points prior to Obama&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>Blacks are decidedly more pessimistic about equal job opportunities for blacks than are whites.</p>
<p>Black, White Trends: Do You Think Blacks Have as Good a Chance as Whites in Your Community to Get Any Kind of Job for Which They Are Qualified?</p>
<p>A large majority of whites say blacks have as good a chance as whites to get any type of job for which they are qualified. Blacks, on the other hand, are divided in their views. The current perceptions among blacks of the job situation for blacks represents an improvement from recent years, although at one point in 1995  &mdash;  after O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s acquittal  &mdash;  blacks were slightly more optimistic than they are now.</p>
<p><b>Racism</b></p>
<p>A third Gallup trend asks Americans about racism against blacks in the U.S. At the beginning of last summer  &mdash;  after Obama had essentially clinched the Democratic nomination  &mdash;  56% of Americans agreed that there was widespread racism against blacks in the U.S. That percentage has now dropped to 51%. The slight drop over the last 20 months has occurred to some degree among both blacks and whites.</p>
<p>2008-2009 Trend Among National Adults, Blacks, Whites: Is Racism Against Blacks Widespread in the U.S.?</p>
<p>There has been a slight uptick (from 41% to 44%) in the percentage of Americans who perceive widespread racism against whites in the U.S. Again, the overall increase reflects increases among both blacks and whites.</p>
<p>2008-2009 Trend Among National Adults, Blacks, Whites: Is Racism Against Whites Widespread in the U.S.?</p>
<p><b>Bottom Line</b></p>
<p>Despite the election of the first black president in U.S. history, {snip}, optimism about race relations is now almost identical to where it was 46 years ago, when Gallup first asked the question.</p>
<p>Blacks remain significantly more negative than whites about their status in society and about the potential for an eventual solution to the race problem. The data do not suggest that blacks have become disproportionately more positive than whites as a result of Obama&rsquo;s election as president.</p>

		<p>Some how I imagine that the number of whites who don&rsquo;t have to compete against blacks for jobs and suffer the &#8220;we gave it to the black man so he wouldn&rsquo;t sue us&#8221; routine. Along with the whites who live in the Whitopias spoken about a few weeks ago are the ones who say there is racism and that a solution can be found.</p>
<p>Eventually whites will become realist hopefully before it is too late.</p>

		<p>Despite propaganda designed to convince everyone the exact opposite, going on 24/7, nearly as many whites and blacks both say whites face widespread racism. Apparently This isn&rsquo;t really news, and isn&rsquo;t worthy of discussion, for this information appears only as a footnote at the end, and isn&rsquo;t discussed.  </p>

		<p>Count me as part of the 44% that do not believe America&rsquo;s race- relations problem will be worked out.  The election of the great messiah has not altered my belief in this regard.  In fact, I predict the slow-motion train wreck that is the Obama presidency will bring many more people around to my way of thinking.  </p>

<p>Funny, but I am suddenly remembering what Thomas Jefferson wisely said about &#8216;the two races, equally free, cannot live under the same government&rsquo;, or something very close to that.</p>
<p>I think that as time goes on, more and more White Americans are realizing that the incompatibilities that are impossible to erase between Whites and Blacks will eventually force our two groups to agree to separate.   I see no other long term solution that ensures that Whites can survive as a viable ethnic group, free from never ending demands for concessions, free from having to walk on egg-shells whenever thin-skinned, far too easily offended Blacks are around and within ear shot.</p>
<p>All evidence that I see points to the very untenable insistence that Blacks and other non-whites place upon Whites that we are to not to be allowed or permitted to have and express our legitimate ethnic interests or to be proud of our race and wish to avoid miscegenation with non-whites.  Also, why does the mainstream media go out of their way to instill this sort of thinking in the non-white populations - to deliberately inflame animosities between whites and non-whites?   </p>
<p>So, how on Earth can whites co-exist inside the same geographic territory with other races who will not even acknowledge that we have a legitimate and moral right to survive and live in communities which consist of our own people without being called racists or white &#8216;supremacists&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>For whites to survive - whites must have their own homelands, their own exclusive living space, and this is the one thing that few minorities will accept voluntarily.    </p>
<p>Why is that, I wonder?</p>

		<p>That race relations will &#8220;eventually be worked out&#8221; implies an infinite time frame in which gravity ensures that all relations will eventually be worked out.  What an absurd question.</p>

		<p>exactly what is americas race relations problem? whites do not spend their whole waking day concerned about race, they have jobs to go to and could care less. blacks on the other hand are consumed with race and constantly accuse whites of racism. the racism that exists in america is coming from blacks, and could be more accurately described as insecurity or jeolousy, or hatred. are we supposed to be consumed by, and discuss race 24 hours a day. they need to make a law that race cannot be discussed or even mentioned, then it would go away because blacks couldn&rsquo;t mention it. period. blacks are the racists, not whites. i personally do not constantly want my thoughts and conversations to be about their blackness.</p>

<p>Luke, Your comment just reminded me of something. In the 60&rsquo;s or early 70&rsquo;s a government report stated that the two main causes of species extinction were hunting and LOSS OF HABITAT. Maybe we Whites need to get on the endangered species list.</p>

		<p>CNN had a show (I did not watch) called &#8220;Latinos in America&#8221;? I believe.  The ads talked about whites becoming a minority. I think this is the reason so many illegals are welcomed into this country by the left and I believe Obama is pushing this, he seems to have by past associations and actions, intitlement attitude that he and his people have against white America. Race relations will not improve until they can own us.</p>

		<p>For me to answer that quesntion, you would first have to define just what our &#8220;race-relations problem&#8221; actualy is. I sincerely doubt my interpretation of this &#8220;problem&#8221; would be the same as the pollster&rsquo;s!!</p>

<p>Why is that, I wonder?<br>
=============================<br>
It&rsquo;s all very simple, really. All other races know that, all other things being equal, a group of white people set down in a wilderness or in the face of a massive disaster will unite, organize, help each other, build or rebuild, plant, improve and thrive. Other NAM will lay down and cry for the &#8220;gubbmint&#8221; to &#8220;hep&#8221; them. White people are also exceedingly generous, sharing with people of other ethnicities and cultures, often to their own detriment in an effort to get these other people &#8220;up to speed&#8221;, by feeding, clothing, housing and educating them and their endless hordes of children, and it never, ever works. <br>
White people simply cannot and will not live in the self-imposed chaos that other races seem to create and thrive in. Liberals call this chaos &#8220;vibrant diversity&#8221;. Ordinary white people call it a mess and usually set about trying to regain law and order and peace and serenity. This is why white people  prosper, the world over, and why all other cultures try to live where we have created a space for ourselves. They intuitively know it is better where we live, but being incapable of creating it themselves, they try to live with us. In a very short time they realize that if too many of them invade our space, it becomes just like the place they left, as they not only cannot  build, they cannot even maintain what was already built and given to them. (eg Detroit, Zimbabwe, et al&hellip;)  </p>
