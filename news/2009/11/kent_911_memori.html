<h1>Kent 9/11 Memorial on Hold Over Inscription and Intent</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Koonz, News-Times (Danbury, Connecticut), November 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As much as Gadiel [Peter Gadiel, whose son, Jamie, was killed in the 9/11 attacks in New York] wants his son to be remembered as one of the 3,000 victims who were killed that day, he wants the 9/11 co-conspirators  &mdash;  the &#8220;Muslim extremists,&#8221; he calls them  &mdash;  to be remembered as murderers.</p>
<p>This fall, Gadiel and the Kent Board of Selectmen have been at odds over the best way to pay tribute to Jamie, a true favorite son.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gadiel wants six lines inscribed on a plaque that will be set in a stone on the Town Hall&rsquo;s front lawn:</p>
<p>James Gadiel<br>
Born February 3, 1978<br>
A gentleman and a gentle man<br>
A lifelong resident of Kent<br>
Murdered by Muslim extremists<br>
September 11, 2001</p>
<p>It is the fifth line  &mdash;  &#8220;murdered by Muslim extremists&#8221;  &mdash;  that has struck a nerve in this quaint New England town and all across America on network TV, national talk radio, blogs and other forums primed for debate.</p>
<p>Kent First Selectman Ruth Epstein and the Board of Selectmen have asked Gadiel to strike the &#8220;murdered by Muslim extremists&#8221; line from his son&rsquo;s planned memorial.</p>
<p>Town officials say the wording isn&rsquo;t supported by residents, whose money would be used to pay for a memorial plaque.</p>
<p>Gadiel, a 30-year Kent resident, refuses to delete the &#8220;murdered by Muslim extremists&#8221; line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people are still in favor of some kind of tasteful memorial at Town Hall,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m still willing to do that, but absolutely not with those words (murdered by Muslim extremists).&#8221;</p>
<p>Gadiel does not mince his feelings for Epstein and her successor, Selectman Bruce Adams, who was elected first selectman Tuesday and will take office Dec. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing but contempt for the two of them,&#8221; Gadiel said Friday. &#8220;If this is their idea of remembering my son, I don&rsquo;t want his name even remotely associated with this town.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many family members (of 9/11 victims) have called and supported me,&#8221; Gadiel said. &#8220;People need to know the truth about the people who murdered my son and 3,000 other people.&#8221;</p>

is the truth. However, in this country, daring to say the truth is considered a CRIME, but actually murdering is forgiven, as long as it&rsquo;s muslim extremists doing the murdering.</p>

		<p> Jamie Gadiel should be remembered by the citizens of Kent. And yes, the fact that he and 3,000 others were murdered by Muslim extremists (no quote marks   &mdash;   there is no doubt that&rsquo;s what they were) should be remembered, too.</p>
<p> Are such words &#8220;incendiary&#8221;? I surely hope so. It is time America gets good and mad over such incidents   &mdash;   mad enough to do something about it; as mad as we were 68 years ago after Pearl Harbor. And mad enough to DEMAND that our leaders quit trying to deny the obvious and play games with words. &#8220;Incendiary words&#8221; are very appropriate; because we&rsquo;re burned up.</p>

<p><b>Nor should he.</b>  What&rsquo;s next, does city council want him to pretend his son wasn&rsquo;t murdered at all, just to pacify Islam? </p>
<p>There is no appeasing them. </p>

		<p>Hooray for Gadiel, standing his ground!   </p>
<p>We should bear in mind that the only difference between a &#8220;muslim extremist&#8221; and a regular, run-of-the-mill, average ordinary muslim is simply that muslim&rsquo;s decision to get serious about his religion.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the wording should be changed.  The word &#8220;extremist&#8221; is superfluous. </p>

		<p>No surprise that trying to keep up this multicultural melting pot fantasy land is more important than the true details of the deaths of so many innocent people during 9/11.</p>

		<p>I live in Brittany, France.</p>
<p>In my local village is a memorial to some Breton civilians who were killed by the Nazi&rsquo;s during WW2.</p>
<p>It lists their names and bluntly says - &#8220;Victims of German barbarity&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the Germans had gone around America killing innocent people that inscription would not be allowed.</p>
<p>Wake up America.</p>
<p>Ask yourselves why your Government will not let you speak the truth.</p>
<p>Ask yourself who they now work for - who is pulling their strings.</p>
<p>It may already be too late. <br>

		<p>I must assume from their objections that the inhabitants of this rather peculiar little town believe that any old Muslims could have been responsible.  I would suggest that the statement on the plaque close with the words, &#8220;Killed by Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;d not have to worry about that dreadfully pejorative term &#8220;extremists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Mr. Engle - you write that we need to be as mad as we were when Pearl Harbor occured. That won&rsquo;t happen in today&rsquo;s society. I was a child then, and my father, with three children, was drafted. The greatest generation knew what our country was all about. Today, we are a fractured nation with many of the people here knowing nothing about Pearl Harbor, or even native-born Americans only getting a footnote in history on that war . They don&rsquo;t know the founders norr the heroes who made this country what it was until things changed. It has been a gradual takeover of leftist who want nothing more than to implement a world government. We have opened our borders and closed our minds to freedom and liberty.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;We have opened our borders and closed our minds to freedom and liberty&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not to take away from your fine post, but I would tweek your statement so it reads as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our borders have been opened, our minds closed to freedom and liberty by a hostile elite that desires to impose a NWO on us against our wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also you write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;native-born Americans only getting a footnote in history on that war. They don&rsquo;t know the founders norr the heroes who made this country what it was until things changed.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers, according to the masters that write school textbooks and control the curriculum, are irrelevant because they were slave holders.  That trumps anything they may have said or written, I&rsquo;ve heard them contemptuously called &#8216;old dead White men&rsquo; by those who educate children.  </p>
<p>I expect newer editions of textbooks to eradicate them completely  &mdash;  already blacks and hispanics are given overblown credit for &#8216;helping to found and create this country&rsquo; and winning WWI and WWII.  Slavery is depicted as solely an institution started and propagated by White Western Civilization  &mdash;   and that it was the likes of Harriet Tubman that ended it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a 40 year change as the lefties &#8216;marched through the institutions&rsquo; cumulating with their ultimate victory:  The election of a teflon president, any criticism of whom is axiomatically deemed racist by the government-controlled press.  The hostile elites control the president, the government, the msm and the schools (some say the election process as well, and I wouldn&rsquo;t argue with that notion  &mdash;  how did a jerk like Frankin go from clearly losing the election in Minnesota to clearly winning the election a few weeks later as ballots were &#8216;found&rsquo; in usual places?)  </p>
<p>Their imposition of an authoritarian state to benefit themselves is profoundly divergent from what the Founding Fathers created for their progeny and NOT what the vast majority of Native Born Whites want.</p>
