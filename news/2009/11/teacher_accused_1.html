<h1>Teacher Accused of Putting Hit on Student</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WSB-TV (Atlanta), November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local teacher was arrested on suspicion of putting a hit on one of his students.</p>
<p>Randolph Forde, a 10th-grade teacher at Mundy&rsquo;s Mill High School in Clayton County, is accused of trying to persuade another student to kill a 16-year-old boy.</p>
<p>{snip}. The student&rsquo;s mother said her son came home frightened when he found out.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says, &#8216;Ma, you&rsquo;re not going to believe this but Mr. Forde offered another student money to kill me,&rsquo;&#8221; said mother Marcia Killebrew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Killebrew&rsquo;s attorney said the incident began when Forde called the student out of the classroom one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Forde) asked him if he was gay,&#8221; said attorney Terrance Madden.</p>
<p>Madden said the student became angry at the suggestion and the next day the two had a verbal altercation.</p>
<p>Weeks later, police said, Forde got a Mundy&rsquo;s Mill student off a school bus and told him he had a hit on someone and needed him to take care of it. Officers said the student asked who it was and Forde said he would let him know.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teacher held a piece of paper up with the victim&rsquo;s name on it,&#8221; said Otis Willis III of the Clayton County Police Department.</p>
<p>Forde was arrested and faces making terroristic threats charges. He could lose his job.</p>
<p>His attorney told Jones that Forde was joking and never gave anyone a name.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black teacher asks one student to murder another. Forde was arrested and faces making terroristic threats charges.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Can you imagine the racist discrimination this man faces for such a trivial matter?</p>
<p>Newspaper:  &#8220;He could lose his job.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, even the newspaper is saying he could lose his job, knowing that just contracting for murder isn&rsquo;t something blacks will get punished for, BUT HE MIGHT. </p>

		<p>The school or police did not handle this right.  They should have instructed the student to say to the teacher &#8220;I have a friend who can help you&#8221;  The friend would then be someone who works undercover with the police to gather further evidence about the hit.</p>
<p>But instead, they left the teacher a way out.  He now says he was just joking, and the student will be the one put on trial.  A liberal jury will quickly become confused on who is the victim.</p>
<p>#1 and 2 you guys make a good point. &#8220;He could lose his job&#8221; <br>
Well I hope he loses his job.  He should also do 20 years or so.</p>

		<p>Obviously the teacher is gay, he was trying to put a move on the kid he hoped was gay too, and when the kid turned out to not be a viable prospect, the teacher was hoping to have him bumped off before the kid put two and two together and blabbed about Mr. Forde being homosexual. Is the intended victim white?  Either way, imagine the coverage if a white teacher did this. </p>

		<p>I have to wonder whether the teacher took the black student aside and privately asked if he were gay because he wanted to proposition him.</p>
<p>Sounds like another brother on the down low.</p>

		<p>It says he &#8220;could&#8221;  lose his job!  Really?!!!  I&rsquo;m shocked. The poor fellow. How harsh of them.</p>
<p>This is laughable. Should there be any possible question about it?  </p>
<p>Oh well, he didn&rsquo;t actually murder anyone. So I suppose that makes it OK.   More African logic.</p>

<p><br>
Are you kidding? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous!  No &#8220;gay&#8221; person would ask another person a blunt question like that. I took it as a very hostile question (and perhaps the kid really is gay). Obviously, the teacher didn&rsquo;t like him and was looking to make trouble for him somehow. Blacks are the most notorious of bigots. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just as likely this is some kind of gang-rite, or simply an attempt to condition or blackmail the teacher. This is an Atlanta school. That black pride stuff is nonsense. Even the dumbest black students are smart enough to know it&rsquo;s hoowie.</p>

		<p>When they say that Forde was arrested for making terroristic threats and could lose his job that&rsquo;s about all the news can say in an incident like this. </p>
<p>That may be all they can arrest him for and charge him with but my guess is that Forde is in a lot more trouble than he thinks right now. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that he will lose his job but with something like that on his record I doubt if any school system in the country would hire him. Making terroristic threats is not a joke because he could end up doing time and the community is not happy with this guy so there won&rsquo;t be any blow back if he ends up in the poky. </p>
<p>It just goes to show how stupid some people can be. He had a pretty good life and career and just threw it all away to act like a punk kid. There are elections coming up so no black leaders would even dare come to his rescue. Mr. Forde is now just another criminal. </p>

		<p>The important thing to get here is that the &#8220;hitman&#8221; he tried to hire was another student.</p>
<p>That a teacher might do something like this is psychotic.  Something is clearly wrong with him.  But, for him to even think there is a remote possibility that he could hire someone to commit a murder from the student body shows that insanity is institutionalized.</p>
<p>THAT IS NOT A SCHOOL.  It&rsquo;s a holding ground for violent criminals who can and DO commit murders on a regular basis.  They are only going through the motions of being a school.  What are they REALLY doing there?  Nothing good if it involves the availability of murder for hire.</p>
<p>We take for granted that, in this country, everyone has a right to an education, no matter who they are or what their abilites.  But, on a large scale, that ideal is being used against us&hellip;.as so many idealistic institutions are used against us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students&#8221; should be given IQ tests to make sure they have some minimal aptitude to benefit from an education.  Schools should be closely monitored to make sure that EDUCATION is what is taking place there.  Troublemakers should be swiftly punished or expelled.  Criminal acts should result in the criminal going to prison for long stretches of time.  Murderers should be exectuted.  Not after 20 years on death row but after 20 days on death row.</p>
<p>That change won&rsquo;t happen until the last bastions of liberalism are ground out.  And with Obama, it&rsquo;s becoming possible to get the entire nation down with this.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>

<p>Just because they&rsquo;ve dressed up Randolph in a shirt and trousers and forged affirmative action credentials for him, does not mean that he is actually a teacher. Rather, he is simply another affirmative action case who is masquerading as something that he is not.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually believe that Randolph is actually a teacher, in any sense of the word?</p>
<p>The truth is that citizens in civilized society have been conditioned to pretend that he is a teacher. They have been coerced and forced to do through decades of relentless affirmative action rhetoric espoused by egalitarians and people with a monetary agenda.</p>
<p>Of course, pretending that something is real or legitimate does not make it so.</p>
<p>I wonder how many legitimate, REAL teachers with REAL credentials were passed over so that Randolph could fill a quota to satisfy the imaginary views and the agenda of egalitarians?</p>

		<p>In this society at this time any black person losing a job must have committed such a grevious act it is incomprehensible.  Normally you just can&rsquo;t get rid of them.  Imagine.</p>
<p>Do you really believe this man is a qualified teacher? or merely another affirmative action placement.</p>

		<p>He &#8220;could&#8221; lose his job   &mdash;   priceless.  In other words, contracting out for murder, Mafia-style, may be a felony, but it just might not be enough to get this teacher canned.  Lord, what times we live in.  </p>

		<p>The recent federal law passed makes this a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; if Forde actually thought the student was gay.  Of course, hate crimes laws are usually enforced only against whites, so this teacher-imposter will probably get a free pass on this.</p>
<p>Forde might lose his job.  Then again, he might not.  </p>
