<h1>NY Village Gets New Voting Rules to Aid Hispanics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Fitzgerald, Google News, November 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge is imposing an unusual election system on a New York village after finding the existing system was unfair to Hispanics.</p>
<p>Under the new system, residents may cast as many as six votes for one candidate.</p>
<p>The ruling could mean that the village of Port Chester, 25 miles northeast of New York City, will have trustee elections next year for the first time since 2006.</p>
<p>{snip} A voter could cast six votes for one candidate, one for each of six candidates or any other combination.</p>

		<p>My state, many years ago, was forced to change how it apportioned it&rsquo;s upper house.  We used to elect 2 State Seantors from each county, thus giving rural counties some parity with urban counties (our General Assembly was always proportional).  A Supreme Court ruling forced us to go to &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221; for our upper house, each Senate distric to be equal in population even if it meant going over county borders, destroying the original reason for an Upper House.  But a single judge can force a small village, with no money to fight, to go to &#8220;cumulative voting&#8221;.  Where is that in the constitution?</p>

I had thought I was long since immune from being outraged but I was wrong.</p>
<p>THIS CAN NOT STAND!</p>
<p>If it does, it will sweep the nation and take away any hope we have for legislating change.</p>
<p>If this precident is upheld and spreads and the priciple of ONE MAN, ONE VOTE comes to an end, we can truly say out nation is no more and all bets are off.<br>

		<p>The Justice Department better be careful what it wishes for.  There are several examples from the few places that have cumulative voting that it helps the outside-the-lamestream right wing candidates win seats on multi-member boards.</p>
<p>As an aside, Willis Carto once proposed in The Spotlight that a given state should change to statewide at-large cum vote for U.S. House elections, instead of dividing a state up into a given number of districts of approximately the same population.  What that means is that to elect Missouri&rsquo;s 9 Congress(wo)men, all the candidates would be on the ballot everywhere in the state, with 9 holes next to each of their names.  One could vote for one of the candidates 9 times, or nine candidates once, or one candidate 5 and another 4, or three each for three candidates, or any combination of 9 votes for anywhere from one to nine candidates.  The top 9 candidates in terms of total holes punched would go to Congress.  (The U.S. Constitution does not mandate Congressional districts, just a given whole number apportionment of House seats per state, each state having at least one.  Therefore, Carto&rsquo;s idea would be Constitutional.)  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a smaller state trying it out as an experiment, to see if people could grok it, and to see if it would have Carto&rsquo;s desired effect of getting right-wing Congressmen into office, but it sure would be confusing in California.</p>

		<p>The full story is worth reading.  I knew an adopted Korean girl in college and she fit the descriptions given in the article to a &#8220;T&#8221;.  It must be very common indeed.  The conflict between a feeling of being white and the daily experience of seeing an Asian face reflected in the mirror would be enough to drive anyone slightly crazy.  </p>
<p>I think things are even worse for adopted Asians than adopted blacks, for while the African child raised by white parents will acculturate to American black culture (for better or worse), the Asian will never be accepted among native Koreans, yet will never feel kinship with whites, either.  They are twice hit by Korean hyper-ethnocentrism: once at birth, when no other Korean families will adopt them, and later in life when Korean immigrants reject them as well.  This breeds destructive self-hatred.</p>
<p>Unsuprisingly, the white families who adopt these children are totally oblivious to psychological ill effects that result.</p>

		<p>Well, I knew that with the anti-White attitude of a certain liberal elite, things would get ugly&hellip; But this is beyond the pale!</p>
<p>This is an attack on democracy as we know it! What could possibly justify Hispanics getting the right to vote 6 times per person, in any election?</p>
<p>Minorities used to demand «equality»; they&rsquo;re now way past «equality». They get absolutely unfair priviledges!</p>
<p>Something has to be done about this! Just think about the future implications.</p>

		<p>This is wrong.  This is Affirmative Action and the percentage of the population.  In otherwords, it is unconstitutional, this is not based on merit or qualification, but race and nationality, and this is also the tyranny of the minority.</p>

		<p>Liberals constantly scream about how blacks only counted as 3/5 of a person before the civil war. Now they count whites as 1/6 of a hispanic, and it&rsquo;s okay? To hell with this country. </p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even break the principle of &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221;  &mdash;  normally, in elections for a six-member board, each seat on the board is voted for separately  &mdash;  each citizen gets six votes, one per seat on the board but only one per seat.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m reading this article right, what changes is that each citizen still gets six votes in the election, but can now choose to vote multiple times towards one seat on the board if they forgo voting on some of the others.</p>
<p>The question remains whether the election will still be for &#8220;Place 1&#8221;, &#8220;Place 2&#8221;, etc. or just &#8220;the six candidates that get the most votes overall are on the board&#8221;.</p>
<p>This DOESN&rsquo;T give members of &#8220;favored group A&#8221; more votes than other people.  ALL citizens get to cast six votes.  The most likely result of this is that there will be *one* minority on the board  &mdash;  which if the board does business by voting, doesn&rsquo;t mean much.</p>

		<p>Actually this is a form of proportional representation-the same type of system that has allowed European right-wing nationalist parties to elect many members to parliament. We should all  hope that it is adopted widely in the US-especially in places like the Deep South where there are still a large number of whites-though certainly a minority-with racial consciousness. </p>

		<p>Look at this way: if, back in the &#8216;90&rsquo;s, Louisiana had elected one house of the state legislature by this method, David Duke-barring term limits or felony convictions-could have had a seat for life. </p>
<p>Your opinion of David Duke is beside the point</p>
