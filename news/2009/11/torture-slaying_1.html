<h1>Torture-Slaying Hearing Reveals Alleged Racial Statement by Defendant</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hearing today revealed a statement attributed by police to torture-slaying suspect George Thomas in which he cursed one of his alleged victims.</p>
<p>Knox County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Detective Nevil Norman testified today in a hearing in Criminal Court that Thomas told him &#8220;(expletive) that white girl, she don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; to me. You cops come into my neighborhood and kill us. Why should I get involved in something that is none of my business?&#8221;</p>
<p>Norman said the statement was made after he had turned off a tape recorder he had been using to record an interrogation of Thomas on Jan. 11, 2007, in Lebanon, Ky., where Thomas had been arrested.</p>
<p>He said after the interview was over he allowed Thomas to smoke a cigarette. While Thomas was smoking, Norman said he asked Thomas if he should have called someone about what was going in the Chipman Street house where Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom were held hostage before they were killed and Thomas gave that statement in reply.</p>
<p>Norman said he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; by the statement but did not write it down for more than 17 months when he met with prosecutors and revealed the alleged statement to them.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Leland Price asked him to write a memo about the statement. That memo was dated June 24, 2008.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Tom Dillard questioned Norman, a veteran detective, on why he would have failed to document such a shocking statement.</p>
<p>Norman never directly answered. He noted only that there was &#8220;so much other stuff in this case we were trying to get organized I just didn&rsquo;t write it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas is set to stand trial Dec. 1.</p>
<p>He is facing the death penalty in the January 2007 carjacking, torture, rape and murder of Christian, 21, a University of Tennessee student, and Newsom, 23, her boyfriend and a trim carpenter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All of the defendants are black and the victims are white, but police and prosecutors have said race was not a factor in the crimes.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m waiting until one of these defendants start making race the issue themselves.  They&rsquo;ll claim that one or both white victims and/or white cops used racial slurs.  How that justifies torture, rape and murder is beyond me.</p>

		<p>He should have recorded it.  When talking to the suspect, the tape recorder should be on.  He failed.  He then didn&rsquo;t write it down.  </p>
<p>But like the Simpson trial, it realy doesn&rsquo;t matter that much because they still have a mountain of other evidence.  Everyone but the police have figured out there is a racial component to this horrible crime.</p>

		<p><i>[P]olice and prosecutors have said race was not a factor in the crimes.</i></p>
<p>Clearly, race is a factor in law enforcement; if a pack of white lowlifes had kidnapped a black couple and tortured, raped, and murdered them, the police would have been working a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; angle from the word &#8220;go.&#8221;  But since the races are not white and black, respectively, but black and white, they were &#8220;too busy&#8221; to write down evidence of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; as it came to light.</p>
<p>Heh, who do these flatheads think they&rsquo;re fooling?</p>

		<p>Black on white racial killings, beatings and assaults have been going on for years, because of racial hatred of whites by blacks who are fed the same anti-white hatred by the likes of Jeremiah Wright, Jesse and Al, et al.  In fact, Jeremiah Wright is not the exception, he&rsquo;s the norm, as is his white hating congregation.  </p>
<p>From the time they get up of a morning, until most of them pass out from drugs or alcohol at night,  blacks are bombarded with non-stop expressions of hatred for whitey and even though their failures are due to their lack of ability and intellect they eagerly accept the lies and unjust denunciations about whites &#8220;keeping them down,&#8221; reinforcing their hatred and animosity for white people everywhere.  </p>
<p>It might be a rude awakening for radical liberals to know that they&rsquo;re not exempt, and no amount of butt-kissing and black advocacy is going to exempt them from beatings or murder, the same as the most biased anti-black hater.</p>
<p>Remember the incident a few mnonths ago about the girls who were set upon by a mob of blacks who beat them to a pulp for no reason other than they were white and what the girl with the greatest injuries said, in essence?  She declared she was not a racist.  In fact, she said, she even had a black boyfriend at one time.</p>
<p>I suspect many radical leftists think their acceptance of all things black somehow exempts them from black anti-white hatred.  And, you know, I seriously doubt that the injured girl has changed her mind much about blacks in general.  Anybody that stupid can&rsquo;t take a magic pill and become smart.</p>
<p>Will the authorities ever give us justice?  The police said one of the reasons these torture murders were not racially motivated was because one of the blacks had a white girlfriend.</p>
<p>Have you quit laughing yet?</p>
<p>How unfortunate these people are to have police who are so ignorant they think that because a black takes an opportunity to satisfy his lust on a white, drugged bimbo means he couldn&rsquo;t possibly hate white people.</p>
<p>The authorities all over the country take it upon themselves, with their obvious limited intellects, to decide whether or not we should know the truth.  Do they see it as their jobs to stop repercussions from whites, so they lie about an attack or murder being racially motivated?  Of course they do.</p>
<p>And the situation won&rsquo;t change so long as whites refuse to take to the streets looking for justice.  Blacks are placated, because it is known they will riot if they are not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whites have refrained from those same expressions, or any kind of defense at all, and that has made them the favorite whipping posts of blacks everywhere.  </p>
<p>Just the threat of white uprisings would have a magical effect on the attitudes of authorities and media everywhere.  I&rsquo;m interested to know how much longer whitey will endure the abuse and injustice in abject silence?  </p>

		<p>Why are police so CORRUPT???Race wasnt a factor  &mdash;  how can anyone be such an imbecile as to bel;ieve that? Obviously the whole concept of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; a foreign,alien concept that is surely NOT American,is to deny white men the freedoms promised us under OUR constitution,namely equal protection. </p>

We all know that when there&rsquo;s a confrontation where the white person is believed to be the instigator that investigators base their questions on the presumption that the white person is a racists and look for self-incriminating statements.</p>
<p>Investigators rarely if ever presume blacks who attack whites do so for racial reasons and don&rsquo;t pursue the same line of inquiry.</p>

		<p>The cop is essentially lying&hellip;.both on the part about being shocked and about being &#8220;too busy&#8221; to write down the comment.</p>
<p>The truth is that there is not a cop in this country that doesn&rsquo;t understand that blacks and hispanics are waging race war against whites.  They ALL understnad this and they ALL understand that, whether they want to be, or not, they are involved on the front lines of this.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they say this openly?  Why do they cover up stuff like this unless pressed hard on it?  Because, understand something, the judges, lawyers, courts, and the nice people who live more or less seggregated are not on their side.  In short, the cop here didn&rsquo;t say anything, didn&rsquo;t dare write anything down because he feared being made example of.</p>
<p>It was only when the full scope and breadth of the incredible racism that was the motivation of this crime, became undeniable that he felt he could possibly say anything.</p>
<p>The problem has been and continues to be the incredible irresponsibility of the public&hellip;.to move away, live in denial AND ATTACK THOSE WHO FIGHT BACK, in response to the continued ethnic cleansing of whites from many part of America and the rest of the western world.</p>
<p>Well, one day, there won&rsquo;t be any place left to run to anymore.</p>

At Knoxville PD, a water glass slipped off the Sergeant&rsquo;s desk, fell to the floor and shattered, but police and prosecutors have said that gravity was not a factor.</p>

		<p>A few years ago, the MSM reported that a black girl had been kidnapped by whites in southern WV and held in a trailer, raped, and smeared with feces.  For days, we were regaled with the implications.  The MSM failed to report, however, when it was learned that the &#8220;victim&#8221; was the girlfriend of one of the group!</p>

		<p>I heard yesterday on the news that the FBI is reporting that hate crimes have risen by 2% this year.  If whites were a protected class, as minorities are, I would say that crimes against whites probably have increased significantly more than 2% but since whites are not protected under the hate crime laws, one can only assume that these new statistics are probably not white on black but black on hispanic and/or asians or vice versa.  Of course, they will never report that hate crimes against minorities by other minorities is the real statistic.</p>

		<p>I have been told that there is fear within police ranks that another White will rat you out if you raise the possibility that a black-on-White crime is a hate crime. It would be an uphill battle even if you had the department&rsquo;s support to get the DA to consider prosecuting on that basis. </p>

They are not paid to be your friends. They do not make their own agenda. They are paid to follow orders from above. Promotions above a certain level are entirely political and at the caprice of those holding political office. The police are employees of the politicians who sign their paychecks and grant or withhold their promotions. They will say and do whatever the politicians tell them to say and do.<br>

		<p>Times do not change. In 1970 in Paol Alto, Ca.  a white man Herbert Kay were beaten and kicked to death by a group of Pacific Islanders out to &#8220;jack&#8221; some in Palo Alto  &mdash;  a predominately white community. The Police, DA and City fathers rejected the obvious hate crime that was supported by Talk Show Host Michael Savage.</p>

<p>To:  Rob Elder,  Editor<br>
        San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p><br>
Dear Mr. Elder,</p>
<p>As you probably know the sad murder of NASA scientist Herbert Kay has come to a close as far as the courts are concerned.</p>
<p>But, the issue of whether it was a racially motivated hate crime and whether the Palo Alto Police and the Santa Clara County District Attorney&rsquo;s office intentionally ignored and rejected the communities pleas to investigate the murder has not been resolved.<br>
Over 50 calls were made to the polcie department asking for it to be investeigated as hate crimes. </p>
<p>Under the California Public Records Act I obtained from the Santa Clara District Attorney&rsquo;s office, over 800 pages of all of the interrogation transcripts of the suspects following their arrests a few days after the incident.</p>
<p>I reviewed every page and did not find one instance where the police interrogators pursued a line of questioning that would surface if any racial animus was involved in the case, notwithstanding the fact that a suspect opened an opportunity for them to pursue that line of questioning .</p>
<p>Attached to this note is a recent news story by CNSNews about a case in Alexandria, VA.  where the Washington Times reported that the police leadership allegedly with held vital information pertaining the whether the case was racially motivated from their own officers.   Allegedly an incriminating note was not  retrieve by the police even though they were notified.  Sounds hard to believe. Maybe it&rsquo;s not true. </p>
<p>Respectfully I ask that you notify you readers about this stuff. Please let me know one way or the other. Thanks. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Louis Calabro<br>
President</p>
