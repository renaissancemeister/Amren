<h1>Black Power Has Arrived With Some New Challenges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, GOPUSA, November 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten months after Democrats took over the Capitol and the first African-American president moved into the White House, black lawmakers are in control of some of the most powerful positions in Congress  &mdash;  and face new challenges to using their long-sought influence.</p>
<p>There have been some victories  &mdash;  guaranteeing that stimulus money reaches some of the poorest parts of the country, expanding hate crimes legislation and moving to close health care disparities.</p>
<p>But &#8220;in some ways, our strategies haven&rsquo;t caught up with our own power,&#8221; said Benjamin Todd Jealous, chief executive of the NAACP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For generations, civil rights were inseparable from black politicians. That era ended with President Barack Obama, who has declined to engage in traditional black advocacy.</p>
<p>So any new efforts to help blacks who remain disproportionately unemployed, incarcerated, unhealthy and undereducated will most likely come from the 42 members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is closing all of these gaps,&#8221; said Rep. Barbara Lee, chairwoman of the caucus and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees budgetary spending. &#8220;When you look at all these huge systemic gaps, there&rsquo;s still not equality and justice for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But due to recent advances among blacks  &mdash;  Obama&rsquo;s election chief among them  &mdash;  there is a new resistance toward efforts aimed at helping black people specifically, said University of Pennsylvania history professor Mary Frances Berry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re used to being supplicants at the table,&#8221; Berry said. &#8220;Now they have to be smart. If they want to do something about unemployment, they can target those who have the highest rates. If you target education, target the lowest achievement rates. Don&rsquo;t say, &#8216;We&rsquo;re doing this for black folks&rsquo;; you say, &#8216;We want to target where the problems are.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>That strategy has been taking shape for some time, said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., who as majority whip is the third-ranking member of the House.</p>
<p>Clyburn cited an amendment in the economic recovery package that he worked on with Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to ensure that 10 percent of federal stimulus dollars are spent in areas where at least 20 percent of residents have lived in poverty for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were designing a quote-unquote affirmative action program today, that&rsquo;s what I would be using, the 10-20-30 formula,&#8221; Clyburn said. &#8220;We are finding more and more sophisticated ways of doing this on a nonracial basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said {snip} he planned to bring a bill through his committee calling for the government to study the issue of reparations to descendants of slaves. &#8220;This is not just a feel-good measure,&#8221; Conyers said. &#8220;This is very serious business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama opposes reparations and has said &#8220;the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clarke [Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y.] said that in bills such as the stimulus package, health care reform and auto industry bailouts, caucus members affect &#8220;the chemistry of the legislation&#8221; by ensuring that provisions to help minorities are included.</p>
<p>For example, the House health care bill provides billions of dollars to address the substandard health care many minorities receive. {snip}</p>

<p>His opposition is a scam.  Obama wants reparations.  The Bible tells us, &#8220;By their fruits, ye shall know them.&#8221;  With politicians, by their judicial appointments, ye shall know them.  After 4 or 8 years of an Obama-stacked judiciary, one of the judges will order reparations.</p>

<p>Wow! You cannot argue that this guy wasn&rsquo;t aptly named! Doesn&rsquo;t his name perfectly summarize the feelings of inferiority that most blacks have toward whites? </p>
<p>- Jealous of white physical appearances<br/>
- Jealous of white heritage<br/>
- Jealous of white successes<br/>
- Jealous of white education levels<br/>
- Jealous of white morals and family cohesion<br/>
- Jealous of white economies and nations</p>

		<p>Blacks are their own worst enemies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing they can manage effectively, as is quite evident when we look at Africa, Haiti, and black controlled American cities.</p>
<p>The more power they have, the worse they do.  And the obvious reason for it is their overall lack of ability and intelligence.  They would just love to get complete control of a successful Western country.  And when it eventually collapsed into a third world ghetto, they would blame racism and whitey somehow.</p>

<p>Same old same. Blacks get literally billions each year to address thier failures - which are still blamed on whitey anyway. If a poor white needs health care, a job or education then he has to join the military or work two jobs. </p>
<p>No special programs for whitey. Must be white skin privilege.</p>

There&rsquo;s a common complaint by blacks that whites only let them have power after whites have messed things up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they explain away Obamas inability to get things done or get things done the &#8216;right way&rsquo; IE, the black way.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, they say the same thing about our black mayor and black governor.</p>
<p>If you ever hear blacks making this charge, the two answers you might consider are:</p>
<p>1) it was black and minority demands for money and services that destroyed the cities  and states they now govern and</p>
<p>2) blacks made the choice to run for elected offices because they said they could do better than whites. Blacks weren&rsquo;t given this positions, they wanted them because they said they had all the answers to all the problems.</p>
<p>Blacks have no right to complain that they were elected after the mess was created because they wanted, no demanded, they were the solution.</p>

		<p>Read the story and you will see bho&rsquo;s agenda spelled out:  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to being supplicants at the table,&rdquo; Berry said. &ldquo;Now they have to be smart. If they want to do something about unemployment, they can target those who have the highest rates. If you target education, target the lowest achievement rates. Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re doing this for black folks&rsquo;; you say, &lsquo;We want to target where the problems are.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What group has the highest rate of unemployment, and what group has the lowest rate of private health insurance?  Without researching it, I am going to say blacks.  </p>

		<p>I think that a meritocracy would be fine for us but unwelcome for the minorities since if based on merit the white poor would rise to the top. Their difficulty is getting white america to continue buying the story that we are evil and are holding them back so they need to butt into line regardless of qualification differences. That tune is worn out and with an economic downturn it will evoke screams of unfairness in even the most liberal poor white.</p>

		<p>Avid Reader reports this quote from 1991:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.Civil rights laws were not passed to protect the rights of white men and do not apply to them&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Flash forward to 2009 and read this from the current AG of the US:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Holder, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee this spring, asserted that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law.</p>
<p>And to all idiot White obama voters, how is that &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; working out for you?  This is what the political elite you voted for meant by &#8216;change&rsquo;  &mdash;  an active, government-directed campaign to oppress Whites (and they call us Nazis?):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The ADL recently announced that, having spearheaded passage of The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, it will now lead stage two, a massive national campaign to train lawyers to become hate crimes prosecutors&hellip;  Attorney General [Holder] is determined to begin immediate enforcement&hellip; &#8216;on the day that it becomes law, we will hasten to begin using it&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh</a></p>
<p>Is destroying the First Amendment and Constitution of the US OK with you?  Is an anti-White authoritarian central government OK with you?</p>
<p>Results when it was tried in the USSR?  63 million dead. </p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip; I guess that is the Neo-Marxist definition of &#8220;Equal Protection Under The Law&#8221; and &#8220;The Scales of Justice are Blind&#8221;</p>
<p>Makes sense&hellip; <br/>
