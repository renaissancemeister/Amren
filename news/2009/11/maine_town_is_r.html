<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/us/15milbridge.html?_r=1">Maine Town Is Riven by Housing Dispute</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This [Milbridge] is the intended spot for a small apartment complex for farmworkers, a few hundred of whom are Hispanics living year-round in this remote corner of Down East Maine. They harvest blueberries, process seafood and assemble holiday wreaths, and most live in trailers near the fields and factories where they work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now the group, Mano en Mano  &mdash;  Spanish for Hand in Hand  &mdash;  has filed a federal lawsuit alleging discrimination under the Fair Housing Act and the equal protection clause of the Constitution. And Milbridge, which once won acclaim for its efforts to welcome and integrate immigrants, is smarting from accusations of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit and local newspaper accounts, some residents opposed the project on grounds that farmworkers&rsquo; children overburdened the schools; others predicted it would be a drug haven. The petition, signed by 48 residents, said jobs should be saved for local lobstermen, whose industry is suffering, and not &#8220;given out to minorities that may move into these units.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is another one of those stories about which I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I sympathize with anyone who is being exploited by having immigrants dumped on them. On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t help but feel these liberals deserve it. And you know they would be screaming &#8220;racism&#8221; if it were some town in Mississippi suffering this invasion rather than them. I&rsquo;m not gloating mind you. It just highlights how those libs should put their self-righteous attitudes aside and get on board.</p>

		<p>$1 million dollars for a six-unit apartment complex in the middle of nowhere?  I don&rsquo;t care if Maine has higher-than-average construction costs, etc.  Maybe it does, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t.  When you decide to move somewhere new, one of the first things you look into is how much you are likely to earn, vs. how much it costs to live in that area.  Lots of people would like to live in La Jolla, CA, or the upper East Side of Manhattan, but decide NOT to do so after realizing that the rents are too high.  $500 for a one-bedroom house is about the same as lots of small and medium-sized towns in less prosperous areas of the South, and certainly a lot less than what a one-bedroom costs in Los Angeles, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe the REAL problem is that the evil New Englanders won&rsquo;t let the Hispanics pack 30 people into a 900 square foot unit.  Ignoring zoning regulations is an important part of Hispanic culture, and it is what has made Southern California so vibrant.</p>
<p>If the sea cucumber processing plant that opened in the 1990s is able to recruit and retain Hispanics, then obviously WORKING Hispanics are not priced out of the local housing market.  The six-unit mini-slum is a time bomb, and the locals know it.</p>

<p>This is EXACTLY how it started in California  &mdash;  a few &#8216;braceros&rsquo; here and there harvesting produce, seemingly innocuous, harming no one (so we were told)  &mdash;  wishing to stay in the US, in California year-round instead of going home to mexico after the harvest, only desirous of a better life.</p>
<p>If you let this apartment building be built, this is what will happen:</p>
<p>That small apartment building will soon become over-crowded with fecund hispanics who will import their entire villages to Maine now that they&rsquo;ve got a toe-hold.  The women will immediately being to have baby after baby, all American citizens, all demanding government services. The word will soon go out that your town is hispanic friendly with lots of social services.</p>
<p>THEY will become the majority in your &#8216;once rural&rsquo; town, collapse the social system, over-take the schools, demand THEIR people be taken care of with food stamps, more government housing, more taxpayer funded bi-lingual services, and free health care as well.  Next will come the gangs and the race-based activists who will complain about White oppression and racism.  Soon, they will become a voting bloc, voting in lock-step for ethno-centric politicians who will promise them more services at White expense.</p>
<p>Your home town will become unlivable for you and you will be forced to flee to another town.  But the hispanics will follow you along with their demand to live in YOUR neighborhood at YOUR expense and they will &#8220;file  federal lawsuits alleging discrimination under the Fair Housing Act and the equal protection clause of the Constitution.&#8221;  And they will win.</p>
<p>If you, a Native Born White, deign to complain about increasing violent crime and drunken driving in your once beautiful town, ruined schools that cater to hispanics and denigrate White children, loud, blaring music played all night, parks taken over by gang members, graffiti marring your historic buildings  &mdash;  you will be called a racist Nazis and possibly be charged with hate speech.</p>
<p>YOU, unlike non-Whites, have no advocacy groups to defend you, whereas hispanics can and will easily call up heavily-funded hate groups such as La Raza, SPLC, ADL  &mdash;  who will gladly take up their cause to fight you, a racist Nazi.  You will not win. </p>
<p>Holder&rsquo;s justice department and the ADL, with their legion of highly-paid &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and &#8216;social justice&rsquo; lawyers are chomping at the bit to test drive the new hate speech law and would be happy to use you as an example of &#8216;fighting White racism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those in Maine better fight this with everything they&rsquo;ve got, it&rsquo;s their last and only chance.  If you allow even one  apartment building in your town for hispanic workers, a flood will follow  &mdash;  you have no idea what is in store for you, none of it good.</p>
<p>This is how California was destroyed. </p>

<p>Better yet, limit immigration and let the market set wages. We always read these stories about companies that cannot find people to pick fruit and butcher chickens and so forth. &#8220;They are doing the jobs that americans just won&rsquo;t do&#8221;  &mdash;  nonsense, americans will be perfectly willing to do the work if you make them the right offer. Of course, people (read: blacks) would be a lot more willing to do &#8220;the jobs that americans just won&rsquo;t do&#8221; (read: at a price we like) if it wasn&rsquo;t for welfare.</p>

		<p>Yes Bon, that is exactly what happened here and it only took about forty years. But now that California is overrun and those latinos are the predominant racial group in the state, how do you go rewind back to a pre-hispanic rennaisance of affordable housing, low crime, the best education in the country, plentiful well paying jobs, communities so safe everyone leaves their front doors open at night and few lock their vehicles, a neighbor helping neighbor mentality, etc&hellip; etc&hellip; etc&hellip;?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no going back without some very structural political changes. Maine take note.</p>

		<p>In St. Louis, some white citizens of its northern suburbs got together and tried to oppose the construction of housing projects near them in the late 1970s.  Many of those involved got knocks on the door from the FBI, the agents intimidating them that their using their 1st Amendment rights was a violation of civil rights laws, because it was well known that the housing would mainly go to blacks.</p>
<p>But at about the same time, members of the St. Louis Citizens Council were doing the same, and got no trouble from the FBI.  In fact, as a compromise, CCA members got to comprise half the board that ran the housing projects, and they were able to keep almost all the black riff-raff (but not all blacks) out of the housing project for awhile.  But the neighborhood was on the north side, and the inevitable was inevitable.</p>

SKIP the psychic read this article and predicts&hellip;&hellip;The school will crack and pay up and build accomodations for the muslims. Further, I suspect the muslims are not real muslims from Saudia or Kuwait, but black converts from the U.S.</p>

		<p>The story posted by Karen deserves an Amren entry of it&rsquo;s own. </p>
<p>In short, Lewiston, ME., school district attempts to tolerate Muslim student&rsquo;s desire to pray by saying he can pray anywhere, anytime, silently or out loud. Boy&rsquo;s immigrant father demands he be given special accommodations   &mdash;   a room of her own   &mdash;   to pray outside of the view of non-Muslim students. According to school officials, &#8220;he wouldn&rsquo;t take no for an answer.&#8221; </p>
<p>CAIR has filed a complaint. </p>
<p>The article is very fair and level, the comments; not so much. </p>

		<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that there were many unemployed folks in Maine. By folks, I mean people native to the area. If so, then why did they feel the need to import and provide for foriegn labor? And why have immigrants from Mexico? They have no cultural or historical claims to the area. </p>

		<p>I may be wrong but I thought that anti-discrimination laws were originally put in place because of the perceived oppression of certain groups that were at one time in the minority in the U.S.<br>
????<br>
I may be wrong on that interpretation.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it appears any nonwhite can come over from anywhere as recent as this morning and get benefit from these laws.</p>

		<p>Re: #5 Mike fromm MI&hellip;.</p>
<p>So your answer to paying minimum wage to immigrants to do seasonal work because the locals don&rsquo;t want to do it,  (If they did, there would have been no need to bring in anyone else.) is to have the Government provide welfare (&#8220;subsidize some or all of their wages&#8221;, to the same lazy Americans who didn&rsquo;t want to work in the first place?  </p>
<p>Those lobster men don&rsquo;t want seasonal work, they want to collect unemployment for the 11 months of the year they are not aloud to fish.</p>
<p>A better answer would be to do away with unemployment benefits&hellip;it&rsquo;s un-American to get paid to not work. As a compromise there could be a 3 month maximum on unemployment LOANS, as in you have to pay it back once you find work. Same goes for welfare&hellip;3 months max in any 10 year period.</p>
<p>Limit immigration, and enforce our laws.  Everything else will work itself out in a free market economy.</p>

		<p>White liberals should be forced to embrace the immigrants and their descendents they fight so long and hard to see imported. In my opinion, each white liberal should be forced by law to admit into their living space and care for at least one poor criminal black or latino.</p>
