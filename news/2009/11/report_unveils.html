<h1><a href="https://www.ifrc.org/Docs/News/pr09/5509.asp">Report Unveils Plight of Great Lakes Albinos</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>International Federal of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, November 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><big>Press Release</big></p>
<p>The killings of albino people in Burundi and Tanzania, based on occult practices, have triggered a crisis involving almost the entire albino population of the two countries, according to a report released today by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).</p>
<p>The report, called Through Albino Eyes, says that as many as 300 children and teenagers are now in hiding and stranded in Tanzanian schools for the disabled or in emergency shelters established by the police in Burundi, where they exist in dire conditions.</p>
<p>Thousands more albinos across a huge swathe of countryside  &mdash;  perhaps as many as 10,000  &mdash;  are unable to move freely to trade, study or cultivate fields for fear of albino hunters in search of body parts and hired mainly by witch doctors and big-money traders.</p>
<p>In the words of one local Red Cross worker, albinos are &#8220;hiding in their backyards&#8221;, their lives on hold.</p>
<p>The Tanzania Red Cross Society (TRCS) intends to provide health education about skin care, protective wide-brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts and vocational teaching equipment that will improve chances of finding indoor employment.</p>
<p>Salif Keita, the Malian albino singer and human rights activist said that &#8220;even before the killings began two years ago, albino people in tropical Africa suffered an array of afflictions that made physical survival a desperate struggle&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;These included, above all, needlessly high rates of fatal skin cancer that are the result of their acute sensitivity to sunlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>IFRC Secretary General Bekele Geleta described albinism as &#8220;one of the most unfortunate vulnerabilities, that needs to be addressed immediately at the international level&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our national societies closest to this tragic story have responded well, and they will continue focusing on areas where they can really add value  &mdash;  like public-health education and anti-discrimination awareness raising.&#8221;</p>
<p>The local humanitarian response to the albino emergency last year was largely coordinated by branches of the Red Cross societies in both countries, but urgently needs external support, according to the IFRC&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>Peter Mlebusi, the TRCS deputy secretary-general, said the crisis is now essentially fourfold: &#8220;It is a health problem because of the skin cancer risk. It is a stigma and discrimination problem in the community. There is also insecurity because of the &#8216;mythology&rsquo; of the wealth that can be generated by selling parts of albino bodies. And, finally, there is a legal issue because of the painfully slow process involved in dealing with the killings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once these people are identified by our volunteers an expanded Red Cross program will make a huge difference to their lives,&#8221; adds Dr. Mohammed.</p>
<p>Most recently, on 21 October, while IFRC was conducting the field research for its report, a ten year old albino boy, Gasper Elikana, was killed by hunters. His neighbours and his father had tried bravely but unsuccessfully to protect him.</p>
<p>The secretary general the Burundi Red Cross, Anselme Katyunguruza, emphasized that his organization was &#8220;committed to work with the authorities in our country to put an end to these killings and secure a life of dignity for our albino brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official death toll now stands at 44 albinos killed in Tanzania and 12 in the eastern Burundian provinces of Cankuzo, Kirundo, Muyinga and Ruyigi  &mdash;  on or near the border with Tanzania. Private organizations and some media in Tanzania have put the number higher, at more than 50 deaths.</p>
<p>In Burundi, to an even greater extent than in Tanzania, the total albino population is an unknown quantity, but the best estimate according to the local Red Cross is that there are at least 1,000 albinos countrywide.</p>
<p>The number of officially registered albinos in Tanzania is just under 7,000, but again some groups and media put the number much higher, and this total includes only people who have come forward voluntarily to register.</p>

		<p>I note that an advocate for albino blacks says they suffer high rates of skin cancer due to direct exposure to sunlight.</p>
<p>And here I thought solar power was blessed as the &#8220;next big thing&#8221;. I thought that &#8220;going green&#8221;, was going to be challenging for Third World peoples, but I didn&rsquo;t know how challenging.</p>
<p>These albino blacks clearly do not belong in countries who are going to use solar power as a lynchpin for meeting their energy needs.</p>

		<p>I have had skin cancer.  I am a white guy.  I guess skin cancer is part of whats called &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;.  If the blacks want cancer, they are welcome to it.</p>

		<p>Since mid-2007, children have been kidnapped and murdered in Uganda in what are believed to be bizarre rituals to attain wealth. In Tanzania, the killing of albinos whose body parts are reportedly used to make charms has caused global consternation.  And last month, Amnesty International found out that up to 1,000 suspected witches in The Gambia had been kidnapped from their villages by witchdoctors employed by the government in a nationwide witch-hunting campaign. But even when witchcraft is not making the headlines, it is still a daily issue in Africa. The practitioners and their victims believe in powers that simply do not exist. Sometimes belief in the dark arts is attributed to mass poverty and state failure to &#8216;modernize&rsquo; the outlook especially of people living in the rural areas. It is argued that if people were better educated and had access to adequate healthcare they would understand that illness is caused by germs and not witchcraft.  But these explanations miss the biggest point. They fail to place witchcraft within the persistent African worldview. Belief in witchcraft is part and parcel of the moral universe as understood in African Traditional Religion. Contrary to popular belief, African Religion is still alive and well. &#8220;In the African mentality, everything wrong or bad in society and in the world, and most particularly various afflictions, originates in witchcraft. There is no kind of illness or hardship at all that may not ultimately be attributed to witchcraft&#8221;.  Belief in witchcraft shall therefore persist as long as African Traditional Religion exerts influence on Africans.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t even educate our own U.S. blacks to that level of enlightenment, how could we possibly expect to succeed in black Africa?</p>

		<p>Muti or juju they call it, determined where you are in Africa. The age-old ways never die. Albinos as a group, even among whites, generally have a very short life expectancy, regardless of where they live. Just persons with an affliction no fault of their own that is only an outward manifestation of something else very wrong as well. And in Africa, an albino in the hot and very strong sun with the powerful UV radiation is at a very distinct disadvantage, much worse than normal.</p>
<p>What is the mental process - - anyhow - - that makes one think that the body parts of albinos are valuable as amulets for black magic?</p>
<p>Le Var Burton the actor wrote a novel years ago now where the plot was based upon UV radiation becoming so strong that white folks could not go out of the house. Black folks were being killed, their skin transplanted onto white persons! Le Var never imagined that something like what was in his novel would actually occur, but in AFRICA.</p>
