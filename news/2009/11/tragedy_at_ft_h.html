			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allen West, Red County, November 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This past Thursday 13 American Soldiers were killed and another 30 wounded at a horrific mass shooting at US Army installation, Ft Hood Texas. As I watched in horror and then anger I recalled my two years of final service in the Army as a Battalion Commander at Ft Hood, 2002-2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A military installation, whether it is Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, or Coast Guard, is supposed to be a safe sanctuary for our Warriors and their families. It is intended to provide a home whereby our &#8220;Band of Brothers and Sisters&#8221; can find solace and bond beyond just the foxhole but as family units.</p>
<p>A military installation is supposed to be a place where our Warriors train for war, to serve and protect our Nation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 5 November 2009 Ft Hood became a part of the battlefield in the war against Islamic totalitarianism and state sponsored terrorism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have become so politically correct that our media is more concerned about the stress of the shooter, Major Nidal Malik Hasan. {snip}</p>
<p>This is not a &#8220;man caused disaster&#8221;. It is what it is, an Islamic jihadist attack.</p>
<p>We have seen this before in 2003 when a SGT Hasan of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) threw hand grenades and opened fire into his Commanding Officer&rsquo;s tent in Kuwait. We have seen the foiled attempt of Albanian Muslims who sought to attack Ft Dix, NJ. Recently we saw a young convert to Islam named Carlos Bledsoe travel to Yemen, receive terrorist training, and return to gun down two US Soldiers at a Little Rock, Arkansas Army recruiting station. We thwarted another Islamic terrorist plot in North Carolina which had US Marine Corps Base, Quantico as a target.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What we see are recalcitrant leaders who are refusing to confront the issue, Islamic terrorist infiltration into America, and possibly further into our Armed Services. Instead we have a multiculturalism and diversity syndrome on steroids.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, what we have is a typical liberal approach to find a victim, not the 13 and 30 Soldiers and Civilian, but rather the poor shooter. A shooter who we are told was a great American, who loved the Army and serving his Nation and the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) stating that his actions had nothing to do with religious belief.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No one in leadership seems willing to sound the alarm for the American people; they are therefore complicit in any future attacks. Our Congress should suspend the insidious action to vote on a preposterous and unconstitutional healthcare bill and resolve the issue of &#8220;protecting the American people&#8221;.</p>
<p>The recent incidents in Dearborn Michigan, Boston Massachusetts, Dallas Texas, and Chicago Illinois should bear witness to the fact that we have an Islamic terrorism issue in America. And don&rsquo;t have CAIR call me and try to issue a vanilla press statement; they are an illegitimate terrorist associated organization which should be disbanded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We must recognize that there is an urgent need to separate the theo-political radical Islamic ideology out of our American society. We must begin to demand surveillance of suspected Imams and mosques that are spreading hate and preaching the overthrow of our Constitutional Republic&hellip;&hellip;that speech is not protected under First Amendment, it is sedition and if done by an American treason.</p>
<p>There should not be some 30 Islamic terrorist training camps in America that has nothing to do with First Amendment, Freedom of Religion. The Saudis are not our friends and any American political figure who believes such is delusional.</p>
<p>When tolerance becomes a one way street it certainly leads to cultural suicide. We are on that street. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ft Hood suffered an Islamic jihadist attack, stop the denial, and realize a simple point.</p>

		<p>Another question in my mind, which I keep finding contradictory answers for:  Who started the no guns on military bases (hello, Sherlock, they&rsquo;re the ARMED Forces), and why?  </p>
<p>As to who, I hear either Carter or Clinton.  As for why, it&rsquo;s this supposed paranoia about suicide.  What&rsquo;s disturbing but not surprising is that no matter which one it it was, it means that either one or three Republican Presidents let the policy stand.</p>

		<p>Ours is a reactionary society, where political correctness wins. To be proactive would be to cease the PC mindset, which this feel good, therapeutic minded nation cannot allow as it means party over to alot of unwanted bad behavior and relativism. Our culture continues to suffer.</p>

		<p>Stop all Muslim immigration into the USA, immediately. Muslims have over 40 Islamic nations from which to choose from.  There is no need for them to be in the USA.  We gain virtually nothing by their presence, but suffer greatly by importing hundreds of thousands of them.</p>
<p>Islam is a primitive, all-consuming, controlling religion that is totally incompatible with modern liberal Western societies. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re living in a delusion. Both that America is white, and that merely saying so, or saying &#8216;whites first&rsquo; will make it happen. Aren&rsquo;t they saying that around 50% of children born today are non-white? What will it be in 40 years, 80%? If by &#8216;America is white&rsquo; you mean several states in the Northwest, eventually, then you might have a glimmer of hope.</p>

		<p>I was in the army from late 1968 to late 1970. Stationed at Ft. Meade Maryland for 16 months. Only on duty MP&rsquo;s and DO&rsquo;s (duty officers) which made night inspections of arms rooms and other secrity concerns were allowed to carry arms. All other arms were locked in the arms room.</p>

<p>Good article; not just sensible but, for someone seeking office, pretty strongly worded and unapologetic. </p>
<p>I may have finally found a black candidate I could actually vote for. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Flamethrower&#8221; Are you being facetious? America hasn&rsquo;t been &#8220;White&#8221; for decades now! Indeed, America is now approaching 40% non-white population levels! We may not like, or even despise this fact&hellip;but it is still a fact, nonetheless!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m against immigration.  A look at my comments over the last several years confirms that I&rsquo;m against immigration.  But my definition of white probably differs from some others who write here.  I&rsquo;m a pragmatist.  Keep the foreigners out but understand that the definition of white is anything from many peoples in North Africa all the way to Sweden.  And some East Asians are pretty &#8220;white&#8221; too.  Bottom line, my greatest fear is the IQ issue.  Africans are non-functional due to their low IQs.  There is little we can do to change that.  That is why we must absolutely promote their abortions.  Their children mean welfare that enslaves us and adds to the criminalized society and lowers the nations IQ and that means a lower standard of living.  </p>
