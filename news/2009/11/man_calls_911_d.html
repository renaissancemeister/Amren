<h1>Man Calls 911, Doesn&rsquo;t Know His Address</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WJXT-TV (Jacksonville, Florida), November 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Von Powell, 22, who lives near Gainesville, had a hard time doing both of those things after he said he was the victim of a home robbery.</p>
<p>The man also told police that one of the things stolen was his &#8220;personal stash&#8221; of marijuana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He let the responding deputies know that he was sitting on the couch drinking a beer, watching a movie and smoking a blunt,&#8221; a deputy said.</p>
<p>Alachua County deputies were called out early Tuesday morning to Powell&rsquo;s home. Powell told the 911 dispatcher that two men had burst through his door and robbed him at gunpoint.</p>
<p>The problem was he waited nearly an hour to call police. He also had no idea where he lived.</p>
<p>Police eventually found Powell by driving around his Green Leaf neighborhood.</p>
<p>Investigators said when officers arrived, Powell said the robbers had made off with $800 and a bag of Powell&rsquo;s marijuana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said Powell was not arrested for possession of marijuana because there was a lack of physical evidence. After all, his stash was reportedly stolen.</p>
<p>Police said that Powell has been arrested on drug charges in the past.</p>

		<p>Von Powell must be the head lecturer for Attorney Legrand H. Clegg II,  producer of the award winning videotape &ldquo;When Black Men Ruled the World&rdquo;, see the AR article on 10/20/09.</p>

		<p>Seriously Mr. Powell, it&rsquo;s past time to put away the blunt and beer. Do try to salvage any remaining brain cells that may be left. Really.</p>

		<p>Wow!  Von Powell must really be an idiot.  He obviously does not know that even having marijuana on one&rsquo;s person can incur a felony prison sentence, or he would never have reported to the police about about his stolen stash!</p>

		<p>Now I know what&rsquo;s wrong with ME!  I followed your hyperlink to &#8216;Urban Law 101&rsquo;, and saw my nightmare vision of myself, over and over.  I grew up surrounded by Black help, and now understand why I find it so vexing that I have to relay telephone numbers, addresses, people&rsquo;s ages&hellip;.  Such things were foreign to the blacks who raised me, and so they are foreign to me.</p>
<p>I manage to relay the correct information with reasonable promptness.  But it&rsquo;s distressing to do so, and unnatural for me to do so.  And keeping appointments is such a problem that I have recurring nightmares about it.  I manage to show up pretty much on time (we&rsquo;re talking minutes, not hours), but it&rsquo;s done at huge psychic cost.</p>
<p>And I have to constantly run reality checks, to be sure I&rsquo;m not spinning wild fantasy tales like that poor Attorney&rsquo;s clients did.  I tell the truth, but don&rsquo;t trust myself to do so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered how much more competent and successful I might have been, if I&rsquo;d been raised by my own White relatives, or a Swedish Au Pair.</p>
