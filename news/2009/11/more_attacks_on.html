<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ginger24-2009nov24,0,2895018.story">More Attacks on Redheads Reported at Calabasas School</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Winton, Los Angeles Times, November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least three youngsters in Calabasas have fallen victim to violence by fellow middle-school students after a Facebook group urged people to beat up redheads, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The first reported incident occurred Friday morning when a 12-year-old redheaded boy was kicked and hit by a dozen of his classmates at A.E. Wright Middle School, Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s investigators said.</p>
<p>Detectives took reports of two more assaults, targeting a seventh-grader and an eighth-grader that day at the middle school, said Lt. Scott Chew. Investigators are trying to determine whether there was a fourth attack, officials said.</p>
<p>The students who participated in the attack may have been motivated by a Facebook message telling them that Friday was &#8220;Kick a Ginger Day,&#8221; according to Chew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ginger&#8221; is a label given to people with red hair, freckles and fair skin.</p>
<p>Chew said investigators believe the bizarre attacks were inspired by the television show &#8220;South Park.&#8221; A satirical 2005 episode focused on prejudice against &#8220;gingers&#8221; after one of the characters claims that people with red hair, light skin and freckles have no souls and suffer from a disease called &#8220;Gingervitis.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I find this appalling. I&rsquo;m a redhead myself, and one of my grown daughters is a redhead. It is true, while growing up I didn&rsquo;t like being one of the rare redheads in the community, and cared even less for old ladies always commenting on  my &#8220;beautiful red hair&#8221;. But as I  approached adulthood, I learned to appreciate it and the admiring glances it brought me from more than little old ladies, LOL. Brilliant red hair, blue eyes and fair skin, with or without freckles is becoming more and more rare as time goes on, I&rsquo;m not sure why, unless it is caused by the gradual darkening of the general population of this country. <br>
I understand the general concept of the &#8220;South Park&#8221; episode, which if taken to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion could have been used as another tool to teach the &#8220;evils of racism&#8221;, but has instead been used to become another tool used against people who are most definately, unmistakably, WHITE. Does anyone know the  color of the assailants of the redheaded children in California? I&rsquo;m taking bets they weren&rsquo;t white.  </p>

		<p>I guess Hawaii&rsquo;s &#8220;Kill a Haole Day&#8221; is now washing up on the shores of California.</p>
<p>I recall hearing radio talk show host Michael Savage stating that one reason he left Hawaii was because one of his children has red hair, and that would have subjected him to much teasing and abuse from the local non-white population.</p>
<p>Aloha!</p>

		<p>My question is, why are parents allowing junior high age kids, who have absolutely no ability to discern right from wrong (since the parents haven&rsquo;t taught them) - to watch &#8220;South Park&#8221; in the first place???  This is due to parental laziness and stupidity, pure and simple.  Only undisciplined and untrained students of that age could possibly &#8220;decide&#8221; that &#8220;South Park&#8221; presents an appropriate example to follow.  &#8220;South Park&#8221; is for adults, who are able to discern satire from reality.  In my time, junior high kids who did garbage like this got whacked, literally, by the vice principal, who was an ex-linebacker on the Detroit Lions.  He had a paddle with a hole in it, and would trade swats with the kids - &#8220;You hit me as hard as you can, because I&rsquo;m going to hit you as hard as I can.&#8221;  The kids inevitable went flying across the room, crying, and never repeated their offense.  Not a word was ever heard from any whiney parents, either.  But these little idiots need to receive the maximum punishment that the law can dole out   &mdash;   and in a just world, their parents would receive the swats.</p>

		<p>This is apparently a problem that is not limited to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2009/09/01/gingerism_newly_problematic.aspx</p>
<p>For the record: I watched a few episodes of South Park several years ago, thought to myself: &#8220;This is retarded!&#8221; and never watched it again.</p>
<p>Ahhh, the power of the boob tube to manipulate the hearts and minds(?) of the Great Unwashed.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, &#8220;gingerism&#8221; is an ancient problem.</p>

<p>As for male redheads?  I sympathize (though I&rsquo;m not a redhead).  Knowing how cruel kids can be to those who look &#8220;different&#8221;, if I had a redheaded child, esp. a boy, he&rsquo;d learn the martial arts.</p>

		<p>Calabasas is an exclusive suburb of Los Angeles in the western part of the San Fernando Valley.  It&rsquo;s mostly white, but a significant part of that white population is Jewish and/or  Persian.  There is also a growing number of Hindus.  In other words, Anglo-Saxons or Celts are NOT the majority.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t think race was the big issue.  I have married 2 red heads, one grew up in A small town Iowa, never even saw a black person in person until he was 18, and the other grew up in a very white suburb in Southern California and they were teased their entire childhood.  My mother got her red hair from her Jewish father and my stepsisters children are half African and they have red hair, freckles and pale hazel greenish eyes. I grew up around a lot of mixed race people - black and white - and a lot of them had red headed kids.  There are also a lot of redheads in the middle east (Arabs) and Aborigines with some white blood often have red hair. It is a pretty sturdy gene, so I don&rsquo;t think you all need to worry about it being bred out - more than likely it&rsquo;s being bred in. <br>
People with red hair have a history of being paid attentions to, at times in history it was revered and at other times red hair was thought to be the sign of being overly sensual- that is if you were a woman. And other time as a sign of weakness and fragility. Kids can be mean and they can pick on others because they have glasses, braces, have a limp, are a difference race, religion - heck I was picked on because one of my eyes wont turn to the right.  The thing is, children should be taught not to be mean and that starts with the parents, not some silly show. </p>

		<p>If your kid is attacked, and assaulted in whatever manner, find out who posted those comments on FaceBook, then sue in civil court the parents for willful misconduct of their minor children. Just the persons posting are subject to civil law suit, for helping to ESTABLISH A CLIMATE OF HATE!!</p>

		<p>I am going to go out on a limb here, but I support South Park! </p>
<p>If you watch the actual episode (it is available streaming on Netflix season 9) it is obviously about grievance mongering and minority empowerment gone amok, as the oppressed &#8220;gingers&#8221; form a support group which eventually takes things too far as they attempt to boil all the non gingers in hot lava.</p>
<p>South park  &mdash;  despite the crude bathroom humor  &mdash;  really genuinely does deal with a lot of taboo subjects in a humorous way. IF you want to see what I mean look up the &#8220;Minorities in my water park&#8221; song on Youtube. Sure they tend to end the episodes with some PC messege, but they push a lot of buttons.</p>

		<p>I think &#8220;Mike NY&#8221; is on to something.  This sounds like a variation on standard anti-White racism.  Notice how similar the syntax of &#8220;Kick a Ginger Day&#8221; is to &#8220;Kill a Haole Day&#8221;?  Including the alliteration in both phrases?  The new motto was produced by people from the same cultural matrix as the creators of the old one.  Combine this with the fact that there are a lot of Pacific Islanders living in the LA area and it&rsquo;s a safe bet that the attackers were from that region. </p>
<p>No doubt the bovine masses of DGI Whites will forget these incidents as soon as the lamestream media drops the story but it could just as easily have been &#8220;Kill a White Day&#8221;.  Eventually it will be, if we don&rsquo;t wake up&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have to ask,  who came up with this idea?  Who invented it? Notions like this don&rsquo;t just drop from out of the sky. Somebody came up with this idea and is promoting it.  We need to identify the perpetrator.  If anyone should be charged with a race-hate crime, THAT person is the one!</p>
<p>Incidentally, redheads are already a small minority, so they are the easiest ones to start on.  Will blonds, and then  all other whites be next?  In a century or two (or maybe less)  the New Majority may be hunting whites and collecting tropies like they are presently doing with albinos in Africa. </p>

<p>The thing is, in their world this isn&rsquo;t anti-white racism, it&rsquo;s anti-racism. In the official version of events, whites, and only whites, can be racists. And racism is ever present, in the past, in the here and now, and in the foreseeable future. And the worst, most vile thing in history is racism. And again, only whites are racists. Everyone else is being empowered to fight racism. And always, the only ones capable of offering a counterbalance to the script, an alternative way of looking at things. . they&rsquo;re always &#8216;nazi&rsquo;s&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>Hey, Guys,</p>
<p>I live not far from Calabasas and I don&rsquo;t think this story is a good fit for Amren.  Calabasas is an upscale, privileged, and very, very, white area.  That doesn&rsquo;t forgive the behavior of these students, but this story certainly doesn&rsquo;t have a racial subtext.</p>
<p>Now if the headline read &#8220;teacher attempts to hire student to kill other student,&#8221; or &#8220;architecture professor punches other professor in the face,&#8221; or &#8220;baby thrown in cooking grease,&#8221; or &#8220;gang of [anything] does [something bad],&#8221; then you might be on to something.</p>

<p>This really seems to be setting up a real stretch aimed at impuning non-white Christians.  The truth is that lots of white Christian kids bully and are influenced by bad computer games and South Park.  When I was growing up, the bullies I dealt with were white.</p>
<p>Jewish is a religion, not a race.  I have known a number of redheaded Jews.  Moreover, European Jews - Ashkenazis, are the last likely to bully or attack any kid of any race or religion.  My experience is that Jewish Mothers raise their kids with tolerance because of their own well-known persecutions.</p>
<p>And before I am accused of being a Jewish Well-Poisoner, I will declare here that I am of French-Norman and English Norman ancestry and have blue eyes.</p>
<p>The point to take from these attacks on &#8220;Gingers&#8221; is that even white kids can be taught to hate other whites by the media and by liberal politics.  South Park ties to be a PC teaching format for young adults, but simpler minded youths pften just see the &#8220;Jackass&#8221; element in the show.</p>

The writers of South Park were trying to show how unfounded prejudice can be absurd.</p>
<p>What they ended up proving is that regardless of how much sermonizing you do, people will always take away their own lesson.</p>
<p>This just goes to show that indoctrination programs for tolerance and multiculturalism are self-defeating and dangerous.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a redhead, as is my mother and all my siblings (both sisters).  This kind of thing would happen in the absence of any non-whites, and I went through a bit of it myself in childhood.  Of course, by puberty and afterward, we redheads are regarded as exotic and attractive, although the females more so than the males.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have known a number of redheaded Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what?  Blonds and redheads are found among all Caucasoid populations (in varying degrees).  By the way, redheads are mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible (see Genesis: 25:25).  The relatively high frequency of blonds and redheads among (Ashkenazi) Jews is due to the fact those traits are sexually selective for that group (see above link).</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, European Jews - Ashkenazis, are the last likely to bully or attack any kid of any race or religion. My experience is that Jewish Mothers raise their kids with tolerance because of their own well-known persecutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could also be a factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt neither vex a stranger (lit. a foreigner), nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt&#8221;. - Exodus 22:21.</p>
<p>Religion can be a powerful motivator in some people; just as powerful as past experiences.</p>

		<p>Hey, Guys,</p>
<p>I live not far from Calabasas and I don&rsquo;t think this story is a good fit for Amren. Calabasas is an upscale, privileged, and very, very, white area. That doesn&rsquo;t forgive the behavior of these students, but this story certainly doesn&rsquo;t have a racial subtext.</p>
<p>Now if the headline read &ldquo;teacher attempts to hire student to kill other student,&rdquo; or &ldquo;architecture professor punches other professor in the face,&rdquo; or &ldquo;baby thrown in cooking grease,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gang of [anything] does [something bad],&rdquo; then you might be on to something.</p>
<p>Please, people, listen to #17.  THIS IS NOT A HATE CRIME!  Calabasas is an EXTREMELY PRIVLIDGED WHITE SUBURB.  I was born and raised in Los Angeles, this has ALWAYS been a white enclave.  When your fellow Am-Ren friends who ARE FROM LOS ANGELES tell you this IS NOT A RACIALY MOTIVATED INCIDENT, please, please, PLEASE listen.</p>
<p>I find this extremely disturbing.  It makes me wonder what else has been posted here where the facts weren&rsquo;t completely examined, and where &#8216;posts from the locals&rsquo; were disregarded.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say this; I doubt that there are few here that take a harder line against what America has become than me.  But, BUT, when we engage in such discussions, it is ESSENTIAL that we know all of the facts.  If we don&rsquo;t, we look foolish, every bit the knuckle dragging racists that the media portrays us to be.</p>
<p>Friends, ask yourselves this: why/how does Mr. Jared Taylor make us all look so good (and give us so much hope for a better tomorrow?) during his debates?  BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE FACTS!</p>

		<p>If red-headed students in Calabasas banded together and sought out Bantu students under a &#8220;Kick a Zulu Day&#8221;, you&rsquo;d better believe it would be considered a hate crime.</p>

<p>There is a Jewish race AND a Jewish religion.  Jews, Arabs, Orientals, and Amerinds are all Semites.</p>
<p>Interesting, though, how Japhethites (Caucasians) and Semites generally have light skin, while Hamites have dark skin.  And Ham&rsquo;s son was cursed by Noah.</p>

So what?    That&rsquo;s irrelevant. <br>
It&rsquo;s not who&rsquo;s doing it. It&rsquo;s who it&rsquo;s being done to.  And why.</p>

		<p>I have a feeling that eventually this will start happening to blonds too (since they&rsquo;re also very distinctive looking), as well as to redheads more widely. The only consolation I have is that a lot of Marxist, multicult Lefties that I&rsquo;ve seen and known in my time have light hair. They never seem to understand that eventually they&rsquo;re going to get theirs too.</p>

<p>&gt; If you read my posts on this subject, I often write this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interesting, though, how Japhethites (Caucasians) and Semites generally have light skin, while Hamites have dark skin. And Ham&rsquo;s son was cursed by Noah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet this is a Biblical story and has as much merit as a Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy tale.  The latest archeology in the Mideast has shown that the origin of the Jew&rsquo;s is likely that they WERE the Cannites and there was a revolt against their leadership.  Later, when they were captured and moved to Babylon, the leaders wrote the &#8220;Old Testament&#8221; stories in order to rally the people into a coherent group.  The current theory is that they were joined a a small group of Cananitte Proto-Jews who had either escaped or simply left Egypt.  There has never been any archeological evidence found to support any of the battles and even structures claimed, and they have been searched for more than just about anything else in the world.  The latest research in Egypt has shown that the pyramids were built by middle class citizens who seemed to donate time to the project as a religious observance, not unlike how Stonehenge is believed to have been built and some American religious groups like The Mormons practice.  It has even been found that the economics of supporting so many slave laborers would have been made the projects impossible and capitivity unlikely.</p>
<p>What is going on at Calabasas is that whites are being trained to attack other whites in a sort of mini-hate crime fashion.  The perps no doubt imagine that because the victims are white, nothing is racist about it, just good ol&rsquo; hazing type fun.  Very hurtful to the victims however.</p>
<p>It is also a good example of Machivelian tactics.  But religious disagreements tore Europe apart and had them killing one another over Christianity for nearly the entirety of the modern epic.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to really think things out?</p>

<p>&gt; I lived in Eastern Europe for some time and I can tell you that there are words for one of your own as well as words for strangers who are white but not your national/ethnic group.  But let&rsquo;s just take a local example; If you are white a Mexican will call you a &#8220;Gringo&#8221; even though you might both be Christian and even Catholic in the same church.</p>
<p>There is a big problem among American Christian whites understanding of their own European cultures that continues to lead to generalities and gross misunderstandings that are more harmful to whites in the long run than not.  And such resultant attitudes and positions make us look ignorant and harms our survival.</p>
<p>Moreover, a &#8220;Christian Gentleman&#8221; would recognize the long, intricate history of Europe&rsquo;s dependence on Jewish Gentlemen.  Muslim&rsquo;s sought to conquer and put to the sword, all disbelievers.  Jews brought trade, knowledge and assistance to Europe and its rulers from Roman times through to at least the 19th century.  In the Middle Ages (example) Montepelier had Europe&rsquo;s only medical school and it was founded and staffed mostly by Jews.  Even today, a large number of the top scientists and medical researhcers are Jews and their work continues to save many white, Christian lives.<br>

<p>That does not surprise me re Pyramids.  4th Dynasty Old Kingdom Egypt didn&rsquo;t have the military might or military manpower to enslave other people outside of Egypt.  Its population was only about 5 million.  It would have been just as ludicrous as the Missouri National Guard trying to conquer and garrison California and bringing back some Californians as slave labor to build pyramids.  Therefore, the Pyramids had to have been built with domestic labor.</p>
