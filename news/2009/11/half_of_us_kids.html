<h1>Half of U.S. Kids Eventually Must Use Food Stamps</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lindsey Tanner, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), Nov. 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly half of all children in the United States and 90 percent of Black youngsters will be on food stamps at some point during childhood, and fallout from the current recession could push those numbers even higher, researchers say.</p>
<p>The estimate comes from an analysis of 30 years of national data, and it bolsters other recent evidence on the pervasiveness of youngsters at economic risk. It suggests that almost everyone knows a family that has received food stamps or will in the future, said lead author Mark Rank, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The analysis was released Monday in the November issue of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. The authors say it&rsquo;s a medical issue pediatricians need to be aware of because children on food stamps are at risk for malnutrition and other ills linked with poverty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Food stamps are a Department of Agriculture program for low-income individuals and families, covering most foods except prepared hot foods or alcohol. For a family of four to be eligible, its annual take-home pay cannot exceed about $22,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rank and Cornell University sociologist Thomas Hirschl studied data from a nationally representative survey of 4,800 American households interviewed annually from 1968 through 1997 by the University of Michigan. About 18,000 adults and children were involved.</p>
<p>Overall, about 49 percent of all children were on food stamps at some point by age 20, the analysis found. That includes 90 percent of Black children and 37 percent of White children. The analysis didn&rsquo;t include other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The analysis is in line with other recent research suggesting that more than 40 percent of U.S. children will live in poverty or near-poverty by age 17 and that half will live at some point in a single-parent family. Other researchers have estimated that slightly more than half of adults will use food stamps at some point by age 65.<br>

		<p> The &#8220;real danger sign,&#8221; to paraphrase one of the learned sachems quoted here, is that untold numbers of Americans have learned how to &#8220;game&#8221; the poverty system   &mdash;   how to get the taxpayers to pay them to be poor.</p>
<p> Ninety percent of black children on food stamps? That is not an &#8220;indictment&#8221; of the American system; it&rsquo;s an indictment of the black community, in which fatherless families and welfare mommas have become a way of life. When signing up for welfare becomes a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221; for people reaching a certain age, that bodes extremely ill for our society. To increasing numbers of Americans, and not only blacks by any means, the motto has become, &#8220;Why work when you can draw a welfare check?&#8221; (or &#8220;get on disability.&#8221;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to know the percentage of people on food stamps that are obese.  I&rsquo;d wager that&rsquo;s a hefty figure as well. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that most American children will use foodstamps, because most children born in America are now nonWhite.</p>
<p>Blacks have an illegitimacy rate of around 80%. Most kids born to single mothers are born onto welfare. So right off the bat the vast majority of Blacks are getting welfare at our expense. Hispanics are not that much better.</p>

		<p>40% of children on FS?  40% of US children have parents who will not support them.  We are very close to the tipping point where tax consumers out number tax payers.  If you count welfare, FS, SSI and medicaid recipients as well as government employees who knows, we may be past the tipping point.</p>

<p>If you thought a newspaper based in Phoenix, Arizona, home to a large, hispanic underclass, would be concerned with the percentage of hispanics on food stamps, you&rsquo;d be wrong.  In the media ONLY blacks and Whites are to be compared.</p>
<p>Let me help out the Arizona Republic with a few facts:</p>
<p>Fifty percent of Hispanic households use some form of welfare, the highest rate of any major population group.</p>
<p>The Hispanic illegitimacy rate is 43 percent, twice the white rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;d like to know the percentage of families on food stamps that have a cell phone, or a flat-screen TV, or a satellite dish&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wager nearly all of them.  I pass a prison-like housing project each day that has a satellite dish on the roof of nearly every unit. </p>
<p>In Los Angeles, capital of the Third World, I&rsquo;ve read estimates that 40% of the local economy is cash-based.   The hispanic underclass collects wages in cash, pays few taxes, and receives an entire panoply of free services from the government  &mdash;   housing, food, education, babysitting and medical care.</p>
<p>Cash that isn&rsquo;t needed for basic living or medical expenses can be spent on big-ticket items such as plasma screen TVs, the latest gaming system, the newest cell phones, satellite dishes and cable services, cars (that they don&rsquo;t register or insure), tattoos, expensive &#8216;kicks&rsquo; and bling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder they vote as a bloc for race-based politicians who tell them they&rsquo;re victims and promise more government services.</p>
<p>But as Margaret Thatcher famously warned:</p>
<p> &#8220;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&rsquo;s money.&#8221; </p>
<p>In California, it&rsquo;s already happened.</p>

		<p>Rather than the indicator of poverty the media have been hyping this new statistic as, this is simply an indication of how many Hispanics we really have in this country, and of what a large proportion of the youth they comprise. </p>

		<p>Wayne and Randolph you have it exactly right.   I left California, the welfare state for illegals, only to come to North Carolina and find I landed in the welfare,.. uh, excuse me, &#8220;disability&#8221; state.   So many cheats here, and yes, fat, with gym memberships and flat screen TV&rsquo;s,.. they don&rsquo;t go without anything!   They are lazy and illiterate.  What I have found happens is that they work until they have some little mishap and because MOST of them QUIT school, they are uneducated and can&rsquo;t find work except in manual labor.   I mentioned this to one guy on welfare,.. uh sorry,.. disability,. I asked him if his body was unable to do physical labor, why didn&rsquo;t he find a job that didn&rsquo;t need his body.  He told me that he could not read.  I offered to teach him and his reply was &#8220;no thank you&#8221;.  And this guy has been on disability for a while and he is ONLY in his 40&rsquo;s.  And yes, he does work &#8220;under the table&#8221;.  The fatty I mentioned above, he is only in his early 30&rsquo;s, that one is &#8220;bi-polar&#8221;, but he has an idle woodworking shop.</p>
<p>These people are pathetic!   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m on foodstamps right now after having had an accident, and developing other health problems after the operation and hospital stay.  I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about how &#8220;inadequate&#8221; food stamps are, and how malnourished people are if they are on food stamps.  Lots of people on food stamps get full food stamp benefits to pay for three meals a day for each child, even though the children are getting free breakfast and lunch at school EVEN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.</p>
<p>A lot of people on foodstamps are shopping at little grocery stores in their neighborhood that allow them to game the system by giving them 50 cents on the dollar of foodstamps to buy cigarettes, liquor, lottery tickets, etc.  If these people&rsquo;s kids are going hungry, it is NOT the taxpayers&rsquo; fault.  If you give out higher levels of benefits, it will result in a lot of additional fraud, at least in certain neighborhoods. </p>
<p>You can do OK on food stamps even if you are just a so-so cook and eat quite a lot of convenience food.  (I&rsquo;m single, and my kids are grown, so I often just eat a 99 cent frozen meal for the microwave.)  If you live in a normal area with Kroger&rsquo;s, etc., and try to buy what is on sale each week, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem.  I&rsquo;m at least 60 pounds overweight now that I can&rsquo;t walk much anymore.  If the moment your food stamp allotment comes in you run off to store and buy expensive chocolates and lobster, then you will have a huge problem by the end of the month.  At that point, I guess you drive down to the local food pantry and waddle up to the counter to tell the volunteers that your babies is howngreeee &#8216;cause the food stamps done run out.</p>
<p>I will say that the first month or two that I was on food stamps (after moving to an absolutely empty apartment from the hospital) that I didn&rsquo;t have enough money to purchase much in the way of condiments, spices, etc., but after a few months, I had the normal amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; in my pantry that I had had when I was working.   If I were to change anything about the food stamp system, the only thing that I might change would be giving people a little extra the first month if they are setting up a household from scratch (previous home gutted by fire, etc.).  </p>
<p>I have NEVER even been tempted to ask for any help from the church or from a food pantry or soup kitchen.  I am deeply suspicious of claims that vast numbers of Americans are going hungry on a regular basis.</p>

		<p>As someone who is not from the US I find the food stamp program to be quite interesting. I had to look it up to find out what it&rsquo;s all about. I must admit I&rsquo;m a little shocked to see that 35 million people used it in June this year (2009) and can only be given to people with near-poverty incomes.</p>
<p>My first question was &#8220;Does this imply that the US has more than 10% of the population on the poverty line?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little bit of digging I see that &#8220;13 to 17% [are] living below the federal poverty line at any given point in time, and roughly 40% falling below the poverty line at some point within a 10 year time span.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a First World country these statistics are Third World. I will defer to Wayne Engle&rsquo;s comment about the right of passage to welfare.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Why work when you can draw a welfare check?&rdquo; (or &ldquo;get on disability.&rdquo;)&#8221;</p>
<p>So true and when it comes to &#8220;disability&#8221; I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of White americans gaming the system. Funny thing, 90% of the people I&rsquo;ve seen on &#8220;disability&#8221; are in better shape than most people and have no problem with their 5 senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to know the percentage of families on food stamps that have a cell phone, or a flat-screen TV, or a satellite dish. I&rsquo;d wager the numbers are quite high, particularly in depressed urban areas. I&rsquo;d also like to know the percentage of people on food stamps that are obese&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wager 95%. I see all these &#8220;welfare&#8221; types. They ALWAYS manage to get their beer and cigarettes and most of the women have buttocks the size of california!!!!</p>

		<p>At least most Asian immigrants and most Asian-Americans do not apply for food stamps and welfare.  In any major city, the &#8220;Chinatown&#8221; section of any major city is clean and safe for white people to visit and patronise its resturuants and shops.  Not so in the black section of any major city!</p>
<p>Asian immigrants and Asian-American communities have a work ethic that is unhreard of in the black community.  It is my understanding that most Asians would consider it dishonorable to be a lazy, welfare and food stamp recepient.</p>
<p>A century ago, and further back in time, communities of Italian, Irish, German, Jewish, Polish, and other immigrants pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps on their own, at a time was there were no food stamp and welfare programs.</p>
<p>There are also poor whites and Hispanics who for generations are also lazy welfare and food stamp recepients, and yet, as Randolph Carter points out, have cell phones, flat-screen TVs, and satellite dishes.  These whites and Hispanics are also irresponsible with having many babies out of wedlock, just like in the black community. </p>

		<p>If half the kids under five are non-White, it would make sense that half the kids in the country will receive some kind of welfare.  Yes, I know that there are soldiers&rsquo; families getting food stamps and college students, and useless White idlers too, but the bulk of it come from the fact that our Rulers have imported enormous numbers of aliens that feed off of our society.  Don&rsquo;t doubt that Orientals and Hindus take the free money too.</p>

		<p>I unfortunately had to &#8220;get on disability&#8221; about 5 years ago. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. I felt terrible for having to mooch from fellow taxpayers. But I did pay the insurance premiums the government took from my checks all the years I worked. I also worked a lot of years from a wheel chair doing all I could to stay at work. But after the third round of being paralyzed from the waist down and the resultant surgeries I was glad of the social program that allowed me to survive. So I&rsquo;m a bit torn on the issues of social services. But I do know one thing, if I had the choice between digging a ditch for minimum wage or drawing from the fed and spending my days drinking 40&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d gladly dig that ditch if able.</p>

		<p>Grew up in the 70&rsquo;s in a 4 children family.  Mother worked part time jobs around the schedule and requirements of us kids.  Father did not make much money.  He was not educated, and could never seem to break into a higher paying job.  We qualified for assistance, but my parents would never, ever apply for them  We never had food stamps or participated in the free (or dicounted) school lunch programs.  No government assistance, ever.  My parents firmly believed that you took care of your own.  Period.  We never went hungery.  My mother was a great cook.  and could make a meal out of most anything.  Have to admit though, by the time I was 13 I had only eaten out maybe 3 or 4 times.  Just no money for things like that.  All of us kids now have post high school educations, and succesfull healthy families.  So long as you have your health, a good work ethic and decent morals is all one really needs to stay OFF government assistance.  I see this first hand, and have little if any empathy towards those I see constantly see using their  goverment Access cards (welfare here in PA)at the store.  The things I see them buy would turn my mothers stomach!</p>

<p>Unfortunately some of the largest banks and financial systems in the United States aren&rsquo;t of the same mind.  The problem with America isn&rsquo;t the impoverished inner city resident or illegal immigrant that collects a few thousand view some form of welfare it&rsquo;s the large banks/financial institutions that have collected hundreds of billions from government handouts.  </p>
<p>We live in a handout nation if it&rsquo;s not someone down the street collecting food stamps it&rsquo;s GM or Citibank.  The liabilities that the US government has guaranteed for exceed welfare payments.  </p>
<p>Nowadays if you get a handout the only question isn&rsquo;t whether you should get one or how big.  Apply for a few thousand dollars worth welfare people call you a leech, apply for a 40-50 billion dollars worth then people call you too big to fail, an important part of the economy, a good corporate citizen.  <br>

		<p>The St. Louis City Public Schools is going to raffle off iPods to students whose parents sign them up for free or reduced school lunch, i.e. they were income eligible for it, but have not yet signed up.  I suppose free food isn&rsquo;t its own best reward anymore.  Imagine all the extra food that could have been bought with the money that was used to buy the iCabal&rsquo;s portable music players.</p>
