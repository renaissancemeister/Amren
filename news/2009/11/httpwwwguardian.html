<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/ireland-pay-immigrants-go-home">Irish Government to Pay Immigrants to Go Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry McDonald, Guardian (Manchester), November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ireland is offering money to immigrants to leave the recession-crippled Republic. The Irish Department of Justice has confirmed that it is opening an EU-funded project to persuade foreign workers and asylum seekers to return to their country of origin.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman told the Observer this weekend that the scheme will only apply to non-EU nationals living in the Republic and would involve the department spending almost €600,000 this year to pay for immigrants and their families to return to nations outside the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grants will not be given to individuals but rather the scheme will operate through projects and organisations,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They [immigrants] can apply for the fund only through organisations and community groups. It is the first time we have introduced the scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The department has made it clear it had no projected figure in mind as to the number of immigrants the government hopes will take up the repatriation grants.</p>
<p>Advertisements promoting the scheme were published in Irish national newspapers on Friday. Application forms will also be available for non-EU nationals in the main immigration centre on Burgh Quay, Dublin.</p>
<p>The voluntary repatriation programme comes at a time of rising fears about the cost of immigration into Ireland.</p>
<p>Last week the mayor of Limerick caused a political storm when he called for the deportation of EU nationals who were out of work for more than three months and were claiming social welfare benefits.</p>
<p>Kevin Kiely said: &#8220;We are borrowing €400 million per week to maintain our own residents and we can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the good times it was grand, but we can&rsquo;t afford the current situation unless the EU is willing to step in and pay for non-nationals.&#8221;</p>
<p>However the mayor was forced to withdraw his remarks after a storm of protests. His own party, Fine Gael, distanced itself from his comments.</p>
<p>In a subsequent statement, Kiely said: &#8220;I still am of the opinion and so are others, who have approached me in recent days, that there is abuse of the Irish social welfare system.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in seeking to highlight this I inadvertently caused offence to others, which I very much regret.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the latter years of the Celtic Tiger boom Ireland underwent a demographic revolution in terms of its ethnic make-up. Up until the early 1990s Ireland was 95% white and Catholic.</p>
<p>However, according to the Republic&rsquo;s central statistics office, about 18% of Ireland&rsquo;s inhabitants are now non-nationals.</p>
<p>Most of them are from eastern Europe, China, Brazil and west Africa or are British citizens who have settled on the island.</p>
<p>Some academics, such as Dr Bryan Fanning of University College Dublin, estimate that the real figure is more than 20%, meaning Ireland&rsquo;s &#8220;foreign&#8221; citizens make up over one fifth of the Republic&rsquo;s entire population.</p>
<p>The majority of the immigrants who arrived during the boom years were enticed to Ireland to fill vacancies in the construction, retail and tourist sectors  &mdash;  the main parts of the Irish economy to be severely hit by the current recession.<br/>

<p>This statement is only partially true.  The international elite and their Irish political lapdogs wanted to open the third-world floodgates.  The vast majority of Irish (Bono excepted) were vehemently opposed.   </p>

		<p>Would you PAY someone that broke into your home and lived there at your expense to leave? This policy will ENCOURAGE even more immigration because they now know that, at the very least, they will go home with a fat check.</p>

<p>What perverse times we live in!  When a Western society is successful, it is punished by having its native population replaced by foreigners.  In more sane times, the success of a nation like Ireland would be equated with the success of the People of Ireland and those people would reap the rewards: higher standards of living and being able to have more children of their own.</p>
<p>It is now the case that the best safeguard of one&rsquo;s genetic heritage is poverty. </p>

		<p>Makes you wonder why they didn&rsquo;t think to pay the Irish to leave Ireland during the potato famine. </p>
<p>I have learned that if a stray dog comes to your house and you feed it then it&rsquo;s much harder to get it to leave. There could be a connection as to why it&rsquo;s so hard to get rid of unwanted immigrants. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Ireland is having much trouble with Slavic immigrants, but  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s face it  &mdash;  Europe as a whole is in the midst of a crime wave wrought by Pakistanis, Moslem Arabs, and blacks from Africa and the Caribbean (and Brazil in this case?)  I thought the old countries had melted under the heat of PC and multiculturalism, so I&rsquo;m glad to see some are not just whining but are taking direct action and sending them back!  <br/>
Give them travel money and put them right on the boats!</p>

<p>the easiest solution to the third world immigration problem is of course to not let them in to begin with. why the white nations of the earth don&rsquo;t think this is an option is beyond me.</p>

 &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if Ireland is having much trouble with Slavic immigrants, but &mdash;  &#8220;</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reluctant to say this, and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to give offense to any Slavic persons, but I&rsquo;m inclined to be against the idea (of Slavic immigration, or <i> any  </i>other). </p>
<p>Why?  Not for any objection to the Slavs themselves, but because it softens up the Irish (or any nation, for that matter ) to  <i>further </i> immigration.  The Slavs are just the first foot in the door, and the most acceptable one. But who will be next?    If you allow the Slavs to come in, then you will be accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t allow the Pakistanis too.  And if the Pakistanis, then why not the Nigerians?   Where do you stop?</p>
<p>I would say that you stop right at the beginning. That is, if you don&rsquo;t start, then you don&rsquo;t have to stop.  The ancient European nations have distinct characters which I would like to see preserved. (Of course, the EU wants the opposite   &mdash;   to eradicate all national differences.) I would like to see Poland remain Polish and Ireland remain Irish. There is also the glaring hypocrisy in the fact that the Irish fought for so long to get  the English out,  claiming that Ireland should be for the Irish (a reasonable claim); and now having accomplished that, they turn around and invite everyone else in!  It makes one question their sincerity, or at least their logic.</p>
<p>Another point, seen from the opposite end,  is that when you drain, let&rsquo;s say,  a hundred thousand Poles out of Poland, then you open up a hundred thousand places for third world  &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to fill there.  When (and if) those Poles eventually return home, they&rsquo;ll find they have some new neighbors they hadn&rsquo;t expected!   Their old neighborhood may be gone.</p>
<p>Except for students, tourists, businessmen, it&rsquo;s best to stay at home among your own people and culture.  Casual travelers are one thing, but immigrants  and settlers are quite another.  There will always be some migration, of course, but large-scale migration is another thing, and that&rsquo;s what I speak of.  I wonder how the Poles would feel to have a million Irishmen, or  Finns, or Greeks, or Americans,  dumped upon them.  I suspect they wouldn&rsquo;t be too pleased. Nobody would.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, &#8220;high fences make good neighbors&#8221;.  And it&rsquo;s true.</p>

		<p>   This seems like a practical and humane solution when combined with further restrictions on future immigration. I whole-heartedly support this approach. Ireland is a small country of only a few million so why did it need immigration in the first place?</p>

<p>They did not &#8220;invite&#8221; anyone in. </p>
<p>Immigration started after they joined the EU. The EU demanded that Ireland take in immigrants even though the general public do not want them. This is true for the majority of EU countires when it comes to immigration.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Thank you, Conan.  I stand corrected.  I&rsquo;m sure you are right. What I really meant by &#8220;they&#8221;  was the politicians, the ones who control these things, some of whom have been mentioned here from time to time.  They seem to be enthusiastic  for it&hellip; that is if they know where their bread is buttered!</p>
<p>It seems that in Europe, just as in the US, it&rsquo;s the politicians against the people.  What a bizarre situation!</p>
