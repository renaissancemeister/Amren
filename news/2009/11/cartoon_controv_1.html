<h1>Cartoon Controversy Continues</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nora Caplan-Bricker, Yale Daily News, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sixteen organizations will accuse Yale today of failing to stand up for free speech with its decision not to print satirical images of the prophet Muhammad in a book published by Yale University Press last September.</p>
<p>The organizations, which include the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and the International Publishers Association, appear as signatories on a statement that will be sent to Yale, chastising the University for not printing Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard&rsquo;s controversial cartoons. The statement, written by National Coalition against Censorship Executive Director Joan Bertin, argues that by capitulating to threats of violence, Yale has fed a climate in which people will be afraid to speak and publish freely. Yale&rsquo;s decision drew widespread criticism and debate from professors, students and alumni in the past three months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The statement is the latest development in a controversy that began last August, when the Press announced it would print Brandeis University professor Jytte Klausen&rsquo;s book, &#8220;The Cartoons that Shook the World,&#8221; without the cartoons that incited violent riots when they were first published in a Danish newspaper in 2005.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although some of the signatories of Bertin&rsquo;s statement have expressed skepticism that reprinting the cartoons in a scholarly book would actually cause bloodshed, Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer said two weeks ago that there is evidence the cartoons are still inflammatory. She pointed to an October incident in Chicago, in which two men were arrested for plotting to kill Flemming Rose, an editor of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which printed the cartoons in 2005.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s statement, which Bertin co-authored with Cary Nelson, president of the American Association of University Professors, appeared in print earlier this fall. Bertin and Nelson gave Duke University professor Gary Hull, another signatory, permission to use their statement in his book &#8220;Muhammad: The &#8216;Banned&rsquo; Images,&#8221; released two weeks ago. The book reprints the images stripped from Klausen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view and the view of the other signatories, what Yale did was really cowardly,&#8221; Hull said earlier this month. &#8220;There are a lot of smart people at Yale. They should know that for them to cave to what I regard as barbarian behavior leads to nothing but emboldening barbarism and a further erosion of free speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement already had more than a dozen signatories  &mdash;  among them Rose, University of California, Los Angeles law professor and first amendment expert Eugene Volokh and Sarah Ruden, a professor at the Yale Divinity School  &mdash;  when Hull published it in his book. {snip}</p>

		<p>Would these people criticize a newspaper for refusing to print satirical images of other minority groups, or only Muslims?  Let&rsquo;s get real, Muslims are low down on the list of minority groups that are destroying America right now.  Anyone who wants to focus on Muslims but won&rsquo;t speak against other larger minority groups is probably some kind of neocon who does not have white America&rsquo;s best interests at heart.  </p>

<p>Like everything else in this country the universities continue their slide to eventual implosion, especially the so-called ivy league ones.</p>
<p>Funding has been drying up now for two years now, and it is predicted to reach critical levels throughout academia soon.</p>
<p>When they get to the point where they&rsquo;re going to either have to drop nonsense subjects like black and women&rsquo;s studies or start robbing banks, I&rsquo;m wondering what they&rsquo;ll use for disguises.</p>

		<p> Yale&rsquo;s cave-in is typical of the weak-kneed attitude of university administrators in general. There are groups of people on this planet   &mdash;   Muslims and blacks come immediately to mind   &mdash;   who need to learn some self-control and &#8220;getting over it.&#8221; This world is not constituted solely to cater to their prejudices and avoid bruising their &#8220;tender&#8221; feelings.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to flush out Muslim extremists and terrorists than by publishing cartoons of Mohammed and making them very public.</p>
<p>This is a simple test of freedom of the press and expression.  If Muslims can&rsquo;t stand it, they are simply in the wrong country or countries.  If they wish to eliminate it from the entire world, we want to know this and have it stated clearly.</p>
<p>Mohammed is a child molester and sheep shagger.</p>

		<p>The organization FIRE (Freedom of Individual Rights in Education) rates Yale with a yellow light defined as:  &#8216;Institutions with at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>Sexual harassment includes the<br>
following: </p>
<p>• Unwelcome sexual comments<br>
• Remarks about an individual&rsquo;s body or<br>
appearance<br>
 • Unspoken sexual innuendo such as voice<br>
inflection when complimenting appearance<br>
or gazing at parts of the body other<br>
than the face.</p>
<p>How does one determine harassment via &#8216;unspoken innuendos such as voice inflection&rsquo; or &#8216;gazing at parts of the body other than the face?&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Here is Yale&rsquo;s policy concerning &#8216;Freedom of Expression&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly demonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yfmge6z" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yfmge6z</a></p>
<p>And this is not the first time Yale has feared &#8216;offending&rsquo; muslims:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Campus administrators reversed course on their removal of a sign, which read &#8220;Kill &#8216;em all, Let God sort &#8216;em out,&#8221; after some officials believed it to be offensive to Muslims and South Asians. One counselor noted that while he believed in free speech, the banner could be hostile to ethnic minorities&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/ykzl5xr" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ykzl5xr</a></p>
<p>Orwell would be quite proud that his prophetic political writings such as 1984 are coming to fruition, i.e. Free Speech is only Free Speech when the masters say it is.  Orwell noted:  &#8216;Political language was designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yale and and the government (by passing Hate Speech laws) are busy stuffing Free Speech down the memory hole.</p>
<p>You can bet the following organizations:  American Civil Liberties Union, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and the International Publishers Association would neither protest nor &#8216;chastise&rsquo; Yale were any type of offensive speech or action directed at Whites.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really surprised to learn of some of the organizations that have blasted Yale. We&rsquo;ll have to see what happens now that Duke&rsquo;s Prof. Hull&rsquo;s book is in print. Why should we cower in fear of Muslims?  Yale is, perhaps unwittingly (even though its scholars are among the world&rsquo;s most enlightened), making a statement about Islam.  We Christians have seen our most sacred symbols almost literally p***ed upon, and we don&rsquo;t go out to kill and riot and burn thousands of cars.  For some time now, I&rsquo;ve wondered if Muslims might have some deep-seated car burning compulsion.  It must be a real blight to the neighborhood to see all those burned-out automobiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they shall beat their ploughshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Amazing!</p>
<p>There is a point of some interest to be made. The cartoons can be found on the &#8216;net - via Wikipedia, among others - in two minutes; anyone with an internet link can find them. [Even here in Saudi Arabia!]</p>
<p>However, there are countries in which some totally uninvolved shop assistant in a bookstore could have acid thrown in her face by an incensed fanatic. This is why Mahatma Gandhi did NOT appear on the Beatles&rsquo; &#8216;Seargeant Pepper&rsquo; album cover.</p>

		<p>SKIP is in error. There was some vandalism in Al-Khobar, KSA, on the national day. A number of the perpetrators were publicly whipped but none were beheaded.</p>

<p>Even a broken watch is right twice a day. Better that than never at all. And BTW, while muslims may not be the most pressing problem in the states right now, a quick look at Europe will show how easily they could become so.</p>

<p>Love the Orwell quote. Also appropriate:</p>
<p>&#8220;If freedom means anything, it is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised.  Ivy League schools produce some of the most radical of leftists and exhibit the greatest level of cowardice found at any university level.  Bowing down and cowering before the Muslims   &mdash;   I can&rsquo;t think of anything more disgusting for an American to do.  We need to get in their face, with force, and not allow them to perform ANY further acts of terror or even threat of terror.  And I like the descriptions of Muslims and Allah kindly provided by a couple of readers here!</p>

		<p> If it seems the ACLU is coming down more often on the side of right, it is probably because of the heat they&rsquo;ve had to take big time for the first time in their history . If I were you, I still would not trust them any further than I could pick them up and throw them . They are die-hard liberals and their agenda is to change the America that we grew up in, into something you would never recognize . </p>

		<p>Apparently the argument has moved from the insensitivity that someone somewhere on this planet may become offended, to claims that the cartoons could potentially maybe spark violence.  Even if peach in the form of cartoons does inflame fanatics, isn&rsquo;t the First amendment, the foundation and fundamental right to our way of life, worth some sacrifice?  </p>

<p>And the ACLU chimes in, on the side of &#8220;the right&#8221;. Or so people think. Fat chance. It&rsquo;s PC to hate arabs, Muslims. Just as it is PC to hate Whites, especially White males. This is posturing by the ACLU and the academics listed above. You can bet not one of them would defend Whites or Western Civilization, unless there was some ulterior motive to benefit the Marxists and their neocon cousins. </p>

		<p>The poster who wrote entry #16 beat me to it. The academics listed are a bunch of anti-white hacks. They&rsquo;re simply coming to the aid of their Marxist and Neocon cohorts. Same thing for the ACLU and the other organizations pretending to be on the side of right, pretending to have a backbone when they are simply being Politically Correct.</p>
