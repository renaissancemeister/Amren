<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After community activists pleaded earlier for a day without killing, violence erupted throughout the city after the stroke of midnight on Saturday, leaving at least two people dead and several injured.</p>
<p>At about 12:06 a.m., Frederick Evans, 20, of the 6800 block of South Ada Street was found shot to death in an alley in the 500 block of West 58th Street. He was shot in his back and chest.</p>
<p>Witnesses told police Evans was involved in a dice game shortly before midnight, {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minutes after Evans&rsquo; shooting, a 32-year-old man was shot at about 12:13 a.m. on Chicago&rsquo;s West Side in the Lawndale neighborhood.  Police said he was shot after he watched a fight in the 3900 block of West Ogden Avenue. {snip}</p>
<p>At about 2 a.m., Howard Hodges, of Park Forest, was shot and struck by a car near a lounge in the Chatham neighborhood. Hodges, 34, was pronounced dead on the scene.</p>
<p>Another man also was shot in front of the lounge located in the 8300 block of South Vincennes Avenue, but he was taken to St. Bernard Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. {snip}</p>
<p>Later, two other people were stabbed in the Englewood neighborhood at about 3:15 a.m. in the 6600 block of South Carpenter Street, and three people were shot in the Brighton Park neighborhood at about 5 a.m. near 47th Street and Homan Avenue, police said.</p>

		<p>This story about Chicago, sounds amazingly similar to the situation in Detroit, Washington, DC, and East St. Louis, as well as in Nigeria, Haiti, the Congo, and South Africa.  However, this sort of thing is very rare in Stockholm, Shanghai, Tokyo,  Portland, OR, and Madison, Wisconson.  </p>
<p>Why throughout the world do some cities experience extreme violence, whereas other cities do not?  What is it specifically that makes a city dangerous, and prone to crime?</p>

		<p>They cannot change their genetics. Why bother trying to plead with them or suggest anything that they will never comprehend to begin with? How long have Whites been trying to change black behavior and thinking? For hundreds of years now and they are getting worse not better. A divorce is in order to finally separate Whites and blacks forever. </p>

		<p>&#8220;You need guys out on those hot corners, talking to the young men,&#8221; who are most likely to be involved in shootings, Hardiman said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What good would it do?  The problem lies within the genetic make up of blacks, nothing else. No amount of talking or midnight basketball programs are going to change it.</p>
<p>And giving each of them a million dollars as Obama would like to do, stupidly thinking that the problem is poverty, wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>
<p>The only way to handle black crime and violence is to put blacks in their own territory, away from everyone but white liberals.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Wright, Jesse and Al, plus most white liberals, would have everyone believe that so many black males are criminals, because the system is against them.  </p>
<p>How was it old Jeremiah termed it?  &#8220;They&rsquo;ve been treated outrageously!&#8221;  Yes, it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s fault but their own, isn&rsquo;t it, Jeremiah?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that black males, in general, do not have the mental capacity or ability to compete in this society or any other outside of Africa.</p>
<p>Pretending they can&rsquo;t get ahead because of whitey, only incites them to further violence, because the ones that are the worst are just too stupid to understand that.</p>
<p>This country will continue to deteriorate to third world levels, and will eventually degenerate into a banana republic in just a few short years, because of black incompetents who resort to violence and because of the ever growing mestizo population.</p>
<p>I would venture to say that, if we do not erupt into warfare within the next ten to fifteen years, the national I.Q. average will drop from 98 to about 89, the same as the failed state of Mexico.<br/>

		<p>The amazing thing to me is that I find this story only on Amren!<br/>
This is an important story. I will be reading my local paper to see if this is mentioned. I am not shocked anymore to see that the mainstream media exist to suppress the news rather than to broadcast the news. <br/>
I read some of the comments made on the original Chicago news site. The posters sound like they would find themselves quite at home here on Amren!</p>

		<p>As a lifetime Chicago area (SW suburbs)resident, I can tell you that this and the following events represent a typical weekend.</p>
<p>At some point there will be yet another march by &#8220;concerned community members&#8221; (several of which will wear clerical collars)after which the local news lackeys will interview person after person who&rsquo;ll decry the murders of &#8220;our babies&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in a newspaper a few days later, the victim in his late teens will be described as 1) having turned his life around (that means that he was in trouble already), 2) being good at making other people laugh (apparently he tried to make one too many people laugh), 3) paying a lot of attention to his two children (without benefit of marriage), and 4) hoped to make the honor roll (didn&rsquo;t we all HOPE?).  </p>
<p>Oh yes, nearly every dead male will be described as wanting to play in the NBA.</p>
<p>This series of events will happen next weekend and the next and&hellip;. </p>

		<p>I have some questions for the &#8220;community activists&#8221; who wanted a &#8220;day without killing,&#8221; or, as some of them might say, a one-day truce.</p>
<p>If you have the power to stop Chicago&rsquo;s blacks from murdering each other for one day, why not extend it for more than one day?  Why not ask for &#8220;two days without killing,&#8221; or better yet, 2000 days without killing.  Just go all in and make it forever without killing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you had the power to stop Chicago&rsquo;s blacks from murdering each other, which we will assume that you had if your &#8220;day without murder&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t have any murders, then should you, as &#8220;community activists,&#8221; be charged as accessories to every murder in Chi that took place because you didn&rsquo;t call for a truce?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that power.  It&rsquo;s just a good public relations line that the stupid media buy hook line and sinker.</p>
<p>The other big reason why they&rsquo;re whistling Dixie is because a &#8220;truce&#8221; only applies to a real shooting war.  Black gang (and other) violence can&rsquo;t be brought to a truce because it&rsquo;s not a real war.  Do you think that when Gangsta&rsquo; Disciple shoots Crip on a given Chicago street corner that it&rsquo;s the same as the French and Germans tossing grenaydes and shooting canons at each other across the Maginot Line?  None of the murders listed in this article is the same as real warfare.</p>
<p>What it really is is an occupational hazard.  Black drug gangs are nothing more than territorial protection and turf staking for the dealing of illicit substances.  It&rsquo;s illegal, illicit and immoral, but it&rsquo;s still a job.  And when someone crosses over to the wrong side of the road looking to swing a deal, then it&rsquo;s time to shoot.  For these community activists to ask black gang bangers not to shoot each other is asking them not to make a living.  Another reason why the call for a truce is stupid.</p>

These rallies are pointless. They&rsquo;re just preaching to the choir. We get the same thing all summer long in Buffalo. Murder after murder and another &#8216;stop the violence&rsquo; coalition springs up.</p>
<p>What they need, but don&rsquo;t have the stomach for, is good old fashioned bust-some-heads police intervention. </p>
<p>These people would rather have dead black kids than black kids with a bloody nose.</p>
<p>They wanted their &#8216;freedom&rsquo;. Now they&rsquo;re free to kill each other.<br/>

		<p>It has been 44 years since the declaring the&#8221; War on Poverty&#8221; by LBJ and Ted Kennedy and many Billions of dollars later and where is the End Game? Forty-four years, that is two generations and still no end in sight. The Liberals and Ghetto Apologists insist progress is being made but only if Whitey were doing more, this problem of race in America could be solved. Perhaps it is true. But me and my friends, have never broken windows in the Ghetto,mugged anyone in the Ghetto,bought or sold drugs in the ghetto, but still we are some how responible. The Liberals are still playing the blame game. When will they stop pointing fingers but simply look in the mirror to see the cause of this failure to take responsibility.</p>

		<p>Same old same old.  Just like South Buffalo native said, there&rsquo;s always violence, then some other silly, meaningless march.  I&rsquo;m tired and disgusted with the nonstop and continuing pathology of blacks, also.  I know one person alone can&rsquo;t do much, but I try to refer as many other whites to your site as possible. Keep up the good work.  Of course where I live, the media did&rsquo;nt report this either.</p>

		<p>These types of stories are also very common around the LA area-only with hispanics instead of blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks are irredeemable due to their genetic make-up and inability to live in a culture created by Whites.  They resort to violence first and foremost for the smallest  slight and nothing will change this  &mdash;  and all Whites had better get this message soon, the hispanics in LA well know the nature of blacks and use deadly force to ethnically cleanse them from hispanic areas.</p>
<p>I heard a police officer from the gang detail speak at a teachers&rsquo; meeting a while ago.  He said the main problem when dealing with hispanic violence is the permanent grudges they hold against each other, some going back several generations.  Every time a gang truce is proposed or pro-offered, the gangs reject it because of ongoing scores that &#8216;need to be settled&rsquo;  &mdash;  scores that must be settled with blood so the cycle of violence is endless.  If a truce is forced, it lasts about as long as it takes the ink to dry on a document none of them can even read-they too have little to no understanding of truces, cease-fires or treaties, that is for us Whites whom they consider weak.</p>
<p>Of course, the media rarely condemn these gangs and instead focus on police brutality  &mdash;  brutality needed to deal with feral, heavily-armed, non-White gang members  &mdash;  calling for &#8216;task forces&rsquo; to be formed or &#8216;gang out-reach&rsquo; programs to be started in all the schools or more oversight of the police department, none of which has done a bit of good and sucks up untold fake obama dollars.  </p>
<p>Never is there a call for the government to stop importing gang members wholesale from mexico and central america, a call to seal the border, a call to use the military or national guards to rid our streets of violent illegal immigrant gangs that prey on American citizens, or a warning to protect yourself with deadly force if need be.  </p>
<p>It has gotten so bad that mexican drug cartels have set up illegal businesses in America&rsquo;s National Parks, destroying pristine environments, while the Sierra Club looks the other way and wrings its hands over the environmental impact of the border fence.</p>
<p>No, only more calls to disarm citizens making them more helpless by the hypocritical senator feinstein, who herself has a gun permit.  </p>
<p>Integration does not work and there is plenty of evidence that it doesn&rsquo;t work  &mdash;  in the schools, neighborhoods, in the workplace.  </p>
<p>All the proof needed is to look at the racial make-up of neighborhoods where government officials live and that of the schools their precious children attend.  This needs to be repeated endlessly, brought to light and asked of them constantly.</p>

		<p>I live in Illinois, and I can tell you this.  Corruption rules Chicago.  You simply cannot advance politically in Chicago unless you &#8220;play the game.&#8221;  The public should be immediately suspicious of ANY politician who comes out of Chicago.  Honest politicians quickly get washed away in the rough-&-tumble, you scratch my back and I&rsquo;ll scratch your back-world of Chicago-style politics.</p>

We&rsquo;ve tried throwing money at this segment of society,in effect &#8220;bribing&#8221; them to behave like humans,and it will JUST NEVER WORK. Due to an unfortunate {for everyone} confluence of both nature and nurture,these people can&rsquo;t stop being a violent,brainless danger to themselves and others&hellip;</p>

<p>I live near Portland, OR and I can tell you that violence is not uncommon there.  It may not be as bad as Chicago, but it has been increasing as more Hispanics and blacks arrive from the south.  Portland also had a huge gang problem in the &rsquo;80s and early 90s when the Bloods and Crips gangs set up operations there to sell dope to stupid, liberal, whites.  Those same stupid, liberal, whites now drive a seemingly unstoppable drive toward &#8220;Diversity&#8221; as city and state policy.  The same is true of Washington State, where I live.  </p>

		<p> Chicago used to be a great city, now look at it. Blacks and hispanics everywhere you look. The price you pay for being a great city is that every minority group under the sun wants to live there. You can usually gauge how great a city was by the number of minorities residing there.</p>

They are turning back the clock to where it was a thousand years ago. In the Middle Ages, noblemen were armed    &mdash;   that was one of the privileges of an aristocrat    &mdash;    while peasants were  forbidden the right to bear arms.  This is how they were kept helpless and  docile.   In fact, having a &#8220;coat of arms&#8221; was (and is) one of the indicators of noble birth.   Peasants didn&rsquo;t have coats of arms because they didn&rsquo;t have arms.  Eventually, freemen, yeomen, gained the right to have and bear arms&hellip;. the basic right to defend themselves.  This was one of the jealously guarded rights of freemen who settled in America, a right which distinguished them from serfs and peasants in Europe.  Now, &#8220;aristocrats&#8221;  such as Sen. Feinstein are trying to reduce the rest of us back to peasant status again   &mdash;   no longer freemen but cringing helpless serfs dependent on the mercy of our &#8220;betters&#8221;.</p>

Wow  &mdash;  Baltimore must have been fabulous at one time (I remember it being very nice in the 1950s&hellip;). Baltimore  &mdash;  where our black mayor Sheila Dixon has been in court about some gift cards for the poor that she allegedly got her hands on.</p>
<p>I remember block-busting in Chicago in the 1960s. My grandparents were driven out of their home by block-busting at the end of their lives, but at least they died of natural causes.</p>
