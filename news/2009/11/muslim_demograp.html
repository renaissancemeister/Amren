		<p>I am not moved by a Catholic Christian message inciting me to fight Islam in the name of Christianity.  Christians come in all colours and cultures besides white.  If anything, this video serves to undermine whites anyway, as many Africans, Hispanics, etc., are Christians too.</p>
<p>Rather, attemtion needs to be paid to preserving White culture in Europe that includes regions where Islam AND non-Whites are forbidden.  If such enclaves - RESERVATIONS - are not created soon, the relgion of the remainder will not matter much.</p>

		<p>If our decadent population was not so concerned about who will win the football games this weekend and took some time to be concerned about what is really going on in the world, they might be very concerned by this video. As it stands though, they will just flip the clicker to another game and go back to the beer they&rsquo;ve been drinking. </p>
<p>Our ruling class has done an excellent job of providing bread &amp; circuses and dumbing us down. Will they be happy when they&rsquo;re being forced to convert to islam and they have to make their women wear burkas? Hmmm???</p>

		<p>A very well produced video.  The most gnawing, hard to answer question about the Europeans is why did they allow significant Muslim immigration in the first place, and why when the trends became obvious (long before 2009) did they not stop the immigration?  Why do they not stop it now???  Why do they prosecute their own citizens who criticize it now???</p>
<p>This is curious because many Europeans I have encountered over the years still retain some nationalistic and ethnic pride, often directed against fellow Europeans!?!?  Yet, their leaders welcome with open arms invading hordes who openly proclaim their strategy of demographic warfare.</p>
<p>Besides some sleazy businessmen who want a cheap (not really) labor force, the only possible reason for this plan of large scale, third world immigration to both Europe and the United States is a long term infiltration of the far left into many institutions, both public and private, over the years.  Beware of &#8220;conservatives&#8221; who advocate, or tolerate mass third world immigration to the Western nations as they are either fools, or puppets of the far left as I believe G.W. Bush was.</p>
<p>The influence these people have must be enormous as the elites of virtually every institution, now including the leaders of the US Military, kowtow to the doctrines of the far left.  And the far left&rsquo;s weapon of choice is demographic / social warfare (of various types), just reference the linked article below.  This strategy was written long ago, and its implementation in the current world is both blatant and omnipresent.</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/misc/091116_raehn.htm</p>
<p>So where does this leave us??  Considering the power of the far left is so strong and imbedded in existing states the only alternative is the formation of third parties, the creation of break-away states, or outright revolution.  The formation of nationalist, third parties is now occurring in both Europe and United States, and they will face persecution and prosecution from the far left institutions.  It will be an ugly fight.</p>

		<p>Gentleman, there are several factors involved here that I would like to list.  1. Post-modern feminism that has sought to destroy the nuclear family and told women that career is much more satisfying than family.  2. PC indoctrination that uses guilt and psychological coercion to make European/North American peoples go along with immigration. 3. A speed of light decline in moral values of our young people reinforced by mass media and academia.</p>
<p>The fact is that Europe and the U.S. currently exhibit all the symptoms that Rome had prior to its fall. To be honest, I would rather see a global apocolypse than see the world fall under the shadow of the minaret. Better to die than be coerced into bowing down to the call of the Muezzin. My fellow AmRenners, we are the last Praetorians. <br>

		<p>This video is ludicrous. Lets take a look at correct statistics:</p>
<p>The highest fertility rate in the world is in Niger with 7.19. How on earth can Muslims have 8,1 children per family in Europe?</p>
<p>Average number of children in France by the country of origin:</p>
<p>All women living in metropolitan France - 1.74 	<br>
Women born in Metropolitan France - 1.70 	<br>
Immigrant women - 2.16 	<br>
Women born in overseas France - 1.86</p>
<p>And the country mentioned by incorrect illustration of Turkish flag scored only 1.87. The primary sending countries to France like Algeria and Tunisia score only 1.82 and 1.73 respectively.</p>

But for a small savvy group among them who surely have their own exit planned, the rest of them don&rsquo;t look that far ahead. They don&rsquo;t care. They don&rsquo;t see it as their problem. Do airheads like George Bush worry about the long term? They can&rsquo;t imagine the scenario you describe. If such a thing did come to pass, they would rely (as always) on their money and connections to buy themselves special favors and exemptions. </p>
<p>Just as with integration, school busing, affirmative action hiring, special quotas, and all the rest, these things are not seen as relevant to their lives and their kind.   They apply to the masses, but not to them.  So they think!</p>

<p>Since you have already admitted your not even Christian in a previous thread why don&rsquo;t you cut the song and dance routine and tell people what you really want?  I&rsquo;m betting it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s at odds with what the indigenous Europeans want.  The games and manipulation are getting old and very transparent.

		<p>This is an EXCELLENT video, and I would urge everyone to see it! <br>
Rather than get into a quibbling match with anyone over precise statistics and percentages, I&rsquo;ll just say that any person who has visited Europe lately can see with their own eyes the truth of its message for themselves.  And it gets truer and more apparent with each year that passes. <br>

		<p>I live in Germany</p>
<p>Most europeans DESPERATELY want an end to muslim immigration, but even if this were carried through, they can still take over europe via high birth rates.</p>
<p>Muslims in Europe are NOT cheap labor, there are basically wards of the state (even those who work received vastly more in services than they pay in taxes - how many pay enough tax to put 6-8 kids through school?? virtually ZERO).</p>
<p>The number of Muslims living in Germany has quadrupled - but the number of WORKING muslims has stayed the same.</p>
<p>If generous social programs were canceled, many would leave, and their birth rates here would plummet.</p>
<p>there are signs of people publicly breaking through the PC speech codes and stating such facts openly,</p>
<p>It is NOT too late for Europe, but it will be a struggle.</p>

		<p>The PROBLEM IS NOT low birth rates. THE PROBLEM IS IMMIGRATION. Japan has very low birth rates. Nobody is talking about a future muslim Japan. Historically Europe&rsquo;s population has been subjected to sudden and dramatic swings but always bounced back. The KEY was that only the INDIGENOUS population was resident on the continent. In the 1340&rsquo;s Europe lost a third of its ENTIRE population in just a few years because of the black plague. Wars and diseases had big but not permanent effects on Europe. So long as no outsiders are let in the population will only shrink but is UNCHANGED and can always bounce back in the future. </p>

		<p>Deniz is right. I think the video-makers are being rather sensationalistic.</p>
<p>However, we can&rsquo;t deny that back in the 1970s, when most of today&rsquo;s migrants were born, the Muslim world did have a birth rate of 6-7 children per woman, while Europe was down at 1.5. A similar case held true for the United States versus Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. As secularism started to take hold in the Muslim world and Central America, it brought the average down to about 2.5 at last count. In the United States and parts of Western Europe (Scandinavia and the British Isles), the white rate went back up toward 2.0.</p>
<p>In future, there will be much less differential between the white and nonwhite rates, which is in fact required if we want to ever take back our countries again. The Turks lost the Balkans last time by being outbred by their Christian neighbors. It can happen again.</p>

<p>I would hope that they would leave Europe itself, not just Germany. Otherwise, they will just move across the border into the next receptive state.   Same problem, new location.</p>
<p>But firmly detaching them from Europe&rsquo;s teat, and getting them to go back to a hut in North Africa is NOT going to be easy!</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s true. But it pretty much boils down to the same thing, more or less.<br>
Perhaps they object to Islam simply because they&rsquo;re being careful to avoid any appearance of racism   &mdash;   the 21st century&rsquo;s  most awful crime.   Under Marxism, you can still complain about religion   (although some religions are more sacred than others).   So it&rsquo;s a little easier to identify the invaders by religion, while any mention of  race is utterly taboo.</p>
<p>True, that not all Moslems are non-white, nor are they even non-European.   But most of the immigrants are. (Especially in places like France and Britain, not so much Germany/Switzerland.)  So the term serves its purpose.  It&rsquo;s a shame that we can&rsquo;t just discuss race openly and honestly.  But in today&rsquo;s Europe, post 1945,  that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>

		<p>WhitePlight, this was not a Catholic message.  The Catholic Church would never sanction anything like this   &mdash;   they are way too PC for such a thing.  (I know - when I do Christianity I am Catholic!)  This was put out by a conservative Protestant group, I don&rsquo;t know which one.  At any rate, they&rsquo;re right; hence, &#8220;those effing Muslims!!&#8221;  They will indeed take over by sheer birth rate in Europe, and they will do it here too if we don&rsquo;t do something about it.  I say that Islam is the Number One danger to the ENTIRE WORLD today, and people had better wake up to the fact.  Of course, &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; may well produce calamities in the near future that will make it unnecessary&hellip;. but a lot of people besides Muslims will suffer from it.</p>

		<p>Another aspect of this issue is that Europe&rsquo;s indigenes can expect no assistance from the United States once the wheels of political and cultural change start turning even faster. The Islamic Tendency that can be observed in B.H.Obama will prevent any interference; Platitudes like &#8220;lets let this peaceful transformation occur&hellip; &amp; what right does the US have to interfere in &#8216;majority&rsquo; opinion in Europe&#8221;&hellip;blah blah blah.</p>
<p>The dreadful truth is that even if by some awakening just one or two European countries decided to expel radicals, enforce human rights for indigenes or stop this agressive Islamic invasion/immigration, again the US under this BHO regime would do nothing to assist; Why would it? it&rsquo;s what they want. I can even forsee a scenario whereby if say the BNP or similar were elected to government that the USA would boycott that nation,impose sanctions or even worse.  Who would stop them?  New Zealand? Canada? Australia? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>This is why it is so vital to unelect the Obama regime; once USA has gone Marxist/Islamist there will be no nation strong enough or willing to prevent worldwide totalitarian.  The world will return to the rulers and the ruled as it was prior to the spread of American ideals.</p>

		<p>Poster #12 hit the nail on the head. In 50 years Japan will still be 98% Japanese. Instead of importing millions of ignorant foreigners to do cheap labor, they are moving their labor intensive industries abroad. This still makes one&rsquo;s country more vulnerable by making the economy more dependent on trade and the whims of foreign government&rsquo;s labor policies, but the culture (meaning the blood of the people) will remain. Europeans have no need for their immigrants, they could just as easily move their labor intensive industries to Asia&hellip; WHICH THEY&rsquo;RE DOING ANYWAYS! This begs the question WHY IMMIGRATION? It&rsquo;s more sinister than pure economic motivation. </p>

<p>You have a point. This video have been refuted many times, here and there. I don&rsquo;t give resources, the numbers in the video are simply unrealistic.<br>
France and Scandinavia (especially Iceland) have higher birthrates than Turkey or North Africa (except Morocco). </p>
<p>By the way, isn&rsquo;t Europe overpopulated, 700 mil people packed in the continent smaller than the United States? I&rsquo;d rather stop immigration than increasing birthrates.</p>

		<p>Want to change all this? Eliminate the welfare state. Half the muslims and immigrants would move back home if it wasn&rsquo;t for the freebies.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only part of the welfare state. The other part is social security, and medicare/medicaid (or the european equivalents). They take a giant bite out of your paycheck. It used to take one breadwinner to pay for a family, and now it takes two. We are actually going backwards, thanks to government growing like cancer, and the taxation/inflation that feeds it.</p>
<p>People used to have kids, partially so that someone would look after them when they grew old. Now of course, the welfare state has given everyone a (pitiful) retirement, so children are obsolete, in that sense. Similarly, the welfare state also made black fathers obsolete, so they have abandoned their families in frightening numbers since 1965.</p>
<p>The only thing that really gives me hope is my belief that welfare states all over the world are going to collapse. They are pyramid schemes, and that&rsquo;s what pyramid schemes do. There isn&rsquo;t enough money (or immigration) in the world to patch up the welfare states&rsquo; obligations to baby boomers, and they will collapse rather suddenly and unexpectedly, like the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>

		<p>Japan also leads the world in robot technology, proving that society-transforming immigrant labor for dirty, dangerous, dull work is unneeded. If Americans didn&rsquo;t use illegals to, for example, pick our crops, who&rsquo;s to say we couldn&rsquo;t find a better, perhaps even cheaper way, to do it?</p>

		<p>21 Rex Kramer:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think American and European welfare states will be eliminated, nor should they.  I think they&rsquo;ll be drastically reformed, best case scenario being that nationalist governments will not allow non-whites to go on welfare.</p>
<p>But the reason white countries have welfare states is because it&rsquo;s in the psyche of white people.  The first welfare state was started by the right-wing government of Otto von Bismarck, and both rightist and leftist parties support the existence of a welfare state, the only debate is a matter of how pervasive it should be.</p>
<p>As for:</p>
<p><i>It used to take one breadwinner to pay for a family, and now it takes two.</i></p>
<p>The main reason for that is because there&rsquo;s so much non-white mainly illegal alien cheap labor around.  Like I said here a few days ago, as Peter Brimelow pointed out, the irony of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s xenophilia is that AK is one of the last few places were only one breadwinner is needed to provide a very comfortable standard of living for a nuclear family, main reason being distance from Mexico.  Yet, she wants to convert AK into Mexico.  </p>
<p>Another reason for that historically is that America&rsquo;s corporate establishment latched onto feminism in the 1960s, not because they agreed with feminist principles, but because they wanted more people into the work force to lower the wages.  Fortuitously for them, this happened at a time when there was high inflation, so that means that a man who made the same dollar amount in 1970 that he did in 1960 didn&rsquo;t seem to be paid less, but thanks to inflation, he was.  And, income tax bracket rates weren&rsquo;t indexed to inflation (until 1985 or so), so that means he virtually paid less in taxes, even though it was the same dollar amount in 1970 that it was in 1960, only it meant less to governments in 1970 than in &#8216;60 b/c of inflation.</p>

France and Scandinavia may be experiencing birth booms,  but those are NOT babies of real Frenchmen of Scandinavians, but of the fast-reproducing immigrants who have invaded them.</p>

		<p>Wasp Insurgent: You are much to my liking. You are 100% correct:<br>
1) The women have failed us<br>
2) PC indoctrination is a new Stalinism - 1984 has long been here<br>
3) The youth have been corrupted and cast adrift with no values</p>
<p>Islam is a greater threat than the Soviets were during the Cold War. I frankly pity the poor souls who gave their blood, sweat and lives to &#8220;liberate&#8221; Europe from the Nazis. For what did they sacrifice? That Europe be put in the thrall of raw barbarism? All of us are thankful for the Greatest Generation and their sacrifice. But we must question if we are truly better off for it. The out of control liberalism and multi-culturalism of the Europeans is an imposed one. It is a direct response to the abuses and crimes and horrors of the Hitler regime and the 2nd World War. But is it perhaps an overreaction? Is there not still room for some national pride and the impulse to preserve one&rsquo;s people and nation? Diversity comes from uniqueness, not some blended cultural porridge. People should be free to practice Islam - in Islamic nations. When they come here - Germany, France, England, the USA - they are guests. In civilized nations we expect guests to act with respect and deference to the host. This is our culture, our nation. We will not change it for you.</p>
<p>I am sure the Germans and others are capable now of winnowing through the morass of their history and easily sorting out the good from the bad and moving on. They don&rsquo;t need hordes from the east to help them or PC laws. If their governments fail to provide them aid and support or obstructs the people from preserving their own nation and culture, that government must be removed.</p>
<p>The fact is that the governments of Europe, in particular the governmental structure of the EU itself, are in many ways still occupational governments bound to an increasingly distant past and the politics of that past. Vigorous Denazification has done little to quell genocide or ethnic cleansing. This no longer occurs in Europe, but elsewhere it is still part of the repertoire of some &#8220;culture.&#8221; Now the guilt associated with this past has become a tool of these governments to quash the natural impulse of citizens to preserve their national identity and culture, which includes racial characteristics. Anyone who expresses such an impulse is immediately labeled a &#8220;right-wing radical&#8221; or, worse, a Nazi. Up is now down, and black is now white.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what banner we march under, but march we should or prepare for our own destruction.<br>

		<p>As a Jew, and a non apologetic white nationalist, I will submit that one of the most tragic consequences (and least discussed) of the Nazi era in Germany, is the almost total shutdown of a sensible race discourse in the West. If you bring to the table once axiomatic truisms regarding human bio-diversity, and the differences in ability among various population groups, you are branded as a racist and ready to stoke up the death camps at a moments notice. This either or mentality, with no degree of nuance allowed and the social (and often economic) shaming of those who don&rsquo;t tow the PC line is causing incalculable damage to all Western Cultures.</p>

		<p>International banking interests are behind the EU and the concomitant rise in third world immigration. An increase in population counters the inflationary trends which would otherwise impoverish, but enlighten, the subject populations. Inflationary trends are caused by the central bank system which prints money and then lends it to governments at interest. Absorption of the phantom &#8220;money&#8221; produced by central banks happens rather effectively when the numbers of recipients of the &#8220;money&#8221; increase.<br>
The same banking interests are behind the immigration to the USA.<br>
What is interesting is the denoument of this. As Ludwig Von Mises (I think it was) said, &#8220;Rich nations cannot be made up of poor citizens.&#8221; Eventually the quality of a nation&rsquo;s human resources makes a dent. I predict long term, lasting poverty for the ethnocentrically cleansed EU nations and the USA. The immigrants being imported to soak up the inflation aren&rsquo;t up to the job of inhabiting and managing a 21st century landmass.<br>
Back we go.</p>
