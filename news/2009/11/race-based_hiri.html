<h1>Race-Based Hiring</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tali Arbel, Google News (scroll down), November 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Managers&rsquo; race has had a &#8220;significant&#8221; effect on the race of employees, according to a study of personnel data from a U.S. retailer over 30 months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study tracked about 100,000 employees at more than 700 stores belonging to one, unidentified chain from February 1996 to July 1998.</p>
<p>The report found that replacing an African-American manager with a white, Hispanic or Asian manager resulted in the hiring of fewer African-American employees. The percentage of new workers who were African-American under the non-black managers dropped to 17 percent. Under the previous African-American manager, newly hired employees had been 21 percent black.</p>
<p>The region and ethnic makeup of the community that a store was in affected hiring as well, the report found. For example, in the South, replacing an African-American manager with a non-black manager led to a bigger drop in the proportion of African-Americans among new employees than in the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in regions that were at least 30 percent Hispanic, the study said the proportion of new workers who were Hispanic dropped from 59 percent to 48 percent after a white manager took over from a Hispanic boss. The share of employees hired on who were white increased.</p>
<p>The reason behind the racial pattern in hiring was unclear, the authors said. {snip}</p>
<p>The study also found that white employees were more likely to quit their jobs if an African-American manager replaced a non-black manager.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Back in 1979, although I was a racially-conscious white, I was offered a position under a black manager at a Fortune 500 company.  Whew, did I make a mistake.  He was dreadful.  An arrogant, pompous, self-absorbed, anti-white bastard who was given free reign by his neutered white superiors.  I should have realized this was a glimpse into our future but I honestly believed things would change in the years ahead.  Well, we all know the ending to this story&hellip;<br>

		<p>In reply to 1.  The reason IS in fact unclear.  People tend to trust their own race more.  But certain races, blacks in particular, have traits that make it a good idea for one to actively distrust them.</p>
<p>What is unclear is if blacks aren&rsquo;t being hired because the managers prefer to hire employees of their own race or if those managers are simply experienced enough to know that hiring blacks is a very bad idea.</p>
<p>There are two issues here&hellip;.harmony in the workplace and differential ability.<br>

		<p>Of course the percentage of black and hispanic employees drops when a black or hispanic manager is replaced. The black and hispanics are stacking the deck with their own.</p>

		<p>To #1&hellip;LOL!! Wow, that&rsquo;s the best laugh I had all night.. </p>
<p>On a more serious note, as a former hiring manager myself for a major retail store, I would pick white people as well because they were more reliable and better workers. When I did hire a non white, it came from higher up, and was told to go through the motions. During these interviews, I learned not to use big words, and the most simple questions like &#8220;tell me a little about yourself&#8221; or &#8220;what are your plans for the future&#8221; seem to stump them. If they did manage to make it through the hiring process, they never lasted very long. All these things are NOT stereotyping, racism or what have you, these are FACTS, so call me what you will, I know what I have personally witnessed. </p>

		<p>This is one of the things that happens when Asians take over the IT department at a company.  Only other Asians, from that person&rsquo;s own ethnicity get hired, usually Indians or Chinese, once the boss becomes Asian.  </p>

		<p>All people communicate better with persons similar to themselves, similar in many aspects, race and gender being the biggest and most easily identifiable ways. Simply put, other African Americans can understand the Ebonics-speaking, ghetto-slang barking young black male far better than the middle-aged white manager can. And vice versa is true too, I&rsquo;m sure. <br>
Body language, pauses in speech, and various other intangibles are also semi-unconciously &#8220;read&#8221; and the impressions noted for hiring potential. When two persons with the same qualifications but different races are up for consideration, the one of the same race as the one doing the hiring is usually easier to &#8220;read&#8221; as to suitability for the job opening. (BTW, women are usually FAR better at this than most men, and most personnel managers should be women for this reason.)</p>

		<p>Asians have taken over many government jobs in San Francisco. DMV used to be mostly black (and you can imagine the quality of the service). Now it is overwhelmingly Asian: more efficient, but stone-faced service and difficult-to-understand English. </p>
<p>You never see a white bus driver in San Francisco; I can&rsquo;t believe they don&rsquo;t apply, especially in this economy. Whites still outnumber Asians in the City, but they don&rsquo;t seem to get the government jobs. </p>
<p>There is a department at City Hall that used to be multi-ethnic and is now 1 white guy and the rest Asian. (&#8220;Asian&#8221; in SF generally means Chinese). The Asian woman in charge of hiring only hires other Asians and charges them $3000 for a position!</p>
<p>They bring their culture of corruption with them.  The white guy has been there a long time, prior to the Chinese takeover. When he goes, they will have taken over completely.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that at least two restaurants in my area tend to employ hispanics almost exclusively for behind the scenes type work, i.e. food prep, dish washing, etc.  However, the wait staff is predominantly white with a few blacks thrown in.  The managers are both white.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.  Are we to assume that Ebonics is some construct where black send cryptic messages to each other in public, and us whites don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying?  You&rsquo;re granting them much more intelligence and organization than they actually have.</p>
<p>What I think it is with Ebonics and other ghetto babble is that blacks think they&rsquo;re a lot smarter than they are, so they say things which they think sounds smart and clever coming out of their mouths, but they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying, but it sounds smart to them and to other blacks that are listening, but don&rsquo;t know what the other black is saying, but it sounds like juvenile babble to us whites. </p>
<p>For instance, there was an AR Classic article here a few months ago, about a white lawyer in the black part of town.  One of his black women clients told him, when he asked her about legal fees in arrears, that &#8220;they&rsquo;re putting me through the changes.&#8221;  She didn&rsquo;t know what that meant, but she thinks it sounds really clever.  If she says that to other blacks, they think it&rsquo;s something really clever, but they don&rsquo;t know what it means, either.  The white lawyer doesn&rsquo;t know what it meant.  But I don&rsquo;t think, like you, that &#8220;they&rsquo;re putting me through the changes&#8221; is some secret cryptic code for a really intellectual message.</p>

		<p>Race is not the only engine to drive this issue. Homosexuals and Lesbians have the same tendencies. Now I am wondering. Would a homosexual white manager chose a black homosexual over a white heterosexual for hiring? Who would the homosexual black manager hire, a well to do white homosexual or an aspiring heterosexual <br>
black kid from the Ghetto? Then the Asian,&hellip; Get my drift. <br>
I have seen whole staffs develop sexually as well as racial. </p>
