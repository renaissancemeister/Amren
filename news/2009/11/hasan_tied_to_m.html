<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A key U.S. senator said Sunday he would begin an investigation into whether the Army missed signs that the man accused of opening fire at Fort Hood had embraced an increasingly extremist view of Islamic ideology.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Lieberman&rsquo;s call for the investigation came as word surfaced that Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan apparently attended the same Virginia mosque as two Sept. 11 hijackers in 2001, at a time when a radical imam preached there. Whether Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, associated with the hijackers is something the FBI will probably look into, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Days after a gunman killed 13 people at Fort Hood military base in Texas, information surfaced that the suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, attended the same mosque as two Sept. 11 hijackers in 2001. Hasan held his mother&rsquo;s funeral at the mosque in Falls Church, Va., that year. He remains hospitalized after the Nov. 5 attack in which 29 others were wounded.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;A Horrific Outburst&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The man who allegedly killed 13 people and wounded 29 others at the Fort Hood military base in Texas apparently attended the same mosque as two Sept. 11 hijackers in 2001. Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan held his mother&rsquo;s funeral at the mosque in Falls Church, Va. Hasan, who was born in Virginia to Palestinian parents, remains in intensive care after the Nov. 5 killing spree.</p>
<p>Classmates participating in a 2007-2008 master&rsquo;s program at a military college complained repeatedly to superiors about what they considered Hasan&rsquo;s anti-American views. Dr. Val Finnell said Hasan gave a presentation at the Uniformed Services University that justified suicide bombing and told classmates that Islamic law trumped the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Another classmate said he complained to five officers and two civilian faculty members at the university. He wrote in a command climate survey sent to Pentagon officials that fear in the military of being seen as politically incorrect prevented an &#8220;intellectually honest discussion of Islamic ideology&#8221; in the ranks. The classmate also requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.</p>

		<p>Perosnally I don&rsquo;t think the man was a terrorist or an Islamic Extremist or however you want to put it.  I think he was just messed up from his years of service.  It&rsquo;s awfully convienant for the army to blame this attack on something else other than the army just to keep us still mad at the &#8220;enemy.&#8221;  There is a lot more going here on than they are going to tell us.</p>
<p>There are a record number of soilders coming back from this war killing themselves and others.  It&rsquo;s not easy being a soilder and the army isn&rsquo;t training people to be nice to others.  They are training killers, that&rsquo;s the number one thing they teach you.  TO KILL.</p>

		<p>The CIA knew that Major Hasan was actively linking himself with AQ.  This is why I don&rsquo;t believe that numerous CIA surveillance powers and spying mechanisms are a panacea, even if they&rsquo;re constitutional.  The reason is that the CIA, FBI, ATF and the whole alphabet gang can easily gather information about Hasan and his ilk.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the information they gather show that protected minority racial and religious groups are mostly the ones plotting terrorist acts, so the information gets sent to File 13.  It&rsquo;s like London and Chicago having surveillance cameras on every corner  &mdash;  Fine as far as it goes, but they show mostly blacks doing the crime.  Therefore, the video gets panned.</p>

<b>Obama: Don&rsquo;t Jump to Conclusions&rsquo; About Nidal Malik Hasan</b></p>

<p>I saw a report on CNN about muslims fearing that Americans won&rsquo;t see them as patriotic loyal Americans. I have to wonder why CNN did this story. Did they come up with the idea themselves or did someone suggest they run such a story and provided them with people to interview? </p>

		<p>The greatest sacrifice you can make is for your people, your culture, your religion, or your homeland. Nidal Malik Hasan did exactly what a good Muslim should do   &mdash;   he struck out against the people (Americans) who are killing Muslims and Middle Easterners. In some ways, he was brave.  Surely, he would have preferred the safety of a pilotless drone, or dropping a 5,000 lb bomb from 20,000 ft onto his enemy. However, he had no access to such weapons, and so he did what he could.  </p>
<p>Hasan&rsquo;s actions are completely understandable and expected by someone who is a patriot for his religion or his people.  What is NOT understandable is why our government continues to import millions of Muslims into the USA, where their conservative, backwards, controlling religion is completely incompatible with modern, liberal Western culture.  Muslims have over 40 Islamic nations from which to choose.  There is absolutely no reason to import millions of them into the USA.  We gain little by their presence, while their continued presence among us will be a never-ending source of conflict and terror. </p>

		<p>I would not trust Joe Lieberman farther than I could throw him.  Do not expect Lieberman to give an objective judgment on Nidal Malik Hasan, who was born Palestinian parents.  </p>
<p>The correct remedy should be to tighten our immigration requirements to exclude all except people of European descent who can improve our country.  But look for the government to use this event to gain more power over us and take away our freedom.   </p>
<p>It looks like the government is planning an offensive to make criticizing Political Correctness synonymous with Terrorism.  That way we can be arrested for pointing out the Politically Incorrect fact that all races are not equal.<br>

		<p>The liberal mental disorder known as &#8220;political correctness&#8221; protected Hasan from scrutiny and discipline even as he preached jihad against US soldiers.</p>
<p>The same liberal mental disorder creates &#8220;gun-free zones&#8221; which should actually be called &#8220;victim-disarmament zones.&#8221;  In the late 1970s under President Carter, the fedgov decided to forbid generally soldiers from carrying personal sidearms while on base.  </p>
<p>Liberalism has touched and corrupted every aspect of American life. We can no longer afford it.  Eventually it will need to be completely rooted out.</p>

		<p>I find it hilarious that the military is tippy toeing around this dude religion like it means nothing and he&rsquo;s just mentally disturbed. His religion preaches kill the infidel and convert everyone in the world or else. That said they are looking for a group conspiracy and they don&rsquo;t relise it but the muslims don&rsquo;t need no stinking groups to kill for Allah they will happilly kill for Allah on their own.<br>
 The end result that common sense would call for is the expulsion of muslims but common sense no longer exists in the United States of Political correctness.</p>

<p>I take it officers used to carry around their sidearms all the time? because soldiers certainly carry guns on base. They just don&rsquo;t have bullets unless on the firing range. I think that&rsquo;s a subtext of this story. Only the perp here, on a military base, at a staging area for overseas deployment, only the criminal here had a working gun. </p>

		<p>Reply to concernicus:</p>
<p>Considering that the military is not the fun and adventure recruitment advertising and the lies of military recruiters make it out to be, I sure hope the military draft is not bought back.  I have two nephews who are of the age to be drafted if it is.</p>
<p>As a patriotic American, I am against reinstating the military draft because it would violate the 13th Amendment of the Constitution, against involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.</p>
<p>In World War 11, 120,000 Japanese-Americans were relocated to interment camps because the Emperor of Japan expected all Japanese, wherever they were in the world, to be loyal to him.  However, there were many Japanese-Americans who out of loyalty to America, volunteered for the U.S. Army and fought bravely in Europe.</p>
<p>Anyway, considering that Muslims believe they must kill or convert all &#8220;infidels&#8221;, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, are reasons we need to stop playing nice and take serious action against the Muslim threat to our country.</p>

<p>A point of information here that may help you keep this in proper context from a veteran of 12 years service, Major Hasan like other military personnel with civilian professional skills (medical doctors and attorneys) just barely a soldier.  These people are made Captains immediately on entrance to the service right out of their college programs and are promoted to Major soon after when they pass their respective certification boards.</p>
<p>Major Hasan would have received very little military training and in fact many of these people can barely wear their uniforms correctly.   This guy probably never even had to qualify with firearms during his very abbreviated military introductory training.  The PTSD angle that some people in the media are trying to push is preposterous.  Until Major Hasan decided to murder as many unarmed American soldiers as he could he had never heard a shot fired in anger or served in any military deployment.  He is not and will never be a soldier.</p>
<p>Some of the apologist left who hate our military and are ashamed of our country have tried to justify his homicidal outburst as brought on because in some conversations where Hasan was attacking the US and denigrating our military and our culture with real Americans some of them called him ethnic slurs or challenged his patriotism.  Since when has &#8220;he called me a name&#8221; been a justification for unprovoked murder against innocent people?  Hasan&rsquo;s primary identity was to the Islamic faith and as such he was being a good muslim and killing the enemies of his faith just as his Imams and the Koran require him to do. </p>
<p>The real problem that we need to sort out is putting a stake through the heart of institutional Political Correctness that is making it impossible for us to use common sense in identifying and dealing with threats to our soldiers, our country and our way of life.  The Army chain of command must be required to answer for their failure to discharge Hasan after multiple reports by service members that the man was a sympathizer with radical Islam.  Cowardly career officers who were afraid to deal with a protected minority who clearly needed to be discharged from service are directly responsible for allowing this venomous Islamic snake access to our soldiers.</p>

<p>I disagree, he definitely was a terrorist. He chose to join the military, nobody forced him. He wanted to use the USA to pay for his medical school. Also, he worked as a doctor, a psychiatrist to be exact, he never fought in any type of combat and he made a huge salary, over 6 figures. His reasons for the killings were cold and calculating. He followed the tenants of his beliefs of killing infidels(non-muslims). The bad part was he was open about what he was and he was not kicked out of the military.</p>

		<p>Homeland Security and the FBI spend considerable amounts of money monitering USA mosques, Muslim charities, organizations, and web-sites.  Although the FBI has managed to twart numerous terroritst plots against Americans, they have missed others,  One thing is certain: there will be more terrorist acts by immigrant Muslims on American Citizens, in the years to come.  </p>
<p>Homeland Security and the FBI won&rsquo;t tell us how much they spend on monitoring domestic Muslims, but I&rsquo;m sure the amount is astronomical.  Muslims contribute little to America.  With their large families, their schooling and medical care are expensive, they kill Americans inside our very country, and they suck up a major portion of HS &amp; FBI budgets.  No benefit, but high costs.  Yet, we continue to import hundreds of thousands of them into our home, where they will be a perpetual source of friction and conflict between us &amp; them.  This is pure insanity.  End all Muslim immigration now.  Spend the savings on American Citizens. </p>

		<p>If Hasan had been an ultra-conservative Roman Catholic who openly professed that all governments which do not give a privileged position to the RC Church must be overthrown, he would have been out of the Army in a second.  If Hasan had been a conservative Southern Baptist who believed that anyone who did not profess Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour was evil, he would also have been out in a second.  The PCArmy, however, would not risk offending Muslims by throwing out a man who was obviously unstable.</p>
<p>Another thought, Hasan has a history of being treated for alcohol abuse.  Apparently he was not much of a Muslim either, or maybe, he was using his fanaticism as an excuse for breaking Muslim law.</p>

		<p>Please note paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 in the excerpted article below that appeared yesterday on Yahoo:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – A U.S. official says the Fort Hood shooting suspect reached out to communicate with a radical imam overseas who came under scrutiny in the past for possible links to terror groups.</p>
<p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity&hellip;, says Nidal Malik sent electronic communications to Anwar al Awlaki. Awlaki writes a blog which, among other things, denounces U.S. policies as anti-Muslim.</p>
<p>The official says the messages were picked up by U.S. counterterrorism officials, but that an inquiry into the matter was shelved because the contacts were not deemed to suggest a threat&hellip;</p>
<p>A radical American imam living in Yemen who had contact with two 9/11 hijackers praised Hasan as a hero on his personal Web site Monday.</p>
<p>The posting on the Web site for Anwar al Awlaki, who was a spiritual leader at two mosques where three 9/11 hijackers worshipped, said American Muslims who condemned the Fort Hood attack are hypocrites who have committed treason against their religion.</p>
<p>Two U.S. intelligence officials told The Associated Press the Web site was Awlaki&rsquo;s. They spoke on condition of anonymity&hellip;</p>
<p>Hasan&rsquo;s family attended the Dar al Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., where Awlaki was preaching in 2001. Hasan&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s funeral was held at the mosque on May 31, 2001&hellip;around the same time two 9/11 hijackers worshipped at the mosque and while Awlaki was preaching.</p>
<p>The Falls Church mosque is one of the largest on the East Coast, and thousands of worshippers attend prayers and services there every week.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_fort_hood_shooting</p>
<p>But the link takes you today to an updated version, in which the information in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 has been omitted!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned, finally, that when something first happens is the time to gobble up news reports on it, because later some hand seems to reach down and wipe out important but &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; information.</p>

		<p>The most entertaining aspect of all this is the MSM&rsquo;s diversity programming aftermath of this grotesque event - quickly chanted at us in unison by the usual liberal establishment media mouthpieces.</p>
<p>Oww, he&rsquo;s not a terrorist, oww, maybe he&rsquo;s not a terrorist, oww, he&rsquo;s a disturbed soldier, oww, he was under great stress, oww, perhaps his conscience made him do it&hellip;etc., ad nauseum.</p>
<p>This sociopathic creep, who considered himself a muslim first and an American never, stoked hatred for all the happy non-muslims around him who lived far freer and richer, non-muslim lives - even as they battled muslim terrorists in the middle east. He ultimately embraced his culturally and religiously retarded homicidal confusion - to &#8216;please Allah&rsquo; - by becoming a screaming suicidal muslim terrorist murderer.</p>
<p>The Muslim Koran orders murderous hatred against non-muslims, and thousands of frantically ignorant fools like Hasan learn it well.     </p>

		<p>The military and the govt simply lack the courage to admit that most Muslims are antiAmerican, and that a large percentage would aid and abet terrorists in a second. Hasan was a murdering terrorist as much an enemy of the US as any spy and as much as the 9/11 killers.</p>
<p> Is anyone investigating his associates? Will Obama call this slug for what he is? No. Slugs like each other.</p>

		<p>You know, this is not a surprise.  I believe it IS a terrorist action, despite what the PC guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t says.  There is a book, published in 2003, written by an anonymous author, published by HarperCollins, called &#8220;Terrorist Hunter.&#8221;  The author is a brilliant Iraqui woman who is fluent in English, Hebrew, and several Arabic dialects.  She served as an undercover agent here in the USA, and much of what she found out has subsequently been on the news.  It is worth a read, because there are other items that are still on the terrorists&rsquo; agenda   &mdash;   and they will probably come true in this PC atmosphere currently prevailing in the USA.  Scary!</p>

		<p>Just to clairify my position on the US Military.  I do not hate soilders and I feel sick to my stomach every time I see another has died.  Both Grandfathers served in Korea, I had a couple of Great Uncles who were storming the beach on DDay.  I have several friends in the Marines two of whom have died on duty in Iraq.  But this government has a history of and has done nothing but lie to us about everything.  I don&rsquo;t care for Muslims, Blacks, Hispanics, whatever.  I just think we need to get the facts straight.  You don&rsquo;t trust what Obama says, you don&rsquo;t trust our congress, you say the PC Military is why this has happened, who runs the military?  Is it really such a stretch that they can lie some more to get us to react, to divide us even more?  A HOUSE DIVIDED CANNOT STAND.  That&rsquo;s what they want.  You talk about learning the facts, I&rsquo;m not saying I have them, but lets think outside the box a little here.</p>

<p>I agree completely.  If you love your religion and people, then you will defend them, and that is exactly what Hasan did.  Of course, I love America, and I would be the first to put a bullet in Hasan&rsquo;s head.  But, the point is, what Hasan did was logical and expected, given that he is a Muslim and an ethnic Middle Easterner.  This is why we must END MUSLIM IMMIGRATION INTO THE USA NOW! </p>

		<p>For the last three days I&rsquo;ve heard from numerous news media&rsquo;s how it is so insane for our military and even populace to except into it, a population of people who&rsquo;s religion is in exact opposition to the Nations original, native, culture and religion.</p>
<p>Astounded am I that for all these years, since the founding of this great country of the United States of America, there has already been a race/religion of people who are in direct opposition of the principles this country was founded upon.  A race/religion who holds no patriotism to any country or government it inhabits, a religion who hates all those who are not in it&rsquo;s spacific race/religion, a race who believes any not of it&rsquo;s race/religion are no more than cattle, to be used, abused, and indeed killed for the betterment of it&rsquo;s own purpose.</p>
<p>This anti-muslim movement makes no sense, as our ancient enemy uses everything including muslims against us.  To gain control of this powerful force would to be to eliminate 95% of our global problems.</p>

		<p> &#8220;The Army chain of command must be required to answer for their failure to discharge Hasan after multiple reports by service members that the man was a sympathizer with radical Islam. Cowardly career officers who were afraid to deal with a protected minority who clearly needed to be discharged from service are directly responsible for allowing this venomous Islamic snake access to our soldiers.&#8221;  &hellip;.

		<p>As a retired army officer who proudly served in WW II, Korea and Vietnam, it destroys me to say this, but I would get down on my knees to beg my grandsons NOT to join this country&rsquo;s armed forces. To put it bluntly: decent white American boys are being used for cheap cannon fodder by gutless commanding officers who&rsquo;ve mastered the politically correct bull**it required for personal advancement in today&rsquo;s military. When an obvious psychopath like Hasan is given carte blanche to search out and destroy military cohesiveness, protocol and (finally) personnel  &mdash;  all in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;  &mdash;  then it is time for all rational young white men to give up on the military itself. Selling used cars has finally become a more noble profession than being a soldier. Why have your sense of patriotism and duty turned against you by senior officers who snicker at your traditional values even as they manipulate them to advance their own careers? Take it from one who has watched it all happen, the US Army has degenerated into a tragic, pc-spouting, limp-wristed travesty of its former self. Winning is no longer as important as promoting diversity. White Christians are expendable; Muslims are not. The ugly truth is, the military is no longer a proper place for any white male (or female) warrior who possesses a shred of self-respect. Once proud and noble, today&rsquo;s military has become the embarrassing stepchild of liberal politicians (most of whom never served)who are determined to undermine its foundations. It is helmed by officers who are better suited for Madison Avenue public relations firms than they are for safeguarding the soldiers under their command. This realization is like a knife through my heart, but when I think of the great warriors that I had the privilege to serve under  &mdash;  men like George Patton  &mdash;  I cannot escape the fact that a willingness to serve in today&rsquo;s military is a direct slap in the face to the mighty military men who once defended this nation&hellip; As I approach my nineties, I realize how very glad I am that I will not live to see the horrific comeuppance in store for this country.</p>

		<p>Yes, this was a vile act perpetrated by somebody who was inflamed by Muslim religion and ideology. But it was just the act of <i><b>one</b></i> terribly disturbed person.</p>
<p>When radical Islam decides to commit another terrorist atrocity, they will try to perpetrate something which will make 9/11 look insignificant, i.e. they will attempt to strike at multiple locations at the same time, or to hit one location with such deadly force that thousands will be killed or major disruptions to our society will occur. We must be on our guard!<br>

<p>Without the Immigration Act of 1965, which stipulates 90% of immigrants to the US must be non-white third world peoples, neither of these atrocities would have occurred.  Anyone who fights to maintain this anti-white hate law, keep legal (and ergo illegal) immigration as is, is a traitor to the US and it&rsquo;s founding population. </p>

		<p>To ExMilitaryMan:</p>
<p>First, thank you for your honesty and many years of service for the cause of freedom.</p>
<p>I too am a veteran of Southeast Asia and I too have strongly advised all my children to not join the US Military. Only my son in law went against my wishes and joined the Army.</p>
<p>He started out in the Mechanized Infantry driving a Bradley but given his superior shooting skills was sent to Ft. Benning and completd the sniper school. From there forward he was sent &#8220;downrange&#8221; to Kosovo, Bosnia then Macedonia to kill both soldiers and SAM missle sites.</p>
<p>His life was put in grave danger when the Clinton traitors fully equipted the Kosovo Liberation Army with state of the art gear and weapons. He fully recognized that in multiple phone calls and letters he sent me and my daughter. Thank God he survived the missions and returned home safely. Even after serving four years, two in combat, the Army attempted to force him to stay in since his sniper skills were in short supply. We were able to successfully fight that keeping him a civilian.</p>
<p>Again, I ECHO your advice, do not sacrifice your precious children or grandchildren to the traitors in Washington DC!</p>
