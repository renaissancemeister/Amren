<h1>Swiss Referendum Stirs a Debate About Islam</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Ball and Anita Greil, Wall Street Journal, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An emotional debate over the role of Islam in Switzerland is heating up as a referendum approaches that would ban the construction of minarets on mosques.</p>
<p>On Nov. 29, the Swiss will vote on a referendum to ban the construction of minarets, an initiative promoted by the right-wing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, who argue that a minaret is a symbol of Islamic intolerance. {snip}</p>
<p>The debate comes in a country that has prided itself on integrating its large immigrant population and that largely avoided the clashes over the rights of Muslim minorities seen elsewhere in Europe. Business and political interests are especially worried about a possible backlash from the Muslim world.</p>
<p>For example, Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group Ltd. is worried that its relations with Muslim countries  &mdash;  an important destination for its goods  &mdash;  will be imperiled if the initiative passes. &#8220;The brand &#8216;Swiss&rsquo; must continue to represent values such as openness, pluralism and freedom of religion,&#8221; said Hanspeter Rentsch, member of the executive group management board at Swatch. &#8220;Under no circumstances must it be brought in connection with hatred, animosity towards foreigners and narrow-mindedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swiss People&rsquo;s Party gathered twice the required signatures needed to call a vote. Its campaign used posters depicting a woman in a burqa in front of a row of minarets shaped like missiles. Some cities, such as Basel, have banned the posters, while Zurich and others have allowed them in the name of free speech.</p>
<p>The party, the country&rsquo;s largest political group and a fierce critic of immigration, drew international criticism for a campaign poster two years ago showing a white sheep kicking a black sheep out of Switzerland.</p>
<p>A national poll by state-owned media group SRG shows that 53% of voters oppose the ban and 34% support it. Muslim leaders, who have taken a low-key approach to the controversy, are nonetheless worried.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some say that even defeating the referendum won&rsquo;t dissolve the tension. &#8220;It won&rsquo;t end with this,&#8221; says Hisham Maizer, head of the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Switzerland. &#8220;The debate about Islam in Switzerland has just begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The controversy is unusual in a country where 20% of the population are counted as foreigners, and which has taken a pragmatic approach to integrating its immigrants. About 400,000, or roughly 5%, of Swiss residents are Muslim. Most are of Turkish or Balkan origin, with a small minority from the Arab world.</p>
<p>According to a government poll in 2000, less than 15% of Swiss Muslims actively practice their faith. Indeed, only four of the roughly 150 mosques in Switzerland have minarets. Laws against sound pollution forbid mosques from using minarets to hold speakers for the call to prayer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Swiss government has come out strongly against the minaret referendum, fearful of a radicalization of Muslims at home and reprisals against Swiss interests abroad. A yes vote &#8220;could make Switzerland a target for Islamic terrorism,&#8221; said Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey.</p>
<p>Swiss diplomats are working to reassure their counterparts in Muslim countries that Bern opposes the initiative. A working group is also monitoring the media in those countries for signs of backlash. So far, Bern hasn&rsquo;t detected a rise in anti-Swiss sentiment, according to one official.</p>
<p>Swiss businesses, many with large interests in Muslim countries, have come out against the referendum, for fear of a boycott like one that hit Denmark in 2005 following a controversy over published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. Nestlé SA, which has about 50 factories and 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($5.36 billion) of sales in Muslim countries, has declined to take a stance on the referendum.</p>
<p>According to Economiesuisse, Switzerland&rsquo;s main business association, about 7%, or 14.5 billion francs, of Switzerland&rsquo;s total exports go to predominantly Muslim countries. In 2008, those exports rose 14%, compared with a rise in overall exports of 4.3%. Switzerland is still bruised from a spat with Libya that led that country to cut off oil exports to Switzerland for a time.</p>

<p>Some say feminism is the soft underbelly of the white race.  That&rsquo;s true, but even worse is the insatiable desire for money that plagues many of our alpha males.  They sell out their own for money and power. </p>

<p>These two statements indicate that the Swiss are indeed headed for violent confrontation with the muslims and despite the statement of most being from Turkey or the Balkans, I would suggest that many are from Africa and Pakistan, at least the trouble makers will be from there.</p>

<p>Of course we must sacrifice every value that we hold so big business can continue to make money. These rich parasites will do anything to preserve their privileged lifestyle - including selling out their own people. When the U.S. is grovelling as a third world dump, perhaps some of its apparently mindless people will remember that it was their own wealthy countrymen who sold them out with affirmative action, free trade, outsourcing, open borders, etc. These benevolent-sounding terms are part of the propaganda package that is being used to keep Whites in their place. The other part of the package is professional sports. Our couch potato Whites brothers sit on their fat butts all weekend and idolize black athletes who hate them and laugh at them. They think they are cool when they get the athlete&rsquo;s autograph - even as he practically spits in their face with contempt for their stupidity! Wake up Whites!</p>

<p>-Yes, but once you allow Muslims to own property, they deem it theirs for eternity and claim it for the Ummah (body of Islamic adherents). Once the creeping is allowed, Switzerland would eventually become Muslim dominant and thus associated with hatred, animosity and narrow-mindedness. Touché Hanspeter Rentsch!</p>
<p>The Swiss only wish to subsist as Swiss in bliss.</p>

		<p>Had the Swiss never allowed Muslim immigration, and had there never been a Mosque in Switzerland, the question would be moot.  The Muslim countries would have simply looked at Switzerland as a European Christian nation and continued to buy their watches, just as the Arabs Muslims see themslves as, well, Arab Muslims.  But now they have been invited in and they see how weak and feeble Christian civilization has become.  All they must do is complain about poor treatment and some Sheik or Cleric will come to their assistance.  And the Swiss will accomodate.</p>
<p>The problem was giving away their birth right.  What did Switzerland need with Muslims by the way?</p>

		<p>Just as they did in Jerusalem and elsewhere, the belief is that wherever a mosque is built, that is Muslim territory.  Switzerland, like much of Europe, may well have new national names within 50 years - if they don&rsquo;t learn to fight this off.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you, Sofita! The greed of our own business people has done a great deal in tranforming parts of our western democracies into Third World enclaves. And just think about John McCains&rsquo;s proposal for amnesty for illegals, during the 2008 elections.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have governements that act like they work for our richest business people, who want lots of new immigrants, as a new reserve of cheap labor!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The brand &lsquo;Swiss&rsquo; must continue to represent values such as openness, pluralism and freedom of religion,&rdquo;  &hellip;and those are values that will be common in an Islamic Europe?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  In order for freedom to prosper, one must be intolerant of intolerance.  Furthermore, there is no value as important as protecting your own genetic interests - along with whatever culture, language and religion come bundled with it.</p>

		<p>  Recent events in Texas seem to cast doubts on the successful assimilation of Muslims into Western Societies. I fear the transformation of Europe will be the exact opposite of what dedicated leftists and multiculturalists envision.</p>

		<p>The Swiss have the strictest stand against immigration in Europe, much to their credit. They should not cave in like we did and most of Europe is doing now, to muslim invasion. Islamic hordes were stopped at the gates of Vienna before, and that&rsquo;s where the line should be drawn in the sand.</p>

<p>This would be ridiculous, if it weren&rsquo;t so deadly serious. We are all getting tired of the muslims and their incessant importuning to restore the world to 7th century barbarism, and then have violent tantrums when they don&rsquo;t get their way or feel slighted. There is something very wrong with these people.<br>

<p>This excerpt says it all. Since when has Muslim culture shown itself to be compatible with &#8220;openness, pluralism and freedom of religion?&#8221; &#8220;Hatred, animosity towards foreigners and narrow-mindedness&rdquo; is more the order of the day. </p>

		<p>Does the lack of minarets in Japan hurt the sales of Japanese products in the Moslem world?  No, because they never let any Moslems immigrate in the first place.  True, if Whites begin to stand up to the Third World they will hate us for it, but they despise us anyway.  We may as well have their respect along with their hatred.  Whites everywhere need to accept the fact that reclaiming our land and culture will intensify conflict.  It&rsquo;s called defending ourselves.  </p>
