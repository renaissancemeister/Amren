<h1>Illegal Workers Quietly Let Go</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lornet Turnbull, Seattle Times, November 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A janitorial company owned by a local conservative talk-radio host is among the early targets of a new strategy by the Obama administration to thin the ranks of illegal immigrants by going after the companies that hire them.</p>
<p>Seattle Building Maintenance, owned by KVI talk-radio host Peter Weissbach and his wife, provides janitorial services in buildings throughout the Puget Sound region, including such Seattle landmarks as the Seattle Art Institute, Pacific Place, Metropolitan Park and the Dexter Horton and Westin buildings.</p>
<p>The subject of an ongoing immigration audit by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the company has been clearing its books by firing some of its janitorial staff  &mdash;  about 100 people so far  &mdash;  believed to be working illegally.</p>
<p>The probe of Seattle Building Maintenance offers an early glimpse into ICE&rsquo;s approach to worksite enforcement  &mdash;  stealthily targeting employers rather than workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, workers are quietly let go by their employers, without the direct contact with immigration agents that might lead to deportation.</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates who initially lauded the shift in strategy as more humane are now seeing the impact it has on workers unable to find new jobs in a slow economy, while their employers appear to escape largely unscathed, much as they did under the old policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Service Employees International Union Local 6, which represents about 280 of Seattle Building&rsquo;s workers, said as many as 150 of them might be undocumented. The company has an estimated workforce of up to 300 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Immigration audit</b></p>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s new enforcement approach was showcased in Los Angeles last month when American Apparel fired 1,800 immigrant employees  &mdash;  more than a quarter of its workforce  &mdash;  after an immigration audit.</p>
<p>And a janitorial company in Minnesota quietly fired 1,200 workers around the same time after an investigation found they were working there illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the cases in Minnesota and California suggest that employers are escaping penalty and that the administration&rsquo;s new policy appears to deter neither employers nor the illegal-immigrant workers they hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does nothing to address the millions of people in the country illegally&#8221; who have an incentive to remain here as long as possible in the hopes of eventually winning amnesty, Mehlman said.</p>

<p>This country is on the way out, eight along with its empire status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about ready to go belly up and it continues its wars of aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan, with an eye toward invading Iran, to say nothing about the empire&rsquo;s troops in Europe, North Korea, and the South Pacific.</p>

		<p>Conservative talk radio hosts are a large part of the problem.  They are there to distract &#8220;angry white males&#8221; from racial issues.  That&rsquo;s why &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; like WABC radio has these people on the air.  Talk radio hosts are the false opposition.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not completely against this. But I would like to see them start ramping up penalties on employers while denying welfare claims from illegals. That would be a tremendous incentive for illegals to self-deport.</p>

		<p>Hmm,let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.get them fired but don&rsquo;t deport them causing them to become A.criminals or B. welfare recipents on order to survive.Then give them &#8220;amnesty&#8221; letting them stay here and continue to be criminals,welfare recipents or both.Also adding  more voters to the rolls who will keep this screwed up system in place!Awesome plan!Move along&hellip;&hellip;.no conspiracy here&hellip;..that&rsquo;s just crazed radical teabagger talk.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Joe&#8221; How right you are! Too many still buy into all this &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk-radio blather, insisting that these clowns who suckle at the Neocon teat and denounce us evil &#8220;racists&#8221; every chance they get, are somehow really on our side in this great racial struggle for survival. Their distractions ultimately do just as much harm to the White Race as any liberal. While the talk-radio types howled incessantly about &#8220;Islamofascists&#8221; and similar boogeymen for ten years, this country&rsquo;s Hispanic population grew exponentially to well over 40 million strong, changing the entire demographic make-up of America forever. Then there are the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, and many thousands of lives squandered on the pointless wars championed from behind the talk-radio microphone to the day! That these collective Neocon blowhards STILL feel no guilt whatsoever in perpetuating this great military fraud is unconscionable. </p>
<p>Until Whites realize that modern conservatism is as much part of the problem as it is the solution, nothing much of great worth can be accomplished.   </p>

		<p>Joe, post # 2 said it all! </p>
<p>I no longer listen to these &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk shows. I finally woke up to their &#8220;agenda&#8221;. Keep the Whites busy on so-called real issues and make them think they are doing something by having &#8220;Tea Parties&#8221;!  Even that has a sissified name to give the White man&rsquo;s &#8220;movement&#8221;&hellip;who can take them seriously with that name? They will NEVER mention race/diversity as the problem, in fact they denounce White &#8220;racists&#8221; and want no part of them in their little movement. Even Ron Paul has said as much. We have NO ONE to lead the White race out of this mess we are in.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Anon.  &#8220;Conservative&#8221; talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham pride themselves on their &#8220;political incorrectness&#8221; but don&rsquo;t have the testosterone or estrogen to deal with the real issues because deep down they are as terrified of being associated with the charge of racism as any of the liberals they routinely excoriate.  Their phony irreverance truly annoys me.  It&rsquo;s poetic justice that one of them has been hoisted on his own petard.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a time, even once, when &#8220;conservativism&#8221; actually implemented its agenda&hellip;.as opposed to simply giving lip service to it, and then governing exactly the way liberals do (not to mention acting like liberals in all other ways)?</p>
<p>Conservativism is a lie.  What we need is nationalism.</p>
