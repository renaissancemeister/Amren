<h1><a href="https://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/12/team-of-8-deputies-quietly-rounds-up-illegals/">Houston Sheriffs Round Up Thousands of Illegals</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Barnes, Washington Times, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Phoenix gets all the media attention for his crackdown on illegal immigrants, eight deputies in an unremarkable office at the Harris County Jail are posting similar numbers for deportation  &mdash;  and doing so without controversy.</p>
<p>Working two per shift, the deputies refer roughly 1,000 suspected illegal immigrants to federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities every month, helping to make the Southern District of Texas by far the busiest in the nation for illegal-immigration prosecutions.</p>
<p>Since joining a federal program in August 2008 that trains local law authorities to enforce immigration law, the sheriff&rsquo;s office has turned up high-level gang members, a suspect wanted for murder in Mexico, and illegal immigrants from countries around the world, Lt. Michael Lindsay said.</p>
<p>Harris County frequently refers more cases in a given month than any other local police agency in the program, he said.</p>
<p>But what makes the Harris County program stand apart is a routine that insulates it from the accusations of profiling that have drawn prominent criticism to programs like that run by Sheriff Arpaio in Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>
<p>Unlike in Maricopa County, Harris County authorities do not run street sweeps in search of illegal immigrants. But they do question everybody booked into the jail about their immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fingerprints from all inmates accused of felonies or serious misdemeanors are forwarded automatically to ICE&rsquo;s data center, which can identify matches to prints from immigrants who have had prior dealings with law enforcement.</p>
<p>Jail officers specially trained to determine immigration status can question and check the fingerprints of anyone suspected of a lesser crime.</p>
<p>Those who are still suspected of illegal immigration are referred to ICE agents working on site who can ask the county to turn over inmates to the agency upon their release from jail.</p>
<p>Referrals that ICE pursues are prosecuted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. According to a Syracuse University study based on federal records, the Houston-based court handled nearly 23,000 immigration prosecutions in the first nine months of fiscal 2009  &mdash;  by far the most of any district court in the country and a projected increase of 22 percent over last year.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office was the first in the country to use the Secure Communities program, which gives local law enforcement access to immigration databases. {snip}</p>
<p>Despite the even-handed approach, Harris County&rsquo;s program has its critics, some of whom testified to the Harris County Commission before the program was renewed last month. They argued that it too often targets perpetrators of petty misdemeanors, causing undue hardship on families and discouraging immigrants from reporting crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the sheriff&rsquo;s office maintains that its approach provides an important law enforcement tool. The jail inmates &#8220;would not come to our attention if they had not broken the law or been accused of breaking the law,&#8221; Lt. Lindsay said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Hispanic and immigrant groups urged the Obama administration to end the program. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision not to use 287(g) for patrol officers by both of Houston&rsquo;s biggest police departments stands in contrast to agencies using the program that have drawn the most attention, most notably Phoenix.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m glad Houston is helping to enforce immigration law, the downside is that every person booked into the hoosegow has to be asked and searched for immigration status, including the few white people, obvious native-born Americans.</p>

		<p>This is good news! I have the impression that Sheriff Arpaio may be trying a little too hard to attract attention to himself. That isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad, if it scares illegals away from his territory, but results are what counts.</p>

		<p>According to Michael Scheuer, many possible terrorists have come across the border disguised as illegals. I believe he has mentioned Houston as a likely target for a dirty bomb. He also has said the probability of another, bigger attack as very close to 100%.<br>

		<p>Proof illegal immigrants are often also criminals of other crimes and that law enforcement can achieve reduction of illegal entries. US has three generations of entitlement children because politicians ignored vital immigration protections for US citizens.  Congratulations to the police for protecting US citizens from fiscal blackmail and from millions aiding and abetting illegal crimes and birth tourism.  It is way past due. V</p>

		<p>I will enthusiastically applaud the Sherriff of Harris County, TX ( or any other border area law enforcement) for any progress they make in removing illegal aliens from the US.  If their methods are legal and effective then more power to them and may they go safely about their appreciated work.<br>
However, as a citizen of Maricopa Country, AZ, I and most of the legal residents elected Sherriff Joe Arpaio (and the country attorney, Andrew Thomas) greatly appreciate his dedicated efforts to remove illegal aliens from this area.  We don&rsquo;t appreciate the writer taking self-serving pot shots at Sherriff Joe.  The poor man has local illegals protesting his every move and establishment law enforcement from Phoenix to Washington D.C. running interference for the illegals rather than trying to help solve a vexing probem.  A lesser  man would have given up and resigned, retired long ago!<br>

		<p>&#8220;I see this every day,&#8221; said Silvia Mintz, an immigration lawyer speaking for the immigrant rights group Pastors in Action. Ms. Mintz said the policy looks good on paper, but in practice &#8220;they can decide to arrest you if you don&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license, if you have a taillight not working.&#8221; </p>
<p>Boy, here we go again. There is always a lower standard demanded for hispanics. &#8216;Immigrant rights group (fill in the blank here)&rsquo; say that enforcing the law for minor crimes is wrong if it results in the arrest of hispanics, legal or (especially) not legal.  The whining never ends, does it?</p>
<p>Ya know, if I went to Mexico and tried to work without a permit and I was found out, I would be thrown in jail. Maybe the same should apply here to Mexicans.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;ll take every deportation I can get, it is important to remember that this is an Obama Administration program designed to pull the wool over the eyes of the average American.</p>
<p>Even Washington DC and super-liberal Montgomery County MD participate in this program.</p>
<p>What the government is doing is creating 2 classes of illegal aliens in our minds.  The &#8220;Bad&#8221; illegal aliens, who commit crimes, and the &#8220;Good&#8221; illegal aliens who don&rsquo;t.  We&rsquo;re supposed to thank the government for getting rid of the &#8220;Bad&#8221; illegal aliens, and accept the presence of &#8220;Good&#8221; illegal aliens who are, after all, just hard-working folks trying to make a better life for their families&hellip;  </p>

<p>Oh goodie, let&rsquo;s wait until AFTER a crime was commited.  At least no one can call you a racist and we all know that&rsquo;s WAY worse than driving over a pedestrian in your pick-up after drinking 20 &#8220;cervezas.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Sheriff might be doing a bang up job of booking and identifying illegal aliens. ICE on the other hand is not really deporting enough of them fast enough. ICE operates in a shroud of secrecy regarding cases in the specific and in the aggragate abstract. One can only surmise that such a state of affairs is created to allow the feds to not do their job and them crank out out a bunch of meaningless &#8220;enforcement results&#8221; statistics.</p>

		<p>If this sheriff isn&rsquo;t on the radical leftists radar screen, like Geraldo Rivera, then he will be.  But, in the meantime he&rsquo;s in there pitching.</p>
<p>But the best way to get rid of the illegals is to put pressure on the employers to keep from hiring them, and to neutralize the radicals and groups who support them.  There is no other way to stop this downward spiral. </p>
<p>We are now in a position economically that is getting worse and will continue its direction toward huge job losses that will bottom out in about 2012, along with the economy.</p>
<p>When they tell us the recession is in a jobless recovery, we have to understand that there is no such thing as a jobless recovery, since this capitalist engine is fueled by consumer spending, and we have not yet reached the worst part.</p>
<p>Along with tax riots, I think we&rsquo;re going to see much protestations over joblessness, and that, as a natural consequence of the situation, people will be taking to the streets, protesting the outsouce of work overseas and illegal immigrants stealing American jobs, given to them by the same greedy bunch who has rejected American workers all along.</p>
<p>The jobs that have already been lost are gone forever  &mdash;    &mdash;  except for those outsourced.  We are well on our way to a Brazillian society where the delineation between the rich and poor is marked by walled and gated communities.  The rabble will rule the streets at night.</p>
<p>At any time during our progression to this state of affairs, there will be many protest groups form, all of them armed, and the slightest spark could ignite any situation into a national conflict. </p>

		<p>What I understand is the border patrol is on on the deals.  They get paid off to look the other way when dope and illegals come in, and if they don&rsquo;t get paid, they simply &#8220;catch&#8221; those and it makes them look like they are doing their job.  It is a big hoax!</p>

		<p>This should never have gotten this far. Illegal aliens being rounded up and deported should never be thought of as a unique, sometime phenomenon. It should be as natural, regular, and anticipated as the government taxing Americans to death is.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to look into it, but what about a phone# for any citizen can call if they suspect illegals in the neighborhood.<br>
I suppose the system they have there at Harris County is effective since they already have the illegals in  their custody.<br>
