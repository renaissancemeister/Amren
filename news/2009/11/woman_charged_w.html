			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kim Janssen and Joel Hood, Chicago Tribune, November 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A suburban Chicago woman has been charged with a hate crime for allegedly yanking the head scarf of a Muslim woman in Tinley Park two days after the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas.</p>
<p>Valerie Kenney, 54, a bank teller from Tinley Park, appeared at the Bridgeview Courthouse today and was released on $5,000 bail. If convicted of the felony, Kenney faces up to 3 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. She is due back in court Dec. 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think (a charge of hate crime) sends the appropriate message that these kinds of race-based lash-outs are unacceptable,&#8221; said Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. &#8220;Every time something like (the Fort Hood shootings) happens, the Muslim community prepares for a backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amal Abusumayah, 28, told police she was shopping at a Tinley Park grocery store Nov. 7 when a middle-age woman passed her in the aisle and made a loud reference to the killings at Fort Hood.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said, &#8216;The man that did that shooting in Texas was from the Middle East,&rsquo; in a really loud and angry voice,&#8221; Abusumayah told the Tribune last week. Minutes later, while Abusumayah was paying for her groceries at a self-checkout, the woman approached her from behind and tugged hard on her blue and beige head scarf, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The scarf incident was the first of two apparent race-related attacks in Tinley Park in the wake of the Fort Hood shootings, Police Chief Michael O&rsquo;Connell said. On Nov. 8, a Muslim family found racist graffiti on the front of their home, O&rsquo;Connell said. The  person rang the family&rsquo;s doorbell but ran off,  O&rsquo;Connell said.</p>
<p>He said hate crimes such as the one Kenney is charged with &#8220;attack the dignity of people because of their religious beliefs, race or sexual orientation, and we don&rsquo;t tolerate that here.&#8221;<br>

<p>And just look at the horror of this backlash.  A muslim&rsquo;s headscarf pulled. Meanwhile scores of white people are regularly beaten, murdered and raped by minorities in this country with nary a word said, certainly no mention of any such &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Punishing an alleged catfight with no injuries is what police do when they don&rsquo;t have anything better to do   &mdash;   which of course they don&rsquo;t in Tinley Park, since Tinley Park is 93% white and 2% black.</p>

		<p>Yet if this White woman had cut in front of the Muslim woman in the checkout line and the Muslim woman socked her in the jaw, she would probably be charged with a misdemeanor and gotten off with probation.</p>
<p>There are no two ways about it. Hate crime laws are anti-White people and little more.</p>

		<p>It will take more than tugging to change the hearts-and-minds of Muslims in America. But talking about Ft. Hood and other incidents of Islamist strife will surely help. The audience for this will not be Muslims, of course, but rather the rest of us. When we are fed up with them, they will feel compelled to change in accord with our wishes.</p>

		<p>Any hate crimes pending for the Ft Hood shooter?  I mean afterall he did &#8220;attack people for the dignity of people because of their religious beliefs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any hate crimes for the countless Whites that are attacked by Blacks simply because they are white?  </p>
<p>Really, the problem is people like &#8220;Police Chief Michael O&rsquo;Connell&#8221; because they charge &#8220;incidents&#8221; like this, BUT will not charge a crime when its Whitey who is stabbed, beaten, raped or killed (see Ft Hood, Christian/Newsom Murders, Anne Pressly, etc) .  I guess it&rsquo;s because Whites have the power and we cannot have anybody be rascist against them. (sound of laughing in the background).</p>

		<p>Notice that &#8220;graffiti&#8221; (probably did it themselves) and pulling on a scarf are called &#8220;attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hate crimes charges are riders that need an original criminal charge to be tacked on to.  What was the original charge here?  I fail to see how yanking on a scarf, at most the lightest misdemeanor, can be turned into a felony.  AFAIK, though I don&rsquo;t fully understand IL law, only an original underlying felony offense can get hate crime rider that is a felony.  If the original crime is a misdem, then hate riders are also a misdem.</p>

I guess nothing will be done about what is happening to Whites in our own country until WE do something about it and not tolerate these morons like that police chief who feels he has to be intolerant towards his own race just to show how &#8220;righteous and tolerant&#8221; he is.

<p>Yes, and many of us are wondering why they&rsquo;re not asking for the death penalty.</p>
<p>A white woman tugging on a scarf is charged with a hate crime, but 30 blacks assaulting a white woman on a bus, using racial slurs, are defended by the prosecution and police as just normal crime, while the other rightious prosecutors in the Newsome torture murders are blind to hate crime charges, because one of the blacks had a white girl friend.  And how about the dozens of other hates crimes against whites they let slide?</p>
<p>Great logic, isn&rsquo;t it?  Tea party time yet, for the police and prosecutors?</p>
<p>Our greatest enemies are whites who encourage and protect black misconduct and murder, probably hoping to see more of it occur.</p>

		<p>They always turn a blind eye and a deaf ear when a Muslim attacks and/or kills a white person, but when someone just pulls down a Muslim&rsquo;s scarf, it&rsquo;s a hate crime and unacceptable and could get you up to 3 years in prison.</p>
<p>They think everything whites do always leads to &#8220;hate&#8221;, and they wonder why so many whites are sick and tired of diversity.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;tugging on someone&rsquo;s scarf can now get you three years in prison(if you are white, of course)? I am so glad I live in this &#8220;free country&#8221; filled with &#8220;liberties&#8221; galore and &#8220;justice&#8221; for all. Locking smeone away in a cage for years sounds perfectly reasonable when compared to the horrors of having your scarf tugged on!  </p>

<p>Ridiculous. I don&rsquo;t approve of this type of behavior, no matter who it&rsquo;s committed by (or against), and think she probably deserves to be punished. But $5,000 bail, 3 years imprisonment, a $25,000 fine and loss of civil rights (felony record) for something as minor as this is simply draconian. Back in saner times, she would&rsquo;ve been kicked out of jail the next day with time served and a fine of maybe a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>On another note, if there are any Amrenners who still think that the police and the rest of the criminal justice system are on our side, I hope this story has lifted the scales from your eyes. The police are not our friends and they aren&rsquo;t here to help us. We are now a full-blown anarcho-tyrannical police state, the prison-industrial complex is real, and our elite masters really don&rsquo;t care who is filling those cells as long as they all get filled. </p>

<p>Uh, well, yeah.  Because you don&rsquo;t hear of baptists shooting non-baptists in this country routinely.  You don&rsquo;t hear of Jews shooting non-Jews in this country routinely.  You don&rsquo;t hear about Hindus shooting anybody.  You ONLY hear about MUSLIMS routinely killing non-Muslims while shouting their pagan derived bloodthirsty &#8220;god&#8221; is &#8220;great&#8221;.  So yeah.  When something like this happens, and will happen again, there will be a blacklash.  I live and wait for the day that there will be a BACKLASH which will expel all muslims from this country.  With a black thug carried under each muslim&rsquo;s arm.</p>

		<p>A physical attack upon another person, a total stranger, in a public place, out of the blue and unprovoked,  is simply inexcusable. So I&rsquo;ll not attempt to defend such behavior, which was wrong    &mdash;   even though the anger that caused it might be understandable, especially at that time.</p>
<p>What I WILL criticize is the abject failure of the government to protect its citizens by having a sensible immigration policy, attuned to OUR interests, and its failure even to enforce its own laws.  It is ultimately the government which is to be blamed for this kind of thing, due to the government&rsquo;s unwillingness to do its basic job  - i.e. to guard our borders and ensure domestic tranquility.   This  veiled woman, plus Major Hassan, and the many others like them  <i>should not be here  </i> in the first place.  In other words, there would be no anti-Moslem feeling  among us if there were no Moslems here causing it.  </p>
<p>But unfortunately, when the government fails to do its duty, then individual citizens are left to flail out in meaningless and petty ways such as this.   It is the only way they can make their feelings known when no one else in the seats of power is listening.  It&rsquo;s regrettable, but when the authorities are not doing their jobs, then individuals are left to their own devices. And that&rsquo;s the situation that we have right now.  </p>
<p>As an extension of this concept, when it comes to fighting crime and so many other things, the citizenry are basically left pretty much on their own. Yet, they want to take your arms, so you can&rsquo;t even defend yourselves!  Our government has abdicated its  basic responsibilities to its citizens.   It answers to powerful special interest groups and seems to be more concerned about foreigners than its own people. Indeed, we&rsquo;re so far gone that today&rsquo;s government has lost track of who is &#8220;its own&#8221;, and any mere  reference to such a concept would be construed  as &#8220;racist&#8221;  or  &#8220;nativist&#8221; or &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; &hellip;  three horrible words that we&rsquo;re all trained to recoil from,  like Dracula from a crucifix!      </p>
<p>In the time of Thomas Jefferson or even Theodore Roosevelt, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been the slightest question as to who was  meant by &#8220;our own&#8221;, but  in today&rsquo;s globalist mentality, the President aspires to to be emperor of the world,  while American citizens are brushed aside and forgotten in an attempt to appease everyone else.  As the saying goes, &#8220;everybody&rsquo;s friend is nobody&rsquo;s friend.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I know the topic here, but the main point is we should be long past worrying about hate crimes. We should be focusing on readying ourselves for the coming hostilities. The justice system now is completely compromised against us. To even get upset in any way about this is counterproductive.</p>

		<p>With the Hate Crimes Law that was passed, a minority simply will have to accuse a White person of a hate crime.  I am not advacating anything, but some people are finally going to figure, &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be called a hate crime anyway, I might as well make it count.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Chicago media will make it their business to make sure that everyone knows the name Valerie Kenney. Can anyone from Chicago name ONE of the Fort Hood victims? Can anyone for that matter? All I&rsquo;ve seen about them is a picture of the base showing their portraits. I thought that it would be hard for journalism to hit a new low before Fort Hood, but low and behold, they&rsquo;ve managed to. </p>

		<p>Hate crime laws are ridiculous thought crime laws.  Every black on white and white on black crimes are &#8216;hate crimes.&rsquo;  Simply because you can&rsquo;t prove what a person&rsquo;s train of thought was.  </p>
<p>When you add the fact that only whites are ever prosecuted for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; then it just gets worse.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Every time something like (the Fort Hood shootings) happens, the Muslim community prepares for a backlash&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there should be a backlash from the Native White population, as there is in Muslim countries when they perceive any slight against them or their religion.</p>
<p>Scarf-wearing Muslims have no intention of assimilating and do not belong in this country or any other White-created country based on the tenants of Western Civilizations  &mdash;  especially in light of the fact that our government has chosen to wrongly wage endless wars against third-world Muslim peoples.</p>
<p>As for the &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo;, here is the expected backlash when Muslims perceive an insult from Whites in their country:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A British primary school teacher arrested in Sudan faces up to 40 lashes for blasphemy after letting her class of 7-year-olds name a teddy bear Muhammad&hellip;.<br>
Her colleagues said that they feared for her safety after reports that groups of young men had gathered outside the Khartoum police station where she was taken and were shouting death threats&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2hyc6f</p>
<p>She was only let go after the British government intervened on her behalf and was lucky to escape with her life.</p>
<p>Wonder if any of the &#8216;young men&rsquo; were charged with Hate Crimes.  The stupid White teacher obviously had no understanding of the culture she was living in just as Muslims who migrate to the US have little to no understanding of American culture.  I&rsquo;m sure she was told &#8216;Islam is a religion of peace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Where is Charles Martel when we need him?</p>

		<p>It was a dumb move by a dumb woman, but it was a simple assault with no injury. Summary offense at best, misdemeanor at worst.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The scarf incident was the first of two apparent race-related attacks in Tinley Park in the wake of the Fort Hood shootings, Police Chief Michael O&rsquo;Connell said. On Nov. 8, a Muslim family found racist graffiti on the front of their home, O&rsquo;Connell said. The person rang the family&rsquo;s doorbell but ran off, O&rsquo;Connell said.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, there was one &#8220;hate crime.&#8221; The Muslims painted the graffiti themselves (though no reporter will look too closely into this incident). So the &#8220;anti-Muslim backlash&#8221; amounts to a white woman yanking the scarf of a Muslim women (who, I&rsquo;m sure, didn&rsquo;t antagonize the white woman.)</p>
<p>So 14 people die at the hands of a hate-filled Muslim fanatic and it is not a hate crime. But a white woman wins a fight with a Muslim and there is an epidemic of anti-Muslim hatred.</p>
<p>Typical of Obama&rsquo;s Amerika.</p>

Not even &#8220;Assault&#8221;, which in NY State at least,  requires an injury or the use of a weapon  (or &#8220;instrument&#8221;).  It would be dismissed as merely  &#8220;Harassment&#8221;.    (Ah, but that&rsquo;s without the bias aspect thrown in.  The &#8220;hate&#8221; charge changes everything. I can murder you, as long as I don&rsquo;t  &#8220;hate&#8221; you, and that&rsquo;s not so bad.)  </p>
