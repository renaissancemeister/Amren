<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Louisiana congressman was sentenced to 13 years in prison for abusing his office for financial purposes.</p>
<p>William J. Jefferson, 62, was convicted on August 5 for bribery, racketeering, and illegal business investments.</p>
<p>Jefferson was expected to be sentenced to at least 27 years in prison, as the jury has found him guilty of 11 of 16 counts. However, the sentence turned out to be far less than what was expected by prosecutors.</p>
<p>The investigations started in March 2005. Shortly thereafter at Jefferson&rsquo;s Washington home, FBI agents found USD 90,000 wrapped in aluminum foil in a freezer, which was believed to be a bribe for a high-level Nigerian official  &mdash;  who later denied being involved.</p>
<p>After a six-week trial the jury concluded that between 2000 and 2005, Jefferson has accepted thousands of dollars in bribes from companies that were involved in oil, sugar, communications and other businesses often for projects in Africa.</p>
<p>He also took advantage of his post on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee promote the companies&rsquo; ventures without revealing his own financial interest in the deals.</p>
<p>Robert P. Trout, Jefferson&rsquo;s chief lawyer tried to convince jurors that while the business promotion activities were not wise, they did not qualify as &#8220;official acts&#8221; under public corruption laws, and are therefore not considered a criminal act.</p>
<p>Prosecutors believe that while Jefferson might have sought millions of dollars in bribes, it is possible that he might have actually received less than USD 400,000.</p>
<p>According to The Almanac of American Politics, Jefferson, a Harvard graduate, was the first African American from Louisiana to be elected to Congress since the Black Reconstruction in late 19th century.<br>

		<p>Well, since he&rsquo;s not young and pretty, he&rsquo;s not going to be able to get married while he&rsquo;s in the slammer, so I look for him to convert to a radical jihadist, denouncing the vile white racists who put him behind bars.</p>

		<p>Anonymous, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s correct, what CNN is saying. A conviction would mean a forfeiture of all perks.</p>

		<p>The Nigerian Army has set up a court martial to try some of its officers involved in a fraud that is running into billions of Naira. The fraud said to have been committed between 2006 and this year, is said to be the mother of all frauds in the history of the Army as, according to army sources, some officers and soldiers were involved in gunrunning and selling of arms, ammunition and other weapons to militants in the Niger Delta. About N250million was traced to the account of a serving Major in one of the new generation banks. However, at the centre of the latest billion Naira fraud, is a Brigadier-General, who allegedly used his office as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Army Post-Service Homes Saving and Loans Limited to dupe thousands of applicants for the army post-service housing of billions of Naira. The full amazing story follows&hellip;&hellip;<br>

		<p>Very nice-</p>
<p>Just guessing,but I&rsquo;d say that he was probably receiving some sort of taxpayer monies as a child.</p>
<p>His educations was almost certainly a product of affirmative action,other set-aside programs,and was probably largely,if not entirely,funded by public assistance,grants,and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been sucking on the public teat since he was elected to congress,and I&rsquo;m deliberately not using an uppercase &#8220;C&#8221; when I type that word.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll now get taxpayer funded room and board for the 3 or 4 years he actually spends locked up behind bars.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll get his taxpayer funded pension after he gets turned loose.</p>
<p>Is this a great country????? Where else could this kind of thing happen????</p>

		<p>Sorry, but Soprano Fan is wrong.  Members of Congress who go to prison still get there retirment pay.  Remember the representative from Il., Chicago area I believe  &mdash;  can&rsquo;t recall his name.  He spent 17 months in prison and still got his retirement pay.  But if you are a member of the retired military and go to prison you lose your retirment pay.  Fair, huh?  Just another reason we need term limits.  Maybe in a shorter stay in Congress they won&rsquo;t figure out how to steal.</p>
