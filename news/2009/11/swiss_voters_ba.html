<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8385069.stm">Swiss Voters Back Ban on Minarets</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swiss voters have supported a referendum proposal to ban the building of minarets, official results show.</p>
<p>More than 57% of voters and 22 out of 26 cantons  &mdash;  or provinces  &mdash;  voted in favour of the ban.</p>
<p>The proposal had been put forward by the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, (SVP), the largest party in parliament, which says minarets are a sign of Islamisation.</p>
<p>The government opposed the ban, saying it would harm Switzerland&rsquo;s image, particularly in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>But Martin Baltisser, the SVP&rsquo;s general secretary, told the BBC: &#8220;This was a vote against minarets as symbols of Islamic power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Imogen Foulkes, in Bern, says the surprise result is very bad news for the Swiss government which fears unrest among the Muslim community.</p>
<p>Our correspondent says voters worried about rising immigration  &mdash;  and with it the rise of Islam  &mdash;  have ignored the government&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>In a statement, the government said it accepted the decision.</p>
<p>It said: &#8220;The Federal Council (government) respects this decision. Consequently the construction of new minarets in Switzerland is no longer permitted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said: &#8220;Concerns [about Islamic fundamentalism] have to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, a ban on the construction of new minarets is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sought to reassure Swiss Muslims, saying the decision was &#8220;not a rejection of the Muslim community, religion or culture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Switzerland is home to some 400,000 Muslims and has just four minarets.</p>
<p>After Christianity, Islam is the most widespread religion in Switzerland, but it remains relatively hidden.</p>
<p>There are unofficial Muslim prayer rooms, and planning applications for new minarets are almost always refused.</p>
<p>Supporters of a ban claimed that allowing minarets would represent the growth of an ideology and a legal system  &mdash;  Sharia law  &mdash;  which are incompatible with Swiss democracy.</p>
<p>But others say the referendum campaign incited hatred. On Thursday the Geneva mosque was vandalised for the third time during the campaign, according to local media.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said the vote violated freedom of religion and would probably be overturned by the Swiss supreme court or the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Political symbol&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The president of Zurich&rsquo;s Association of Muslim Organisations, Tamir Hadjipolu, told the BBC: &#8220;This will cause major problems because during this campaign mosques were attacked, which we never experienced in 40 years in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamaphobia has increased intensively.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was dismay among Switzerland&rsquo;s Muslims upon hearing the result.</p>
<p>Farhad Afshar, president of the Coordination of Islamic Organisations in Switzerland, said: &#8220;The most painful thing for us is not the ban on minarets but the symbol sent by this vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elham Manea, co-founder of the Forum for a Progressive Islam, added: &#8220;My fear is that the younger generation will feel unwelcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a message that you are not welcome here as true citizens of this society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s referendum was held after the SVP collected 100,000 signatures from voters within 18 months calling for a vote.</p>
<p>In recent years countries across Europe have been debating how best to integrate Muslim populations.</p>
<p>France focused on the headscarf, while in Germany there was controversy over plans to build one of Europe&rsquo;s largest mosques.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20091130/EU.Switzerland.Minaret.Ban/">Rights Watchdog Hints Swiss Minaret Ban Could Go</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Frank Jordans, Comcast News, November 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A Swiss ban on minarets could violate fundamental liberties, Europe&rsquo;s top human-rights watchdog said Monday in an indication that the heavily criticized vote could be overturned.</p>
<p>The Swiss justice minister also said the European Court of Human Rights could strike down the Sunday vote, which incurred swift condemnation at home and abroad for banning the towers used to put out the Islamic call to prayer.</p>
<p>The 47-nation Council of Europe said that banning &#8220;new minarets in Switzerland raises concerns as to whether fundamental rights of individuals, protected by international treaties, should be subject to popular votes.&#8221; Switzerland presides over the council, which is associated with the European Court of Human Rights. The court rules on breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said the ban would come into force immediately, but indicated that it could be overturned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ban contradicts the European Convention on Human Rights,&#8221; Zurich daily Blick cited Widmer-Schlumpf as saying.</p>
<p>The referendum backed by nationalist parties was approved by 57.5 percent of the population Sunday, forcing the government to declare illegal the building of any new minarets in Switzerland. It doesn&rsquo;t affect the country&rsquo;s four existing minarets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.N.&rsquo;s special investigator on religious freedom, Asma Jahangir, said the ban on new minarets constitutes &#8220;a clear discrimination against members of the Muslim community in Switzerland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, called the ban an &#8220;example of growing anti-Islamic incitement in Europe by the extremist, anti-immigrant, xenophobic, racist, scare-mongering ultra-right politicians who reign over common sense, wisdom and universal values.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wealthy Arab tourists might think twice now about spending their money in Geneva and other Swiss cities popular with visitors from the Gulf, and the neutral country&rsquo;s efforts to mediate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could also suffer, said Daniel Warner, a Swiss-American political scientist at the Graduate Institute in Geneva.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of the ban said the number of Muslims in Switzerland had grown sharply from 50,000 in 1980, but it is still only 4 percent of the 7.5 million population, many of whom don&rsquo;t practice. Western Europe has an estimated 14 million Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, fellow town resident Anton Seil told APTN that &#8220;we are in Switzerland, and if I go to another country I also can&rsquo;t build up my church or represent my faith. So, they have to adapt to us in Switzerland too.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s deja-vu all over again! Already PC losers and Islamist thugs threaten national and international court cases against this measure. Shades of America&rsquo;s critarchy. I believe Bisamrck&rsquo;s adage, &#8220;the great issues of the day are not resolved by words, but by blood and steel&#8221; is apt here. Clearly when people, who just weeks ago were silent about am &#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; shouting mass murderer, spout off over a voting outcome they despise there is no room for comrpomise. For  Muslims, whatever their public stance, it is our way or war. Islam&rsquo;s actions from the start put the lie to all other interpretations.</p>

		<p>Hurrah for the the Swiss!  At least one European country has the courage to stand up to the Muslim world&rsquo;s intention to make Europe, America, and the rest of the &#8220;infidel world&#8221; entirely Muslim!</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if Great Britain, France, Germany and the other European countries would also have the courage to stand up to the coming Muslim threat to Europe, America, and the rest of Western Civilization.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Muslims do not feel accepted as a religious community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; Why should they, do they make Christians, Jews, and others as well as non-believers welcomed in their nation&rsquo;s of origin?</p>
<p>Elham Manea, co-founder of the Forum for a Progressive Islam, added: &ldquo;My fear is that the younger generation will feel unwelcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; And hopefully yearn for home and and go back to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a message that you are not welcome here as true citizens of this society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; Why are they coming, they have expansive nations of their own already, yet they must be allowed into a fragile, little nation, famous for its culture.  How can that culture not already be seriously challenged for its survival after years of this adulteration.  Call to Islamic prayer to be blasted from minarets all over Switzerland?  How can Arabs and non-ethnic Swiss feel that they are true citizens?  And if they do, doesn&rsquo;t that mean that they are fundamentally changing the country.  Why all of this hypocrisy?  </p>

<p>Well daaaaaahhh!!! I wonder why &#8220;Farhad&#8221; [ where DO they come up with these names ]. So I gather that Christians feel accepted as a religious community in the hell hole you come from.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a message that you are not welcome here as true citizens of this society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re NOT welcome, you&rsquo;re NOT [and never will be] true citizens of Switzerland. Can I move to a Muslim country and be looked upon as a true citizen by the natives. Of course not, nor would I expect it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the vote &hellip;would probably be overturned by the Swiss supreme court or the European Court of Human Rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European court is headquartered in Strasbourg, just north of Switzerland, on the French border with Germany.</p>
<p>Should the court try to oppose the Swiss vote, a Pan-European pro-Swiss demonstration should converge on Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Now is the time to mobilize. As we saw when Ireland voted on the Lisbon treaty, the EU will not take no for an answer.</p>

		<p>Some of the statements in this article border on insanity. For example that this vote has the Swiss Government fearing unrest among Muslims. So&hellip; what? They bow down and give in because they are AFRAID of these people? Then they wonder why the Swiss people refuse to give them any more influence in their Country?</p>
<p>Then,this Widmer-Schlumpf woman trying to reassure the Muslim&rsquo;s that this decision is not a rejection of them or their religion or culture? Actually lady, that is EXCATLY what the Swiss people are saying. Loud and clear I might add. Stop apologizing and giving in, and stand up for what your Country stands for and believs in for once!</p>

<p>We have had success here in Australia with the conservative National / Liberal coalition voting down an economy crippling <br>
Emmissions Trading System { better know as an emmissions taxing scam}. That&rsquo;s been consigned to the bin for the foreseable futureor until such time as the people agree to it. Somehow I don&rsquo;t think they ever will agree as they are now asking some very tricky questions about the costs and outcomes.</p>

<p>Good news courtesy of the horrible awful unspeakable right-wing &#8220;racist&#8221; SVP:57% of Swiss people certified NOT INSANE! Yes, a decisive majority have made it clear that if there&rsquo;s to be any weird throat noises made in Switzerland, those weird throat noises should be from yodeling and not ululating.</p>
<p>From the article: </p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;The BBC&rsquo;s Imogen Foulkes, in Bern, says the surprise result is very bad news for the Swiss government which fears unrest among the Muslim community.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
If the Swiss government fears unrest among the Muslim community, well that sounds to me like all the MORE reason to ban the minarets. Disencourage the local <i>Alpen-Mohammedans</i> from getting too cocky and acting they own the place   &mdash;   you know, like they&rsquo;re already doing in France and Britain. </p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see this referendum repeated in every other country throughout W. Europe! </p>

		<p>&#8220;Supporters of the ban said the number of Muslims in Switzerland had grown sharply from 50,000 in 1980, but it is still only 4 percent of the 7.5 million population, many of whom don&rsquo;t practice. Western Europe has an estimated 14 million Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberal&rsquo;s hipocrisy in perfection: They first acknowledge the rapid growth of muslims, but then downplay the connotation of threat by stating that these numbers are still small. The message that is sent out by this statement is: Let more muslims come in, let them reach a higher percentage of the total population. I bet the ones who make these statements don&rsquo;t know at what percentage they will avoid using the word &#8220;only&#8221;.<br>
Next fallacy: If supposedly many muslims don&rsquo;t practice, why is there a need for mosques and minarets at all?  They shouldn&rsquo;t care about how the Swiss voted if they don&rsquo;t practice.</p>
<p>On another note, the number of muslims in Switzerland according to other sources is 400,000, which in a population of 7.5 million makes not 4%, but &#8220;only&#8221; 5.3%&hellip;</p>

		<p>This shows promise on the part of the Swiss, and renews my hope that this serve as a clarion call to our ancestral people. There was a good reason why our forefathers (obviously mine under 700 years of Moorish rule) sacrificed their persons to keep the Muslims and their death cult out of our lands. Go Swiss!</p>

		<p>While Switzerland is a signatory the the Convention in Europe of Human Rights, it is fiercely independent and will fight any overcoming of this democratically voted for ban by its citizens.  The traety on Human rights has damaged the legal processes in many countries where criminals have been given opreference over victims an there are moves by many politicians to greatly modify some of the draconian terms in the treaty.  We can only hope that they are successful.</p>

		<p>Good on the Swiss for showing some backbone!  They may very well need some of their independent warrior spirit if they are to yet save their country.</p>
<p>Here in Vancouver B.C., a local free entertainment/leftist newsrag ran a commentary by Gwynne Dyre about this event, in which he claims that this vote amongst the Swiss was somehow a deliberate act of provocation against the muslims, as they seem to &#8220;inspire more fear than others&#8221;.  Gee, I wonder why?</p>
<p>I do recall onetime in the past one of his articles being featured here on Amren. (couldn&rsquo;t find it in the archives though)  I believe it was about how the British in the UK should just happily accept multiCULTuralism, and welcome their displacement with open arms!</p>
<p>Anyways, his latest outstanding piece of tripe can be found here:</p>

		<p>Well spoken, Anonymous (#1), in every way.  Prince Von Bismarck&rsquo;s words concerning &#8220;&hellip;. blood and iron&#8221; are among my favorite quotes.  Truer words never have been spoken.  When will the people of the West open their eyes to see this?  It&rsquo;s hard to fathom how, in 138 years since Bismarck had orchestrated the unification of Germany, that nation has succumbed to the wonders of diversity and multiculturalism and has suppressed free speech (and thought) in an attempt to appease these invaders. Soon, the European nations will come to rue the day that they ever joined that abomination called the EU.  Surrendering a nation&rsquo;s  sovereignty to some continental system has to be the blunder among blunders.</p>
<p>I toast the courage and good sense of the Swiss people, and I hope that they have set a precedent for the rest of Europe to follow before it&rsquo;s too late.  I hope the Swiss thumb their noses at the European Court of Human Rights if it tries to interfere in what is clearly a matter for the Swiss people to decide.</p>

		<p>  According to the controlled media, &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; right wing &#8220;extremists&#8221; have pushed through a referendum denying Muslims their basic religious rights. How dare they do such a thing! What about the rights of Jews and Christians in the Muslim countries where the immigrants come from? Saudi Arabia allows only Mosques to be built. Christians and Jews must pray in the privacy of their homes. Egypt puts severe restrictions on the construction of churches; even though Christian Copts are a significant Egyptian minority. In Pakistan there are restrictions on Christians and even Shia Muslims. In recent years both Christians and Shia Muslims have been attacked and their places of worship vandalized or destroyed. The Pakistan government has condemned the attacks but done little to stop them. The last remaining members of the ancient Jewish Community in Yemen have left the country. Has anyone tried to open a Buddhist temple in a Muslim country? So the Swiss are intolerant bigots?</p>

		<p>Well done, Swiss! Switzerland is the last European country with a backbone left, that won&rsquo;t sow the seeds for its own destruction by letting the Muslim hordes invade their country. Wherever they go in the world, muslims try to get a toehold and if you give them an inch, they want a yard. And because of political correctness, they usually get their way. Hundreds of years ago they were stopped cold at the gates of Vienna, and that&rsquo;s where Europeans should draw the line. Thank God there are a few sensible Whites left&hellip;<br>
Stand firm, Switzerland!</p>

		<p>Depending on how things go, we may see an attempt to isolate Switzerland, as was done to Austria a few years ago.  (And heaven forbid what they did to Serbia!) The Swiss, though hardy and stubborn, are very susceptible to outside pressures. Perhaps more so than any other country, they are dependent on international trade, international banking, investment, tourism, etc., etc. International everything! A small country of 7.5 million, they import nearly everything they use, and export nearly everything they produce.  They are also accustomed to an extremely high standard of living which is very vulnerable to boycotts.  If the countries surrounding them (not to mention the whole Islamic world) were to apply pressure, they will have to cave. It should be interesting. Let&rsquo;s hope other European countries will support a fellow European country, instead of taking the other side, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it. Yes, it should be interesting to see who lines up where.</p>

		<p>I am normally an advocate of absolute freedom of speech and religious expression.  But given the nature of the crisis facing Europe (an impending Muslim majority), I have reluctantly concluded the only way for these countries to preserve their basic freedoms and for their people to feel secure in their own cities is to aggressively discourage individuals with anti-Western backgrounds from taking root and propagating.  Ayn Rand&rsquo;s ethics of emergencies apply.</p>

		<p>Switzerland is a proud independent nation that trades with the EU but, wisely, is not a member though surrounded by EU member states. The ultra-liberal European Court of Human Rights is separate from the EU but does have a lot of influence. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that this biased article gives various accounts of how many ordinary Muslims feel but doesn&rsquo;t give a platform to the feelings of the indigenous Swiss. It seems whites don&rsquo;t count &amp; this article smacks of the usual liberal hypocrisy. </p>
<p>The flow of multiculturalism/mass immigration is always one way. Into white-majority countries only. If multiculturalism/mass immigration is so wonderful &amp; beneficial to all then why isn&rsquo;t Islam welcoming tens of millions of Africans or Indians so they can share in the diversity and enrichment? Why don&rsquo;t European liberals accuse Islam of xenophobia for wishing to remain Islamic even when they move to Western nations, but instead pander to Islam. No, multiculturalism/mass immigration is for the destruction of white-majority countries only.</p>

The fact is, Islam is the greatest threat the world faces today, and to let it proliferate in any country that isn&rsquo;t already theirs is to allow them to take over that host country.  We need to FOLLOW the Swiss example   &mdash;   hell, no, Muslims aren&rsquo;t welcome here!  They need to take their phallic minarets and ship &#8216;em home.  Or maybe turn them into large candles, which can burn through the Christmas season.  MUSLIMS GO HOME should be what we in the USA are doing.  We are going to deeply regret it if we don&rsquo;t.  Yes, they will retaliate with jihad, because that&rsquo;s the only way they know how to respond.  We in turn can catch the offenders and dispatch them to their higher good, ASAP.

		<p>Undoubtedly the liberals will celebrate should the Swiss cave under pressure, ignoring the fact that democracy would be violated. If only other European countries and the US were not too big for a system like direct democracy. </p>
<p>For all their hypocrisy, they ought to try to set up a Church in secular Turkey. The state pays for the building and maintenance of mosques. I&rsquo;m not sure about the laws for building a church- or even a synagoge for that matter- but the Turkish bureaucracy is famous among European visitors for being exceptionally annoying. Churcehs in liberal cities, such as Ankara, are hidden away in upper-scale white enclaves and are very modest. Even the Greek Orthodox Church in Istanbul is modest. </p>
<p>I spoke about this issue with a liberal friend (of the unsightly hyper-feminist breed), and she rambled on about how geographic location should not matter. When I brought her back to the issue, told her that there was a need for culture to be preserved, gave her my account in Turkey, and added that a group of (sensible) feminists had led some support to this ruling all I got back was how insecure she thought me to be. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the liberal way? When you can&rsquo;t think of any other rational argument, try the ad hominum route.  </p>
