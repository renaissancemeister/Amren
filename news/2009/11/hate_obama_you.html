<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/nov/16/obama-racism-conservatives-opposition">Hate Obama? You May Not Be A Racist. But You Will Be White</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Tomasky, Guardian (London), November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I was just recalling how, about a year ago, my country was swept up in a spasm of self-congratulation. Not only had Barack Obama broken a seemingly insuperable historical barrier in winning the presidency, the media told us, but &#8220;we&#8221; had as well. We had overcome centuries of gruesome history and proved to the world that America could live up to its promise.</p>
<p>The US press in those days duly reported but tended to downplay events that told the opposite story. The footnote, for instance, that the white supremacist website stormfront.org temporarily went dead on 5 November, the day after the election, because it was so inundated with requests for membership. And the tale about the Maine convenience store that started an &#8220;Osama Obama Shotgun Pool&#8221; inviting customers to bet on the date Obama would be shot, and saying: &#8220;Let&rsquo;s hope we have a winner&#8221;.</p>
<p>These were treated as isolated events, and maybe they were. The important thing was the people had spoken, and they&rsquo;d given proof that America wasn&rsquo;t that kind of country any more.</p>
<p>A year later, we&rsquo;ve seen an epidemic of hatred against the president that I think is safe to call unprecedented. Bill Clinton and George W Bush were hated  &mdash;  but not quite like this. When we have a pastor, a real-live Baptist minister in Arizona, devoting a sermon to explaining why the president should &#8220;melt like a snail&#8221; (and he was explicit  &mdash;  he meant Obama should be killed), we&rsquo;ve reached a new point. Obama, it was reported over the summer, receives 30 death threats a day, three or four times the number issued against Bush. And I think it can&rsquo;t be just a coincidence that you will almost never see him give a speech out of doors, the middle of a heavily guarded military base (Fort Hood) providing a recent and rare exception.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about race as a motivator for these kinds of things in this country. There are some decent reasons why. First, it&rsquo;s said, the anger felt towards Obama  &mdash;  among the &#8220;tea party&#8221; contingent, for instance  &mdash;  is in the main ideological. Let me be clear: I agree with this. It is in the main ideological. What a lot of the rest of us see as salvaging hundreds of thousands of jobs and averting a far deeper crisis by taking steps to bail out General Motors, Chrysler, Citigroup and Bank of America, they see as socialism. Fine. It&rsquo;s a free country, as we like to say.</p>
<p>Second, race is hard to talk about because it&rsquo;s unquantifiable. If an incident occurs that looks as if it might be a hate crime but contains shadings of ambiguity, we can&rsquo;t say, &#8220;Well, that act had roots that were 61% economic and 39% racial&#8221;. Likewise with Obama hatred. And if something can&rsquo;t be measured, it&rsquo;s hard even to argue about, let alone agree on.</p>
<p>And third, I do think it&rsquo;s fair to say that, at this point in US history, most individuals aren&rsquo;t racist, at least in any blatant way. Most white people, especially from middle age down, may have a black friend or two, or at least co-workers with whom they get along fine. When conservatives complain that they feel they can&rsquo;t make criticisms of Obama without being called racist, they have a point, and on an individual level I have some sympathy with them.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing that most media discussions of race miss. It has to do with the difference between the individual and the crowd.</p>
<p>The tea partiers are about 98% white. I went to the 12 September tea party march at the Capitol building. I saw many thousands of people. I spotted about a half dozen Asians, three or four Latinos, and one black person. All the rest were white. Look at the videos from the town halls over the summer. Virtually all of the angry people are white. Look, indeed, at the Republican party. It&rsquo;s almost entirely white. Yes, Michael Steele, a black man, is its chairman. But he was obviously a strategic and even cynical choice (made after Obama was elected) and was not culled from the ranks of numerous available black Republicans, because in truth there are hardly any.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that it is a central article of faith for American conservatism that the whole business of diversity is nothing but a racket, forced on them by liberal elites. I can&rsquo;t think of one measure meant to ameliorate America&rsquo;s hideous history of racial discrimination that conservatives have supported. Literally not one, in the 50 years we&rsquo;ve been trying them.</p>
<p>This is the Obama-hating crowd. It&rsquo;s deeply conservative, and it&rsquo;s about 98% white. And the thing about crowds is that they develop a personality of their own that is not merely the sum of individual parts. A crowd is an organism that grows in its own way and tends to be led and excited by its extremes. It can mutate into being racist without many or even most of the individuals in it being so.</p>
<p>It can be a danger, as we&rsquo;re often reminded, to overstate these things without that magical &#8220;proof&#8221; we&rsquo;re always looking for. But the greater danger rests in understating them. Americans resist overstatement because we want to reassure ourselves we&rsquo;re a good country at heart. But history has more often proved on this topic that we&rsquo;re not. We&rsquo;d do well not to forget that.<br>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t about how black Obama is (remember he&rsquo;s also WHITE) but how RED he is.<br>
Of course, communists and socialists are incapable of seeing this fact.<br>
It&rsquo;s easier and more expedient to their goals to use the label &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I think the reason President Obama won&rsquo;t speak outdoors is because he doesn&rsquo;t want to have protestors and the imagery of masses of protesters to lower the morale of those pushing his agenda.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a free country to oppose bailout but not a free country for whites to resist their forced displacement?</p>

<p>Not that I would expect someone whose screed appears in the UK Guardian to know this, but there are many types of conservatism. There is the &#8220;conservatism&#8221; of George Wallace, which did oppose those things, then there is the &#8220;conservatism&#8221; of Richard Nixon, which/who started affirmative action enforcement in the Federal government, then there is the &#8220;conservatism&#8221; of Ronald Reagan, who eliminated PACE so that incompetent black women with useless affirmative action college degrees could flood the Federal bureaucracy, and Reagan signed South Africa&rsquo;s death warrant, MLK birthday as a Federal holiday, and so on.</p>

		<p>A great deal of anti-Obama sentiment is caused by knee-jerk accusations from the left that any criticism of him is rooted in racism.  A man of barely any Presidential credentials, he was chosen by his party as the First African-American President and shoved down Democrats throats.  Moreover, all racism is presented as hatred, as is so-called homophobia.  People can&rsquo;t simply believe that certain ethnicities have, on the average, higher intellect, or they can&rsquo;t disapprove of the conduct of a particular group without being labeled haters.    </p>

		<p>apologies for no cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not certain of this&hellip;but i believe i am. the percentage of the black population that voted for obama hovers at around 99 percent contrary to the media&rsquo;s figure of 96 percent. virtually every black man and woman in this country voted for obama. even colin powell admitted he voted for obama after all the republicans - particularly the bushes - have done for him all these years. <br>
some voted that had never voted before. and, thanks to groups like a.c.o.r.n., there were probably many votes cast multiple times and people who don&rsquo;t exist got a chance to vote. voter fraud was more rampant than i have ever witnessed. the election may have literally been &#8221;stolen&#8221; if the full truth be known.<br>
 <br>
to list the outrageous things that have occurred since obama took office would be longer than the lastest version of the universal health care btll that harry reid backs. i - having attended two tea parties - have not heard anything about obama&rsquo;s race mentioned at all in our all-white gatherings. the attitude and outrage seems to be directed at how radically he is disassembling the u.s. and her constitution. at how his appointments have been shady at best and outright revolutionary and communist at worst. the general attitude of most i met is simply that he is a radical who is in a position he never should have assumed and that he is plunging us into debt worse and faster than any president in history. many are concerned about his apologizing for the u.s. while abroad and that his behavior is condescending toward this country. many believe he and his cadre are fifth columnists and traitors intent on destroying america and reshaping it with a soviet twist. still others are &#8221;birthers&#8221; who are concerned that he was born in kenya and that his birth certificate is merely a forged &#8221;certificate of live birth&#8221; and not official. this i must say&hellip;this man has not produced an adequate birth certificate from the state of hawaii. additionally, his grandmother and other family members attest he was born in kenya and even cite the hospital where it occurred.<br>
still others are concerned of the inflation that is sure to come and are running scared as their retirement portfolios shrink.</p>
<p>whatever the outcome, the next three years promise to be a wild ride.  </p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re white, your  motives are suspect and your opinions don&rsquo;t count, unless you toe the left&rsquo;s party line. That&rsquo;s the bottom line in post-racial America. Recall loony Howard Dean&rsquo;s dismissal of the &#8220;other&#8221; party as illegitimate because of it&rsquo;s being comprised of whites and Christians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year later, we&rsquo;ve seen an epidemic of hatred against the president that I think is safe to call unprecedented. Bill Clinton and George W Bush were hated &mdash; but not quite like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funny, what a short memory these utterly worthless and abjectly godless Reds have!</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, didn&rsquo;t some demented &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; running as a Democrat for the U?S Congress out in California call for Comrade General Secretary Bush&rsquo;s assassination, and the rape and murder of both his daughters by &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; in 2004? And that was just for not granting an amnesty to the &ldquo;undocumented,&rdquo; that he would have gladly and giddily issued an edict for had it not been superseded by that pesky inhibitor of marauding multiculturalism, The Constitution of the United States.</p>

		<p>Again I ask, just what do they expect. To get him elected they promised that he could walk on water and raise the dead. He didn&rsquo;t really have to live up to these grand expectations but he did need to do something more than an unpopular health care idea. </p>
<p>Obama would be setting in the cat-bird seat if any troops had come home, wars ended or the economy showed any signs of improvement. That&rsquo;s the trouble with wearing the laurels of victory before the battle, people may expect more than just talk. </p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about the 99 vs 96 percent thing.  Officials like to look at the fact that 96 percent of the votes in the black part of town went to Obama, ignoring the fact that there are a few whites left there   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s where the non-Obama votes came from.</p>

<p>In other words, if whites won&rsquo;t get on board with their own dispossession, they&rsquo;re &#8220;racist.&#8221;  What will these folks do when &#8220;racist&#8221; becomes a compliment?  Gin up a new word, I suppose.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, though.  90%+ of blacks are Obama supporters.  So unless whites are 90%+ Obama supporters too, we&rsquo;re vulnerable to the author&rsquo;s (implied) definition of racism.</p>
<p>Of course, don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the author to point out that the 55/45 split in the white vote (or whatever the split was) between Obama and McCain vs. the 90/10 split in the black vote (or whatever) is &#8220;evidence&#8221; that blacks are far more racist than whites.</p>
<p>Which is more or less a rule for the media, which means they&rsquo;re vulnerable to charges of bias, maybe even racism against whites.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>

		<p> Typical, isn&rsquo;t it, that the only time a White liberal columnist refers to his fellow Caucasians as &#8220;we&#8221; is when he&rsquo;s condemning them for being &#8220;racist&#8221;? And why is it that, if a Muslim officer yelling &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; kills a bunch of non-Muslim soldiers with a gun, the establishment hems and haws about whether he is a terrorist, or just &#8220;a guy who snapped under the pressure&#8221;?</p>
<p> &#8220;We,&#8221; to use Mr. Tomasky&rsquo;s word, don&rsquo;t get cut any slack like that. If a group of protesters is 98 percent White, we&rsquo;re automatically &#8220;racists&#8221; preaching &#8220;hatred.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it. I DO hate him. </p>
<p>And for good reason- my religion commands me to&hellip;</p>
<p>Do I not hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee? And am I not grieved with them that rise up against Thee?  I hate Thy Enemies, O LORD, with a Perfect Hatred-  I count them my enemies&rdquo; -Psalm 139: 21-22</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live in peace not only with your friends, but also with your enemies; But only with your personal enemies,  and not with the enemies of God.&rdquo; – St. Theodosius of the Kiev Caves Lavra</p>
<p>I consider Obama to be an enemy of God, pure and simple. In that light, I guess the author of this piece is correct..but only  as far as the FIrst Amendment guarantees that right of mine to be upheld- which holds, only as long as Obama is still treating his reign as a President, and not an &#8216;Emperor Jones&rsquo;&hellip;and upholding the Constitution- umm, didn&rsquo;t he swear to uphold it? Or did we miss something in that hidden ceremony &#8216;double-take&rsquo; later on in the day, his first day in office?</p>

		<p>Yeah um, the article is actually being dishonest.</p>
<p>A fact that should sober Obama is that his approval rating among BLACKS started out at 98%.  It has dropped under 70%.</p>
<p>Blacks may be racist.  But Obama is so bad that even THAT won&rsquo;t keep them supporting him.</p>
<p>Put another way, black solidarity goes out the window when there is no food on the table.</p>

		<p><i>This is the Obama-hating crowd. It&rsquo;s deeply conservative, and it&rsquo;s about 98% white. And the thing about crowds is that they develop a personality of their own that is not merely the sum of individual parts. A crowd is an organism that grows in its own way and tends to be led and excited by its extremes. It can mutate into being racist without many or even most of the individuals in it being so.</i></p>
<p>That holds true for every other race.  And the other races are pretty damn blatant about it.  But Tomasky&rsquo;s fear and/or loathing of American whites blinds him to this reality.  To his credit he at least lives amidst the diversity he preaches (Silver Spring, Maryland).  But it just doesn&rsquo;t follow that if whites &#8220;stop being racist&#8221; so will every other race and kumbaya will result.  </p>

		<p>So we are supposed to believe that white Conservatives(are thee honestly any other kind in numbers worth noting?)hate Obama, not because he is easily the most unapologetically left-wing president the country has ever had, but merely because he&rsquo;s (half)black? Funny thing when pure identity politics comes up against idology like this - suddly the left/right paradigm is forgotton and it&rsquo;s ALL about race. How informative&hellip; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the media lately is increasingly making it a point to mention that conservative meetings, rallies, etc. are &#8220;overwhelmingly white.&#8221;  Chris Matthews at MSNBC said this about a Palin book signing event.  This is the Left&rsquo;s new strategy - imply that, in this &#8220;diverse&#8221; nation, no viewpoint is legitimate unless there are enough minorities who support it.  Since minorities are overwhelmingly liberal, any viewpoint that is slightly to the right of center will be deemed &#8220;divisive&#8221;, &#8220;polarizing&#8221;, etc.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t advocate anyone &#8220;hating&#8221; Obama if &#8220;hating&#8221; means making death threats. But notice how this writer goes from talking about such threats to whining about strong criticisms of Obama. </p>
<p>The writer doesn&rsquo;t say where he gets the figure that Obama gets &#8220;three or four times&#8221; the number of threats that Bush got. I don&rsquo;t buy it. Bush was the instigator of an extremely unpopular war. I don&rsquo;t see that Obama gets anywhere near the amount of criticism and vitriol that Bush got, so why would death threats be any different? </p>
<p>As far as the most strident demonstrators against Obama being white, this says less about white willingness to criticize Obama than black refusal to do so. </p>
<p>I hope the white resistance against Obama only continues to grow. It will help to illustrate the strong racial divide in this country and may even wake some whites up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The tea partiers are about 98% white. I went to the 12 September tea party march at the Capitol building&hellip; All the rest were white. Look at the videos from the town halls over the summer. Virtually all of the angry people are white. Look, indeed, at the Republican party. It&rsquo;s almost entirely white.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that the less black people involve theyselves, the more it&rsquo;s white people&rsquo;s fault for being so doggone, um, participatory.  Black people don&rsquo;t vote, they don&rsquo;t go to school, they don&rsquo;t work and they aren&rsquo;t civically minded.  Does that reflect badly upon them?  Somehow, no&hellip;</p>

<p>This is not a criticism.  You might start checking garage sales in your area.  You might find the replacement keyboard you need.  I happened on a Canon BJ-200 printer.  Didn&rsquo;t know that I needed it but they were willing to let me have it for free.  I went ahead and paid them 50 cents for it.</p>
<p>Also post a few 3&#8221; by 5&#8221; index cards on the bulletin boards at laundromats and the like.  Leave you name and number and that you are looking for a free keyboard.  What cost do you have in that?  Time and a few pennies for the cards and thumb-tack.</p>
<p>My local computer repair guy is always throwing out into the trash older computers that are not worth repairing.  Check with a repair guy and let him know what you are looking for.  </p>
<p>You should be able to score a keyboard for a song using one of the above methods.  There are a godzillion used keyboards out there.  You&rsquo;ll find one&hellip;</p>

		<p>As I told many people, during the election last year, I wasn&rsquo;t voting for Obama because he was black, hell I didn&rsquo;t vote for Reagan or Bush because they were white, I was voting against his belief system, his ideology and his associations. If a white democrat had won the nomination, with the same core belief system as Obama, I would have voted against him too.  And Barrack Obama has turned out to be exactly as I knew he would, a left of center politician, totally unqualified for the presidency with radical beliefs that are abhorrent to the majority of Americans.  </p>
<p>Obama won the election due to the majority of white liberals and moderates who wanted to be viewed as non-racist.  Voting for Obama was trendy and although some will say it is racist, he won the presidency because of affirmative action. Voting for Obama was a vote against anything like Bush.  John McCain wasn&rsquo;t much better but Obama and his beliefs are so totally the opposite of everything I believe.</p>

<p>Michael Tomasky: &#8220;&hellip; We&rsquo;ve seen an epidemic of hatred against the president that I think is safe to call unprecedented.&#8221; </p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Tomasky is lip-synching the socialist-Democrats&rsquo; favorite song. For starters, the left-wing extremists who dominate the country have succeeded to the point that they define the terms to suit themselves. Thus, &#8220;hate&#8221; means whatever the far left says it means at any given time, and the label &#8220;hateful&#8221; is applied only very selectively as a political tool. Proof of this is in the fact that virtually every utterance of disapproval expressed toward Barack Hussein Obama is automatically labeled &#8220;hate.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a double whammy that opposition to Obama&rsquo;s extremism can be defined as &#8220;racial hatred.&#8221; </p>
<p>To liken a political opponent to a Nazi and a lynch-mob leader, however, does not qualify as hateful &hellip; as long as the political opponent is conservative. </p>
<p>Second, the harshest attacks on Obama have been like &#8220;the tale about the Maine convenience store&#8221; that Tomasky cites: They&rsquo;ve involved individuals or small groups. On the other hand, I have heard Republicans (and especially conservatives) reviled endlessly through major corporate news and entertainment sources and by popular-culture figures without that evidently having upset anyone&rsquo;s delicate sensibilities. </p>
<p>Third, only the most limp-wristed commentator would dare to express concern about the supposed hatred directed toward Obama without mentioning the other side &mdash; the wild-eyed hyperventilating worship of &#8220;the first African-American president&#8221; that has been so prominently on display for at least a couple of years now. </p>
<p>Between &#8220;hate&#8221; as defined by left-wing extremists and fanatical adulation such has been shown toward Barack Hussein Obama, the latter is the more dangerous by far. </p>

		<p>Why was Obama even elected in the first place? Personally, I suspect that the (very childish) reason that he was elected is psychologically the same as this; back when I was in high school (I graduated in 1971 from a Catholic high school), my classmates were to vote for a homecoming queen. We had several good candidates, all very good looking white girls (come on now, really, what other criteria is there in a high school senior boys eyes for a homecoming queen?). Now, you need to know that in our high school class, ALL the students, except for one lone black girl, were white. This black girl was a homely looking tall, thin thing and NO male would give her a second glance. But, yes, you guessed it SHE was elected home coming queen! Why??<br>
Nearly all the males that I spoke with back then were as agast and confused as I was. Well, it turns out that nearly all the girls in the class (and there were more girls than boys in our high school class) had voted for the black girl. And the reason?<br>
They wanted &#8220;our high school class to be the first one to have a black homecoming queen&#8221;.</p>

		<p>According to one comment, Mr. Tomasky lives in Silver Spring, MD - an increasingly Latino/Black community on the edges of heavily Liberal Montgomery County, Maryland.  His hostility to Christian Whites, therefore, is completely understandable.  He isn&rsquo;t one, in fact, and identifies far more with the &#8220;minority&#8221; viewpoint against historic White, Anglo-Saxon culture.  All liberal, mainstream press criticism of conservative gatherings (Tea Parties, Palin book signings, what have you) prominently note that the attendees are mainly White.  It&rsquo;s the equivalent of screaming &#8220;GUILTY.  RACISM BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN WHITE.  HATER BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN WHITE.&#8221;  Conversely, I read a post recently (can&rsquo;t remember where) by a Black woman with a typical phony double-barreled name who recently attended a Corzine rally in N.J. with Barack Obama - and she carefully noted that the crowd was far less &#8220;diverse&#8221; than crowds she remembered from the 08 campaign - i.e. only BO&rsquo;s home boys came out to cheer him this time.  </p>
<p>Essentially, I don&rsquo;t give a damn.  Fine, I&rsquo;m a hater.  Yes, I&rsquo;m a racial realist.  Yes, I&rsquo;m White and conservative and Christian.  No, Mr. Tomasky, I don&rsquo;t play your game and I don&rsquo;t quail before your labels and yes, I do  hate BO.</p>

		<p>I may be going out on a limb here saying this, but I am sorta glad that we elected a black guy. </p>
<p>Why? Because of all the other westernized countries, a majority white population (USA) felt comfortable and confident enough to elected a member of one of its minority groups to lead us. </p>
<p>What other westernized country can say that? Have we seen a British Indian elected Prime Minister, a German Turk elected Chancellor, or an Irish Protestant elected Prime Minister? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Because other countries, western or not have a history of slaughtering, disenfranchising their minorities or beating them down so far they will never be culturally mature enough to hold higher positions.</p>
<p>My problem is not with the color of Obama&rsquo;s Black skin, but the color of his Red politics. </p>
<p>I would be happy to have a Black President, if he (or she) were Conservative or and Republican. </p>
<p>With his politics being so Red, he will be our first Black President and probably our last Black President. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the UK and Germany aren&rsquo;t non-white enough yet.  After Obama got elected, there were several articles in several UK papers about how both the Tories and Labour want to rush non-whites to the frontbench and eventually have a minority lead one of them, so that a non-white would become Prime Minister.  The exact quote I read in several instances was that the UK needed to find &#8220;our Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are hardly any Protestants in Ireland.  Even Northern Ireland, part of the UK, is MAJORITY Protestant but something like 40% Catholic.  But Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants are both Irish.  You can prove ethnicity, you can&rsquo;t prove faith.  Northern Ireland should have never left Ireland, I blame the Protestants in that matter, in spite of being one myself.  </p>
<p>How do the UK, Ireland and Germany have a history of &#8220;slaughtering&#8221; their internal domestic racial minorities?  When they never had any outside the British Empire and Germany&rsquo;s scant few African possessions they didn&rsquo;t hold for long?</p>

<p>Comfort and confidence have nothing to do with it.  America, unlike other Western nations is in the advanced stage of demographic transition.  Forty percent of Obama&rsquo;s votes came from non-Whites while the bulk of the White votes came from the non-productive part of our population (government workers, disability pensioners, welfare moochers, etc.) or people who are trying to destroy the country (marxists, communists, etc.).  Does it ever occur to you that these minorities will slaughter, disenfranchise or beat down people like you (assuming your White) when they get total control of this country?  We are already getting a taste of it but just imagine when Whites are a minority. Your treating his election as something to be proud of when in actuality it is a symbol of the decay and the eventual end of America.</p>

		<p>To Casualty of Hope and Change, in regard to:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his politics being so Red, he will be our first Black President and probably our last Black President.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With my tongue firmly in my cheek, I must point out that Comrade General Secretary Obama is our second black president; the first &ldquo;black president&rdquo; was Comrade General Secretary Clinton. Now Comrade General Secretary Bush 43 can probably be called our first &ldquo;Latino president,&rdquo; but here I digress only a bit. </p>
<p>The point that I am making is this: be very careful about forgetting that Neo Con Republicans are as bad, if not worse than, the Neo Marxist Democrats. They both worship at the alter of multiculturalism, which is only a rainbow dissection table that has been soaked by so many crimson shades of white America&rsquo;s blood for the last 60 years, that it is now transformed into a monochromatic Red uniformity of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and &ldquo;propriety.&rdquo; It is a Red uniformity based on a siren&rsquo;s song about &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; that makes Stalin&rsquo;s and Mao&rsquo;s genocidal utopia propaganda look like a nursery rhyme in comparison. </p>
<p>Comrade Obama is only the beginning of what will be a rather dark Red future for this country and its (current majority) white citizens, should we not demand that our majority status be preserved. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, please consider the example of post-Apartheid South Africa &ldquo;majority ruled&ldquo; ANC South Africa. To be sure, this is a widely misunderstood and unpopular view of Apartheid in that country, but it was a sociopolitical system meant to preserve Western Civilization and maintain a tenuous white majority country, with Bantustans or Tribal Homelands running as the administrative and cultural entities for eventual black self &ldquo;rule&rdquo; within them. In short, they were theoretically supposed to &ldquo;function,&rdquo; like Indian reservations do hear in the USA. </p>
<p>Instead, what you have now is the foolishly maudlin and ignorantly applauded &ldquo;New South Africa,&rdquo; which is slowly sinking into a quick Red quagmire politically and a gradual socioeconomic new Stone Age. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, do a Google search on anti-white crimes and/or political instability in the &ldquo;New South Africa.&rdquo; Both will be things you will never see in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media of this country, and brace yourself for it. It is ugly and it is horrid what is going on there.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself, if this is what you want for your children and grandchildren,</p>

Yeah, yeah, more volunteer head-shrinkery by liberal eggheads. Nothing is what it seems if it doesn&rsquo;t jive with PC   &mdash;   it can be explained away in a million ways, all it takes is one NEW WORLD ORDERLY and a century&rsquo;s worth of trial and error in the brainwashing of the masses to slather one more layer of nonsense on. </p>
<p>Marx was all about economic class conflict and polarization, ostensibly in the name of abolishing economic class differences. The above commentary is a perfect example of the adaptation of Marx&rsquo;s scheme in the ex-white world to as a a means to strategic IDENTITY-GROUP class conflict and polarization. That means mostly racial groups, of course   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re so nice and neat to work with, everything&rsquo;s color-coded!</p>
<p>The patently angry and hateful tone ***of Tomasky&rsquo;s article*** means another of the System&rsquo;s attack dogs, i.e. an opinioneer at a large System newspaper, is snarling at whitey to get back in his cell and resume taking his TV-pills every morning and night.

		<p>For those of you who read and/or post comments on this site, read and HEED what John PM, comment #41, says above.  John, you really hit the nail on the head, much more so that I could have. As I have done many times in the past, and will continue to do, I refer back to what George Wallace said back in 1968, which BTW is when I was in Vietnam, when he said there was not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the Democrat and Republican parties.  A look back into history should confirm this without any doubt.  The powers that be control BOTH sides of the political spectrum, and the Republican vs. Democrat is just the means they have perfected to control and confuse the public when it comes to politics.  At the grass roots level, there really are differences between the 2 parties, but the further up the food chain you go they become closer and closer, until at some point they merge.  This is why the PTB fear a strong third party, unless, of course, they get control of it. A strong, REAL third party would offer a real choice of candidates, instead of having to chose between socialist party A and socialist party B, as has been for all these years.  Just the last election should illustrate this.  What real choice was there between Obama and McCain?  And what choice was there between Bush and Gore, and on and on?  THINK ABOUT IT!!!</p>

     Well, I just had to add this comment because I&rsquo;ve never seen such ignorance even on an online forum before. My mother was born in Germany (in Augsburg, in 1914) and she remembers the country very well. Prior to WW2, there were NO &#8220;PEOPLE OF COLOR&#8221; as they like to refer to themselves, to be &#8220;slaughtered, disenfranchised, or beaten down&#8221; as you so dimwittedly put it. Germany was a lily-white country throughout its history prior to WW2.You could only get to see a black man (&#8220;in living color&#8221;, lol) at the circus when it came to town. After WW2, there was a large influx of Turks and other muslim types, supposedly to &#8220;bring in guest workers because the German people did not want to do certain types of work&#8221;, which is just so much propaganda because these &#8220;people of color&#8221; were forced on them just as the Mexicans are being forced on us here now. So how do you come to the conclusion that Western countries (and you specifically include Germany) have a &#8220;history&#8221; of &#8220;mistreating&#8221; these people when there never were colored people of any type living there in their entire history up until just 60 years ago? And by the way, I don&rsquo;t have a problem &#8220;with the color of Obama&rsquo;s skin&#8221; either, I just have a problem with the way black people BEHAVE (caps for emphasis, not for shouting) and consequently, I, and a lot of other white people who know what is in store for us when the country becomes a majority of non-whites do not want to live among those non-whites. If you do not have a problem with a black president then maybe you should try living in a country where blacks rule.Go to South Africa, and if the blacks there let you live long enough, maybe you can come back and tell us how you liked the experience-Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget to make sure you have a good alarm system in your home and the &#8220;rape room&#8221;- a panic room- like the other whites who live there do. That is a special room that the family&rsquo;s women can run into and lock themselves in when the gangs of blacks come over the perimeter walls at night.</p>

When Obama was elected, I accepted it. I thought, let&rsquo;s give him the opportunity to show he can be a great president. <br>
I am very disappointed. <br>
It it not race, it is experience, action, and honesty. In my opinion, he has demonstrated that he is not qualified to have this position. His experience in the Senate was very limited, and it is beginning to become more evident.&#8221;</p>

Sandi, I&rsquo;m a conservative too but I realize that in the end it didn&rsquo;t matter if McCain/Palin won or Obama.  I like Palin&rsquo;s social conservatism but she&rsquo;s nothing except a neocon wrapped in a pretty package.  Alot of Whites no doubt voted for Obama because he promised to end those useless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and now they realize they&rsquo;ve been duped.  The same people who pulled Bush&rsquo;s strings also pull Obama&rsquo;s.  Our hostile alien elites sense 2012 will be the biggest defeat in an election since Jimmy Carter.  Now they&rsquo;re cranking up the MSM to promote Palin using their usual cunning and crafty techniques.  I saw an article that says only racists support Palin in an attempt to rally people to her side.  It&rsquo;s utterly laughable, as I&rsquo;m a racist myself and I wouldn&rsquo;t support her if she was running against Kamau Kambon.  Sandi open your eyes and don&rsquo;t let yourself fall into the same old neocon traps.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re analyzing the 2008 Presidential elections through your own anti-war (and probably anti-Semitic) rose colored glasses.  Just because a candidate who mouthed off about being against Iraq and Afghanistan won (even though we both know it was all fake) doesn&rsquo;t mean the average voter was thinking about Iraq and Afghanistan, and doesn&rsquo;t mean that most voters are as obsessively against as you or mildly against as me.  </p>
<p>Lamestream conservatives like Rush Limbaugh also fall into this trap, that is, being too self-important about one&rsquo;s own ideology to think that almost every voter is nothing more than a robotic lamestream conservative voting that way, or not voting at all if neither candidate tows the Limbaughian line.</p>
<p>Barack Obama won for two reasons and two reasons only:  (1) The economy, and (2) He was more likeable than John McCain.  A UCLA study last year shows that people usually vote their pocketbooks, and usually vote for the more likeable candidate.  Worse than that, people don&rsquo;t vote for candidates whose ideas they like, they adopt certain ideas because they personally like the candidate espousing them.  </p>

		<p>I think the people who more and more state we have the usual suspects posting here to try and veer discussions off track or to make statements they hope will stick in the minds of newcomers or the unwary are correct. Take #47 for example. To put it simply, the writer of the article about the Hate Obama crowd is criticized for his remarks and hypocrisy, and out comes the old canards like &#8220;probably anti-Semitic&#8221;, too self-important about one&rsquo;s own ideology and of course &#8220;rose colored glasses&#8221; among others because no one who against the thoroughly evil Bolsheviks now in charge is capable of looking at things clearly. So they wish.</p>
<p>BHO won the election because of the economy, period, not because of being more likeable. In fact, the way things are these days, where the US is basically more and more like the old USSR, it&rsquo;s likely the election was fixed from the start, and McCain pulled stunts like the Sarah Palin selection as running mate to make sure he&rsquo;d be more likely to lose should things go &#8220;wrong&#8221;. In order to please his masters. The same people pulling BHO&rsquo;s puppet strings. </p>
<p>The adoption of ideas is generally based on level of intelligence coupled with personal experience. Groups like the less intelligent voted for BHO simply because the bulk of the less intelligent are not whites. White college students voted for BHO after being ground down from k-12 + brainwashing that has resulted in their inability to distinguish between fact and propaganda, never mind their eroded critical thinking abilities and the silly fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221;. The more intelligent non-whites, including Asians, voted for BHO because a) they tend to vote Democrat at increasingly higher rates each election cycle, realizing they benefit from the racial spoils system and b) voting for BHO was a vote against Whites, plain and simple. All non-whites favored BHO by large margins. Overall, BHO did not get a majority of the White vote. So the Lamestream Leftist Puppets will have to fine tune their arguments, and come up with several more disingenuous and skewed studies to prove their pointless points. </p>

		<p>48:  Obama may not have gotten a majority of the white vote, but he got enough votes from working class whites in enough important swing states (read: OH) and some surprise states (read: IN) to win.  By the time 2012 comes along, the Republican will need probably about 58% of the white vote to win, and with a persistent gender gap, that means 62% of white men and 54% of white women.  If the economy keeps tanking, the Republican might win in 2012 in spite of him/herself.  </p>
<p>Bush barely won in 2000, with 54% of the white vote.  McCain lost in 2008 with 55% of the white vote.</p>

		<p>Fact is, black people don&rsquo;t go to a rally unless it&rsquo;s about race - or more specifically, about their black race. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get on the bus to protest the &#8220;Jena 6&#8221;, attend &#8220;The Million Man March&#8221;, heck, they&rsquo;ll go campaign for &#8220;the black candidate&#8221;, but they do not make it a habit to concern themselves with any sort of rally or get-together if it isn&rsquo;t directly concerning the black race. </p>
