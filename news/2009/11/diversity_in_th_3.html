<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the first months of 1991, the United States military annihilated the Iraqi army. After several weeks of air raids and only three days of ground combat, American forces had little more to do but pack up and prepare for a victory parade. More than any other branch of the service, the Army had made the hard climb from its Vietnam abyss to the triumphant force of Desert Storm.</p>
<p>In the Vietnam era, the Army suffered from three major flaws: poorly trained non-commissioned officers, drugs, and racial tension. The victory in the Gulf suggested to the American public that these flaws were fixed and, indeed, two were. The post-Vietnam army started an intense training program for sergeants, and the schooling gets tougher as they move up the ladder. The military also invested heavily in drug screening, and entire units, including senior officers, were put through random drug tests. Specialists were hired to deal with addiction. The last problem, racial tension, however, has been only partly solved.</p>
<p>As 1960s-style integration is increasingly shown to be a myth, the military remains the last bastion of racial mixing, but a thin veneer masks serious trouble. Politicians and pundits brave the wrath of the thought police to keep women out of combat and young troopers away from practicing homosexuals, but no one talks about the problems of race. Despite Hollywood clich√©s like <cite>Glory,</cite> blacks have often been at best a mixed benefit and at worst a burden to the service. Racial conflict is out of the limelight, and the US Army is an effective fighting force, but trouble can erupt any time.</p>
<p>Non-whites in the armed forces cause three problems. The first is unit and soldier indiscipline. In the past, entire black regiments have behaved badly, and individual blacks often follow the same pattern. Second, blacks and whites sometimes think and behave differently. Bridging the gap is costly and never entirely successful, and racial divisions sap unit morale. Third, there is the added trouble of other non-white troops. An increasing number of racial and religious minorities can give rise to unique kinds of trouble.</p>
<p>The military was officially desegregated by President Truman in 1948, but segregated regiments weren&rsquo;t broken up in earnest until the first year of the Korean War. The catalyst for this was the poor combat record of black units. Most of the men with World War II experience had left, and the army conscripts were often from the bottom of society. Discipline was poor. Task Force Smith, the first ground combat units to face the North Koreans, was wiped out as an effective fighting force. The white regiments were bad but the black ones were worse. One cannot read about the Korean War without running into tales of black units that were unable to hold together under fire.</p>
<p>The all-black 24th Infantry was notorious for hasty retreats. This unit performed so badly that according to Max Hastings in <cite>The Korean War,</cite> General Walton H. Walker, commander of ground forces in Korea, &#8220;recognized that it was possible to use the 24th only as an outpost force, a trip wire in the face of Communist assaults. It proved necessary to maintain another regiment in reserve behind the front, to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;81.) Another all-black unit, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, performed disgracefully at the battle of Bloody Ridge in August 1951. In fact, &#8220;the 3/9 had done nothing. It had failed miserably in the only real attack it had attempted, and its C.O. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had been on the bottle.&#8221; (T.R. Fehrenbach, <cite>This Kind of War, </cite> p.&nbsp;359.)</p>
<p>After the disaster of Bloody Ridge, the Army desegregated its units so that blacks would make up roughly 10 percent of each company, and black soldiers were spread out one or two per squad. This meant no single regiment could be expected to do poorly in combat, but &#8220;the social problems, of course, were not solved.&#8221; (T.R. Fehrenbach, <cite>This Kind of War,</cite> p.&nbsp;359.)</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was the low point for military race relations, and by 1971 there was conflict wherever soldiers were stationed. Robert Heinl, Jr. described the crisis in an article called &#8220;Collapse of the Armed Forces&#8221; in the June 7, 1971 issue of <cite>Armed Forces Journal:</cite><blockquote>&#8220;Racial conflicts (most but not all sparked by young black enlisted men) are erupting murderously in all services. At a recent high commanders&rsquo; conference, General Westmoreland and other senior generals heard the report from Germany that in many units white soldiers are now afraid to enter barracks alone at night for fear of &#8216;head-hunting&rsquo; ambushes by blacks. In the quoted words of one soldier on duty in West Germany, &#8216;I&rsquo;m much more afraid of getting mugged on the post than I am of getting attacked by the Russians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other reports tell of jail-delivery attacks on Army stockades and military police to release black prisoners, and of officers being struck in public by black soldiers. Augsburg, Krailsheim, and Hohenfels are said to be rife with racial trouble. Hohenfels was the scene of a racial fragging last year  &mdash;  one of the few so far recorded outside Vietnam. In Ulm, last fall, a white noncommissioned officer killed a black soldier who was holding a loaded .45 on two unarmed white officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsewhere, according to <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine, junior officers are now being attacked at night when inspecting barracks containing numbers of black soldiers. Kelley Hill, a Ft. Benning, Ga., barracks area, has been the scene of repeated nighttime assaults on white soldiers. One such soldier bitterly remarked, &#8216;Kelley Hill may belong to the commander in the daytime but it belongs to the blacks after dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the cloistered quarters of WACs have been hit by racial hair-pulling. In one West Coast WAC detachment this year, black women on duty as charge-o-quarters took advantage of their trust to vandalize unlocked rooms occupied by white WACS. On this rampage, they destroyed clothing, emptied drawers, and overturned furniture of their white sisters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As early as July 1969 the Marines (who had previously enjoyed a highly praised record on race) made headlines at Camp Lejeune, N.C., when a mass affray launched by 30-50 black Marines ended fatally with a white corporal&rsquo;s skull smashed in and 145 other white Marines in the sick bay. That same year, at Newport, R.I., naval station, blacks killed a white petty officer, while in March 1971 the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., outside Washington, was beset by racial fighting so severe that the base enlisted men&rsquo;s club had to be closed.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Today, tensions are not nearly so bad. An all-volunteer army with standards that weed out the worst offenders is no longer the battleground it once was, but by the late 1990s black and Hispanic gangs were a serious problem. In Killeen, Texas, (outside Fort Hood) military gang members were a danger to civilians. The Army made a thorough effort to stamp out gangs, but the Department of Justice&rsquo;s National Gang Intelligence Center released a 2007 report covering nearly all the notorious non-white street gangs:<blockquote>&#8220;[They] have been documented on military installations both domestically and internationally. These members are present in most branches and across all ranks of the military, but are most common among the junior enlisted ranks. The US Army, Army Reserves, and National Guard are likely to have the most enlisted gang members because they are either the largest branches of the military, the service is part-time, or they tend not to be as selective as the other branches of the armed services.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>The report noted that white extremists in the military did kill a black couple in 1996, but after an extensive investigation, the authorities concluded that &#8220;there was no widespread or organized extremist activity in the Army,&#8221; and that &#8220;gang-related activities appear to be more pervasive than extremist activity on and near Army installations and are becoming a significant security concern for many soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably the greatest problem with blacks in the Army today is lack of ability, despite armed services qualification tests that wash out a considerably greater proportion of black applicants than white. Before my combat tour I found that blacks only slowly grasped the complex skills necessary for modern warfare. Once, as a passenger on a military bus, I overheard a group of blacks talking about something they all had in common: re-training. If a recruit fails a task, such as assembling a machine gun or operating a radio, he is culled from his squad for re-training. I never heard a knot of white soldiers discussing their common experience of re-training.</p>
<p>Blacks also fail the Army&rsquo;s quite challenging field artillery training course at an appalling rate. Statistics aren&rsquo;t public, but when I was learning the dark voodoo of artillery gunnery at Fort Sill&rsquo;s Officer Basic Course I was surprised that <em>all</em> of the blacks in my platoon who started with me flunked out or &#8220;recycled.&#8221; Likewise, all who graduated with me were &#8220;recycles&#8221; from earlier courses. These men were not raw 18-year-olds; to get in you had to be a college graduate and get through pre-commissioning training.</p>
<p>This lack of ability makes for problems. One black lieutenant who worked for me in the US needed special training to keep a monthly budget. Although he was a college graduate, he could not figure out how to pay his bills. He made enough money, but he couldn&rsquo;t manage his finances. Soon, creditors were calling the unit, and the situation was an embarrassment for the chain of command.</p>
<p>When I was stationed in Korea, a black major I worked for lead his troops from his barracks room. He would give a few directions by cell phone, and spend the rest of his time watching movies. This lack of face-to-face leadership led to disaster. In the office his outfit used, the ceiling tiles were rotting or missing, with exposed wires hanging down; the desks were covered with dust and garbage. This shabby ethos spread out to the men. The captains were demoralized, new lieutenants untrained. The sergeants worked uphill to maintain standards. Because there was no plan for combat training, the troops were available to be sucked into meaningless work details, such as grass trimming at the base post office.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Iraq, my night-shift counterpart was a black man with more than 20 years of experience. He had been diagnosed with serious sleep apnea and needed a special breathing machine to help him sleep. A man with this condition should not be in a war zone, but large black men are physically imposing, and often get their way. At his pre-deployment medical screening, he was naturally marked as not-deployable. He took exception to this and nearly came to blows with the doctor. The doctor cleared him.</p>
<p>During the night shift, he collected routine reports and did typical staff work. In the morning I based my work on what he had done, but I wasn&rsquo;t getting the information or cooperation I needed. I began getting criticism for my section&rsquo;s work, and soon every shift-change briefing became a heated argument.</p>
<p>One day this man took offense when I pointed out that every time an artillery shell is fired, it uses up a corresponding powder charge, and that we needed to order both replacement items together. His reply to this centuries-old observation was to insult me and remind me that I wasn&rsquo;t as &#8220;experienced&#8221; as he. Matters just got worse. Finally I cornered him on an easy thing he missed, and furiously asked him if he <em>actually</em> understood what he was doing. Unable to look me in the eye, he stormed out of the tent.</p>
<p>He got a medical evacuation from Iraq that very day because his breathing machine for sleep apnea suddenly &#8220;broke.&#8221; An enlisted man later told me he had innocently lent the officer a screwdriver that day. In any case, my section was never accused of sloppy work again.</p>
<p>That experience with the black officer was my racial awakening. He was the first of a host of blacks I saw in Iraq who suddenly discovered they had angina, breathing problems, or other hard-to-see &#8220;ailments.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not a doctor, so I don&rsquo;t know if their complaints were valid, but I always had a gut feeling they were a trick to go home early. Once they are in a war, few people want to stick around, and even fewer want to come back, but in general, the whites I knew left the service only after they had honorably finished their combat tours.</p>
<p>In Iraq, I was repeatedly stunned by the inability of many senior black officers to think through problems. In one case, I asked for increased close air support for an area commonly used by insurgents to fire mortars at American bases. A black officer refused air support, suggesting that we &#8220;put snipers in trees&#8221; to deal with the mortars. Iraq is a barren desert. The trees are mostly irrigated date palms and cannot support a sniper. That black officer worked hard and was certainly brave, but I am still amazed he came up with that foolishness about snipers. Bad staff work is a tremendous opportunity cost. It took me hours to get fighter-bomber coverage. This was valuable time wasted, and lives were needlessly endangered.</p>
<p>Likewise in Iraq, I had to cool tensions between a white Air National Guard lieutenant colonel and a black warrant officer. The white colonel was a Vietnam vet who had bitter memories of black behavior when he as a young draftee. The warrant officer was essentially worthless. I finally solved the problem simply by keeping the two men apart. I gave the black man no work, and he spent his waking hours playing video games.</p>
<p>Once I saw a black major so befuddled by the unit&rsquo;s vehicle bumper number standard that a five minute maintenance meeting turned into an afternoon marathon. What was the problem? Every combat vehicle in a unit gets a number. It is painted on the front and rear bumpers, and conforms to a standard that places the vehicle in its exact squad. For example, 1-300 IN K-6 would be the Kilo Company, First Battalion, 300th Infantry Commander&rsquo;s Vehicle. Different units have slightly different numbering standards, but they are not hard to figure out  &mdash;  except for this black major, who was stumped.</p>
<p>He was the operations officer, and his failure to grasp the obvious spread out to more important areas. Soon, battalion-level staff functions slowed to a crawl or just stopped. Routine procedures such as coordinating with Range Control when firing artillery became difficult operations. Eventually nothing worked right. When the head of a 500-man outfit does not have the brains to make common tasks routine or enough respect to make orders stick, things go wrong. The men become grouchy and troublesome. During several training exercises, 155mm artillery shells hit dangerously close to forward observers. Junior officers nicknamed the major &#8220;Abortion.&#8221; He was quietly replaced, but in a way that let him keep moving up.</p>
<p>Not all blacks and other non-whites were disruptive. Many were fantastic soldiers. But I did discover that nearly every major problem, accident, or scandal I saw in the service had a black or Hispanic at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Black officers are often unsatisfactory but at least they do not usually commit the kinds of crimes common among young black enlisted men. As a peacetime platoon leader, I was always being roped into rape investigations. Invariably the suspects were black. Whites would get drunk and rowdy, but I never knew one to be a rapist. Thanks to these investigations, I learned a new expression: &#8220;running a train.&#8221; This means gang rape, and comes from men standing in line waiting their turn. It is strictly black slang.</p>
<p>One black soldier in my platoon was a good soldier and a hard worker, but he had heavy baggage. He was picked up by the military police for drunk driving, and once he had to have all his combat gear reissued. He said it was stolen, but I suspect he pawned it. Still, he did his job well, and I worked hard to help him when he was indicted for rape in a civilian court. We even sent him home from a deployment a week ahead of his comrades so he could attend court hearings.</p>
<p>On the day of his trial, his platoon sergeant and section chief arrived in court, resplendent in their uniforms, to show support for their man. The judge informed the chain of command that the suspect had not met any of his preliminary court dates, and that he was going to be locked up. We never learned where he had gone when we sent him home, but he didn&rsquo;t go to court. His commander had to start writing up the paperwork to kick him out of the Army.</p>
<p>Sometimes black officers and leaders do fall into the error of their younger brothers. The Army covered up a serious gang rape scandal when a group of black officers in the 10th Mountain Division videotaped themselves ravishing some female soldiers. The officers were alumni of a black fraternity, and they brought their victims along as part of the entertainment for the fraternity&rsquo;s reunion party. This was on the heels of the Navy&rsquo;s Tail Hook scandal in 1991, so the bad press and the racial angle made for a quick high-brass silencing. The black officers were relieved of duty, but the cover up was so effective that I cannot find any trace of this incident on the Internet. I learned the facts from two different veterans of the unit who did not know each other, and who were an ocean apart when they told me their tales.</p>
<p>The 1997 sex/rape scandal at Aberdeen Proving Grounds was widely reported, however, and involved black drill sergeants shaking down female recruits for sex. The same year, the Sergeant Major of the Army, the highest-ranking enlisted man, was court marshaled when six women accused him of pressuring them for sex. Gene McKinney, the first black to serve in that position, was acquitted of sexual harassment but convicted of obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>The military has the same racial crime-rate discrepancies as civilian life. However, the Army has a job to do, and dealing with crime chews up resources. An enormous amount of effort went into the McKinney trial. Is there an important innovation that was not thought up as a result?</p>
<p>In a free society one would expect &#8220;whistleblowers,&#8221; but they are rare because of the equal opportunity bureaucracy. The consequences of failing an EO rating are worse than failing the annual marksmanship test. Every evaluation for leaders has a section on support for equal opportunity. A &#8220;No&#8221; ends a career.</p>
<p>Blacks know this, and some are tempted to make false charges of &#8220;racism.&#8221; One quartermaster captain told me he narrowly avoided a serious drubbing after a black first sergeant accused him of calling her and her troops &#8220;monkeys.&#8221; Her outfit ran a warehouse in Iraq, which he was responsible for inspecting. He said the warehouse was a &#8220;disaster,&#8221; and he thinks the &#8220;monkeys&#8221; accusation was meant to be a cover up. The accusation didn&rsquo;t go very far, but only because there was a black soldier with the captain who saw it all, and testified that the accusation was false. After that, the captain dealt with the warehouse supervisors through a black subordinate. As he explained to me, he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t need any more headaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Race causes other wastes. Colin Powell writes in his memoirs about a division commander who ordered every dogface to watch the movie <cite>Brian&rsquo;s Song.</cite> It is about an intense friendship between two football players  &mdash;  one white, the other black  &mdash;  and the commander thought the movie would ease racial tension. The division even sent MPs to round up idle men and bring them to theaters. What counter-insurgency book wasn&rsquo;t written because of <cite>Brian&rsquo;s Song</cite> duty?</p>
<p>There is a different problem with our increasingly &#8220;diverse&#8221; army. Many non-whites simply don&rsquo;t put forth much effort, and in extreme cases they can be more hostile to whites than to the enemy. A Korean West Point graduate pulled strings to leave his Iraq-bound unit for garrison duty near Seoul, where he became a multicultural &#8220;director of community outreach.&#8221; We were in a war, but he used up taxpayer dollars to take an unnecessary diversity job in Korea.</p>
<p>There are far worse problems than sloughing off. A serious fragging nearly decapitated a brigade of the 101st Airborne at the start of the Iraq War. An American-born black convert to Islam, Hasan Karim Akbar, killed two officers and wounded the brigade commander. In another fragging incident, Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, posted to Tikrit, Iraq, allegedly rolled a hand grenade into a room and killed two officers. His trial is hung up in legal motions.</p>
<p>Non-whites have caused other trouble. There have been serious fears of spying among the Muslim troops at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. All charges were later dropped against West Point graduate and Muslim chaplain, Captain James Yee, but he raised enough suspicion to be arrested. Several Arabs were arrested along with Captain Yee. They weren&rsquo;t convicted of spying but received convictions for lesser, but serious infractions.</p>
<p>Espionage cases are hard to prove. Accomplices can vanish back to their native lands, witnesses can be assassinated, and fingerprints, DNA, and other physical evidence can be more easily explained. Sometimes counterintelligence discovers evidence inadmissible in court. Often spies can be convicted only if they are caught in a sting where the evidence is overwhelming and can be used in court.</p>
<p>America now fights its wars in the Third World, and our policy of putting Third World people in the military is dangerous. It is only a matter of time before a Somali, Kurdish, Laotian, or Hmong &#8220;refugee&#8221; has the authority to call in air-strikes or command riflemen. Like the Romans who were destroyed by their Germanic mercenaries, Americans could find that their army is a foreign viper.</p>
<p>Diversity has been turned against us in the past. During the Philippine Insurrection early in the 20th century, the troublesome, all-black 24th Infantry produced a renegade named David Fagen. He deserted from the American side and accepted a Philippine Army commission as a captain. The Filipino insurgents had offered such a deal to any black deserter. Captain Fagen was not the only black turncoat, but their numbers were small, since Filipinos and blacks are a world apart. If the fighting had been in Africa things might have been different. Still, the Fagen incident caused a decline in trust between the races, and even a certain hysteria. After American setbacks, one journalist concluded that Filipino successes were the result of, &#8220;the scheming of American deserters, who were so familiar with army routines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Successful military operations must be glued together with trust, and diversity destroys trust. In diverse groups, the tendency is to hunker down, avoid making friends, and just try to survive. Instead of quickly starting from a common point, American soldiers must spend time developing trust. Some black senior officers cannot quite believe that white subordinates aren&rsquo;t ready to blast them; the ghosts of Reconstruction and Jim Crow rise easily at a forward operating base filled with muscular, blue-eyed white men with assault rifles.</p>
<p>Likewise, white soldiers may not trust black officers, since they are often baffled by simple problems and quick to be swept up in vice. Too often, black leaders and enlisted men can appear to be nothing more than the gangster types who were despised back in a white&rsquo;s home town.</p>
<p>Instead of working through problems, developing innovative tactics, or focusing on training, soldiers must spend time smoothing wrinkles and dealing with tensions that otherwise would not exist. The alienation, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug-taking, and other pathologies commonly found in veterans since Vietnam are probably related, at least in part, to this lack of trust.</p>
<p>The unwillingness to recognize desegregation&rsquo;s failures may even influence strategy at the highest level. In its August 8, 2003 issue, the British newspaper, the <cite>Telegraph,</cite> quoted from a speech by Condoleezza Rice:<blockquote>&#8220;&#8216;Like many of you, I grew up around the home-grown terrorism of the 1960s. I remember the bombing of the church in Birmingham in 1963, because one of the little girls that died was a friend of mine,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Americans should stand by others seeking freedom today, she went on, and shun the &#8216;condescending&rsquo; argument that some races or nations were not interested in or ready for Western freedoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&rsquo;ve heard that argument before. And we, more than any, as a people, should be ready to reject it,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;That view was wrong in 1963 in Birmingham and it is wrong in 2003 in Baghdad and in the rest of the Middle East.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>In fact, Iraq has no history of democracy nor any real prospects for it, and more than 50 years after Birmingham, American jails are filled with blacks. Delusions always come back to haunt the deluded.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s position at the top is lonely and precarious. Any military slipup can embolden our enemies. Pol Pot was certainly aided by America&rsquo;s withdrawal from Vietnam, and Osama bin Laden was inspired to strike after our failure in Somalia. Any lack of trust within our fighting formations, any lost opportunity, any crime, any bad judgment makes the worst more likely.</p>
<p>But the most important danger is domestic. It is simply a matter of time before whites vote clearly for their own interests. At that point, an alien army could spark a serious domestic and Constitutional crisis. To avoid such a calamity, Uncle Sam needs an army loyal to Americans and sympathetic to their institutions.</p>

		<p>I was in a combat arms battalion in the 10th Mountain Division in 1992 when the black officers were &#8220;disciplined&#8221; for the sexual assault mentioned in this article.  My platoon leader, a 1LT who had attended Georgetown, was one of the officers shuffled off to administrative duty while he was waiting for his discharge.  It was all very hush-hush, and we never found out exactly what happened to him or the other black officers. </p>
<p>Several of the white enlisted women who were gang raped, as well as a black Captain who was involved in the rape, were members of the MI unit next door to my unit.  Other members of the MI unit relayed the story to us while the investigation was going on. </p>

		<p>Well, I guess it&rsquo;s true that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
<p>My war was Vietnam, where I did two yours, one in a rifle company and another with the 5th Special Forces.  While most black troopers performed at least adequately, and in some cases admirably, almost all disciplinary problems had blacks as their source, and the inmates of the so-called Long Binh Jail were mostly black, though they made up only about 12% of the<br>
Army&rsquo;s strength in that conflict.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s changed enormously since that era is that while blacks were about evenly represented throughout all Military Occupational Specialties back then, today the combat arms are overwhelmingly white and Hispanic.  Blacks are now found mainly in the support functions, since recruits can today be pretty much guaranteed of their preferred MOS.  Paradoxically, things have reverted to what they were before the Korean war, prior to which blacks were pretty much restricted to logistical functions.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in my war it was my experience that Hispanics made damn good troopers, with pride in their manhood and eagerness to prove themselves, whether volunteers or draftees. I don&rsquo;t remember ever having any problems whatever with them. </p>
<p>It should surprise no one that blacks in the military will display pretty much the same characteristics they do anywhere else, even given the military&rsquo;s selection process.  Any NCO, any officer, any unit commander can expect that the majority of his headaches and serious problems will originate with blacks, or at the least that they will be grossly overrepresented in their involvement with whatever problems exist.</p>

		<p>The observation that black officers are often baffled by simple problems is one I&rsquo;ve harped on constantly on this forum.  It&rsquo;s not only true of black officers, but non-commissioned ones as well.</p>
<p>Carter started the ball rolling on this push to get unqualified blacks in leadership positions, but it was Clinton&rsquo;s appointment of Togo West that intensified the problem.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard anything so far, but, of course, it will be Far, far worse under Obama.  Just look at his choice for a leader in Casey.  The pitiful general stupidly asserted that it was better to lose troops than to lose any kind of diversity in the military.  And the West Point director (Or Annapolis, I don&rsquo;t remember which)  declared his unrelenting love for diversity and would make it his highest priority.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said MANY times before, one of our next greatest calamities will involve the military and its policy of diversity.</p>
<p>But, then, what makes the difference?  This empire is falling apart, and I&rsquo;d be VERY surprised if we did not split apart in large scale fighting by 2015, so it looks like the end is near.  Civil conflict is the only way we will escape a military disaster involving a determined enemy.</p>

		<p>A very timely article. More so now than ever.  This article also explains why this country has never won a clear-cut conflict (maybe Gulf War I, in 1991 the exception) since World War II.</p>
<p>General George Patton recognized the incompetence of black troops in the Second World War, and that&rsquo;s good enough for me. Blacks may be all big and tough in urban street gangs like the Crips, Bloods, Black Panthers, etc., but in actual combat they turn into mugabedug.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the military for 7 1/2 years, and I can sadly report that this story is only the tip of the iceburg. White soldiers, whether they are junior enlisted, NCO&rsquo;s, or officers, HATE working with minorities, especially blacks. Blacks, especially lower enlisted, are lazy and confrontational. I, as a senior NCO, had a physical confrontation with a black female enlisted soldier after she cut in line at a training event. Guess who was reprimanded by the CO? Me, because in the CO&rsquo;s words, &#8220;its more important that everyone gets along than it is to enforce standards.&#8221; Those words have always stuck with me, and probably will until I die.</p>
<p>I hate to sound grim, but the military, at least the Army, has become a joke. Non-whites do as they please, whites do all the work, and &#8220;diversity is our greatest strength&#8221; is the unofficial motto. It&rsquo;s not getting better, its getting worse. White NCO&rsquo;s and officers are afraid to reprimand blacks. Blacks expect whites to kowtow before them. Female soldiers cry when they have to do the same work and combat duties as men, then cry when they feel like they are not treated as equals. </p>
<p>Believe me, the military situation is worse then civilians can imagine.</p>

<p>Black gang violence and inter-country armed warfare aren&rsquo;t the same thing.  The former&rsquo;s purpose is the establishment and protection of street level drug distribution territory.  Crip smoking blood that happened to sling crack on the wrong street is hardly the same thing as an infantry division killing enemy soldiers to take a hill.  </p>
<p>This is why when dingbat black women with &#8220;non profit&#8221; groups in urban areas call for a &#8220;truce&#8221; in the &#8220;gang wars,&#8221; that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re blowing smoke.

		<p> When it comes to charges of rape of female soldiers in the Army I would like to add my experiences to the conversation. I was an enlisted man in MI Batts from 1987-93. While I share the same feelings about blacks that my fellow AmRenners have, I still try to be fair no matter what.</p>
<p>I spent 6 yrs. in Army barracks. combat support units i.e., Med,Signal,Trans,Chem,Ava,and MI are often co-ed. When the week-end hits at 16:30 everyone started drinking booze from the class 6 store, females too. The drinking didn&rsquo;t stop until Sunday night, when everybody started catching up on laundry and uniform maintenance for the upcoming week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m am not a misogynist, but my experience was that the lions share of single female soldiers in the barracks had the same sexual appetites the men had, in terms of amount of sex had, and the variety of partners. Myself and my buddies passed around quite a few of the barracks girls, and while I never &#8221; pulled a train&#8221; I knew of a few that happened. Female soldiers in Germany were especially sexually available because that had to compete with German girls for our attentions. </p>
<p>The point I am trying to make is that rape accusations need to be taken with a grain of salt and thoroughly investigated with a critical eye in regards to all particulars. I suspect some of these rape charges were brought by women who drank too much and were embarrassed by the &#8220;morning after&#8221; fallout, i.e. pictures,video, verbal accounts of multiple partner activity sometimes with black men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to be fair, bros before&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. </p>

<p>Of coure I recognize the difference between inner-city gang warfare between Bantu factions, and warfare between countries. The latter is more organized, with objectives, strategies and tactics. Inner-city gang &#8220;wars&#8221; are much more haphazard.

		<p>When I was in the Army (1973-75, 7th Combat Support Hospital, Germany), we had no Muslims (thank God), but a mix of whites, some Puerto Ricans, and blacks.  It was probably 50% white, overall, at least in the lower enlisted ranks, with white officers.  Whites were assigned medical roles (O.R. techs, xray techs and so forth) with blacks performing motor pool and mess hall duty  &mdash;  at least as I recall.</p>
<p>Barracks were self-segregated, and off duty interracial interaction was minimal.  Lower enlisted blacks were often heroin users; the white drug of choice being Asian sourced hash.  As long as blacks doped they were typically more or less passive.  When the heroin dried up (as it did, occasionally) you could tell because blacks would then become more antagonistic, and sometimes assaultive-both to each other and whites.  Interracial dating was not common; for whatever reason blacks had German girls to keep them satisfied.  I remember one white privatess who began dating a married black NCO, but she was immediately shunned by the white soldiers.  In those days I do not recall any Army propaganda about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; one way or the other. It would have made no difference, since everyone knew the truth.</p>

		<p>At Camp Pendleton in the late 1960&rsquo; our NCOs (white) warned us white Marines to travel in groups to avoid being accosted by blacks.  On post violence between whites and blacks was relatively common.  A white Marine traveling alone (on base) stood a good chance of being beaten by roving gangs of black Marines.  Note that the confrontations were NEVER one-on-one.  Blacks would travel in &#8220;packs&#8221; as predators against lone whites.<br>
Robbery was the primary motive although &#8220;racial tension&#8221; quite often was the &#8220;official excuse&#8221;.</p>

		<p>James Webb in his book &#8220;Born Fighting&#8221; states that most of the white recruits in the US army are of Scots-Irish origin.</p>
<p>Thus, the American army&rsquo;s strength, and weakness, relies on the Scots-Irish Americans.</p>
<p>Two of the worrisome traits of the Scots-Irish is their <br>
&#8220;I am poor but proud&#8221; attitude and their disinterest in education, because Islam thrives on &#8220;poor but proud&#8221;, and uneducated people.</p>
<p>The American elite have now one group of poor but proud people<br>
(Scots-Irish) fighting other groups of poor but proud peoples (Iraqis/Afghans), all the while insulting the Scots-Irish by calling them &#8220;rednecks&#8221;, looking down on them in the Academia, and making fun of them in Hollywood movies. </p>
<p>( According to Webb, &#8220;redneck&#8221; and &#8220;cracker&#8221; were originally  ethnic slurs used by the English to refer to the Scots/Scots-Irish. )</p>
<p>If Islamists, with backing from rich Arab countries, were to focus their attention on the Scots-Irish and tell them that Islam is anti-Hollywood, anti-Academia, anti-Establshment, anti-AngloSaxon, anti-feminist, pro-gun, pro-man, pro-tradition, pro-poor, pro-Celt, than they might make a sizeable number of converts.</p>
<p>Webb describes the Scots-Irish as</p>
<p>&#8220;A quick-tempered but sensual and playful people, they often dressed provocatively, acted with a volatile belligerence, drank to excess, engaged in constant and open competition in every form, and adamantly defied the attempts of outsiders to control them. Scots-Irish culture is a study in wild contrasts. They are intensely religious but at the same time unapologetically and even devilishly hedonistic. Antiauthoritarian as well as patriotic. Rebellious but make fine soldiers. They are filled with wanderlust and are ethnically assimilative, but their love of their own heritage can move them to tears. &#8220;</p>
<p>So, hopefully, the qualities listed above will keep them from turning Muslim.<br>

		<p>This piece is a honest authentic account and I can say that as an honorably discharged veteran I find his observations 100% accurate. </p>
<p>Some things this officer didn&rsquo;t delve into include the high level of drug abuse in the military by non-whites. I can remember black enlisted personnel being caught actually shooting heroin in the berthing compartments aboard Navy vessels in the late 70&rsquo;s-early 80&rsquo;s. Stealing is another one. Non-whites will take it if they think they can get away with it. </p>

		<p> I was  stationed at Ford Hood twice during the 70&rsquo;s. Gangs of blacks roamed the post, the buses, and even the streets of Killeen, attacking whites whenever they found them alone or greatly outnumbered. There were several instances of whites being shot in their bunks at night by blacks as other whites cowered under their covers and refused to testify, let alone intervene. The MP&rsquo;s were finding white bodies in dumpsters all over post, victims of the black dogpacks. The service clubs might as well have been harlem nightclubs, such was the danger to single whites going to one for an evening&rsquo;s entertainment. One night I watched helplessly from the window of my barracks as four blacks chased down a white and beat him unconscious. I tried to get a couple of my white brothers in arms to go down and intervene, but not a single one would. <br>
 I and some other whites, took to carrying firearms off duty, both on and off post. Needless to say, it was a court-martial offense but the odds were much better of being assaulted by a blackpack than of getting caught with the well concealed firearm.  I had need of mine several times.<br>
 Then, as now, the Army responded to the black crime spree by sticking their heads in the sand. The officers and NCO&rsquo;s were afraid of the blacks, and afraid of their own command&rsquo;s response to complaints about black rampant crime. Things haven&rsquo;t changed much in 30 years.</p>

		<p>It sounds to me that the Armed Forces, like civilian society, has come to the point where if a black attacks a white and the white either: 1) defends himself too vigorously; or 2) is defended by white bystanders or friends; the white people will be prosecuted as seriously or charged with even more serious charges than the black perps.  This is a genuine fear.  A white charged with a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime goes to prison and subject to Supreme Court approved rape.  If they survive that their lives are ruined.  Look at the poor woman who pulled on the muslims scarf - she may well do more time than the Hawaiian who ran over the white family in a parking lot a while back.  Civil Rights laws and Hate Crime laws are intended to keep whites in their place until the take over is complete.  And keep in mind, whites on a jury, unlike blacks, will not hold out for an innocent verdict and cause a mistrial like black jurors will.  They just want to go home and to hell with their kinsmen.  Stalin, Mao and Castro could not have thought of a better population control through terror system.<br>

		<p>It is not racial diversity that is major problem today, but multicultural diversity and political correctness that is destroying the military. Generally speaking most of the Blacks go into the service and support units to learn a trade. The combat units are made up of mostly White kids that want to play Rambo for a few years, get out and use their GI benefits to go to College. </p>
<p>Gang bangers, boys of the hood and other such individuals couldn&rsquo;t join the military, even if they wanted to. Their drug use and criminal records would keep them out.</p>
<p>The problem is our growing dependence of &#8220;foreign&#8221; troops in the military that do not embrace our values. Even though Major Nidal Hasan was born here in the United States. His values and ideas were just as alien to our way of life as if he was born and raised in an Islamic country. As many of you have pointed out, Blacks may be less than qualified, but they don&rsquo;t pose the physical danger that these foreign born troops do.</p>
<p>Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that they are quite capable of waging modern warfare against us. Now we are filling our ranks with them. We are training then in modern military tactics which they may one day use against us. </p>

		<p>Young Turk used James Webb for his stats, but Mr. Webb was off a bit. Probably due to having an agenda. For the last 100 years, most of the whites in the military have been of German-American extraction. The Scots-Irish are the group who receive medals for bravery at far higher rates than other ethnic and racial groups, including the exaggerated numbers for hispanics and asians (aided by Clinton handing out Medals of Honor to asians, blacks and hispanics like candy, much like LBJ). The Scots-Irish and other Whites generally do not have the chip on their shoulder that non-whites and certain privileged ethnic groups possess, whether innate or from constant brainwashing by schools and TV while growing up. There is little worry of the Scots-Irish or other whites being co-opted by Muslims or anyone else and turning against the US or against Whites. There is worry of non-whites, meaning blacks, hispanics, and asians turning against whites, as with the blacks and others mentioned above; &#8220;Captain&#8221; James Yee, the Korean running away from Iraq by creating a diversity office, and &#8220;Sgt&#8221; Alberto Martinez fragging a couple of officers. These people have no true loyalty to this country or its founding population. When the big collapse hits, the armed forces will eventually fracture along racial lines. Good. </p>

<p>***************************************************<br>
No, they are not!    The fact is, when you know their TOTAL compensation, after a few years on the job  (despite their union propaganda always crying poverty) that they are VERY WELL  paid.  Nor is &#8220;police officer&#8221; a job classified by actuarial organizations as a dangerous occupation.  (Surprise, surprise!)   Most of it is just routine and paper work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant some allowance for the cops on patol, the ones you actually see out on the street  doing real police work. The ones the public thinks of as &#8220;cops&#8221;.   But what percentage of the force  are they?  After a few years, many tend to drift into slots  indoors where they can hide out for the remainder of their 20 years until it&rsquo;s time to collect that pension while they&rsquo;re still in their early forties, and then go on to another career.  If at all possible, they&rsquo;ll manage to get out even sooner on an obscure medical disability. </p>
<p>You should try to find out what percentage of your force is actually on patrol.  Good luck!  But you can&rsquo;t because    &mdash;   no matter what the official figures  say   &mdash;   departments don&rsquo;t even know the true number.   Commanding officers lie and fudge and send in false figures,  and one hand washes the other, so headquarters or the mayor&rsquo;s office can&rsquo;t even give you an accurate number. They don&rsquo;t know!  Of course, they won&rsquo;t admit it.  What I say would apply in very BIG city departments, obviously. A smaller town or city, having fewer officers, would be able to keep better track of them.  But huge cities are out of control.   Their Police Departments aren&rsquo;t run for the public; they&rsquo;re run by the police, for the police.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve said applies ESPECIALLY  to the legions of affirmative action females (mostly non-white nowadays)  who are hidden inside &#8220;working&#8221;  as EEO counselors, &#8220;youth&#8221; officers, &#8220;community affairs&#8221; liasons,  or  doing filing work for maybe  a couple of hours and spending the rest of the day on the phone, watching TV, and doing their nails.  Don&rsquo;t try to tell me otherwise!</p>

		<p>I disagree with Southern Hoosier&rsquo;s assertion regarding racial demographics in the U.S. military. Yes whites are one of the most pro¬≠portionally represented groups making up 77.4 percent of the population but this includes latinos. &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; is considered an ethnic, not a racial, category that is registered separately. As a result the 77.4 percent number includes all latinos. </p>
<p>The largest group of non-citizen soldiers are Latinos. Almost all of the foreign soldiers in our military are non-Whites.</p>

		<p>Poster 21, you better check your facts again. Yes, the military is recruiting gang members and illegals. I disagree totally with you that it is not racial diversity that is NOT a problem. Yes, it is! Where have you been. Race is the number one problem in this country and it is growing worse by the minute. And please don&rsquo;t tell me that blacks cause no problems in our military! I guess you didn&rsquo;t read the other article on here about the problems many had with blacks in the military??? </p>

		<p>21#&hellip;Yes, and as we have been compared to ancient Rome in other ways, also military wise. We have to be prepared if there is a collapse and grateful to sites like this for open communications.</p>

		<p> &#8220;The only reasons why they are successful at pushing people out of our cities is A)the element of surprise, when preying upon ordinary people; and B)our soft-hearted hand-wringing approach in dealing with them.&#8221;<br>

______</p>
<p>To that I would add:  <br>
C.   Our lack of any organized, effective resistance&hellip;  all because certain  powerful groups have outlawed it and demonized it, turning the instruments of (our) government against us,  thus leaving us defenseless. </p>
<p>And so, for the past half-century, we&rsquo;ve been left with no alternative but &#8220;white flight&#8221;.  Now, they&rsquo;re looking for ways to undo that!</p>

		<p>Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that they are quite capable of waging modern warfare against us. Now we are filling our ranks with them.</p>
<p>WRONG!! the muslims can fight us because our hands are tied, the rules of engagement are such that a kid can go to prison for life if he kills a muslim. With 3 1/2 years in Viet-Nam when we filed after action reports and stated the killing of say,,,,,10 enemy, the upward movement of that report would double or more the number killed, but NOW!! we try to deny most of the killings when we should be using scorched earth tactics against the muslims. The media over here, and our own congress, is a greater threat to us than the enemy.</p>

&#8220;James Webb in his book &ldquo;Born Fighting&rdquo; states that most of the white recruits in the US army are of Scots-Irish origin.</p>
<p>The American elite have now one group of poor but proud people<br>
(Scots-Irish) fighting other groups of poor but proud peoples (Iraqis/Afghans), all the while insulting the Scots-Irish by calling them &ldquo;rednecks&rdquo;, looking down on them in the Academia, and making fun of them in Hollywood movies.&#8221; </p>
<p>&gt; Interesting to note that most volunteers that end up seeing combat are typically from regions that have traditionally been Scots-Irish settled regions or regions where they spread out and were later joined by other groups like Germanics and other Northern European groups.  This is because these regions still tend to be rural and it is also no coincidence that the whites from these regions still buy into the old, ferverent patriotism where they recognize themselves, their religion, and their culture as the real America, and somehow still dominant.  Meanwhile, the nation has been fading away.  It is no coincidence that the largest number of casualities in the current wars are typically from white, rural, Christian Conservative regions of the country where Scots-Irish were the original colonial cultural influence.  You have to include all those Welsh miners that came over too because they were Celts as well.</p>
<p>&#8221;( According to Webb, &ldquo;redneck&rdquo; and &ldquo;cracker&rdquo; were originally ethnic slurs used by the English to refer to the Scots/Scots-Irish. )  &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; &#8220;Crack&#8221; was and is still a term used in Ireland to describe good, entertaining, conversation.  </p>
<p>&gt; The documentary I saw on The Appalachians, where Scots-Irish largely settled early during our colonial history cites the red bandanas that union supporters wore around their necks to identify themselves during actual battles early in the 20th century with the coal corporation&rsquo;s hired thugs the origin of the term &#8220;Redneck.&#8221;  Some may recall that the U.S. Army was eventuallyy called in to put them down.  The &#8220;Rednecks&#8221; declined to fight against the Army because many of them had just finished serving in France in WW2.  Thus, the Coal Bosses won.  I personally knew one widow of a coal miner from those days and she hated Republicans with a fierce fervor until the day  she died at 94.</p>

		<p>I was in the Navy during the Vietnam War and there were racial problems from the first day in boot camp. And it was always the blacks who initiated the confrontations whether it be verbal or physical. These racial problems continued on board ship and even the captain was afraid to discipline blacks because he feared rioting and cries of racism. Diversity in the military has never worked. I also knew a girl back in the 70&rsquo;s who had a female friend who was gang raped on Okinowa by black marines.</p>

		<p>Poster #3 stated Clinton&rsquo;s appointment of Togo West as Sec of Army intensified the problem but this is incorrect,  Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s Sec of Army, Clifford Alexander(a black) really sunk his teeth into the race issue and thought there were too many &#8220;brothers&#8221; in the combat arms so Alexander declared the ASVAB (classification tests) to be &#8220;malnormed&#8221; and opened up jobs in finance, personnel, and the medical field(other than stretcher carriers) for blacks with low apptitude scores(due, he said, to the malnormed ASVAB tests).  Within a short time your best and brightest were in the combat arms while blacks were screwing up the pay, not posting promotions nor notifying soldiers they were on orders for overseas, and unable to take your vital signs if you were ill.  This still continues in many cases today.  Space does not allow me to address the race riots in Vietnam other than to say I survived one &#8220;fragging&#8221; in 1970.  Race riots in Korea during this period and throughout the Army were terrible also.  It was really a &#8220;hollow&#8221; Army.  </p>

		<p>By tolerating militant Muslims like Hassan, gang-members and illegal aliens in the armed forces, while engaging in a multi-year witch-hunt for &#8220;skinheads&#8221;, the Pentagon is telling well-behaved, conscientious, dutiful whites that they are not wanted in the military.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.  Please go find someone else now to fill your body-bags.</p>
