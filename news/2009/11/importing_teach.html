<h1>Importing Teachers in the District of Columbia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Hollingsworth, Washington Examiner, November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>District of Columbia Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee is in hot water for firing 266 teachers and administrators Oct. 2, just weeks into the new school year and only a few months after inexplicably hiring hundreds of new teachers. {snip}</p>
<p>According to the federal government&rsquo;s Foreign Labor Certification Data Center, D.C. Public Schools submitted 46 labor condition applications in 2007 and 2008, giving Rhee authority to import hundreds of foreign teachers on H1B visas without having to make any attempt to find eligible Americans.</p>
<p>With the jobless rate now topping 10 percent, tens of thousands of American engineers, scientists and other professionals would be more than happy to try a second career teaching. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s no coincidence that young immigrants are willing to work for far less than their American counterparts; the wage scale for hundreds of novice teachers in D.C., average age 32, is near the bottom of the District&rsquo;s unionized pay schedule. But when USA Today reports that there are not enough jobs for all the students graduating from U.S. colleges and universities, why are employers  &mdash;  including school districts  &mdash;  still allowed to import foreigners?</p>
<p>An eerily similar scenario unfolded at the Recovery School District in Baton Rouge, La., after Hurricane Katrina. Just two years after RSD Superintendent Paul Vallas (formerly head of Chicago&rsquo;s public schools) complained about a serious shortage of teachers, he announced major job cuts  &mdash;  and mainly older Americans were let go.</p>
<p>Guess how they were replaced. Lourdes Navarro, who ran a teacher &#8220;bodyshop,&#8221; is accused of illegally withholding up to 20 percent of the pay of the young, inexperienced Filipino teachers she brought into the United States to staff RSD&rsquo;s low-performing schools.</p>
<p>Rob Sanchez, author of the Job Destruction Newsletter, says that teachers union officials have been reluctant &#8220;to challenge the liberal consensus that immigration is a good thing. As long as the imported teachers join the union, they are willing to sacrifice their American members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since visa holders can easily be coerced into joining the union and forced to do whatever the union bosses demand, union officials didn&rsquo;t bother to protect the 20,000 or so American educators who lost their teaching jobs to foreign competitors  &mdash;  many of whom they were forced to train.</p>

		<p>2 Peejay: the foreign teachers know what a privilege to go to school, and are absolutely appalled at the behavior they see.  Most of them quit and get non-teaching jobs, displacing other Americans.  They will Not be deported, any more than an illiterate Mexican would.  </p>

		<p>We just had a Mexican female teacher arrested here for having sex with one of her students. She taught English as a second language&hellip;of course some of the students (Mexicans) saw nothing wrong with what she did. They all think it is normal and wonder why she was even arrested. Yeah, let&rsquo;s get more Mexican teachers.</p>

		<p>Far be it from me to defend this official, but could it be she&rsquo;s importing teachers from the 3rd World because there aren&rsquo;t enough literate blacks in D.C. to qualify as teachers? </p>

		<p>I spent 3 miserable years in a DC high school. The fact that I made it out in piece still surprises me. I&rsquo;d sooner go to Afghanistan than go back to NE DC.</p>

		<p>Unions are totally corrupt. All of them. They have long ago given up on looking out for the best interests of working class Americans. American union workers are themselves to blame for much of it. You can&rsquo;t sit around being ignorant of what the union is doing. I belonged to one for a long time, and union meetings were never attended but by a small minority of the membership. It&rsquo;s just like everything else in life, you have to work at things to make them work for you, marriage, growing crops, making your representatives look out for you,etc. If we sit back and act as if all of these things we are connected to in modern society are simply going to take care of us, then we have no more control than someone who is connected to dozens of machines in a hosptial bed.</p>

<p>Exactly. The culture shock has to immense. And those &#8220;kids&#8221; will take advantage and do all they can to intimidate and cause trouble. A few days or weeks at the most and at least 90 % of them will be gone. Would not be the case if they taught in a place like Du Page county IL., for instance.</p>
<p>I am still surprised that Rhee is continuing as head of the schoo&rsquo; district in DC. I had thought she would not last too long either. But is not having quite the degree of succes everyone had hoped for. HOPE it was and always will be.</p>
