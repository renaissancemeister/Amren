<h1>I&rsquo;m Not Your &#8216;Bud.&rsquo; You Can Call Me Mr. Fountain.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John W. Fountain, Chicago Sun-Times, October 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is &#8220;bud&#8221; the new &#8220;boy&#8221;? As a black man  &mdash;  even in a &#8220;post-racial America,&#8221; where a black man now occupies the White House  &mdash;  I still wonder.</p>
<p>Usually the way it happens is I&rsquo;m somewhere out here in the Windy City, or near my home in the south suburbs, minding my own business, going about the daily fare, when suddenly I hear the annoying call  &mdash;  &#8220;Bud&#8221;  &mdash;  or some similar moniker, dangling from the end of some salutation: &#8220;Thanks, bud.&#8221; &#8220;How can I help you, bud?&#8221; &#8220;What&rsquo;s up, bud?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes I am running errands near home  &mdash;  buying tires, searching at a home improvement store for a toilet flapper valve; or near my office on Michigan Avenue, purchasing a new mailbox; or on a Loop elevator, or in a downtown lobby. And whether it is bud, buddy, boss, pal, pimp, or playa, all of it offends. For I am none of these.</p>
<p>The offenders most often are white, sometimes younger than me and almost always in service or blue-collar positions. Most often it is the &#8220;b&#8221; word that is used. It feels too informal a title for perfect strangers, especially when I suspect they call other full-grown men sir.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be called bud might ordinarily seem innocuous enough. I have called my own sons buddy. My nephews bud, and even the dog I once had, bud.</p>
<p>But I am neither boy nor dog. And the name offends, especially coming from the lips of those who, in my mind, defer to the &#8220;b&#8221; word rather than call me by my name, or as a man, now a year shy of 50, by mister, or sir.</p>
<p>Bud is a condescending rub in a day when some would contend that racism has long since been buried, like that sliver of time in American history when every black man  &mdash;  no matter his status, stature or the silver in his beard  &mdash;  was a boy.</p>
<p>Still, I wonder whether I am being hypersensitive or simply stuck in the past, my consciousness inalterably warped by past racial offenses endured by black men once upon a time in America. And I ask myself if I have become one of those so-called arrogant black men, too uppity for my britches, to dare feel out of sorts for being referred to by something as harmless as bud? What&rsquo;s the big deal, buddy?</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I cannot shake from my mind the stories I have heard from black men like my grandfather of the way we used to have to cross the street in the South to let whites pass; how black men could not look whites in the eye, or how, sometimes to survive we had to kowtow, yessuh or shuck-yuck.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I want to shout back: &#8220;They call me Mr. Fountain. Or Professor. Or John, or Sir.&#8221; That &#8220;I am neither your buddy, nor your bud.&#8221; That &#8220;I am not your son, not your boy, nor your damn dog, and I certainly ain&rsquo;t your buddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most often I figure it just isn&rsquo;t worth my trouble.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear it now: &#8220;Get over it, bud. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I intend to, though this elusive quest for respect as a black man, in a world that sometimes still seems intent on diminishing us, on reducing us to being less than men, stirs my anger.</p>

		<p>I have to admit &#8220;Bud&#8221; and &#8220;boss&#8221; are annoying to hear, however it is annoying for everybody not just black&rsquo;s. The author should take a look at how younger black&rsquo;s treat older white customers to be fair.</p>

<p>We all have the right to be offended.  They exercise that freedom more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best just not to give a damn about their feelings as they will never be content.</p>
<p>Stay away from them, speak away from them, and plain out steer clear.</p>

In the classic scene from Monty Pythons Holy Grail, King Arther approaches someone from behind (Dennis) and begins this conversation:</p>
<p><b>Arthur: Old woman!</b></p>
<p>Dennis: MAN!</p>
<p>Arthur: Old man, sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?</p>
<p>Dennis: I&rsquo;m 37.</p>
<p>Arthur: What?</p>
<p>Dennis: I&rsquo;m 37, I&rsquo;m not old!</p>
<p>Arthur: Well, I can&rsquo;t just call you &#8220;man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dennis: You could say &#8220;Dennis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arthur: I didn&rsquo;t know you were called Dennis.</p>
<p><br>
We have to refer to people in some manner.</p>
<p>This is just a black man looking to start another controversy to keep the white man on his toes.  </p>
<p>Considering the other words people could use, you&rsquo;d think this was meaningless.</p>
<p>Is homie still acceptable?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want angry black men for my &#8220;buds,&#8221; especially since once this &#8220;angry black man&#8221; manages to stigmatize the friendly word &#8220;bud,&#8221; he and his ilk will find some new word to feel angry and offended over (e.g., I can hear him exclaiming sometime in the near future, &#8220;&#8216;Pal&rsquo;?  Who you callin&rsquo; &#8216;pal&rsquo;?? That&rsquo;s demeaning&hellip;RACIST&hellip;&#8221;)  Better for white people to avoid dealing with such at all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bud&#8221; may be construed as lacking in general respect, but racist?!  I can understand that Fountain would rather be addressed as &#8220;sir&#8221; because I, as a senior woman, don&rsquo;t like being called &#8220;honey&#8221; or even &#8220;miss&#8221;.  But I live in the South and keep reminding myself that people mean no disrespect by terms like &#8220;honey&#8221; or &#8220;dear&#8221;.  Fountain probably goes around imagining insults all day!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a racial issue, Bud.  My father was &#8220;Mr&#8221;, and it annoys me that I am not.  Especially aggravating are the bank tellers who call me by my first name.  I have had to ask them, &#8220;Is my last name there on your screen too?&#8221;  If it bothers you as much as it bothers me, Jack, correct them.  If you get any lip, talk to their supervisor.  No adult has to accept being familiarly addressed by a kid.  </p>

		<p>This gentleman needs thicker skin. Unless he takes the time to correct those addressing him or to wear a name badge that he can silently point to, he has no room to grumble. There are people of varied maturity in our stratified society. Live with it or lock yourself in your domicile and never emerge to be mis-addressed again.</p>

		<p>I will call you sir when you earn that honour. Respect is reciprocal. When you stop calling each other n#$$%# and reduce the streets to violence. When you stop whining about slurs and start creating families not on welfare and include a father. When you stop taking our hard earn tax dollars and work for a living even when you don&rsquo;t feel like it. When you follow the rules, I believe it will be better for both your race and mine. I would be honoured then to call you sir.</p>

		<p>That chip on your shoulder must weigh a thousand pounds, Fountain. Perhaps a few sessions with a psychologist or counselor could help you get over your inflated sense of self worth. We live in a pretty casual world, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, and people adress each other informally in most circumstances. If you want to return to the era of social norms that included formal address, you&rsquo;ll have to go back to segregation and Jim Crow. </p>
<p>Remember, Mr. Fountain, because racism and segregation in the America of the 1950&rsquo;s was SO reprehensible, your people had to destroy the very underpinnings of civil society in order to get your &#8220;equal rights&#8221;. Well, now that you&rsquo;ve got them, don&rsquo;t go around bemoaning the lack of courtesy. Such pleasantries were the hallmarks of a civilized society, one that was racially aware and segregated. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Bud&#8221; when used amongst white men with each other, is actually a term of endearment. It&rsquo;s like a more blue-collar way of saying &#8220;friend&#8221;.</p>
<p>Are black men so innately feminine or sensitive that to be called &#8220;bud&#8221; is really embarrassing? And, to think, black men are a group that are constantly being propped up by the media and Hollywood as the &#8216;epitome of masculinity&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I guess the solution here is for whites to simple quit interacting with blacks at all and to talk to them bluntly in a cold, dry business, monotone voice from now on&hellip;</p>

		<p>I can assure this &#8216;racism under every rock&rsquo; professor that young blue collar males who say &#8216;bud&rsquo; use it on older white males, too.</p>
<p>And for Mr. Fountain&rsquo;s information, today it is whites who must cross streets and avoid looking blacks in the eye for their own personal safety. I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Fountain loses a lot of sleep over that fact.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a racial thing, it&rsquo;s just part of the unfortunate erosion of general ettiquite. While I haven&rsquo;t heard &#8220;Bud&#8221; much around here (Northern Virginia,) I&rsquo;ve been addressed as &#8220;Dude&#8221; more times than I can remember or wish to count. </p>
<p>I put this in the same category as the day &#8220;thank you&#8221; was officially replaced by &#8220;no problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The &#8220;respect&#8221; he wants is for people to walk on eggshells around him as if he was a lord.  Apparently the term &#8220;Buddy&#8221;, used by White Americans as a common social endearment, is an insult in the Black American community.  Why?  Maybe because being counter to White American culture is where Black Americans prefer to be.  For them the rules of White Americans do not apply except by force of law, it is rare to see common courtesy and a desire to lift society at large as much of a Black American goal.<br>

		<p>Minus the racial angle, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s being overly sensitive.  I am in the service industry and I would not address a customer as &#8220;Bud,&#8221; &#8220;Buddy,&#8221; or &#8220;Pal.&#8221;  Nor would I tolerate that anyone working for me address a customer that way.  It&rsquo;s a rude and low-class form of address.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think it&rsquo;s inappropriate to address an adult by his or her first name without first being invited to do so.</p>

I have the solution. A line of name tags marketed exclusively to blacks. That way when we meet them, we can know how each individual black person wants to be addressed.</p>

		<p>Well Mr. Fountain.  Or should I call you BUD.  Respected is EARNED.  There is no other way to obtain it.   Unfortunately most blacks want it all handed to them.  Free of charge. Respect is not obtained by complaining and whining.  Men who are quite sure of themselves don&rsquo;t care what they are called, because they know the truth.  Those who demand special titles are trying to cover up their many insecurities.  This article by John W. Fountain is an advertisement for his insecurities and shortcomings.  </p>

		<p>So, Mr. Fountain, you&rsquo;ve discovered the new, post-counter culture revolution America?</p>
<p>Manners, civility and gracious behaviour were judged habits of the imperialist culture and done away with.  We are all comrades now.  There is no respect for individual, rank, position, age, gender or anything else.  We are all just homogenous proletariat now; objects of convenience for the state.  To call you, &#8220;sir&#8221; or &#8220;Mr.&#8221; is patriarchal, reactionary and oppressive.  Such titles are meant to demean or diminish the user and promote subservience.  </p>
<p>But, until the transition is complete, you have to put up with the irritating slang used by everyone.  It&rsquo;s a price we pay for deconstructing the old reactionary order.</p>
<p>Thank the party you probably vote for, for these changes in society.  They promoted it, so you need to go along with it.</p>

<p>What I think he wants is Federal Hate Speech laws, directed strictly at Whites, making innocuous words such as &#8216;bud&rsquo; or &#8216;dude&rsquo; punishable by hard prison time, loss of job, smearing of reputation.</p>
<p>This aggrieved Angry Black Male has the current Justice Department, whose main goal is to ferret out  and destroy The Great White Bigot, solidly on his side.</p>
<p>Then, he will have the power to lord over Whites, as Whites, and only Whites, are shackled, stifled and shut-up by federal Hate Speech laws that subject them to harsh punishment for any comment perceived by non-Whites as racist in nature.</p>
<p>The best course of action, always, is to avoid blacks whenever and wherever possible.  You will never win and anything you say, no matter how innocuous, may be perceived by them as White racism.</p>

		<p>No doubt for every young White male that has the temerity to address Mr. Fountain as &#8220;bud&#8221; there are 50 young black males referring to a White man, minding his own business, as &#8220;muther-f-er&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps professor Fountain will write a column on this post-racial endearment so frequently used by his kinsmen.</p>

Harden up bud! You poor little thing&hellip;<br>
I&rsquo;ve been called all sorts of things - I personally hate being called &#8220;man&#8221;, but big deal! I also hate been called &#8216;love&rsquo; by females much younger than me at the counter, but it&rsquo;s still better than a sullen, &#8220;huh?&#8221;<br>
Maybe the &#8216;Professor&rsquo; should come down to my wpokplace one day - all a laugh, but I&rsquo;d guarantee he&rsquo;d be relieved to be called &#8216;bud&rsquo;.</p>

<p>All MUST read the original article comments, and older woman, 60&rsquo;s corrects his grammar - hilarious. Oh yes, truly this legend is no mere result of decades of racial preference. His own collegiate web page lauds him as many things, but leaves out the best descriptor - a bigot. </p>

		<p>While Mr. Fountain busies himself tire shopping or scanning the shelves at Lowes for a toilet flapper valve, he may want to take note that the cultural norm in which we express fraternal friendship by addressing complete strangers with familiar terms such as &#8220;Bud&#8221; is the same cultural climate that engendered prosperity, affording all of us the abundance of goods and services that make our nation the envy of the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps he would be more comfortable in sub-Saharan Africa where his cousins earn $300 per annum, per household and where indoor toiletry is a luxury  &mdash;  but they will call him &#8220;Mister&#8221; and &#8220;Sir&#8221;.</p>

I can assure this &lsquo;racism under every rock&rsquo; professor that young blue collar males who say &lsquo;bud&rsquo; use it on older white males, too.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>If this Mr. Fountain were any sort of REAL journalist or REAL professor he would, at the very least, conduct a small survey to determine if he was being called &#8220;bud&#8221; at a rate greater than that of whites. He might enlist a white colleague to join him in an experiment of counting the number of times within, say, a month or two,  each of them was called &#8220;bud&#8221; by a stranger. If it did indeed turn out that the black man was being addressed more informally and rudely than the white man   &mdash;   something I seriously doubt, BTW   &mdash;   then he might some basis for an article of this kind. Even a brief, informal comparison of such raw data, however inconclusive or non-scientific, would provide him with a more solid basis for his allegations of &#8220;racism&#8221; than what he offers here.</p>
<p>Which is nothing baseless, worthless opinion-mongering from what sounds like a paranoid child suffering from a persecution complex.  </p>
<p>But doing even a small comparitive study of this kind would, of course, require actual thought and actual effort. So much easier just to plunk yourself down in your comfortable, ergonomically correct (white-designed) chair at your state-of-the-art (white-invented) computer in your impressive (white-built) office building and type up yet another silly screed against the evil white man. </p>

		<p>Blacks just love adding to the list of things white people can&rsquo;t say. Catch a white saying one of those things, you can have him fired from his job, sue him for all his worth, tarnish his reputation, violentally assault him and get acquitted, and otherwise have your way with him. The original words white people couldn&rsquo;t say to blacks are obvious, and perhaps &#8220;You People&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;nappy headed&#8221; seems to be the latest ones. </p>
<p>But if they can get &#8220;Bud&#8221;, &#8220;Buddy&#8221; and &#8220;dude&#8221; added to the list of forbidden words then they would have a field day. It would be a golden age of discrimination lawsuits, groveling Don Imus style, public apologies by by hapless terrified groveling whites and black arrogance and pompousness would reach stratospheric new heights. <br>

		<p>This has nothing to do with race but with our too-casual ways when it comes to manners in some places.  I do agree that a service worker calling a man bud is too informal. I live in Texas and I have never heard anyone, White or Black, addressed as &#8220;bud&#8221; or &#8220;dude&#8221; by service workers, it&rsquo;s always sir or m&rsquo;am. These terms(bud/dude} are only used among people who know each other and are friends here. I do agree that that service workers should call their customers sir or m&rsquo;am and that bud is too casual. I believe in more formal manners such as Mr.Jones/Ms.Jones as opposed to the too casual ways we sometimes have today. Also, as another woman on here said, I as a woman am usually referred to as m&rsquo;am but in a few bars, the bartender might call you hon/sweetie which is not meant to be offensive but I still find a tad so since I don&rsquo;t know you.</p>

		<p>A lot depends on whether Mr. Fountain is in a store as a customer or not. If he doesn&rsquo;t get due respect as a customer, he can shop elsewhere   &mdash;   and let the store manager know why he does so. Perhaps a letter to the manager would be appropriate.</p>

		<p>Hey bud! Get over it! What a cry-baby&hellip;.</p>
<p>Grob, excellent post. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to put words to the behavior I see from blacks on a daily basis&hellip;&#8221;walk on eggshells&#8221; is exactly how they want whites to act. </p>
<p>To everyone else, I will say that respect requires two-way support. I use &#8220;sir&#8221; and &#8220;ma&rsquo;am&#8221; without fail, yet I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times other people have been humorously dismissive of my &#8220;formality.&#8221; I know they aren&rsquo;t criticizing me, but young people who observe that interaction get a conflicting message about respect and deference. </p>
<p>I also open doors for women, no matter their apparent age or physical ability. Believe it or not, there are women who get huffy, as though my courtesy is some unspoken accusation of infirmity. I don&rsquo;t take it personal, but what message is the young man who&rsquo;s looking on going to get?</p>
<p>When a woman arrives at, or walks away from, a table at which I&rsquo;m seated, I stand. That one&rsquo;s always good for a laugh. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been the only guy to do it, and how many women start looking around, wondering what&rsquo;s going on. </p>
<p>We have to accept good manners, as well as display them.</p>

I think it is overfamiliar and lacking in the respect and courtesy that should characterize customer relations. But I don&rsquo;t think it qualifies as racist. Fountain&rsquo;s complaint about the term is legitimate in that it can be rude under some circumstances, but it has nothing to do with race. By trying to make into a racial issue, he identifies himself as just another black looking for reasons to be offended.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I cannot shake from my mind the stories I have heard from black men like my grandfather of the way we used to have to cross the street in the South to let whites pass; how black men could not look whites in the eye, or how, sometimes to survive we had to kowtow, yessuh or shuck-yuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nowadays it is whites that have to cross the street and us that have to avoid eye contact for fear of offending or &#8216;disrespecting&rsquo; them. <br>
This whole article seems to suggest that blacks are pushing for far more than equality. What blacks now want from us is deference.</p>

		<p>What in tarnation is a &#8220;Loop elevator&#8221;? </p>
<p>Anybody? Anybody have any ideas? </p>
<p>This is a little off-topic, but my first thought of what he meant by going on a &#8220;Loop elevator&#8221; was that while running errands and being emotionally lynched by the white male at every step, maybe in his travels he took a ride on that classic European-designed elevator you step-on or step-off of,  the &#8220;paternoster.&#8221;  ( tiny.cc/S37z4 ). </p>
<p>Obviously in the place where this man does his daily business, a paternoster would be impossible. </p>
<p>Today these types of elevators are absolutely inexistent in the US, and operate in just a few last locations in Europe. The reason such an ingenious invention can&rsquo;t be used any more? </p>
<p>1) People are too stupid to use them; </p>
<p>2) The price caused by said stupid people of repairs and law suits. </p>
<p>Does anybody remember back in the early 80s in Europe, when the vast majority of elevators you took were 1/4 open?, meaning you could watch the wall of the elevator shaft and the doors you passed going up or down?  </p>
<p>In my building in Paris, I had a 1/4 open elevator until the mid-1990s. It was a very small elevator and I lived on the 5th floor. It was cool and liberating to be able to watch the floors glide by vertically, but some time around 1995 they installed in the tiny elevator cabin a ridiculous clunky motorized accordion door (that was always breaking, causing long outages of a perfectly good elevator). This happened to all the buildings in Paris around that time. Including some with some incredibly beautiful Art-Deco elevators. </p>
<p>In Iceland in 2003 I was happy to ride in a 3/4 open elevator in Reykjavik, but I have not seen one since. </p>
<p>I could go on and on about common-sense conveniences being lost due to an ever lower quality of general citizenry throughout the West, but as this is a bit off-topic already, I will refrain. </p>
<p>I would however like someone to tell me what, in this man&rsquo;s low-wattage mind, is a &#8220;Loop elevator.&#8221; </p>

		<p>To me it looks like he sat down to write his column and was stuck for a subject and so thought one up.  When I was working in the USA (legally) in the late 1960s as an aircrfat engineer at McDonnell Douglas, I used to introduce myself to new friends or associates as a &#8220;Limey&#8221; and some looked embarrassed as if I was insulting myself, but soon realised that I had every right to be pleased to be called a &#8220;Limey&#8221;.  I also did not find one American who knew the origin of the name &#8220;Yank&#8221; but I also did not find one black person who was willing to be remotely friendly, even new neighbours in the up-market home we rented for the two years while there.  All seemed to have a chip on their shoulder.    If anyone is interested I can advise where Limey and Yank came from.  </p>

<p>Now I did have a black co-worker once who would get her neck swinging, her finger wagging and spend five minutes screaming at you if you dared call her any of those things. Of course, she would involve racism with it if the person who was being screamed at wasn&rsquo;t also black. </p>

		<p>It would be nice if white people would stop calling this man &#8220;Bud&#8221; or &#8220;Buddy&#8221; because in his own words he has stated that he certainly is not and I believe him. He is no one&rsquo;s buddy and probably hates white people in the first place. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually possible to call a man &#8220;Sir&#8221; with no respect what-so-ever. A little trick I picked up in the military. It&rsquo;s also a good way to keep people at a distance and show no friendship at all and just what this guy is looking for. </p>
<p>The more blacks want to seperate themselves the better I like it. The races need to be segregated and I don&rsquo;t care who makes the decision to do so. Call him Sir, sell him his toilet valve and send him on his way with no sign of friendship. He can&rsquo;t even whine about being called Sir but will still know he&rsquo;s not welcome at my house. </p>

<p>Chicago&rsquo;s downtown district is known as &#8220;The Loop&#8221;, and has been for decades. One of the city&rsquo;s public transit elevated rail lines starts from the northwest side, and proceeds south until it hits downtown. Then, it will proceed to go west, a few blocks until it goes north again.</p>

		<p>I avoid any interactions with non-whites when I can, even when they show an obvious openness and even friendliness precisely because of the personality displayed by a Mr. Fountain. These types are the wall builders who do not want integration, but reverse segregation, with whites forced to the back of the bus, etc. Their hatred of whites is deep and no amount of &#8220;reparation&#8221; or apology will uproot it. They resent the historical dominance of whites over, well&hellip;, everybody and seem to regard the reformations that granted them the many rights and special privileges they now enjoy as insult - reformations accomplished primarily by whites - perhaps precisely because they were conferred by whites out of intellectual and moral generosity and were far from rights won by merit.</p>
<p>I suppose pursuit of this &#8220;ideal&#8221; of a non-white dominated world may seem more fruitful than their integration into a civilized, and civil, world has been, which they have steadfastly resisted from the first day, ever harkening back to their primitive origins, notwithstanding that it was white man who extricated them from that enduring mire and all its nightmarish brutality.</p>
<p>All races have experienced travail and oppression. In many parts, they still do. In Africa the per capita income is something like $300 per year and &#8220;necklacing&#8221; refers to putting a burning tire around your neck. Corruption and human rights violations are beyond rampant. It&rsquo;s a real horror show.</p>
<p>If Mr. Fountain wants to establish residency in the Republic of Congo, he is free to do so. If not, he should be happy to be a black man in America. He&rsquo;s got every advantage and any excuse at his fingertips.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll kill off three etymological questions pronto.</p>
<p>1) Limeys are called such from the inordiate amount of limes British naval forces ate to prevent them from getting scury.</p>
<p>2) A general term for Nordics in early, early America was &#8216;Jan (pronounced &#8220;Yon&#8221;) Kaas&rsquo;, referring to the newcomers&rsquo; propensity for making cheese.  Say the two words fast enough and you&rsquo;ll hear &#8220;yankees&#8221; in there to refer to Northerners. </p>
<p>3) In Chicago, a &#8220;Loop elevator&#8221; is simply one of Mr. Otis&rsquo; lifting devices that is used in a building inside the downtown &#8216;loop&rsquo; created by the ring of elevated trains that take Chicagoans to work or shopping or to be mugged.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;for every young White male that has the temerity to address Mr. Fountain as &ldquo;bud&rdquo; there are 50 young black males referring to a White man, minding his own business, as &ldquo;muther-f-er&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>

#26 gets the award for best comment, though all comments in the spirit of &#8220;How &#8216;bout we just don&rsquo;t address you at all in the first place?&#8221; are right on.</p>
<p>Do you suppose blacks  &mdash;  even relatively educated ones like Bro Fountain  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t get it? Or are they so consumed with their hatred of whitey that they just don&rsquo;t care?</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me because it is the kind of petty nonsense black people like to pull.  I even go out of my way to avoid treating black patients.  When I see a name like &#8220;Washington&#8221; on the roster, I go out of my way to make sure that someone else, preferably someone not white, does that patient&rsquo;s anesthesia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind being called by first name by patients or anyone else because I don&rsquo;t think that informality is rude and always correct those calling me &#8220;Doctor&#8221; by telling them that I am not an M.D..  In fact, excessive politeness is often people&rsquo;s way of telling you that they don&rsquo;t like you and don&rsquo;t want to be friendly.  What I do mind is hearing some black guy complain about racial insensitivity after behaving in such an ungentlemanly manner with my nurses.  If he wants his nurse calling him &#8220;Mr. whatever,&#8221; he has no business calling her &#8220;Yo&#8221; followed by something you don&rsquo;t call a lady.</p>

		<p>I am surprised so many here think using first names is inappropriate, in modern business it is 99% first names. I am in sales and call executives all day long, it is always &#8220;Sir&#8221; or &#8220;John&#8221; but never Mr. unless others in the company refer tot hem that way (very rare).</p>
<p>Now what is VERY bad manners is referring to ONESELF as Mr. or Mrs., that is technically incorrect, in fact I have told customer service workers it is &#8220;ghetto&#8221; because in fact it is usually ghetto blacks that think it makes them sound important.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The offenders most often are white&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This means that some of the people who call him &#8216;bud&rsquo; are black. Yet the article proceeds as if this is not the case, and that the term is used solely by whites against blacks as a racial slur. I have noticed that in a lot of articles on Amren, paticularly by blacks, there are examples of such muddled and seemingly obfusticating writing. This means they get away with writing things that have a lot of implicit anti-white sentiment, as this one does. Usually people are too wary of being accused of being racist to question them more deeply and pin down exactly what they mean. If I were an interviewer on CNN I would ask him the following-</p>
<p>Does it annoy you when blacks call you bud, or is it just whites?</p>
<p>If it annoys you equally when blacks call you bud, what is the reason for this, seeing as in the article you say it bothers you for racial reasons?</p>
<p>If it only annoys you when whites say it (which I think is the truth you are avoiding explicitly saying) are you not effectively saying that you demand more respect from whites than you do from blacks  &mdash;  and also more respect from whites than we give to each other?!</p>
<p>In other words, is this article not a thinly-veiled demand to be treated as a racial superior in order to make up for perceived past injustice?</p>
<p>In the &#8216;bad old days&rsquo; you hark back to, would whites have called you &#8216;bud&rsquo; anyway? Isn&rsquo;t the truth that you invoke these days simply as a way of explaining your deep-seated insecurities about whites in relation to blacks?</p>
<p>This is the problem: blacks demand equality, but look at history and the real world and realise that no such equality exists. Therefore when whites try and treat them as equals it sounds patronising and makes them madder than ever. What is the solution to this problem? I once knew a guy who was very hard, and very stupid. One time he got drunk with us and his paranoia and resentment came to the surface and he started threatening us. Making us scared of him was all he had. This is why blacks demand deference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame all whites could not agree to make a point of only referring to other whites as &#8216;bud&rsquo;, and call all blacks &#8216;sir&rsquo;. How long before the first article by a black man complaining about this new, racist trend?</p>
