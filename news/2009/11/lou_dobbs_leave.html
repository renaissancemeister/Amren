<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lou Dobbs, a CNN anchor known for his strong views on immigration, said his show Wednesday was his last for the cable-news network.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs has been a divisive figure both inside and outside Time Warner Inc. He used his show to promote his views on illegal immigration, and kept alive questionable assertions about President Obama&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs is a proponent of strict enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.</p>
<p> &#8220;Some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem-solving,&#8221; and &#8220;to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible,&#8221; Mr. Dobbs said on his show.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs reserved kind words for CNN, saying he was &#8220;proud&#8221; to help build Atlanta-based CNN from its inception. &#8220;I&rsquo;m the last of the original anchors here on CNN.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091112/US.TV.Lou.Dobbs/">John King to Be Replacing Dobbs&rsquo; Show on CNN</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Comcast News, November 12, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Jon Klein, CNN president, said Thursday that veteran reporter King will move into the 7 p.m. EST slot that&rsquo;s been vacated by Lou Dobbs. King will host a show about politics beginning early next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dobbs announced abruptly Wednesday evening that it would be his last show on CNN. He said he wanted to pursue more advocacy journalism, a route that was no longer available to him on CNN.</p>
<p>King has been a top political reporter at CNN since 1997, when he joined from The Associated Press. He hosts the Sunday program, &#8220;State of the Union,&#8221; which he will be giving up early next year.</p>
<p>He said Thursday that he wants his show to bring more depth to issues, to get beyond a phrase like &#8220;public option&#8221; to explain what it really means. There will be provocative discussions, and guests with many different opinions will be welcomed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to do what I think needs to be done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think over time that viewers, if they compare and contrast, will be getting more meat&#8221; from his show than his competitors.</p>
<p>The Washington-based show doesn&rsquo;t have a name yet. He wouldn&rsquo;t comment on Dobbs&rsquo; exit: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see any value today in looking into the rearview mirror,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dobbs had become a target of criticism from liberal and Latino advocacy organizations for his campaign against illegal immigration, and sparred with CNN management over the summer when he talked about questions over President Barack Obama&rsquo;s birth site after CNN reporters had found nothing to substantiate the issue. CNN management pressed Dobbs to keep his opinions to himself  &mdash;  at the same time Dobbs was doing an unrelated daily radio show as a commentator on various issues.</p>
<p>He said he was leaving CNN to pursue new opportunities. While those are unclear, he vowed to be a leader in the &#8220;national conversation&#8221; to restore &#8220;inspiration to our great free society and our market economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a CNN original, signing on when the cable network started in 1980. For much of that time, he hosted a nightly business broadcast that became one of the most influential shows in the corporate world, and CNN&rsquo;s most profitable show for advertising revenue.</p>
<p>But Dobbs said his world view changed after the 2001 terrorist attacks and corporate corruption scandals, and he began to more freely express his opinions. He was particularly persistent in bringing the immigration issue to the fore, winning him both higher ratings and enemies. Latino groups had an active petition drive seeking his removal.</p>
<p>His presence became awkward for CNN, particularly as it began emphasizing that it was taking a non-biased approach to contrast with MSNBC and Fox.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tom Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the leading Latino legal organization, said, &#8220;The Latino community can and should celebrate that Lou Dobbs is no longer on CNN.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat from Dobbs&rsquo; home state of New Jersey and the Senate&rsquo;s only Hispanic member, called it &#8220;addition by subtraction&#8221; for CNN.</p>

<p>CNN unbiased? Thats a laugh riot there. The CNN coverage of the conservative &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; movement was openly hostile, as is their coverage of anti-illegal immigration groups or individuals. CNN has become as openly far left as NBC/MSNBC. <br>

		<p>I agree with poster 2 that Dobbs is no pro-White advocate. In fact just the opposite. The only thing he is against is ILLEGAL immigration and has no objections whatsoever of the LEGAL 3rd worlders pouring into this nation for the last 50 years. He also had alot of lefties on his show and Mark Potok of the SPLC a few times which totally turned me off to Dobbs.</p>

		<p>A way to appreciate Lou Dobbs&rsquo; unique voice in the debate on illegal immigration would be to go to Google Videos and type: &#8220;Dobbs&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Illegal Immigration&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sample a few of the 546 video clips that turn up. </p>
<p>Try to imagine, for example, a Sean Hannity or a Rush Limbaugh or a Bill O&rsquo;Reilly devoting a segment to an obscure, but vitally important issue such as birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens:<br>

		<p>While I did occasionally enjoy Lou&rsquo;s program, most obviously his focus on illegals, he was hardly an open friend to the White race. The problem of &#8220;immigration&#8221; isn&rsquo;t whether it is legal or not - the problem is an invasion of alien peoples into a White-founded nation, drastically changing and upending the population demographics and cuasing untold damage along the way. </p>
<p>Yes, Dobbs was probably one of the best on mainstream televison - but in all reality, he always came up WELL short of telling the truth and supporting Whites in any real demonstrable way. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves about these things. </p>

		<p>One more reason to hate the mainstream media.  Although Lou Dobbs has no objection to massive legal immigration his mere objection to illegal immigration was enough to get him pushed out of television news by the SPLC, La Raza, and their allies in CNN&rsquo;s management.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch television, I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any newspaper, and I hope they all go bankrupt.<br>

		<p>If  John King, a previous White House journalist is taking over from Lou,  he better not muffle free-speech on the illegal immigration invasion. I will watch just one program, to see if King hasn&rsquo;t been brain-washed by the Democratic &#8220;Fair Doctrine&#8221; secret law or the ability to speak out on everything. Then we have this &#8220;politically correct&#8221; asinine garbage, stopping people from speaking their mind. Just God help America and survival, owing to our corrupt government that is pushing the US worker into a corner, giving preference to foreign national labor. ME? I guess this is the last time I&rsquo;ll be taking an hour in the afternoon. Having lost Lou, this we give me more times to draft blogs about the illegal alien occupation of our nation?</p>
<p> If Lou Dobb&rsquo;s takes upon himself to join the ugly battle to commence on illegal immigration reform. There are rumors that he might finally fight an incumbent politician with a real chance of winning. He has a huge following of conservatives, republicans and Independents who are ready to join the war against the open border fanatics.</p>
<p>Without Lou Dobb&rsquo;s, Glenn Beck, O&rsquo;Reilly commentary Americans would never know about the cloaked agenda of the open border zealots. We would never know that the quasi government agency Council of Foreign Relations and the Federal Reserve banks are not in the best interests of the majority of the American nation. CFR main agenda is to flood America with the free stream of cheap foreign workers, as in Europe? brought the un-exaggerated truth about the 20 to 30 million illegal immigration invasion from every corner of the world? </p>
<p>I watch CNN (cable) every day  and never heard journalists mention anything about any specific indigenous people regarding the illegal immigration occupancy of our country. He only talk about the gigantic difference who came as newcomers, honestly through the inspection process and do not expect financial government handouts. Not stealing into America like thieves in the night, demanding rights and respect, that is laughable in the eyes of the majority of the legal population.</p>
<p>Some new immigrants wait in line for their visa to enter America, not make excuses because they cheated US workers of their jobs. Go home and come through the front door to be welcomed. Americans all live by the &#8220;Rule of Law&#8221; so why should people who overstay their tourist visa or just slip by the Border Patrol expect a welcome?  Journalist, news-anchors has a right to speak his mind and the US populace will fight any restrictions that deny that right. &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.&#8221;  Now these ethnic caucuses are pushing to silence  Not that the Liberal-Marxists in the Democratic leadership follow the law, anyway? They swear to protect and defend Americans from enemies Domestic and foreign and then intentionally under-fund the  &mdash;  REAL  &mdash;  border fence. Why don&rsquo;t these illegal aliens go home and try shoving this opinion down the throats of other world governments. NOT IN AMERICA?</p>
<p>My guess is that the perpetrators who let loose on Lou&rsquo;s home and family, were illegal alien gang members, who get away with bloody murder every day. Just look towards the  &mdash;  SANCTUARY CITIES  &mdash;  of San Francisco and Los Angeles. If you have the fire-power of these heinous gang bangers, you too would be intimidated? Pity Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s was not in Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s jurisdiction in Arizona, because he would have taken them out.  We have persecutors and chief of police, who turn a blind eye to illegal alien and criminals. IF THE POLITICIANS WANT TO FORCE UPON US ANOTHER AMNESTY. LET US ADOPT WORD-FOR-WORD, MEXICO&rsquo;S IMMIGRATION LAWS?</p>

		<p>Yet another victory for LA RAZA, and don&rsquo;t kid yourselves if you imagine it to be anything else,except perhaps a victory for the bankers also. Lou was exposing them both on a regular basis. However, most Americans continue to be little bothered by it all. It&rsquo;s been said before that people will not act unless they are forced into the most dire straights imaginable. This will come, because the elite in this nation have NO INTENTION AT ALL OF CHANGING THEIR CRIMINAL WAYS.</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs show was the only program I watched on CNN. Good to know I won&rsquo;t have to go back there ever again. While I agree with other posters that he wasn&rsquo;t excatly pro white, he was the only anchor on TV that kept pounding our problem with illegals.</p>
<p>The comments about his departure on CNN.com are just sickening. I&rsquo;m surprised mine hasn&rsquo;t been removed yet. While these liberal fools celebrate him leaving, they are being DISplaced and REplaced in their own country. Lets see how they feel in 40 years when whites become the minority, they have no political power, and are ruled by these invaders. FOOLS! ALL OF THEM!</p>

		<p>Lets face facts, other than Pat Buchanan, who else in the MSM ever speaks out against illegal immigration on a regular basis? <br>
Not Rush, or Beck, or Hannity.<br>
To say Dobbs was a failure because he did not speak about legal immigration is not constructive criticism. How many of you that chastise Dobbs for his failings have yet to join Numbersusa and send your first fax or make your first phone call to your Senator or donate to vdare or the Minutemen or make your opinion known to your local TV news or editorial board on the local paper? <br>
Dobbs did a patriots work and his focus in his best selling books  on the working class getting the shaft over trade deals and being sold out by our own governmemt should not be quickly forgotten. I would like to hear Rush and beck and hannity speak out as Dobbs did. Immigration is a tax on the working poor and is one Republicans rarely ever mention and is one Democrats refuse to even acknowledge,<br>
Dobbs is not perfect, nor is Buchanan, but God who else is commonly heard and allowed to speak out?</p>

		<p>Now that he doesn&rsquo;t have to appease anyone perhaps we will find out what Lou Dobbs really thinks.  It may be surprising.  I&rsquo;m sure many posters here who still have jobs often act like they accept the status quo out of fear of losing their jobs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They can, but should they? Is the &ldquo;Latino community&rdquo; against the concept of legal immigration?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, of course they aren&rsquo;t against the concept of legal immigration.  They are all for millions of mexicans crossing the border legally, multiplying fruitfully, receiving welfare and affirmative action, and ultimately supplanting whites as the dominant ethnic group in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the concept of &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; they are against.  They think it should all be legal, at least in so far as it pertains to them.  But fortunately for them, they&rsquo;ve found a loop-hole.  Have children, the more the better, and then welfare can be theirs with little chance of deportation.  Even if the elders are deported, the next generation is here to stay.</p>
<p>I think the legal/illegal dichotomy is a red-herring in so far as it pertains to non-white immigrants.  Lou Dobbs was no friend to whites, but at least he highlighted relevant issues in the immigration debate that weren&rsquo;t highlighted elsewhere in the mainstream media.  Whites who watched the program came away better informed, and most could make the mental leap from pernicious illegal immigration to pernicious legal immigration without needing it spelled out for them.  Now Dobbs is off the air, and latino community isn&rsquo;t even trying to hide their jubilation.  They&rsquo;re laying claim to America openly, and the only question now is how long whites are going to stand for it.<br>

		<p>I liked Lou Dobbs.  He was the first person to speak up against illegal immigration in any meaningful way.  I agreed fully with his stance on illegal immigration, although I want to also see  legal immigration reduced to a trickle (unlike Mr. Dobbs who has no problem with legal immigration in large numbers).</p>
<p>Anyway, I admire him for being the only one for a time to protest illegal immigration, and that is what got me interested enough to participate in the Minuteman rally in Washington DC in May 2006, that protested against amnesty for illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>Who are these posters?  Weird &#8220;trolls&#8221;?  I doubt that any have actually viewed CNN, daily,  in recent years.  It used to be a stodgy &#8220;down the middle&#8221; news channel, back in the Ted Turner days.  That was long ago.  Now, it&rsquo;s the Communist News Network.  Lou Dobbs was a holdover from the earlier times.  He went as far as he could, every day, to point out the ridiculous policies of the PC takeover, not just &#8220;immigration&#8221;.  I happen to live in a household where CNN is on a lot &amp; I inadvertently hear or view it often.  Who do you (I mean those quoted above) think is better, on the MSM TV garbage that so many watch with no comprehension?</p>
<p>Sheesh!  Pick a better target!</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not be too rough on Lou, guys. Yes, he&rsquo;s on record as being for a significant amount of legal immigration. He probably even believes in that. However, most of us got to our current positions on immigration/etc. gradually, right? We didn&rsquo;t wake up one morning browsing AmRen after watching CNN&rsquo;s &#8220;Latino in America&#8221; the night before.</p>
<p>Whatever his flaws, Lou exposed a massive number of people to the truth that our elites and government are absolutely out of step with the rest of us on the illegal immigration issue. He served (and still will serve) an important role and besides, isn&rsquo;t it a great metric as to your quality when the LaRazas and SPLCs of the world hate you, and will take such glee when you leave your network? It&rsquo;s basically a stamp of approval when the Hispanic advocacy groups don&rsquo;t like you; you can be confident that you&rsquo;re doing something right!</p>

One more reason to hate the mainstream media. Although Lou Dobbs has no objection to massive legal immigration his mere objection to illegal immigration was enough to get him pushed out of television news by the SPLC, La Raza, and their allies in CNN&rsquo;s management.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch television, I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any newspaper, and I hope they all go bankrupt.<br>

<p>WR the elder,</p>
<p>Sir, I agree with you completely. I got rid of the tv a few years ago and we&rsquo;ve been fine without it. As far as the newspapers are concerned, I still get them (NY Post &amp; Asbury Park Press), but only to keep up with their articles and continue my letters to the editor, many on which are never printed, but every so often I get one through. Otherwise, I agree with you 100%. It&rsquo;ll be a good day for our country when the newspapers go down completely.</p>

		<p>  Lou Dobbs for all his faults has been a steadfast opponent of Illegal immigration. In today&rsquo;s hypersensitive racial climate this takes real courage. He has a Mexican wife so this insolates him from some charges of racism. </p>
<p>How could he oppose legal Third World Immigration? Would CNN or any of the &#8220;controlled media&#8221; give him a public platform to do so? No, we can&rsquo;t expect anyone in the establishment mainstream to support all our positions&hellip; yet. We must try to parse our issues/problems incrementally  &mdash;   illegal immigration first, then move on to too many legal immigrants. Remember the privileged elites and big money are allied against us. </p>

		<p>The anti-Dobbs, pro-illegal crowd better celebrate hard and fast.  Word is, Lou is considering a job on Fox.  For months, I&rsquo;ve figured that would be the outcome of his spat with CNN.  <br>
CNN is now reportedly below Fox, MSNBC, and even Headline News in the ratings.  No surprise, since CNN has tried to be so nicey-nicey, bleeding-heart liberal that real lefties turned to MSNBC.</p>

		<p>This is real sad, I think. I think Lou Doobs is a good anchorman, and one of the very few at CNN who has any objectivity and integrity.</p>
<p>Now, CNN will be left with peple like Soledad O&rsquo;Brien, or the kind of reporter who produces special documentaries such as &#8220;Latino in America: when the minority became the majority&#8221;&hellip; The documentary in questionj implied that Latinon take-over was invitable and any White person who wanted to keep America Anglo-American, was a biggot and someone clinging to the past&hellip;</p>
<p>The thing is, CNN used to be a news network. Then, it became a leftist media. After that, it became something akin to Radio-Obama. Now, I see it as aa alien and hostile force, working against the interest of White America.</p>
<p>I guess Lou Dobbs understood too well what was goig on at CNN, and became a liability, so the Suits decided to get rid of mister Dobbs.</p>

		<p>Dobbs is gone from CNN.  The race hustlers won.  </p>
<p>I watched Dobbs from time to time and liked his hammering of the illegal alien issue.  This brought too much heat on whomever is running CNN. My guess is that big agribusiness as well as la raza had large influence in his demise.    </p>
<p>Dobbs never missed a chance to slam George Bush, deservedly so.  His criticism of Obama was much more muted, however. From this I think his politics is left of center.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck moved to FOX, maybe Dobbs will follow.  Beck at least slams Obama&hellip;&hellip;.a little.  But don&rsquo;t be fooled, Beck is a stealth leftist and an unrepentant multi-cult.  He never misses a chance to praise the likes of M.L.King and Gandhi and drool over their memory. King&rsquo;s face is portrayed prominently on Beck&rsquo;s entrance logo at the beginning of his FOX program.         </p>
<p>Beck is out to destroy the Republican party because he knows that the only opposition to the Obama agenda comes from Republicans, weak and ineffective as that is. He seems to be calling for a splintering of the GOP with a third party movement.  Slick way to further destroy whatever Republican opposition they can muster.   </p>
<p>Beck doesn&rsquo;t talk much about illegal immigration and the reason he doesn&rsquo;t is that he represents himself to be a libertarian.  He must be from the branch of libertarian that does not oppose illegal immigration. </p>
<p>With Beck and Dobbs at FOX, there is even less reason to watch that channel. Although Dobbs would be far less damaging than Beck to our cause. </p>

		<p>I think this is a good time to remind everybody that when we consume mainstream media, we increase its power.  </p>
<p>This is a good time to review whether you really need cable.  Until the freedom of the internet is ended (and it could end tomorrow), there is more and better information available on the net.  Let&rsquo;s savor it while we can, and print out hard copies of important information.  As I said, it could all be gone tomorrow.</p>
<p>At our house, the televisions sit in their packing boxes (sans convertors), waiting for us to watch a DVD.  Every week or so, I watch the weather, while on the Stairmaster at the gym.  And newspapers?  Mneh&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The New York Post has come out with some news that somewhat disturbs me, as a Dobbs fan (at least on TV, if he runs for office, I&rsquo;d have to be a lot more wary).  </p>
<p>Evidently, the big sticking point between he and CNN was the birther issue, CNN wanted him to nix the birther talk.  If Dobbs gathered up his marbles and went home over the birther issue, then I&rsquo;m rather disappointed in him.  Which is more important:  illegal aliens or some rumor about a birth certificate?  Especially since I think Obama himself (or David Axelrod told Obama) to hide his Honolulu birth certificate in order to create a pied piper distraction that the right wing would harp on instead of his rancid policy proposals.  Even if Obama wasn&rsquo;t born in the United States, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it anyway that (1) Won&rsquo;t be turned away by SCOTUS (Sotomayor is now a Justice), and/or (2) Makes moderate Democrats, who evidently hold the country&rsquo;s fate in their hands, mad.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cousin Charlie&#8221; and all of your ilk. You people are either very new to the idea of White Nationalism, or race-realism, or you are missing something in what many of us are saying, but you clearly don&rsquo;t understand what sites like AR are all about. Moaning and groaning about &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; does not an advocate for White people make! Dobbs doesn&rsquo;t care that there are now more than 40 million &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in this country - indeed, he makes that point crystal-clear every chance he gets! His only beef is the legality of it, and some underlying cocnerns about jobs, etc. He is ALWAYS careful to add that he has ZERO issues with the invaders themselves, and says not a word about legal immigration, which only further fills America with non-Whites. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Dobbs is a hopeless lickspittle when it comes to race - specifically Blacks. He never missed an opportunity to condemn race-realists(ie. &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221;), and often pandered to Blacks in a most unseemly manner. He can scarcely get through a show without soliciting the opinion of Blacks, often those openly hostile - either subtly or not - to Whites. <br>
I&rsquo;ve wathed Dobbs for YEARS and know this routine well.</p>
<p><br>
Just because someone on the television gets it right once in awhile doesn&rsquo;t make them a friend to our cause. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of &#8220;conservative&#8221; websites and such that may better suit some folks who believe otherwise. </p>
<p>I thought at AR Race was issue number one, and that we were all very clear about that. If this not the case, I as a subscriber to AR for over ten years have been seriously mislead! </p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs did nothing to help his fellow whites.  He would not defend whites one bit - even when it blatantly warranted it.  I will not miss him although he was better than most on mainstream TV.</p>
<p>If you want to turn things around for whites, start with the propaganda.  End it.<br>

		<p>Everyone STOP lamenting Lou Dobbs.  Like several have already pointed out, Dobbs is NOT one of us, in any way. People have got to stop making snap judgements about people who OCCASSIONALLY stumble across one of OUR talking points and agrees/supports the point (like Glenn Beck). In almost every other case, however, they do not step through the door. Dobbs would have no qualms about insulting AMREN and ALL of us for our other views. The fact that Dobbs made his career in the MSM is all I need to know about the guy.</p>

		<p>Lou Dodds was the only reason to watch CNN, the rest of its talking heads are routine liberal propaganda choirs. Bye-Bye.</p>
<p>MSNBC prime is a total garbage can - and apparently Matthews, Maddow, Olberman, and Mr. Ed couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled to be railing around in it&rsquo;s dirty bottom). I used to watch &#8220;Morning Joe,&#8221; but that soon gave off too much of the &#8216;progressive&rsquo; smell.</p>
<p>CNBC is a reasonably objective and very informative financial channel.</p>
<p>FOX news is right-biased but takes pains to present both sides of issues, and mostly avoids ad hominem insults (unlike the above first two cable networks, who revel in &#8220;humorous&#8221; slander of conservative figures as a permanent segment of their shows.</p>
<p>For those trying to avoid childish on-air partisan food fights fraudulently mislabeled as news, some Fox and C-SPAN is about all remaining which is reliable.</p>
<p>Half the time I turn it all off and run old &#8220;Equalizer&#8221; DVDs - to restore my sanity. </p>
