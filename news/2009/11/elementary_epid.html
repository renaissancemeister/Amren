<h1>Elementary Epidemic: 11 Uncovered Videos Show School Children Performing Praises to Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Nolte, Big Hollywood, November 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Big Hollywood has already posted a couple disturbing videos of young school children singing/speaking praises to President Obama, but when eleven more dropped in our email box it came as quite a shock. What seemed like an aberration now appears to be a troubling pattern.</p>
<p>Maybe &#8220;epidemic&#8221; is a better word.</p>
<p>Each one of the videos below is creepier than the last because the further down you go, the younger the children  &mdash;  brace yourself for kindergartners  &mdash;   except for the last and most disturbing video, which you have to see to believe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was some guesswork, but to the best of our ability the videos run from oldest to youngest, starting with high schoolers. We list the name of the school and the date the video was posted. From there, if it could be found (or a confident guess made), you&rsquo;ll find the schools&rsquo; website, followed by the original title given to the video and any notes added by whoever uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>Each video has also been transcribed so you can follow the bouncing ball .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>WEST HIGH SCHOOL  &mdash;  12-6-08</p>
<p>This is the school&rsquo;s probable website. What&rsquo;s going on here is explained below in the video notes.</p>
<p>Video Title: &#8220;Multico&rsquo;s Finale is Obama&rsquo;s victory speech!&#8221;</p>
<p>Video Note: Each year, MULTICO, a company of West High School students chosen to reflect the diverse ethnic and racial population of Madisons schools, tours elementary and middle schools with an original thirty minute production focusing on the concerns and experiences of children and adolescents in a multicultural, multilingual urban environment. MULTICO, a two hour a day English class, writes and performs a series of short sketches that highlight race, gender, sexuality and conflict, providing another tool for classroom teachers to use as we all work towards a more empathetic world.</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, today is your answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled  &mdash;  Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of red states and blue states; we are, and always will be, the United States of America.</p>
<p>So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.</p>
<p>The true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.</p>
<p>For that is the true genius of America  &mdash;  that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.</p>
<p>America, we have come so far. But there is so much more to do. This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time  &mdash;  to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and to restore the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can&rsquo;t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:</p>
<p>Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>Barack Obama  &mdash;  Recorded:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton&rsquo;s Army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas. I&rsquo;ve gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world&rsquo;s poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave-owners  &mdash;  an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.&#8221;  &mdash;  Barack Obama, &#8220;A More Perfect Union,&#8221; March 18, 2008.</p>

<p>Barack Obama  &mdash;  Recorded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of what we did on this day, in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kids:</p>
<p>Obama is fresh. Obama is cool. He has two daughters that like to go to school. It&rsquo;s hot outside, they jump in the pool.  [unintelligible] to follow the rules. Obama is President and has a new residence. There&rsquo;s people all around  who questions all the evidence.</p>
<p>Michelle wants her daughters to think their own things. She doesn&rsquo;t want their colors to do it instead. The 44th President of the USA because he beat Senator John McCain. Obama in charge of the oval office. He told Bush and his cabinet to get off this. A  &mdash;  a-a-a-aay. Obama is President of the USA-aaaay. Tomorrow&rsquo;s a new day  &mdash;  ay  &mdash;  ay- ay- ay. And we&rsquo;re living our life.</p>
<p>Barack Obama  &mdash;  Recorded:</p>
<p>&#8220;It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation&rsquo;s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Eleven is not yet a catastrophe but it is certainly a hint of what we will see in the future. Multiculturalism has always been most heavily promoted in elementary school so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that little kids are being indoctrinated into worshiping Obama, the man who overcame the most racist society in all of history. As the Jesuits used to say, &#8220;give me the child until seven and I will give you the man&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as Irish as bacon and cabbage and stew<br>
He&rsquo;s Hawaiian he&rsquo;s Kenyan American too<br>
He&rsquo;s in the white house, He took his chance<br>
Now let&rsquo;s see Barack do Riverdance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I find all of these videos heinous and vile, none quite compare to the filthy horror show that is: &ldquo;No One&rsquo;s as Irish as Barack Obama&rdquo; that I quote above. To begin with, it is obviously intended to promote miscegenation, when an evidently older male black child is surrounded by younger (mostly blonde) white girls as his &ldquo;backup&rdquo; singers, wailing this dismal propaganda. </p>
<p>Second, another level is punctured on this noxious boil of multicultural &ldquo;propriety,&rdquo; when an entire ethnic group of distinct white people are wantonly degraded, so as to make their very being subordinated to &ldquo;cute&rdquo; genocidal tolerability, for the aggrandizement of the Marxist demigod that is Comrade &ldquo;O&rsquo;Bama.&rdquo; One wonders, if all the arrangements here were reversed, and it was being noted that no one is as African as Eugene &ldquo;Terre&rsquo;Biko,&rdquo; what the reaction would be?</p>
<p>Enough said here, other than: that would be jolly good and kiss my O&rsquo;Blarney! </p>
<p>And of course, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Odd, the mention of God in a school performance doesn&rsquo;t seem to stir any anger as long as it&rsquo;s used in conjunction with the Big O.</p>

		<p>We keep trying to hold blacks up to a white standard.  In a tribal society of course you sing and dance to the chief.  It is their natural way.  And the white kid better go along if he wants to hear the dismissal bell.</p>

		<p>I agree that the videos get creepier and creepier because of the age of the children (but hey, it&rsquo;s all indoctrination, no matter what the age). There are so many sick and twisted sentiments in these &#8220;songs&#8221; but this line from the fourth video is one of the creepiest:</p>
<p><i> I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave-owners &mdash; an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters.</i></p>
<p>So now something that merely happened to your ancestors in the past is &#8220;carried in your blood&#8221; forever? Is this not a recipe for everlasting resentment, hatred, and vengefulness? You can never forget slavery, because after all, the slavery of your ancestors is &#8220;carried in your blood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Creepy indeed.</p>

		<p>I still think the song, &#8220;The future belongs to me&#8221; is a much better song for the Obama youth to sing. This is the song the Hitler youth sing in the movie Cabera.<br>
    I was going to write a song about BHO using the tune from Horst Wessel, but I was afraid that no one would get the joke.</p>

		<p>I may be premature in this assertion, but it certainly seems to me that the American variety of &#8220;Obamania&#8221; has already ebbed sharply in many quarters. The cult of personality that is Obama actually appears to be working against him politically. It has, for instance, made it far easier for the cowardly Republicans, who normally shudder at the thought of challanging a non-white on anything, to attack his policies and programs, if still remaining careful not to attack the man himself. But some getting bolder there as well. </p>
<p>But more importantly, the American people seem to have grown disillusioned with the annointed Mulatto-Messiah in recird time! Sure, many still haven&rsquo;t seen the light - but many more have and this particular false-idol will fade from glory just the like the rest in time. </p>

		<p>Every time I read more of this drivel, I get sick to my stomach.  Are they sneaking this trash into the schools, and the parents don&rsquo;t know about it, or are the parents complicit in the cultural rape of their own children?  To me, that&rsquo;s a form of abuse, to deprive their children of the right to feel pride in being white, instead of letting them think it is shameful and something to make sure society is rid of in a few more generations.  </p>

		<p>White people don&rsquo;t like Obama per se.</p>
<p>White people just feel good about themselves because they support a black man. Just a self-congratulatory pat on the back.</p>
<p>I wonder if Obama realizes this?<br>

		<p>Cult  of personality indeed. Note too that at least one credits CityYear Corps, an organization that has morphed into ObamaCorps. Watch out for them as if they were the Nazi Youth. Homeshool your precious children!</p>

		<p>A lot of the kids in these videos were black (and probably have black teachers or nitwit white liberal teachers, as well).</p>
<p>As such, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me so much.  They can worship Obama as a god incarnate, and make burnt offerings to him on an altar of brass, for all I care.  I don&rsquo;t really care what blacks do.  They ain&rsquo;t my people.</p>

		<p>I hope by now that everyone on this web site realizes that it essential to home school your kids.  The public schools are not merely ineffective at teaching real subjects.  They&rsquo;re very effective at indoctrination.<br>
