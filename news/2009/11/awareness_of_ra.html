<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most children actively notice and think about race. A new study has found that children develop an awareness about racial stereotypes early, and that those biases can be damaging.</p>
<p>The study, by researchers at Rush University and Yale University, appears in the November/December 2009 issue of the journal Child Development.</p>
<p>This study looked at more than 120 elementary school children from an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse area of the United States. Children were asked questions to determine their ability to understand another person&rsquo;s stereotypical beliefs as well as their own comprehension of broadly held stereotypes. They were also asked about their own experiences with discrimination. In addition, the children&rsquo;s parents completed questionnaires asking about their parenting.</p>
<p>Between ages 5 and 11, the researchers found, children become aware that many people believe stereotypes, including stereotypes about academic ability (for example, how intelligent certain racial and ethnic groups are). When children become aware of these types of bias about their own racial or ethnic group, it can affect how they respond to everyday situations, ranging from interacting with others to taking tests. For example, African American and Latino youths who were aware of broadly held stereotypes about their groups performed poorly on a standardized test, confirming the negative stereotype in a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results have important implications for social policy,&#8221; according to Clark McKown, assistant professor of pediatrics and behavioral sciences at Rush University Medical Center, who led the study. &#8220;Specifically, they suggest the need for educational policies and comprehensive programs to reduce stereotypes and their consequences early in children&rsquo;s school careers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This report states that the reason Africans fail is that society has a low opinion of them.  The article implies that if we tell Africans that they are geniuses that they will then excel academically.  Well guess what?  The have been trying that for the last 30 years, and there has been little change in African academic achievement.  The reason is that academic achievement is related to IQ, and Africans have a low mean IQ.  You can not more change the IQ of Africans by telling them they are smart, than you can change eye shape in Asians by telling Asian children that they have round eyes.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this at all. How can you &#8220;subconciously&#8221; pick the wrong answer on a test? You either know it, or you don&rsquo;t. This &#8220;self fulfilling prophecy&#8221; theory is totally illogical. </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t fake intelligence.<br>
	<br>
        We have a serious problem with the bureaucrats in this country who dismiss black failure in achievement as a social condition: when the reality is, that blacks simple lack the cognitive ability to function well in a complex society; black people are widely considered the most incompetent people on the planet for good reason; you can&rsquo;t fix the problem by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br>

		<p>I find this article confusing.</p>
<p>On the one hand: if knowledge of stereotypes causes poor performance, then where is the &#8220;control group&#8221;,i.e., a group of minority children who are unaware of the stereotypes, and who perform just fine?</p>
<p>On the other hand: if racial stereotypes are so powerful, is the<br>
&#8220;evil whites are to blame for everything bad under the sun&#8221;<br>
stereotype the cause of so much racial self-hatred among modern <br>
whites? </p>

		<p>  You can depress the scores of white children if you constantly tell them that they are horrible, evil racists,from a culture that is the root of all evil on earth and deserve to die.<br>
  It is past time that whites and any others who are not hateful racists that believe that whites are inherently evil stop trying to destroy whites and the benefits of white-not western but white culture for the whole world.<br>
   Again yesterday I was told by a white US Air Force Col that diversity was required for the US to succeed. He left with his wife telling him that it was everyone else that required whites to develop new inventions and ideas to benefit all people. His wife is Chinese. <br>

		<p>I am old enough to remember when few of us knew Asians were clever. In fact the only mention I heard of them when young involved racist limericks, or references to wars they were waging, or had waged, against us. Still, by high school, when GPA started couning, the Asian kids acquitted themselves well. As always the taunts and bias did not hold them back. </p>
<p>Some teachers voiced puzzlement over this outcome, attributing it to selection bias; others were just happy for a break from black/Latino trouble making  &mdash;  common here in SoCal. But no one broached the R-topic too openly.</p>

		<p>I wonder whether the affect of racial stereotypes has had the same effect upon the Polish americans as it has upon african americans. Does anyone even recall those old dumb polack jokes. Years ago when I really thought blacks were just as smart as white people my son at the age of eight asked me why black kids were so dumb. He came to that conclusion all on his own. The fact is white men have been stereotyped by the media as being stupid from Archie Bunker to Homer Simpson.  The fact is every time I turn on the television I see Black doctors and Black scientist and Black presidents. The question should be. Why after 30 years of propaganda about how smart blacks are that whites still consider blacks to be inferior in intelligence to whites. Occams Razor says blacks are just not as smart as whites.</p>

		<p>#1 has it right.  I would add that similar conditioning was tried among black criminals.  Liberal academic researchers thought black criminals had low self-esteem and that by giving them extra pride and praise for even the most minor of deeds they would change their ways.  Well as it turns out black criminals have plenty of self-esteem.  They think quite highly of themsleves and they tend to hold their victims in low esteem.<br>
And blacks in general have plenty of pride in their race and plenty of confidence.  Many blacks just ascribe low scores on tests to cultural bias and racism.  Most whites and Asians score higher on tests than most blacks but have lower pride, confidence and self-esteem than most blacks.  None of this matters though because political correctness dominates all research and no university professor will challange the pc orthodoxy.</p>

		<p>The word stereotype has negative connotations.  But if by stereotype they simply mean a recognizable pattern of behavior attributed to a class of people, then maybe they should answer whether the pattern is indeed completely false.  We are told sterotypes are bad, racist, or false.  But if the sterotype is false, how is it that so many immediately recognize the pattern.</p>

This sounds a lot like Claude Steeles&rsquo; &#8216;Stereotype Threat&rsquo;:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat</a></p>
<p>A few years back, PBS did a hit piece on the SATs based on the book, The Big Test.</p>
<p>They had an online posting and Mr. Steele responded to my posts. I asked for peer review articles. He gave me two both of which included him as a co-author. Somehow I believe he missed the point about independent peer review evaluation.</p>

		<p>Maybe 5 through 10 year olds are observing stereotypes because they don&rsquo;t have the sophistication to deny what they see.  By the time they are 15 they usually get wise enough to evade the pc police by denying what they see.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Orwellian.  Kind of like in Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 when Winston was asked how many fingers he sees and he thinks to himself &#8220;I see three, but I know I am suppose to see four, then he blurts out I see four.&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
The fact that the Blacks and Hispanics consistently perform poorly on a standardized test can also just as likely mean the stereotype is in fact true. What about the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics that do well on standardized tests? This article is just more liberal propaganda designed to continue the myth of racial equality in mental ability by shifting the blame for the disparity that exists over to the racial bias of whites. Just more of the same old blame game and excuse making is all this is.<br>

		<p> Aha! I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s why there are almost no White players in the National Basketball Association nowadays! All the coaches and scouts believe the negative stereotypes about how White athletes can&rsquo;t jump, or run fast, or aren&rsquo;t tough enough, or &hellip; or &hellip; something &hellip;</p>
<p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you know that the writer would choose blacks and Mexicans as the example of kids weighed down by &#8220;negative stereotypes&#8221;? Yes, of course, they score poorly on tests, etc., because they believe those negative stereotypes about blacks having lower IQs than Whites, etc. It reminds me of something Lyndon Johnson reportedly once said while president: &#8220;All this talk about high unemployment is just a nasty rumor started by a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t have any jobs!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Unfortunately differences show up much earlier than that. I think Jensen found in the g-factor that they showed up around age 3. Also, differences in brain size and other behavioural traits are reported from birth onwards.</p>

		<p>So blacks and latinos fail because they believe the negative stereotypes about them?  I think most whites today are self-hating and full of guilt, because they all believe like they&rsquo;re greedy, evil, hateful, and responsible for all the ills of this world.  </p>
<p>If someone tells you you can&rsquo;t do something, prove them wrong.  In the long run, it&rsquo;s your own damn fault  &mdash;  regardless of you race or religion or whatever  &mdash;  if you fail or succeed in life.  &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t succeed in life.  I don&rsquo;t want you to blame the white man.  I don&rsquo;t want you to blame your parents.  I want you to blame yourselves.  The responsibility is yours!&#8221;  From a black principal, Joe Clark.  </p>

		<p>Hope blooms eternal!   Either stereotypes are derived from reality or reality is derived from existing stereotypes planted by conspirators.   There is immense evidence for the former.   There is at least one concocted study (described herein) arguing for the latter position.  Recognizing reality and accepting, and ignoring stereotypes, is surely the most effective means of maximizing the performance of any individual.</p>

		<p>Yet another reason whites should be separated away from non-whites, so non-whites can be protected from the predations and malfeasance of the fwhites.</p>
<p>But &#8220;progressives&#8221; seem to hate non-whites; they go berserk when anyone suggests this simple solution.  What other explanation can there be for their fanatical devotion to racial integration (which is clearly harmful to non-whites), and their fanatical opposition to separatism (which would protect non-whites)?  Their actions speak louder than their words.</p>

		<p>BK reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I think Jensen found in the g-factor that they showed up around age 3&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes in Real Education (p. 51):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;We have no evidence at all that we know how to produce lasting increases in IQ scores after children reach school.  All the data about the trajectory of IQ scores over the life span indicate that they stabilize around ages six to ten and typically remain unchanged until old age&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Jensen and Murray (and Lynn and Rushton and MacDonald) have been throughly vilified by academia, the msm and the intelligentsia, despite mountains of hard, irrefutable evidence showing racial differences in brain size and IQ.</p>
<p>But instead of hard data, complied by researchers over decades, this is what gets published and disseminated:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;children become aware that many people believe stereotypes, including stereotypes about academic ability (for example, how intelligent certain racial and ethnic groups are)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because differences in intelligence between the races are not stereotypes, they are facts.  When White children become aware of the lower intelligence of blacks and hispanics, this knowledge must be squelched immediately by further brainwashing from the government-controlled schools.  </p>
<p>Do the researchers from Rush University and Yale University believe high levels of black violence to be mere stereotypes?  This is what the msm lead us to believe as they repeat the mantra &#8216;Race had absolutely nothing to do with it!&rsquo; when forced to report black-on-White mutilations and murders. </p>
<p>One ignores such &#8216;stereotypes&rsquo; at great risk:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;[Calle] replied, &#8216;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine. I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jamal Thompson, 22, was arrested early Thursday and charged with murder in the death of Eugenia Calle, 57&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Calle was killed by political correctness, which tells us racial differences are mere stereotypes, not to be believed. According to PC dogma, it is far better to ignore racial differences, die and forfeit one&rsquo;s life than appear the slightest bit racist.  </p>

		<p>Because of high attrition rates in adolescence blacks have remained more or less a steady fraction of the US population since the end of the Civil War. Their ability to damage society and the economy is limited so I can go along with the gag about pretending not to understand why they do so poorly on objective measures of mental ability. HOWEVER,Latinos are another matter. With their numbers ballooning across the country and their infiltration of nearly every part of the US they can and are transforming our nation into a dangerous idiocracy.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;From a Black Principal, Joe Clark&#8221;&hellip;<br>
It was this very movie that opened my eyes about how the media and movies in particular don`t show truthful reality. I`m talking about the scene in which principal Clark chains and locks the doors to the school to keep the drug dealers out and the students in. Three Fire trucks roll up with the Fire Marshal in tow. He demands Principal Clark unchain the doors. Clark replies he`ll do it only when the community gets rid of the threat of thugs accessing the school at all hours. The Fire Marshall mutters impotent threats and then retreats in defeat with his men.<br>
  And I sat in that theatre and went &#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; A man locks 600+ children in a public school with no chance of exit in an emergency, and a fire Chief with two dozen men, the jaws of life on any of his trucks, and the knowledge of potential danger along with the authority to break any door down  and possibly make arrests or call in police for back-up, backs off his No. 1 priority and leaves in defeat?!?! Not hardly!! The real scene would have shown him directing 6 of his men to quickly remove the doors off the hinges while the other 18 would keep  the three High School coaches from interfering with taking care of  business. Of course for the movies purposes of inculcating propaganda the principal was Black and the Chief a ruddy faced Irishman. I walked out of the theatre right then and there.  Walking to my car  I remembered the line from &#8220;The Towering Inferno&#8221; when Fire Chief Mc Queen is told by Bill Holden to not cause trouble and make Holden call his friend the mayor. McQueens rsponse, &#8220;Mister!, In an active fire, I outrank the mayor, and the President!&#8221; &#8220;I`ll be back Clark!&#8221;,indeed&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just a few years after the end of slavery at the start of world war one blacks were actually doing better on test than they do today. </p>
<p>I guess if I were a researcher I could make the conclusion that the only way to improve black test scores is to bring back slavery. </p>
<p>Even as a confirmed racist I won&rsquo;t make such a conclusion. Blacks did better on test in the early days because there were still black families that were intact and a will to do better. </p>
<p>President Johnson is responsible for poor black test scores because the more you try to help people the less they try to help themselves. Blacks have become totally dependant on being given special treatment so they no longer even try. </p>
<p>I say end affirmative action and welfare and black test scores will go back up or the black population will go way down because they will starve to death. </p>

		<p>The Roman Catholic Church always said that you give us your child for the first 7 years and you can have him for the next 70.  How many normal black people do black kids see on TV?   For every David Robinson there are a hundred dancing, rapping, robbing, killing,baggy pants dressing, nihilists. If kids only see black people behaving like clowns what are they supposed to think?   If your mother leaves you with granny five nights a week while she goes out to the clubs and spends more time corn rolling your hair rather than reading stories, by age 3 you think that you are too stupid to learn anything except cosmetology and crime.</p>
<p>     Cosby is the only black man this side of Farrakhan who understands that if you are surrounded by clowns and degenerates by age 18 months you will think that is what you are. All the steero-types about blacks are not stereo-types but correct reflections of reality where 75% of them are born out of wed lock. To paraphrase the Bard, &#8221; The fault dear black folk is not in your steero-types but in yourselves that you are America`s underclass.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I have many times seen blacks, usually women, say that low black achievement is caused by low expectations of them by Whitey.Kind of like they really are tuned into what we are thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t buy this at all. How can you &ldquo;subconciously&rdquo; pick the wrong answer on a test? You either know it, or you don&rsquo;t. This &ldquo;self fulfilling prophecy&rdquo; theory is totally illogical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Not to defend the premise of this article, there is a way that a testor could &#8220;subconsciously&#8221; pick a wrong answer.  If a student is intimidated by tests the added stress can make answer selection difficult, at least in a test like a multiple answer where the selections are very close.  I had a very clever professor in college who could construct a ten question test (in diagnosis) that was quite exacting and very stressful.  The testor had to know everything to answer six multiple choice questions and four true and false questions.  Worry of failure always plagued me because my father raised me with Great Depression stories and threats of life failure due to not working hard enough.  This plagued me all through my live and career. So when I finally went out of business due to having my office broken into and trashed by a Mexican gang in California, I saw his threats and predictions fulfilled, even though I know it was not my fault.  I guarantee you, I am white and have blue eyes. </p>
<p>Understanding psychology through both training and life experience, a self fulfilling prophecy can be a real thing that produces real results, as in the power of positive thinking; if enough people believe a nuclear war will occur in 2012, it will be more likely to happen.  If most people believe that we will have another, bigger recession in the near future, it will happen.  I have known many whites who had obvious failure predictions working inside them and they were failing.  The flipside of a political demise is an emotional political response, which is why so many posts on Amren contain an emotional quotient.  What you are participating in is termed &#8220;denial,&#8221; which is a refusal to objectively exam and make use of an experience, information, or some other subject requiring emotional and mental balance.</p>

		<p>the spooky thing about all these stories about the mystery of low test scores for blacks is that everyone seems to have wiped their hard drive clean:</p>
<p>50 years ago, we were told we needed massive, federally funded interventions to raise the cognitive performance, confidence, occupational success, etc., of blacks:<br>
 <br>
quotas in education &amp; hiring, massive recruitment drives by universities, etc., head start, experimental schools, busing, integration, social services, empowerment programs, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>Nothing worked, and now insetad of drawing up a balance sheet on this historic failure, we are just told we need to keep doing the same things over and over again.</p>
<p>What have we tried, what has worked, what has failed?</p>
<p>Adfter 50 years of massive governemt interventions, we deserve an answer. </p>

		<p>Many years ago, when I was still a wide eyed liberal in my first year of teaching I worked at an all black school. I made some typical liberal comment about how much potential the children had and a seasoned black teacher commented  &#8220;you know, black kids really are slower than white kids.&rdquo;  At the time I found his comment odd but now I know better. On occasion,  I hear similar comments from other black teachers.   Sometimes blacks are more honest about race than most whites are.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Specifically, they suggest the need for educational policies and comprehensive programs to reduce stereotypes and their consequences early in children&rsquo;s school careers.&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;  </p>
<p>How much more pervasive can the fraudulent propaganda be than it is now? </p>
<p>We need educational policies and comprehensive programs to make university social scientists understand that stereotypes are the result of a fundamental building block of intelligence called categorization. </p>
