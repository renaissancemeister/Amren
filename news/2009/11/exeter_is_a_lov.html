	<p>The Oscar-winner said her adopted son, Rwandan-born Tindyebwa Agaba, known to the family as &#8216;Tindy&rsquo;, had a &#8220;rough&#8221; time as a student at Exeter University and was subjected to racist taunts.</p>
<p>His experiences prompted Thompson to instigate a cultural awareness campaign on campus, aimed at promoting racial equality.</p>
<p>In a lecture on Thursday night, titled All Africans Now, she reflected on Griffin&rsquo;s complaint that the audience for his recent appearance on Question Time was drawn from &#8220;ethnically cleansed&#8221; London, a city &#8220;that is no longer British&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thompson said: &#8220;He&rsquo;d love Exeter. He would feel very comfortable here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked by one student: &#8220;What can we do to change the whiteness of Devon and Cornwall? How can we expand our university?&#8221; Thompson replied: &#8220;This is how we&rsquo;re doing it. Tindy had his experience and now we&rsquo;re having a big week of educational events to try and help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have to enthuse the entire student body, just as we are not going to eradicate racism in Cornwall this month.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;You&rsquo;re not going to get hundreds and hundreds of black students here overnight, but what you can do is make them more comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her remarks elicited a baffled response from locals. Jeff Coates, a Conservative councillor for Exeter, said: &#8220;Frankly, I find it extraordinary that she has these perceptions. It simply doesn&rsquo;t reflect my own perceptions of Exeter at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that Exeter is a very white city  &mdash;  it can hardly be blamed for being a provincial city, away from the major conurbations where many immigrants like to live. It&rsquo;s a very strange accusation to make. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, this is a country on the north-west fringes of Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do sympathise with her son and find it wholly deplorable that he was treated that way. You can&rsquo;t avoid the fact that there are bigots out there, but I doubt if that is any more common in Exeter than anywhere else.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a former teacher at the university and I was teaching predominantly Chinese and overseas students. It has to be said that the number of African students is relatively low and I can&rsquo;t understand why. Perhaps they don&rsquo;t find going to university in Exeter a particularly tempting prospect.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Exeter City Council spokesman said: &#8220;Whilst there will always be some people in our city who are not as racially tolerant as we would wish, there is no doubt that the economic, social and cultural life of Exeter benefits hugely from the rich ethnic diversity of the city, for which the University is a vital catalyst.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are an estimated 40 different languages being spoken in the city, including Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Mandarin, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Punjabi and Urdu. The University, Exeter&rsquo;s many language schools and the Institute of Arabic &amp; Islamic Studies also attract students from over 100 different countries every year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exeter&rsquo;s popularity as a tourist destination and as a location for large international companies also emphasises the growing diversity of the city  &mdash;  a diversity which we hope will continue to develop alongside the city&rsquo;s dynamic economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the key organisations in Exeter, across all sectors, are working hard to promote a positive response to ethnic diversity and to create a community which is tolerant and welcoming to all. We know there is work still to be done and that unacceptable experiences of the kind described by Emma Thompson do arise, but we are all determined to challenge them at every opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tindy, 22, graduated this summer with a 2:1 in politics and is now studying for a master&rsquo;s degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He brought the issue of racism in the Devon city to the foreground last year, when he wrote in an essay: &#8220;I find it incredible that I am the only African student in the entire politics department.&#8221; He described two incidents of racist abuse, one by a group of &#8220;nerds&#8221; and another by &#8220;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers&#8221; outside a nightclub.</p>
<p>Thompson and her husband, actor Greg Wise, informally adopted Tindy, a former child soldier, after meeting him at a Refugee Council Christmas party seven years ago. She told her audience that she hoped he would become Britain&rsquo;s first black prime minister.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Gerald Warner, London Telegraph, November 10, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>&#8220;What can we do to change the whiteness of Devon and Cornwall?&#8221; That pertinent question was posed by a student to actress Emma Thompson during her recent lecture entitled &#8220;All Africans Now&#8221;, delivered as part of her &#8220;cultural awareness campaign&#8221; at Exeter University.</p>
<p>The problem of the whiteness of Devon and Cornwall is certainly a challenging one. It seems strange that there should be pockets of pallid Caucasians still, in a country on the north-west fringe of Europe. Perhaps it is something to do with all that Devon cream they guzzle. Or more likely we are suffering the natural consequences of the Draconian restrictions on immigration so deplored by every Guardian reader.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is reassuring to know that La Thompson is on the case: it is a universal axiom that, if you want your cultural awareness raised  &mdash;  send for a luvvie [an affected, artsy type   &mdash;  AR editor]. Stephen Fry is engaged on similar work and even commands his own unit of Thought Police, capable of being mobilised at a moment&rsquo;s notice by a mere 140 characters on Twitter.</p>
<p>Thompson instigated her campaign in reaction to alleged racist abuse of her Rwandan-born adopted son while he was studying at Exeter; but his own account identified the abuse as coming not from dons or fellow undergraduates but from &#8220;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers&#8221; outside a nightclub. Many people might think such behaviour was more a characteristic of nightclub bouncers anywhere than of Devonians.</p>
<p>This problematic situation is reminiscent of the famous complaint by Greg Dyke, while director-general of the BBC: &#8220;I think the BBC is hideously white.&#8221; Of course, this provoked the usual reactionary suspects  &mdash;  retired brigadiers in bath-chairs in Torquay and members of the lumpen Caucasian proletariat to pose the loaded question: would he have described Brixton as &#8220;hideously black&#8221;? No doubt they will now ask similarly inane questions, such as: what would happen if someone enquired &#8220;What can we do about the blackness of London and the West Midlands?&#8221;</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t get it. That kind of speculation would be racist. To understand why, you need to be educated on issues of discrimination. Here again, we have a luvvie to the rescue. Only last month Jo Brand spelled it out on Radio Five Live: &#8220;You can&rsquo;t be racist towards white people.&#8221; Is nobody listening? It seems there is still a mountain of work to be done by Common Purpose, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the three main political parties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, that nasty, hideously white splodge at the bottom left-hand corner of the map of Britain is continuing cause for concern. Nor does even Emma Thompson imagine the problem can be sorted overnight. As she told her Exeter audience: &#8220;You&rsquo;re not going to get hundreds and hundreds of black students here overnight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; But it&rsquo;s not just the students that are the problem, is it? The wider challenge is implied in the question posed: &#8220;What can we do to change the whiteness of Devon and Cornwall?&#8221; Answers, please, on a postcard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>

		<p>Mom wants &#8220;Tindy&#8221; to be the first black Prime Minister? Since he feels uncomfortable around whites, does that mean whites would have to leave Britain? Frankly, any white in Britain who can leave should. Lunatics led by diversity freaks have taken over this once great nation.</p>

		<p>I dare Emma Thompson to go to the country of her adopted son&rsquo;s birth, find a major city, and start conniving to reduce its blackness.  </p>
<p>As an aside, I&rsquo;m getting kinda tired of the media whining about &#8220;child soldiers&#8221; in Africa.  What that means is that young teenage boys wind out becoming soldiers, perhaps voluntarily, but usually involuntarily.  But if you look at the UK or US, you will find black boys start ganging up in their early teenage years.  If you ask me, it&rsquo;s just Africans being Africans.  That we supposedly have an &#8220;obligation&#8221; to &#8220;rescue&#8221; &#8220;child soldiers,&#8221; former or current, means that we have to import every black boy or man over the age of 12.  As an aside, Rushton notes that a majority of &#8220;pure&#8221; black African boys have had their first sexual encounter by the time they turn 12, about the same time they become &#8220;child soldiers.&#8221;  The average white American, from the stats I&rsquo;ve been able to cull out, starts sex at around 17 or 18, and that&rsquo;s about the same age that whites enter the Armed Forces.  So the symmetry works out just about right   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just that black boys mature faster, pure blacks faster than mixed American blacks, and they faster than whites.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I find it incredible that I am the only African student in the entire politics department.&#8221; </p>
<p>Emma Thompson&rsquo;s adopted African lad went to a University in a city that is 98 percent white. What was he expecting? If a white man went to a provincial Chinese university off the beaten path, he would not be shocked to be one of the few whites in the University. </p>
<p>&#8220;He described two incidents of racist abuse, one by a group of &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; and another by &ldquo;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers&rdquo; outside a nightclub.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the nerds were mocking Tindy for his lack of scholastic ability. I remember at my University all the minorities, save Asians, were held to lower standards than the white students. Their writing was often garbled and hardly constituted acceptable college work. </p>
<p>As for the nightclub incident, we are only hearing one side of the story. The bouncers may have simply been doing their jobs when they forced the poor African out of the club. </p>

		<p>Emma Thompson&rsquo;s adopted black son is an example of the child as a fashion accessory. She shows that she is marvelously accepting of other races, and so is superior to other whites, less enlightened than she is.</p>

		<p>Emma Thompson is this year&rsquo;s poster girl for the malaise afflicting millions of Brits and other Europeans. She and Hugh Grant both did an outstanding job in Sense and Sensibility, one of the outstanding examples of British literature (whatever one may think of the social mores of the times). Then by her actions in Exeter she actively undertakes to undermine and destroy the very culture she so professionally conveyed in the film.</p>
<p>She is a prime example of the unappreciative, ungrateful liberal mindset that is destroying Western culture.</p>

<p><br>
All I see here is a trail of white enablers, attempting to change the course of history by plucking a black out of Africa and placing him on a pedastal above whites. </p>
<p>Why should Ms. Thompson and others like her be permitted unfettered leave to undermine white civilization?  </p>
<p>Every proud white has a moral duty to resist the Emma Thompsons of the world.<br>

		<p>There is little that I can do about Devon or Cornwall, nor do I care to do anything about them or their whiteness. What I can do though is to exercise my, still free, choice - to boycott Emma Thompson&rsquo;s movies - or any other work that features her. The one thing that I can do that makes her numbskull crusades possible is to deny her the ammunition (i.e. money) that enables her to conduct them.</p>

		<p>Well this speech certainly went down better than Miss Thompsons now infamous and controversial &#8216;What can we do to change the Blackness of Kigali?&rsquo; speech delivered in Rwandan&rsquo;s capital last year. </p>
<p>By definition, a majority White area in England must be full of those nasty right-wing pro Whites?<br>
I thought it was usually us downtrodden Whites who get to experience &#8216;the joys of diversity&rsquo; first who are normally those who participate in White preservation groups.<br>
 <br>
Not the guiltily rich, who acquire African&rsquo;s to parade around as a insurance policy and a visual defense against their own privileged backgrounds and lives.</p>
<p>It seems that all you have to do to be a &#8216;diversity crusader&rsquo; is find a majority White area, get up on your little soapbox with a megaphone and scream that all the inhabitants are evil bigots for being the same as they have always been.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it the locals choice after all?</p>
<p>Just because Miss Thompson&rsquo;s &#8216;feel good pet project&rsquo;, was a little uncomfortable out of his natural environment, everything has to change to suit him?<br>
(But they were there first and they are still currently the majority in their indigenous country?)</p>
<p>This Rwanda born person, has already had the opportunity of a lifetime thrust upon him, why must they smash the vehicle of that opportunity? Seems this is often the payback that these diversity pioneers deliver to their benefactors.</p>
<p>But as we know here at Amren, defending the &#8216;racism charge&rsquo; without making actual concessions would just make this institution guilty in the eyes of those who are now watching.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already lost the argument before saying a single word.<br>
In the same way we&rsquo;re losing the war without a single shot being fired.</p>

		<p>Before continuing her campaign to displace native Britons, Emma Thompson might want to visit the jungles of Rwanda, the ancestral homeland of little Tindyebwa.  If she escapes unscathed from the heart of darkness (an unlikely scenario to be sure), she might reconsider her actions. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s disgusting. Unfortunately though, it&rsquo;s not enough to just call her that.  But, fortunately, it&rsquo;s all I can manage right now. </p>
<p>The whole &#8220;you can&rsquo;t be racist to Whites&#8221; is a real howler. <br>
It shows you how insane they are.  The reason for their insanity? <br>
At no point does the language they use to communicate their most cherished beliefs ever make contact with reality.  We can see it, but they can&rsquo;t. But you know who can see it the most?<br>
The group I refer to as &#8220;Exposed Whites.&#8221;  That is, the Whites who have had, and continue to have, constant contact with hostile &#8220;minorities.&#8221; This group of Whites is usually poor.<br>
And now we get to the insanity of Multi-Culti Whites.</p>
<p>They say that non-Whites can&rsquo;t be racist because racism is about power.  But poor Whites have the least amount, no, today, poor Whites have NO political power at all! <br>
That is why they are the unofficial (should be Official) scapegoat of the Human Race today. They have NO power and LOTS of first hand experience with hostile non-Whites who are encouraged to take out their rage on what is essentially an imaginary enemy. Do you see what I mean about their beliefs not making contact with reality? And yet those beliefs are called absolute truths!  While the very real experience of poor Whites with NO power is ignored or ridiculed and distorted, and the slanderous misrepresentation is used as more &#8220;evidence&#8221; that we are dealing with a group of no good irredeemables who deserve all the violence they suffer from at the hands of non-Whites who are egged on by creeps, freaks, and charlatans like her! <br>

		<p>When you read the daily unending onslaught of hate directed at white people worldwide is there any question that, if given the chance, traitors like this woman or her non white compatriots wouldn&rsquo;t like to exterminate us all?  This type of thinking, right out in the open, should be a warning to white people worldwide.

		<p>For the person who asked about a 2.1, it&rsquo;s a mediocre grade. <br>
He&rsquo;s a &#8220;c&#8221; student.</p>
<p>The statement, &ldquo;I find it incredible that I am the only African student in the entire politics department.&rdquo;  demonstrates these adult-children&rsquo;s amazing lack of critical thinking skills.  It&rsquo;s because most blacks don&rsquo;t care to get an education.  Actually, they don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Everything is provided for blacks by the government so work or study really isn&rsquo;t necessary. As a race, they embrace this lifestyle and belief system. Like the inner cities in the U.S., the concept of a work ethic is dead.  There is no personal responsibility required for &#8220;minorities&#8221;, and if they feel the urge, they can basically get a job just by showing up and demanding one. That also goes for admission to any college or university. After all, they will have a liberal white, which is to say, &#8220;mindless&#8221; person, show up and blame all consequences on whites.  </p>
<p>Stay dumb, get paid.  Too bad liberals can&rsquo;t connect these dots when they&rsquo;re pandering to blacks.      </p>

		<p>I grew up in Cornwall, and my mother lived in Exeter until recently.  They are beautiful parts of the country, full of their own unique history and culture.  How dare this pretentious, worthless harridan ask &#8220;what can we do to change its Whiteness?&#8221;  How dare she?  These people have a mental ilness.  A couple of years ago, a town in England was described as &#8220;too White and too British&#8221;, by a government minister.  Why are they so keen to import the third world to Britain?  No one asked for it, and the only people that want it are oxygen thieves like Thompson. Go to Africa and ask &#8220;what can we do to change the Blackness of Kigali&#8221;. you worthless trollop.   </p>

		<p>A lot of British people go to Exeter Uni precisely because it is one of the few unis which still has a very indigenous student body.<br>
Amusing he went SOAS for his masters, no white should ever go there. Well known for its alien student body and marxoid politics.</p>

		<p>Anonymous at No. 1. In Britain a 2.1 degree is a v.good pass that about 45% of students get. In this category (2nds) the award can be nudged up if some of the work is worthy or lowered if much work is garbage.  A &#8216;First&rsquo; is the top degree, then Seconds 2.1 &amp; 2.2, a Third (loser pass) Ordinary (big loser pass)and finally Fail (What were u doing at University?).  99% of students take an Honours degree, a pass in which would be designated as 2.1(Hons). Perhaps they forgot to add this to the article. You need a minimum 2.1 to go to grad school.  Hope this helps.<br>
Re the articles:<br>
It seems to me that people like this vile woman Thompson are like so many of her compatriots setting out to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.  Make all of Britain Multicult and see how many golden eggs you get then madam.<br>

		<p>What do Emma Thompson and Stephen Fry care about whether sections of England are White or not?  More importantly, they get to look like enlightened progressives, lording over the stupid proletariat that pays their salaries, and rail against barbarians in front of their lefty, global elitist friends.  </p>
<p>They prove their &#8216;cred&rsquo; to the global elite by adopting african children and then demand Native Whites in the US and Europe change their culture for them.  </p>
<p>All of this is pontificated, as always, by those who hold themselves separate from having to live with what they demand of the rest of us.  That is why I strongly believe anyone who mandates government housing be built in a neighborhood not his own, or demands that your children attend schools that are economically and/or racially diverse must be forced to live in those areas, without the barricades and armed guards they are used to, and send their own precious children to such institutions. </p>
<p>Someone needs to ask Ms. Thompson and Mr. Fry point blank if they believe killing and mutilating Whites in SA is OK.  If they says &#8216;It&rsquo;s not the Whites&rsquo; country&rsquo;, then one could point out that England is not Tindy&rsquo;s native country and did they not expect there to be racial animus from British natives who are watching as their country and culture are destroyed by the likes of them and others of their ilk?  Why is it un-natural, evil and racist for natives Britons to protect what their ancestors have created and built over the past 10 centuries? </p>
<p>Violent backlash is natural and warranted.</p>
<p>Thompson, Fry et. al., hypocritically pontificate about wrecking British culture and displacing native Britons, those who have provided them with a comfortable life, and turning Britain over to non-Whites.</p>
<p>If that is not evil, I do not know what is.</p>

		<p>Notice where these liberal lovers of multiracial culture live - not very near where a lot of the immigrants they champion reside. They may adopt and African child but do they want to live near many Africans? No, that&rsquo;s for the less economically fortunate who have no choice thanks to the Labour sellout politicians who force on them the diversity the elite can avoid.  </p>

		<p>I live in the multicultural, multiracial utopia which is east London.  As it happens, my daughter attended Exeter University, and I visited the place a few times while she was there.  I have to come clean here - at the risk of branding myself an incorrigible racist, I must confess that on balance I prefer Exeter to east London.  Possibly something to do with feeling that I could walk down the street after dark without needing some sort of weapon in my pocket!<br>
I don&rsquo;t know which part of London Ms Thompson lives in, but I&rsquo;m willing to place a small wager that it&rsquo;s not Hackney, or Wembley, or Brixton.</p>

		<p> <i>He described two incidents of racist abuse, one by a group of &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; and another by &ldquo;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers&rdquo; outside a nightclub.</i></p>
<p><br>
Only two?  In all, he had two experiences of &#8220;racist abuse&#8221;  (not further described, whatever they were), and I suspect neither one was necessarily racial, since we know that hyper-sensitive blacks can take the slightest look or comment as &#8220;racist&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve gotten hostile &#8220;vibes&#8221; and &#8220;attitudes&#8221; from tattooed toughs too. I didn&rsquo;t take it as racism. It was just nastiness from nasty people.</p>
<p>Her Tindy should count himself lucky, though.  I am white and have experienced MANY racist incidents, more than I could even count&hellip; far more than just a mere two.  Oh, but that&rsquo;s alright! The article explicitly states that, <i>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t be racist to a white person&#8221;. </i> Well, that&rsquo;s comforting to know!  Thanks a lot. I feel much better now.</p>

		<p>Marxist reinvention in the guise of Multiculturalism and its weapon of repression, Political Correctness requires that modern day celebrities so-called, <b>actively</b> promote <i>Diversity</i> - <b>not</b> white, but non-white, <i>actively</i> being the operative term.</p>
<p>White celebrities who are prepared to betray their own racial brethren and homelands just to further their careers and line their bank accounts at the very least, I believe, should be boycotted for their treachery. Preferably, they should be tried for hate crime, imprisoned then expelled from out of every white homeland and their assets stripped off them.</p>

<p> You just partially answered a question I was getting ready to ask.  Just what part of London do celebrities such as Ms. Thompson  (in real life actually Mrs. Wise) prefer to live in?   Curious Americans such as I would like to know.   </p>
<p> Surely, just as the money and fame crowd in multiculty Los Angeles and New York prefer to cluster together in their secure little ghettos of wealth, away from the annoying diversity that they tout to the rest of us, I suppose it must be the same story in London as well.  No?  And all the more so lately, as the white population there wanes and leaves not much left that&rsquo;s still inhabitable for a white person.   Am I right, Joe?</p>

I have noticed that   &mdash;   particularly so with the British (not that America hasn&rsquo;t produced plenty of examples too). Such noted British actresses as Julie Cristie,  Glenda Jackson, Emma Thompson have all been closely associated wih the extreme Left. Some have made careers in it.  I wonder why that is?  Is this the price of having one&rsquo;s moment of fame in the limelight?  Is this requirement the political equivalent of the old casting couch?   </p>
<p>And I must note too, that (there, just as here) these flaming lefties also tend to be women particularly.  Interesting.</p>

A little internet research has revealed that Ms Thompson lives in&hellip; surprise, surprise&hellip; the area of London called Hampstead, where property prices start at about $1m.  I shouldn&rsquo;t think that, on her stroll down to her local bistro in the evening, she  encounters too many young men with their underwear on display.<br>
Apparently, she and her lovely family also own a second home in an area of Scotland known for its beauty, but not, amazingly, for its cultural diversity.<br>
Who would&rsquo;ve guessed?<br>
