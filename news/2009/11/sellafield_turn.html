<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/8341438.stm">Sellafield Turns Away BNP Leader</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, November 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin has been refused permission to visit the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria on security grounds.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said he wanted to visit the site, which sits within his North West European Parliament constituency, because he is pro-nuclear power.</p>
<p>But Sellafield Limited, which operates the site, said it was concerned about security and possible demonstrations.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said the decision prevented him from doing his job as an MEP.</p>
<p>The BNP leader sits on the European Parliament&rsquo;s environment committee and in that capacity asked to visit Sellafield.</p>
<p>But the nuclear plant refused, claiming it could cause &#8220;an unnecessary distraction&#8221; and be a safety risk.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Open and transparent&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Griffin said he wanted to tour Sellafield as part of his MEP duties and because he is against wind farms.</p>
<p>A statement from Sellafield Limited said: &#8220;He has expressed an interest in various aspects of the site&rsquo;s operations. We have offered to meet Mr Griffin and his team off site to discuss this in full, in accordance with our policy of being open and transparent with all stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety is our number one value at Sellafield and we were concerned that an on site visit by Mr Griffin and his team could cause an unnecessary distraction, with the potential for this to have a detrimental effect on safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>A BNP spokesman hit out at the decision, saying that if on-site security could not cope with Mr Griffin&rsquo;s visit then Sellafield had &#8220;serious problems&#8221;.<br>

		<p>What nuclear power plant has such weak security that it can&rsquo;t withstand some sign-wielding protesters?  I recall shortly before the Y2K non-event, seeing a van from the power company at the shooting range.  The two security guys were test-firing six AR-15s.  I&rsquo;m not about to believe that nuke plants don&rsquo;t have even greater firepower than our local oil-fired generators.  </p>

		<p>Anyone else find it ironic that - for all the &#8220;violence&#8221; and &#8220;intimidation&#8221; that the New Left would have us believe oozes from the pores of anyone remotely affiliated with the BNP - the only &#8220;violence&#8221; and &#8220;intimidation&#8221; I see is coming from the BNP&rsquo;s foes?</p>

		<p>I bet if Muslims fresh off the boat, demanded a tour of this nuclear facility, Sellafield would give it to them with no questions asked whatsoever. Heck, they&rsquo;d even provide armed security for the Muslims.</p>
<p>Keep up the good fight, Nick! You&rsquo;re continually showing people how utterly base and hypocritical your rival pols are. It&rsquo;s got to make the average Briton sit up and take notice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;an on site visit by Mr Griffin and his team could cause an unnecessary distraction, with the potential for this to have a detrimental effect on safety&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet England keeps importing untold thousands of immigrants from all over the middle-east. Who I&rsquo;m sure, once there, qualify for positive action consideration from this very same power plant. </p>

		<p>When people of color weren&rsquo;t safe, they called out the national guard, and every child in school needed to learn about this shameful intolerance. When Nick Griffin or white nationalists aren&rsquo;t safe, the authorities use it as an excuse to further their anti-BNP and anti-white agenda. </p>

		<p>Mr Griffin said he wanted to tour Sellafield as part of his MEP duties and because he is against wind farms.</p>
<p>This is further proof that Nick Griffin is a man who views the world objectively. Using wind power to supply energy to a modern society is as stupid an idea as the belief that race doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>This is an extract from &#8216;Safety in Nuclear Power Plants&rsquo; from the &#8216;Workplace Safety Advice&rsquo; web page.</p>
<p>&#8220;The responsibility for nuclear power plant security lies with the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). They are not just responsible for ensuring that each plant fully complies with security legislation within the confines of the plant but also for the transportation of any radioactive materials. Each plant, therefore, must have an approved security plan in addition to any safety legislation it must also adhere to. Access to nuclear power plants is strictly regulated with armed police, who are part of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, present at all of the UK&rsquo;s nuclear installations. They are responsible for the protection of all nuclear materials both contained within the site and whilst in transit. One of the main reasons why potential terrorists have not targeted nuclear reactors, apart from the fact that they are so robust in the way they are designed these days, is that any damage caused as a result of terrorist activity would not result in any significant release of radioactivity which could not be contained within the plant itself. In fact, thorough scientific research has shown that the reality of a major disaster occurring as a result of a terrorist attack would be far less than a similar attack on, say, a coal fired power station&#8221;.</p>
<p>The crowd forming the recent &#8216;protest camp&rsquo; outside a coal fired power station in Kent was outnumbered by the Police in attendance. Previous protests included scaling a large smoke-stack and chaining humans to a coal conveyor belt fuel feed. Both facilities had to be shut down to prevent harm to the protestors who did not go home and disconnect their own domestic electricity supply as a genuine protest. No terrorists were identified but, no doubt, they watched the police response with great interest as such protests offer an excellent cover for an actual attack. Sellafield could simply have organised a visit by Nick Griffin and a handful of others without making any fuss and no one would have been any the wiser. There must be hundreds of official visits every year and we never know about them because there is no real public interest. I bet there will be lots of requests in the near future, just to &#8216;test the water&rsquo; so to speak. Speaking of water, Sellafield was originally named &#8216;Windscale&rsquo; until someone inside the plant dumped plutonium rods down a water well and polluted the Irish Sea! The BNP were not visiting at the time!</p>

		<p>Sellafield has admitted several Sien-Fein *ex*-terrorists in recent times and the MET Police (London) has appointed and is paying a Tunisian terrorist for *advice*. Mr Mohamed Ali Harrath despite being the subject of an Interpol red notice (its highest state of alert) since 1992 because of terrorist activities in Tunisia, where he helped found the Tunisian Islamic Front (FIT). </p>
<p>So that being the case who is the real security threat here and who decides this arbitrary measure? Clearly there is a reality dis-connect here.</p>
<p>Two incidents have occurred today in UK Courts where Nick Griffin and a BNP party activist (who was attacked in a racially motivated incident by a black UAF member with a claw hammer) have had their cases thrown out by judges despite video evidence and witnesses.</p>
<p>Link from the BNP website: https://bnp.org.uk/2009/11/one-law-for-british-people-another-law-for-the-colonisers/</p>
<p>Also with reference to Nick Griffin&rsquo;s appearance on the almost &#8220;institutional&#8221; BBC Question Time, the &#8220;outrage&#8221; in the BBC and liberal circles has been wonderfully captured in this vid from u-tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRJ45QhvOos" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRJ45QhvOos</a> (funny)</p>
<p>- Many thanks to those Americans for supporting the BNP. </p>

<p> One Law for British People, another Law for the Colonisers<br>
 BNP Filed under National News</p>
<p>Three events this past week all prove that there is one law for British people and another for the Third World colonisers of this country, said Nick Griffin MEP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past seven days we have seen the acquittal of a Muslim who racially abused me in public. Earlier, all charges were withdrawn against the black UAF thug who attacked Liverpool BNP activist Tony Ward with a claw hammer, and then I was refused entry into Sellafield power station,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By themselves, any one of the incidents would have been disgraceful. But taken together, they show that there is a concerted ganging-up against the British people by the liberal establishment,&rdquo; the BNP leader said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are numerous cases where indigenous British people have been sent to jail based on no other evidence than what a single Third Worlder has said,&rdquo; Mr Griffin continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case of Kevin Hughes, for example, who was imprisoned purely on the word of an asylum seeker with no other witnesses, springs to mind. Yet when a Muslim man abuses me personally in front of witnesses, he is discharged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The double standards are blatant. An indigenous white person&rsquo;s word is worth less than a Third World immigrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin asked what would happen to a BNP member who was filmed attacking a black person with a claw hammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine if a BNP member, in full public view and while being filmed, struck a black person in the face with a claw hammer and nearly killed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think the courts would say about that? Would the BNP man even stand a chance of not being, correctly I might add, jailed for a very long time for such a serious offence, especially if the assault was captured on film?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet this past week we have seen all charges withdrawn against a black member of the David Cameron-supported UAF who struck Tony Ward with a claw hammer in the face,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That case makes even my own court appearance with the Muslim gentleman seem sane. There is obviously one set of standards applied to indigenous British people and another to Third World immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision to withdraw charges against the UAF thug is nothing less than an incitement to commit violence against indigenous British people. In effect, it says to Third World immigrants that they will not be prosecuted if they attack British people in public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin also pointed out the double standards in the decision to bar him access to the Sellafield power station grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take, for example, the case of Mr Mohamed Ali Harrath,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This man is paid by the taxpayers after being appointed as an advisor to the Metropolitan Police despite being the subject of an Interpol red notice (its highest state of alert) since 1992 because of terrorist activities in Tunisia, where he helped found the Tunisian Islamic Front (FIT).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So a Tunisian Islamist extremist on the run from other countries can serve as an advisor to the police, yet I am not allowed into Sellafield for so-called security issues,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said, adding that even Sinn Fein delegates known to have served in the IRA have been allowed to visit Sellafield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The indigenous British people must understand that a deadly war is being waged against them by the establishment Labour/Tory/Lib-Dem alliance. They will not stop until all indigenous British people are exterminated.</p>
