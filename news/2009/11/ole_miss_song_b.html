			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patsy Brumfield, Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Continued chants &#8220;The South Shall Rise Again&#8221; today cost Ole Miss fans a favorite game tune, &#8220;From Dixie With Love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chancellor Dan Jones banned the playing of the pep song medley because fans refused to stop the chant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The song is a blend of &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; &#8220;All My Trials&#8221; and the &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; written by an assistant band director in the mid-1970s apparently as a way to get away from just &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; which had become offensive to many peoploe [sic] in the post Civil Rights era.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see them try and enforce it.  I can just see ushers and security staff trying to eject tens of thousands of people from a football stadium.  You could enforce a ban on the Confederate flag, because the security guards can check people at the gates.  But they can&rsquo;t read your mind to see if you&rsquo;re going to sing a song.</p>

		<p> I started school in south Georgia in 1958 . Through most of grammar school we would start each day by singing Dixie and the Battle Hymn of the Republic . I always liked both songs . I realize now the controversial allegations against both songs . I still like both songs . We did not burn our draft cards either during Vietnam . And when I went in the service in 1971, many non-southerners were keenly aware of that fact . What most offends me is the political correctness that is consuming my country and our inability to fight back .</p>

		<p>My family and I were at the Arizona State Game in Oxford.  No one could hear the student section singing anything, except &#8220;Hoddy Toddy.&#8221;  No one else was singing around us, either.  To me this is the third strike.  First, the honourable Confederate Battle Flag.  Second, Colonel Rebel.  Third, From Dixie with Love.  I disposed of every piece of Ole Miss property that I owned today.  I will longer purchase UM property nor go to their games.  Many people throughout Dixie have had enough.  Deo Vindice<br>

		<p>I find &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; to be offensive, and refuse to sing this sanctimonious song which glorifies the destruction of the South.</p>

		<p>There was a running front page story in our city about a Midwest alumni who was taking a cab ride from the airport  to watch his team play in a bowl game here. Just as he was pulling into the parking lot he suffered a massive heart attack. The cabbie sped out of the stadium and raced to the nearest Emergency Room, running redlights and jumping traffic medians on the way. He then called the mans wife, met her at the airport later that night and got her checked in to a hotel. He spent the next five days shuttling her back and forth to the hospital and finally sent them both back to the airport. <br>
  In gratitude and against the cabbie`s protests, the man bought the driver  his own limousine company to the tune of about $500,000. My point is this. That kind of respect and loyalty should be matched by anger and indignation at changing hallowed traditions to placate people who don`t attend and probably don`t care a whit anyway. I`d be interested in hearing how many million dollar donations are given to someone or something more deserving than this administrator and his University.</p>

		<p>     The South will rise again. You can count on it. While the rest of white America does a death dance to the tune of Mexican guitars, the South has stayed strong. They alone will survive. They are united by culture; have their own religion, own sport and own music.The South will rise and I hope that they will allow me and mine to come along.</p>

		<p>My family and forebearers came from Poland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia some 30 years after the end of the Civil War and settled in the northeastern and midwestern US. Therefore, it would seem that I have no dog in this fight.</p>
<p>Even so, this concerns me because every time we give the PC Posse an inch, they take a yard. Take, for example, their treatment of Columbus. </p>
<p>At the same time, as I&rsquo;ve said time and time again, this whole thing is a decoy, a straw dummy, a red herring. If there is any culture that keeps blacks down, it&rsquo;s not Southern culture, but ghetto street thug culture that glorifies spawning illegitmate kids and conspicuous consumption. Furthermore, for the first time in 150 years, serious talk about secession is in the air. But instead of focusing on these serious issues, we should ban a college fight song or a flag.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. </p>

		<p>When I was a youngster in Baton Rouge, one of the local TV stations used to sign off with Elvis performing &#8220;An American Trilogy,&#8221; which is essentially the same song as &#8220;From Dixie With Love.&#8221; </p>
<p>Those were the good ole&rsquo; days. (Now it&rsquo;s not an issue, because TV stations don&rsquo;t &#8220;sign off&#8221; anymore!)</p>

		<p>It offends Blacks? I say, let them be offended!</p>
<p>I mean, do Black rappers think about not offending Whites when they record rap «songs» with heinous lyrics (towards Whites)?</p>

		<p>The systematic destruction of Ole Miss&rsquo; Southern heritage by the Administration is a disgrace.  When I was a student at Ole Miss a few years ago, the Student Body Association held a non-binding vote on whether to keep Colonel Reb as the mascot.  In a campus-wide vote, students voted 95%+ in favor of Colonel Reb.  </p>
<p>This latest move is the last straw for me; I have resigned from every alumni organization I belonged to and refuse to support the University in any way.  I would be interested in how the student body is reacting.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there are massive displays against the Chancellor at the next game and defiant chants of &#8220;the South will rise again&#8221;, song or no song.  Most posters at AmRen have no idea how right-wing the student body at Ole Miss is.  Almost every dorm room and frat house room has a Confederate Flag on the wall and blacks aren&rsquo;t even allowed to step foot in most frat houses unless they are on the staff.</p>
