<h1>Search Warrant: Suspect Admitted Taking NC Girl</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>San Francisco Chronicle, November 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man already accused of kidnapping a 5-year-old North Carolina girl faces new charges that he raped and asphyxiated her, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>Mario McNeill is being charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape of a child, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old McNeill was charged earlier this week with kidnapping, with authorities saying he took Shaniya Davis from her Fayetteville home. Her body was found Monday in thick underbrush off a rural North Carolina road after searchers spent nearly a week looking for her.</p>
<p>Bergamine gave few further details of the investigation Thursday. Earlier in the week, authorities said McNeill admitted taking the girl, but the chief did not say whether McNeill admitted to the child&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>A search warrant says McNeill picked the girl up in front of the home and drove her to a hotel where she was last seen alive. Surveillance video captured McNeil carrying the girl in the building.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police issued the warrant containing the new charges against McNeill after they collected hair and fibers, clothes, and a straw from his 1997 Mitsubishi Galant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>As tragic as this is one can&rsquo;t help notice the interracial aspect. An unmarried white father and black mother. Black mother &#8220;sells&#8221; the daughter to a black pedophile who rapes and murders her. There is really only one victim in this - the little girl. Everyone else is guilty. Although one might argue that the white father is a victim. A victim of his own stupidity. When will these people learn?</p>

		<p>In San Francisco in 1984, a 10 year old boy, Kevin was kidnapped off of the street at Oak and Masonic. The incident got a lot of publicity in San Francisco for a long time. About 20 years later, I saw something on the news about a black who allegedly kidnapped him, and took him to Wisconsin,I think, raped him, and killed him.The rapist has since died .  </p>

<p>&#8220;Although one might argue that the white father is a victim. A victim of his own stupidity&#8221;</p>
<p>Im going to go on the assumption that the courts probably gave custody to the mother, due to the fact that along with the maternal thing, they felt the child was better off with the parent of the like color. No doubt.<br>

		<p>So where are Al Sharpton and Jesse now?  They ONLY show up when anyone lies about rape or shouts &#8220;N word&#8221; but do they not care about this killing? OR Jashon Williams an AA toddler who was drowned and sold out by his mother to a repeat convicted Black child killer OR the black woman who tortured her son to death recently? Or the white gang rape victim in Richmond? </p>

		<p>Unfortunately the maternal thing was not the case. The father had custody and let her live with the mother for a total of five weeks in her life. He was interviewed with a white woman at his side but I do not know what his relationship with her might be. One of the child&rsquo;s aunts checked on here more frequently than the father did and it may have been the aunt standing beside the father.</p>

		<p>   The great hoaxer (rev.al)will not be heard or seen. He specializes in phony charges against white men. Then he riles up the loathsome press. Next thing you have is tawanna brawley or the jena six hoxes. That&rsquo;s just the rev. al doin&rsquo; his thing. He won&rsquo;t partake in this incident. There&rsquo;s no white angle to get the phony press hopped up on.</p>

		<p>According to earlier reports, the child has been in her father&rsquo;s custody for the last three years.  He agreed to share custody with her mother after she &#8220;turned her life around&#8221;, got a job and held it for six (6) months!  Within a month, the child was dead.</p>
<p>The good Rev is not interested in this case - there are no white villains here.</p>
