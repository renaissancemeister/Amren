			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, November 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new leader of the nation&rsquo;s largest Latino legal advocacy organization says immigrants&rsquo; rights forces should focus on modest gains  &mdash;  such as the right to an education for the undocumented, and the right of lesbians and gays to sponsor partners as immigrants  &mdash;  if Congress doesn&rsquo;t overhaul the immigration system by early 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&rsquo;ve waited long enough. It&rsquo;s time for some down payments,&#8221; Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in an interview during a visit to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Saenz took the job in August after the Obama administration, under pressure from conservatives who saw him as too friendly to undocumented immigrants, withdrew an offer to nominate him as head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division.</p>
<p>He said MALDEF&rsquo;s top priority is still comprehensive immigration legislation that would offer a path to legalization, with a waiting period and minimal fines or penalties, to the millions of &#8220;undocumented immigrants who have been contributing to society.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Debate &#8216;coarsened&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But Saenz said he is not optimistic about passage of such a measure in an election year.</p>
<p>The immigration debate &#8220;has been coarsened,&#8221; and President Obama is apparently trying to avoid controversy, Saenz said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be a perception that (immigration) is somehow the third rail of politics,&#8221; Saenz said. He said immigrants&rsquo; rights supporters have de-emphasized some lesser measures while concentrating on their main goal, and might be wise to refocus on those measures in the coming year.</p>
<p><b>Others want to fight</b></p>
<p>Not all advocates agree.</p>
<p>&#8220;The environment, the way we&rsquo;ve seen it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. makes us increasingly confident that we&rsquo;re going to see comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. The Obama administration, he said, has &#8220;underestimated political support for immigrants,&#8221; as shown in the health bill that the House approved Nov. 7.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measures that Saenz wants MALDEF and its allies to promote in 2010 would:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Allow children who entered the United States illegally, and later graduated from high school, to earn legal residence by obtaining a college degree or serving in the armed forces.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Allow undocumented farm workers to qualify for legal residence with five to seven years of agricultural employment.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Allow lesbians and gays to sponsor their partners for immigration as family members, just as other U.S. citizens and legal residents can now sponsor their spouses or close relatives.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Prohibit state and local governments from passing immigration laws that are more restrictive than federal law, such as an Arizona statute requiring employers to verify their workers&rsquo; immigration status. That law is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p><b>Backs sanctuary laws</b></p>
<p>&#8220;We should have one uniform nationwide policy (on immigration penalties),&#8221; Saenz said. He said cities such as San Francisco should be free to establish more generous policies through sanctuary laws that discourage authorities from reporting suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Conservative backlash</b></p>
<p>Attorney General-designate Eric Holder offered him the Civil Rights Division job in January, but told him two months later that the administration had decided not to nominate him, Saenz said.</p>
<p>Some anti-immigration groups labeled Saenz an extremist and an &#8220;open-borders advocate.&#8221; But Saenz said the focus of the backlash, which followed Justice Department leaks of the prospective appointment, was his MALDEF work, particularly the Prop. 187 suit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the Obama administration has taken some courageous stands on other issues, Saenz said, in his case, &#8220;I wish they had shown more backbone.&#8221;<br>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke if the US went to war with Mexico, and after cleaning it out from border to border, we installed  one of our generals as temporary head of the government and encouraged American citizens to buy up cheap land there by the thousands of acres for white housing, enticing the migration of tens of millions of whites who insisted on changing the customs and language to American?</p>
<p>Eventually, maybe we could entice tens of millions of whites to </p>

		<p>Now that the mania about man-made global warming has been exposed as a lie, and that I think that &#8220;global warming,&#8221; or at least the brouhaha over it, was nothing more than a front for big corporations to convince white (and other) Americans to reduce their standard of living, and therefore accept lower pay and wages, I predict that the establishment, still wanting cheap labor, will be pushing immigration amnesty and open borders, and pushing it hard.  Be ready for an onslaught like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>

		<p>Why do we have to give our country away?  If you look at the land mass of the America&rsquo;s the vast majority is inhabited by Hispanics.  They already have more territory than they will ever need.  Lands with a variety of natural resources, geography and climates.  So why are we allowing them to take us over?  Because they have done such a good job with what they all ready have?  The Hispanic conquest of the US will go down in history as the only invasion and genocide of a peoples that was encouraged by, paid for by and not resisted by the victims themsleves.</p>

<p>This is our country.  Our sandbox, our rules.  We should be able to accept or reject whomever we want, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Foreigners do not have the fundamental right to immigrate here, just as a visitor does not have the fundamental right to enter my home  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t have to let them in. </p>

		<p>What they had they never did anything with, least wise anything outstanding or note worthy.</p>
<p>They are doing more at this time, like sucking the life out of our Country.  They cost more than they pay or put back in, it is a zero sum game.</p>
<p>As with most minorities they only have what the &#8220;man&#8221; has given away, not earned.  The earners are few and far between.</p>
<p>How come the minorities always clamouring for more give aways can&rsquo;t create and build on their own?  How come everything has to be a gift?  They can&rsquo;t build anything except chaos, which means endless disorder and confusion.  </p>

		<p>The Obama people know a killer issue when they see one, and giving illegals a free ride is a sure way to guarantee they lose in 2010 and 2012.  For once I&rsquo;m glad - what is needed is to send the illegals home, give their jobs to legal Americans, and send any Hispanics who don&rsquo;t like it straight back to where they originally came from.  We have enough problems with the economy and the dollar tanking; we don&rsquo;t need to have to be dealing with a bunch of whining illegal Mexicans.</p>

		<p>Why are people in these immigrant &#8220;rights&#8221; groups who keep promoting the Hispanic invasion and take over of the United States not charged with &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; the violation of the immigration laws of this country? Furthmore, since they are assisting millions of foreigners, particularly Mexicans, to cross our borders, maintain their Spanish language and culture, and fly the Mexican flag which in a sane world would be seen as the invasion it is, why are they not also charged with treason?</p>
