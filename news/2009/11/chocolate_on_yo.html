			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Fernandez, Daily Mail (London), November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The parents of a six-year-old girl are outraged after their daughter was branded a racist for telling a black girl she had chocolate on her face.</p>
<p>They fear the incident could &#8216;haunt&rsquo; her throughout her time at school.</p>
<p>Sharona Gower had been eating chocolate mousse and was playing with a friend when she was chased by two 11-year-old girls.</p>
<p>When one of the older girls, who was black, said Sharona had chocolate on her face, the youngster replied: &#8216;Well, you&rsquo;ve got chocolate on yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The older girl wiped her face and said: &#8216;I&rsquo;ve got nothing on my face, actually.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl then complained to a teacher, who gave Sharona a telling off.</p>
<p>But when Michelle Gower, 34, went to collect her daughter from school, she was told the incident was &#8216;racist&rsquo; and that a complaint had been logged.</p>
<p>Now Mrs Gower and her husband Nick, 45, believe the incident at St Paul&rsquo;s School, in Rusthall, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was not properly investigated and has left their daughter &#8216;distressed and confused&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mrs Gower said: &#8216;The teacher told me that the girl had complained that Sharona was racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;The teacher said she had to record this and it had been logged as required by law.</p>
<p>&#8216;The teacher said they have a zero-tolerance policy for racism and bullying, which my husband and I totally agree with.</p>
<p>&#8216;She also said she did not know whether the other girl had chocolate on her face or not, her words were she may have done, but she did not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the school said the incident had been blown out of proportion</p>
<p>Mr Gower, a dealer in antique collectibles, said: &#8216;It was a bit of playground banter that has been taken as a sinister racial remark.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is a six-year-old who hasn&rsquo;t got an idea what racism is and has been labelled as a racist.&rsquo; He added: &#8216;This is political correctness gone absolutely crazy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gower, who lives in Rusthall, said the teacher did not explain what &#8216;logging&rsquo; the incident meant.</p>
<p>She and her husband now fear the information may be kept on the school&rsquo;s database and haunt their daughter for the rest of her school career.</p>
<p>Mrs Gower, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, at the school, said she complained to the school&rsquo;s head, Carolyn Cohen, who took the side of the older girls.</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;I told her Sharona is very upset and confused about this situation and didn&rsquo;t fully understand why she was being reprimanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Cohen last night denied that the incident had been logged on a computer database.</p>
<p>A spokesman for St Paul&rsquo;s school said in a statement: &#8216;This was a small incident, which has been blown out of all proportion. Children and parents were spoken to following an inappropriate comment.</p>
<p>&#8216;The matter was dealt with appropriately and the issue is closed.&rsquo;</p>

Well, if you &#8220;totally agree&#8221; with the policy, what&rsquo;s the problem?  Supporting a draconian minority-pandering policy means you hung your white child out to dry long before the &#8220;chocolate&#8221; comments started flying.  </p>

<p>Yes, and the thought police review those logs periodically to see who is to be prosecuted by the truth squad for possible incarceration in the re-education center for thought crimes against those regarded as privileged.</p>
<p>My God, How did they screw that country up so much and so quickly? </p>
<p>This entire situation of Western social engineering is a kind of madness contrived by fools who are out of touch with reality. <br>

		<p>11-year-olds usually have enough dignity not to run to the teacher and report what a 6-year-old said.  Or at least, that was how it was when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Oh wait, never mind, this is heresy we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

		<p>I jest, but really, there&rsquo;s nothing at all silly about this.  This is very much a typical example of the sort of racism non-whites endure at the hands of whites (if what I&rsquo;ve read about <i>A Conversation About Race</i> is correct).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to tell poor downtrodden souls like these; maybe they should all go far away from all us white folks, because clearly our bad goes right to the bone and can&rsquo;t be cured.  It&rsquo;s a good thing racism keeps us from moving to places like east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - at least <i>those</i> folks are safe from the vagaries of ineradicable white racism.  Oddly, you couldn&rsquo;t drag most of them away; I&rsquo;ve got it - racial masochism is the inevitable result of exposure to ineradicable white racism.  There, nice and circular the way &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; like it.  I should probably copyright that before they steal it.</p>

		<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;..there will be back pedaling, apologies to the blacks and the usual groveling and the 6 year old will change schools (if the parents are smart, which they probably are not) and an out of court settlement will be offered to the &#8220;outraged&#8221; blacks AS USUAL!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to get something straight here: it is the so-called victim and another 11-year-old girl who were giving a hard time to 6-year-old Sharona. But because young Miss Gower replied with words that had a racial connotation, in this case, she gets a reprimand and the Black girl who started the whole thing is off the hook? That seems pretty unfair to me!</p>

		<p>From the photo, it appears Michelle mated up with a pretty swarthy male to begin with&hellip; just not swarthy enough, I guess or it would be difficult for one black to accuse another of racist comments.</p>
<p>We have entered the labrynth of the racial twilight zone.  As the tangle expands, and purposes continue to cross one another, logic will be confounded and purpose obscured.  This is part of the final breakdown of society, and no one will inherit the earth.</p>

		<p>The 6 year old girl was chased by the 11 year old girlS. The 6 year old girl said something that 6 year olds are likely to say. </p>
<p>The 6 year old is now harassed by the school system.</p>
<p>The 11 year old girlS are forgiven for chasing the 6 year old girl because the 11 year old girlS have the skin color of privilege, while the 6 year old girl is White, and assumed to be racist from birth.<br>

		<p>England is beyond the tipping point, it can be written off, the remaining true English, if there are any, should migrate to Russia if they care about their descendants.</p>
<p>France, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands are write offs too like most of Western Europe.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see:</p>
<p>A single six-year-old was chased and bullied by TWO eleven-year-olds.  The tiny child repeated, REPEATED, the exact words used by one of the adolescents.</p>
<p>Two adolescents chasing and insulting a tiny child is definitely bullying.  It is possibly an &#8216;incident&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A first-grader&rsquo;s repeating the words of a fifth-grader&hellip;to that same fifth-grader, within moments of hearing the words, is NOT an &#8216;incident&rsquo;.</p>
<p>At least it wasn&rsquo;t, until England became a totalitarian monster every bit as bad as the Nazi and Stalinist dictatorships we were all taught to abhor.  This is what two generations of English, Australian, and American soldiers were sent through the meat-grinder for?  This is what our fathers fought for?  I think NOT!</p>

		<p>This is how the race game is played, on a small scale.  A White six year old is chased by a Black 11 year old, and the victim is accused of racism.  On a large scale, Blacks commit the overwhelming bulk of interracial crime, and a White Justice of the Peace in the American hinterland makes national news for declining to marry a White female to a Black male.  The logic is clear: Minor, non-violent slights towards Blacks outweigh Black murder and rape of Whites.  Dogs, quite literally, have more standing than Whites in the eyes of our Rulers.  Would Michael Vick have been so publicly reviled had he merely beaten and robbed some White guy instead of getting caught with fighting dogs?    </p>

<p>Well Sir, life is &#8220;unfair.&#8221; Now Sharona has jump on most other children her age. She&rsquo;s learned an early lesson in just how unfair life can be. and a cheap lesson at that.</p>

		<p>Blacks in Europe are offended that someone says they have chocoloate on their face, yet not a peep about whites in Africa getting their possession taken from them and getting killed.  So killing whites and displacing them is okay, but heaven forbid you merely try to help out a black person!  What horror.</p>

		<p>This girl may only be 11 but she has already honed her skill of playing the race card to a fine point. Fast forward 10 years, she&rsquo;ll get into a good college on lousy scores by screaming racism if she is not admitted, 20 years from now she&rsquo;ll have a good job by screaming racism and so on. Yes, this girl will go far on the race card. </p>

		<p>It amazes me the foresight that Mr. Orwell possessed. He saw the eventual and inevitable outcome of liberalism. He just missed the time scale and the delivery system. Someone should revise &#8216;1984&rsquo;. Backing up to tell the tale from WWII into the near future that will parallel the original story all so horrifyingly well. God save us.</p>

		<p>Blacks will take every opportunity to use tools like this zero tolerance law to brand as many and as much as possible as &#8220;racist&#8221;. This is standard racial power gaming thereby intimidating whites and gaining power - which is all predictable except by the stupid whites that allow it all to happen.</p>
