<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/nov/06/race-discrimination-teaching-profession-nasuwt">Institutional Racism Keeps Black Teachers out of Top Posts  &mdash;  Report Finds</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Shepherd, Guardian (Manchester), November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only a handful of black and ethnic minority teachers are made headteachers each year because of an &#8220;endemic culture of institutional racism&#8221; in England&rsquo;s schools, a study claimed today.</p>
<p>Researchers at Manchester University and analysts at Education Data Surveys quizzed 556 state school teachers from ethnic minorities for their report. They asked the teachers what had helped or prevented them from being promoted and whether they had faced discrimination.</p>
<p>Ethnic minorities make up 10.1% of the population of England but only 1% or fewer of the headteachers in primary and secondary schools, according to data gathered by the teaching unions.</p>
<p>Only 2.6% of teachers are Asian, while 1.7% are black and 0.8% are of mixed race, data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families from last year shows.</p>
<p>Some 44% of the teachers quizzed said they had suffered discrimination because of their ethnicity and 70% said it was harder for teachers from ethnic minorities to become headteachers than it was for white teachers.</p>
<p>The male teachers cited discrimination as the top barrier to them becoming a head, while for the female teachers this was the sixth biggest barrier. Women teachers cited workload, self confidence and family responisbiities as the most significant obstacles to them taking up a headship.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of African teachers said they had faced discrimination, compared with two-fifths of Pakistani teachers and a third of Indian and Caribbean teachers.</p>
<p>The study, The leadership aspirations and careers of black and minority ethnic teachers, which was commissioned by a training college for aspiring headteachers  &mdash;  the National College for Leadership of Schools and Children&rsquo;s Services  &mdash;  and teaching union Nasuwt, concludes that the findings are &#8220;indicative of an endemic culture of institutional racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Four-fifths of the teachers quizzed said they were &#8220;very&#8221; or &#8220;reasonably&#8221; ambitious.</p>
<p>The two main barriers to promotion were the perception that headteachers are overworked and a lack of confidence in their ability to take on a headteacher&rsquo;s role.</p>
<p>&#8220;When depicting teachers in leadership posts, black and minority ethnic role models should be used wherever possible, in order to create an image of an inclusive profession and to challenge the dominant cultural perceptions that black and minority ethnic teachers do not make good leaders,&#8221; one of the co-author&rsquo;s of the study, Professor Olwen McNamara, said.</p>
<p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the Nasuwt, said: &#8220;This report reveals the true extent of the problem of racism and discrimination that, regrettably, is still all too pervasive in our schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the government and local authorities should &#8220;systematically monitor&#8221; the career paths of BME teachers so that barriers could be identified and removed.</p>
<p>Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: &#8220;Black teachers have to apply many more times than white colleagues for higher positions. This experience leaves many lacking the confidence and support needed to move up the teaching career ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to know where this discrimination originates and to eradicate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others said the findings did not show schools were institutionally racist.</p>
<p>Steve Munby, chief executive of the National College, said: &#8220;While there is no doubt that some of those sampled had experienced discrimination, which is obviously unacceptable, this does not mean that the system is institutionally racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although discrimination on the grounds of race was cited by all as in the top ten barriers to achieving career aspirations, workload and confidence were the first and second most cited barriers overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Ward, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: &#8220;This research shows that the number one barrier to leadership for black and minority ethnic teachers is the same as for non-black and minority ethnic groups, and that is excessive workload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Discrimination should not be tolerated anywhere but, if anything, there is more equality and understanding in schools than in many other workplaces.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of the teachers polled were from secondary schools with just under a third from primary schools. The rest were from special and other schools. Just under three-quarters of the teachers were women. Two-thirds were of Indian, Afro-Caribbean, African or Pakistani origin. The mean age of teachers in the sample was 38.</p>
<p>A spokesman from the DCSF said: &#8220;We know there is more to do to break down the barriers stopping black and minority ethnic teachers from achieving their full potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why we are through the National College developing training programmes to support promising BME teachers develop leadership skills and encourage them into leadership roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Ofsted, we have set up a scheme for BME school leaders to shadow Ofsted inspectors to help boost confidence and increase aspiration to progress to headship. Given it takes around ten years for headteachers to come through, today&rsquo;s crop of heads started their careers in the mid-1990s when there was no support or career structure in place for teachers full stop.&#8221;<br>

		<p>So only 5% of UK teachers are from ethnic minorities but 1% are headteachers. That is 20%.</p>
<p>BTW I would think that a substantial proportion of the Asian teachers tech Islam or Community languages. I live in a part of London where &#8216;minority&rsquo; pupils make up approx 90% of pupils but I have never seen a minority teacher.</p>

<p>If I were a black teacher, I&rsquo;d keep my mouth shut about higher echelon jobs for fear it might be discovered that I&rsquo;m not even qualified to teach and wouldn&rsquo;t be doing so if it weren&rsquo;t for affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Let me guess - some British schools still have decent standards and want to keep them that way. This is, of course, standing in the way of black advancement. </p>
<p>How can this horrible problem be fixed? Maybe the way Ronnie fixed it for the US government by removing exams for civil servants. With no standards, soon Britan will have schools just like the US where the high school valedictorian(s) are comprised of 2/3 of the graduating class.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d bet anything that the minority teachers aren&rsquo;t as qualified as white teachers, which isn&rsquo;t all that different from here except our institutions are falling all over each other trying to prove how un-racist they are.  So U.S. institutions make a practice of hiring biased and unqualified teachers so they&rsquo;ll look good in the eyes of those who care about that sort of thing.  Britain doesn&rsquo;t have Affirmative Action   &mdash;   so if you get a minority teacher or doctor there, s/he just might be qualified, unlike what you find here in the States.  Just ask Michael Jackson&rsquo;s family&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Why do blacks come to predominately white countries and complain about how hard it is?  I mean, they weren&rsquo;t wanted in the first place, they immigrated to a nation MUCH better than where they came from in Africa, and have the rudeness and audacity to push their weight around.</p>

		<p>The figures will always be skewed showing signs of &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; because ethnic minorities, who make up 10% of the nation, make up a larger percentage of those under 20 years of age, and a smaller percentage of those middle aged and older, the age coincidently of a head teacher. This will always be the case. The UK will always be filled with &#8216;racism&rsquo; to report on until the last white there finally dies of old age. </p>

		<p>The complaint is entirely correct once you understand that &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; is just a code phrase for &#8220;having relevant standards&#8221;.  So, yes, institutional racism is still rampant in any institution that still works, and it&rsquo;s a good thing, too.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was talking to someone here in the United States who works in a University, and she said that a lot of the applications for employment that she sees have such poor spelling and grammar that that alone disqualifies them for employment. An educational system simply cannot risk hiring someone who will embarrass the school with his or her ignorance of basic spelling and grammar. I would love to see the resumes of some of these &#8220;victims of racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A teaching union is to campaign against the new code of conduct for teachers, which it says intrudes on their private lives. The code, which will come into force in October, states that teachers must &ldquo;demonstrate honesty and integrity and uphold public trust and confidence in the teaching profession&rdquo;. Teachers are also expected to &ldquo;maintain reasonable standards in their own behaviour&rdquo; or face disciplinary procedures, according to the General Teaching Council, the profession&rsquo;s watchdog, which drew up the code. The actions of teachers while off duty will now be under the spotlight  &mdash;  a move that the NASUWT, a teaching union, said set &ldquo;unreasonable expectations of how people should conduct themselves&rdquo;.  The teaching council has said that, for example, those who drink heavily and disgrace themselves face discipline for bringing the profession into disrepute, even if it is outside school hours and they have not broken the law. Chris Keates, chief executive of the NASUWT, said that there was a lot of anger among teachers about the revised code. The union is to ask members to protest against the code in the coming months. &ldquo;Teachers are entitled to a private life,&rdquo;  Keates said. &ldquo;It will lead to teachers being put in a position that no other workers are put in. Their conduct outside work is under a scrutiny that no one else&rsquo;s life would be under.&rdquo; The NASUWT is calling for the code to be abandoned because, it says, teachers are already subject to professional standards, capability and disciplinary measures for their conduct in school. The General Teaching Council said that the code &ldquo;sets out expectations of reasonable standards of behaviour but does not limit a teacher&rsquo;s right to a private life&rdquo;.</p>

		<p>This must be todays &#8216;the lunatics are running the asylum&rsquo; type of story from the UK.</p>
<p>From reading these stories regularly over time, I find I get a little less angry every time.<br>
It is not because I care less about the land of (some of) our fathers, it&rsquo;s because the bar keeps having to be raised to get the same level of shock out of me.</p>
<p>This situation is out of my control yes, but I still hate having to accept the unacceptable as reality.</p>
<p>Us White people havn&rsquo;t gone anywhere, we&rsquo;re still here it&rsquo;s just that political correctness has made us invisible and silent.</p>
