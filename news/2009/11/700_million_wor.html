			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neli Esipova and Julie Ray, Gallup, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every day, immigrants leave their homelands behind for new lives in other countries. Reflecting this desire, rather than the reality of the numbers that actually migrate, Gallup finds about 16% of the world&rsquo;s adults would like to move to another country permanently if they had the chance. This translates to roughly 700 million worldwide  &mdash;  more than the entire adult population of North and South America combined.</p>
<p>From its surveys in 135 countries between 2007 and 2009, Gallup finds residents of sub-Saharan African countries are most likely to express a desire to move abroad permanently. Thirty-eight percent of the adult population in the region  &mdash;  or an estimated 165 million  &mdash;  say they would like to do this if the opportunity arises. Residents in Asian countries are the least likely to say they would like to move  &mdash;  with 10% of the adult population, or roughly 250 million, expressing a desire to migrate permanently.</p>
<p><b>United States Tops Desired Destination Countries</b></p>
<p>The United States is the top desired destination country for the 700 million adults who would like to relocate permanently to another country. Nearly one-quarter (24%) of these respondents, which translates to more than 165 million adults worldwide, name the United States as their desired future residence. With an additional estimated 45 million saying they would like to move to Canada, Northern America is one of the two most desired regions.</p>
<p>{snip} Forty-five million adults who would like to move name the United Kingdom or France as their desired destination, while 35 million would like to go to Spain and 25 million would like to relocate to Germany. Thirty million name Saudi Arabia and 25 million name Australia.</p>
<p>Roughly 210 million adults around the world would like to move to a country in the European Union, which is similar to the estimated number who would like to move to Northern America. However, about half of the estimated 80 million adults who live in the EU and would like to move permanently to another country would like to move to another country within the EU  &mdash;  the highest desired intra-regional migration rate in the world.</p>
<p>{snip} Eighty percent of those in developing countries who would like to move permanently to another country would like to move to a developed country, while 13% of respondents in developed countries would like to move to a developing country.</p>
<p><b>Gallup&rsquo;s Potential Net Migration Index</b></p>
<p>{snip} Gallup&rsquo;s Potential Net Migration Index (PNMI) is the estimated number of adults who would like to move out of a country permanently subtracted from the estimated number who would like to move to it, as a proportion of the total population. The higher the resulting positive PNMI value, the larger the potential net population gain.</p>
<p>Across the countries surveyed, Singapore posts the highest positive PNMI of all countries and areas, with a net migration index value of +260%. This means that Singapore&rsquo;s adult population would increase from an estimated 3.6 million to as high as 13 million. The Democratic of the Congo (Kinshasa) posts the highest negative PNMI, with a net migration index value of -60%, which means its adult population would decrease from an estimated 32 million to as low as 13 million.</p>
<p><b>Implications</b></p>
<p>While Gallup&rsquo;s findings reflect aspirations rather than intent, they suggest hundreds of millions are feeling pulled or pushed, for various reasons, toward countries other than their own. {snip}</p>

		<p>The reason so many want to come here is because of several long term influences.  One is our unending foreign aid, whether government or private, paints America as a bountiful, over-generous, and ripe for easy picking.  The other big factor is decades of Christian missionary work.  I have been in very remote places in Eastern Europe and North Africa and it is amazing how everywhere I lived or visited had its Born Again Protestant missionaries, Jehova Witnesses, and Mormons in pairs.  These religious groups recruit and get assylum for many people and often entire families.  Of course, the Catholic Church does more than its share too.  The result is us being crowded out, shouted out, routed out, and bred out - of our own country.</p>
<p>The only question is, will we have a chance to fight this, or are we doomed to just watch ourselves being eliminated daily?</p>

		<p>This is not surprising, but still very scary.  What this survey dramatically illustrates is that third-world immigration cannot be sated as the numbers are just too great.  Therefore, all the gimmicks proposed by politicians such as assimilation and amnesty to cope with immigration are doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Based on this survey, and overwhelming empirical evidence, the highest imperative for national survival pertaining to all first-world nations is immigration control and border defenses.  The desire of many first-world leaders to &#8220;save the world&#8221; is a foolish and dangerous anachronism that belongs to a time that is passed.</p>
<p>Military forces should be brought home from overseas unless absolutely necessary and deployed along the nation&rsquo;s borders.  The intent of having a military is to defend the nation, not to be deployed overseas in endless and futile exercises of idealism.</p>
<p>Failure to effectively defend against this &#8220;demographic warfare&#8221; will result in the first-world nations becoming third-world hell-holes.  Perhaps some enterprising organization should send copies this Gallup survey and the novel &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; to every member of the national legislature.<br>

		<p>This is what makes the liberal leftist democrat fools and Rino&rsquo;s that support open borders such duplicitous morons. On the one hand they support issues such as environmentalism, clean foods, and quality of life issues in general, and yet they would overpopulate this nation and make every single issue they claim to care about a moot point.</p>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it that so many immigrate here and that whites are headed towards becoming a minority, then have larger white families. I will say this every chance I get. Scrimp and save, be conservative in your spending and consumption,it you think you can&rsquo;t afford to raise a larger family. Remember to put your family first, before silly conspicuous consumption such as trips abroad, expensive cars, ridiculous clothing fads and tacky, vulgar, low class music and other fads. We can do it,we can have a thriving, happy white population once again that will not need so many immigrants to our shores. Yes, we can!</p>

		<p>Hmm <br>
Most of those who want to migrate are from Sub Saharan Africa<br>
which still have  explosive birthrates even in those  hell holes with some of the worst net migration index&hellip; Congo,<br>
Zimbabwe&hellip;dont forget Haiti which is African by demographics<br>
but in the wrong continent..<br>
Europe is  facing a hard time trying to fight off these hordes and bribe the Libyans to help control the flow of illegal <br>
African immigration.<br>
I live In Australia and we are facing a growing number of<br>
boat people from Asia once again<br>
 All we need to do is increase the planeloads of African<br>
and other third world refugees which are becoming much more visible in Melbourne  and Sydney  and watch our  positive migration index and wonderful standard of life go down the drain<br>
as per many cities in the late,great USA.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right about this. I have noticed it too. However, Christians are not the sole religious group vigorously promoting immigration in every way possible. Some others promote immigration just for the sake of immigration itself, not even necessarily members of their own sect. You neglected to mention that fact.</p>

<p>    Yes, this is going on. It is mostly a development of the last 30 years. Paradoxically, Christians seem to be the only white group having large families. They could be a big factor in the survival of whites  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t see many white agnostics or atheists with large families.

<p>It is fine and dandy for Whites to have bigger families, but that in no way will stop the demographic replacement of Whites in their own nations. With the MILLIONS of legal and illegal immigrants who invade our nation YEARLY, how can the few Whites of child bearing age ever hope to out breed the Muslims, the Mexicans, the Blacks, the Asians etc.etc???  One more thing Whites are the ones who are paying all the taxes to support those nonwhites to have these big families, thereby cheating Whites the luxury of supporting their own family. The only way Whites can breed and have a desirable environment to raise their children is to have their own LAND, like we used to have before we gave it away to any 3rd worlder that walked in and took it.</p>

<p>No. Those large christian families will only produce bumper crops of mulatto grandchildren. Christians believe that all men are equal before god. They are egalitarians. </p>

<p>Funny, but the fact that the millions who come to the USA (and Europe,too) do not own land doesn&rsquo;t stop them from coming to our shores, does it? The fact that our ancestors from Europe would be outnumbered in North America and face grave dangers of all sorts did not stop them from coming to North America and creating the USA, did it? <br>
The best way to protect a nation, a people, a race is&hellip;to have more of that race. Have larger white families! See, I said it again.</p>

		<p>Anybody who left his doors and windows open all day and night and let anybody and every body come in, sit down in their living room, watch TV, eat in their kitchen, and start living there  would be considered mentally deranged.  Because his house would be emptied of all its wealth and would become an anarchic homeless shelter, with people all over.</p>
<p>Any nation that similarly lets people come in is mentally deranged.  Letting people in a sick, barbaric and evil practice.  It is not a sign of greatness but of a mental derangement at best, a corrupt evil criminal practice more often.</p>
<p>They all want to come to America as they know it is the cheapest &hellip;. that lets everybody and anybody in. That is why they want to come here  &mdash;  precisely because they know it will let them in. </p>
