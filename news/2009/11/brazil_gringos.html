<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34171122/ns/world_news-world_environment/">Brazil: &#8216;Gringos&rsquo; Should Pay to Save Amazon</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, November 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brazil&rsquo;s president said that &#8220;gringos&#8221; should pay Amazon nations to prevent deforestation, insisting rich Western nations have caused much more past environmental destruction than the loggers and farmers who cut and burn trees in the world&rsquo;s largest tropical rain forest.</p>
<p>President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made the comments Thursday just before an Amazon summit in which delegates signed a declaration calling for financial help from the industrial world to halt the deforestation that causes global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want any gringo asking us to let an Amazon resident die of hunger under a tree,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;We want to preserve, but they will have to pay the price for this preservation because we never destroyed our forest like they mowed theirs down a century ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Brazil, the word &#8220;gringo&#8221; does not only mean American, but generally refers to anyone from the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Home to 30 million people</b></p>
<p>Despite the lackluster summit showing, Silva aides said it was important to drive home a message that the Amazon is home to 30 million people, most of whom depend on the forest&rsquo;s natural riches to eke out a living. About 25 million live in Brazil&rsquo;s portion, which has about 60 percent of the Amazon, an area larger than Western Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Europe everyone has opinions about the Amazon, and there are people who think the Amazon is a zoo where you have to pay to enter,&#8221; said Marco Aurelio Garcia, Silva&rsquo;s top foreign policy adviser. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t know there are 30 million who work there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil has managed to reduce Amazon destruction to about 7,000 square kilometers (2,702 square miles) a year, the lowest level in decades. But that is still larger than the U.S. state of Delaware.<br>

		<p>Silva is absolutely right. We have no right to be meddling in Brazil&rsquo;s internal affairs without at least compensating them for the economic losses caused. To pay for the compensation, I suggest an annual 100% tax on the assets of white liberals, who are the primary agitators for this type of meddling. If they complain, they should be stripped of their citizenship and deported down there to Brazil to be near the rainforest and all the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Brazil" rel="nofollow">vibrant diversity</a>&#8221; they claim to love so much. </p>

		<p>Now why would we care what the president of Brazil has to say? The country is little more than a banana republic that&rsquo;s made some advances. Paradise for a few rich, it is a hell hole for most of the population The cities are full of desperate orphans and criminal gangs, the police are as corrupt as any, and disappearances a norm. Just wait until all those rich gringos hit Rio in 2016 for the Olympics! The criminals and gangs that surround Rio are salivating and counting the days. Tell the guy to clean his own toilet first.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Brazilian writing from Brazil. Don&rsquo;t take Lula at face value. He&rsquo;s an ignoramus and a liar. The key for his success is the lack of organized opposition. As for the Amazon, yes, it will continue to be cut and burn, even with gringo&rsquo;s money. In the end, and if everything goes well, parts of the forest will remain as national parks as happened elsewhere.  </p>

		<p>This &#8220;gringo&#8221; has enough trouble worrying about saving his own nation. I could care less what they do to the Amazon. They live there. They can ruin it if they want to. Not one cent of mine will go there voluntarily to save anything in the Amazon. I just don&rsquo;t want them to come here after they&rsquo;ve finished ruining there. </p>

<p>This man thinks he will somehow cow whites worldwide into doing what he wants by using crast, racist epithets.  This guy really seems to think that it is opened season on whites since Obama was elected.  </p>

		<p>Well, we gringos want to help the poor, exploited people of Brazil. A Gringo nuke or two dropped on overpopulated, HIV infested Rio would do more to propel development in Brazil than all the Amazon tree chopping and enviro destruction.  And make that a dirty bomb so we get our money&rsquo;s worth. Eventually Brazil will get the Bomb and try to chase US interests out of South America. A little &#8220;welcome&#8221; neighba, 20 megatons worth, will send the message that these mixed breeds creatures need to shut up and pay respect to the USA.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;In Brazil, the word &lsquo;gringo&rsquo; does not only mean American, but generally refers to anyone from the northern hemisphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And looking at photos of this jackass President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he is probably 100% Portuguese, or a mixture of predominantly Portuguese and a few other Western European ethnicities, such as Spanish and German. He is most definitely not a &ldquo;Latino,&rdquo; mulatto, or mestizo, to be sure. So he can just go ahead and pay for his precious Amazon himself!</p>
<p>I am really sick and tired of these &ldquo;Hispanic whites&rdquo; that play both sides of the fence like this clown; when it suites them to be white they are, but when it comes to the hand outs and other goodies, they magically become &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; or &ldquo;Latin Americans.&rdquo; Vincente Fox was another one, that simply excelled at this duplicity and reveled in riling up hatred of the &ldquo;gringos&rdquo; when it suited him politically. In reality, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t even spit on a mestizo or mulatto if he saw one dying of thirst in a Chihuahua gutter. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>The Brazilians are playing to the Euro left, who have been their useful idiots on climate change for at least the last 10 years. Blame the Americans, say the Brazilians, even though studies show that their tree cutting remains by far the biggest contributor to global climate change. Bigger than all those SUVs and Ohio smokestacks combined.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing Europe&rsquo;s Marxists cherish more than someone from a &#8220;developing&#8221; (i.e. corrupt) country laying all the blame on those nasty capitalists from Yanqui land.</p>

		<p>Well that settles it. Then &#8220;South Americans&#8221; or Mestizos can pay for drug rehabilitation to the Gringos in this country whose lives are ruined everyday by the poison shipped in from the Southern Hemisphere and the dirt poor inhabitants who live there. Let the banana republics and their dictators clean up the streets of the US so us Gringos can live in a civilized society like we used to. </p>

		<p>Legalize drugs now and sink the bananna republics, sink the criminal gangs, allow our users to overdose and put their families out of their combined miseries.  What a relief it would be to take the profit out of drugs.</p>
<p>By the way; America has spent more money on drug interdiction than it has on Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  </p>
<p>The Afghans are thrilled to  know we&rsquo;re sending more soldiers to bleed and die, more money to rebuild a useless and savage country, and still allow heroin fields to exist, while trying to maintain a pipeline for the Saudis&rsquo;.  Aren&rsquo;t we smart?</p>
<p>Tell me again that our Country isn&rsquo;t being destroyed by design.</p>

&#8220;Paradise for a few rich, it is a hell hole for most of the population.&#8221; False: most of the poor loves Brazil while most of the rich despises it. <br>
&#8220;The criminals that surround Rio are salivating [for the 2016 Olympics!]&#8221;. False: As happened before, by means of police and Army deployment, the city will be calm. <br>
&#8220;[Rio is] overpopulated, HIV infested.&#8221; False: Rio metro area has 12 million inhabitants well below NY, LA and even London (Wikipedia). HIV infection rate was 15 per 100 thousand in 2008, less than in NY. <br>
&#8220;Lula is probably 100% Portuguese.&#8221; False: he is definitely a mixture of Portuguese, Indian, Afro and even Dutch, quite common in his region.<br>
&#8220;Developing country means corrupt country.&#8221; Surely Brazil isn&rsquo;t any wonder but what to say of yours truly Chicago, Detroit, New York, Osamo, Plinton, Push, Madoff etc?<br>
&#8220;Lives are ruined everyday by the poison shipped in from the Southern Hemisphere.&#8221; Lives are ruined everyday by the poison demanded from the Northern Hemisphere. Supply creates demand and vice-versa.<br>
&#8220;Mestizo country.&#8221; Yes most of us are mestiços. Nothing is perfect, Nordics included. &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;? No, call us Portugalics, we don&rsquo;t care much for Spain. <br>
Get yourself humble and remember Mussolini: &#8220;Thirty centuries of history allow us to look with supreme pity on certain doctrines which are preached beyond the Alps by the descendants of those who were illiterate when Rome had Caesar, Virgil and Augustus.&#8221;(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifFPsaPeocI) <br>

		<p>&#8220;Unchecked population growth is speeding climate change, damaging life-nurturing ecosystems and dooming many countries to poverty, experts concluded in a conference report. Ninety-eight percent of the expected population growth will occur in developing countries, especially in Africa, where numbers are set to double to almost two billion by 2050.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m real sure the poor stuck in the squalid slums around Rio and elsewhere are having a grand time of it and wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for life in the gated compounds and luxurious palaces, or the freedom to jet all over the world. Give me a break&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oh yes indeed, the criminals are salivating. So are the cops. There&rsquo;ll be money for all&hellip;.</p>

<p>     Why? Beecause it turns out that the only thing &#8220;man-made&#8221; about man-made global warming is the bad science and the hype. But, based on these, the Third World is demanding that white countries fork over trillions of bucks to them in reparations. A shakedown even Jesse Jackson never dreamed of.</p>

<p>Thank you, Anon.   That&rsquo;s a delicious quote!   It certainly proves that history teaches us very little, doesn&rsquo;t it?<br>
Or, better said, not putting the blame on history but in reverse, that most people learn very little from what history tries to teach us.</p>
<p>Oh yes, Mussolini could have mentioned when Rome had triumphal marches, slaves galore, crucifixions, and blood-drenched circuses   &mdash;   but that would have been inconvenient to remember.  How awkward!</p>
<p>PS. I enjoyed your comment. And I agree that Rio&rsquo;s poor, in their ignorance, are happier than the rich   &mdash;   the reason being that (unlike here) there&rsquo;s nobody telling them how miserable they are and how much others owe them. Truly, ignorance is bliss.</p>
