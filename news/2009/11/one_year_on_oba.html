<h1>One Year On, Obamamania Cools to Luke Warm Support</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edouard Guihaire, AFP, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year on from a historic election, the spirit of popular goodwill that yielded America&rsquo;s first black president has retreated to tepid support for Barack Obama as he presses his change agenda.</p>
<p>Since the November 4 poll, Obama&rsquo;s visage has been everywhere, conspicuously on the streets of the nation&rsquo;s capital where millions of foreign and domestic tourists have visited over the past year, many of them snatching up poignant souvenirs.</p>
<p>A quick look around downtown Washington confirms that Obama trinkets are still on sale, but several street hawkers have found little point in displaying the t-shirts, posters, and &#8220;Yes We Can&#8221; buttons bearing the new president&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, Obama&rsquo;s honeymoon with the American people lasted less than six months.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of his inauguration in January, Obama&rsquo;s approval rating soared to 70 percent.</p>
<p>Early on, he tested Americans&rsquo; faith by diving headlong into controversial programs to rescue the economy, including bailing out sinking US auto manufacturers and unleashing a 787-billion-dollar stimulus plan.</p>
<p>In late April, at the end of the first 100 days in office, Obama still enjoyed more positive reviews than his predecessors in the previous 20 years.</p>
<p>But the fall was soon to come as questions started simmering about the president&rsquo;s ability to pull the US economy out of a nosedive.</p>
<p>In July, his popularity dipped even below that of predecessor George W. Bush in the same period of his presidency.</p>
<p>Since mid-October, it has hovered just above 50 percent, a &#8220;significant drop&#8221; from his earlier numbers, according to Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, this puts Obama&rsquo;s current ratings slightly below average for all US presidents since World War II,&#8221; Newport told AFP, noting that the ongoing economic problems are contributing to the curb in enthusiasm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whatever people think back home, Barack Obama&rsquo;s popularity abroad is irrefutable, argues Professor Clyde Wilcox of Georgetown University in Washington.</p>
<p>He is &#8220;the first African-American president, a young man who has won many honors and done great things. He is a cultural phenomenon in the US and around the world,&#8221; Wilcox said.</p>
<p>As such, the conditions remain ripe for more sales, according to Lian Nelson, another street vendor in Washington, who hangs Obama t-shirts alongside those featuring another prominent African-American hero: Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Who is outselling whom? According to Nelson, the &#8220;King of Pop&#8221; is well ahead.<br>

		<p>What does all this mean?  Obama won because of the bad economy, and he was more likeable than John McCain.  Occam&rsquo;s Razor.  Sometimes, we fall into the trap of overanalyzing things.</p>

		<p>I still see &#8220;Obama Collector&rsquo;s Edition&#8221; rags on the magazine rack at the grocery store, but not as many as during the first weeks of this &#8220;historic&#8221; event.</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;cooling off effect&#8221; can be attributed mainly to two bits of excess baggage from the Bush era: Iraq and Afghanistan. Even the syndicated black columnist in my local paper is wondering when Obama is going to get the hell out of there.</p>
<p>True, some whites are probably disappointed the Universe didn&rsquo;t smile on America for electing the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;first black president&#8221; and magically revive the economy in a Karmic shower of gratitude, but I think those two wars are the main reason for the letdown.</p>

		<p>The other day, at the gym, I heard a very black man explaining to another that there was no reason to expect an economic recovery anytime soon, because &#8220;Obama is a Socialist, and&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was amazed, and somewhat encouraged.</p>
<p>Not that disapproval from members of one&rsquo;s own race stops politicians from ignoring the will of the people, these days.  It certainly didn&rsquo;t stop Barbara Bush&rsquo;s child from doing the bidding of the Oligarchs.  I doubt it will stop this new one.</p>

		<p>I think Obama got in partly because people were sick of Bush.  I was sick of Bush too, but I voted for Chuck Baldwin.</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s a lot of buyer&rsquo;s remorse amongst the Obamabots.  Guess that change isn&rsquo;t working out for them.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see. What has BO done? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Promised to close GITMO. Ruined what was left of the economy with those riduculous stimulus plans. Bailed out companies that needed to get themselves out of the fire and back into the pan. And last, but not least, has proposed a health plan to totally ruin anyone&rsquo;s chances of living for very long. America cannot feed, insure, or &#8216;organize&rsquo; the world. In the heighth of its economic cylce, we could not do this. Getting health care back in order, if in fact it was ever out of order, is simply a matter of returning 20 million illegals to their home land. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Well let&rsquo;s see he gave all our money to the bankers rewarding them for wrecking our economy and moved some troops from Iraq so he can send them into Afghanistan. What else&hellip; oops I almost forgot, he also worked with the UN to further erode our liberties and is busy promoting homosexual and feminist rights. That&rsquo;s all I have on my list.</p>
