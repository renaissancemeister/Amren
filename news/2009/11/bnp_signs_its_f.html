	<p>Rajinder Singh, who has appeared on the BNP&rsquo;s internet TV channel, blames Muslims for the death of his father during the Partition of India in 1947</p>
<p>An elderly Sikh who describes Islam as a &#8220;beast&#8221; and once provided a character reference for Nick Griffin during his racial hatred trial is set to become the British National Party&rsquo;s first non-white member.</p>
<p>Rajinder Singh, an anti-Islam activist in his late seventies who blames Muslims for the death of his father during the Partition of India in 1947, has been sympathetic towards Britain&rsquo;s far-right party for much of the past decade even though he currently remains barred from becoming a member because of the colour of his skin.</p>
<p>But last weekend the BNP&rsquo;s leadership took their first steps towards dropping its membership ban on non-whites after the Human Rights Commission threatened the party with legal action. The move will be put to a vote of members soon.</p>
<p>Related articles</p>
<p>Martin Wingfield, the BNP&rsquo;s communications and campaigns officer, has already put forward the case for Mr Singh&rsquo;s membership, telling members on its website: &#8220;I say adapt and survive and give the brave and loyal Rajinder Singh the honour of becoming the first ethnic minority member of the BNP.&#8221;</p>
<p>A BNP spokesman said last night: &#8220;He is perhaps the kind of immigrant you want if you are going to have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Singh, a former teacher from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, says he would be &#8220;honoured&#8221; to become a card-carrying member of the BNP.</p>
<p>Explaining his motives, Mr Singh said: &#8220;I am a retired teacher, living a quiet life. I got in touch with the BNP on certain core policies that appeal to me. I also admire them since they are on their own patch, and do not wish to let anyone else oust them from the land of their ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Singh and another Sikh from Slough who goes by the pseudonym Ammo Singh have previously co-operated with the BNP and have been used by the party&rsquo;s leadership to try to woo Asian supporters, particularly Hindus and Sikhs living in areas where tensions with Muslims run high. The party has had little success, however, with all mainstream Sikh and Hindu groups widely condemning the BNP.</p>
<p>But Rajinder Singh and Ammo Singh  &mdash;  who keeps his identity secret but is thought to be an accountant in his late thirties  &mdash;  have answered Mr Griffin&rsquo;s call, thanks to the BNP&rsquo;s staunchly anti-Islamic rhetoric since September 11.</p>
<p>In December 2001, Ammo Singh claimed he had helped the BNP distribute thousands of anti-Islamic leaflets in Southall, west London, but recently he has kept a low profile. Rajinder Singh, on the other hand, has begun to appear in BNP literature more frequently, writing for the party&rsquo;s newspaper, Freedom, and appearing on the internet television channel, BNPTV.</p>
<p>His intense dislike of Islam appears to stem back to his father&rsquo;s death during the Partition of India, which led to the deaths of an estimated two million Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus. &#8220;I come from partitioned Punjab that saw a lot of bloodshed in 1947,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anyone escaping that genocide would pray to God, [say] never again and vote for BNP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream Sikh groups said they were appalled. Dr Indarjit Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, said: &#8220;Sikhism stresses equality for all human beings. Therefore Sikhs who are true to their faith, will having nothing whatsoever to do with any party that favours any one section of the community.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Good for Mr. Singh&rsquo;s independent thinking. The BNP will of course always be a white-majority party but it can accomodate the very few intelligent aliens who know the score. </p>
<p>The &#8220;mainstream&#8221; joker who talks about not favoring one group over another of course leads a Sikh group which advocates for Sikhs over others.  </p>

		<p>I hope that this shows that not all nonwhite people buy into the propaganda that everyone of their race believes and does the same thing. I am biracial (Asian and White) and I am sick and tired of those groups who cannot and will not assimilate into this society. I am sick and tired of seeing so called groups demanding their &#8220;rights&#8221; and when they do not get their way,it becomes a hate crime. Like that article the other day of the woman that pulled a muslim woman&rsquo;s headscarf is looking at a 5year prison sentence for what? They also demand the right to wear the headscarf when they go to the dmv to get their driver&rsquo;s license and are offended when they are told to remove the scarf or no license. They do not understand that this is for security reasons and besides, with the headscarf, how can you tell who the really are?</p>

While few of us may welcome this, so long as non-whites who join support the efforts of the BNP, they should be allowed to join.</p>
<p>What you have to watch out for is the sneaky ones who join on the pretext of supporting the BNP but are actually working their way into the group to destroy it.</p>
<p>It should be made clear in the charter that the principles of the group are not open to debate or change. If someone joins and then proposes changes, there should be a prevision to have the troublemakers removed.<br>

		<p>Bravo.  I&rsquo;d like to think that if I were a non-white citizen in England that I would sign up for the BNP too.  A nation with a large white majority secure in itself and in the preservation  of the civilization it had built over centuries would be the most tolerant, decent and civilized place that I could imagine living in.  </p>

<p>You mean everybody has the equal right to call himself English?  I wonder how many Sikh organizations are obligated to accept non-Sikhs.  Here is an article that disputes the Sikh rejection of the caste system:</p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of Muslims in India, Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, recognized in the 1940&rsquo;s that it was hopeless for Hindus and Muslims to live side-by-side in India. He felt that Gandhi was living in a fantasy world by preaching Hindu-Muslim unity, since Muslims would be constantly agitating for their own state, dissatisfied living under non-Muslim rule. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>History books without exception portray Godse as &#8220;a fanatic&#8221;. He was NOT. He wrote out a 92-page deposition at his trial, in which he blamed Gandhi and Mountbatten for the partition of India, and the loss of nearly one-third of her territory. He hated Gandhi  for tolerating Muslims in India, because he felt Muslims would eventually seek to destroy India. He also resented Gandhi for going on these long &#8220;fasts unto death&rsquo; designed to punish Hindus for not being accomodating to Muslims. Gandhi knew that Muslims cared not one iota if he starved himself to death, so his fasts were intended to &#8216;punish&#8221; Hindus into making concessions to Muslims. He, of course, demanded nothing from Muslims.<br>
This was too much for Godse, and so he acted with a close-knit cadre of associates to liquidate Gandhi. Nevertheless, at his trial he declared that he would take sole responsibility for said liquidation.<br>
Godse knew over 60 years ago, that Muslims as a minority cannot peacefully co-exist with non-Muslims, in any country on Earth. So why are pols and academia trying to peddle that multicultural garbage to us?</p>
<p>You can look up Nathuram Godse in Wikipedia, and at the bottom of the page in the &#8216;External References&#8221; section, it will direct you to a site dedicated to Godse.  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly the first non-white BNP member is an elderly Sikh gentleman whose main motive is that really, <i>really</i> hates Islam. But he seems sincere, and if he&rsquo;s helped out Nick Griffin in the past, he should fit in just fine. <br>
 <br>
I&rsquo;ll bet they find UK has lots of old-skool former colonial immigrants who are genuinely assimilated and patriotic   &mdash;   and therefore sympathetic to BNP   &mdash;   who will join the party once they feel they are welcome to do so. Especially among Sikhs and your better sort of Hindus   &mdash;   but I predict we&rsquo;ll see BNP support even to a certain extent amongst older, more settled Caribbean blacks. <br>
 <br>
Just no Muslims. Those people clearly can&rsquo;t be successfully integrated into Western countries, let alone into a nationalist political party. </p>

		<p>I agree with the slippery slope argument.  </p>
<p>Many Asians are conservatives by nature, and when they see the political weathervane shifting right, they will seek a presence there. </p>
<p>Numbers are the essence.  If they join the party in sufficient numbers, they will internally vote as a bloc at party elections, splitting the BNP into ethnic factions.  This is happening in the Canadian political landscape.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to limit them to token representation.</p>

		<p>They say the principles of Sikhism include brotherly love, care for others, non-violence, and equality for all human beings. In spite of their best intentions I don&rsquo;t believe they can live up to their ideals. They will run into conflicts with ethnic British and other immigrant groups in Britain despite their high sounding principles. Sikh religion authorities actually don&rsquo;t know what their religion really is. Tell us what Sikhism becomes when the principles can&rsquo;t be lived up to. </p>

		<p>Sigh. This is how it always starts, by compromising our cultural values to accept people who are different in exchange for their loyalty and support. That concept ruined America, it ruined the Republican Party, and now, it stands to ruin the BNP. I sincerely hope that I am not the only one who sees this!</p>
<p>My friends, our existence should serve to foster and extend our cultural preservation. There is no room for compromise in that principle. Allowing in people like Mr. Singh undermines what we believe in.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Singh appears to be a decent person. I would support him forming a coalition of conservative Indians, in India, where he belongs.</p>
<p>Stop yielding ground and compromising your values, my friends! Frankly, that&rsquo;s all we have left in the world today.<br>

		<p>While all of us can see why the BNP feels the need to go this route, I for one am not convinced this is the right path to travel. This has that same familiar sound as the American conservative position that non-whites are fine&hellip;so long as they think the right thoughts. But is that realistic? These non-whites have children and their children have children, etc. Once you open this door it can rarely, if ever, be closed! </p>
<p>I suppose it is a necessity of sorts for the BNP&rsquo;s survival - but it may also be a move they come to regret profoundly over time.  </p>

<p>You are absolutely right Francois. A &#8220;few&#8221; of any given minority (ethnic OR religious) would not harm, and probably would help the BNP (image wise) but once any minority group senses they have sufficient numbers they will immediatly begin agitating for the BNP to make ideological changes that favor THEIR faction.<br>
If you are going to have a Party, Group or Club it should always have an iron-clad, non-ammendable charter so the goals remain the same no matter the membership. That would weed out sabateurs aiming to foment internal change.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck has talked about this being one reason the GOP&rsquo;s &#8220;big tent&#8221; strategy has failed so miserably. <br>
Let in too many &#8220;outsiders&#8221; and soon there are more &#8220;outsiders&#8221; than &#8220;insiders&#8221; and the original Purpose of the group gets watered down or outright flipped around.</p>

		<p>To white advocate - Canada:</p>
<p>The Sikhs profess non-violence? Since when? Indira Gandhi&rsquo;s Sikh bodyguards assassinated her in 1984.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Hindus went on a rampage, and when it was over, the Indian Department of Streets and Sanitation had to sweep up some 1,000 Sikh corpses.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me the Sikhs are a people of peace. On planet Earth, there is no such thing.</p>

		<p>The mainstream media give a blanket statement &#8220;he&rsquo;s only joining because he hates Islam&#8221;. This is a half-truth. Watch the Rajinder Singh BNP interview clips below. He says the white indigenous majority need to maintain rule over Britain &#8220;in a virile and manly manner&#8221; (Correctly identifies the need for greater self-assertiveness amongst whites, just as Jared Taylor has) or else minorities like himself will be wiped out by aggressive muslims and others. His politics is no different from that of ours really. He knows that white dominanance must be maintained for a healthy Libertarian society to prevail. He has seen how muslims have wrecked India, and thats subsequently why he had to flee to Britain for refuge. He has worked hard all his life so he can enjoy the FREEDOMS of a white European society. He hasnt done that only so that Leftist whites can give it away in a weak effeminate way to marauding muslim hordes. He also rightly identifies how the Leftist UK government (and other European governments) have let in millions of young single non-white males. He knows like we do that this is storing up trouble. They are indeed a fifth column as he points out. This man is no fake (not like all those non-white Republicans that showed their true colours when Obama ran for office, or that fool Michael Steele), he is genuine. You can tell by his words and actions. The BNP should not let in any other non-whites but they certainly would do well to grant Mr Singh membership!</p>

		<p>Ive always been surprised by the number of non white non muslims (important point) that are pro BNP. They too are sick of immigrants flooding the country and causing problems, many blacks and Asians I know have been here for 30 + years and are as English in behaviour as I am.</p>
<p>The dislike like and distain of Islam as a whole is pretty universal, so I hope the BNP, do well out of this.</p>

		<p>I cannot for the life of me understand some of the comments on this article. Those posters who think this is okay has got to be kidding? We, or most of us, know when Whites have allowed even ONE nonwhite among them and especially in their political party, it will soon be compromised. WHY is it always Whites who have to cave in to the other races and religions? Where is that written? That is our downfall. So naive, soft and altruistic we have become.</p>

		<p>While I comend this older Sikh gentleman who supporting the BNP, this will set a bad precedent.  What other non-white groups will the BNP let in next?  And whose to say that those other non-white Brits won&rsquo;t try to alter the BNP to be more &#8220;politically correct&#8221;?  Even Malcolm X said he didn&rsquo;t want whites to help a black group, even if they support the blacks&rsquo; agenda, because eventually it would serve more of the interests of the whites who joined.  </p>

		<p>The BNP is playing a dangerous game by allying itself with and even praising Islam&rsquo;s enemies such as the Sikhs and Hndus.  Yes, Islam is the top priority, and there can be cold calculated efforts to accomplish as much as possible within the current situation, but the BNP and its members must become careful not to believe their own hype and see Sikhs as the &#8220;good&#8221; non-whites.</p>
<p>See White America&rsquo;s article about the Sikhs of Vancouver to realize what a city- and nation-ruining nuisance, and even menace, the Sikhs can be all on their own, without many or any Muslims around.</p>

		<p>Very good article and web site poster #21&hellip;Thanks for posting it. The BNP is in for a rude awakening, but I think they knew that before they were forced to admit NONwhites, so I do not understand why they don&rsquo;t fight that insanity or they will lose their party if they don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>The BNP had to make accommodations for non-whites in order to survive.  The cost of fighting the legislation would have been staggering.  Governments have unlimited resources.  The UK has NO freedom of speech and no freedom of association.  What they need to do is get into Parliament so that they can overturn such legislation.</p>
<p>The only alternative would have been to have large (hundreds of thousands) of British Subjects march on the Houses of Parliament and protest the law.  I don&rsquo;t know how they could have accomplished that.</p>
<p>Funny thing is the British are now Subjects of Parliament and not the Sovereign.  Even she is a subject of the elected officials who have NO LOVE or LOYALTY to their own nation.  Sad turn of events.<br>

		<p>Thank you, 22.  Having said what I said, I do want to note also that while it is certainly morally defensible for the BNP to want to keep themselves all-white or even all-British Isles (thus excluding Poles, Greeks, Finns, etc), such a course is not the only available principled one for them to adopt, even in the absence of external coercion.</p>
<p>Recall &#8220;The Camp of the Saints&#8221;, in which one of the final defenders of the white West as it is being overrun is a South Asian, who knows full well that he is going to die, but decides that this losing fight is worth it.  In other words he so values and respects the West and white people that he wants to fight on our side to protect us from his own kind.  And he is not fighting for abstract values or universal ideals but white people as such, exclusively.</p>
<p>In my opinion it would be perfectly honorable for the BNP to accept such a person as a member.</p>
<p>Where they should exercise great care is in accepting certain non-whites who join as a way of lashing out at rival non-whites but lack love and loyalty for Britain AS A NATION-STATE OF ETHNIC BRITONS.  It may be pragmatically necessary for the BNP to accept some of the latter variety of members, but they should never be fully trusted and should not be allowed to weaken the BNP&rsquo;s policies.</p>
<p>I think it may be possible for the BNP to appeal to non-whites, even those who have not fully accepted or appreciated the idea of Britain for Britons, by using the analogy of the goose and the golden eggs.  To tell the Jamaicans and Pakistanis and what have you something like this, dressed up or watered down by whatever code or euphemism the UK&rsquo;s speech laws make  necessary:</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have continued to live surrounded by other Jamaicans or Pakistanis back in Jamaica or Pakistan, but chose to be surrounded by Britons instead.  Clearly we Britons create a pleasant, safe, prosperous society that attracts you in a way that your own people and own societies do not.  So you should want to keep Britain British and help us keep your ethnic kinsmen that you fled from out of this country, to prevent it from becoming what you went through such effort to get away from.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think a certain portion of non-whites might respond favorably to such bracing candor.</p>

		<p>It is worth noting that the Council of Conservative Citizens has accepted non-whites as members for many years, and:</p>
<p>1.  The number of non-white members is still small.<br>
2.  The Council still manages to fight for white interests. </p>

No more so than Indians of Mr Singh&rsquo;s generation who actually loved their English schooling aquired in India provided by real English teachers but this does not apply to inhabitants of Pakistan and Bangladesh. I cannot help but contrast this love of education with the sad situation in Britain today when the majority of students, especially immigrants, despise school, teachers, education, discipline and, indeed, anything remotely useful and complain about being &#8216;bored init&rsquo;. The BNP has been targeted by our communist labour party and their absolute devotion to bringing in millions of illiterates who are alien to our culture, language and way of life in a declared intention of &#8216;spiting the right&rsquo;. As soon as the BNP membership rules have been changed to suit the same people who insist that our fishermen dump perfectly good fish back into the sea because of EU rules, then the sooner we can buckle down to outing this fetid scottish dominated bunch of cheats and scoundrels along with their appointed alien ministers. Perhaps the rules should also be changed in respect of muslim criminals who are still in UK living in free housing and drawing cash benefits despite promises that they will be deported. They are represented by lawyers paid for by the state. Meanwhile, our troops who were injured and maimed fighting the same alien hordes are sill fighting here in UK to be granted decent treatment, housing and compensation. These rule changes by the BNP are a victory for the communists who totally ignore other, far more important rules, which really deserve attention but use the BNP to distract the UK population away from the real issues facing our broken society. </p>

		<p>The day South Africa started accommodating other population groups (it started under Vorster), even in small numbers, it was the start of the end.</p>
<p>The BNP is feeling the pressures white South Africa had to content with from the international boycott, which also pressured the government of the day to open up to other race groups. Now you have an idea what is was like to have stayed in South Africa during the 1970-80&rsquo;s. We had the same problem. Study our country and what it had to content with in order to find a solution for the BNP and others. You have a lot more intellectual whites (higher population than us) so someone should be able to find a solution. You will have to avoid the pitfalls we fell into. </p>
<p>What is the solution? I think there is no easy solution, mostly it depends if the captain of the ship is of such a strong personality that he is still able to go through the rough seas.</p>
<p>At the end quality counts, quantity is only a short term solution.</p>

		<p>The BNP&rsquo;s constitution operates a cadre system in which only members with a track record of public activism have any influence within the party - this is to stop arm-chair hardliners and leftist moles from derailing the party.

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand a lot of the comments here.  The people against this seem to be under the illusion that the BNP had a CHOICE in letting in non-white members.  The alternative was a costly court battle that would have been made irrelevant regardless of the outcome with the new anti-white &#8220;Equality&#8221; bill that&rsquo;s coming out (or has it already been passed?) anyways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it anymore than you do, but let&rsquo;s not pretend like there was another option that available that didn&rsquo;t lead to the death of the party.</p>

<p>All the Brits I talked to hate the BNP and automatically say that they are nazis, they confuse nationalists with nazis.</p>
<p>Sadly, the greatest people ever are firmly on their way out of history in the worst case or on their way to a balkanized country that will not last.</p>
<p>The British however are weaker than the Serbs, they will not fight for their territory.</p>

		<p>  This is a smart tactical maneuver on the part of the BNP. The Fourth Estate has been harping on the fact that only &#8220;whites&#8221; can join the BNP; now this has been stopped that nonsense. I also don&rsquo;t see massive numbers of South Asians joining the BNP anytime soon. </p>
<p>What the BNP should now concentrate on is getting a collective leadership to eventually replace the charismatic Nick Griffin.  In addition, they need to attract younger members to the party. I see too many middle aged and older people at their meetings. I admire Mr. Griffin but he seems the only party spokesman. This is not healthy. <br>

		<p>Over time, non-white members will start demanding, using the threat of playing the race discrimination card, that they be chosen as BNP election candidates across the county.  This is bound to happen in predominately White areas too where they succeed in securing candidature by menaces. </p>
<p>There is no way a non-white candidate will be prepared to work to support White ethnic interests even in a predominately White area.  Once it becomes obvious that representing the interests and human rights of indigenous Britons only, for which the BNP was rightfully founded in the first place is no longer truly possible, direct action will be the only alternative course of action left open.</p>
<p>Apparently, as a tactical &#8216;Defeat the BNP&rsquo; strategy, the Black Police Association have already opened membership to non-Blacks, but because they are not a political party, they are not bound by legislation regarding the electing of non-Black high-profile official representation and suchlike as the BNP will eventually be. </p>

		<p>This article is so interesting I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin. However, there are several questions I would very much like to ask:</p>
<p>1. Upon accepting this Sikh as a member, will the BNP be forced to pander to non-whites in a manner similar to other organizations in order to avoid punishment for violating &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws? Or will they reaffirm their commitment to whites?</p>
<p>2. Is this Sikh genuine in his beliefs regarding Islam and his support of the BNP&rsquo;s doctrine, or is he simply trying to infiltrate the BNP and expose them to the treacherous white liberal elites of the United Kingdom?</p>
<p>3. Even if this non-white member does genuinely support the BNP, will his presence really make a difference? Unless he speaks for a substantial percentage of non-whites in Britain (which I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t), then he will merely be a token. </p>
<p>Perhaps this man may think differently, but most non-whites in Britain eagerly await the demise of native Europeans, and will do anything in their power to facilitate that decline. </p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the Right seems always to be identified with &#8220;racism&#8221;,  whereas  the two issues are really very separate things.  Or should be.</p>
<p>Perhaps what Britain needs is a Racist Left, to counteract the Labour Party and siphon off its supporters.   Preserve the welfare state, but expel the immigrants! Then Labour couldn&rsquo;t &#8220;spite the right&#8221;.  I am sure there are MANY working class voters who do not identify with the elitist racial policies that the Labourites force on them, policies which are actually contrary to working people&rsquo;s own interests,  but up until now they have been barred from having anywhere else to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for Mr. Singh&rsquo;s independent thinking. The BNP will of course always be a white-majority party but it can accomodate the very few intelligent aliens who know the score. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; joker who talks about not favoring one group over another of course leads a Sikh group which advocates for Sikhs over others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; All nations benefit more with a 10% (approx) level of minority population than with none at all.  But more than that and it becomes a problem.  Over that amount independent enclaves develope and a nation begins to Balkanize.  Insistence otherwise is ignorant at best, subversive and traitoress at worst. <br>

		<p>In response to comment #35 I think it&rsquo;s really impossible to have a left-wing party that opposes immigration because the moment it opposes immigration the left will say it&rsquo;s far right.  For example the BNP is effectively just the Old Labour party but with a tougher stance on immigrants, they just define it as far-right in order to make them seem more extreme and lessen their support.</p>

		<p>This has already been mentioned once or twice, but I think it bears repeating: the BNP has been forced by the British government into adopting this policy. If they were not being threatened with legal sanctions and/or financial ruin, I seriously doubt that they would have agreed to take on nonwhite members. As has been stated before on the BNP web site, this action was taken to ensure the party&rsquo;s survival in the face of concerted efforts to destroy it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, allowing nonwhites to join the BNP does deprive the party&rsquo;s enemies of any credible claim that the party is still &#8220;racist.&#8221; The BNP may ultimately emerge a stronger force because of this move.</p>
