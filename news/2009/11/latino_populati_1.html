			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Davidson, Deseret News (Salt Lake City), November 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study says that six of the eight states that are expected to gain U.S. House seats from the 2010 Census  &mdash;  all except Utah and Georgia  &mdash;  would not receive them without recent population growth among Hispanics, which may make Latinos more politically powerful.</p>
<p>And while Utah likely would gain an expected fourth House seat even without help from the state&rsquo;s Hispanic growth, Latinos still created 25 percent of recent growth, adding about 128,000 of the 503,000 additional people in the state since 2000 and making them increasingly important politically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The states likely to gain political power following the 2010 Census are currently largely Republican dominated&#8221; and in most cases &#8220;will owe this expanded power to Latinos who moved to their states,&#8221; says the study by the America&rsquo;s Voice Education Fund, an organization based in Washington, D.C., that advocates comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ironically, many members of the delegations who will benefit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have embraced policies that are hostile to Latinos and immigrants. It will be interesting to see how the 2010 Census impacts politicians&rsquo; attitudes toward immigrants and Latinos who help them expand their powers in Congress,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study projects that eight states will gain seats in the upcoming census  &mdash;  Texas (gaining four), Arizona (gaining two) and one each for Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah. Each House seat gained also brings an extra vote in the Electoral College.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eleven states would lose seats, the study said  &mdash;  Ohio (losing two) and one each by Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.</p>

		<p>In the case of TX and AZ, half the new districts will be won by Republicans, half won by Democrats, I predict.  AZ got 2 new ones in 2000, one went R and one went D.  So it&rsquo;s a wash for either side.  </p>
<p>But, all the states that gain districts will also have more electoral college votes.  If it pans out as this study projects, assuming that, in the 2000, 04 and 08 Presidential elections, that if the Democrats won a state all three times, it&rsquo;s a blue state, a state that Rs won all three times, it&rsquo;s a red state, and states that voted R and D once or twice each are swing states, and noting TX, AZ and OH&rsquo;s multiple district gain or loss, then red states will gain 8 electoral votes, blue states will lose 7 electoral votes, and swing states will lose 2 electoral votes.  This gives the Republican candidate for President a marginal edge vs Obama in 2012, by then the new electoral counts will be in effect.</p>

		<p>When will states with shrinking population lose their congressional seats? I&rsquo;m guessing the prairie states will be first.</p>

		<p>pardon no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>we are witnessing the first of a takeover of parts of the united states by latinos and their sheer numbers. remember the slogan&hellip;&#8221;today we march, tomorrow we vote&#8221;. remember how many millions that came out of  what the liberals love to call &#8221;the shadows&#8221; to march and protest about 2 and 1/2 years ago the anti-illegal immigration legislation that came before congress. it was breathtaking to me how many latinos united and took to the streets. indeed i was amazed at how many poured &#8221;out of the shadows&#8221; to wave mexican flags. they have reached a overwhelming mass in our cities. the bush administration - urged on by liberal republicans like john mccain and lindsay - looked the other way and took no action. this would have been a perfect time for an illegal immigrant &#8221;roundup&#8221;. no action by bush alone telegraphed to the organizers and participants that the administration was soft on illegal immigration. trust me friends, this is a hot button issue. when obama tries to pass an amnesty - and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time; health care first - expect a ultra strong showing and resistance like we&rsquo;ve never witnessed. hopefully by then we will have been successful at kicking a few of these uber-liberals out of congress. hopefully we will have enough conservative lawmakers by then to make passage of the destructive amnesty bill not possible.</p>
<p>anyone remember the mexican flags that were being waved proudly in the first few days of these marches. then magically, they dumped the mexican flags and began waving american flags. is anyone aware of where all those thousands of american flags came from. according to rush limbaugh and a few more reliable conservative sources, they were provided by the barreful from communist front organizations.<br>
i considered the sources reliable. these true far-left groups - even further left than a.c.o.r.n. and the southern poverty law center - with their small size were the ones behind these marches. they are aiding and abetting as well as helping organize a latino takeover of the country. anyone with a computer can do a &#8221;google search&#8221; and find out this information.<br>
and with obama-appointed janet napalitano as nation security advisor, the former arizona governor who became famous for her refusal to secure the porous arizona border - the u.s. border is as wide open as ever and it is unlikely the fence will be completed, or even continue to be erected under this administration. by 2012 america will have been flooded with a few more million mexican nationals as well as what the border security refer to as &#8221;other than mexican&#8221; - or &#8221;o.t.m.&rsquo;s&#8221; - are middle easterners who at a distance can pass as mexicans. it may not happen during this adminstration, but i fear sooner or later one of these &#8221;o.t.m.&rsquo;s&#8221; will smuggle in a nuclear suitcase bomb. we all know these folks are not at all afraid to die and after all, would get their &#8216;74 virgins&rsquo; and visit allah when the nuclear device is detonated and flattens a city the size of houston or phoenix. only when this happens - and this administration&rsquo;s back is up against the wall - will they be forced to take action and truly take border security seriously. <br>
i hope i&rsquo;m wrong, but nothing short of a catastrophe such as this it seems will make our government be forced to seal the dadburn border.<br>
well i&rsquo;ve had my rant. i don&rsquo;t need to go into the catastrophic<br>
result many more mexicans - many with long arrest records i.e. &#8221;rap sheets&#8221; - will have downstream on this country.<br>
like i said&hellip;i hope i&rsquo;m wrong.  </p>
