<h1><a href="https://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1937334,00.html">Did the Army Ignore Red Flags Because of Hasan&rsquo;s Religion?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Thompson, Time, November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As officials continue to investigate the alleged Fort Hood killer, it is looking increasingly likely that the Army missed several red flags in Major Nidal Malik Hasan&rsquo;s behavior. Many observers say it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if such signals had been missed, given that Hasan was a psychiatrist whom the Army desperately needed to help tend to the mental wounds of two wars. But at the same time, some members of the military are quietly discussing the more troubling possibility that the Army looked the other way precisely because Hasan was Muslim.</p>
<p>Army officials strongly deny any suggestion that Hasan&rsquo;s religion resulted in his being given special treatment. But one officer who attended the Pentagon&rsquo;s medical school with Hasan disagrees. &#8220;He was very vocal about being a Muslim first and holding Shari&rsquo;a law above the Constitution,&#8221; this officer recalls. When fellow students asked, &#8220;How can you be an officer and hold to the Constitution?,&#8221; the officer says, Hasan would &#8220;get visibly upset  &mdash;  sweaty and nervous  &mdash;  and had no good answers.&#8221; This medical doctor would speak only anonymously because his commanders have ordered him not to talk about Hasan, he says.</p>
<p>This officer says he was so surprised when Hasan gave a talk about &#8220;the war on terror being a war on Islam&#8221; that he asked the lieutenant colonel running the course what Hasan&rsquo;s presentation had to do with health care. &#8220;I raised my hand and asked, &#8216;Why are you letting this go on  &mdash;  this has nothing to do with environmental health.&rsquo; The course director said, &#8216;I&rsquo;m just going to let him go.&rsquo;&#8221; The topic of Hasan&rsquo;s presentation, the officer says, had been approved in advance by the lieutenant colonel.</p>
<p>{snip} (The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Hasan gave a similar presentation at Walter Reed in which he said Muslims should be released as conscientious objectors rather than forced into combat against fellow Muslims.) But &#8220;political correctness&#8221; inside the military, the officer asserts, insulated Hasan. &#8220;People are afraid to come forward and challenge somebody&rsquo;s ideology,&#8221; he says, &#8220;because they&rsquo;re afraid of getting an equal-opportunity complaint that can end careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Ralph Peters, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who now writes military books and a newspaper column, contends that Hasan&rsquo;s religion protected him from punitive action by the Army, a view shared privately by many in uniform. While stressing &#8220;there shouldn&rsquo;t be witch hunts&#8221; against Muslims in uniform, Peters insists &#8220;this guy got a pass because he was a Muslim, despite the Army&rsquo;s claim that everybody&rsquo;s green and we&rsquo;re all the same.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This absolutely true. </p>
<p>For too many members of the military and federal civil servants embracing multiculturalism and diversity are mandatory. Failure to promote minorities can adversely affect a managerial employee&rsquo;s promotion prospects in the bureaucracy. Managers receive ratings based upon their abilities to promote minorities. Having a civil rights complaint filed against you is a serious matter, even if you are exonerated. Needless to say, there are more civil rights and harassment complaints filed in the government sector than in most private industries. </p>

		<p>Hopefully, Hasan will get word out that he is indeed a jihadist and meant every utterance of condemnation he leveled during his lectures.  Of course, the powers that be will do everything to see that this doesn&rsquo;t happen, and in the case of a military trial I guess everything can be keep under wraps.  How the Islamic terror community must laugh at the weak, silly West!  </p>

		<p>I have what I think is an interesting comparrison:  gays versus muslims.  Gays are specifically excluded from military service.  If they are found out after enlistment they are expelled.  Openly homosexual servicemen are considered bad for unit cohesion.  Despite pressure from gay groups and politicians the Pantagon has stuck to it&rsquo;s guns.  Even though the Pentagon knows that many gays have served  honorably throughout the previous century and now.  Most gays are discharged for being found out to be homosexual, not for dereliction of duty.  Why can&rsquo;t we have the same policy for muslims?  Can muslims be good soldiers and loyal Americans, yes.  Can muslims be a threat to good order and unit cohesion, yes.  The military is not normal civilian life.  The military needs rules it feels contribute to an efficient defense machine.  If that means some people are left out, so be it.  These men keep me free and I am not going to second guess them.</p>

		<p>Of course they did. Just like cops are leery of black suspects sreaming &#8216;racism&#8221;, the Army officers wouldn&rsquo;t want to confront Hasan.After all it might be &#8220;mean&#8221; or &#8220;bigoted&#8221;, to feel a Muslim was posing a threat.  I mean, he only praised suicide bombers and behaved in an irrational manner.And to think, this guy was a psychologist! Could his training have included lessons about how the U.S. persecutes&#8221; minorities? Maybe he viewed himself as a victim of U.S. persecution?</p>

<p>Laughably, this reminds of another folly that had disastrous consequences for the country involved, simply because its leaders would not accept coherent certainty and threatened destruction for all stating the obvious. Of course, this country was Stalin&rsquo;s USSR and the onslaught that followed these officially imposed denials of reality, was Hitler&rsquo;s 1941 invasion of that Communist paradise. When it was all over, some 20 to 25 million people would be dead there, but sometimes that is the price of Marxist utopia.</p>
<p>An excellent example of this that I once read about in a book on Barbarossa and Stalingrad, was the fact that in Berlin a Soviet spy was tipped off by a printer and secret KPD member, that he had obtained a new contract with the Nazi government in the Spring of 1941. It was a massive order for a new German-Russian phrase translation pamphlet, that included such ambiguous requests as: &ldquo;Surrender and drop your weapons;&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you happen to be a Communist;&rdquo; and my personal favorite, &ldquo;Please point to the chairman of the collective farm.&rdquo; A copy was given to the spy and he got it back to Moscow; long story short, he was eventually arrested and executed by the NKVD in Moscow at Comrade Stalin&rsquo;s command for being &ldquo;provocative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kind of sounds familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>This site recently reported on a bill before Congress to ban members of &#8220;hate groups&#8221; from enlisting. &#8220;Hate groups&#8221; mean anyone who stands up for whites, no matter how truthful, peaceful or patriotic they are.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had this explained to me by a civilian working for the police in the UK as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;When it come to race and Islam, very police officer and Home Office bureaurocrat knows that there are two doors in from of him or her. One door leads to recognition and promotion. The other leads to career death.&#8221;</p>
<p>So mosques are not searched for weapons or drugs or explosives and police sniffer dogs have to be used - if at all - with great care for fear of offending Muslims&rsquo; sensitivities.</p>
<p>Simple enough.</p>
<p>One presumes the same general rule applies in the US armed forces and civil service.</p>

		<p>  Of course, the military ignored warning signs that Major Hasan was a Muslim religious fanatic. They were in the Politically Correct &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Pretend&#8221; mode. The gruesome cult of Politically Correct Multiculturalism can&rsquo;t admit to any philosophical failings. It has a Marxist like dogma that feels threatened by any dissent or criticism  &mdash;  even if lives may be lost by adhering to agreeable Multicult fantasies.</p>

<p>I must respectfully disagree here, I believe NO muslims should be in the U.S. military, in any capacity, ZERO TOLERANCE on this I would say. Muslims put faith and ideaology before everything and everything before our Constitution! BUT THEN! so too does our congress and senate put everything ahead of our Constitution, especially their own political and financial advancement.</p>

		<p>Political correctness is a faulty construct of modern liberalism (and no I&rsquo;m not referring to classical liberalism). This incident is a perfect example of it. It the days before political correctness the situation would have been handled long before it reached the point of causing death and great bodily harm. </p>
<p>But the negative results of political correctness are permitted to occur and accepted by our modern liberal society because they understand that political correctness is a powerful tool to bring about their ultimate fascist goal of an all-powerful people&rsquo;s State. A state which always trumps the individual and firmly controls all aspects of the population&rsquo;s culture, education, defense or military expansion, information, health and economy. </p>
<p>This nanny totalitarianism makes perfect﻿ sense to the modern liberal whose end is exactly like that of Chinese communism&hellip; an authoritarian political worldview the modern liberal idolizes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the modern liberal desires the United Nations to act as a politburo ruling over all the, by then, fascist states of the world. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious.</p>

		<p>As far as I am concerned this recent fiasco confirms Michael <br>
Scheuer&rsquo;s comment that the elites of this country are not interested in protecting the lives of Americans. This was, on a microcosmic scale, what will happen when the Muslims set off a nuclear or a major biowarfare device. Confusion as to why it wasn&rsquo;t prevented; avoidance of responsibility, and of course a lot of casualties.</p>

<p>In theory, yes. In practice, no. I&rsquo;ve come across several articles stating that homosexuals in the Army have &#8220;come out&#8221; to their supervisors, only to be told, &#8220;How interesting. Now get back to work.&#8221; The Army is desperate for warm bodies, to the point that it now disregards its own regulations.</p>
<p>By the same token, Hasan was able to make major in spite of the red flags because the Army has a huge shortage of that rank.</p>
