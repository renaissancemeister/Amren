<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/09/ny-hate-crimes-on-rise/">N.Y. Hate Crimes on Rise</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Eltman, Washington Times, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There had been other high-profile attacks on a growing Hispanic population on eastern Long Island before Ecuadorean immigrant Marcelo Lucero was stabbed to death a year ago Sunday on a street corner.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until the seven teens accused in the killing told police of the attacks  &mdash;  and Hispanic residents who had been long silent about hate crimes came forward to confirm the stories  &mdash;  that officials began to realize what they were dealing with.</p>
<p>The year since the Lucero slaying has put a national spotlight on race relations and has seen the U.S. Justice Department launch a probe of hate crimes and police response to them. A national civil rights group released a study that found &#8220;a pervasive climate of fear in the Latino community&#8221; in Suffolk County.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many victims said they had always been reluctant to contact police, fearing they would be asked about their immigration status. Just weeks after presiding at a funeral for Lucero, a preacher invited Hispanic crime victims to share their experiences. Dozens came forward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lucero, 37, came to the United States when he was 21 and worked at a dry cleaner. He was walking with a friend shortly before midnight near the Patchogue train station when they were confronted by a mob of teens. His friend ran away, but Lucero was surrounded, prosecutors say.</p>
<p>He tried to fight back, flailing at the assailants with his belt. At some point, 18-year-old Jeffrey Conroy plunged a knife into Lucero&rsquo;s chest before running away, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>They strengthened their case against the teens this week when one pleaded guilty to conspiracy and hate crime charges and agreed to testify against the others. The other six defendants, including Mr. Hartford, Kevin Shea and Jose Pacheco, have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Nicholas Hausch also admitted to participating in other attacks on Hispanics, confessing he and his cohorts frequently used racial epithets when confronting victims. In one attack, Mr. Hausch said, they shot a BB gun at a Hispanic man.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obdulio deLeon, a cast member who arrived from Guatemala 23 years ago, says even now, newcomers live in fear. The volunteer EMT said some are even afraid to call for a doctor when they&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to call 911,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to call the ambulance or call police for anything. If they get beat up or they get picked on, they just let it be.&#8221;<br>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to call 911,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to call the ambulance or call police for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we should feel sorry for these people or what??? They chose to come here (legally or illegally) and they ARE CHOOSING NOT to call the police when things go bad.</p>
<p>So what? That&rsquo;s their choice and they&rsquo;re complaining about their choice and their supporters are whining because these immigrants&rsquo; have chosen to not to call the police. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. </p>

		<p>&#8220;He was walking with a friend&#8221;&hellip;<br>
I made a friend a couple of years back watching the Puerto Rican pride parade in Manhattan. It took all of about six minutes of standing there to realize I didn`t need to be, didn`t want to be and wasn`t gonna be hanging around when the crowds attention was shifted from the parade to the  fellow parade goers as it broke up. <br>
 Just as I started to walk off a woman touched me on the arm and asked if I thought it was safe for her and her fifteen year old daughter to be watching it alone. I replied, &#8220;Uhhh&hellip; In a word, no! Lady I`m 6&rsquo;2&#8221; 235 and slipping out the back door myself.&#8221; She then asked with urgent concern if I would walk with them IF I was going in their direction. &#8220;Which way ARE you going?&#8221;, she asked. &#8220;Toward your hotel and then my own&#8221;, I replied. The look of relief and gratitude was palpable on her face. Although I didn`t like the idea of &#8220;bait hanging off a sea anchor&#8221; slowing me down, I got her home without incident and pondered what triggered her fear response along with my own. Too much exuberence from the crowd or a feeling of standing next to a powder keg?&hellip;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s not being identified is who is committing these crimes. It doesn&rsquo;t say white or black.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t AR post an article recently about various hispanic ethnics attacking other hispanic ethnics?</p>

		<p>This is hilarious.  &#8220;Newcomers&#8221; present in the country illegally are afraid to call the police for assistance?  Imagine that  &mdash;  a criminal afraid to call the police.  Perhaps they can now better appreciate how whites feel walking through hispanic neighborhoods here in the United States.    </p>

		<p>I would wager that most of the increase of hate crimes in NYS where Hispanics are victims are coming at the hands of blacks or other minorities.  If Hispanic COMMITS a hate crime, though, it will be counted as white.</p>

		<p>As much as I&rsquo;d like to see 3d world immigration come to an end and even after all the unwarranted, unprovoked harassment and outright violence I&rsquo;ve been subjected to by black and, to a lesser extent, brown people, I hope they throw away the key when they convict the creeps doing this, and I&rsquo;d feel the same way if they were members of my own family, let alone ethnicity. </p>
<p>First and foremost it&rsquo;s just wrong to attack people based on race. Wrong and disgustingly cowardly. Secondly, however isolated these incidents may be, especially compared to the grossly disproportionate number of nonwhite on white attacks, this does nothing but give fuel to the SPLC and other Caucasian-haters false portrayal of Whites as horrible, racist monsters.</p>
<p>All my skepticism about hate-crime legislation aside, I hope the animals doing this rot in prison, period.</p>

<p>When they don&rsquo;t list the race of the perps, you know they are persons of color, however, I think &#8216;a national spotlight&rsquo; trumps the usual media shenanigans. In this case we can guess the race of the perps too. </p>

		<p>How many times a DAY are whites murdered by &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in the US? The case listed above garners attention because some of the perps are white ( I doubt Jose Pacheco, one of the gang, is white ) and because it&rsquo;s so rare for whites to attack non-whites based on race. Well, it&rsquo;s rare these days. As conditions deteriorate, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be so rare in the future. </p>

		<p>The Latinos can end their &#8220;climate of fear&#8221; simply by returning to the countries that they are legal citizens of.  This does not mean, though, that the actions of the teenage thugs was justified.  They are simply playing the role that Morris Dees wants them to play, and he and his organization will benefit from those actions far more than anyone else.  The SPLC and its liberal media allies will use this and similar incidents to argue against enforcing immigration law, when in fact cases like this wouldn&rsquo;t occur if we actually did enforce immigration law.<br>

		<p><i>What&rsquo;s not being identified is who is committing these crimes. It doesn&rsquo;t say white or black.</i></p>
<p>Usually, when the race of the perpetrator(s) of a hate crime is not mentioned, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re non-white. However, <i>The Washington Times</i> is one of the few relatively conservative papers in the country, so in this case, that may not be true. This could indeed be a &#8220;man bites dog&#8221; story, so to speak. </p>

		<p>A party by any other name would whither and die&hellip;.</p>
<p>And speaking of names, folks: why don&rsquo;t they just rename themselves the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; and be done with it. This is certainly not the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Is it the goal of these clowns that they destroy the GOP in order that it may be rebuilt in their hideous image? If that is the case they&rsquo;re in for more-than-a-few surprises. That silly party is already &#8220;in their image&#8221;. Are they serious when they imply that they wish to move it even further to the right? How &#8220;far right&#8221; can one move before one falls off of the face of the earth? Are they serious?</p>
<p>Watching the utter implosion of the Grand Old Party in the last year has been the gift that just keeps giving and giving. Someone pinch me!</p>

		<p>As a NY resident, I can say several of you are indeed on the right track. Virtually all of these recently reported incidents involved blacks and other Hispanics as the perpetrators. In one case there were white &#8220;youths&#8221; involved as well, but there were non-whites accused right along side. </p>
<p>Anyone who has ever had any real contact with &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; of varying ethnic groups knows well that they can&rsquo;t stand one another. They also know that nearly all Hispanics despise blacks, and blacks aren&rsquo;t all that fond of them either, especially in heavy gang-activity areas. Yes, yes, clearly &#8220;diversity is our strength!&#8221;</p>

		<p>When a nation is being invaded, is it wrong for citizens to wage guerrilla war against the invaders?  Is it wrong for Tibetans to harass the millions of Han Chinese, who are brought into their land in order to swamp them and subjugate them?  Was it wrong for Native Americans to take pot shots at white settlers who ignored treaties and stole their land?  On the contrary.  It&rsquo;s a duty for a race to look out for its genetic interest and right now, we&rsquo;re being invaded by those Latinos who &#8220;&hellip;said they had always been reluctant to contact police, fearing they would be asked about their immigration status&#8221;.  They are invaders and they are here to conquer us.  There is nothing wrong with defending our lands.  It is a duty.</p>
