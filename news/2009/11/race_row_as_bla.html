			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miles Goslett, Daily Mail (London), November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The makers of a hit Hollywood film are at the centre of a race controversy after removing two black actors from a poster being used to promote it in Britain.</p>
<p>The American advert for Couples Retreat, a comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Kristin Davis, show all eight principal actors  &mdash;  six of whom are white and two black.</p>
<p>But the poster in Britain, where the film is on general release, omits actors Faizon Love and Kali Hawk.</p>
<p>Couples Retreat, about four couples who go on holiday together and receive therapy to improve their relationships, has taken more than Â£70 million at the box office worldwide since it opened last month.</p>
<p>A spokesman for makers Universal Pictures confirmed the poster had been changed to &#8216;simplify&rsquo; it for the UK and international market outside America. The studio said it regretted causing offence and has abandoned plans to use the revised poster in other countries.</p>
<p>Mail on Sunday film critic Jason Solomons said: &#8216;We don&rsquo;t cater much for the black cinema-going audience in this country, which is a great shame, so it seems strange that when there are black stars in a major feature film this fact isn&rsquo;t promoted. And, in terms of business decisions, this seems a pretty counter-productive one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caspar Salmon, a 29-year-old translator from London who has seen the film, has complained to Universal. He said in a letter to the film company: &#8216;My hackles are up. I would like to ask what the thinking was behind this move to gaz-ump [Love and Hawk] from the promotional material.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, said: &#8216;I think this was an ill-conceived move. We celebrate diversity in Britain and we could have coped with seeing the same poster used in America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last month black British actress Thandie Newton spoke of racism in the film industry.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I&rsquo;ve experienced racism in Hollywood, but not as conflict or in a threatening way, just the ignorance of people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Universal spokesman said the revised advert aimed &#8216;to simplify the poster to actors who are most recognisable in international markets&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The real reason they&rsquo;re angry is that one of the cute blondes wasn&rsquo;t cast in an interracial couple.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just common sense that White people go to the movies to see White people in movies. People want to see people they can relate to.  How many White people do you think were sitting in seats in the theatre watching some piece of garbage like &#8220;Stomp the Yard&#8221;?  We won&rsquo;t go watch a film with a black lead, black co-star or a black sidekick.  I dare say the inclusion of this couple in the movie probably curtailed the box office sales.  It had a budget of 70 million and made 96 million in the US and Canada with total global revenue at 124 million.  In contrast, a movie like &#8220;300&#8221;, a film with an anti-diversity message (albeit a war propaganda film directed at Iran) with the same budget grossed 456 million.  </p>

<p>No, we don&rsquo;t.  We&rsquo;ve tolerated it for 50 odd years, and now we&rsquo;ve had enough.  Every day, more and more people are seeing the light.</p>

		<p>That black couple really sticks out in the unaltered poster.  The black man&rsquo;s gross obesity coupled with the overall unattractiveness of the couple is a big turn off.  Having said that, the White couples don&rsquo;t exactly look like movie posters from the 1970s.  Film stars in movies used to be well dressed, have a clean sharp look and well defined features.  These people are wearing sloppy ugly fashions and it looks like they slept in them on a bench at the airport.  The trend in Hollywood appears to me to be casting the most plain average or below average looking Whites (especially men) in films so they don&rsquo;t stand out against their black co-stars.    </p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s Hollywood&rsquo;s answer to the Naval Academy decision.  How about when they tried to diversify the 9/11 Firemen&rsquo;s monument.  This nation is one big joke that isn&rsquo;t humorous in the least bit.<br>

		<p>One of my big three eye opening moments was when I went to a White &#8220;Supremicist&#8221; web site for laughs. Under  the ten commandments or such was a maxim that said, &#8220;As a distinct cultural group Whites have the absolute right to transmit their heritage through stories of any medium without the mandatory inclusion of minorities.&#8221; Ouch! Wham! Bingo! I remember thinking they`re not only not stupid, they`re just about right! </p>

		<p>It reminds of when &#8220;Dreamgirls&#8221; opened on Broadway back in the 19(80s?.) The show (and subsequent film) is a dramatization of a &#8220;Supremes-Like&#8221; Black Girl Trio in the early days of Mo-Town. </p>
<p>The producers didn&rsquo;t want to turn off White audiences (as if there is any other of Broadway audience) so the poster showed the three girls from just the waist down&hellip;.and then lightened up the legs so that their race wasn&rsquo;t apparent. </p>
<p>I found it interesting that actors Faizon Love and Kali Hawk weren&rsquo;t among those raising a ruckus about their omission from the &#8220;Couples Retreat&#8221; poster. As actors, they probably have some sort of participation agreement with the producers, so it&rsquo;s in their interest to have the film marketed in whatever way will sell the most tickets in the various overseas markets it&rsquo;s showing. </p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m a little surprised that there wasn&rsquo;t an outcry when the American poster came out and had the Black couple standing about a time zone behind Vince Vaughn and Kristin Davis.</p>

I think the British elite have really deluded themselves by trying to speak for everyone like some sort of communist regime.<br>
Anyway it was a really bad movie so don&rsquo;t waste your hard earned money on this hollywood garbage.</p>

		<p>This seems to me like a sneaky way for them to promote a film in Britain by hiding the fact that its demographics are 25% black, compared to those of Britain which are less than 5% black.</p>
<p>Then the professional blacks whine about the company&rsquo;s deception, which was designed to sucker white Brits into theaters to watch blacks.  Too stupid not to bite the hand that feeds them I guess.</p>

		<p>Albert, I agree with your statement about the British elites.  And I think I understand their attitudes (although I certainly don&rsquo;t share them).  </p>
<p>Many Southerners in the Norse/Semitic &#8220;elite&#8221; classes grew up bullied and abused by children (and adult &#8216;authority figures&rsquo;) of Celtic and Slavic descent, while being pampered and adored by black servants.  That&rsquo;s pretty much how it has been for the British elites, too.  Obviously, their world view has little to do with the real world.  But that&rsquo;s how THEIR lives have played so far: resentful pink-skinned underlings, contrasted with solicitous black and brown caretakers (not just cooks and nannies, but also waiters, hotel maids&hellip;).  </p>
<p>Of COURSE the caretakers are solicitous!  They&rsquo;re being paid for it.  I have a beautiful blonde cousin, who has been a princess from birth: private jet, multiple homes&hellip; you know the drill. When her parents fled Mississippi, they brought their black servants with them, and those carefully chosen blacks lavished love upon my cousin.</p>
<p>But she grew up in a small town where she was resented (and probably abused) by the poor whites.  We were at a family gathering in the Intermountain West, and she was complaining about all the pink-skinned &#8216;Rednecks&rsquo;.  &#8220;You know, I just love blacks, like (list of family retainers), but I absolutely hate WHITE TRASH!&#8221;  </p>
<p>This princess, who grew up behind a nine-foot wall (when not at their beach house on a gated Island), has not had to interact with &#8216;minorities&rsquo; in the ways most of us have.  They staff her father&rsquo;s businesses and make her rich, instead of wiping out the equity of her home, or keeping her awake at night with their boom-cars.  And I&rsquo;m sure the rest of the Western World&rsquo;s &#8216;elites&rsquo; see the world from pretty much the same privileged vantage point that my Cousin does.</p>
<p>They have no idea what it&rsquo;s like to have to interact with non-whites as equals.<br>

		<p>I have been told by people in the film industry that there is a quota system in place in Hollywood, and that it is impossible to make a movie in the U.S. without hiring the required percentage  of blacks. Blacks comprise about 12 percent of the population but they seem to have a deal with the film production companies to have a much larger percentage portrayed in movies today. Try watching the movie 2012 for an example of how this works. </p>
