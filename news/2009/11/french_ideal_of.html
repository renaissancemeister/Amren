<p>Residents here [Vélib&rsquo;, Paris&rsquo;s bicycle rental system] can rent a sturdy bicycle from hundreds of public stations and pedal to their destinations, an inexpensive, healthy and low-carbon alternative to hopping in a car or bus.</p>
<p>{snip} Many of the specially designed bikes, which cost $3,500 each, are showing up on black markets in Eastern Europe and northern Africa. Many others are being spirited away for urban joy rides, then ditched by roadsides, their wheels bent and tires stripped.</p>
<p>With 80 percent of the initial 20,600 bicycles stolen or damaged, the program&rsquo;s organizers have had to hire several hundred people just to fix them. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bruno Marzloff, a sociologist who specializes in transportation, said, &#8220;One must relate this to other incivilities, and especially the burning of cars,&#8221; referring to gangs of immigrant youths burning cars during riots in the suburbs in 2005.</p>
<p>He said he believed there was social revolt behind Vélib&rsquo; vandalism, especially for suburban residents, many of them poor immigrants who feel excluded from the glamorous side of Paris.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an outcry, a form of rebellion; this violence is not gratuitous,&#8221; Mr. Marzloff said. {snip}</p>

<p>This is on par with the belief system of the new immigrant. They seem to believe that simply crossing the border entitles them to the status and standards of the people who built the nation.</p>
<p>Some people in Buffalo started a similar program downtown. They put in bike stands with bikes locked down for rent. Within weeks, they bikes were stolen or stripped.</p>
<p>The bike stands have been removed. That was the end of that venture.</p>

		<p>So, according to the original article, the immigrants &#8220;feel excluded from the glamorous side of Paris&#8221;?</p>
<p>How can this be? I went there in April and I was not excluded from anything. You can go anywhere, see anything, if you have the money to pay for it. What is so difficult about that?</p>
<p>I read this article in my newspaper, on Sunday. The quote from Marzloff, of course, was not in it. But I wondered &hellip; could it be the same culprits?</p>
<p>Bien sur.</p>

<p>These people are hopeless.  I never knew there was a &#8220;right&#8221; to mobility, and that its &#8220;denial&#8221; was justification for vandalism.  But in France, who knows? Just goes to show that it&rsquo;s not only American sociologists who are buffoons. </p>

		<p>When visiting a small city in Switerland,  I was amazed to see the rows of bicycles left unattended, unlocked, outside the local train station.</p>
<p>But that  was nothing compared to the baby carriages  (with babies!) left outide stores as their mothers went inside to shop.  There  would be a bunch of them!  This is how it is when you have a  close-knit community where everyone trusts and cares about everyone else.   Obviously, the immigrant invation hasn&rsquo;t gotten there yet!  You would never see this in Los Angeles or New York. </p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t know why Amren even posts articles from the Times. </p>
<p>Their multiracialist propaganda has become so superficial and formulaic it&rsquo;s embarrassing to even look at.</p>
<p>1) Journalist decribes problem.</p>
<p>2) Journalist has &#8220;expert&#8221; give leftist explanation for why problem is happening. </p>
<p>3) Journalist comforts readers with the &#8220;fact&#8221; that it&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s racist neanderthals (the toxic Other) who are the problem.</p>

<p>Hmmm,&hellip;this raises an interesting question: are the &#8220;immigrant youths&#8221; rebellious because they are excluded from the glamorous side of Paris, or are they excluded from the glamorous side of Paris because of their anti-social attitude (among other things)?</p>

<p>I recently finished a book on the history of public housing in New York, and there were comparable figures for the damage done to the elevators and common spaces in the buildings by the tenants   &mdash;   huge numbers of staff working around the clock were required to keep things functional.  To some extent I believe this is a problem with common goods in a large, diverse society in general, but like many problems it sadly seems to be exacerbated when a black population is added to the mix.</p>

*delicate cough*<br>
Question: Why did they have to use $3,500 bicycles, why not $350 bicycles?<br>
Answer: because it&rsquo;s a government program.</p>
<p>As for theft<br>
In Japan some people don&rsquo;t even bother to secure their bicycles with locks. Amazing huh?</p>

<p>   This is another good indication of the benefits of liberal diversity. Such a system of bike rental could work in Iceland or Japan but not in multicultural France. Maybe, in the France of 1950 it would have worked. The &#8220;poor immigrants&#8221; don&rsquo;t feel part of the French nation and never will. </p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
I went to Paris with nothing but the shabby, tattered, Yankee dollar to spend, and not being super-rich, I didn&rsquo;t get to see much of the glamourous side either, except from outside looking in. I didn&rsquo;t feel discriminated against; I was just a poor American tourist with depreciated American dollars. I had to make do.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t go and steal some bicycles. Or want to &#8220;revolt&#8221;. According to Mr. Marzloff, maybe I should have!  And what on earth is a $3,500. bicycle?  I never heard of such a thing.  Are these motor bikes?  Obviously, they must be the best of the best!  Nothing but the best will do for these &#8220;suburban youfs&#8221;.  Anything less, and they&rsquo;d feel discriminated against. Heaven forbid!  They might be &#8220;offended.&#8221;  [another leftist buzz word]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see how economic disparities are now being turned into issues of &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;  Is this the direction the communists are now taking?  Obviously, the fight against &#8220;discrimination&#8221; has paid off handsomely elsewhere, so the leftists are jumping on the bandwagon and going with a proven winner.</p>

There was a sensational case like that several years ago in NY City.  A young Danish couple left their baby (in carriage) outside a restaurant (where they could observe it through the window).   They were arrested for Child Neglect, or some such offense.  There was a big fuss in the newspapers and many Europeans came to their defense, insisting that this was a perfectly ordinary custom in Europe. </p>
<p>Well, maybe in Denmark, but not in New York!</p>
