<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33893470/ns/health-sexual_health/">Genetic Love Match? Dating Sites Try DNA Tests</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some genetic testing companies are promising to match couples based on the DNA testing, touting the benefits of biological compatibility.</p>
<p>The companies claim that a better biological match will mean better sex, less cheating, longer-lasting love and perhaps even healthier children.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many dating services can you think of where they can suggest you might have better children?&#8221; said Eric Holzle, founder of ScientificMatch.com, one of the first online dating sites to use DNA.</p>
<p>Holzle wouldn&rsquo;t reveal membership numbers, but GenePartner, a Swiss company that works with matchmakers and dating sites, has tested more than 1,000 people, according to chief scientific officer Tamara Brown. Some were already coupled and took the test out of curiosity.</p>
<p>The GenePartner Test is $99, and will be offered at the dating site sense2love.com when it relaunches next month.</p>
<p>The idea is that people tend to be attracted to those who have immune system genes that are dissimilar from their own.</p>
<p>Biologists say the HLA genes of the immune system  &mdash;  which are responsible for recognizing and marking foreign cells such as viruses so other parts of the immune system can attack them  &mdash;  also determine body odor &#8220;fingerprints.&#8221; And people tend to be attracted to the natural body odors of those who have different HLA genes from their own.</p>
<p>In one study, Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind found that women who were not taking hormonal contraception preferred the natural scent of men whose immune systems were the most different from theirs.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Ridiculous&rsquo; idea, expert says</b></p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t put too much faith in this, experts said.</p>
<p>Dr. Rocio Moran, medical director of the General Genetics Clinic at the Cleveland Clinic, called the idea &#8220;ridiculous,&#8221; and said the science of attraction is too complex to look at only a few genes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When a random sample of married people was studied, their immune systems were not that different, said Patrick Markey, associate professor of psychology at Villanova. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rachel Herz, author of &#8220;The Scent of Desire,&#8221; who teaches olfaction and human behavior at Brown, believes the science is legit but thinks prospective matches should swap T-shirts and sniff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holzle was not able to point to any success stories. He said his site tends to attract people who are concerned about privacy and has not done a good job tracking members once they leave. GenePartner did not respond to a request to speak to its customers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Singles who sign up for ScientificMatch.com get a welcome box in the mail containing a skin cells-swab kit. The person mails the kit to the lab, with results in approximately two weeks, then uploads a profile and photos and takes a personal values test. The site also conducts a background check.</p>
<p>Matches are generated based on the DNA, values and preferences.</p>

		<p>What they basically seem to be saying is, the more a suitor diverges from you, the better the match. Race-mixing is now based on &#8216;proven science&rsquo;. Of course this opens the door to debate on the issue and to the &#8216;science&rsquo; saying the opposite, so we should encourage this development?</p>

		<p>That is interesting. Other studies show people are most attracted to those with similar facial structures, which would of course often imply similar ethnic backgrounds.</p>

<p>So after they tell us there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, we&rsquo;re all the same race - the idea of race is a social construct (and by the way &#8216;white&rsquo; folks are all oppressors) next they are going to tell us there is greater similarity in regards to the immune system between races than within them, and that we need greater racial diversity in the gene pool.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nothing new about this - I heard it long ago that different and complementary immune systems seem to encourage the formation of couples.<br>
It&rsquo;s logical because immune systems need to be diverse in order to counter a wide range of diseases.<br>
However it doesn&rsquo;t entail that racial diversity is necessary. I assume that within your own race there&rsquo;s all the immunological diversity you need to survive your native environment.</p>
<p>Besides this seems to be the only trait in which diversity is good. When it comes to the overwhelming majority of other traits, it is similarity that is good for mating, not diversity. And the other traits are related to genetics as well.</p>

		<p>The theory of people being attracted to those with genetically foreign immune systems seems to challenge the laws of natural selection and process of evolution.</p>
<p>Consider the Delta-32 allele for example.  This &ldquo;mutation&rdquo; of the human immune system renders a recipient highly resistant or virtually immune to the world&rsquo;s deadliest pathogens, including small pox, plaque and HIV.   In the homogeneous incident (only one of two genetic markers) a recipient is resistant, having only one docking port for the pathogens to attach to.  In the heterogeneous incident (both genetic markers) no docking port on the host cell exists.  </p>
<p>The Delta-32 allele is common to the White race and occurs in alternative races only through admixture.  Because it is a rare and recessive gene (About 10 percent of White people have at least one marker.) it would quickly be lost if carriers  bred with those who did not carry the gene.  <br>

<p>Yes I also heard/read that the worst smell recorded by most adolescent females was that of their own fathers.<br>
A biological indicator that this would be a bad mix in terms of creating a less diverse immune system in your offspring.</p>
<p><br>
But I agree that you don&rsquo;t have to go back into the jungle to find diversity.<br>
One of my White parents was raised in the Northern hemisphere and the other in the Southern.<br>
And technically I&rsquo;m a bit of mongrel(like most Whites I know), in that I have a few White strains in me.<br>
But yet the family resemblance remains.<br>
Eg. my son is a clone of his maternal grandfather and my daughter is a clone of her paternal grandmother.<br>
Genes are wacky hey.</p>
<p>Physical strength and/or health is surely important, but there are other inheritable attributes that are also at least as important, our bodies are just the vehicles (or container) for our minds after all. <br>

<p>Well, yes, there is a painfully clear agenda.  The Powers That Be, are pulling out every imagineable stop to encourage race-mixing so that the White gene, which is most naturally and fiercely resistent to poisonous ideas such as unitarianism, communism, egalitariansim, etc. is completely eradicated in a tsunami of miscegenation.  Simply put, the pure White gene is the last obstacle to a one-world government.  Mark my words, it will continue with &#8220;harmony legislation&#8221;  &mdash;  tax incentives for interracial couples (specifically the white female/non-white male variety) while stiff fines are imposed on White couples who choose to marry.  Even White children will be segregated by gender in schools to keep them from even socializing with one another.  Eventually it will be illegal for a White man and a White woman to marry and have children.  That&rsquo;s the agenda.  Our extinction.<br>

		<p>You people don&rsquo;t seem to understand that these particular genetic differences aren&rsquo;t related to race.  People of different races tend to despise eachother for purposes of mating.  People of the SAME race but different clan, tend to be complimentary.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the studies done on this had exactly zero variation of race.  Why?  Because they were all done on young college students&hellip;..in other words, white people.</p>
