			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phillip Martin, Global Post (Boston), November 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Asians like white skin,&#8221; said Dr. Hsieh Ya Ju, a dermatologist at MacKay Memorial Hospital in Hsingchu, who sees about 25 patients a day. Outside Hsieh&rsquo;s office, four middle-aged chalky-skinned women sat patiently awaiting treatments that cost $300 to $500 per session. They are there to take pills that Hsieh says will help their skin turn white. Doctors in Taiwan also use lasers, creams, surgeries and other means to lighten skin.</p>
<p>Nydia Lin, a senior executive in Taiwan for Japanese cosmetics giant Shisedo, said as many as 50 percent of Taiwanese women (and growing numbers of men) are paying big money to medically alter their golden exteriors. &#8220;We promote the idea of whitening. Especially in Taiwan we see many beautiful idols on TV and they are all focused on their whitening skin. As the Chinese say, &#8216;You can cover all your defective parts if you are white.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Variations of that slogan are heard throughout Asia, with the most common translation being, &#8220;One white can cover up three ugliness.&#8221; According to a 2004 study by global marketing firm Synovate, nearly 40 percent of women in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines used skin whitening and lightening products that year.</p>
<p>Asian skin whitening has a tradition that stretches back centuries. &#8220;The feminine ideal during the Han period for women of the court was almost unearthly white, white skin. Moon-like roundish faces, long black hair. You can see how a culture that maintained that as an early ideal might continue with an ideal that light skin equals beauty,&#8221; said Anne Rose Kitagawa, assistant curator of Japanese art at Harvard&rsquo;s Sackler Museum.</p>
<p>Asia&rsquo;s obsession with whiteness is also a reflection of economic status. &#8220;Those who had skin burnt by the sun were working in the fields, therefore, the whitening of the skin was a reflection of labor status,&#8221; said University of Houston historian Gerald Horne.</p>
<p>Horne also points to a political angle, shaped by the Allies&rsquo; victory in World War II. &#8220;An aspiration of many in Asia toward whiteness is a reflection of the idea that the North Atlantic Powers were the quote  &mdash;  winners  &mdash;  unquote, and therefore they need to be imitated.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Chao-uan Tsen, of the Taipei womens&rsquo; rights organization Awakening Foundation, said the whitening trend is a form of self hatred. {snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, there are medical downsides to seeking lighter skin. That&rsquo;s especially true for those who can&rsquo;t afford expensive treatments, such as poor women using illegal bleaches and creams containing mercuric chloride that have left them disfigured.</p>
<p>Skin whitening can be dangerous for other reasons too, including the loss of melanin. {snip}</p>
<p>Medical concerns aside, Taiwanese student Hilda Chu views skin whitening as a practical response to society&rsquo;s pressures: &#8220;My future employers like white skin more,&#8221; she says simply.<br>

		<p>Nice to NOT read that this is the fault of Western &#8220;cultural imperialism&#8221;! The alabaster complexion had been desirable in Asia since the early centuries BC. What&rsquo;s up with the Japanese tradition of black teeth? That always mystified this foreign devil. The traditional courtesans and geishas had white face paint, red lips, and black stained teeth. If this was still the fashion I would start a business in Asia selling black jellybeans as an easy way to stain teeth ;). </p>
<p>When I was travelling in the Philippines I noticed salons that advertised &#8216;armpit whitening&rsquo; and I saw a product in a pharmacy to make nipples pink. It is also striking that the native celebrities are quite pale compared with the general populace. Have a look at Jenn Mercado for example. She looks have Spanish. </p>

<p>&gt;Asians, Chinese in particular are noted for supporting such things as Rhino depopulation and Shark fin harvesting simply because they believe the shape of the objects hold some power for enhancing the libido.  How far is the desire for white skin going to go?</p>
<p>&#8220;Skin whitening can be dangerous for other reasons too, including the loss of melanin. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Since when is melanin a health determiner?  The people who have less of it do far better in northern, darker climates than those who have &#8220;too much.&#8221;  As long as you don&rsquo;t stray too far from where your race evolved, you have optimum melanin.  And for whites going south, they can cover up, while those with more melanin have a more difficult time finding adequate UV.</p>

		<p>Actually I think many Asian women are attractive, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that, although their skin isn&rsquo;t white it IS pretty light in many of them, especially Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>But whether they have light skin or tan, I think is a small matter.  Michelle Malkin is extremely attractive and she has a tan complexion.</p>

		<p>Yes, Asians like white skin - but not the white peoples white skin.</p>
<p>Fact is Asian women, regardless of complexion, have more beautiful smooth skin compared with white women - and everyone is aware of this - white men too unfortunately.</p>
<p>The thing about white women&rsquo;s skin is it is simply not &#8216;waat&rsquo; (smooth and blemish free) like Chinese women&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>So yes, they go for the light complexion, but are in no way envious of Caucasian skin at all.</p>
<p>One drawback, I think, to Asian skin is it scars more easily than Caucasian skin. </p>
<p>But aesthetically, on <i>average</i>, I prefer Asian complexions to white complexions.</p>

		<p>Asians are obsessed with Caucasoid features. Skin lighters are very popular among Indian men, an Amren article stated it a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Ainu people in Japan are known for their strong beard growth and mixed colored eyes. Even Ainu women have mustache tattoos over their lips.</p>

		<p>As I have posted elsewhere, it is quite normal, and universal, to regard &#8220;fair&#8221; (light-complected) women as &#8220;fair&#8221; (beautiful).</p>
<p>I remember seeing a TV program many years ago about an investigation into beauty.  The objective was to determine whether there were  objective, or at any rate inherent standards of beauty. The method used was to study infants and their reactions to strangers, noting where the infants looked, for how long, and other behaviours denoting attraction or avoidance.</p>
<p>The investigators found a number of characteristics that were regarded as attractive to infants of all races (therefore not learned). These included light skin, heart-shaped face, wide-set eyes among others.  Of course, such a study would be impossible today - racist, sexist, probably heteronormative or homophobic, and definitely hate-filled (don&rsquo;t ask me, I don&rsquo;t make the rules).</p>

&#8220;Yes, Asians like white skin - but not the white peoples white skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt that you can speak for all Asians.  In fact, your biases are so plain to see I doubt there is anything that you have ever written on here that doesn&rsquo;t reek of bias, prejudice and bigotry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact is Asian women, regardless of complexion, have more beautiful smooth skin compared with white women - and everyone is aware of this - white men too unfortunately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re speaking for white men, when you can&rsquo;t accurately describe what your own people prefer.  The fact is that a &#8220;FEW&#8221; Asian women are attractive, but the men are small and wimpish-looking and unattractive.  While an American male might be attracted to a few Asian females I&rsquo;ve never known a white female to be attracted to an Asian male.  I can concede, however, there might be a few cases, but not many.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing about white women&rsquo;s skin is it is simply not &lsquo;waat&rsquo; (smooth and blemish free) like Chinese women&rsquo;s skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dumbest observation you&rsquo;ve made so far.  There are millions of beautiful white women who are blemish-free, more so than any other race.  White women are known globally by all races to be the prettiest women on the planet.  You will not admit it, because white women just don&rsquo;t like Asian men.</p>
<p>&#8220;So yes, they go for the light complexion, but are in no way envious of Caucasian skin at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t?  That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  If whites weren&rsquo;t a model for them, they would be darkening their complexions with sun lamps instead of lightening their skin.   Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve seen photos of Asians, next to whites, whose skin can&rsquo;t be distinguished from whites in the phonto.  The only way to tell who might be Asian is to look at the faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;One drawback, I think, to Asian skin is it scars more easily than Caucasian skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>How on earth do you know that?  Quite a silly statement unless you&rsquo;re a trainer for white and Asian female boxers. </p>
<p>&#8220;But aesthetically, on average, I prefer Asian complexions to white complexions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then what on earth are you doing in our country?  Your posts indicate someone who dislikes whites, yet you packed up and made quite an effort to come here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very typical to have foreign malcontents in this country, comprised of alien races, who dispise whites and hold animosity towards them, and they come here specifically because their own country and people are unable to build a similar society.  Yet the first thing they want us to know is that they don&rsquo;t like us and they think their race is superior.  Quite frankly, they&rsquo;re too dense to see the contradiction in their statements, actions, and their views.</p>
<p>The most convincing evidence possible that whites are superior in every way is that millions of non-whites rush to our land and want to weasel their way into our society.  They&rsquo;re humble and contrite at first, but eventually, like you, they begin beating the drums of superiority and crowing about how great the countries are they fled from, while they reveal that they really disliked us all along.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy, why don&rsquo;t you go home?  Your country is a mess.  It needs you to try to bring about change there&hellip;.not here.<br>

		<p>  I live in a small college town . The Japanese students here are tall, fair complected,black hair and the eyefold is almost un-noticeable . I used to study WW2 history voraciously . These do not look like the same people from those 30s and 40s photographs . I have no explanation or theory and remain somewhat perplexed by it all . Except my wife who is 1/68 Cherokee is as fair as I am unless she gets out in the sun . Then she turns very dark, very quickly .</p>

		<p>Surely, it is sad if God create people through His image but we prefer to be something else. But my arguement might be wrong. </p>
<p>Because it can be that they are just enhancing their God given beauty and it has nothing to do with being trying to be white or loving white skill.</p>
<p>In most cases Amren views are twisted in order to promote one line of thinking and indoctrinate those who are weak to think for themselves.They agenda or line of thinking is that of white racist. Anything which is not white is inferior. </p>
<p>For istance ther was this Nigerian soccer player who can&rsquo;t manage his finance.Of course, it sad and wrong for any person not to manage his or her finances.

<p>Everything else you said in your post is a matter of opinion.  However, this defies common sense.  If the typical AR poster were &#8220;weak thinking,&#8221; as you might put it, and &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t think for him or her self,&#8221; again as you might put it, then they&rsquo;d believe in racial equality and diversity.  For that&rsquo;s the viewpoint being pushed by the powers that be day in and day out, for about two generations plus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the whole reason why I use Question Diversity as my screen name.  I saw a hippie car with the bumper stickers &#8220;Question Authority&#8221; and &#8220;Honor Diversity&#8221; (and many others).  The goofy part about whoever owns that car, (among many other things) is that all the &#8220;authorities&#8221; believe in &#8220;diversity,&#8221; so questioning diversity IS questioning authority.</p>

<p>Yes, sure.  And because the entire world dresses with Western suits ties and dresses isn&rsquo;t proof that they copy the West either is it?</p>
<p>&#8220;In most cases Amren views are twisted in order to promote one line of thinking and indoctrinate those who are weak to think for themselves.They (sic) agenda or line of thinking is that of white racist. Anything which is not white is inferior.&#8221;</p>
<p>The weakest, lowest intellects on here are the ones who post silly points of view that are unintelligent and just plain ignorant. They are products of propagandizing by politically correct brainwashing criminals, but they&rsquo;re not intelligent enough to see it.  They think it is the objective, independent thinking white nationalist, who refuses to be so gullible and unintelligent to accept politically correct drivel, as the one who has been duped into accepting an ideology, but it is themselves who are so gullible and ignorant who have accepted corruption and lies, which are the entire basis of political correctness. </p>
<p>&#8220;For istance ther was this Nigerian soccer player who can&rsquo;t manage his finance.Of course, it sad and wrong for any person not to manage his or her finances. It does not matter whether you&rsquo;re black or white. To the AMREN viewers this is a black maen problem all white are managing their finances. Please forgive those kids you&rsquo;re trying to indoctrinate with this junk.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the Amren members this black is typical of MOST ALL blacks that&rsquo;s why his inabilities are highlighted. Surely you&rsquo;re not too unintelligent to recognize that.  Blacks have an average group I.Q. in this country of 85, and only 70 in Africa.  Attempts are made by the PC crowd to cover those facts up.  We give examples of lack of black intellect to reveal the lies of political correctness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lies hurt big time.&#8221;</p>
<p>They do.  That&rsquo;s why the lies of political correctness have deteriorated this empire to a point of eminent collapse.  Only the most gullible and the least intelligent are unable too see this.  To the free thinking, objective intellects, it is more than clear.  You accept lies, but you are unaware of it.  That&rsquo;s truly sad.  It is possible you don&rsquo;t know the truth, because you can&rsquo;t understand it when it is revealed, and prefer to base your opinions on propaganda that you have been inundated with.</p>
<p>Please educate yourself before posting again.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to your observations- #1 Better nutrition in post-war Japan and #2 Western dentistry. The WW2 era Japanese peasants were lampooned by the Allies as buck-toothed yellow dwarfs. What was the average height of a Japanese soldier? Maybe 5&rsquo;3&#8221;? A typical American G.I. averaged at least 5&#8221; taller, and Australians were commonly over 6&rsquo;. During the U.S. occupation the G.I. introduced many dairy products and a larger meat consumption to the traditional Japanese diet. </p>
<p>Another factor is that the Japanese students who appear in our universities might often be from a more affluent segment of society. More affluent people tend to look better than the lower orders. </p>

		<p>Ranger, JOhn liu is correct that the asians have something smoother or better about their skin texture on the average compared to white women.</p>
<p>White women might be prettier on average, if we somehow had some vote of all the men, but if it is true, it is due to the facial feature shapes.</p>
<p>The prettiest women on the planet are probably white eastern europeans.</p>
<p>Asian women might have a higher percentage who are moderately hot though.</p>
<p>These are all my guesses, I have not done any real research.</p>

I believe M. Liu has said he&rsquo;s living in HongKong.  But apparently he was born here and is probably a citizen    &mdash;   or at least he was raised and educated here.  His English is much too natural and comfortable for a foreigner raised abroad.</p>
<p>As for Asians trying to imitate Europeans:  Asians favored light complexion and were trying to &#8220;look white&#8221; long before they came in contact with Europeans, so this seems to be a natural thing, and not an &#8220;imitation&#8221; of anybody else.</p>
<p>If white somen get their hair curled, they are not trying to imitate Africans. Or if they get it straightened, they are not imitating Asians. They are just trying to look nice in their own way.</p>

		<p>There is also a difference between dark skin, Asians etc, and Afro black skin. The former has very light smell even without great maintenance, but the latter has a very sharp stinking smell even if you would wash it with acids. Fact of God&rsquo;s accomplishment. As for Asians they believe that white is the color of Light and attractiveness and dark may not carry the same attributes. Though it does not really denotes internal character. But as for Africans it really denotes evil in every sense. Black is Black and Paints don&rsquo;t work much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just giving my honest opinion as an Asian man. The fact is most Asian men find Asian women more attractive than white women? That is a fact. But of course some Asian men will desire a white woman as a status symbol - I&rsquo;m not denying that.</p>
<p>And the fact is, on average, Asian skin is smoother and more blemish free than white caucasoid skin - which is comparitively rough. Asian women also do not need to shave their legs.</p>
<p>Why are you so offended that Asians may find their own women more attractive than white women? Is that not what WN want?</p>
<p>Afterall if black men found black women more attractive than white women (most of them probably do anyway), surely that would make most whites here (the men at least) very happy?</p>

<p>No you are the one being silly. Its a simple medical fact - one that is obviously not a good thing for Asians.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In most cases Amren views are twisted in order to promote one line of thinking and indoctrinate those who are weak to think for themselves.They agenda or line of thinking is that of white racist. Anything which is not white is inferior.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are not white you would not understand why we even have this website.  For all of my life the media, the government, the educators, blacks and pathetic whites have said that whites must give up their racist culture and submit to other races or miscegnate for a new world order.  I would rather die than give in to that.</p>

&#8220;Ranger, JOhn liu is correct that the asians have something smoother or better about their skin texture on the average compared to white women.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s preposterous and you know it.  </p>
<p>&#8220;White women might be prettier on average, if we somehow had some vote of all the men, but if it is true, it is due to the facial feature shapes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is true about all their attributes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prettiest women on the planet are probably white eastern europeans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asian women might have a higher percentage who are moderately hot though.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Ranger, I live in Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good.  Please stay where you are.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, why on earth are you on a White Nationalist web site from another country?  Don&rsquo;t you have any forums of your own?  I don&rsquo;t mind exchanging ideas with non-whites if they want to debate an issue or concept, but I&rsquo;m not going to allow my race to be insulted without fighting back. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m just giving my honest opinion as an Asian man. The fact is most Asian men find Asian women more attractive than white women? That is a fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;But of course some Asian men will desire a white woman as a status symbol - I&rsquo;m not denying that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not denying that, but do you realize you just contradicted yourself?  Why would Asian men want a white woman as a STATUS SYMBOL if they are not considered the cream of the crop so to speak?  I mean, a status symbol regarding humans means they are the best of the lot.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the fact is, on average, Asian skin is smoother and more blemish free than white caucasoid skin - which is comparitively rough. Asian women also do not need to shave their legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither do Asian men.  And that means exactly what?  If you live in Hong Kong you don&rsquo;t really get a true representation of white women I imagine, and I doubt that you get very close to the ones that are there, since most don&rsquo;t really like Asian males.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so offended that Asians may find their own women more attractive than white women? Is that not what WN want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it rather dense to go on the web site of another race and pound your chest about having women that are better than the race represented on the forum?  You don&rsquo;t understand that or you wouldn&rsquo;t do it, unless you wanted to purposely insult the people as a group, especially their women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterall if black men found black women more attractive than white women (most of them probably do anyway), surely that would make most whites here (the men at least) very happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it would&hellip;UNLESS&hellip;they came on here and boasted about how much greater their women were than ours.  Then they would get hammered.</p>
<p>And, incidentally,  black men DO NOT think that their women are more attractive, most likely because they&rsquo;re not, and neither are the men, and they&rsquo;re forced to mostly form relationships with their own kind.  Given a chance most black men will marry outside their race.  And, it isn&rsquo;t all about physical attractiveness.  A lot of it has to do with personality and intelligence. </p>
<p>YOu know, let me just say that you sound as if you are not a bad sort, just seriously naive about whites in general&hellip;.and blacks as well&hellip;.but you have to understand that whites in this country are having their traditions, culture, language, history and heroes under attack mostly by a group of whites who are mentally ill.  They have secured most of the organs of communications, and their desire is to eliminate any trace of whiteness off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Along with these mentally disturbed whites are other people who are jealous of our accomplishments and our competence, and they too try to harm us.  I&rsquo;m referring to mostly Hispanics and blacks.  They could NEVER build such an advanced society themselves and see our predicament as an opportunity to take over, which they are trying to do.  In plain language they want to steal our country and pretend it is they who made it what it is today.  We intend to fight them to the end or until we are victorious.</p>
<p>Surely you are aware of the problems China has had with blacks there who are into the same crimes as they are here, drugs, robbery, rape, and muggings, because the authorities are watching them closely now at all times and they tried to keep them out of sight during the olympics.  The whole world has the same problems with blacks, not just the US.</p>
<p>Here is the link to a Chinese-American woman who will tell her story about the experiences Chinese in this country have with blacks.  Her name is Ying ma.</p>

		<p>The comment was made above that Asian women age more gracefully than white women; I can suggest a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>1.  Tanning in the sun has been shunned by Asian women for many centuries, as a tan complexion has long been considered to be a trait of rural peasant women.  Broad-brimmed hats (for keeping the sun off their faces) are common.  For an example of what exposure to lots and lots of harsh sunlight does to the skin of Asiatic women, a look at the faces of middle-aged Amerindian, Inuit, Mongol and Chukchi women is informative.<br>
2.  Traditional Asian diets are rich in antioxidants.  Antioxidants in food help neutralize the free-radicals the UV in sunlight creates in persons exposed to it, reducing the damage these free-radicals do.<br>
3.  Fewer of them smoke.  While cigarette consumption in east Asia is enormous, there is a much stronger sexual bias among the users - who overwhelmingly tend to be men - than in the West.  Smoking helps destroy the collagen in skin, making it rougher and less flexible.<br>
4.  Ditto for use of hard drugs.  <br>
5.  Obesity is less common.</p>
<p>As an aside, I must ask in response to Eddie Sibya, who exactly is he suggesting is &#8220;twisting&#8221; my views &#8220;to promote one line of thinking&#8221;?  When I read comments I have posted earlier, they are here unedited.  No &#8220;twisting&#8221; appears necessary.<br>

<p>They are what the are in the eye of the beholder. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not saying it is a good thing they are status symbols - the fact that they can be shows not their greater level of attractiveness per se, but the power of colonial, and post-colonial brainwashing.</p>
<p>That is in fact why so many Asian sell-out women prefer to date white men - not because they in fact like them more physically, or feel more comfortable with them, but simply because they carry status - due to Western dominance, both historical and current.</p>
<p>Of course all this is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Interestingly in the Russian Far East - things are different. Russian women marry Chinese men, but rarely Chinese women Russian men. Women tend to marry economically, in relatively poor countries, even more so. Just as men marry for looks.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;White women might be prettier on average, if we somehow had some vote of all the men, but if it is true, it is due to the facial feature shapes&hellip;&hellip;Asian women might have a higher percentage who are moderately hot though.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You sort of contradict yourself there anon. Asian women are by far on average prettier. White women are in a way considered  to have a somewhat &#8216;horsey&rsquo; aspect to their appearance. </p>
<p>In any case the issue is entirely subjective. Traditional conceptions of Asian beauty - just look at any Tang or Sung era art of representations of beautiful women - are just so completely different from the Western ideal.</p>

<p>As for me, my wife who is white, is the most beautiful lady in the world. However, objectively speaking, as a rule I find Asian women far more attractive. And having a white wife is not contradictory with this opinion (even so, my wife does not know I post here).</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember seeing a TV program many years ago about an investigation into beauty. The objective was to determine whether there were objective, or at any rate inherent standards of beauty. The method used was to study infants and their reactions to strangers, noting where the infants looked, for how long, and other behaviours denoting attraction or avoidance.</p>
<p>The investigators found a number of characteristics that were regarded as attractive to infants of all races (therefore not learned). These included light skin, heart-shaped face, wide-set eyes among others. Of course, such a study would be impossible today - racist, sexist, probably heteronormative or homophobic, and definitely hate-filled (don&rsquo;t ask me, I don&rsquo;t make the rules).&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you know the name of this study, when it was aired, and how many infants were used? I really have to question the validity when &#8220;heart-shaped faces&#8221; were considered universally more attractive. I&rsquo;ve often heard oval faces are more attractive, but I&rsquo;ve gotten the general impression preferences for face shape are quite variable as long as they don&rsquo;t tend towards extremities.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve actually lived in Hong Kong among other places and countries in Asia. John Liu&rsquo;s remarks sometimes come off as theatre, written by a someone who is merely trying to irritate or perhaps derail conversation. Like others have stated, I would not be surprised if he were actually a Caucasian Marxist.  On to the point, I would think that the Asian women lightening their skin aren&rsquo;t trying to look white, they&rsquo;re just trying to look better in whatever way they feel makes them so. Other people have said the same. Mr. Liu&rsquo;s remark about leg shaving isn&rsquo;t quite on the button. Chinese women in fact do have to shave their legs, and so do Japanese women. SE Asian women rarely have to do so however, especially Vietnamese, Thais, etc. These women are looked down upon by the NE Asians but there&rsquo;s always going to be ethnic rivalries just as there is in Europe. Many Asian women have very smooth looking skin, but that changes when they are older. Mother Nature isn&rsquo;t full of pity for the old. No matter who they are are where they&rsquo;re from. </p>

<p>Not only do Asian women lighten their skin, they also dye their hair blonde or light brown and buy green or blue colored contact lenses.  If this isn&rsquo;t attempting to be White, then I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p>Most Asian men seem to prefer White women as well (what is this about a &#8220;horsey&#8221; appearance?) but White women (as well as other women) aren&rsquo;t interested.  The White women I have seen with Asian men tend to be female nerds and want a man who is also a nerd type.</p>

<p>Absolute utter baloney. All the Chinese women I have dated, my sister, do not shave their legs. I suppose &#8216;Not an Expatriate&rsquo; you have experience to prove otherwise - from dating, perhaps, a Chinese girl? After all people don&rsquo;t just go up and ask women acquaintances or colleagues,about their leg-shaving habits.</p>
<p>It is your comments that come off as theatre - this is most obvious when you parse the purported differences between Chinese, Vietnamese, etc - the &#8216;old Asia hand&rsquo; trick of proving oneself to be an &#8216;old Asia hand&#8221; - when really your understanding of the region is no more than that of the understanding a Chinese student in the US would have of the confederate history - i.e. completely stereotypical and superficial.</p>
<p>Chinese skin is naturally glabrous. In fact most white women have more hairy forearms than I do. Hairiness, and hair pits, make white women&rsquo;s skin naturally rough.</p>
<p>Chinese thus tend not to have a natural odour (although this is more related to us lacking stink glands - I believe) - as do Caucasoids  - thus we do not use deodorants in nearly the same amount as whites. Anyone who has been jampacked on a tram or bus in Hong Kong in mid-August where temperatures run up to 36degrees Celcius, will realize that Chinese are an essentially odourless race. If these same buses had been filled with whites - the stench would have been overpowering - regardless of how many bottles of deodorant splashed out to quell the smell.</p>

<p>Completely untrue. The rare times that one sees an Asian man with a white women, both are generally high-flyers and above average in attractivenss. In any case in Hong Kong itself, I have I think <i>never</i> seen a Hong Kon man with a white woman - or perhaps I don&rsquo;t hang round Central&rsquo;s Lan Kwai Fong enough.</p>
<p>So your observation is absurd - simply because there is not enough data for you to base it upon.</p>
<p>And where on earth did you get this idea that Asian men prefer white women? And what exactly do your base your assertion upon? How often do Asian men act lewdly and inappropriately around white women, let alone try to pick them up? Compared to white men around Asian women? Extremely uncommon in the former case, close to 100% in the latter.</p>
<p>But what is manifestly true is that Asian women who tend to date whites, invariably date nerdy, asocial, white men who are unattractive to white women. There is plenty of evidence for that. Step on to any university campus in the Western world.</p>
<p>Apparently some of these white men are outright sickos:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yjjwjrv</p>
<p>But this one of course, is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Whereas those few rare cases of Asian men with white women - both are generally, high achievers -  completely normal, successful, and healthy people.</p>

<p>Of course, speaking of objective standards of beauty raises a lot of philosophical issues. Maybe the whole concept of beauty is an anthropomorphism. So maybe an inherent standard is a better way to put it.  Which is not the same thing as a universal standard, since cultural influences can override our natural instincts.  I have read posts on this site, purporting to be from White men who say that they find black women attractive - and, to me, that is just inconceivable.</p>

<p>Thanks, but that page you link doesn&rsquo;t tell me much more. It builds up its case on the Marquadt beauty mask, which is highly problematic.</p>

<p>&#8220;The results of our symmetry experiments show a clear but only weak relationship between facial attractiveness and symmetry: very asymmetrical faces are rated unattractive, but unattractive faces don&rsquo;t need to be asymmetrical. Vice versa, very symmetrical faces don&rsquo;t need to be very attractive, and very attractive faces may show remarkable deviations from ideally symmetrical proportions. In summary, symmetry seems only to be a weak factor to explain facial attractiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also find it funny how that stormfront link drums up the beauty of white females AND males. Humans are significantly more ambivalent about male beauty than female beauty. The only non-whites who really care about white males are indians and a number of asian women- and the former does it usually purely out of general facial masculinity, not other features. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

		<p>I would like to add to comment #23. One of the major reasons that Asian women tend to have better skin longer in life is that they do not, from pre-puberty on slather their face with the endless concoctions of the cosmetic industry. My white mother scrubbed her face every morning with cold water and a face a cloth and thought it disgusting to resort to paint and powder. At the age of 90 she had clearer skin than most women half her age. Many of you may know women who have never used make up in their life, compare them to those who cannot leave the house without a few coats of paint.<br>
Certainly worth a scientific study, it will never be done because not only is there absolutely no money in it, it may ruin a few industries.</p>

<p>You find your statement not to be contradictory?  Did you ever stop to consider that most everybody reading your assertions are probably laughing at such a denial it is so obviously self-serving and childish? </p>
<p>After all the denigrations you have made regarding whites, do you really expect anybody to believe that you&rsquo;re married to a white woman?</p>
<p>And regarding odor, it is a well-known fact that the troops in Vietnam could literally smell the Vietnamese (and they included MANY Chinese advisors)before they saw them, due to the rank odor permeated by them due to their diet of fish, rice and a sauce made from rotting fish.</p>
<p>Too, what do you have to say about the skin of Japanese women?  I mean different Asian groups are as dissimilar as various other tribes of people who share a measure of DNA.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Japanese regard Chinese as inferiors, due to their backward ways and third world country, and their out of control birth rate which is literally destroying their country.</p>
<p>Chinese men would not have to worry about the skin of any woman if they would discontinue the practice of killing and/or abandoning female babies.  </p>
<p>The situation they are facing now is a shortage of women, and it has placed Chinese males in a dire predicament.  They are not attractive to white women; they don&rsquo;t have enough of their own women to provide enough wives, so their only alternative, in the final analysis,  is to marry African blacks, which could very well be one of the reasons China is expanding into Africa.</p>
<p>Of course the Chinese government would never allow the off-spring of these marriages to enter China, but having a colony of mixed races would be very helpful to a communist dictatorship that uses humans as slave laborers and regard people outside their race as inferior.  </p>

		<p>As usual, when I post and get into one subject, I tend to forget the others. Because of Spain&rsquo;s history of subjugation under the Moors and the subsequent racial mingling, the Spanish, like the Italians and the Portuguese, have a larger share of Moorish genes which are generally darker. Between the 17th and the beginnings of the 20th century there was an almost obsessive avoidance of the sun by the ladies of the upper classes. They were the ones who resorted to sun umbrellas, mantillas and veils, anything to avoid direct sunlight. I remember reading about a young lady who sat for hours on her rooftop with a huge sun hat whose crown had been cut off so that she could let the sun bleach her hair - a very desirable trait - without touching her face. This was in the 1600&rsquo;s, long before racism had been invented. Racism was only invented after WWII, until then it was known as the facts of life.</p>

		<p>S &amp; GS is correct. Asians in fact do have very strong body odors. Not because of the lack of scent glands (it is in fact the Koreans who lack scent glands) but because of their diets, many times connected with their habit of not &#8220;fully&#8221; bathing regularly. I have been close to tossing my cookies on public transit in Japan and Hong Kong because of the stench. Other people who have been in this situation or around large groups of Asian tourists in the US have experienced the same, we&rsquo;ve spoken about it. When I was working at NBC years ago, we had a group of Chinese in for some type of &#8220;Goodwill Tour&#8221; and the stink was so bad I found myself trying to twist my head in different directions for some fresh air. I noticed others doing the same. It was funny afterward. </p>
<p>That said I doubt the Asian women in this article are trying to look white. They&rsquo;re just trying to look better. </p>
<p>&#8220;John Liu&#8221; can&rsquo;t hide his jealousy towards white men no matter the topic. One can find freaks in all races. We have droves of Asian men with fetishes over white women, some of the fetishes extreme as cannibalism, as in the case of Issei Sagawa who murdered and then ate a Dutch girl while he was in Paris. For years he was a celebrity in Japan and E. Asia, appearing on talk shows everywhere, and so on. That says a lot. If someone wanted to press the issue, they could start publicly wondering why so many (I believe it may be a majority) of college campus shooters over the last 10 - 15 years have been Asian males. It seems no one wants to bring this up. As stated previously, there are freaks in all races. One thing I did notice while in Asia was the juvenile attitude toward sex, most of all in Japan but it is juvenile overall in E. Asia. I think it is possible this might be part of the reason we so many Asian women going after white men. White men get hit with the Asian fetish claim, but there is a high percentage of Asian women with white fetishes and in fact black fetishes. Visit Los Angeles for example and go to clubs or large theater / shopping areas like &#8220;City Walk&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll see this. Asian girls would openly chase non-Asian guys when I was in High School and later on in college it was more of the same. So it isn&rsquo;t entirely some fetish on the part of white men, there is more at work here, some psychological aspect or drive. Just like the drive for women of different races, including blacks, to make their skin lighter. It isn&rsquo;t trying to be white, it&rsquo;s trying to increase attractiveness. <br>

		<p>Several weeks ago, a blog dealing with race from a dating site (OKCupid) was the subject of discussion. The findings are particularly revealing not only because of the large number of people in the sample, but more so because the selection process was &#8220;anonymous&#8221; in the sense that people were selecting who they would be interested in dating through the internet, with race being one of the characteristics for which they had solid information.</p>
<p>This contrasts with polls or surveys, where several hundred people are asked about preferences. Like many surveys, people may be less than honest about their true feelings, particularly when one of the characteristics up for discussion is race. That&rsquo;s why when the topic of &#8220;Asian women - white men&#8221; comes up, you see such responses as &#8220;Hollywood image of white leading men&#8221; or &#8220;trying to fit in better with the dominant society&#8221; as major reasons why many Asian women are dating white men.</p>
<p>For white men? The rationale sometimes given is &#8220;belief that Asian women are more submissive&#8221; or the even more unflattering &#8220;yellow fever&#8221;.</p>
<p>Who knows what really lurks in the hearts of men (and women), but for whatever reason, the preferences anonymously expressed by thousands of respondents based on the data from the OKCupid site, seems to resonate with real world observations.</p>

		<p><i>In fact one day my diverse colleagues(S Asian and Black) were talking about the &ldquo;Asian Smell&rdquo; and how you have to beware when taking Chinatown buses.</i></p>
<p>True that some Chinese have hygiene related problems - China is still a Third World country, and Chinese from certain parts of China love their garlic. Chinese, as will any other people, smell if they don&rsquo;t wash or eat odor inducing foods. I have found Koreans sometimes to have an overpowering garlic stench.</p>
<p>But unlike whites, the Asians smelling is not <i>inherent</i> to their biology. This quote from an Amren article:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Blacks and whites have strong, but differing smells, and many Asians have scarcely any smell. Koreans often have no odor-producing glands in their arm-pits at all and Japanese have very few. Nineteenth-century Japanese found Europeans so foul-smelling that even today, a common Japanese expression for anything Western means &ldquo;stinking of butter.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>

		<p>Where leg-shaving goes, most - or many - Japanese women shave their legs.  Many of them also shave their arms.  They grow less than caucasian women, but it does grow.  If the south Chinese women Mr. Liu is most familiar with do not, I suspect this may be due to the Ainu influence in the Japanese bloodline (Japanese men can typically grow much more facial hair than Chinese, as evidenced by old photographs of the Meiji Emperor, who wore a full beard that would have made any Victorian Englishman proud.)</p>
<p>The difference in human smells has to be partly dietary - most whites eat a diet heavier in animal fats than east Asians.  Part of the gap in odor between whites and Japanese was closed when (1) their diet changed postwar - which also made them taller - and (2) more regular bathing by western whites.  I notice subcontinental Indians have a strong odor of their own, probably due to the spices associated with the curries they consume: cumin, garan masala, ginger, fenugreek, etc.  Chinese and Koreans have their own distinctive odors: garlic and kimchee.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I am manifestly not comfortable in anything approaching 35 degrees C and 90% humidity, and sweat like a pig.  My ancestry is entirely from northern Europe and northern North America (Cherokee and Tuskarora), and thus no part of my bloodline evolved to cope with weather as hot or humid as that of Hong Kong.  My simple solution to the problem is to live well outside areas with climates like this.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s an exageration to say asian women don&rsquo;t shave their arms, legs etc. at all- but they do have considerably less body hair than whites, albeit this is accentuated by testosterone differences.</p>
<p>Most blacks naturally have little to no body hair as well. It&rsquo;s only really the pygmies who have sizable amounts, or mixed ones, like american blacks.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>The only people with abundant body hair are Caucasoids, the most hairy ones are Anatolians and Caucasian people.</p>
<p>American blacks have far more than their African cousins due to their white bloods, the same is true for Indians who have no facial hair.</p>
<p>Among the Mongloids, only the Ainu people in Japan are &#8220;hairy&#8221;.</p>

		<p>People like &#34;anonymous&#34; and John Liu also forget that people are accustomed to their own groups odors. I would say that when I was in Asia I noticed that the people did smell bad and the body odor was probably due to their diets. I do not know why their hair would stink so much if not washed each day, so maybe the oils excreted in the scalp were different. I noticed this just like I noticed the different odor from blacks. East Asian men have very low testosterone levels on average, at least when compared to Caucasians and especially blacks, but I am not sure how this affects body hair overall because most Africans are relatively hairless, even in comparison to E. Asians. I thought the thread was about Asian women lightening their skin but the Asian supremacists are so insecure they always seek to attack Whites. I think it is due to some type of cognitive dissonance. Their cultures tell them they are superior. The White hating group in charge of the US tells them they and other non whites are superior to Whites. Whites are under attack on all sides yet still seem to have a small percentage who excel beyond what other groups are capable of. This bothers the various non white supremacists a great deal. This and seeing that roughly a third of Asian women in the US and not a small percentage of other non white women prefer White men over their own group. I think all people should stick to their own but the arrogance of non whites in seeing their women do this must cause a brain freeze, then their brains to fry. I can understand the irritation.</p>
<p>We have seen stories before of non white women lightening their skin. People prefer light skin over dark skin in general. This is different from trying to be white. It should be noted that time after time when polls are conducted, Europeans are almost always considered the most attractive people in the world, especially Northern Europeans. This has nothing to do with beauty contests, which these days are generally brainwashing expos aimed at having whites worship non whites. The fact that so much of the world considers European whites attractive is is why so many non white men prefer white women, including E Asians who try to deny it, yet only a small number of White women prefer non white men. This is because most women find White men more attractive than non white men. In the US, 97% of whites marry whites. Physical attractiveness probably has more than a little to do with it. Maybe it&#39;s the variance too. Whites have far more variance in their appearance than other races. If you look at the world outside of Europe in terms of eye color, hair color and so on most of the planet has black hair, brown or black eyes. That&#39;s it. European Whites have a full range of eye color, hair from black to almost white blonde, skin from alabaster to tanned and so on, with these traits mixed or combined. You do not see this wide variety of variance in other peoples. When I was in Korea and Japan I was struck by everyone having jet black hair, basically the same eye color, skin color, skin tone. In North Africa I again noticed this. </p>

		<p>Perhaps, afterall, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Having said this, I cannot subscribe to the notion that Asian or specifically Chinese women age better or more gracefully than white women. It didn&rsquo;t take me more than a minute on Google to find images to illustrate my point:</p>

<p>Michael C Scott. I think you may have a point here. Japanese men also have far greater beard growth than Chinese men. I have long surmised the same - that the relative hairiness of Japanese compared with Chinese can be put down to Ainu influence. My conjecture is that since the Ainu have been described as humanity&rsquo;s most hirsute race, perhaps only a tiny fraction of Ainu ancestry was enough to make the Japanese noticeably more hairy than other Asians. </p>
<p><i>I have been close to tossing my cookies on public transit in Japan and Hong Kong because of the stench.</i></p>
<p>That is a bald face lie - my expat friend have commented directly on how they were surprised of the <i>lack</i> of smell when on a Hong Kong tram. They were not being politically correct, because they contrasted this with the odour of people in Mainland China, especially Northern China. As for Japanese, in my limited experience during a weeklong visit to Tokyo, I found them to be the cleanest, most odourless, race of people I have ever come across.</p>

Absolute utter baloney. All the Chinese women I have dated, my sister, do not shave their legs. I suppose &lsquo;Not an Expatriate&rsquo; you have experience to prove otherwise - from dating, perhaps, a Chinese girl? After all people don&rsquo;t just go up and ask women acquaintances or colleagues,about their leg-shaving habits.</i></p>
<p>Sorry Johnny, but you <i>are</i> the one presenting bad theatre. I know Chinese women do have to shave their legs. If they want smooth legs. What you are doing is mixing fact and fiction. Most Chinese women in China don&rsquo;t shave their legs, but they have visible leg hair. They don&rsquo;t shave their armpits either in China. But in Westernized Hong Kong they do. Especially to wear short skirts. E Asian women do have less body hair than European women. That is true. Back to shaving legs, in the 90&rsquo;s while in Hong Kong I had Chinese women throwing themselves at me to be blunt. Probably because I was a young, tall white man. This happens to many, many white men when in Asia. Being in my early 20&rsquo;s at the time I took advantage of it. Yes, the girls had to shave their legs. I could go into other things but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that. I did get some angry, jealous looks from Chinese men, but none of them ever tried to give me trouble.  John Liu, I find your panicked jealousy and disingenuousness almost comical. I have seen other posts from you and you simply write whatever you want, stating your wishes and hoping to have others swallow them as facts. I&rsquo;m white and married to a white woman, but I don&rsquo;t hate Asians. You come off as conflicted, an Asian male who hates white men but who is supposedly married to a white woman. You should look into the source of this inner conflict. </p>
