			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Chivers, London Telegraph, October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A crowd of hundreds attended the wedding between Ahmed Muhamed Dore and Safia Abdulleh in Guriceel, in the Galguduud region of Somalia. Mr Dore said: &#8220;Today God helped me realise my dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Dore and his teenage bride are from the same village, and he said that he had waited for her to grow up before proposing.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t force her, but used my experience to convince her of my love, and then we agreed to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bride&rsquo;s family said she was &#8220;happy with her new husband&#8221;.</p>
<p>At 95 years older than her  &mdash;  if his claimed age is accurate  &mdash;  he is old enough to be her great-great-great-grandfather.</p>
<p>He already has 18 children by his other five wives.</p>
<p>According to Somali historians, the wedding is the first of its kind in Somalia for over a century.<br>

		<p>Why did this Lothario wait so long?  Think of the wonderful times this couple have missed not marrying when she was 9 and he was 103.  Maybe western values are polluting the pure native culture.  Shouldn&rsquo;t they come to the US? and go on Oprah?</p>

<p>Is that an admission of pedophilia? Perhaps not in Somalia; 17 years old sounds a little on the old side for a new bride.</p>

		<p>I actually laughed when I first read this story.  Does anyone really believe anything&rsquo;s going to happen between these two?  If he&rsquo;s really that old he probably doesn&rsquo;t even remember what to do with her.</p>
<p>My guess is her family paired her off with him with the expectation he&rsquo;ll kick off any day now, and she&rsquo;ll collect something for her trouble.</p>

<p>Yes, and when his family and friends told him that the marriage could be fatal, he replied through an interpreter, &#8220;Well, if she dies, she dies.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Wait, what? Do Somalis think this is okay? Do U.S. Somalis think this is okay? As a white male, am I supposed to respect women, as the feminists tell me? Or am I supposed to respect polygamists, of color, as the multi-culturalists tell me? Is this okay for Somalis and not for white males? If not, why not? And am I wrong to find the idea of a wooing an underage girl sick and wrong? Am I wrong to find the idea of a 112 year old man with five wives marrying a 17-year old wrong? If it&rsquo;s not wrong, why isn&rsquo;t it? How can he provide for his children if he&rsquo;s 112? And if these people are reproducing so quickly how can we take them all in? Feed them? Do they expect foreign aid? Does this 112 year old man expect me to feed all his children? </p>

		<p>   In conventional Islam four wives are normal. The prophet himself had a young teenage wife among his women. I guess we better get used to it. It is all part of the new multiculturalism. I feel sorry for the indigenous British women under the new Sharia Law. They shouldn&rsquo;t have voted for Labour. </p>

		<p>with all the sadness experienced in today&rsquo;s world,if happiness comes our way,if just for a moment&rsquo; we would all take hold of it. and clearly this story is of two people who has done just so. i wish them all the best. <br>
and as for the comments at no 14 the somali&rsquo;s are hard working people and not looking for a hand out, just a hand up. and in these difficult times we (The World )are all in need of a hand up. i say congratulations to them.</p>

		<p>i&rsquo;m ashamed at some of those comments- no, he doesnt expect you to pay for his kids! he doesnt live here!<br>
  this is the one off, which is why it was reported. stop using strange people as excuses for racism please ^.^<br>
   anyhow. &#8220;used my experience to convince her of my love, and then we agreed to marry.&rdquo; is it just me or does this sound really wrong :P i guess you&rsquo;d have to be pretty &#8216;experienced&rsquo; to have eighteen kids, though :P</p>

		<p>Pamela, Rebecca: Are you kidding? Have you heard of foreign aid? Ever wonder why it is necessary? Think the fact young women are forced into early marriages with old men who can&rsquo;t provide for them might be part4 of it? Also: you&rsquo;re telling me it &#8220;with all the sadness experienced in today&rsquo;s world,if happiness comes our way,if just for a moment&rsquo; we would all take hold of it&#8221; &hellip; So if I fall in love with a 17-year old girl it&rsquo;s okay for me to marry her because it makes me &#8220;happy&#8221;? What about my wife? Doesn&rsquo;t her happiness count? I&rsquo;m sorry, isn&rsquo;t this called a double-standard? And yes, I do have a say in this, because my tax dollars go to foreign aid for these people.  </p>

		<p>To the contrary Mr. &#8220;Kulars never learn&#8221;, polygomy would destroy the white race. Our monogomy and tradition of marriage is what seperates us from other races. Attempts to marry blacks after emancipation failed atrociously. The institution of marriage makes sure that every child is provided for. </p>
<p>I am a woman, willing to have plenty of children for our race&rsquo;s future. We need to undue the liberal brainwashing so that there are more aspiring mothers and fathers. That&rsquo;s the answer. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not lose our traditions in a panic.   </p>

		<p>your comments at number 21 is noted. however&rsquo; i believe that you have mis-understood my comments.i will put this in simple english for you.i am awere of foreign aid. i work for free for a charity in support of children in the uk. many without fathers, most who doesnt pay child support.i also support 2 others charities for free. i am a working single parent, with no goverment hand out.what two conssenting adults does its their buisness, and no&rsquo; if you fall in love with a 17 year old girl be sure that the feelings are mutral.who am i to judge or anyone else for that matter.please please leave the politics to the professionals. no BNP wanted thank you. its only about two people a long long way away, just wish them well in the mean time, what harm could they possibly do you? perhaps a little jealous are you?  </p>
