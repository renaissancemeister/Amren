<h1>Tedesco&rsquo;s Easy Victory Puts Change on Track</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Goldsmith and T. Keung Hui, Raleigh News &amp; Observer, November 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s overwhelming victory by John Tedesco in a Wake County school board runoff means busing for diversity and other established policies will be squarely in the crosshairs of a new majority taking the reins of the 140,000-student Wake system Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Tedesco, a New York-born executive of Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Triangle, outpolled educator Cathy Truitt by more than three to one in District 2, which includes Garner, Fuquay-Varina and Willow Spring. The win solidifies the prospect of a turnaround for the Wake County school system, which has attracted national attention and, in the eyes of its supporters, had helped build the reputation of Raleigh and Wake County as an attractive place to live.</p>
<p>Tedesco and three other recently elected members of the new majority withstood opposition from a coalition of traditional Raleigh power brokers as they promised to discard forced busing for diversity in favor of a system of neighborhood schools. The successful candidates questioned the effectiveness of the diversity policy and promoted allowing children to go to schools in their communities, even if the change results in racially and economically imbalanced schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tedesco received more votes  &mdash;  unofficial results gave him 6,658  &mdash;  than were cast overall in the first round of voting Oct. 6, when the ballot included five candidates, including incumbent Horace Tart.</p>
<p>Tedesco will join current board member Ron Margiotta and recently elected members Chris Malone, Debra Goldman and Deborah Prickett, all of whom have vowed to stop forced busing for diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parents just had enough,&#8221; Prickett said Tuesday. &#8220;The public has spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to opposing the policy of busing for diversity, members of the new majority have pledged to end mandatory year-round school attendance and potentially stop the &#8220;Wacky Wednesday&#8221; policy of weekly early dismissals for teacher planning time. The board will also have to deal with system growth that has lessened in recent years, but still brings as many as 2,000 new students to the system annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state NAACP has vowed to watch the new board&rsquo;s actions and, if necessary, take legal action to prevent school resegregation. Some parents fear reassigning students to neighborhood schools will harm the magnet school program.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad Tedesco won.  But he and the people on the school board who think like him, now the majority, should be ready to be blamed for every black academic failure in Wake County&rsquo;s public schools.  They&rsquo;ll be convenient scapegoats.  They should be ready to defend themselves, and stay the course.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also glad they want to dump year round schooling.  I think the effort for longer school days and longer school years are outgrowths of racial egalitarians who insist that we need to put black children in a &#8220;better environment&#8221; so they all become Einsteins.  A regular poster here on AR showed how KIPP academies are essentially semi-orphanages, but have an advantage over public schools b/c they get to kick troublemakers out.  With all that money and time, the best KIPP can do is get black children (a certain select few, mind you) CLOSE to the white middle school average on certain core subject tests.</p>

		<p>Relevant: Wake County Schools (Raleigh area) and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) are almost identical in size (roughly 130,000 students) and demographics, though Charlotte (CMS) has somewhat more poverty.</p>
<p>CMS was forced by a lawsuit to abandon forced busing for racial schools in 2002 and then reverted to that most retrograde form of schooling known as neighborhood schools. </p>
<p>Wake County, in contrast, decided to pursue forced busing for &#8220;socioeconomic balance,&#8221; thus avoiding student assignments based strictly on race.</p>
<p>Wake County schools is thus a national model for how to use large county school systems to engineer correct racial/ethnic balances in schools.  The chief criteria is percentage of students entitled to free or reduced lunches.  Wake tried to make sure no school had more than 40 percent of such students.</p>
<p>Alas, in turns out that Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, with their neighborhood schools, are doing better by poor and ethnic minority students than Wake County.  Details:</p>
<p>Scores up for black, poor teens in CMS<br>
In a striking change from 2004, those students now outperform counterparts in Wake, across N.C.<br>

HIGHLIGHTS:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black and low-income teens in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools are now outperforming their peers statewide and in Wake County, new state report cards show.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider: In 2004, CMS black students&rsquo; pass rate on state high-school exams was 45 percent, 10 percentage points below the state average and 18 points below Wake&rsquo;s black students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2009, CMS black students had a 65 percent pass rate, 12 points above the state and 6 points above Wake&rsquo;s. CMS&rsquo;s low-income and Hispanic students outperformed the same groups statewide and in Wake, though by smaller margins.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Good for the new school board members! Let&rsquo;s start educating the kids again, and stop sorting them out by race and economic status.</p>
<p> As to the NAACP, as I&rsquo;ve said before in this forum, the best cure for an organization&rsquo;s predilection to sue people at the drop of a hat, is to sue them right back, and keep suing them, until they&rsquo;re bankrupt. And don&rsquo;t tell me a couple of good lawyers couldn&rsquo;t come up with some very valid reasons to do so!</p>

		<p>OK. I am glad that the anti-diversity candidate won, and that the school district will ATTEMPT to return to policies of neighborhood schools, and not forced social engineering. But, please, fellow AMREN posters. Don&rsquo;t be naive: The results of a democratic election mean nothing. Have the American People ever been asked to vote on busing, affirmative action, minority college admission preferences, etc.? Of course not. This is Communistic. The liberal multiculturalists will just get some judge, and the busing plan, in the name of &#8220;fairness&#8221; will be reimplemented, regardless of what most people want, or what their elected representatives try to do. I hate to say this, but I am afraid that America is not really a democracy anymore, and powerful groups, with a multiculturalist agenda, are pulling the strings, and will just impose their will on us all by force, if necessary.</p>

		<p> Let us hope that John Tedesco, although disliked by the NAACP, will, like Hercules, clean Wayne County&rsquo;s Augean Stables. The days of &#8220;forced busing&#8221; for diversity must come to an end. If it takes a Pisan from New York to do it, so be it. </p>

one reason that the NAACP, ACLU and SPLC, cannot be sued out of existence is that they&rsquo;re able to recoup most of their legal expenses from the government. That&rsquo;s right, were paying these Clowns to ruin our country.<br>

		<p>Busing has always and only been about helping minority, esp. black students at the expense of the children of white parents who are expected to be sucker enough to sacrifice what&rsquo;s best for their children while stupidly congratulating themselves for embracing &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Liberals in their heart of hearts don&rsquo;t believe that black children can learn in a classroom filled with other blacks and taught by black teachers in a school with a black principal.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so adamantly in favor of forced busing.  So who are the real racists?  After all, those same liberals see no reason why Japanese children can&rsquo;t learn in a classroom filled by other Japanese and taught by Japanese teachers in a school with a Japanese principal.<br>
