<h1><a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local-beat/Levon-Tebelekian-Visa-Fake-Exams-69127617.html">LA Doctor Allegedly Faked Exams for Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Olsen Ebright, KNBC-TV (Los Angeles), November 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Levon Tebelekian, 72, is accused of giving medical clearance to immigrants applying for U.S. visas by allegedly falsifying the results of medical exams and lab tests, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>
<p>In one case, he allegedly told an undercover ICE agent that he was not going to &#8220;disturb his blood&#8221; and that he &#8220;did not look like he had AIDS,&#8221; according to an affidavit.</p>
<p>Authorities are unsure how many other patients were victims of the alleged scam and may have received one of these apparent visual AIDS tests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;By allegedly giving some of his patients a clean bill of health without even examining them, this physician potentially put our communities at risk,&#8221; Unzueta [Miguel Unzueta, of ICE in Los Angeles] said.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s Armenian. He went to med school in Armenia. He may not have benefitted much from AA, but immigration did him some good&hellip;.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s Armenian. Armenians are considered white folks by the govt., so they aren&rsquo;t eligible for affirmative action. He may not have had his medical training in the US anyway.<br>
A small but significant minority of Armenians in the LA area, especially the ones from the former Soviet Union, have organized crime connections (mostly credit card and health care fraud). But it isn&rsquo;t fair to judge Armenians in general by these types any more than it is to judge all Italians by the Mafia.<br>

		<p>1 Francois: The &#8220;ian&#8221; or &#8220;yan&#8221; ending on a family name is almost universal among Armenians, though quite a few other peoples use it as well.  I once went to a Soviet trained Armenian doctor and was impressed with his diagnostic skill, so I&rsquo;d be reluctant to pin this on Armenian doctors as a group.  <br>
     OTOH, my doctor made his accurate diagnosis entirely by looking and touching, ordering tests afterwards simply because that&rsquo;s what American doctors did.  He&rsquo;d been trained to do without elaborate tests because they weren&rsquo;t available in the USSR anyway.  Maybe this Dr Tebelikian was just a little too old fashioned to go with new-fangled high-tech blood tests.  </p>

		<p>Armenians are just-on-the-literal-borderline Europeans or Asians.</p>
<p>However, Armenian-Americans have been turned down by US colleges when claiming special affirmative action privileges on the grounds that they qualify as Asians.</p>
<p>Puzzling.</p>

		<p>George Deukmejian was the Governor of California from 1983 to 1991.  He was born in the Albany, NY area.  Albany and SoCal seem to be the big Armenian-American centers.</p>
<p>The irony of this is that Bush 41 considered Deukmejian as a running mate during his successful run for President in 1988, but he didn&rsquo;t want the grind of a national campaign, so Bush settled on Dan Quayle.  Bush 43 did everything in his power to stifle Congressional resolutions against the Turkish genocide of Armenians, because Turkey is supposed to be a great ally in the whatchamacallit war on somebody or some tactic.</p>
