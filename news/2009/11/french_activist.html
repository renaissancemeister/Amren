<h1>French Activists Strike Back</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i><font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On October 16, 2009, the president of the French nuclear power company, Areva, said on French television that the company would rather hire women or immigrants, anyone but a &#8220;white male.&#8221; On October 22, one of the company directors, Daniel Guillon, took part in a public corporate PR meeting in the city of Aubagne.</p>
<p>An activist from the French group Reconquista (the word means something different in France) took the floor to challenge the company&rsquo;s anti-white hiring polices and to suggest that since Mr. Guillon is a &#8220;white male,&#8221; he should set an example by resigning and offering his job to one of the protected classes. The question elicited a brisk round of applause. A YouTube clip of the exchange  &mdash;  unfortunately only in French  &mdash;  is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHc89JsxgCM" target="reconquista" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a> Reconquista activists then distributed flyers in the area denouncing Areva&rsquo;s anti-white policies.</p>
<p>On November 5, the editor of ID [Identity] magazine, Pierre Chatov, gave a lecture entitled &#8220;From the USA to Areva: A Little Story About Affirmative Action.&#8221; The poster for the talk leaves no doubt about the perspective of ID magazine.</p>

		<p>Well yeah&hellip;&hellip;but here in the US a situation as depicted by that poster would be the prologue to a gang rape by a group of black thugs not merely a free speech or hiring issue.  Give it time though, France.  Give it time.  It starts with affirmative action and bleeding heart programs.  And ends with a class of citizens who think they can do anything, get away with anything, and who feel the power over whites from constantly being pandered to.  Then comes the horrific crimes, the degeneration of your communities into replicas of African cesspits, and the destruction of education, order, and civil society ultimately.</p>

		<p>The French engineers need to form a union and strike.  Demand the arrest of Guillon on hate charges like those they&rsquo;ve used against Bridget Bardot.  Let the traitors in the French government choose between the &#8220;youths&#8221; in the &#8220;suburbs&#8221; and the White men who keep the lights on.  No White nation can last a day without Whites to run it.  It&rsquo;s time for a Sixth Republic, one that explicitly recognizes the French as the owners of the country, and expels the Moslems and their White allies.  </p>

		<p>I guess hispanophone invader in America use the word &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; to promote their historical fraud of a Mexican noth america&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
But it simply means means reconquest in spanish and for us, europeans who know about their History, it refers to the 7 century long war against the north-african and muslims invaders of Spain. Young patriots use sometimes this word to draw parallels with the present time.</p>
<p>(And precisely, the word in the vid√©o is &#8220;Recounquista&#8221;, the equivalent term in south of France dialects.)</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>At a moment in the middle of the video, the man who is meant to lead the &#8220;debate&#8221; say loudly that he is french himself, while he is a black man with a very distinguishable african accent.</p>
<p>Then he tries to drown the fish and argue it is a very good and important question but it is not the apropriate time to discuss it.</p>
<p>As the activist insist and claim no one in Areva answered to phone calls or E-mails, Daniel Guillon feel forced to talk,  but only to say he has no influence on hiring policies in Areva.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Talking about hiring practices in sensitive corporation, it remember me the young &#8220;french&#8221; physicist (of north african descent and of course muslim) who worked at the CERN and plotted (probably all by himself) some nuclear terrorism.</p>
<p>Or military officials of the highest rank praising diversity hiring policies in the french army&hellip;</p>

<p>France&rsquo;s non-French &#8220;conservative&#8221; president Sarkozy has called for American style anti-white discrimination(&#8220;affirmative action&#8221;) to be implemented in France.   </p>

		<p>I totally believe that all white males strongly supporting or advocating Affirmative Action should be the first to give up their jobs to minorities. That&rsquo;s the only fair thing. They should not be allowed to give away other people&rsquo;s jobs, while keeping their own. Since none of them seem willing to give up their own jobs first, it appears that they do not really believe in their own claptrap. Perhaps, far more of these sorts would see the light if they were affected by their own policies.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   Finally what Bobby?  The borders in the US are still open and 3rd worlders are still flooding in.  Obama wants amnesty for all of them.  We&rsquo;re being mugged, raped, murdered, having our neighborhoods destroyed, everyone group under the sun is fighting for their own power but Whites, and I could go on and on with this.</p>
<p>The bottom line is WE HAVE A LONG, LONG, WAY TO GO. - And that&rsquo;s probably an understatement.</p>

Yes, I noticed that.   And they&rsquo;re right too, except that I would narrow it down further.  I hope they realize that not ALL Americans are behind this stuff and are pushing it on the world, just some certain groups. </p>

		<p>  <i>&#8220;Metal barriers were erected in an attempt to contain the crowd,  but people clambered over them. Angry youths also hurled missiles at police.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>My, my!  Those  golldarned Parisian  &#8220;youths&#8221; are at it again.    Look just like homeys from Harlem, I&rsquo;d say!   Indistinguishable.   And this time right in central Paris, in a fashionable area,  &#8220;in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower&#8221; &hellip; not in the   &#8220;immigrant suburbs&#8221;.   No longer!</p>
<p>They are getting more and more brazen with each riot, having been so successful thus far, with the police/government always backing down and offering groveling concessions.   What will this Christmas-New Year&rsquo;s bring?  It could get exciting.  Somewhere within the next 5 to 10 years, we&rsquo;re going to see  The Big One.</p>
<p>Paris is gradually filling up with &#8220;youths&#8221;.   Doesn&rsquo;t anybody notice that?  If so, no one dares talk about it. When these, uh, deprived &#8220;youths&#8221; grow up and produce more depived &#8220;youths&#8221;  of their own,  and there are more &#8220;youths&#8221; than Frenchmen,  the situation will be out of hand.</p>
<p>Thanks for that link, GenX.  <br>

		<p>#9 Awakened, yes, we have and incredibly long way to go if we can even do it. What I was expressing was the amazement, that finally, at a relatively high level of corporate beurocracy, one man stood up to the cowardly corporate status quo. Nothing like this has happened before, especially in the cowardly arena of American corporations, where employees regularly get to &#8220;train their replacements.&#8221;</p>
<p>What these people should tell those bosses is  &mdash;  GO TO HELL. YOU TRAIN THEM!! But the problem is,too many Americans live from check to check, and are slaves to their chosen lifestyles, until they get a wake-up call. I saw this when I was a union member. While I and many others fought for our pay, and rights, others negated our work by using the usual excuse,&#8221;Hey, I got bills to pay,etc. I had bills to pay also, but tried not to live from paycheck to paycheck.</p>
<p>I say Bravo, for the activist that challanged the corporate slob and bigot towards white people, Mr. Guillon. There is so much to discuss on this topic that we could spend a year on it. One place we could start is, why so many Americans are getting screwed and won&rsquo;t get together to do anything about it, and I mean get together by the hundreds of thousands. How come the hispanics can do it, who aren&rsquo;t even in the nation legally?? Yeah, you bet we have A LONG LONG, WAY TO GO!!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re so right, Bobby!   It&rsquo;s really a great problem getting people to work together and see a common interest.  When it comes down to fighting over jobs or pay, it&rsquo;s dog eat dog&hellip; like starving dogs fighting over a bone.  Each one out for himself.  The Powers That Be are obsessed with keeping people from getting together.  It&rsquo;s their worst nightmare. They try to keep you separate and disunited while they pick you off individually. </p>
<p>I was involved in the &#8220;downsizing&#8221; of a major, very well known bank. In a stretched-out six-month program of job eliminations, they were extremely careful to keep people apart, separate, compartmentalized,  and then pick off each one  &hellip;. one-by-one.  Meantime, they continued to deny, right up to the very last, that they were laying off anyone;  and they assured everyone that no jobs or pay grades would be lost   &mdash;   only that there would be transfers to other equal or better positions.   They called in an outside management firm to handle this delicate operation, a firm that was experienced in these matters and knew just what to do, since this was their specialty and they had done it many times before. They had all the advantages because they had done it hundreds of times, and you had probably never been through it even once. You didn&rsquo;t know what what coming, but they did. They knew exactly every step.</p>
<p>Seen in hindsight, their strategy was to treat each case individually, isolate you, reassure you, then suddenly eliminate you before you knew what was happening.  One at a time!  They had many strategies of doing this.  For instance, they would transfer you to what looked like a promotion   &mdash;    a very nice job, an enviable job, in a remote branch where you knew nobody and had no friends   &mdash;  - and then decide a month later that your job was deemed inessential after all, and abolish it.  Since people there didn&rsquo;t know you and resented your promotion over them, there was no one to sympathize with you. That was just one strategy.</p>
<p>The whole point in these cases is to keep people confused and disunited. And to keep you hopeful  right up to the last possible minute that this won&rsquo;t really happen to you.   Maybe to other people, but not YOU!   If you worked EXTRA hard, and were EXTRA productive, perhaps you might be saved.  You hoped!  It&rsquo;s like animals being led into the slaughterhouse:  they have to be kept calm and reassured up to the last instant.  Then suddenly, it&rsquo;s too late.  Management doesn&rsquo;t want a riot or a stampede; they don&rsquo;t want any trouble, they want you to go quietly when your usefulness has been served and you&rsquo;re no longer essential.</p>

		<p>In such a context, I recall the fact of France&rsquo;s smug 1950s and 60s lecturing of America in general and the South in particular with some satisfaction.  Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch.  I know, pan-white solidarity and all.  But they really had this coming.</p>

They surely get advice and sponsorship from those who ARE in the country legally. From those who know the laws and how to manipulate them.  These border jumpers aren&rsquo;t doing it all on their own. Without leadership, they&rsquo;d be just a milling herd.</p>

		<p>#14, Anonymous, thanks for the specific examples that rounded out my post. It&rsquo;s despicable and I could relate to it in at least one company I&rsquo;d worked for in the past. As I said, a full treatment of this whole subject would involve a discussion of topics like how multiculturalism gets used by corporatists to make the concept of &#8220;American&#8221; meaningless, the bad part of laizze faire capitalism, the error of allowing the political elite to act as if the U.S. is nothing but an &#8220;economic zone&#8221;, rather than a distinct nation of individual citizens invested in the economic wellbeing of their nation and thus their own wellbeing,etc. As you rightly said, Americans have allowed themselves to be used and abused by having the divide and conquer strategy be used against us, and I might add, through the use of multiculturalism and other devious &#8220;isms&#8221;. Take care.</p>
