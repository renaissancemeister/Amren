<h1>No Blacks Allowed? NBA Sanctions Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lenn Durant, rollingout.com, November 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling agreed to pay $2.73 million in a discrimination lawsuit settlement brought by the U.S. Department of Justice for refusing to rent apartments to African Americans and Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}The settlement is the largest in U.S. history for housing discrimination.</p>
<p>NBA commissioner David Stern, the NBA and the NBA Players Association have been silent in response to the suit. To complicate matters, this is just one of several law suits against Sterling that involves racial discrimination, housing discrimination and even sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame great Elgin Baylor was the general manager of the Clippers for 22 years. The 75-year-old Baylor is currently suing Sterling, the Clippers and the NBA for being forced out of his job because of his age and race.</p>
<p>Sterling also settled another unrelated housing discrimination suit for an undisclosed amount and a reported $5 million in attorney&rsquo;s fees. That settlement in 2003 was two weeks after a sexual harassment suit that also alleged housing and hiring discrimination. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If NBA and NFL players are held accountable for their actions, so too must the owners. As a whole the black community should be outraged and should join forces to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>If you believe racist owners have no place in the NBA, which is over 90 percent black, then make your voice heard. Contact the NBA offices in New York and file a complaint at (212) 407-8000. Also let the L.A. Clippers know your position by calling (213) 742-7500.<br>

<p>Yes, the irony of that statement is glaring but I believe that the writer is staking a claim.</p>
<p>&#8216;90% black? We should OWN the NBA&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He wants to take it from the white man and give it to the black man.</p>

		<p>Nobody should EVER watch basketball.  There&rsquo;s too much anti-white discrimination.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be convinced that there arent plenty of good white players who should be in professional basketball.  After all, many all white teams beatr these professionals in the Olympic games.  Considering that, it doesn&rsquo;t stand to reason white players can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>The best thing to do, however, is to do as I have done and that is tune out and tune off all professional sports forever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how much there is to enjoy without all that black chaos to contend with.</p>
<p>Nowadays basketball amounts to practically nothing more than running back and forth over the court and slam dunking the basketball.  Tactics and strategy are non-existent, and the mental part of the game is gone forever.  In a word it is b-o-r-i-n-g.</p>

		<p> That ANY black would consider protesting about &#8220;discrimination&#8221; in the NBA is both funny and ludicrous. They&rsquo;ve totally dominated the league for many years! Some teams have hardly any White players! And Elgin Baylor, who received honors on top of honors as an NBA player and then coached for 22 years, is the LAST person who should have the right to play the race card when he was finally put out to pasture.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the NBA, which is over 90 percent black.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are constantly bombarded with the lie that all races are basically the same, and any disparity in outcome is the result of racism and past misdeeds. Anyone who dares to question this lie by pointing out that some races are innately more intelligent than others (even when adjusted for economic status), and that racial disparity in achievement and crime is actually because of innate racial differences in IQ and morality, is branded as a terrible heretic.</p>
<p>Well, what is the liberal and egalitarian explanation for blacks comprising 90% of the NBA dispite being around 13% of the American population? Certainly no liberal believes that the reason for black overrepresentation in sports is because wide-spread racism towards whites and past misdeeds towards us. Of course, the liberal will <i>never</i> admit that blacks are racially better in athletics, which is the obvious answer, because doing so would shatter the lie of egalitarianism.</p>
<p>Liberals have true-believer syndrome when they see undeniable proof that whites are intellectually superior to blacks and blacks are better athletes. Getting liberals to admit the obvious would be met with hostility, hatred and a lot of name-calling.</p>

<p>I was thinking the same thing. Million dollar lawsuit - this is one more white man that wont be in the rental business. And couldn&rsquo;t that be the whole point? </p>
<p>They say whites are being run out of the state of California. <br>

		<p>Perhaps after owning a team with a lot of black players Donald Sterling learned enough about typical black behavior to know that he didn&rsquo;t want to rent to them.</p>

I stopped watching NLF and NBA in 1980 when they openly declared they would recruit blacks to get whites to look up to them. This was around the same time they gave Michael Jordon 40-100 million dollor contract and gave Larry bird a pitence.</p>
<p>The actual discrimination takes place by the college recruiters, they go right past the white suburban teams to recruit players from the lower scoring inner city black teams, because the NBA and NFL want black players.</p>
<p>As for the MLB, they are more sublte in their anti white discrimination, they just put their farm teams in  non white countries.</p>
<p>www.Castefootball.us covers a lot of the anti white discrimination in sports</p>

		<p>  The NBA is 90% black.<br>
  Where are the employment quotas for Hispanics, Chinese, Indians, Jews, Arabs, Asian Indians etc. ?<br>
  The NBA must be racist if it doesn&rsquo;t have those members&hellip; since they are all minorities. If not why not ?</p>

<p>I guess the owner was blind, had his sight restored two decades later and then fired Baylor after realizing he wasn&rsquo;t white&hellip;  </p>

		<p>#4 i agree with mostly.</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a scenario.<br>
90% black? Fine. Let the numbers of management, coaches, and crowd attendees reflect this in quotas. Ticket prices would probably drop and riots in the stands would likely occur etc. Let &#8216;em have it.</p>

		<p>While I can see there is an element of truth to anti-White discrimation in major sports, it also shows that the white man must put in 10x the work, practice, and perseverance to make it in the NBA and NFL. Baseball is still considered a White/Hispanic sport with a large influx of Asian players. Overall whites are not taught by their parents to forget about school and put sports ahead of everything else. Because most whites in college sports and high school sports have a plan if sports do not work out to a career. Many blacks don&rsquo;t have that. Especially in the Caribbean, where baseball is the only way out. But that&rsquo;s their own doing. Don&rsquo;t blame whites for that. Blame your corrupt governments for not distributing the wealth. Yet they want the whites to distribute their wealth for the poor minorities. You gotta clean up your own back yard before you can help your neighbor with his. Also this writer is obviously black, so let him see where the high paid black athletes actually live in the off-season. I would bet my house on the fact that most if not all, live in predominantly white neighborhoods where the yards are kept up, the streets are clean, there are no ho&rsquo;s trying to get you to give her a try on the street corner. That&rsquo;s what people hate to talk about. Also alot of mainstream blacks use the term &#8220;hater&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t be a hater. They are the biggest offenders of this. They hate people that work hard and earn their living. They are too lazy so they rob and steal to get it. Well, then in turn, I hate them. It&rsquo;s only fair. </p>
