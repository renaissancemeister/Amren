<h1>11-Year-Old Gives Birth to Baby Girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After Going Into Labor at Her Wedding</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Degarmo, New York Daily News, November 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An 11-year-old girl became one of the world&rsquo;s youngest mothers  &mdash;  after she went into labor at her wedding.</p>
<p>Kordeza Zhelyazkova, from Sliven, Bulgaria, was still wearing her wedding dress and tiara when she was rushed to the hospital, where she gave birth to a 5-pound, 8-ounce girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to play with toys anymore  &mdash;  I have a new toy now,&#8221; Kordeza told reporters as she showed off little Violeta.</p>
<p>Kordeza  &mdash;  who got pregnant two weeks after her 11th birthday  &mdash;  told the News of the World: &#8220;It feels strange .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now I must grow up. I am not going back to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The baby&rsquo;s 19-year-old dad, Jeliazko, met Kordeza when he rescued her from bullies in the playground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But within a week, Kordeza was pregnant  &mdash;  and Jeliazko was facing six years in jail for having sex with a minor. The age of consent in Bulgaria is 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she was 15,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She didn&rsquo;t tell me she was 11. I was really scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want to say in case he wouldn&rsquo;t fancy me,&#8221; Kordeza confessed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s normal for our girls to have babies young,&#8221; said Kordeza&rsquo;s grandmother Dida, 55. &#8220;It&rsquo;s our tradition. But I didn&rsquo;t want it for my Kordeza  &mdash;  I felt she was too young.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Violeta&rsquo;s grandmothers will be her guardians, and Kordeza and her daughter will receive about $115 a month in state benefits.<br>

		<p>Hmm, I know some races mature physically faster than others, but how is this possible? </p>
<p>And multiculturalism&hellip;if we are to accept all cultures into our own country, does this mean we must also accept marriage by 11 year olds?</p>

		<p>As I was reading this, I thought to my self &#8220;these people have got to be Roma&#8221;. Then, sure enough, &#8220;The family planned a three-day Roma wedding so Kordeza and Jeliazko could be married before the baby arrived.&#8221; I&rsquo;m clairvoyant! If only I did this well with lottery numbers&hellip;</p>

		<p>There is so much about this article that is absolutely obscene (among other things)!</p>
<p>1) &#8216;&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to play with toys anymore - I have a new toy now,&#8221; Kordeza told reporters as she showed off little Violeta.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, this kid is going to make a great mother!</p>
<p>2) &#8216;Kordeza - who got pregnant two weeks after her 11th birthday - told the News of the World: &#8220;It feels strange&hellip;now I must grow up. I am not going back to school.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Welcome to the wonderful twin worlds of public assistance and the criminal justice system, kid.</p>
<p>3) &#8220;The baby&rsquo;s 19-year-old dad, Jeliazko, met Kordeza when he rescued her from bullies in the playground.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d comment on that, but then I&rsquo;d be in violation of AmRen&rsquo;s commenting guidelines.</p>
<p>4) &#8216;&#8220;I thought she was 15,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She didn&rsquo;t tell me she was 11. I was really scared.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course you did, Jeliazko.  The fact you first met her in a playground (where she was being picked on by pre-pubescent bullies) didn&rsquo;t tip you off to anything.</p>
<p>5) &#8216;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to say in case he wouldn&rsquo;t fancy me,&rdquo; Kordeza confessed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No comment.</p>
<p>6) &#8216;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal for our girls to have babies young,&rdquo; said Kordeza&rsquo;s grandmother Dida, 55. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our tradition. But I didn&rsquo;t want it for my Kordeza &mdash; I felt she was too young.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>7) &#8220;Violeta&rsquo;s grandmothers will be her guardians, and Kordeza and her daughter will receive about $115 a month in state benefits.&#8221;</p>

<p>No offense, but correctly predicting these people were Gypsies makes you about as &#8220;clairvoyant&#8221; as someone predicting the Sun will rise tomorrow.  ;-)</p>

		<p>I should hope that these people become Islamic so that their female youngsters will be swaddled head-to-toe in veils.</p>
<p>And the nineteen year-old hero who saved her? Perhaps the chances that he would impregnate her would be lessened a bit if she were so swaddled.</p>

		<p>Of course they are Roma.  bulgarians are mostly quite advanced.  One of the few good legacies of communism was a large educated population in that region with very little religious affiliation.  If their non-roma demographics were not so miserable they would be a huge asset to europe in the future.</p>

		<p>Dida is aged 55 and is the Grandmother of Kordeza. However, this latest birth makes her a great-grandmother. Simple maths show this family is producing children at a median age of 13 years 9 months.<br>
This indicates sexual activity at around 13 years of age so perhaps Dida is quite correct in saying Kordeza is just a tad young to have her first child, after all, tradition must be followed.</p>

<p>In Bulgaria the Roma are either/both Muslim / Bulgarian Orthodox.</p>
<p>In Selo Pobeda, outside Dobrich, the Muslim section of the only village cemetery - the village having a population of 1,000 - is said to be Roma.</p>
<p>However, in Bulgaria the Roma treat religion with a rather light touch - their superstitions and ritual curses are far more important, but they enjoy being blessed by Imams and Priests [the joke being that other family members are industriously engaged in picking his pockets and draining the gas from his car while he&rsquo;s busy performing religious rites.]</p>
