<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5AF0AG20091116">African Immigrants Drift Toward Latin America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luis Andres Henao, Reuters, November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stowed away on cargo ships and unsure where their dangerous journeys will take them, increasing numbers of African immigrants are arriving in Latin America as European countries tighten border controls.</p>
<p>Some head to Mexico and Guatemala as a stepping stone to the United States, others land in the ports of Argentina and Brazil. Though many arrive in Latin America by chance, once in the region they find governments that are more welcoming than in Europe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Brazil, Africans are now the largest refugee group, representing 65 percent of all asylum seekers, according to the Brazil&rsquo;s national committee for refugees.</p>
<p>There are now more than 3,000 African immigrants living in Argentina, up from just a few dozen eight years ago. The number of asylum seekers each year has risen abruptly, to about 1,000 a year, and a third of them are African.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is still low compared to the tens of thousands of immigrants who make the journey to Europe each year, but Africans are expected to come to Latin America in increasing numbers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For many, their journey starts by dodging port controls in Africa and then surviving on water and biscuits for weeks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>VISAS AND CLASSES</p>
<p>Millions of Europeans arrived in South America aboard ships in the 19th century escaping poverty and war, while Africans arrived on slave ships to work on Brazil&rsquo;s vast sugar cane plantations.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Africans might arrive on cargo ships or commercial planes and then seek asylum or overstay tourist visas. In Argentina, they can obtain temporary work visas shortly after arriving and renew them every three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The migratory policies of the country are very favorable,&#8221; said Manzanares. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a reflection of history. What happened with European immigrants 100 years ago is now happening with African immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africans in Argentina can also obtain free health services and some take Spanish lessons taught by Catholic charities.</p>
<p>Many eventually settle here, marry, or become Argentine citizens. Some Africans who have arrived legally have managed to work as musicians and a few others play professional soccer for local clubs. The majority earn a living selling jewelry on the streets of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now increasing numbers of immigrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo are escaping violence and civil war back home and seeking asylum in Brazil, which can be an easy country for African immigrants to adapt to because it has the largest black population outside of Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adaptation process is really good in Brazil,&#8221; said Carolina Montenegro of UNHCR in Brazil. &#8220;For Africans it tends to be easier because of this cultural heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more immigrants from Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia are also making their way to Mexico and Central America via cargo ships, hoping to eventually reach the United States over land.</p>
<p>The number of Africans passing through the detention center in Tapachula, a city near Mexico&rsquo;s southern border, was more than 600 last year, three times as many as in 2007.</p>

		<p>In a world of easy transportation and instant communication, race realism is needed more urgently than ever.  Such a world, left to its own devices, will deteriorate as the least desirable genes migrate to escape the misery that they themselves created.  Latin America is squalid, but it is better than Africa - so Africans migrate there.  Very few Latin Americans will migrate to Africa; after all, it is inhabited by less advanced people and thus has less advanced societies.  Meanwhile, Latin Americans migrate to North America.  In the end, the entire world will become one big Africa.  This is destined to happen and nothing can stop it - except a healthy dose of race realism and draconian measures to protect the societies created by People of Light.</p>

		<p>Unlike Mexico, Guatemala and other mostly non-white Latin American countries, Argentina is primarily white. Most Argentinians are of Spanish or Italian descent. It also has the highest birth rate of all white countries: 2.35 children born per woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Africans in Argentina can also [EXPLOIT] free health services and some take Spanish lessons taught by Catholic charities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, these African &#8220;refugees&#8221; know this information, so they flock to Argentina, hoping to exploit the white man&rsquo;s generosity and altruistic spirit, which cannot be found in any non-white Latin American nation.</p>
<p>Hopefully these so-called refugees will stir up enough pandemonium so that the Argentinians will kick these free loaders out of their country.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many people think this story is true? It&rsquo;s skewed or simply a fairy tale at worst. I swear I am at the point where I believe the &#8220;home office&#8221;, under direction of the elites, simply tosses these stories out there in order to make whites feel as if the rising dark tide will abate, that the non-whites will seek out their own, just decide to go elsewhere. It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. Just like the Great Somali Welfare Hunt (mentioned elsewhere on this site) the dark folks go where whitey is generally forced to hand out money, housing, food. </p>

<p>&#8220;More welcoming than in Europe?&#8221;  HA!  Nonsense.  There isn&rsquo;t a country in South America that would welcome blacks, including Brazil, or should I say, ESPECIALLY Brazil, because they have a serious black crime and violence problem right now.</p>
<p>This was written by a Hispanic.  I&rsquo;m guessing&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m right&hellip;.this Hispanic reporter wants to create the impression that Hispanics are more tolerant.</p>
<p>If, anything, they&rsquo;re far less tolerant than the decadent white countries, and the people regard blacks as inferior.</p>

<p>Laughably, that about totals the sum of 99.9% of Africans&rsquo; full global value. They are almost utterly worthless; and that 0.01% that produces anything remotely resembling something of value, either involves strangely rhythmic and equally discordant chanted gibberish, or chasing some orb made of hides or plastics across a field. What has become of these ebony space-faring pyramid builders?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is now not enough to simply infect the northern areas of the earth with such enrichments. Those areas of the southern hemisphere, where Western Civilization seemed to miraculously remain unscathed, now are targeted as well for the same infectious enrichments.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>South America is more tolerant of Africans than Europe?  Either Europe has shifted dramatically to the right in the past couple of years or every South American I know is not representative of their home country.  I have several (white) Columbian friends who will not even eat at a restaurant if &#8220;the dark people&#8221; are working there.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Q&#8221; makes a very valid point, to wit, that most of these African immigrants to Latin America merely view the South or Central American country of their choice as an interim point of arrival to the US.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet that at least 80% of them ultimately will attempt to migrate to the US, and perhaps half that number will succeed.</p>

		<p>Europe is still the preferred choice of Africans for their chance of fleeing what they themselves have created or which they also call home. The African is not welcome in Europe other than by the usual groups that either live in a world of make believe or the factor cheap labor is in play. Europe has another problem the demographic disaster caused by the lack of births has caused the color blind European elite to invite Africans to replace the Europeans that are simply not being born. Those that know what happened in the &#8220;New World&#8221; or America as a result of us African labor are aghast but most in Europe have not concluded or understand that ghettos with all its &#8220;charm&#8221; and the arrival of Africans in Europe are one and the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sea lanes of the South Atlantic have become a favored route for drug traffickers carrying narcotics from Latin America to West and North Africa, where al Qaeda-related groups are increasingly involved in transporting the drugs to Europe, intelligence officials and counter-narcotics specialists say. &#8221; </p>

		<p>I agree with most of the posters here.  This is nothing but MSM double speak.  The most obvious question is, why would they go to poor countries with governments who are stingy with their money, when they could go to rich western countries whose governments encourage freebie giveaways to new arrivals?  Answer: They wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>  I wouldn&rsquo;t count on any new trend here. Latin America will be a stepping stone for eventual immigration to the United States. In my entire college career I&rsquo;ve known precious few African students to ever return to their home countries. I suspect that some Visa jumpers would even become quite violent if forced to leave &ldquo;racist&rdquo; America. </p>

<p>Source? 86.4% of Argentina&rsquo;s population self-identify as European descent. An estimated 8% of the population is mestizo, and a further 4% of Argentinians were of Arab or East Asian heritage.</p>
<p>2- Average composition of the Argentine genome (Avena et al., 2006)</p>
<p>79.9 % of European contribution, 15.8% Amerindian and 4.3% African.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t matter!   These countries are a mere steping stone to North America. The authorities there wouldn&rsquo;t care one way or another, as long as these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are merely passing thru, on their way to the United States and Canada.  These people are going to become OUR problem, not Mexico&rsquo;s.  Mexico would be delighted to see Uncle Sam&rsquo;s problems multiply.  As long as those problems don&rsquo;t settle down and remain in Mexico!  (But they won&rsquo;t.  Mexico won&rsquo;t stand for them.)</p>
<p>As JAY said, without draconian controls in this age of easy transportation, eventually the whole world  will become one big Africa.</p>
