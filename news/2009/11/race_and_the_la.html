<h1><a href="/ar/1994/06/index.html#article1">Race and the Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marian Evans, American Renaissance, June 1994</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are signs that the law is slowly beginning to acknowledge that blacks are more violent and dangerous than whites. The most dramatic example of this was an unprecedented defense used in a murder trial in Fort Worth, Texas in April.</p>
<p>In most respects, the crime was perfectly ordinary. A 17-year-old black man, Daimion Osby, was rolling dice with some other young black men. Mr. Osby won a $400 pot and promptly left the game. This violated dicing etiquette, which requires that big winners stay in the game and give others a chance to win back their money.</p>
<p>One of the heavy losers, Marcus Brooks, vowed to &#8220;get&#8221; Mr. Osby. Some time afterwards, Mr. Brooks, with help form a cousin, attacked Mr. Osby at a basketball game, and the fight was broken up by police. On another occasion, when Mr. Osby was stopped at a traffic light, Mr. Brooks and his cousin pulled up beside him, waved a shotgun at him, and ordered him to pull over. Mr. Osby sped away and escaped.</p>
<p>Mr. Osby once again eluded his attackers after a meeting in a park, and decided that he should arm himself. He bought a .38 caliber revolver and three bullets, and started carrying the weapon in his pocket.</p>
<p>One evening, Mr. Osby was standing on the sidewalk talking to a woman. Mr. Brooks and his cousin were driving by, saw Mr. Osby, and drove up onto the sidewalk, bumping Mr. Osby. The two assailants got out of the car and attacked Mr. Osby, knocking him to the ground. Mr. Osby broke free and shot one of the men in the head. As the other made a dash for the car, where he kept a loaded handgun, Mr. Osby shot him, too, killing both men with single shots to the head.</p>
<p>Mr. Osby&rsquo;s public defenders argued that this was a justified, self-defense killing. The problem was that Texas law permits defensive use of lethal force only if a man has reason to believe that his life is in imminent danger. The lawyers decided to argue that because the assailants were black, Mr. Osby had particularly compelling reason to think his life was in danger.</p>
<p>The prosecution tried to prevent this testimony, but the defense was allowed to call an expert witness to explain to the jury the grisly facts about differential murder rates. The witness made a very simple case. He pointed out that men are about nine times more likely to commit murder than women, and it is appropriate to adjust defensive behavior according to the sex of an assailant. Men are more dangerous than women, so it is more reasonable to shoot a male attacker than a female attacker. He also explained that young men are far more dangerous than old men, and therefore pose a threat that can be more justifiably met with lethal force.</p>
<p>Finally, he pointed out that blacks are more than eight times more likely to commit murder than whites. This means that blacks are almost as much more dangerous than whites as men are more dangerous than women. Just as it is legitimate to fear men more than women and young men more than old men, it is legitimate to fear blacks more than whites. Mr. Osby faced two men who fit perfectly the profile of the most dangerous, violent people in America, and was therefore justified in using deadly force.</p>
<p>The defense seems to have been partly successful. The jury voted eleven-to-one to convict, but the jury foreman  &mdash;  one of two blacks on the panel  &mdash;  held out for acquittal. As he explained to journalists, Mr. Osby was right to be afraid and to think his life in danger. A hung jury is neither a conviction nor an acquittal, and the prosecution promises to try Mr. Osby again, probably in the fall. The defense plans to present the same expert testimony at the second trial.</p>
<p>There was outrage among Fort Worth blacks over this defense strategy, as there always is when unpleasant racial facts are aired. A group of preachers thundered that this defense would mean it was &#8220;open season&#8221; on young black men. Of course, young men of any race are more dangerous than old women, but this does not make it &#8220;open season&#8221; on them.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that Mr. Osby is black. The blacks-are-more-dangerous defense would be just as valid for whites as for blacks, but in the current climate of racial hysteria, it would probably backfire on a white defendant. Nevertheless, it is an important milestone for a court officially to permit testimony explaining that blacks are a greater threat to society than whites.</p>
<p>In other, less direct ways, racial realities may begin shaping the law. There is support in some quarters for permitting police searches without warrants in certain housing projects. Residents would agree to the searches as a condition for living in subsidized apartments. The American Civil Liberties Union seems to have stopped this plan for the time being, but no one imagines warrantless searches of buildings full of whites or Asians.</p>
<p>Likewise, several months ago, the mayor of Washington, DC, Sharon Pratt Kelly, proposed that since crime had become such a problem in her city, the National Guard should be asked to help fight it. It is no coincidence that Washington is two-thirds black.</p>
<p>America is not a single society but several. Eventually the law may recognize this.<br>

		<p>The question in Mr. Osby&rsquo;s case is that, depending on Texas law, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the legal right to use deadly force to defend himself unless he had fled from the danger as far and as long as he could, called the &#8220;duty to retreat.&#8221;  The narrative here might not tell the whole story, but from what I read, it&rsquo;s really marginal.  Mr. Osby was on his back, but shot one of his rivals even though they weren&rsquo;t trying to shoot him.  That isn&rsquo;t the duty of retreat in my mind.  Now for the other man who ran toward to car, evidently to get a gun, who Mr. Osby shot on the way to the car, that&rsquo;s really marginal   &mdash;   you could make the case either way that the second man&rsquo;s quick running to the car was morally tantamount to the man using deadly force against Mr. Osby, because we all know why the second man was running to the car.  But on the flip side of that coin, the second man was not actually pointing a gun at Mr. Osby, and therefore, in the time differential, he could have ran from the scene.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure there was outrage among blacks. For them, the idea of average citizens being able to protect themselves is a direct slap to the face, and an insult to their &#8216;blackness&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t be expecting the paper to investigate this aspect of racial attitudes. Did they?</p>

		<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not like this started a trend.  In the early 90&rsquo;s, there was a belief among racially conscious conservatives that racial differences were about to become acceptable to discuss in mainstream political discourse.  It didn&rsquo;t happen of course.  </p>

		<p>Some of these self-defense stories work like a charm, as they should? I&rsquo;ve even seen a case, of a small store owner, shooting a criminal in the back as the perp was getting away, where the crime victim literally got away with murder. Maybe this is a case where citizens concerned with the first amendment and even america should rally to the cause of Mr. Osby? After all, the man is even black. You can&rsquo;t be morally wrong if you&rsquo;re black. Half the battle is won already here. 3/4ths.  </p>

<p>I doubt if Mr. Osby really was defending himself. The idea of a guy fearing for his life and making two head shots for kills is a little suspicious. This sounds as if he were making a preemtive first strike before they could even think about &#8220;getting him&#8221;. That idea of black men being more dangerous  could work both ways when the defendant is black, he may have made the prosecution&rsquo;s case for them. </p>
<p>He could have used the &#8220;I thought I was shooting white people defense&#8221; and got away with it. </p>

<p>There was back then. The &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; and &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; laws are quite recent. Nor was concealed carry legal in Texas at the time. Getting CCW through the legislature c. 1995 was the one good thing George W. Bush did as governor.</p>
<p>I was living in Arlington in 1994 and remember this case well. The lawyer labeled his client&rsquo;s act a case of &#8220;urban survival syndrome.&#8221; Today a good lawyer could accomplish the same thing just by quoting from <i>The Color of Crime</i>.</p>

		<p>generalquagmyer, the amount of money is irrelevant.  They might have been offended by a look. The fact is, they hounded the kid repeatedly, on one occasion threatening him with a shotgun.  I would also arm myself.  </p>
<p>The legal requirement for imminent deadly danger is the problem.  In my own opinion, that&rsquo;s a defect in the law.  I see no moral reason why any person should submit to a beating rather than defend himself to the full extent of his abllity.</p>
<p>Consider for yourself; you&rsquo;re armed, you are attacked by two bigger unarmed men.  No excuse for shooting them, so you don&rsquo;t. So they take your gun away from you.  Now they are armed, and you are not.  <em>Now</em> you can legally shoot them. Oops!</p>

		<p>I think the main point of this article is that the American legal and justice system, and the greater society and culture that begets the legal system, is schizophrenic.  On the one hand, the races are equal, and therefore anything other than race and racial differences is the explanation for black men being so violent.  On the other hand, blacks can be excused in marginal self-defense cases because black men are inherently violent.</p>
<p>There are many other examples like this.  There&rsquo;s supposed be no such thing as IQ, and certainly no such thing as racial differences in IQ.  But IQ (and racial differences therein) come into play in the minds of Supreme Court Justices when it comes to executing murderers whose IQ is a little low.  IQ and race all of a sudden existed, when SSI was the fastest growing line item in the federal budget between the 1996 Welfare Reform and 9/11   &mdash;   what happened in that time period is that many blacks that would have been forced off the welfare programs that were &#8220;reformed&#8221; switched to SSI, based on the pretense that their black children are &#8220;retarded.&#8221;  Even though there&rsquo;s no such thing as IQ or racial differences therein, right?</p>
