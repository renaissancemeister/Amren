<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=115923">Ayers, Dohrn Accuse Hillary of &#8216;White Supremacy&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Klein, WorldNetDaily, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 2008 campaign for the Democrat nomination deliberately appealed to white supremacy, fear and anxiety, charged longtime Barack Obama colleague and Weatherman terrorist William Ayers and wife, Bernardine Dohrn.</p>
<p>In a co-authored article in the socialist Monthly Review magazine, the two radicals argued last year&rsquo;s national elections had &#8220;racist&#8221; undertones and that President Obama&rsquo;s ascent to power can be used to &#8220;build a new society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[Hillary] Clinton flagrantly appealed to white voters&rsquo; identity as &#8216;workers&rsquo; or &#8216;women&rsquo;  &mdash;  offering white people any reason to vote against Obama without saying he&rsquo;s black  &mdash;  and followed the ancient and dismal road of racial discourse that appeals to white supremacy, fear and anxiety,&#8221; wrote Ayers and Dohrn.</p>
<p>The two referenced a New York Times opinion piece by feminist activist Gloria Steinem, &#8220;Women are Never Front-Runners,&#8221; written on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. Steinem argued the gender barrier had not yet been broken and asked, &#8220;Why is the sex barrier not taken as seriously as the racial one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayers and Dohrn charged Steinem had asserted a &#8220;superior victim status on the part of white, powerful women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duo went on to claim the 2008 presidential elections had racist undertones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invisible race talk was about &#8216;blue collar&rsquo; or &#8216;working class&rsquo; or &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; or &#8216;small town&rsquo; or &#8216;hockey mom&rsquo; or &#8216;Joe the plumber,&rsquo; but we were meant to think &#8216;white,&rsquo;&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Continued Ayers and Dohrn: &#8220;All the talk of Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s exotic background, all the references to him as &#8216;unknown, &#8216;untested,&rsquo; a &#8216;stranger,&rsquo; or a &#8216;symbolic candidate,&rsquo; or &#8216;alien,&rsquo; a &#8216;wildcard,&#8220;&#8216;or an &#8216;elitist.&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The discourse was all about race, us and them, understood by everyone in the United States even when the words African American, black or white are not spoken.&#8221;</p>

		<p>My, my, even the most far-left White liberals aren&rsquo;t immune from being tarred with the &#8220;Racist&#8221; brush.  You&rsquo;d think that liberals would learn, wouldn&rsquo;t you?  But no, they always think that it&rsquo;s only <i>other</i> Whites who&rsquo;ll be called &#8220;Racist Haters,&#8221; while they themselves bask in the self-righteous glory of their own Inclusive Multiculturalism.  Lap it up, Hillary   &mdash;   you&rsquo;ve got it coming.</p>

		<p>I could only wish that this feminist vs black intranicene squabble within the Democrat Party would manifest itself by whatever side that loses not voting, but it wasn&rsquo;t the case   &mdash;   former HRC supporters voted for Obama last November almost monolithically.  And I&rsquo;m sure that if HRC had beaten Obama for the D-nomination, blacks would have voted for HRC last November by the same margins they did for Obama, though not quite as many of them.  She would have won the election over McCain anyway because of the economy.</p>

This reminds me of &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;. You can&rsquo;t see it, touch it, taste it, hear it, or smell it but it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;All the talk of Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s exotic background, all the references to him as &lsquo;unknown, &lsquo;untested,&rsquo; a &lsquo;stranger,&rsquo; or a &lsquo;symbolic candidate,&rsquo; or &lsquo;alien,&rsquo; a &lsquo;wildcard,&ldquo;&lsquo;or an &lsquo;elitist.&rsquo; &hellip; The discourse was all about race, us and them, understood by everyone in the United States even when the words African American, black or white are not spoken.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Goodness. How many words were supposed to be off limits when referring to then Senator Obama?</p>
<p>Mr. Ayers would score high on the racist test. He seems to attribute negative words with blacks.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that the only writing these reprehensible terrorists deserve to be doing is scribbling postcards from a Supermax penitentiary, Ayers&rsquo; and Dohrn&rsquo;s arguments are predictably paranoid commie nonsense. It is the output of minds both shallow and twisted. </p>
<p>In their zeal to name-and-shame-and-blame &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; <i>even within the Democratic Party</i>, Obama&rsquo;s bomb-tossing buddies have proven themselves even more racist against caucasians than The Grand Mulatto himself. </p>
<p>And that takes some doing!</p>

&ldquo;white,&rdquo;&rsquo; they wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While accusing Hillary Clinton of  &ldquo;white supremacy&rdquo; is absurd, there is absolutely no doubt that she was directly appealing to white primary voters in her battle with Comrade BO in 2008. However, all she demonstrated by doing this, was to prove that she has twice the brains and political acumen of the repulsive traitor that is John McCain. It was a sound strategy for her as he had the minority votes locked up; her folly and fault, along with that of her husband (as both have dominated the Democratic Party for close to two decades,) was encouraging the party to become 50% or less white in the first place. They are as guilty as anyone, in making a fetish of diversity and canonizing multiculturalism in that party. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Hillary Clinton was using a sort of reverse Nixon strategy in 2008, within the framework of the Democratic primary. Richard Nixon made a point of  directly appealing to white voters in both 1968 and 1972, only to sell them out when he got into the White House. Hillary and her husband did this backwards, as they have been sticking it to &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; their entire political careers, and then had the gall to appeal to them when it became politically expedient for them to do so in 2008.</p>
<p>Death by multiculturalism is never pleasant, as Hillary now understands to the very bottom of her soul!</p>

		<p>These people want to claim, on the one hand, that race is a &#8220;social construct&#8221; and doesn&rsquo;t otherwise exist, and, on the other, that the election was actually a clear case of racial politics!</p>
<p>The very fact that such an article needs to be written at all is an indication that race is a natural (and for most, inevitable)consideration for all normal people, White or Black or Asian, etc.</p>

Although I don&rsquo;t have a degree in biology I enjoy reading difficult and esoteric material on biology and medicine.  Ayers and Dhorn by contrast seems to enjoy taking the simple: Barack Obama&rsquo;s race is important, and turn it into an incoherent and rambling diatribe.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have to be lunatic to understand what Ayers and Dhorn are writing, or failed freshman comp a few times.  It&rsquo;s no wonder America is going down the tubes, I would be appauled if a ninth grader wrote like this.  </p>
<p>Dhorn and Ayers are bad incoherent writers.  It&rsquo;s shocking to think this fellow ghost wrote Obama&rsquo;s bio.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how many strange and weird tangents he must have branched off to in Obama&rsquo;s bio.  Has anyone read the Obama book and does it bear the slightest resemblence to this long winded and pointless diatribe?</p>

		<p>Boy, there&rsquo;s no leftist fool like an old leftist fool! It must be bizarre, as a white person, to go through life this way - to hate your own kind so passionately, and to forever identify only with those so alien, so unlike yourself. One wonders what unpleasantness might have in happened in their childhood, or what it is that fuels this racial self-loathing to this degree. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just so pathetic</p>

<p>Thinking out loud here, I wonder if HRC would have played, as you call it, the reverse Nixon strategy earlier in the primaries, if she would have won the nomination.  She would have become President, mainly b/c any Democrat was going to win last Nov. in those conditions, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have the indignity of having a black President, even if their ideology his almost identical.</p>
<p>In the primaries, BHO vs HRC, BHO won the state primaries and caucuses of states that are either very black or hardly black.  In very black states, (e.g. MS) almost all the whites are Republicans, mainly to spite the blacks.  Therefore, a D-primary in MS is heavily black, therefore Obama wins.  In a hardly black states, whites haven&rsquo;t experienced blacks, and therefore buy &#8220;our diversity is our strength&#8221; like snake oil, and vote Obama over HRC. </p>
<p>HRC generally won states that had percentages of black population close to the national average.  In those states, there are enough blacks to give enough white people the experience, but not so many that there can&rsquo;t be any white Democrats.  Therefore, in those states, you had enough white Democrat voters who:  (1) Didn&rsquo;t like blacks, but (2) Were Democrats anyway b/c it&rsquo;s the family or labor union thing to do.  That was HRC&rsquo;s margin of victory in states like OH and PA. </p>

<p>Are we supposed to pretend that Obama didn&rsquo;t flagrantly appeal to blacks&rsquo; racial identity?  You should see the racial triumphalism among blacks selling Obama paraphernalia in New York City.  When Obama told an immigrant Indian engineer, &#8220;You are the future!&#8221; do you think he wasn&rsquo;t telling us whites that we are the past?</p>
<p>Tell me, why oh why wasn&rsquo;t terrorist Ayers sent to the electric chair decades ago?<br>

		<p>If the immigrant Indian is &#8220;our future&#8221;, as BHO reassured him, then the U.S.A. has no future. The nation was created by, and for, individuals from Britain and Europe. Since 1965, the country has declined severely and yet not one politician has the courage to state why. We all know why, and now that non-Europeans are overwhelming this once-White land, the decline has been staggering, enfuriating, and saddening.</p>
<p>That immigrant isn&rsquo;t the future. He&rsquo;s part of the ruination.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious.  If any kind of objection to Barack Obama is considered &#8220;racist&#8221;, just how do they expect Hillary to have run her campaign?  Did they expect any and all white contenders to just throw in the towel and concede the election due to the fact that Obama is black?  Apparently so - and it turns out that is essentially what McCain did.</p>

		<p>If one acknowledges that different races display different characteristics, from temperament, physical size and appearance, intellect, in short, the self-evident truth, then one is is a racist.</p>
<p>Only if one strenuously denies the truth can one not be a racist.</p>
<p>Of course, being a racist is the most horrible and reprehensible of all thought crimes, but only caucasians can be truly regarded as racists, though East Asians are starting to break through the white monopoly on racism, with their often frank observations that black Africans are clearly less intelligent than other races. But they still earn a bit of a pass on the issue, since they regards us as inferior as well, God bless them.</p>

		<p>BHO won by monopolizing the black vote and then working out from there.  HRC tried to do the exact same thing only from the women&rsquo;s view point.  Clearly blood was thicker than water.  </p>

<p>The&rsquo;re not concerned about blacks, Tom, of course.  They are concerned about Anglo-Americans.  They hate them and anybody who agrees with them.</p>
<p>If this country comprised a non-white power structure who had the same exact history and country as whites, then we wouldn&rsquo;t hear a peep out of them.</p>
<p>They like to think of themselves as part of the leftist intelligencia, but what they really are is part of America&rsquo;s airhead radicals who very seldom are able to reason and logic in intelligent terms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no more than demented mindless zombies who were brainwashed into an anti-white mental mode, and they have been slaves to their hatred their entire lives.</p>
<p>That a university hired them says volumes about its legitimacy and its narrow-minded and biased position on traditional America.  They like what Ayers and Dohrn did, and they agree with their rabid hatred of white America, otherwise they would be treated as any other criminal.</p>
<p>Their complaints don&rsquo;t involve justice for blacks.  They involve abject hatred of whites. Both of them are excellent examples of how a propaganda machine can twist the thoughts and ideoiogy of weak-minded people.<br>

		<p>To a small extent, Barack Obama, or to put it more accurately, David Axelrod, used a little bit of what John PM calls the &#8220;reverse Nixon&#8221; strategy.  The strategy was to lower the margin of victory for John McCain within heavily red counties in swing and otherwise red states.  For example, you know that McCain was going to win counties like Greene and St. Charles in Missouri, but if you fake some populism, you&rsquo;ll finish within 10 points in those counties.  That will help you in your attempt to win the state overall, which he almost did in MO, and indeed won the rest of the swing states and a few surprises like IN and NC.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Any white man or woman who thinks he or she can escape attack by political triangulation on the subject of race should take heed: if Hillary Clinton, after decades of public pandering, can be accused of racism, then any white can be accused of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news is that such overt abuse of the term has to eventually lead to its complete of the term.  That devaluation is far over-due in my opinion.  I keep waiting for the media to begin to reflect a bit of weariness on this issue, but all it seems to do is become even more extreme.  But I think the average person, and especially young people, are beginning to notice the ridiculousness of all the pro-black and anti-white pandering out there.  To me it seems that one has to be brain dead to not notice the farce of all this&hellip; </p>

		<p>Why else did she send her daughter to Sidwell Friends School instead of a DC public school? </p>
<p>Because as has been pointed out, she is smart!! she also had some desire to see her children SURVIVE school.</p>

		<p>Two radical weathermen SDS bombers trying to kill innocents and we &#8220;listen to them.&#8221;  Wish they had blown themselves up&hellip;or better yet send to Afghan as sacrifices.  The wonderful Casey Islamists will know what to do.</p>

		<p>John  &mdash;  &#8220;If one acknowledges that different races display different characteristics, from temperament, physical size and appearance, intellect, in short, the self-evident truth, then one is is a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Replace race with sex and you&rsquo;re a sexist, too.  It&rsquo;s all about this myth of &#8220;universal equality.&#8221;  If you acknowledge differences between the races or between the sexes, you&rsquo;re a racist or a sexist.</p>

<p>Good grief!  If you think Dohrn is a WASP, you haven&rsquo;t a clue what&rsquo;s going on. (And probably Ayers doesn&rsquo;t either!) <br>

		<p>To Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>If I not mistaken, the Obamas also sent their daughters to Sidwell Friends.</p>
<p>I guess they figured sending them black girls to a D.C. public school was akin to throwing raw, red meat to a hungry wolfpack.</p>
<p>Hypocrites!</p>
