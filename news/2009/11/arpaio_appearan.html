<h1>Arpaio Appearance at ASU Sparks Outcry</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Gonzalez, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), November 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some Arizona State University students say Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio doesn&rsquo;t deserve to speak at a First Amendment forum later this month at the journalism school because they say Arpaio does not tolerate dissent. </p>
<p>They plan to protest the Nov. 30 event by demonstrating outside the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication building in downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>Some students also plan to protest silently inside the event by wearing duct tape over their mouths, symbolizing Arpaio&rsquo;s efforts to &#8220;intimidate&#8221; critics of his controversial immigration sweeps, said Sandra Castro, 21, a senior at ASU studying history and justice studies.</p>
<p>Last year, sheriff&rsquo;s deputies charged six people with disorderly conduct who were part of a group that peacefully tried to get the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to investigate the conduct of the sheriff&rsquo;s office and its use of funds in relation to the raids. The six were later acquitted of the charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t feel he is fit to speak at an ASU forum,&#8221; Castro said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not make sense for an institution designed to educate to provide a stage for such ignorance,&#8221; the fliers say.</p>
<p>The students also created a Facebook page dedicated to opposing Arpaio&rsquo;s appearance: https://tinyurl.com/ygqhdnc</p>

		<p>I find it funny that the students are not allowing Sheriff Arpaio to speak, the more so since they are refusing under the premise that he does not allow &#8220;dissent&#8221;. Aren&rsquo;t they disallowing dissent as well through this refusal?</p>
<p>And what, exactly, is Justice Studies? Is this just another affirmative action degree? If Senorita Castro is studying so-called Justice studies, should she not be welcoming Arpaio&rsquo;s appearance, since he is in fact enforcing the law of the land?<br>

		<p>Liberal brainwashed studends who are too stupid to recoginize a real American. Sheriff Joe is a hero from the old school of people who love America and believe illegal aliens should not be allowed to enter the country and exploit America&rsquo;s bounty while hating America and  portraying themselves as victims because they are not granted immediate amnesty.  We are in an upside down society with an upside down president who also hates the values of America and his hell bent to change them.  We are in dangerous times!</p>

<p>Sheriff Joe is certainly &#8216;fit&rsquo; to speak at any forum at ASU, any time, on any subject one could pick.</p>
<p>If Castro is intimidated by Sheriff Joe, she may have a hard time dealing with the real world once she is out and about.  Funny how that works&hellip;</p>

		<p>A lot of lefties and others seem to forget that this is a public university, hence Arizona STATE.  Sheriff Arpaio is a law enforcement officer.  All it would take is for state legislators or the governor to threaten to defund ASU, and my how quickly their tune would change.  But most Republicans don&rsquo;t have the spine to play hardball with the far left.</p>

		<p>The duct tape sounds like a good idea.  It sure beats students donning quasi-military garb and marching up and down the aisles blowing shrill whistles or screaming, like some of the culturally left-wing loons do during conservative speeches on campus.</p>

		<p>More undeniable proof the left opposes free speech.  Only those with identical points of view are suitable to the lefties.</p>
<p>As with the adl and the hate crime agenda, free speech is against the law.  </p>
