<h1>Too Lazy in Halifax to Work?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Maher, Chronicle Herald (Halifax), November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If anyone ever stops Nova Scotia farmers from hiring migrant labourers to harvest their crops, they would destroy a lot of businesses because unemployed Nova Scotians don&rsquo;t want those jobs, says Gerald Keddy, the Conservative MP for South Shore-St. Margarets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nova Scotians won&rsquo;t do it  &mdash;  all those no-good bastards sitting on the sidewalk in Halifax that can&rsquo;t get work,&#8221; Mr. Keddy said Monday.</p>
<p>He said if you want to &#8220;shut down the Annapolis Valley, and every market garden operation and all the apple industry, then don&rsquo;t bring in immigrant labour. We&rsquo;ve got 20 Christmas tree growers using immigrant labour this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Keddy was upset that a reporter called to check out a rumour that he had hired migrant labourers to work on his Christmas tree operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would the question be asked?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why would it matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Keddy has an eight-hectare Christmas tree operation, which he runs with his kids. They don&rsquo;t bring in any migrant labourers, but Mr. Keddy said nobody should criticize farmers who do because &#8220;they can&rsquo;t get enough local labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also great for the workers from out of the country, he said. &#8220;They pay the guys 10 or 12 bucks an hour. It&rsquo;s a great job for the Mexicans. They&rsquo;ve got to pay either their way up or their way back. It&rsquo;s not slave labour here.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I have always wondered about when big business will apply their own standards of &#8220;supply and demand&#8221; to workers pay.</p>
<p>If you cannot get workers at $X per hour, then the supply is down and the price has to rise.</p>
<p>But they use immigrant labour to lower the labour price&hellip; Which would be fair.. IF they sell their products at third world prices.</p>
<p>This is the schizophrenic nature on business - wanting to pay third world wages and charge first world prices - It cannot go on too long before the wealth of the citizenry is stripped and the entire system collapses..</p>
<p>Hang on&hellip; It IS collapsing!!!</p>

<p>Instead of advertising labor jobs in Mexico or with immigrant labor pools, I&rsquo;d bet if they advertised jobs locally, they might get some locals.</p>

<p>When the west becomes the same over-crowded, resource depleted, violent, crime ridden hell hole as the countries these immigrants flee, they&rsquo;ll stop coming. </p>

		<p>Ten to twelve bucks an hour is a very good wage for unskilled labor.  Able bodied Whites who are too good to do physical work can all go starve.  Kick out the foreigners and cut off the welfare too.  We have no use for Whites who act like ghetto Blacks.  </p>

		<p>The problem of not finding local folks to work the fields is the same all over not just in Canada. Pay the people that are supposed to do the work a wage they can support themselves with and you will find plenty of help. Paying a man / woman ten dollars an hour is not enough to survive on especially after the tax man is through with you. <br>
Here in Germany farm hands get about 8 euros an hour for their hard earned pay but it only works because the Poles go back home to spend their money where a euro goes a long way. A German worker cannot live off 8 euros an hour with the price of living as high as it is in Germany.</p>

		<p>Mmmm&hellip; Christmas trees and apples eh?? Sounds a lot like very seasonal work to me, not at all suited for full-time employees or full-time employment. Here in England we have a similar problem, flower picking in the South-West, cauliflowers in East Anglia and apples in Kent. All obviously seasonal so short periods of hectic employment but there is a local labour shortage for seasonal work in all these areas. Our wonderful Kafkaesque/Animal Farm &#8216;government&rsquo; certainly don&rsquo;t help. Even casual workers are to be accorded full-time employment conditions including holiday pay and maternity benefits! Ah yes, if an apple picker declares herself pregnant the first day of work, it could be deemed a danger to her unborn to stretch and pick so will be unable to continue but as there would be no suitable alternative work available, a replacement would be found and BOTH must be paid. As for temporary accommodation, no can do. Got to meet very strict minimum standards, most to suit the EU. Never mind that workers would happily live for a couple of weeks in a tent or caravan during their holidays, must have permanent housing with all mod-cons provided rent-free on the farm. So.. the obvious happens.. either a bunch of English students trying to raise money to pay for University fees that Gordon Brown provides for free in Scotland, or Eastern Europeans who are quite used to travelling around all over Europe doing exactly this kind of work continually. Quaffing beer or cider round a log fire and singing songs in the evening is jolly good fun and who cares about tents or caravans.. it&rsquo;s the same everywhere.. or kip down in a barn. This kind of work used to be done by itinerant gypsies who travel in their own homes. Sadly, no longer as now they have far more lucrative ways of making a fast quid or two!</p>

		<p>Regarding using immigrant labour to harvest crop, I have relatives who own a farm (not in Canada) who rely totally on immigrant labour to harvest crops. Unfortunately the return earned for their produce as dictated by large corporate supermarket chains is too low to allow for high wages to the workers picking those crop, i.e. the only way to make a successful business is to cost control wages to such an extent that a profit can be realised from the low prices paid by supermarkets for the produce, and the only people (generally) willing to work for such wages are immigrants of one form or another.</p>

		<p>It was reported to me that in one town in Atlantic Canada, they closed the fried chicken outlet because they couldn&rsquo;t hire employees to run it.</p>
<p>This is how it should be.  </p>
<p>The laws of economics shouldn&rsquo;t be bent or suspended for huge multi-national chain stores, but that&rsquo;s exactly why Filipinos, Mexicans, Chinese, Caribbeans and other assorted Third World immigrants are being invited to live in Canadian cities and towns.  They prop up an economic model based on enriching corporations while passing on the costs of policing, schooling and the health of migrants to the community.</p>

		<p>what&rsquo;s with the &#8220;raise a family&#8221; obsession that keeps coming up in discussion of wages? Not everybody has a family, guys! Many young men have no family and no hope to get one in any near future for economic reasons. Well, they need jobs too, and, if they got any sense and no better options, they will work for a low salary. Men married late in 19th century England because of general poverty, and today economic decline is leading us in the same direction. So we need to stop whining and start adapting, individually and collectively. Our competitors, the non-black non-whites, like Mexicans and Chinese, are already well adapted to such circumstances, so we have to wise up, in more ways than one. Doing low productivity work for low wages is not a wonderful thing, but life cannot always be wonderful.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just basic supply and demand. No farmer and no store are going to pay more wages as long as the cheap labor is plentifully.</p>
<p>No unemployed are going to take jobs as long as they have a welfare/unemployment check coming from the state. </p>

		<p>About ten years ago, the Indianapolis Star (our local fish wrap), ran a story about a farmer in Boone County (NW of Indianapolis) who couldn&rsquo;t get labor at almost any price to detassel and help harvest corn. It seems that the kids of Lebanon, Indiana preferred to drive 10 miles to the NW side of Indianapolis to flip burgers. Even if this guy paid twice as much, fast food is a lot easier than harvesting corn. They had plenty of choices about where to work (trust me, there is NO SHORTAGE OF CHAIN RESTAURANTS in the Indianapolis metro area (even in the hood)). I think this guy even tried renting a bus to bring in inner city kids (and you can imagine the train wreck that became of that idea). Granted, this was an era of 2-3% unemployment in the metro area. There were some Mexican migrants floating around, but nowhere near the number that now reside on the near-Westside of Indianapolis. </p>
<p>Now, if you lived in the boondocks, local unemployment is 15%, and there isn&rsquo;t an entire village of illegals nearby, Farmer Jones (or whatever his name was) wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem. You can be on West 86th street in Indianapolis from Lebanon in 15 minutes and East 82nd in 25 - 30. (On the Northside of Indianapolis, 86th St eventually merges into 82nd, and it is one big strip mall from west I-465 to I-69). I don&rsquo;t blame the kids for not taking those jobs when all of the fast food joints were screaming for decent labor. 99 times out of 100, Hunter, Zachary, and McKenzie are preferable to Antwan, DeAndre, and LaVetta.  However, I&rsquo;m in full agreement with Schoolteacher #7 about shutting off the welfare valves and letting knuckleheads starve or work, whatever their race. </p>

		<p>$10 or $12 an hour isn&rsquo;t so bad for unskilled labour and a single person can live reasonably well on it.</p>
<p>Canadian cities are full of people sitting on sidewalks asking for money, or getting in peoples&rsquo; faces to demand money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly white and native Indian.</p>

		<p>What farmers want-be they American or Canadian-are slaves. Farm work can ever be a high paying occuapation. No one really &#8220;volunteers&#8221; for farm work. You have to have to other options left in your life. Farm work is the last employment &#8220;option&#8221;. </p>
<p>The only solution is the massive mechanization of farm labor. Cheap immigrant  labor has postponed the complete inevitability of the mechanization of farm labor.</p>
<p>WHITE NATIONALIST are the good people on this planet:WE oppose both chattel slavery and wage slavery in America. This why we oppose giving agribusiness a massive wage subsidy in terms of post-1965 non-white immigrants. White Nationalist are in favor of severe labor scarcities because it will drive wages up and force the mechanization of jobs that bascially are jobs for slaves&hellip;and because it will also reverse the process of the mass race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE American and Canadian populations. </p>
<p>I can live without cheap degraded hispanic and haitian farm workers. How bout you Alexander Cockburn,Noam Chomsky and the whole cheap labor loving neoliberal economics profession embeded in US University System. These characters have no shame.</p>
<p>The Republican and Democratic policy of transfering massive amounts of wealth from ordinary NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS tothe greedy cheating class -Bill Gates,Meg Whitmann and MIT professor of linguistics Noam Chomsky-nice second home in CApe Cod-requires the massive import of post-1965 non-white labor into America. The ideology of race replacing-the blessings of diversity- the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS-is an attempt to justify this great crime against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>This evil economic system requires the complete race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN ANERICANS.</p>
<p>BEHIND EVERY GREAT FORTUNE IS A GREAT CRIME</p>

		<p>If a worker can pick an apple every ten seconds (seems pretty slow) then three cents more an apple would be ten dollars more an hour.</p>
<p>Right now, the grower couldn&rsquo;t get away with charging the wholesale buyer 3 cents more per apple ($3 more per bushel) but tighten up the apple supply by tightening up the labor market by tightening up immigration control, and the price goes up.</p>
<p>A lot of rural areas used to manage with local help - parts of Maine would close the schools for a week so teenagers could work the potato harvest.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have much luck googling typical apples picked per hour, but one patent application says 1000 lb/hour or 2000 apples.  One penny per apple = $20/ hour.  This consumer would certainly be willing to pay that cost passed along.</p>

		<p>Once again liberal lies.<br>
Immigrants- now matter how many work on farms or elsewhere are always more likely than native whites to be unemployed.  That&rsquo;s why the liberal West has brought in many laws against discrimination.<br>
Yet this simple contradiction is never mentioned on the TV or in the papers or anywhere else.<br>
They can&rsquo;t be BOTH indispensible hard workers AND the downtrodden poor and unemployed because of our evil racist society.<br>
There aren&rsquo;t enough jobs anymore because greedy big business has sent many jobs to the Third World so why do we need workers from the Third World?<br>
Adding more immigrants merely adds to the number of people competing for dwindling jobs.  Just because many succeed doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that overall they are poorer and more likely to be on benefits / welfare.<br>
Also, today&rsquo;s welfare state pays nearly as much as minimum wage so native or immigrant, black or white you&rsquo;ll will get far more laziness if your chances of getting a low paid unskilled unfulfilling job are reduced and you can just get the dole.<br>
In the UK some groups such as unemployed families are actually better off on welfare than working families.</p>

<p>I had it explained to me a number of years ago, by someone who owns a farm in Arkansas.  The illegals (in the case of Arkansas, Chicano Hispanics) tend to work hard once they first find some sort of job, but only as long as it takes for them to learn how to work the system, welfare and otherwise.  Then they stop working hard, and the cheap labor lusters have to import even more illegals to work hard until they learn to game the system.</p>

		<p>People (read: mostly blacks) won&rsquo;t pick produce for a living because it scarcely pays any more than welfare. Cut the welfare and you will suddenly find a flood of willing workers. For example, if welfare did not exist, many inner cities would now be virtual ghost towns. People used to pick up and move when there wasn&rsquo;t any work. Now they just sit on their behinds and collect welfare for generations. Anyone remember Grapes of Wrath? If people could travel cross country for work back then, they can do it now.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is curtailing illegal immigration. Those jobs might not pay so badly if they weren&rsquo;t here. Of course&hellip;the whole reason they are here is that welfare has lured millions of blacks away from menial labor. So maybe cutting government welfare (private charity is ok) is the answer to immigration, too. </p>
<p>As far as the supermarket chains go: they can demand cheap produce until they are blue in the face, but they can only get what the market will bear. And the only reason the market will bear such a low labor price right now is because we ignore illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>21 Anon: Has the White birthrate gone up so much, and the unemployment rate gone so low, that there are no more idle, single, young White men who have no families to support?  <br>
     As for those with families and bills to pay, oughtn&rsquo;t they settle for less rather than make no money at all?  If there are no high paying jobs available, then you take a low paying job.  Does the fact that I cannot afford prime rib every night mean that I refuse chicken?  <br>
     Let me guess.  These &#8220;Whites&#8221; are getting welfare, and they&rsquo;d rather mooch off productive Whites than endure the shame of getting their hands dirty.  Employers can smell their kind.  When it comes time to hire people, most bosses will choose someone who spent the last year picking fruit or sweeping floors than some slacker who sat around and took something for nothing.  How hard is picking apples?  It&rsquo;s just labor, that&rsquo;s all.  </p>

That&rsquo;s a despicable lie.  The main cause of non-whites coming to white societies has always been greedy rich people looking for cheap labor. </p>

		<p>Excellent point Question Diversity.<br>
I expect that&rsquo;s true here in UK.  Also, immigrants, especially illegals often have to work until they actually are entitled to benefits.<br>
And it costs more to run a largely non English speaking school in poor diverse areas than a poor white school etc.  More delays and costs in the workplace with language and cultural barriers.</p>
<p>The obvious solution, again never mentioned is stop mass immigration and make work compulsory.  IE make it compulsory for employers to hire natives only and compulsory for the unemployed to accept work.  Those who are left behind can do compulsory work for the country.  How much could be achieved if our govts got the labour surplus to replant trees, clear up recycling mountains, paperwork backlogs, rebuild and reopen for example Britains long neglected railway system which was reduced by 2/3 in the 60s to make people buy cars.  All these people would acquire skills and fulfillment and save the economy billions.<br>
It&rsquo;s so obvious.  We&rsquo;d all have pride in our countries again.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Let me guess. These &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; are getting welfare, and they&rsquo;d rather mooch off productive Whites than endure the shame of getting their hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand, there is NO POINT in working just to be paid less then you would get with welfare/unemployment. They make the act of looking for the job and keep collecting checks. They get free health care, free food, and huge amount of free time to make money under the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;what&rsquo;s with the &ldquo;raise a family&rdquo; obsession that keeps coming up in discussion of wages? Not everybody has a family, guys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone is a stay at home loser living in their parents basement either.</p>

		<p>When I was young I did lots of farm work and there was no labor shortage. Why there wasn&rsquo;t a labor shortage.</p>
<p>In years past there were lots of small farmers and they all had kids that helped to work the family farm. These small farmers went broke trying to compete with the larger more industrialized operations. Not many of these small family farms exist today. </p>
<p>So now you have an industry that needs lot of labor for a short peroid of time and is subsidized by the goverment in the form of cheap labor paid for by the tax payers. Sure the farmers may pay $10-$12 an hour to the immigrants but just how much of this money stays in the community to build roads and schools or to finance a police force or fire department. The locals still provide this money.</p>
<p>Farmers were run off their property by a goverment to provide cheap labor in the mines, factories and mills of the indutrialist or to fight the wars of the Fascist. </p>
<p>If you look to history you will find the same thing happened to the Roman Republic. Small farmers were replaced by huge plantations worked by slave labor. Sure they built an Empire but did it last? Today we are trading a Repulic for an Empire but is this a wise decision? </p>
<p>Small farmers are very important to a Republic but not at all necessary for an Empire. There are a lot of us that are of little importance when building an Empire. An Empire only needs numbers and not specific types of individuals. The sum total of the product produced is much more important for an Empire than the quality of life for those that produce it. </p>

		<p>A large part of the problem in Atlantic Canada (a.k.a. the Maritimes) was created by decades of government handouts by the federal Liberal party in Ottawa. There are all sorts of economic-distorting subsidies given out to the Maritimes to keep industries alive that should have gone out of business decades ago. A culture of welfarism and dependency has been created. There is a thing the Maritimes have they call the 10/42. They can work just ten weeks a year and collect unemployment insurance all year round. The upshot of all this welfare largess is to hinder job mobility. People don&rsquo;t leave the Maritimes in great numbers to find REAL jobs elsewhere in the country. They then faithfully vote for the party in Ottawa (traditionally meaning the Liberals) who gave them all the handouts. Atlantic Canada is vastly over-represented in Ottawa in relation to its share of the population. Prince Edward Island for example has a population of only 133,000 but has four members of parliament. There are entire ridings in British Columbia or Ontario that are almost as populous as this with only ONE M.P. The whole thing is a Canadian equivalent to the old British &#8220;rotten Boroughs&#8221;. Atlantic Canada is a saltwater Appalachia - with all the same pathologies.</p>

		<p>There is a historical reason for the long summer school break. Nothing to do with education, it gave a chance to the kids help  harvest. Like many other thing, getting those poor kids to work is now slave labour, cruel and unusal punishment ect. but the 10 weeks off in summer is a sacred right, far more sacred to the educators than to the students. Thus have the mighty fallen.</p>
