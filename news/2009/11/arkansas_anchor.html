<h1>Arkansas Anchorwoman&rsquo;s Face Shattered &#8216;Like an Egg&rsquo; During Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One blow ruined her smile and others crushed the middle of her face, but the attack on television personality Anne Pressly didn&rsquo;t end until after her jaw was forced to the back of her head and cut off blood flow to her brain, a medical examiner said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors rested their capital murder case against Curtis Lavelle Vance, 29, after testimony from the state&rsquo;s deputy medical examiner, who spoke about Pressly&rsquo;s final moments of consciousness.</p>
<p>Vance, of Marianna, has pleaded not guilty to murder, rape and burglary. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Erickson said an examination of Pressly&rsquo;s body after her death revealed that her face shattered &#8220;like an egg&#8221; during the attack. &#8220;I could feel crunchiness&#8221; while examining Pressly&rsquo;s face, he said. A photo he used showed her nose pushed to one side.</p>
<p>Erickson said some type of object likely was used during the attack  &mdash;  the butt of a pistol or perhaps some type of club.</p>
<p>Pressly, the co-host of a morning TV show who had a bit part in the President Bush biopic &#8220;W,&#8221; was hit so hard that a tooth  &mdash;  root intact  &mdash;  flew to her bedroom floor. Another blow crushed bones in the middle of her face. Another shoved her jaw backward, leaving her brain starved for blood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pressly, 26, was attacked early Oct. 20, 2008, at her home in Little Rock. Her mother, unable to reach Pressly by telephone, found her daughter shortly before she was due on KATV&rsquo;s &#8220;Daybreak&#8221; program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erickson said it was possible that Pressly felt pain even after the attack  &mdash;  even if she couldn&rsquo;t have responded to anyone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erickson said Pressly had injuries consistent with being raped. Defense lawyer Katherine Street, however, questioned whether they could have been caused by a medical examination. Erickson said it was possible, but said it appeared they were inflicted about the time of the attack.</p>
<p>On a tape played for jurors Monday, Vance told a police detective that he beat Pressly with a piece of wood that he found in her backyard  &mdash;  but never explained why. &#8220;I lose control, she lose control,&#8221; Vance said in the February interview.</p>
<p>Police witnesses said DNA evidence linked Vance to Pressly&rsquo;s death and to a Marianna rape case in which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s arguing for his own execution, or at the very least, his lifetime incarceration.  Anyone who would shatter a woman&rsquo;s face like an egg simply because he &#8220;lost control&#8221; isn&rsquo;t someone to be trusted in the free world, or even inside the general population section of an ordinary prison.</p>

		<p>Another case of &#8220;robbery gone bad&#8221;, as the media like to call it.  In reality, this was just another case of a mindless black sexual predator raping and murdering a pretty white woman.  Hopefully the jury will do their job and give it the death penalty.</p>

		<p>Interesting that this vicious attack occurred before the election - and of course, no national coverage.</p>
<p>I guess the media decided it was something that we all didn&rsquo;t need to hear about before the black hero was elected. </p>
<p>But I did happen to see it now being covered on FOX with pictures of the victim and perp.</p>
<p>Is it just me&hellip;or what is it with these africans and their dead, soul less eyes ?   </p>

		<p>His DNA evidence linked Vance to Pressly&rsquo;s death and to a Marianna rape case in which he has pleaded not guilty</p>
<p>That indicates he was likely a convicted felon since they knew who to look for.</p>
<p>Had he not had his DNA in a database they probably would have never known.  I think they should take a sample of everyone&rsquo;s DNA at birth and put it into a database.  That would solve a lot of crimes.</p>

A couple years back, a black man (neighbor) entered the home of an elderly white woman. He hit her on the head with a hammer and stabbed her in the neck with a screwdriver, killing her.</p>
<p>In his confession to the police, he said he only &#8216;tapped&rsquo; her on the head and &#8216;poked&rsquo; her with the screwdriver.</p>

		<p>2. Anonymous - &#8220;What a horrific story. It is always difficult to get the why or what from these news stories. Did he break in to steal something? Did he know her? Has this psychopath committed any other crimes? They never dig too deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that there were accounts floating around shortly after the crime that somehow there was some connection, like the black killer knew a friend of a friend or the victim was dating someone he knew. </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard many details since then and the facts during the trial indicate that there was no connection between them; it was a home invasion/robbery, complete with that African style savagery we&rsquo;re all too familiar with nowadays.</p>

<p>I disagree.  I disagree with collective punishment.  Don&rsquo;t presume my guilt of a criminal lifestyle because Blacks murder, Hispanics rape and Muslims blow themselves up.  Don&rsquo;t lump me in with them.</p>
<p>America was based upon &#8216;innocent until proven guilty.&rsquo;  But that was in a time where White was the assumed race of American citizen.  Now it&rsquo;s &#8216;guilty first because there&rsquo;s too many idiots around doing stupid stuff to figure out who is who.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The Left was all over this story when it happened saying she was probably murdered by right-wingers for her part in the movie.  Unfortunately for them it  turned out to be just another Liberal sponsored black-on-white racial rape and murder,  one of the many millions of such rapes and many tens of thousands of such murders since the 60s,  most of which would never have happened if the Left treated anti-white racist violence as seriously as anti-black violence.   Contrast the coverage of the Duke case with this case.</p>

<p>Yes, there is an element of what I will call &#8220;The Eve Carson Syndrome&#8221; in this story. Nevertheless, I felt physical sickness upon viewing the two photos side by side and imagining that this woman&rsquo;s last record of visual consciousness was of this drooling animal as he went about his &#8220;lose control&#8221; mayhem.</p>

		<p>She did not lose control! She fought for her life and dignity to not be raped and killed! You did not lose control you wanted to rape rob and hurt her as she fought back you used all the power you could muster to GAIN control. Not lose control&hellip;this is about you gaining control over another person, preferably a pretty white woman who you could never have without brute force.</p>

Little Rock is mosly black (last time I was through there) and NO BLACK jury will give a black the death penalty..So my prediction is, a looooooong trial (this facilitates the political aspirations of the prosectors) several mistrials and a ridiculously light sentence IF any!</p>

		<p>His crack-addicted prostitute mother is doing a song and dance to get the jury to spare his life. She&rsquo;s saying she abused him by throwing him against a brick wall. It&rsquo;s more likely, in my opinion, that she spoiled him and gave him everything he asked for. He probably became enraged when Pressly told him &#8220;no.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Call me &#8220;medieval&#8221; if you like, but I think that the punishment for a murderer should be that they are executed in precisely the same way they committed their crime. Publicly to boot as an example of the consequences of errant behavior(s). The easy death by lethal injection is not very effective as a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221;. We&rsquo;re missing out on a golden opportunity to instruct here. Yes, the souless have no light shining behind their eyes RJS. </p>

		<p>If Pressley had given Vance a dirty look, he&rsquo;d have screamed that she was guilty of a hate crime and had the SCLC, NAACP, and Jesse and Al on his side, protesting, etc. However, as he is a black man who killed a white woman and even admits it, the media ignore race.
