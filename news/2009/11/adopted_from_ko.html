<p>The experiences of Ms. Young are common among adopted children from Korea, according to one of the largest studies of transracial adoptions, which is to be released on Monday. The report, which focuses on the first generation of children adopted from South Korea, found that 78 percent of those who responded had considered themselves to be white or had wanted to be white when they were children. Sixty percent indicated their racial identity had become important by the time they were in middle school, and, as adults, nearly 61 percent said they had traveled to Korea both to learn more about the culture and to find their birth parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report was issued by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a nonprofit adoption research and policy group based in New York. Since 1953, parents in the United States have adopted more than a half-million children from other countries, the vast majority of them from orphanages in Asia, South America and, most recently, Africa. {snip}</p>

		<p>My family has been interested in adoption, specifically interracial adoption, for as long as I can remember. There were literally hundreds of adoption magazines in our house as I was growing up, and I even met &#8220;grandma Holt,&#8221; who with her husband, Harry, founded Holt international, an adoption agency which has helped hundreds of thousands of whites adopt children from other countries. Though I had little understanding of the race issue, some of the things I read in that magazine actually opened my eyes to racial issues. I clearly remember reading a paragraph written by a black girl who had been adopted by white woman of Swedish descent. She said that although she loved her Swedish-American mother, black children really need to be raised by a black mother. There was also an article by Bertha Holt, who was bothered by a comment that a Korean woman in some position of government made (which position, I don&rsquo;t recall). The Korean woman  remarked that it was sad that all of those Korean babies would grow up not learning Korean culture or speaking the Korean language. Grandma Holt felt the loss of Korean culture was not to be compared to the gain of two loving parents, despite the difference in race and culture. Perhaps there is some truth to that. But that someone would actually lament the loss of culture caused by transcontinental adoption made an impression on my young mind.  </p>

		<p>One of my best friends is a South Korean adoptee. He&rsquo;s as American as I am, but he is more interested in Japan than Korea, and he pulls the Asian card when he thinks it&rsquo;ll work in his favor. I&rsquo;ve shown him this site many times when a story is posted that I think he would enjoy, and he&rsquo;s never called me a racist. Probably because he knows that I would throw that charge right back at him, with an additional charge of hypocracy. Then we would probably laugh at how ridiculous it all is. </p>

		<p>How would we feel if wealthy Chinese or Africans came here specifically requesting blond blue-eyed orphans to adopt?</p>
<p>I would hope that we would have a visceral reaction, as we should feel if our children were being removed from the loving protection of our group.  As such, whites should not adopt out of race.</p>
<p>Adoptions out of race should be out-lawed as an unnatural practice.  </p>

		<p>Nature instills in every race the desire to be among one&rsquo;s own kind.</p>
<p>Everytime some fool has tried to overide natural human instincts he has failed miserably, and this experiment in multicultural/multiracial insanity will be no different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame some children have to be raised outside their own people in an alien culture in order to make some mentally ill do-gooder feel good about him/herself.</p>
<p>Since other races don&rsquo;t adopt white children, I suspect the affliction which prompts whites to adopt another race is exclusively a failing of only whites, at least for the most part.</p>
<p>Has anybody heard of a white child being adopted by a Korean family? </p>
<p>Me neither.  Or any other race for that matter.</p>

		<p>When will Whites ever learn? Quit adopting nonwhite children! I have noticed a trend in White couples who even have their own biological children adopting nonwhite kids. What is up with that? Do they get brownie points or something? I think they believe they are &#8220;superior&#8221; to the rest of us who should know better and love to pat themselves on the back and receive accolades from the rest of the dummies out there.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a real difference between Western culture and Eastern.  Are White American babies available for overseas adoption?  No, because Whites, to put it plainly, have bigger hearts than other races.  We take in White kids unrelated to us, and some of us even welcome Oriental children, and treat them as if they were our own.  Koreans won&rsquo;t even adopt the babies of their own nation.  Those people threw them out when they were helpless infants and Whites took them in and loved them.  If they want an Asian identity after that, let them stay there.  </p>

<p>I never ever call anyone around me a racist.  On the other hand, I occasionally hear I am a racist.  When Obama won the Nobel prize, I never hesitated to say &#8220;at least give it to someone who has done something&hellip;.&#8221; and I did not even say a thing about Obama&rsquo;s race and I heard I am a racist.  I asked, &#8220;then what has he done to deserve the Nobel prize?&#8221; and all I witnessed was a deafening silence.  I definitely heard a few people calling me racists, but there were also quite a few white folks who strongly agreed with me that the Nobel prize committee made a wrong decision in giving it to him.</p>
<p>No I never use an &#8220;Asian race card&#8221;, but I used &#8220;I-saw-<i>others</i>-doing-the-same-thing-or-much-worse-and-they-got-away&#8221; card a few times.  Worked like a charm.  You know why I italicized &#8220;others&#8221;  </p>

		<p>In some - not all - instances Korean adoptees were rescued from circumstances of the most abject misery by North American / Antipodean / European adoptive parents.</p>
<p>Most do well - some do VERY well like ythe shrewd cookie married to Woody Allen and hundreds of others - and a few turn out bad - like the &#8216;hipster grifter&rsquo; and a tiny handful fuel a grievance industry making a fuss about how wicked it was for Swedish - and other - adoptive parents to rescue and love a tiny and abandoned Korean child:</p>

		<p>I think racial identity is only a big issue for adopted kids when it is a black child. The Asian and Hispanic kids adopted by these nice white suburban couples tend to act, think and speak white. </p>
<p>Growing up it is fine but once the adopted blacks hit college they search for a black identity and start reading Malcolm X (while thier silly white adopted parents pay thier tuition, room and board).</p>

		<p>A decade ago, I worked in a think tank that received numerous review copies of books. One that stood out was a book on Korean females adopted by white parents. It was fascinating as there was almost no anti-white animus or hatred like I have seen in most black kids adopted by whites.</p>
<p>Sexual issues were a big theme and the only vaguely anti-white comment was by one Asian woman who believed that only dorky white guys are attracted to Asian girls. A lesbian talked of growing up and only being attracted to tall, thin white women with blond hair.</p>
<p>For the most part, I think Asians are not a big threat to us. Most will (or at least can) assimilate. A lot of half Asian people (Keanu Reeves, Meg Tilly, Phoebe Cates, Dean Cain ..etc) look and act white.</p>

A majority of the kids who end up in the foster care system and who are available for adoption in the U.S. are non-Caucasian.  Since most of the people who adopt children are Caucasian couples, it may not always be possible to match the child&rsquo;s race with the adoptive family&rsquo;s face.  If there aren&rsquo;t any Caucasian children available, the couple may end up adopting a Black child or a Latino child instead or they may end up adopting a child from another country like Romania.

Where are all the unadopted white children? There are next to none. That&rsquo;s why the emotionally starved white women adopt outside of their race.<br>
Girl babies aren&rsquo;t highly valued in asia and it&rsquo;s rare for a korean to care about someone who&rsquo;s not a blood relation.<br>
 I&rsquo;m sure theres an interesting reason as to why so many american black babies go unadopted.<br>

		<p>This is a common pattern in America with Asians, adopted or otherwise. They want desperately to fit in and be accepted into the mainstream, but sooner or later they realize that they&rsquo;ll never be White and end up looking back to their culture of origin for their identity. The problem then becomes the realization that they have little in common with their long lost countries and are stuck in a limbo of racial ambiguity. The happiest Asians that I know are the Asians that hang with other Asians. Asians that are the token colored friend of Whites always seem to try too hard or act awkwardly sheepish. I like Asian people and have Asian friends but when it is just me with a group of them, I realize how it must feel for them most of the time.</p>

		<p>Some twelve yrs ago I remember meeting in a youth hostel in Canada two korean guys traveling independent of eachother but both assigned to the room I was in. I had conversations of substance with both and they struck me as intelligent and honorable,&hellip; less giddy than most Americans I would meet. Also interesting was that all of us were concerned with the idea of (Identity) in this fast changing world, one of these guys was even reading a book on the subject at the time. The older of the two I also engaged in the idea of race mixing and while he believed it possible but unlikely he would consider a white women &hellip; the idea of black was incompatible with his taste he let me know in a tasteful way. When I left that hostile the memory of these fellows struck me as the more honorable ones I met there.</p>

Perhaps he would discover all is not as it seems in his limited scope of the world.  Many, many asians that were adopted have proven to be an asset to the United States.  Narrow minded views will get you nowhere and please don&rsquo;t bother to respond with your feeble bleatings.

<p>I was talking about the Whites that already have their own biological children adopting one that is not of their race or their children&rsquo;s race. Why? They don&rsquo;t need more children and if they did why not have some more of their own? </p>
<p>To those who love to call one narrow minded or somehow &#8220;weird&#8221; or selfish if they do not agree with interracial adoptions, I have to ask what is YOUR problem? I, for one, do not condone inter-racial adoptions anymore than I condone inter-racial marriages and bi-racial children from those marriages. Kind begets kind and that is the natural order. One only has to have eyes to see to know that.</p>

Reconsider your thought process, but alas it is probably to late to do so, and look around you, the world was not constructed nor built by only whites.  Asians have probably contributed more to the advancement of mankind than you would ever think.  Don&rsquo;t be so narrow minded.  The world is much bigger than your mind.  Look, learn, and then advance.  So much sorrow in your thought process. Most Korean&rsquo;s that were adopted have become sterling citizens not bleating their woes against others. </p>

<p>    I doubt that day will ever come. There are not that many blond blue-eyed orphans up for adoption. Many Korean orphans were adopted before Korea&rsquo;s present day prosperity. Girls seemed to be adopted more than boys, perhaps, indicating a Korean preference for male child adoption. There were cultural and economic pressures against adoption in Korea in the past, but these seem to be abating today. I&rsquo;ve known some Korean adoptees and they act more American (does that mean white?) than Asian. Most are successful.  I believe many would have trouble fitting back into Korean culture.  </p>
