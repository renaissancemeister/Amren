			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel de Vise, Washington Post, November 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leaders of the U.S. Naval Academy tinkered with the composition of the color guard that appeared at a World Series game last month so the group would not be exclusively white and male.</p>
<p>Accounts differ as to who was added to or removed from the Oct. 29 color guard. But the net result was that one of the six who marched on Yankee Stadium&rsquo;s field, Midshipman 2nd Class Hannah Allaire, was selected because her presence would make the service academy look more diverse before a national audience.</p>
<p>The incident has captured the attention of the Annapolis campus and stirred up the broader community of alumni and military observers, who see it as part of a campaign to bring more racial and sexual diversity to the academy. Diversity is a sensitive point at the Naval Academy, an institution that has been accused by some faculty members and alumni of forsaking fairness in its quest to build a brigade that mirrors the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, elevated diversity to a &#8220;strategic imperative&#8221; during his tenure as chief of naval operations. Academy leaders, on their official Web site, call diversity &#8220;our highest personnel priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>That thinking reflects &#8220;a sea change, in that this initiative was generated from within the military, rather than imposed from without by civilian overseers,&#8221; said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Thomas Wilkerson, an academy alumnus and chief executive of the U.S. Naval Institute, an independent think tank. Some alumni, he said, &#8220;have voiced concerns that it will happen at the expense of quality and combat readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>A military-oriented blog, CDR Salamander, reported last week that two white men had been pulled from the color guard that went to Yankee Stadium and replaced with an Asian American man and a white woman to make the group more diverse.</p>
<p>Academy leadership disputed that account.</p>
<p>&#8220;No midshipman was ever given approval to attend this event and then later told they could not,&#8221; said Capt. Matthew Klunder, commandant of midshipmen, in a statement Monday. He said he considered replacing two white men but chose to expand the color guard from six to eight to make it more representative of the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A report in the Navy Times, citing unnamed sources, stated that two white men were replaced by Allaire and Hameed. The report noted that a pregame news release named a six-person color guard, including Allaire and Hameed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to an academy spokesman, Cmdr. Joe Carpenter, the color guard was invited to present the flag during the national anthem at the World Series game. Senior staff members reviewed the names of those who wanted to go, all white males, and decided that the group should better reflect the academy&rsquo;s diversity. Of the 4,400 midshipmen, 20 percent are female, and about one-quarter are members of minority groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About the ensuing controversy, Klunder said: &#8220;It is regretful that assumptions were made&#8221; by the six midshipmen who asked to march at Yankee Stadium, &#8220;but it has been and will remain the Naval Academy leadership&rsquo;s prerogative&#8221; to decide who carries the flag.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about that myself.  I think it&rsquo;s not that integration caused the military to be weaker (overall, but there are exceptions), but it&rsquo;s that the &#8220;progressive&#8221; mentality that wanted the military integrated also wants the military handcuffed when it fights wars in Korea, Nam, Iraq and Afghanistan, even if said military was entirely white.</p>

		<p>Firstly, let me take on Capt. Matthew Klunder, Commandant of Midshipmen, USNA.</p>
<p>He is quoted as saying &#8220;It is regretful that assumptions were made&#8221; by the six midshipmen etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>The midshipmen did not make assumptions, they made presumptions based on the fact situation as they knew it.</p>
<p>Klunder&rsquo;s statement should have been &#8220;It is regretful that presumptions were made&#8221; by the six midshipmen etc. etc. etc.  His statement is grammatically incorrect.  How can we explain how someone who can&rsquo;t control the King&rsquo;s English is allowed to control the USNA?  Is Klunder a product of the USNA?  Young men, you can consider the USNA as an undergraduate school, but I think you would really be better off at Exeter University, Devon. </p>
<p>Secondly, given Adm. Mike Mullen&rsquo;s &#8220;strategic imperative&#8221; to impose diversity in/on the USN, the policy bodes ill for a young white man&rsquo;s naval career.  Such that ones chances and opportunity for advancement in ones chosen naval career should be far greater in the Swiss Navy than in the United States Navy.  Choose accordingly.</p>

		<p>Whenever there is ANY priority other than quality, then quality will suffer.  Since Mike Mullen has admitted that quality is not his highest priority, then it is a certainty that quality and combat readiness will suffer.  If I jumped off a 20 story building, would it be a &#8220;concern&#8221; that I might get hurt?  Similarly, it is not a &#8220;concern&#8221; that quality will suffer when it is replaced by &#8220;diversity&#8221; as the main priority.  It is a fact.</p>

<p>I think I have an answer for you:</p>
<p>SCOTUS&rsquo; decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS. After that, the armed forces officially ended segregation.</p>
<p>There are other factors as well, like hare-brained military strategies, quality of troops and political correctness run amok, but it all began with Brown.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you call sleeping on your laurels. Meanwhile, the enemy is sneaking in through the wide-open gates, while our leaders dream about diversity.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;It is regretful that assumptions were made&rdquo;, said  Capt. Matthew Klunder, Commandant of Midshipmen, USNA.</b></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to say it&rsquo;s  &#8220;regrettable&#8221;  that assumptions were made.  (Isn&rsquo;t the USNA supposed to be an educational institution?)   <br>

<p>Segregated black units were extremely ill-disciplined and ineffective. Just did not perform tasks well and had to be coerced in many instances. Ill-disciplined to the point of near anarchy in some circumstances. Truman said he wanted to present a good image to the world but it was much more than that.</p>

		<p>One of the greatest scandals in store for us in the near future is a calamity involving the military  &mdash;    &mdash;  and it just might entail more than one incident before the scadalous information about the military will be revealed to the public, unless it amounts to something high profile that can&rsquo;t be hidden, like a battle loss involving an inferior enemy.</p>
<p>Being the only 800 pound military gorilla of the world allows for the cover up of many social engineering policies that are in play right now.</p>
<p>But the world is fast catching up, and a cunning enemy with only half the firepower could very likely humilitate this politically correct military apparatus that we are burdened with, which continues to degenerate on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>Whether two mids were replaced or two others added, the point is the USNA has become obessed with diversity.  Another article I read stated that 35% of new mids were minorities.  Maybe we can talk future enemies into surrendering.</p>
