<h1>Sources: USNA Subbed Mids to Look More Diverse</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Ewing, Navy Times, November 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Naval Academy leaders removed two midshipmen from a color guard that performed at the World Series last week because they were white men, and replaced them with a non-white man and a white woman so the academy could present a more &#8220;diverse&#8221; profile, according to several sources, a move that has reportedly angered mids and alumni.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the color guard still ended up all white because the male replacement forgot parts of his uniform.</p>
<p>Two white, male members of the color guard learned Oct. 28 they were being replaced with a white woman, Midshipman 2nd Class Hannah Allaire, and a non-white man, Midshipman 2nd Class Zishan Hameed, on orders of the school&rsquo;s administration, according to an internal e-mail message provided to Navy Times by an academy professor. With a national television audience, Naval Academy leadership worried the color guard it planned to send wasn&rsquo;t diverse enough, the e-mail said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s decision upset many of the mids, according to the e-mail. But after Klunder [Naval Academy Commandant Capt. Matt Klunder] heard complaints about the situation from alumni and family members, the brigade&rsquo;s company commanders were ordered to tell their midshipmen they were forbidden from discussing the color guard story with people outside the Yard, according to a source familiar with the situation who was not authorized to discuss it.</p>

		<p>After listening to the rantings of General Casey and his concerns FOR muslim soldiers and now this, why oh why do white guys insist on joining the armed forces for this country? A country that is bound and determined to marginalize them at every turn. This country takes for granted white guys will just suck it up and go along and still do most of the heavy lifting even as they enter second class citizenship.</p>

<p>Yes, and race isn&rsquo;t supposed to mean anything in the multicult&rsquo;s utopia, eh?</p>

		<p>Consider how surprising this is. Achieving diversity, especially ethnic diversity, is an explicit goal of virtually all major corporations, universities, and government agencies. The U.S. Supreme Court has declared that diversity is a &ldquo;compelling state interest&rdquo; that overrides legal prohibitions on race-based school admissions. Top politicians routinely utter some version of the phrase &ldquo;diversity is our strength&rdquo; in speeches. Our immigration policy even features a &ldquo;diversity lottery&rdquo; that randomly offers green cards to foreign nationals whose primary qualification is that they come from exotic countries.<br/>
Maybe, just maybe, America is overdoing the diversity thang.  How about individual qualifications instead of quotas? PC and diversity seems to rule everything in this country. The shooter at Fort Hood was not challenged before his shooting spree because of PC.  Lets go with the best American at all levels and do away with quotas and diversity.</p>

		<p>Well &#8220;Captain Matt&#8221; why don&rsquo;t we start with your job, you step down and let a black man take your job!I mean, you thought nothing of throwing two White Midshipman under the bus to make your self look good. If &#8220;diversity&#8221; is SOOOO important, them you, yourself need to set an example. And am I the only one that thought he&rsquo;d never live to see the day when a Midshipman 2nd class would have a name like &#8220;Zishan Hameed&#8221;!! </p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s hard to remain hopeful for our nation . We are even divided here on Amren . I thought the sixties were bad . I predict a cataclysmic event for us in the not too distant future, I hope I am wrong . I am glad I grew up in a very different America, at least I have those memories . Of course even then things were beginning to unravel.I live in south Georgia and I am sometimes amazed at my liberal friends who support the very changes that have destroyed southern white culture and now ominously threaten Euro-American culture .</p>

		<p>We lost in Viet Nam and are losing in Afghanland because our enemies had and have fewer ring knocking academy graduates in their ranks than we do or did. Casey tells us that these killings were unfortunate but if we have a back lash towards Muslims that would be worse. He didn`t say why the hell wasn`t he told that Major Ali Baba was contacting terrorists two years ago. We need a draft and get all our officers from OCS. The academies turn out suck up career protectors not warriors with common sense as well as brains. I didn`t know a single active duty reserve naval officer who hadn`t been shafted at least once by a ring knocker.<br/>

		<p>I served in the Navy and the Marine Corps.  What I saw of the United States Navy to put it politely, did not impress me at all.  There were no standards, nor pride in service.  Incidentally, the Navy is lowering its admission standards to the U.S. Naval Academy-for the sake of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  How much longer do all of us have to suffer the overall lowering of standards, plus disasters like what happened at Fort Hood, until common sense makes a comeback?  Personally, I&rsquo;m not optimistic.</p>

		<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t worry about things like this. It&rsquo;s all just a prelude to what&rsquo;s coming. </p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t get caught flatfooted when the real fighting starts in this country. Be alert and be ready at all times. Your families are counting on you.</p>

		<p>It sounds as though the color guard wasn&rsquo;t <em>colored</em> enough.</p>

		<p>They were worried that the Color Guard that performed at the World Series wasn&rsquo;t colored enough.  But they aren&rsquo;t bothered that the baseball teams playing in the WS are full of Afro- and mulatto-Caribbean Hispanics, so MLB isn&rsquo;t white enough.</p>
