			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Miss England Rachel Christie has given up her crown after being arrested on suspicion of a nightclub assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She allegedly punched Miss Manchester, Sara Beverley Jones, 24, in the face in a dispute at a Manchester nightclub.</p>
<p>Ms Christie, the first black woman to be crowned Miss England, was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been bailed until January 2010.</p>
<p>The beauty queen, niece of former sprinter Linford Christie, is also a heptathlete hoping to compete in the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>Miss Manchester was allegedly punched in the face after an argument said to be about a TV personality from Sky1&rsquo;s Gladiators programme.</p>
<p>It is thought that Miss Jones is an ex-girlfriend of TV gladiator Tornado, whose real name is David McIntosh, and Miss Christie is his current partner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>First of all, she&rsquo;s not black, she&rsquo;s partially black.  And, secondly, the other two runners up are prettier than she is.</p>
<p>I wonder how the politically correct judges feel about their selection now?</p>
<p>These events worlwide are getting more and more political.  Behind it all, are the cowardly whites who think selecting a non-white will give them more security somehow.  They&rsquo;re too dimwitted to understand that whitey will always be a target for non-whites, especially blacks, no matter what he does, short of fighting back.</p>
<p>Whites were regarded with the highest respect ever when they refused to take any guff of any kind from the non-white malcontents years ago.  Force and the threat of force are the only thing non-whites respect.</p>

		<p>She probably punched &#8220;Miss Manchester&#8221; because she&rsquo;s a petite blonde. A very pretty blonde in my opinion. Most non-white women, especially blacks, hate white women, in particular blonde white women. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the same beauty who was crowned after receiving only 9 public votes. Apparently she was awarded first place by four of the six judges.<br>

		<p>Do they have affirmative action for beauty contests participants, now, in England?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that she&rsquo;s bad looking, of course&hellip; But does she measure up to the kinds of standards that are those of such contests?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be awful&hellip;well, not really, OK, I do. <br>
But things are pretty bad in Merry Ol&rsquo; England when  a 6 year old girl is branded a &#8216;racist&rsquo; (dissedent, if you will) and Miss England looks like a bloke - and not an English bloke!</p>
<p>The woman on the right is infinitly better looking than the one in the centre - she actually looks like a woman!</p>

		<p>From the original article:-</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.. her win was under something of a cloud after the contest&rsquo;s website showed that she had gained only nine votes in the public voting part of the competition, compared with fellow finalist Zoiey Smale, who got 2,013.&#8221;</p>
<p>The British didnt vote for her but a panel of multiculturalist judges deemed that the English should be represented by a black woman and overuled them.</p>
<p>Upon &#8220;winning&#8221; she said &#8220;She said at the time: &#8220;My main focus in winning Miss England is to show black kids that they can be whatever they want to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Including altering their genetics to become English it seems. Magic.</p>
<p>What sweet justice to find how she has reverted to type and disgraced herself.</p>
<p>She is now replaced by a real English woman = Lance Corporal Katrina Hodge.</p>

		<p>Growing up on military bases around the world, I was always embarrassed about how blacks represented the United States in front of the citizens of the host nations we lived in. They always misbehaved and acted obnoxious, and I am hoping to this day that the citizens of the host nations we were stationed at knew these people didn&rsquo;t really represent America. I am so disgusted with how both America and Europe use these people to represent our respective civilizations on so many levels, and using them in beauty pageants is really pushing the envelope.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that every now and then there is a black who is qualified to represent us in a particular position.  But I am only tolerant of this here in America where blacks have long been a small part of our nation&rsquo;s history.  However, blacks have no place whatsoever in England, as they have had nothing to do with that nation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>As I said, here in America I can tolerate it to a degree if the black is qualified.  But we have over represented blacks within so many prominent positions (most of the time undeserved) to the point where I am sick and tired of seeing them even if they are qualified.  I have had enough.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even listen to Talk Radio anymore.  Sean Hannity screens the people who call into his show to make it seem as if 50% of his callers are black.  Rush Limbaugh, after getting in trouble with the NFL, has been bending over backwards to put prominent blacks on his show who are on his side.  Neal Boortz has a black in his studio crew and he also has a black sit in for him when he isn&rsquo;t on the show. </p>
<p> I think, without realiziing it, they are hurting their shows more than helping them. One of these days they will realize that the overwhelming majority of blacks don&rsquo;t agree with what they talk about most of the time on their shows. And do they seriously think that conservative white Americans want to sit and listen to a &#8220;conservative&#8221; &#8220;educated&#8221; black man as a guest on a conservative talk radio show, go on and on while pronouncing &#8220;this and that&#8221; as &#8220;dis and dat&#8221;?  Yes, that sounds real &#8220;educated&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>For the longest time I viewed Micheal S. (can&rsquo;t say his last name on here because it won&rsquo;t go through the filter) as the last bastion of hope for us on Talk Radio.  Well, last night he kept questioning some prominent Major in the military on the shooting in Texas.  Apparantely this guy wants to run for office; he is real conservative, and MS kept telling him he would support him.  I find out later he is African American.</p>
<p>As I said, I would respect stuff like this every now and then, acknowledging that the black is really the most qualified.  But we have over abused and exhausted this generosity way too much in our nation over the past 40 years.  It gets to the point where not only do I question a prominent black&rsquo;s credibility, but I am just sick of seeing them represent us in any position all together.</p>
<p>All of this aside, blacks should NEVER be representing England of all places in beauty pageants.  When did we become so dumb?</p>

		<p>I hate to point out the truth, but she is no more English than a Chinese woman, or a Martian. She is an African woman living in England with British (or Euro) citizenship. The one thing she will never be is English. Remember that living in Africa didn&rsquo;t make Africans out of English and Dutchmen? This woman was never &#8220;Miss England&#8221;, and could never be. </p>

		<p>I hate to burst your bubble John, but here in America, Asian women don&rsquo;t hold a candle to white women.  Obviously, here in America, white women aren&rsquo;t in danger of losing their men.  The last time I checked, 90% of whites marry other whites.</p>

<p>Where did you get that idea? Certainly not from the 1,000,000 people who voted for the BNP, from the white flighters or from the large number of people who will express support for BNP policies in &#8216;safe&rsquo; company and, hopefully, at the ballot box.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t listen any longer to talk shows. They ALL pander to the blacks and assorted nonwhites. They are sooo terrified of that word &#8220;racist&#8221; that it makes me ill. They are of no help to our race or our nation, in fact they are helping to disarm the White population even more by their dishonesty and foolery and trying to prove that there are &#8220;good&#8221; blacks and that we should support them. I will never support a black &#8220;conservative&#8221;!!! Just look at JC Watts and Powell among others, that showed their true &#8220;colors&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Hello, everybody.<br>
I&rsquo;m an engineer trying to make a profit in the economic moonscape called Nigeria. The place is hopeless. I find Africans impossible to understand but I feel I must correct some of the mistakes you guys publish. Anybody who knows how evolution works would quickly be able to work out that racial differences in intelligence could never have evolved GIVEN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH HUMANS LIVED IN THE LATE STONE AGE. Believe it or not, the problems of Africans are completely cultural. They&rsquo;re hopeless because Sub-Saharan Africa is the only large continental landmass on Earth outside Eurasia that Europeans did not overrun. Yeah, I know, it&rsquo;s doomed to. It&rsquo;s returning to the stone age. I always wonder what Nigeria would look like if 150 million white people lived in it. LOL.</p>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t care much for the Chinaman, I will admit that he has a point about white male/oriental female interbreeding being a problem. I would also disagree that white women are not in danger. Look out in the street sometime and you&rsquo;ll see that the mulatto child is not only becoming more prevalent and acceptable, but since Obama hijacked his way to Washington, encouraged.</p>
<p>With that said if other non-whites (read Asian) were to mix with more blacks, that is fine by me. I actively encourage non-whites to mix with other non-whites.  </p>

Jones twittered Monday: &#8216;Bad time last night. Assaulted in a nightclub.&rsquo;  Without identifying Jones by names, cops say the victim suffered &#8216;superficial facial injuries.&rsquo;&#8221;  Blacks are so jealous it&rsquo;s incredible.  </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right; many whites are not realizing how pathetic the upcoming generation of white female urbanites actually are&hellip;.<br>

		<p>How could anyone with a brain vote for her?</p>
<p>She has the classic signs of extreme ugly:</p>
<p>Eyes too far apart<br>
Huge lips and nose<br>
Horse face<br>
Disproportionately huge mouth full of huge teeth</p>
<p>If the prize was &#8220;Looks most like a farm animal&#8221; they would be dead on.</p>

		<p>If the English will not support BNP, UK will be a mulatto land with a few islands of white people for a while and then just a third world illiterate waste land of mulattoes fighting for food.</p>
<p>After one hundred years the patient and well disciplined Chinese will wipe out all these abominations and claim the land of former UK to their large empire.</p>
<p>I am sure that the Chinese will value the history of the now extinct Brits.<br>

		<p>Can we stop pretending to celebrate the &#8220;beauty&#8221; of women who just don&rsquo;t turn us on, just because they are non-white? There is no such thing as a pity erection.</p>
<p>If you shaved off Miss England&rsquo;s hair she would look like Charles Barkley.<br>

		<p>England and the rest of Great Britain seem to have changed so much, because of multiculturalism, in recent years.</p>
<p>An uncle of mine lived and worked in London in the 1980&rsquo;s. I guess if he went back say, tomorrow, he wouldn&rsquo;t recognize the place!</p>
<p>Now, I know that Tony Blair&rsquo;s government let great numbers of people from India and Pakistan immigrate to England. But why does Britain give in to all demands from those immigrants? Whose country is it, anyway?</p>

<p>It only claims mulatto boyfriend was sending suggestive messages to the victim. This is typical black male behavior. They hit on as many woman as possible till one &#8216;bites&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s normally the heavy girl or the psycho with something to prove (Obamas mom).</p>

		<p>England has become quite a joke. I don&rsquo;t know what they are trying to prove. That the two women flanking Miss England are hands down more beautiful than she is,only a blind man could disagree with. I really am not giving the usual cop-out disclaimer when I say, that I&rsquo;m NOT saying this because she&rsquo;s black, I&rsquo;m saying it because it&rsquo;s true.(at least to my eyes)</p>
