<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/17/nubian-fury-haifa-wehbe">Nubian Fury at &#8216;Monkey&rsquo; Lyric of Arab Pop Star Haifa Wehbe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), November 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the Arab world&rsquo;s biggest pop stars has provoked a torrent of outrage after releasing a song which refers to black Egyptians as monkeys.</p>
<p>Haifa Wehbe, an award-winning Lebanese diva who has been voted one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful people, is now facing a lawsuit from Egyptian Nubians claiming the song has fuelled discrimination against them and made some Nubian children too afraid to attend school.</p>
<p>The row has cast fresh light on the position within Egyptian society of Nubians, who are descended from one of Africa&rsquo;s most ancient black civilisations and yet often face marginalisation in modern Egypt.</p>
<p>Wehbe, a 35-year-old model turned actress and singer, is widely regarded as the Middle East&rsquo;s most prominent sex symbol and has been no stranger to controversy in the past. Her skimpy outfits and provocative lyrics (one previous hit was entitled Ya Ibn El Halal, roughly translated as Hey, Good Little Muslim Boy) have earned her the wrath of religious conservatives and forays into the political arena have also sparked debate, including her very public praise for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p>The latest accusations of racism came after the release of her new song, Where is Daddy?, in which a child sings to Wehbe, &#8220;Where is my teddy bear and the Nubian monkey?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wehbe has since apologised profusely for the offending lyrics, insisting they were penned by an Egyptian songwriter who told her that &#8220;Nubian monkey&#8221; was an innocent term for a popular children&rsquo;s game. That hasn&rsquo;t stopped a group of Nubian lawyers submitting an official complaint to Egypt&rsquo;s public prosecutor and calling for the song to be banned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is upset,&#8221; said Sayed Maharous, 49, the Nubian owner of a coffee shop in Cairo. Adul Raouf Mohammed, who runs a nearby store, agreed. &#8220;To compare a human being to an animal is insulting in any culture. She has denigrated an entire community of people, and now some of our children are afraid to go into school because they know they will be called monkeys in the playground.&#8221;</p>
<p>The row over Wehbe&rsquo;s song has highlighted a growing sense of communal identity among Nubians in Egypt, a country where the government has traditionally promoted a very monolithic brand of nationalism, sometimes to the exclusion of religious or ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Despite breaking through into the cultural mainstream  &mdash;  several Nubian novelists are well-regarded within Egyptian intellectual circles and Nubian singers such as Mohammed Mounir are among the most popular in the country  &mdash;  Egypt&rsquo;s estimated two million Nubians remain largely invisible on television and film, except as lampooned stereotypes.<br/>

		<p>Caucasians the world over have always shunned co-habiting and or mixing with blacks,&hellip;its simply a fact. Yet blacks seem ever to gravitate to whites inspite of this. Blacks don&rsquo;t like insults leveled at them by whites but seem to prefer company of whites with insults than no company of whites at all. Maybe in their subconsious the hope to mingle their seed with white blood is what maintains this clinging to whites by blacks.</p>

		<p>Wonder what the Afrocentrists will have to say about all this, given that Nubians are still largely &#8220;lampooned stereotypes&#8221; among the dark-skinned Arab brethren in the country that the former once ruled by magically flying around?  </p>

		<p>The whole world has a low opinion of blacks and regards them as inferior.  But, of course, there&rsquo;s so much evidence to support their views, we will never EVER see an article offering substantive rebuttal that the premise is untrue.</p>

		<p>Arabs from the Levant are lighter skinned and think that they are better than the darker Arabs from the Gulf, and both groups think they are better than the Arabs from North Africa. It is little surprise Pan-Arabism was such a spectacular failure.<br/>
To be fair, Lebanese Christians are generally more successful than than their Muslim counterparts, and connect more with the Mediterranean than with Mecca. Of course they don&rsquo;t have nearly as many kids as their Muslim counterparts. Same story different setting.</p>

		<p>I was at my hotel in Cairo one night and wondering out loud where I could go to socialize with some Egyptians. The Egyptian hotel owner told me &#8220;there are some decent clubs around here, but stay away from club such and such; there are too many blacks there and it&rsquo;s very dangerous&#8221;.  He went on to explain that he was referring to Egyptian blacks and he was under the impression that American blacks are not dangerous like Egyptian blacks are.  Up to that point, we hadn&rsquo;t spoken a word about race realism.</p>

		<p>To olewhitelady:</p>
<p>You raise an excellent point. Since the nubians ruled ancient Egypt 2000 years ago while flying around in airplanes (until their idea was stolen by the racist Wright brothers), why didn&rsquo;t they just use one of the time machines they had lying around to travel to the future and stop this song from being recorded?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The latest accusations of racism came after the release of her new song, Where is Daddy?, in which a child sings to Wehbe, &lsquo;Where is my teddy bear and the Nubian monkey?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ugh, where to begin with this article; it just works on so many levels!</p>
<p>To begin with, I can see why this Haifa Wehbe is seen as figure of controversy in the Arab world. She is quite attractive for an Arab woman and seems to enjoy dressing in outfits that moderately highlight her sex appeal, and not as an escapee from some costume shop that recycles potato sacks and tarps. A mortal sin by Islam&rsquo;s demented standards of female propriety, that likely consigns her to harlotry and hell in the minds of the more fanatical followers of &ldquo;the religion of peace,&rdquo; (i.e., something around 80% to 90% of them.) These two videos should demonstrate this point clearly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UjRoWpHAE8&amp;feature=fvw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UjRoWpHAE8&feature;=fvw</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGxm_xANs6M&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGxm_xANs6M&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>They should also demonstrate the abject hypocrisy of the Islamic rabble over there, since it would appear that her fame and fortune are mostly based on her looks and style, and not her talent as a singer. The first song, &ldquo;Wa Wa,&rdquo; comes across as particularly inane, even for Arab pop. Moreover, they demonstrate her own hypocrisy in political matters, since she supports terrorists like this Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah; I am sure, that he just loves some of the implications of that &ldquo;Wa Wa&rdquo; video. It is mildly comforting to know that self-destructive stupidity in politics by &ldquo;celebrities,&rdquo; is not limited to: London, New York, Paris, and Hollywood. </p>
<p>Next, we get the uniquely black hysterics of these Nubians in the face of her &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; Indeed, as this article notes above, she: &ldquo;…is now facing a lawsuit from Egyptian Nubians claiming the song has fuelled discrimination against them and made some Nubian children too afraid to attend school.&rdquo; It seems that aside from colonizing the Moon and Mars with their ancient space technology that whitey somehow robbed them of, they also created the maudlin greed techniques that are so typical of  &ldquo;modern&rdquo; offended-opportunity Africans the whole world over. How odd that they let us grab the space faring stuff, but managed to keep the &ldquo;racism&rdquo; jackpot science all to themselves. </p>
<p>Finally, it all comes together in an expected freak show, with her groveling and the gentle and wise founders of civilization telling her that it isn&rsquo;t good enough, not even by a long shot. These Nubians just won&rsquo;t be sated Miss Wehbe, until they have a pound of your flesh and a chunk of your change too. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Actually, Taurus the correct analogy from the Holy Koran is &#8220;pigs and monkeys&rdquo; Although some Koranic scholars claim the appellation is not anti-Jewish, as it only applies to Jews from Arabia during the time of Mohammad. Still, Jews, Christians and unbelievers come in for some rough treatment in the Koran. Burning in darkness and drinking copious amounts of boiling water are threatened for &#8220;unbelievers&#8221; throughout the Holy Koran. </p>

<p>Interesting and refreshing that the little Nubians are afraid to go to school given that their cousins over here have made everyone else afraid to go to schools where they are.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason for this.  As the article indicates, she&rsquo;s Lebanese.  In ancient times Lebanon was the home to a mysterious people called &#8220;Philistines&#8221; who many today believe were linked to the Myceneans, an Indo-European-speaking people from Greece.</p>
<p>In subsequent centuries the area was conquered and heavily colonized by Persians, Greco-Macedonians, Romans and Byzantines (Greeks).  The area became Christianized.</p>
<p>When the Muslim hordes swept into the area, the ancestors of today&rsquo;s Lebanese Christians in many cases fled to mountainous areas to avoid being Islamized.  When European Crusaders arrived centuries later, it is documented these &#8220;Maronites&#8221; welcomed their Christian &#8220;brothers&#8221; with open arms&hellip;and in many cases with their daughters&rsquo; hand in marriage!</p>
<p>There is a small community of Lebanese Christians in my area of New York City.  I have seen pretty women like Haifa Wehbe (whose mother, by the way, is a Lebanese Christian).  DNA tests confirm the presence of Western European haplogroups in the gene pool of Lebanese Christians.  </p>
<p>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080328-crusaders-dna.html</p>
<p>This would no doubt explain why so many Lebanese Christians are better looking (by Western standards of beauty) than their Muslim counterparts.</p>

		<p>LouLou:</p>
<p>You are right about that.  Hollywood made a movie in the late 70s or early 80s that involved Anwar Sadat, I can&rsquo;t remember the plot.  But the character that played Sadat was either black or much more black than Sadat was in real life.  This created a diplomatic row between Egypt and the United States, because the Egyptian government (I think by this time Sadat passed away) didn&rsquo;t like their head of state being portrayed as black.</p>

<p>Egyptians are just like Dominicans and Hindus in this matter: a little touch of &#8220;black&#8221; might be OK, but not too much! <br/>
However, they don&rsquo;t like anyone who is darker than they are.</p>

<p>John, I visited the web sites you posted on this Wehbe singer. If you were to send these videos to the Iranian mullahs and Saudi &#8220;religious police&#8221;, their heads would explode - especially seeing her in that pink feather costume in the second video!</p>
<p>Question Diversity (post # 15):</p>
<p>In the movie you refer to, Sadat was played by Roscoe Lee Browne. His wife was played by Madolyn Smith.</p>
<p>To other posters, the Koran also refers to blacks as &#8220;stinking monkeys&#8221;, and sanctions slavery (&#8216;possessing their necks&#8221;). </p>
