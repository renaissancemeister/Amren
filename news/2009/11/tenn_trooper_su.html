<h1>Tenn. Trooper Suspended Over White Pride E-Mail</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, November 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tennessee state trooper who accidentally sent an e-mail proclaiming white pride to 787 state employees has been suspended for 15 days without pay and will have to attend diversity training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state Department of Safety says Gobbell sent the e-mail to himself so he could print a copy. He did not realize he had also sent it to hundreds of state employees.</p>
<p>An investigation revealed that Gobbell later deleted his responses to the original e-mail and attempted to delete the original too. Gobbell has apologized.<br>

		<p>He has &#8220;pride&#8221; in being White and he has to go to diversity training. I could see the diversity training if he used the &#8220;n&#8221; word but he just proclaimed pride in his race. Pride is not a crime for any race.</p>

<p>Keep saying this over and over again - the blatant unfairness of it is there for everybody to see, especially the invaders who are destroying our countries.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see them try to justify their presence in OUR countries, when faced with that simple sentence:</p>

		<p>The more people are forced to undergo &#8216;diversity training&rsquo; the better. Nodody takes it seriously and all it does is confirm the increasing understanding among white people that we are being taken for a ride. It generally wakes people up to the agenda (if anyone is still in doubt) of guilt-tripping us with accusations of &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; - as opposed to &#8216;Chinese privilege&rsquo; in China, &#8216;Japanese privilege&rsquo; in Japan. et al.- and blaming us for everything that goes wrong in the lives of minorities.</p>

		<p>I see poster #1 has fallen victim to the propaganda of the &#8220;n&#8221; word. They use cracker, honky, redneck and worse directed at Whites all the time and if one doesn&rsquo;t know it yet, in the minds of those using those words they mean it as calling Whites the &#8216;n&rsquo; word. Words are words and one never used to get arrested for saying or thinking it nor considered to be a hater, a racist, etc. All the PC brainwashing we have accepted in this country is our downfall and we (Whites) are considered weak and passive by the nonwhites the world over. Who can fear or respect a race that rolls over and apologizes at the drop of a hat? Wake Up!</p>

		<p>The Amren synopsis is misleading, as it leaves out facts important to to understanding why the officer was suspended. According to the full article, the email in question included &#8221; a list of racist epithets&#8221; that was also sent to the 787 state employees.

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to know is why American Renaissance feels the need to mislead it&rsquo;s readership with edits that misstate the actual facts; creating the impression of victimization where none exists.  Heaven knows whites have enough real discrimination directed towards them without having to pull a &#8220;Sharpton&#8221; and defend behaviour that is, by white standards, indefensible. How many reading this would feel comfortable sending an email to a work distribution list that included racist epithets ( in this day and age ) and NOT expect consequences?<br>

<p>That certainly seems to be the case.  Ethnically/racially homogenous countries are currently  very out of fashion. <i>&#8220;There is no place in the modern [world] for ethnically pure states.&#8221; </i>  Everybody has to get scrambled. Those are orders from above!  Like it or not, your &#8220;elites&#8221; have decided that it is good for you.  Diversity will make you stronger.</p>
<p>That reminds me of Gen. Clark&rsquo;s statement on the matter in regards to Serbia which was trying to have its own country  for its own people.   Not allowed!!!  Try it, and you&rsquo;ll get bombed.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Let&rsquo;s not forget what the origin of the problem is. There is no place in modern Europe for ethnically pure states. That&rsquo;s a 19th century idea and we are trying to transition into the 21st century, and we are going to do it with multi-ethnic states.&#8221;</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think it was a bright idea to include a list of racist epithets, what he says about how police who shoot dangerous black criminals are always called racists is certainly true.</p>

<p>Actually it&rsquo;s the article that leaves out quite a bit, &#8216;racial epithets&rsquo; sent out to &#8216;756&rsquo; people&rsquo;? For all we know (judging by the article) this could be some kind of anti-hate literature, sent out by the SPLC even, part of an action plan listing ways to recognize, monitor, and prosecute &#8216;hate&rsquo; groups. The information is so sketchy here. Why might that be the case?</p>

		<p>Michael Sharkey #9: You (and some other commenters) are falling into the same trap that you accuse AR of setting. &#8220;&hellip;contains a list of racial epithets&#8221;?  You call that context?  To me, it sounds exactly as if the writer is trying to make something out of nothing.  Contains a list. Sheesh.  It&rsquo;s meaningless.  That&rsquo;s why AR editors considered it worthless.</p>
<p>For a bit of proportion, please note that comment #8 also contains a list of racial epithets.  I strongly suspect they&rsquo;re the same ones, too (can&rsquo;t swear to it, but I think I&rsquo;ve seen this email).</p>
<p>The trooper&rsquo;s only mistake was a mere slip of the finger that sent the email to a distribution list instead of himself.  Embarrassing, but understandable.  Certainly not enough to justify the loss of half a month&rsquo;s salary plus Diversity Training. And not enough that we should pile on to condemn him, either.</p>

<p>I HAVE read the original article. The sentence you refer to is pretty vague: &#8220;It [the Email] also includes a list of racist epithets.&#8221; What exactly does THAT mean? Did he refer to anyone by the epithets on the list, or did he simply catalogue them?</p>
<p>Without knowing more, I think you&rsquo;re premature in calling AmRen to account for posting the article.</p>

		<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gotten the e-mail in question.  It does include a &#8220;list of racial epithets,&#8221; but only as an example of things that whites can&rsquo;t say, but nonwhites CAN say.  The epithets are not condoned.  It&rsquo;s worded something like, &#8220;You can call us cracker, honky, etc., but what if we called YOU X, X, X?  That would be considered wrong.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I use a computer at the library in the town I live in, and when I try to go to a website like &#8220;white pride&#8221; or &#8220;caucasian pride&#8221; it is always blocked. So, I did some research and found a &#8220;black pride&#8221; website that was not blocked, also a &#8220;Latino Pride&#8221;, &#8220;Gay Pride&#8221;, and &#8220;Asian Pride&#8221; and none of these were blocked. Only the website for whites.</p>

<p>Ah, Saying white society isn&rsquo;t all that racist, is considered an example of racism, but saying a white person somewhere is a victim of racism, that&rsquo;s considered an even more serious breach of etiquette and an even greater example of racism, on the part of the white person. I think I got it. </p>
