<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Struggling to improve schools that have large populations of poor and minority students and under legal pressure to avoid racial busing, a small but growing group of school districts are integrating schools by income.</p>
<p>More than 60 school systems now use socioeconomic status as a factor in school assignments, says Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, which studies income inequality. Students in Champaign, Ill.; Kalamazoo, Mich.; and Louisville have returned this year to income-based assignments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of economic diversity policies hold up the school system in Wake County, N.C., as a national example, but voters who came out for a recent school board election turned against it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wake County bused students for decades based on race but switched in 2000 to considering income, one of the first in the nation to do so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies show low-income students do better in middle-class schools, Kahlenberg says. He says that&rsquo;s borne out in Wake County, where both poor and middle-class students have mostly outperformed their peers in other urban North Carolina districts  &mdash;  though scores have slipped lately.</p>
<p>He hopes Wake County will find a middle ground, perhaps like Cambridge, Mass., whose diversity plan offers a greater degree of choice for parents.</p>
<p>Assignment schemes in other communities vary. Champaign assigns children to elementary schools using individual factors such as parents&rsquo; incomes and education levels, Assistant Superintendent Beth Shepperd says.</p>
<p>Prodded by a 2007 Supreme Court decision that limited how districts could use race, Kentucky&rsquo;s Jefferson County Public Schools moved to assignments that consider a neighborhood&rsquo;s economic status, minority population and adult education levels, says Sheldon Berman, its superintendent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Integrating schools by income&#8221; is nothing more than a backdoor way to continue the policy of forced busing that has been utterly rejected by parents and sane teachers over the past 40 years.  People have realized that this policy does not strengthen the weak, but weakens the strong.</p>

<p>If this is true, then the reason why &#8220;low-income students&#8221; might be &#8220;doing better in middle-class schools&#8221; might be twofold:  (1)  Some poor whites, previously stuck in black districts/school boundaries, are going to white middle class schools and are therefore getting a better, less dumbed-down education, and/or (2)  Blacks are the ones being transferred, and white teachers are under administrative pressure to inflate the grades of their black transfer students.  If standardized testing is used to define &#8220;doing better,&#8221; then it means the school&rsquo;s administration is engaging in some sort of trick or skullduggery to keep the dumbest students home during testing week.</p>

<p>In fact, low-income students in Charlotte in &#8220;high poverty&#8221; schools outperform low-income students in bussed-for-diversity Wake County schools.  Data at link.</p>
<p>Scores up for black, poor teens in CMS<br>
In a striking change from 2004, those students now outperform counterparts in Wake, across N.C.<br>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: &#8220;In 2009, CMS black students had a 65 percent pass rate, 12 points above the state and 6 points above Wake&rsquo;s. CMS&rsquo;s low-income and Hispanic students outperformed the same groups statewide and in Wake, though by smaller margins.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If we want to group in a way that will produce similar performance, why not try something that may work like gouping by IQ ranges?  This could be done intra-school in large schools and inter-school for small schools.</p>
<p>The obvious problem is that the grouping will produce disparate results relative to race and culture.  Just listen for the cries of racism!</p>

		<p>grouping students by IQ is too sane to be taken up in PC America.</p>
<p>Especially since grouping students by IQ is remarkablz similar to grouping students by race, class, and ethnicity. </p>
<p>A white child with an IQ of 80 who does badly is just mentally slow. </p>
<p>A black child with an IQ of 80 who does badly is (somehow) the victim of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Leftists will never stop their various &#8220;forced&#8221; programs by using the power of government. That &#8220;IS&#8221; the reason they are dangerous. There is never a choice with them. They will decide how to shape your life and your childrens lives. They are social engineers at heart, always and forever experimenting and meddling with American&rsquo;s freedom to choose what is best for Americans. Yet, they have been successful beyond their wildest dreams and continue to be. That is why in my opinion, Republicans are utterly useless. They have never been a real force in stopping these tyrannts on the left.</p>

<p>I live in a good part of Wake County and paid a lot for this house to be here. The last thing I want is for my kids to be trapped in a school full of children displaying all the traditional minority pathologies for them to learn.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;moved to assignments that consider a neighborhood&rsquo;s economic status, minority population and adult education levels, says Sheldon Berman, its superintendent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You could safely bet Mr. Berman&rsquo;s children do not attend schools where non-Whites are bused in to attain &#8216;economic diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In S. California, ethnic and/or racial groups that do not want to send their precious children to violent, PC, government schools dominated by low quality hispanics or blacks are opening language-based, ethno-centric schools to educate their children and, more importantly, to avoid hispanics and blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics are not going to send their children to schools that are language-based in Armenian, Farsi, Korean, Chinese, Hebrew or Arabic (a new K-12 Syrian school just opened in my city).  The advocates of these race/ethnic-based schools claim they want to protect their heritage and language and are able to operate free of government interference.  They want to maintain their group cohesion and especially keep out &#8216;others&rsquo; particularly hispanics and blacks.</p>
<p>Woe be to any White that tries to open a Euro-Centric school.  The English language is the Achilles Heel of Native Born Whites  &mdash;  it unfortunately binds us with blacks.  If we used another language (Erse? Gael? German?), it would be far easier to separate ourselves from non-Whites in our neighborhoods and schools. One of my neighbors sends his children to a very expensive, exclusive French-language K-12 school.  The school advertises that it is language-based and my neighbor tells me it is exclusively White and more importantly, safe for White children.</p>
<p>I never seen blacks or hispanics demand Section 8 housing be put in Chinese neighborhoods  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m sure the Chinese would like to keep it that way.  Jared Taylor writes that we must find a way to make White neighborhoods and schools as uncomfortable as possible for non-Whites  &mdash;   as I see language-based ethnic groups doing in California.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to turn to White heritage languages to separate ourselves from non-Whites.  Nothing else is working and we Native Born Whites are in the government&rsquo;s sights for total destruction  &mdash;  of our homeland, our heritage and our wealth.</p>
