			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Neil, Los Angeles Times, November 10, 1009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The scene: A vast crowd at a political rally raises a tumult of adulation. Triumphal music rises. Graphics of President Obama&rsquo;s image slide across the scene as we hear the now-familiar voice say, &#8220;Change has come to America.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our moment is now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes we can!&#8221; The crowd chants. Slow pullback on the image of the White House. Announcer: &#8220;To commemorate the inauguration of our 44th president with a well-known American icon, introducing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Jingle: Chi-chi-chi Chia! Announcer: &#8220;Chia Obama!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next few seconds are some of the weirdest in the history of lese-majeste, as we see a terra cotta bust of Obama sprout a big green afro, one that happens to be rich in omega-3. Announcer: &#8220;Chia Obama makes the statement, &#8216;I&rsquo;m proud to be an American.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The staggering truth: Chia Obama is a real product, and its creator  &mdash;  77-year-old San Francisco ad man and Chia Pet magnate Joseph Pedott, a lifelong Republican  &mdash;  means it to be a sincere tribute to Obama, who he says has inherited &#8220;the biggest can of worms ever put on a president.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pedott has made a tidy living off the Chia Pet, a business he bought in the 1960s. If not an American &#8220;icon,&#8221; they are certainly familiar: little terra cotta sculptures (turtles, sheep, etc.) onto which you spread handfuls of moistened chia seeds. In a few days, the Chia Pet blooms in a nimbus of bright-green leaves, kind of like alfalfa sprouts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pedott awoke one winter night with a thought. &#8220;Is it possible to take a brand that nobody thinks seriously about and do something good for the country?&#8221; And  &mdash;  veteran adman that he is  &mdash;  he started to think about how to sell it. &#8220;Can I create a commercial that will help Obama do the things that I want done? To give Americans something to hope for, hold on to.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The short version of events is as follows: Pedott commissioned several prototypes  &mdash;  a three-president series (Washington, Lincoln, Obama), a smiling Obama and the determined Obama, and even an Obama-and-Hillary set. In March, the Chia Obama  &mdash;  &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a &#8216;pet,&rsquo;&#8221; notes Pedott  &mdash;  was test-marketed at Walgreens in Chicago and Tampa and was almost immediately pulled from shelves after the stores received complaints that the Chia Obama was racist (the big green &#8216;fro, don&rsquo;t you know). Pedott was stunned and disheartened.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chia Obama has subsequently been endorsed by such arbiters of political correctness as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and in May, Pedott personally gave the president a Chia Obama. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got green hair!&#8221; Obama laughed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even so, the Chia Obama has stayed off the shelves of major retailers, with the exception of Fred Meyer stores. Pedott found himself sitting on &#8220;truckloads&#8221; of Chia Obamas.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the direct-to-consumer ad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pedott says he simply wanted to create an inspirational spot that would transcend partisanship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something terribly winning about Pedott, a man too decent and sincere to see the ridiculousness of the ad, the product. You can&rsquo;t grow sprouts on the head of a Nobel Prize winner and not be accused of backhanded ridicule. You might as well carve an equestrian statue of Ronald Reagan out of Hormel ham.</p>
<p>Something winning also about his unwillingness to market the Obama Chia as patriotic kitsch  &mdash;  which is to say, to sell the product as a joke. Pedott seems incapable of that kind of cynicism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Why does it have to be either &#8220;Racist Scorn or Sincere Tribute?&#8221; What ever happened to the &#8220;tacky tchotchkes&#8221; that have been modeled after just about every other US President or world figure in recent memory? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, just off the top of my head I can think of the Hillary Clinton nutcracker, the Jimmy Carter peanut fishing lure (complete with oversized teeth,) the JPII Soap Pope On A Rope, a 1964 can of Barry&rsquo;s Gold Water, stacking Russian leader dolls, and bobbleheads for just about everybody who rose to fame in this century.</p>
<p>President Obama is hardly being singled out. He is being welcomed to a long, storied, and elite but not always tasteful, club.</p>

<p>Look, this is beyond laughable!</p>
<p>If Comrade BO himself is not offended, what is the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is what I like to call the self-appointed fun governors. Those ever beady eyed and perpetually offended oddities, that are so miserable about themselves and their lot in life, that they cannot stand to see anyone else even enjoy a hearty laugh or a pleasant holiday. These are the same kind of disturbed automatons, that go into spastic contortions of rationality and commonsense when they see a Christmas tree or the Easter Bunny. </p>
<p>In short, they are utterly beneath contempt; enough said!</p>

		<p>If you go to the original article by following the above link you will see a picture of the race hustler who wrote this piece of tripe. He&rsquo;s WHITE!!! He also appears to be a fairly young man, probably in his 20s. What motivated him to write this fluff piece is totally beyond me. Although it is quite likely that the college he attended to become an LA Times columnist fed him  regular doses of diversity and multicultural propoganda. And being impressionable (as young folks often are) he digested whatever nonsense he was told, and now it showing in his writings.  </p>

		<p>If a Chia Einstein were marketed (Has it been?) who would complain?  Jews?  Of course not.  Whenever one of these contrived controversies revs up, Obama should come forward and laugh it off.  He should have done so during the silly mini-uproar over the Curious George tees, for instance.  Any ethnic group that is consistently whining about every possible slight just breeds resentment on the part of other groups.</p>

		<p>Well all pros and cons weighed&hellip;. the bottom line is that while I don&rsquo;t see Obama as the Handsome Prince I often hear him refered to as&hellip;I did find the Chia thing a mockery of him. I got a kick out of it&hellip;but still found it a dig &hellip;most whites don&rsquo;t like the dissipation of our race&hellip; which is what he represents in loud colors.</p>
