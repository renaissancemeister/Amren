<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34122015/ns/us_news-washington_post/">Blacks Hit Hard by Economy&rsquo;s Punch</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>V. Dion Haynes, Washington Post, November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joblessness for 16-to-24-year-old black men has reached Great Depression proportions  &mdash;  34.5 percent in October, more than three times the rate for the general U.S. population. And last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that unemployment in the District, home to many young black men, rose to 11.9 percent from 11.4 percent, even as it stayed relatively stable in Virginia and Maryland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Construction, manufacturing and retail experienced the most severe job losses in this down economy, losses that are disproportionately affecting men and young people who populated those sectors. That is especially playing out in the District, where unemployment has risen despite the abundance of jobs in the federal government.</p>
<p><b>Last hired, first fired</b></p>
<p>Traditionally the last hired and first fired, workers in Spriggs&rsquo;s age group have taken the brunt of the difficult economy, with cost-conscious employers wiping out the very apprenticeship, internship and on-the-job-training programs that for generations gave young people a leg up in the work world or a second chance when they made mistakes. Moreover, this generation is being elbowed out of entry-level positions by older, more experienced job seekers on the unemployment rolls who willingly trade down just to put food on the table.</p>
<p>The jobless rate for young black men and women is 30.5 percent. For young blacks  &mdash;  who experts say are more likely to grow up in impoverished racially isolated neighborhoods, attend subpar public schools and experience discrimination  &mdash;  race statistically appears to be a bigger factor in their unemployment than age, income or even education. Lower-income white teens were more likely to find work than upper-income black teens, according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, and even blacks who graduate from college suffer from joblessness at twice the rate of their white peers.</p>
<p>Young black women have an unemployment rate of 26.5 percent, while the rate for all 16-to-24-year-old women is 15.4 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The economy&rsquo;s seismic shift has been an equal-opportunity offender, hurting various racial and ethnic groups, economic classes, ages, and white- and blue-collar job categories. Nevertheless, 16-to-24-year-olds face heavier losses, with a 19.1 percent unemployment rate, about nine points higher than the national average for the general population.</p>
<p>Their rate of employment in October was 44.9 percent, the lowest level in 61 years of record keeping, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment for men in their 20s and early 30s is at its lowest level since the Great Depression, according to the Center for Labor Market Studies.</p>
<p><b>Troubling consequences</b></p>
<p>Unemployment among young people is particularly troubling, economists say, because the consequences can be long-lasting. This might be the first generation that does not keep up with its parents&rsquo; standard of living. Jobless teens are more likely to be jobless twenty-somethings. Once forced onto the sidelines, they likely will not catch up financially for many years. That is the case even for young people of all ethnic groups who graduate from college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some studies examining how employers review black and white job applicants suggest that discrimination may be at play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black men were less likely to receive a call back or job offer than equally qualified white men,&#8221; said Devah Pager, a sociology professor at Princeton University, referring to her studies a few years ago of white and black male job applicants in their 20s in Milwaukee and New York. &#8220;Black men with a clean record fare no better than white men just released from prison.&#8221;<br>

<p>Such racism!</p>
<p>The racists no doubt will say that blacks would rather join gangs, sell dope, talk jive, rap, and steal, instead of working.  And they might even point to a national trend whereby blacks in this age group are attacking white people for fun and videotaping it.  But we know that&rsquo;s just all in fun, and everyone of them are potential scientists, CEO&rsquo;s and engineers, who are being held down by whitey.</p>
<p>Some racists even require that black males should be able to read on an eighth grade level and do fourth grade math, but that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re unreasonably biased.</p>
<p>No wonder Jeremiah Wright et all scream hysterically that black men are treated outrageously by this evil country.</p>

<p>That has been disproven.  The truth is the other way around.</p>
<p>The hard truth of the matter is that black unemployment was severly high before the recession.  It&rsquo;s worse than it was, but not much worse than it was.  White men have been most acutely hurt by the recession, in terms of unemployment now versus unemployment before.  The reasons are many:  Many stereotypically male jobs, like construction, have been cut back a lot.  But other reasons include blatant affirmative action discrimination, and tech job outsourcing to Bangalore or insourcing H-1B visa holders from Asia to do those jobs.</p>

		<p> Young black men certainly face discrimination in the workplace. It is real and very well deserved. I dont think I need to explain why to my fellow AmRenners. I own my own business. I have hired four black men in the past, all with disasterous results. I will not make that mistake again.<br>

		<p>Well, why is this some kind of surprise?  It&rsquo;s no surprise.  We know that ghetto blacks generally do not stay in school long enough to get a decent education, so that they QUALIFY to do some kind of work.  Nope, they&rsquo;re out there doing/selling drugs, having babies at 14, and starting on a life of crime by the age of 10.  All this takes precedence over education, which requires that you WORK for something.  In addition to that, the ones who are first fired and last hired have a victim attitude and an entitlement consciousness, which impresses a possible employer like a prospective employee showing up to an interview covered in dog dung.  Who needs THAT in the workplace!?  In AA, we say &#8220;Drop your expectations and improve your performance.&#8221;  That includes dropping your bad attitude.  Blacks will never get this because they aren&rsquo;t willing to take responsibility for their lives.  Easier to let the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t give them handouts. </p>

		<p>If WaPo cared about blacks, they&rsquo;d oppose mass immigration.  They don&rsquo;t, so obviously they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If the Washington Post cared about (ubiquitous phantom) white discrimination oppressing blacks, they&rsquo;d oppose integration.  They don&rsquo;t, so they don&rsquo;t (SWPLs pretending to care about blacks is about Red State vs. Blue State, screwing over lower and middle class whites, etc., not advancing black interests).</p>

		<p>I buy cars at dealer auctions and can assure you I&rsquo;ve never seen more than 3 blacks out of 1200 dealers. This is odd as it&rsquo;s far easier for a black living in the un-governed hood to get a dealer license than any of us crackers in uptight suburbia. What isn&rsquo;t easy is all the work and risk one takes when trying to out-smart all the other dealers trying to buy the car at the smart price. </p>
<p>I point this out because anyone with two brain cells knows than plenty of non english speakers, many illegal, have no problem making a buck. No job? Make your own. No natural ability? Get a AA job with the gubm-mint.</p>

		<p><i> &#8220;&hellip;race statistically appears to be a bigger factor in their unemployment than age, income or even education.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Oddly enough, race seems to be correlated with educational levels too.  Could the higher rates of dropping out of high school have something to do with higher levels of unemployment?</p>
<p>One factor that increased the unemployment is the increase in the minimum wage.  On July 24, 2009, the minumum wage went to $7.25 per hour.  The <i> Washington Post </i> doesn&rsquo;t mention that currently the minimum wage in the District of Columbia is $8.25.  That&rsquo;s a requirement to pay over $17,000 per year for a full-time, inexperienced high school dropoout.</p>
<p>When the price of something goes up, employers buy less of it.  When minimum wage goes up, teenage black unemployment goes up   &mdash;   every time. </p>

		<p> I would suggest everybody go to the original articles of all posted stories and read the comment pages. I swear it seems like 95% of the posters are fellow AmRenners. <br>
 There are far more of us than anybody thinks. GOOD READING INDEED. Many times I just read the article and get frustrated, but when I read the comment pages I feel much much better.</p>

		<p>Construction, manufacturing and retail were the hardest hit.  WELL DUH!  That&rsquo;s pretty much all job categories.  No construction because of the housing collapse brought about by liberal mandated loans to millions of unworthy, unreliable, bad credit minorities.  No manufacturing due to liberals outsourcing jobs to China, Mexico  and other foreign countries they pander to, while making it less and less attractive to American manufacturers to keep their plants in America.  No retail jobs due to the decline in folks with jobs resulting from manufacturing and construction collapse.  All brought about by liberal agendas and policies.  NOW they want to tamper with the ONLY really viable job source left - the medical profession.  Obamacare will destroy the last real job opportunities and stable employment venue left.  And why?  So minorities and illegals can get care they are not entitled to, not being citizens.<br>
The same folks who are bankrupting hospitals everywhere.  </p>

		<p>I once worked with a young black man, he came from Africa and hadn&rsquo;t even finished high school here in the US. The company had to hire at least one minority worker so he was lucky even to be considered for apprenticeship. To get this job most of the white guys had military experience and a couple years of trade school or college. This guy was the least experienced, least educated and did less work than anyone. The one thing that he was very good at was comlaining about the troubles of the black man. </p>
<p>He just couldn&rsquo;t understand why a young man with basically no education or training should have to do all that hard work. Instead of thinking that he was lucky to get a job that many people wanted he saw himself as oppressed. </p>
<p>The reason that most companies don&rsquo;t want to hire blacks is because you can only have so many blacks to provide color and then you have to hire some people to show up and actually do the work. </p>
<p>Before affirmative action companies already hired blacks that wanted to work and then they were forced to hire those that just wanted a check. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we eliminate the racial angle and investigate the employment prospects of people with IQs below 80, which is to say roughly half of the black population.</p>
<p>I believe we&rsquo;d find that their employment prospects and retention  rate are about the same as blacks overall.</p>

		<p>According to the MSM, minorities are always hit the hardest.  What&rsquo;s next - &#8220;NASCAR season cancelled, Minorities his the hardest.&#8221; In this economic situation, why would anyone hire a black?  Why would any employer with the choice of numerous qualified white males with college degrees and good work histories hire a black ex-con?</p>
