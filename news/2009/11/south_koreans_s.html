<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?_r=2">South Koreans Struggle With Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Choe Sang-Hun, New York Times, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [R]ival political parties in Parliament have begun drafting legislation that for the first time would provide a detailed definition of discrimination by race and ethnicity and impose criminal penalties.</p>
<p>For Mr. Hussain [Bonogit Hussain, a 29-year-old Indian man], subtle discrimination has been part of daily life for the two and half years he has lived here as a student and then research professor at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul. He says that, even in crowded subways, people tend not sit next to him. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Mr. Hussain said in an interview, &#8220;Whenever I&rsquo;ve walked with Ms. Hahn or other Korean women, most of the time I felt hostilities, especially from middle-aged men.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Korea, a country where until recently people were taught to take pride in their nation&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnic homogeneity&#8221; and where the words &#8220;skin color&#8221; and &#8220;peach&#8221; are synonymous, is struggling to embrace a new reality. In just the past seven years, the number of foreign residents has doubled, to 1.2 million, even as the country&rsquo;s population of 48.7 million is expected to drop sharply in coming decades because of its low birth rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Hahn said, &#8220;Even a friend of mine confided to me that when he sees a Korean woman walking with a foreign man, he feels as if his own mother betrayed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ethnic homogeneity is a blessing,&#8221; said one of the critics [of the proposed law], Lee Sung-bok, a bricklayer who said his job was threatened by migrant workers. &#8220;If they keep flooding in, who can guarantee our country won&rsquo;t be torn apart by ethnic war as in Sri Lanka?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Darker skinned races leeching off the lighter skinned ones. What else is new? They want your jobs, your education, your facilities, and your women. I guess the pale-skinned people to the east feel the same way that we do. I show supreme respect to those that show nationalism of any kind. It just spits in the face of the zeitgeist. And I&rsquo;m certainly going to go out standing up, not on my knees, like the billions of lemmings in the world, as they get consumed into the brown swarming vortex of globalism.</p>

		<p>Hi<br>
It appears Sth Korea and also Japan and China to a lesser<br>
 extent will be greeted with the conundrum of what happens to<br>
their culture and society as their populations gradually decrease and simultaneously cope with an increase in peoples from cultures substantially different from theres.<br>
Dont forget these countries are much more ethnocentric<br>
than Western countries and also much more aware of what  <br>
will happen with a large influx of immigrants from less developed countries&hellip;..read increased crime and other social dysfunction<br>
 On a short stay in Sth Korea many years ago I witnessed this several times<br>
For example once I was talking to a nice,friendly Sth Korean women in a bar in Seoul  who spoke good English and who was about to travel to the States.<br>
 Two local men nearby then started to talk to her in a rather belligerent tone.When I asked what they said she looked very upset and said they had called her a filthy whore and other nasty words  for just talking to me  .Unsure what to do next the two men then looked at me and bizarrely `apologized` in broken English and soon left after.<br>
Possibly being a Westener and acting in a `innocent` non threatening manner might have prevented this from escalating into a fight .But it also impressed  on me the clear ambiguous `love/hate` relationship many Orientals have to the West <br>
and deep suspicion and loathing of foreigners in general<br>
esp regarding relations with local women <br>
  <br>
 <br>

		<p> Despite the tsk-tsk, shamey-shamey tone of the article toward the Koreans for their &#8220;racist&#8221; attitudes, I think the bricklayer quoted at the end has a very good point. Why do the multi-culti crowd always think that a nation with overwhelming percentages of (relatively) light-skinned people   &mdash;   like European countries, or East Asian ones   &mdash;   has a moral obligation to darken itself up by admitting hordes of the swarthy from overseas? Why don&rsquo;t they ever decide that Nigeria is much too black, and should admit millions of Caucasians?</p>

		<p>The S. Korean women make it a point to go after foreign men, especially white men from the US. They simply want out. The fact that their men treat them horribly just adds to the problem. Does this mean American whites should seek out Korean women? No. The remarks the Korean men make about foreigners are the types of remarks that all whites should be making here in the US, the type of mindset whites should have. Some do have this mindset despite the 24/7 barrage of race-mixing propaganda from the elites and their blow-horn media. </p>

<p>The point here is that men from every race should be bitter/enraged when outside men date and have sex with their women.  </p>

		<p>A good test for whether this process should go further is to decide on what to name the indigenous Korean people. There will be Indo-Koreans, Afro-Koreans, Muslim Koreans, and then what &hellip;  True Koreans, Korea-Koreans? Names are important so if Korea can&rsquo;t get this right then Korea is heading toward big problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also recommend dissenting Koreans form organizations to halt this process and to defend the ethnic identity of indigenous Koreans. It can&rsquo;t be assumed that politics will get the job done. Massive public opinion opposing the changes will not be sufficient to stop the process. Leaders and organizations are necessary. Foreign organizations like AmRen or the BNP should offer to help since we would benefit if Korea took the lead in stopping the descent into multi-racialism.</p>

		<p>Once we&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re going to start calling the half-Asians the racist ones. Because once the half-Asians start breeding with each other it&rsquo;s bound to pop up some blonde haired highly intelligent types. Sigh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those half-Asians. I&rsquo;m a race realist. Whites really need to get their stuff together. And stop mixing with Asian women already. What the hell am I supposed to do now? Go to Asia? they don&rsquo;t like me because I&rsquo;m a Westerner, or at least look like me. I can&rsquo;t marry a white either, because that&rsquo;s inherently wrong.</p>
<p>Jeez, people, think before you miscegenate. It&rsquo;s really pathetic. </p>

		<p>Wayne Engle (#6) makes a good point.  I made a similar point on the GOP discussion board - which is anti-white. I pointed out that, if racial diversity is a good thing, we should want it for Africa as well (as long as we&rsquo;re sending billions in foreign aid).  The only coherent response: there is plenty of diversity among black Africans already.  To which I responded: there is plenty of diversity among whites as well, and yet that diversity is never officially recognized.  At that point I was banned from the forum.</p>

		<p>Well, what the article doesn&rsquo;t mention is that S.Korea&rsquo;s immigration laws are very strict. They don&rsquo;t let in immigrants unless they have a high educational status or are at the least students. In such a tiny country, even a small number of unskilled, low IQ immigrants can cause huge social problems.</p>

		<p>If only we had their problems!  Korea is still 98% ethnically Korean.  </p>
<p>Just looked up demographic stats provided on a couple of other sites&hellip; </p>
<p>Wikipedia gives the 2009 population of South Korea as 49.5 million, with 1.1 million foreigners, or 2.2 % of the population.  56% of those are from China, 31.7% of whom are ethnically Korean citizens of the PRC.  That&rsquo;s pretty nearly 200,000 and brings the number of ethnically non-Koreans in South Korea to about a million or a little less.</p>
<p>Not exactly a flood.   </p>
<p>Imagine my surprise to find further that 41% of new marriages with Korean farmers in 2006 were with women from southeast Asia!   Apparently it is only foreign men that disgust Koreans.  </p>
<p>Of course, it is far better to prevent a flood than to try to undo one, so the apparently unwarranted concern of Koreans about their still very healthy ethnic homogeneity is not entirely foolish but that is not even the issue of the bill currently before the Korean parliament.  </p>
<p>They are not debating whether or not to allow any more foreigners into the country, but how to clarify the legal boundaries of the treatment of those who are there.  </p>
<p>Asian countries are nothing like the White ones.  They are in no danger of treating minorities with special status and kid gloves.  It may well be important for them to clarify that foreigners do indeed have basic human rights, and be sure that those rights are respected. </p>
<p>When I say &#8220;basic human rights&#8221;, I mean it just like the words say, not like the crazy garbage we have in the USA where those words have been so twisted as to mean that blacks have the presumed right to stick whitey with the bill for as many children as they can produce, all their health care costs, their &#8220;rights&#8221; to have houses without paying for them (again, the bills are for the whites! ), &#8220;rights&#8221; to jobs they can&rsquo;t do and degrees they can&rsquo;t earn, their &#8220;rights&#8221; to trial by jury nullifying pals when they commit heinous crimes and all the rest of that garbage, so please don&rsquo;t be confused.  The situation in Korea is quite different.  </p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m jealous of their problems (at least this one. For ex., where is the Korean equivalent of Detroit? ).  Imagine a 98% white America.  If you are having trouble doing that, just take a look at the available demographic statistics for crime, academic performance and the numbers of those productively employed.  Consider also Section 8 housing, and the community reinvestment act and its fallout.  </p>
<p>As you may have surmised by now, I&rsquo;m not at all concerned for Korea&rsquo;s racial &#8220;struggle&#8221;.  They are fine.  It is we who are in serious trouble.  <br>

		<p>I have seen and heard of this sort of thing happening a lot in Korea (I have visisted several times for business). Korean men (particularly older ones, known as &#8216;adjossi&rsquo;s&rsquo;) shouting obscenities at Korean women walking hand in hand with westerners, or when a westerner talks to a Korean woman in public, Korean observers often approach her to &#8216;talk her out of&rsquo; anything she might be considering. Korean parents, too, are known for having major issues with their daughters marrying foreigners - I have several friends who found this out the hard way.</p>
<p>The approach may at times be a bit on the harsh side but I can&rsquo;t fault the sentiment. Unfortunately for them it looks like the sort of thing that will slowly start dying out with the older generations, and the growing liberalism.</p>

<p>Well what do you expect. You people don&rsquo;t like your women going with blacks.</p>
<p>But whites are hypocrites. Because when it comes to interracial sex, white men are the greatest sowers of wild oats in all of human history - they created the Mestizo race, and there is hardly a full blooded indigenous Australian or New Zealand existing these days.</p>
<p>The fact is whites had no compunction in miscegenating other races out of existence.</p>
<p>Now you complain that you are somewhat victims of some vast conspiracy to do away with the white race - which is utterly absurd.</p>
<p>After all there are about 1.1 billion whites in the world, not that far behind East Asians - and a heck of a lot more than blacks.</p>
<p>And if it is Caucasoids against Mongoloids, Caucasoids dominate.</p>

		<p>I got a similar reaction while walking around Xi&rsquo;an, China with a female guide.  We were confronted by a Chinese male.  I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this.  The only issue that I have is that alot of these same non-whites males who want to protect their own women, seem to feel that there is no problem with pursuing a White female.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, the name is &#8220;Ms. Hahn&#8221;.  I went to high school with a girl named Nancy Hahn, whose parents were immigrants from Korea.  She told me that Hahn was simply the German word for rooster (which, of course, I already knew), and meant that she was descended from a German sailor who had jumped ship in Korea a couple of hundred years earlier.

		<p>John Liu,</p>
<p> Why are you so hostile? Most of us are expressing sympathy towards the South Koreans who are experiencing the early stages of demographic displacement. I for one sympathize with them, and feel outraged at the UN&rsquo;s attempts at breaking down their notions of ethnic homogeneity. </p>
<p> And you speak of whites as if the entire race plotted to create the Mestizo race, which is not true, it was a group of conquistadors, who did not get any endorsements from the rest of white people. And we whites were subject to racial miscegenation long before any European colonization, read about the Moor invasions, or the Mongols. </p>
<p>As far as a conspiracy goes, this article makes me realize that the conspiracy is no longer against the white race alone, but against all races and ethnic groups. Right now white countries are primarily targeted, but now East Asian countries are on the chopping block. Soon the globalists will break down all ethnic identities by flooding every country will foreigners, and thus they will achieve the dream of one race of people. So much for diversity.</p>
<p>And why do you say Caucasoids dominate? In what?</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s native Korean (Han), just spelled with an extra &#8220;h&#8221; to emphasize that the &#8220;a&#8221; is long. The Parks in Korea aren&rsquo;t descended from some English sailor; it&rsquo;s actually &#8220;Pak&#8221;.</p>

<p>Moors were of Berber (or Arabized Berber) origin which didn&rsquo;t produce any racial admixture as Arabs in those times were completely Caucasoid, unlike North Africa today.</p>
<p>Mongol impact in Eastern Europe is negligible (far smaller than 1%). A lot of papers prove it, just google it.</p>

It&rsquo;s absurd to compare these tiny invasions with the whole mestizo/castizo population in Middle/South America.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Interesting, but highly dubious.   Han is VERY East Asian. Yes, Hahn does mean rooster (in German that is, nor Korean).  But  (having an interest in onomastics, the etymology of names),  I doubt a German origin for any Korean name.  First, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any German sailors going there &#8220;a couple of hundred years ago&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s historically improbable at a time when Germany was composed of  many small disunited principalities (until 1870).  No German ships (even if they existed) would have been going there; they wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed.  Korea, known as &#8220;The Hermit Kingdom&#8221;   was not opened up to foreigners until the late 1800s (when it came under Japanese control, but still not to others).    </p>
<p>The Korean naming system is also very different from the European. There are only about 250 Korean family names in current  use:  the three most common  being Kim, Lee, and Park, which are used by half the population.  Names tend to be very simple monosyllables.  Like Han. There are only about a dozen two-syllable surnames, and rare, all of which rank AFTER the 100 most common surnames.  </p>
<p>Hahn, (Han, Hann, Hahm,Hamm and other variants) is a regular Korean name with 3/4 of a million people carrying it. That would be a lot of descendents for one German sailor, even a rooster! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names</a></p>
<p>The Korean language doesn&rsquo;t use the Roman alphabet, so names get &#8220;romanized&#8221; when transferred into English orthography.   Also, names in Korea, by law,  must be taken from an officially restricted list.   This makes a Korean name of German origin extremely unlikely. Not even that.</p>
<p>And remember that there are Han Chinese too, and a Han dynasty.  Much more significantly, the <b> Han River  </b>, a major Korean river, flows through Seoul, a far more likely origin.  Seoul is in the Han valley.  There are lots of other possibilities   &mdash;   Han is such a simple word.  And in former times when most people were illiterate, a little &#8220;h&#8221; here or there meant very little.  Koreans wouldn&rsquo;t know how to spell a German name, nor would they use it.  I don&rsquo;t see any German connection. She was feeding you a fanciful story.</p>

<p>True, Europeans [some]  have mixed with other peoples around the world, wherever they found them  (such as Latin America)&hellip;. just as the Chinese have also done when in other places (such as  Latin America).</p>
<p>However, we  (at Amren)  are not responsible for what OTHER people do, or have done, as we do not control their behavior, only our own.  But we frown on it.</p>
<p>By the way, haven&rsquo;t you said you&rsquo;re in an inter-racial marriage?   The rest of us may honestly disapprove of racial mixing, without being  &#8220;hypocrites&#8221; as you call us.

<p>True. And if there really was a plot to miscegenate the white race (or any race for that matter) out of existence, then that would be wrong.</p>
<p>No problem in any two individuals finding and loving each other though. </p>
<p>But naturally in most cases, most people will marry people similar to themselves - this applies even to people from different regions in China - although of course to a lesser degree than it would to racial differences.</p>
<p>Thus no legal prohibitions are necessary against interracial relationships - because naturally they would be the exception, not the norm. And for those exceptions, in a normal society, that should be OK.</p>
<p>But the way things are now interracial relationships are pushed in the media, pushed by Hollywood, and are made to seem &#8216;cool&rsquo;, young people are actually making dating decisions based on race - which is racist.</p>
<p>But this of course is not just a new thing. Operas and movies about white men involved with Asian women, have been around for many years - from Madam Butterfly, to Sayonara, to the Karate Kid, whites seem never to have had much problem with this. </p>
<p>WN bemoan, justifiably, the propaganda enticing white women to mix with black men. But yellow men have been the victims of this sort of thing for years - at the hands of whites.</p>
<p>When I see the same outrage from White nationalists over white males with asian women, that I see over white women with black men, then I will stop calling some here hypocrites.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. I too have often wondered about this Liu character. He is a strange duck. He seems to have some pathological problems with White people. A handful of Conquistadors no more represent the White race then a Mafia family represents all of Italy. The homeland of the Conquistadors endured 700 years of Arab and Moorish conquest and enslavement before Cortez got up to speed (you think beautiful European women didn&rsquo;t get dragged into some Arab&rsquo;s harem Liu?). Look at what the Barbary pirates did to so many Europeans. How about the 500 year enslavement of the Balkans by the Ottoman Turks? Look at all the six-year old male children stolen from their vilages in the Balkans to become Janisarries and later used to kill and opress their own people. You think the Russians enjoyed being conquered by the Mongols? Or that Europe should be grateful to China for the bubonic plague? Or SARS? You say there are almost as many Whites in the world as Asians. BALONEY. You cite no facts for your 1.1 billion figure (never mind the very low White birthrates). But China alone has 1.4 billion people. Adding in Japan, Mongolia, the two Koreas, Philippines, southeast Asians, arguably Indonesia too, and Whites are nowhere in the same numerical quantity as Orientals. I don&rsquo;t know what your problem is but you contribute nothing to this website and offer no insight.</p>

<p>Europe: 700 million<br>
USA:  220 million<br>
Latin America: 204 million <br>
(35.63% of a total population of 572.7 million.)<br>
Canada: 30 million<br>
Australasia: 20 million</p>
<p>Total: 1174 million - over 1.1 billion. I won&rsquo;t link the sources - the figures are easy to verify.</p>
<p>Number of East Asians in the world i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Koreans (plus maybe some Thais and Viets) - about 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>So whites are playing in the same ballpark as East Asiatics, and both significantly outnumber blacks.</p>
<p>Of course if you want to expand your categorization to lump Indonesians, Filipinos, Malays etc, with Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans, we should then also include South Asians, Arabs, Persians, and North Africans as &#8216;white.&rsquo; After all Zinedine Zidane looks far more &#8216;white&rsquo; than does say Mahatir of Malaysia looks Chinese - and the genetic distance if far greater in the latter case than the former.</p>

<p>I think the reason why many white nationalists bemoan white woman/black man trends is because most white nationalists are male, myself included, and we&rsquo;re more likely to be sensitive to that combo due to our gender, for it makes us wonder why our own women would prefer men outside their own people. It stings emotionally and also makes us wonder if we are failing them as men. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, female white nationalists often bemoan the white male/asian female combo, which I think further illustrates my point. The white woman/black man combo stings us white men, just as the white man/asian female stings white women.</p>
<p>Still, I empathize with South Korean men who object to seeing foreigners with their women, and I sincerely hope that they continue preserving their ethnic homogeneity.  </p>
<p>I also wish you the best of luck with your marriage, for you are correct that for some interracial couples, it&rsquo;s not based on media-fed propaganda, but actual love. I recognize that. </p>

		<p>The race mixing promoted by Hollywood is primarily White women with Black men, not White men with Asian women.  And where was the White male/Asian female matchup in The Karate Kid?  It is a peculiarly slanted vision that sees a nonexistent mixed race pairing in a specific movie, but not the obvious message to White women throughout the mass media that mating with Blacks is desirable.  </p>

		<p>Nature thrives on harmony and symmetry, its only natural that self respecting men ackowledge this instinct within themselves and feel repulsed in seeing their women coupled outside of their kind. Variety within the race is the diversity to be admired not the misceginate variety that confuses and debases the race. Identity and purpose and mental health go hand in hand.</p>

		<p>Oh how I love the debates that rage on this site about the East-Asians! Seoul is the world&rsquo;s second largest city (at least until the next census in Shanghai). South Korea is heavily populated. There is NO ROOM for immigrants just as there is no room in Japan for immigrants. The only place more densely populated than South Korea is its neighbor, China; this and deepening trade ties are why Chinese might find homes in South Korea. I don&rsquo;t see any &#8220;Afro-Koreans&#8221; as there is no significant African population in Korea. Perhaps in a generation or two Koreans and East-Asians in general will become pathetic self-loathing nihilists bent on annihilation like Europeans, but in the meantime I don&rsquo;t see that happening. </p>

         When you write of race-mixing in south America giving rise to mestizos, you must remember the relationship between the indigenous and the Spanish was one of the conquered and the vanquished.<br>

         You misunderstand such operas and films as &#8216;Madame Butterfly&rsquo; and &#8216;The World of Suzy Wong&rsquo; etc.The leitmotif of those dramas is that they are all tragedies - they do not &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; miscegenation at all.The story usually is of two individuals of completely differing races and backgrounds being drawn into a fatal and doomed attraction with tragic results.</p>

		<p>If east Asian elites decide to sell their co-ethnics down the river as Europeans have done, they&rsquo;re even more screwed than we are, long term, barring something like a revival of ethnic nationalism in the west; east Asians are more conformist than we are, and they&rsquo;ll go like lambs to the slaughter.  Look how much more individualist Europeans are, and we&rsquo;re going like lambs to the slaughter, too.

I would like to thank people like him for making my whole life seem like a quandary and never feeling like I fit in. I would like to thank him for making feel as if I never have a country, a family, or a group of people to whom I can turn in case our tenuous society based on unnatural and forced multiculturalism collapses and is consumed, which it will be. I will like to thank him for not knowing quite what my children will look like because my genetics are a complete toss-up. I will like to thank him for having unusual features, having bad posture because my head is too large, my frame is too small, and having a slew of health problems. I would like to thank him for going my whole life being identified as something I&rsquo;m not: namely, Russian. I would like to thank him for my mother having a Caesarian section THAT LED TO A BLOOD TRANSFUSION THAT led to a Hepatitis infection that KILLED HER WHEN I WAS 14. </p>
<p>And all because my father thought he was &#8220;in love&#8221; with my mother. </p>

<p>Reading your post rather saddened me to learn that being mixed- race has caused you so much pain.  Don&rsquo;t feel bad about yourself for something that&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in miscegenation myself, but have three half-Chinese great-nephews on their mother&rsquo;s side, who are demonstrating good capabilities with regards to sports.  Thomas, the eldest, is a talented rower, both solo and team. Also he passed 13 GCSE exams this year with 6A pluses, 6 straight A&rsquo;s and one B grade.  </p>
<p>They are well adjusted lads and I am proud they&rsquo;re my great-nephews.</p>
