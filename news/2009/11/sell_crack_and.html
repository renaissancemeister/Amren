<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When we last looked into San Francisco&rsquo;s infamous &#8220;sell crack or die&#8221; case, Rigoberto Valle had been convicted and appeared to have a ticket for deportation without serving any more time behind bars, thanks to a judge who sympathized with the Honduran immigrant&rsquo;s tale of being victimized by human traffickers.</p>
<p>Valle, 23, had indeed spun quite a tale from the stand in September [see below], {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judge Teri Jackson, however, seemed convinced that Valle was indeed a victim of human trafficking, and indicated she would sentence him to time served and probation. At that point, the feds would take over and start deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>However, things have changed a bit since then. It turns out Valle has been arrested numerous times in the United States dating back several years, and had been deported at least five times before being arrested in San Francisco.</p>
<p>He first came to the United States in 2000, when he was 14, but was sent home for being here illegally. Two years later, he was back and was arrested for a string of trespassing crimes in Denver. He was convicted of a drug offense there in 2004 and was deported.</p>
<p>In 2005, Valle was caught trying to get across the border in Arizona, jailed for two months and deported.</p>
<p>He was caught again in 2006, allegedly trying to deliver heroin in Portland. Even though that case was not resolved, he was deported in 2007.</p>
<p>He was caught again and deported from Arizona in December 2008.</p>
<p>It was only a few months later, in June, that he was caught in San Francisco, dealing crack. He has been jailed ever since.</p>
<p>On Thursday, after citing what she called a &#8220;shocking&#8221; effort to mislead the court, Jackson told Valle she intends to sentence him to one year in County Jail on top of the five months he has already served, and put him on five years&rsquo; probation. She said that if he returns to the United States after being deported, he will face five years in state prison.<br>

<p>Valle&rsquo;s attorney, deputy public defender Hadi Razzaq, told jurors that his client is a victim who was brought to San Francisco by smugglers after a grueling journey by freight car and desert hike. Once here, he was ordered to sell drugs or be killed, Razzaq said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deceived, imprisoned, intimidated, victimized, terrified  &mdash;  ladies and gentlemen, Rigoberto Valle is not guilty,&#8221; Razzaq told the jury.</p>
<p>Razzaq said Valle, who is expected to testify in his own defense, had sold his house in Honduras to raise $1,500 for the trip to the United States. Once he got near San Francisco, the smugglers demanded $500 more, which Valle did not have, Razzaq said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They locked him up for three days, and on the fourth day in the Bay Area, they forced him to sell,&#8221; Razzaq said.</p>
<p>He had been on the corner of Golden Gate and Larkin just 10 minutes when he was arrested, the defense lawyer said.</p>
<p>Razzaq said he would call an expert on human trafficking to support his defense of Valle. His client, he said, came from a village of about 100 houses, is illiterate and came to this country to support his family.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was terrified  &mdash;  he had been duped, he was essentially kidnapped and locked in a room for three days,&#8221; Razzaq said. &#8220;He was quite literally in fear for his life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He wanted to come here, and sell dope.</p>
<p>But even if his &#8220;migration&#8221; were totally involuntary, the first place I&rsquo;d go to when I was dumped in the U.S. is to a police station.  I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t go into the crack selling business.</p>

		<p>After 24+ years clean and sober in AA, I know substance abuse pretty well, and what I see here is just your garden-variety crack junkie.  All junkies lie, cheat, and steal.  It&rsquo;s just part of the druggie and alky scene.  Of newcomers to our program, we say, &#8220;If his/her lips are moving, s/he&rsquo;s lying.&#8221;  And it is true - it was true of me when I got here; there are no exceptions.  Seems to me that the judiciary should learn something about substance abusers - the info is readily available and it just MIGHT stop some judges and even attorneys from being the enablers that so many of them are.  They make it easy for the junkie/alky to go back out and use, and that isn&rsquo;t doing anyone any favors.</p>

		<p>I used to live in San Diego, LA, Las Vegas, Texas and Colorado.  All of them have HEAVY illegal alien traffic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my experience that the vast majority of illegals will steal to get by, not the &#8220;few&#8221; who Geraldo Rivera and other liars in the media want us to believe is the case. </p>
<p>But theft is not the only problems they bring with them.  They drink HEAVILY and domestic violence occurrences are common place with knifings and bludgeoning incidents common practice.</p>
<p>Many of them take great pride in showing their knife and/or bullet wounds they received, mostly in bar fights.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to park a vehicle anywhere in the vicinity of their neighborhoods without have it ransacked of its contents sometime during the night.</p>
<p>Too bad the mainfringe media isn&rsquo;t privvy to that kind of diversity, except for Geraldo Rivera, however, because he could be beaten, mugged, robbed, burglarized, all on a daily basis for years and would still lie about the crime problem and chaos.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to interrogate him to see if any information could be obtained to find out why he is beset with the mental problems he has. He even changed his name from Jerry Rivers, I believe it was, to Geraldo Rivera, so great is his infatuation with mestizos.</p>
<p>Every leftist in this country is afflicted with some kind of mental disorder.  If we had been able to find out why earlier, we might have been able to prevent the situation that is destroying this country right now.<br>
