<h1>Racial Lines Define Results</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cameron McWhirter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, November 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mary Norwood swept predominantly white precincts of the city Tuesday, and also found support in key black precincts, while former state senator Kasim Reed dominated his base in southwest Atlanta and had a strong showing in predominantly black areas of northwest and west Atlanta.</p>
<p>City Council President Lisa Borders saw support collapse throughout the city, giving her a weak third-place showing.</p>
<p>Despite balmy weather Tuesday, turnout was low, even for an off-year election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many voters on the fence about Reed seemed to be convinced in the end he was their man. {snip}</p>
<p>With a run-off between Norwood and Reed set, their staffers will be poring over the precinct numbers in coming days to try to figure out how to capture Borders&rsquo; voters. {snip}</p>
<p>Now the two candidates have roughly a month to fight for every voter among an electorate that seems to be exhausted and mistrustful. And the ever-present issues of race, gender and class  &mdash;  which showed up throughout the campaign  &mdash;  likely will be amplified in coming weeks as the contest settles into one between a white woman and black man. Many Atlantans found the prospect unsettling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The town is divided in so many ways,&#8221; voter Ralph Dickerson said Tuesday, shaking his head.<br>

<p>Right here and right now, I will say that in pure political terms our worst enemies have a lot to cry about. The multicultural &ldquo;realignment&ldquo; and Marxist &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; that Comrade General Secretary BO was supposedly a harbinger of, seems to have been a just bit deflated last night. This is particularly true, when one considers New Jersey.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we (as race realists) won a major victory, but that the &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; and &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; lost some major battles. Sometimes, winning the war means simply watching your adversaries overextending and subsequently destroying themselves. </p>
<p>Well, these fools under the &ldquo;grand leadership&rdquo; of Comrade General Secretary BO and all his other media lickspittles and political cronies are certainly proving this. And they are doing it on multiple levels, like alcoholics who have suddenly discovered heroine.  </p>
<p>Just something to think about my friends!<br>

<p>Though Chris Christie wasn&rsquo;t much to write home about, his running mate, the woman who will be Lieutenant Governor, one heartbeat away from Governor, if not that then a credible contender for the U.S. Senate, is a woman who was the Sheriff of Monmouth County.  While she was Sheriff, she signed the county up for 287(g), which means her deputies and the county jail warden and guards were cross-deputized with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce immigration law.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The town is divided in so many ways,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Actually, the town is united more than you know. There are plenty of white candidates, who speak black and the language of entitlement, there are very few black candidates who speak white, and precious few, white or black, who talk to whites or try and act to win the white vote. </p>

<p>This article sums up what happened last night perfectly&hellip; and it was written almost two months ago.</p>
<p>SBPDL.com is a great site. I hope the person does a follow up based on what happened yesterday soon.</p>

		<p>If you look at the numbers it is obvious that Norwood won easily.  But Atlanta has this were rule that says you have to have 50% or more to actually win or there will be a runoff with the #2 candidate.  This is part of the reason Atlanta has had such an uphill climb in trying to get a responsible white mayor.  The system itself is skewed against Norwood and knowing this town the way I do I seriously doubt the runoff will help her in any way.  The only way she will get elected is if someone can show the Blacks in Atlanta what a buffoon Kassim really is (not likely).<br>

		<p>To Question Diversity,</p>
<p>Thanks for the very informative post above. I must say that what you wrote about the new Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, was both interesting and a bit exhilarating. Indeed Governor Christie might be an oaf of the soft &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; sort, but hopefully Mrs. Guadagno will have a highly positive influence on him.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for a very positive and bracing post QD,</p>
<p>John PM!<br>
