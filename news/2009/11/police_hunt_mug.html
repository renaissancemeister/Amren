			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graham Smith, Daily Mail (London), November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A cowardly mugger who punched a two-year-old girl in the face when her mother refused to give up her handbag was being hunted by police today.</p>
<p>Maria Sharma, 28, was pushing her twins Paris and Sunny along a busy road in Slough, Berkshire, when the vile attack took place in broad daylight.</p>
<p>A man, who Mrs Sharma described as &#8216;looking possessed&rsquo;, tried to snatch her handbag, which was hanging from the toddlers&rsquo; pushchair.</p>
<p>When the single mother-of-four fought back, he crouched down and punched Paris full in the face.</p>
<p>Maria Sharma and her daughter Paris</p>
<p>&#8216;Animal&rsquo;: A mugger punched two-year-old Paris Sharma in the face while trying to steal her mother Maria&rsquo;s handbag</p>
<p>He then again attempted to run off with Mrs Sharma&rsquo;s handbag, but its strap was caught around the pushchair&rsquo;s handle and he ended up dragging the screaming children along the pavement.</p>
<p>The man stole her purse and keys before running off.</p>
<p>Both children were injured in the attack, which left Paris covered in blood with a split and swollen lip and scrape marks across her face. She was taken to Wexham Park Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Mrs Sharma said: &#8216;He went to snatch the bag from the handle of the pushchair.</p>
<p>&#8216;My automatic reaction was to not let him have it. We were struggling for a minute and then he released and I thought he was going to run away.</p>
<p>&#8216;But he went to the front of the pushchair, crouched down, clenched his fist and punched my daughter in the face.</p>
<p>&#8216;The twins instantly both started screaming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Sharma was also left severely bruised after struggling with the attacker, described as a black man in his early twenties.</p>
<p>She said today: &#8216;I keep beating myself up about it. I keep thinking, should I have given him the bag or should I have hit him?</p>
<p>&#8216;I feel like a failure as a mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police officers investigating the Tuesday lunchtime attack took swabs from Paris&rsquo;s face in an attempt to identify the suspect through DNA profiling.</p>
<p>Detective Constable Gareth Warr said: &#8216;The woman and her children have been left very shaken by this attack.</p>
<p>&#8216;As it happened in the middle of the day, it is likely that there were people in the area that may have either witnessed the incident or saw some suspicious activity. I would urge them to get in touch.</p>
<p>Mrs Sharma added: &#8216;The twins are so traumatised, every time someone knocks at the door they scream. They are not sleeping properly and they are not eating as much as they used to.</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&rsquo;t believe anyone would do that. You hear about people attacking a woman all the time, but to attack a child, I can&rsquo;t even put into words how I feel about this man.</p>
<p>&#8216;I hope anyone who knows him and what he&rsquo;s done will turn him in and he is jailed for many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man is described as black, with short hair, 5ft 7ins tall, of stocky build and was wearing a black shiny puffer jacket and black Adidas trainers.<br>

		<p>No doubt the lefty apologists will say that this mugger was desperate for his next &#8220;fix&#8221; and so acted out of desperation. But that always raises the question of why blacks who are in dire poverty can always find a way to get ahold of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>I predict that the woman and her family will move out of the area within a year. And so goes the beginning of white flight.</p>

		<p>She &#8216;feels like a failure as a mother&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The failure is the government policies and PC social engineering that permitted these &#8216;black Britons&rsquo; into the country in the first place.  It&rsquo;s her own parents who didn&rsquo;t raise her properly - look at the photo in the original article;  mother is blonde, little Paris is much darker. If people will insist on not seeing what&rsquo;s before their eyes, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to help them.</p>
<p>Logic is a good system, but it depends on getting the facts right.  With false premises, you can construct a perfectly logical argument to prove anything you want. That&rsquo;s why leftists are completely impervious to logic.</p>

If you look at the pictires in the original article, you can see that not even the mother is white, or at least I wouldnt consider her white. And the offsping also does not classify white by any standards. </p>
<p>They should flee not only from city but from the island and from europe as well.</p>

Thank you. I was wondering what sort of people Sunny and Paris Sharma might be.  Certainly not very English!</p>
<p>Not surprising.  But I am very surprised that the newspaper actually described the perp. as a black man.  Is this permissible when non-white attacks non-white?  </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anything about Slough, so I had to look it up. Checking Wiki,  I find that it&rsquo;s &#8220;the most ethnically diverse local authority area  in the UK  outside of London.&#8221;   I also  find that it&rsquo;s only 62% white.   (I wonder if they would categorize Ms. Sharma as &#8220;white&#8221;?)<br>
Slough is England&rsquo;s least tranquil area.  <br>
Slough has a high crime rate, with figures for all crime statistic categories above the English average and figures for several categories more than double the English average!  <br>
Slough is the least safe Crime and Disorder  area and has the highest level of anti-social behavior   in the whole of the Thames Valley.</p>
<p><br>
After reading all of the above, and looking at the picture of Ms. Sharma, I  am left  wondering why I should continue to have any worry about the land of my ancestors.  These people certainly aren&rsquo;t any kin of mine.   It&rsquo;s a totally foreign land.<br>

		<p>The mother might be categorized as vaguely white by the present British standards, but the child is by no means white. However, if the mugger was described as black in the police records, he was probably VERY black. I wonder what his excuse will be, if and when he gets caught. He has no &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; like the  blacks here in America have to try and justify running amuck.</p>

		<p>The mother isnt &#8216;vaguely white&rsquo; at all. Her hair is dyed blonde. Both mother and child are Indian Hindus. Sharma is a Hindu name. Most Indians in the UK are from North India (although there is an ever growing presence of South Indians). Most Indians in USA are from South India because that is where the high-tech industries are based. </p>

		<p>I used to live near Slough, its a horrible town, the original The Office(UK)series was set there to emphasise the dreary uninviting nature of the place. What makes it worse that it has become an Asian(Pakistani Muslims)/Black town, many neighborhoods are totally non white, mosques are everywhere,the streets are full of 3rd world traders; if you walk out during the day you might see the odd white pensioner looking lost amongst a sea of Asians and Blacks, or the odd young white who looks like a long-time welfare recipient. And needless to say you don&rsquo;t walk out at night. <br>
What happened to this woman, who is clearly Indian or Pakistani was horrible, but she&rsquo;d better get used to it. Her parents likely came to the UK for a better life; trouble is the millions who followed them came in such numbers that they were able to bring and practice their primitive traditions. People from the Indian sub-continent have little respect for females. We&rsquo;ve all read about the forced marriages, family honor killings etc. If that is their way let them practice in their own homelands, leave us to our ways. Blacks are no better.<br>
We here at Amren know this will never get better, perhaps in 500 years some White Europeans will rise up and expel this cancer infecting all our homelands.<br>
 It is so remarkable that we are witnessing the dismantling of a civilization before our very eyes and we seem so helpless. God knows the free world needs a leader before its too late.<br>
Arc.</p>
