<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=117083">Illegal Alien Burns Elderly Woman Alive, Now Gets Life</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily, November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal alien has been sentenced to life in prison for breaking into an 83-year-old woman&rsquo;s home, grabbing her by the throat, smashing her head into furniture, saturating her with gasoline and setting her body on fire while she was still alive  &mdash;  all to cover up his check-fraud scam after she hired him to cut her lawn.</p>
<p>Ramon Alvarado, 33, and his cousin, Jose Alvarado, 37, were hired to do yard work for Lila Meizel at her home in Wheaton, Md. They worked for the woman for two years, and Meizel often gave the men soda, food and extra tips.</p>
<p>Jose&rsquo;s wife, Ana Rodas, 33, was also arrested in connection with the murder that took place the day before Thanksgiving last year. Ramon was convicted of murder, arson and conspiracy in October. On Monday, he was sentenced to two consecutive life terms  &mdash;  one without parole  &mdash;  plus an additional 30 years for arson.</p>
<p>A Montgomery County jail official confirmed that all three were illegal aliens. According to reports, they are from El Salvador and have lived in the United States for more than 10 years. The Gaithersburg Gazette reported Immigration and Customs Enforcement had detainers on all three defendants, flagging them for possible federal charges and deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Meizel gave the men a $75 check for landscaping work. Jose added two zeros to the number, agreeing to give his cousin $1,200 and Rodas $1,000. They used the $7,500 to buy a car, computer and clothes. Ramon and Jose pre-emptively conspired to kill Meizel when the two believed they might be caught.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Ramon and Jose Alvarado had previous criminal records in Montgomery County. Jose had a history of check fraud, according to the Washington Examiner. Ramon had a warrant out for his arrest for driving a car without a license or registration. Rodas had no criminal history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed Ramon caused Meizel to suffer a brain hemorrhage and fractured seven of her ribs. She had soot in her lungs and burned tissue in the back of her throat, indicators that she was alive when he set her on fire. Most of her body was charred and her face was unrecognizable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inhumane manner you chose to exterminate a lady well into the autumn years of her life strongly suggests that you are sadistic,&#8221; Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Terrence J. McGann told Ramon Alvarado. &#8220;A civilized society demands that you be in prison for the remainder of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the report, Ramon Alvarado spoke only about his concern for his mother.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meizel&rsquo;s daughter described her mother as &#8220;a very trusting woman,&#8221; saying she was satisfied with Ramon&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it came to hiring people for her lawn, she was happy with this man,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just after Meizel&rsquo;s murder last year, WND reported another case where an illegal alien fatally beat a 64-year-old woman who gave him a home. In December, Julio Cesar Ramos  &mdash;  who had been deported more than a dozen times  &mdash;  was charged with first-degree murder after allegedly beating Paulette Locklear to death when she took him in, built a small house on her property for him, gave him work and treated him like family.</p>

		<p>These stories should be a warning to liberal Whites that taking in mestizo&rsquo;s is a bad idea. They are not like us. But for decades the churches these elderly Whites go to have been preaching to them that they are &#8220;just like us&#8221; and &#8220;Jesus would want you to take care of them&#8221;. This is more ammunition for the anti-religious race realist/White Nationalist among us.</p>

		<p>More 3rd World barbarism. Has anyone ever heard of &#8216;plague of death&rsquo; in Gautemala? Hundreds of homicides and almost none of them solved. Maybe this is a cultural throwback to the Pre-Columbian societies of Central America? </p>

		<p>Outrageous crimes by illegal aliens are becoming common.  Despite this, many cities still declare themselves sanctuary cities and refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.,  San Francisco is classic in its policy to protect illegal aliens who are minors.  However, things seem to be changing, even in SF. Pressure mounted when a San Francisco woman pushed for deportations after her husband and two of their sons were gunned down by an illegal alien gang member who was twice arrested for violent crimes as a youth but protected from deportation by the sanctuary law. The SF mayor is now trying to reverse this law but only after he decided to run for the governship of California. AND, It doesn&rsquo;t look like we can turn to the Obama administration to enact stronger policies regarding the illegal invasion.</p>

		<p>First I&rsquo;ve ever heard of this story. Had no clue who Lila Meizel was until just a few minutes ago. But I know who James Byrd, Emmett Till and Medgar Evers are. Odd that. I have asked many people if they have ever heard of Channon Christian or Christopher Newsom and I have yet to find one person who has ever heard of either. </p>
<p>Apparently the media is very selective in their coverage of murders. It appears that these journalist&rsquo;s, who almost to a man will tell you that skin pigmentation is irrelevant, choose what story gets covered, based on skin color. </p>

		<p>Traitors who hire illegal aliens dont get a lot of sympathy from me.And so called do gooders, such as Paulette Locklear get even less.They are trying to get a real good deal by hiring them, but all of the rest of us 9 to 5 working stiffs end up paying all the huge cost of the hordes of children that they have, and all of the welfare and health care that they get for free.And a lot of those who hire them are filthy rich. </p>

<p>I just wonder if this woman has learned a lesson from all this or will she hire mestizos for her yard work instead of the many white men who are in the business.</p>
<p>The woman killed paid the ultimate price for her error.  I&rsquo;m sorry to say she just wasn&rsquo;t bright enough to care where these people come from and that they have an entirely different set of values than whites.</p>
<p>I would NEVER hire a mestizo, legal or not.  NEVER!<br>

		<p>Another non-hate crime that will never be widely reported because it didn&rsquo;t involve weak and shaky accusations by a non-white towards some white males or a swastika painted on a door or a noose hung from a door, presumably by white males but almost always by non-whites trying to stir up hatred against white males, with the later correction regarding the hoax crime put on the back page after the truly inflammatory white male bashing was on the front page for a week. </p>

		<p> The darker races simply seem less cerebral, more impulsive and more survivalistic.. there was a large emphasis in the Old Testament for the more refined people not to mix blood with the more fleshly..(breeding). and yes..I&rsquo;m sure Christian religion comes to peoples minds&hellip;&#8221;Blessed are the poor&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;I was hungry an you fed me&#8221;.. &#8220;cold and you clothed me&#8221;&hellip; It is hard to digest how God would tolerate those acting selflessly to do his will, to be brutally violated.?.. My opinion is that Jesus was not talking in Maxims but likely to particular circumstances in his times where the poor were essentially enslaved,.. perhaps partially due to refusal to compromise justice to escape poverty. I also think people need to realize Jesus also spoke viciously ..&#8221;kindling a fire&hellip; bringing enmity between father and son&hellip;&#8221; The peace he spoke of was only possible with strong virtue not with decadent emotional naivetee. The fact is..many of the poor&hellip;are simply horrid scoundrals that prey on those that try to help them, and as I see it should be allowed to reap as they have sown&hellip;</p>

<p>No, a civilized society would demand that he be hanged by the neck until dead.</p>
<p>A just society would have him burned alive.  But, then, a little justice goes alongways.</p>

		<p>Seems that mexicans and blacks like setting White people on fire of late. Think there will be a &#8220;White In America&#8221; show on CNN in the very near future? I think most of us here know WHY the media ignores all these types of crimes against Whitey. It doesn&rsquo;t fit their plan or agenda for us to know. Now, why do you suppose that is?</p>

		<p>Another incident that shrieks &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; but is not prosecuted as one.  Why didn&rsquo;t two apparently strong and healthy young men smother the elderly woman to death with a pillow?  And how did one manage to cash that jimmied-up check?

		<p>In this case, although I don&rsquo;t believe in capital punishment, I would recommend &#8220;an eye for an eye.&#8221; Short of that, how about solitary confinement for thr rest of his life, with no chance of parole? No &#8220;benefits.&#8221; Just four walls to look at and contemplate his actions for the rest of his miserable life.</p>

<p>Christianity has done a lot more good for white people than not. Without it, the Muslims would have swept Europe and we would all be bowing down and praying to Allah. Disparate little bands of pagans weren&rsquo;t going to stop the Muslims. Christianity provided a worldview for Western Civilization that coalesced white nations and peoples back into empire after that fall of the ancient Roman Empire, created an environment that allowed modern science to arise, developed a fair rule of law and civilized societies that we still enjoy today (and which you make every effort to couch in purely racial terms ignoring that worldview also play a part), etc&hellip;</p>
<p>You speak as if modern evangelical Christianity is the only form of Christianity that has ever existed. In my opinion, your understanding of Christianity is myotic and historically misinformed. It was the Christians who beat back the Muslims, conquered/converted the disparate pagans into a force the world had to reckon with, and kept non-whites in their place. But you apparently don&rsquo;t seem to know about any of this.</p>

<p>A civilized society protects its women, children, and economic health by protecting its BORDERS! Every one of these crimes should expose the US Government, Homeland Security Department, and the ICE to wrongful death liability.

<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with you, Mike   &mdash;    not basically   &mdash;    but I do have a  couple of minor points to quibble about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the journalists themselves who choose what  to write about.  It&rsquo;s the newspaper MANAGEMENT who choose what  stories they will  cover.   And what they will NOT! </p>
<p>Also, I happen to agree that &#8220;skin pigmentation is irrelevant.&#8221;   It&rsquo;s true.  No freckle ever murdered anybody.   It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside the skin that counts.  It&rsquo;s race that&rsquo;s relevant.  Skin is just on the surface, but race runs all the way through.</p>

<p>I too noticed that shockingly casual comment   &mdash;   a compliment in fact!   &mdash;   about the men who burned her mother alive!   She was essentially recommending a milder sentence for them, speaking well of them!   Amazing.   She should have been boiling with rage; she should have given them no good word at all.  I suppose she thought she was being &#8220;fair&#8221;, so brainwashed was she after years of sermons about loving   thy neighbor and turning the other cheek.    Well, there&rsquo;s a time to stop being fair.   If someone murdered my mother, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about being &#8220;fair&#8221; with them!   Where they fair to HER?</p>
<p>And I was equally astonished by the weak, limp comment of the judge, who didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp the enormity of the crime either. .  It  &#8220;strongly suggests that you are sadistic.&rdquo;    Huh?  Well, well.  So it APPEARS that they just might be sadistic.  Can you imagine that?  Who would have guessed? </p>
<p>No, judge Dimwit!   Sorry.   It does not &#8220;strongly suggest&#8221; that they could  be or might be sadistic.    It CLEARLY PROVES that they most definitely are!</p>
