			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Los Angeles Times, November 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Very few African Americans have used Los Angeles County&rsquo;s free H1N1 vaccine clinics, public health officials told county leaders Tuesday, raising concerns about outreach to a community that, as a group, has a high risk for serious flu complications.</p>
<p>Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, the county&rsquo;s public health director, expressed disappointment in the turnout by blacks but said he did not think the problem was a lack of clinic sites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African Americans received 2.57% of the initial 60,773 vaccinations countywide, although they make up about 9% of the county population, according to public health figures released Tuesday by Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.</p>
<p>Within the South Los Angeles service area, where African Americans make up 32.4% of the population, they received 10.89% of the vaccines, county health records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although public officials chose locations throughout the county in hope of reaching diverse populations, the clinics were open to anyone. County statistics show that more Asians than African Americans were vaccinated at clinics held at South L.A. County locations. Asians make up less than 2% of the population in that area, according to county statistics.</p>
<p>Overall, Asians account for 13% of the county&rsquo;s population but made up more than 27% of those vaccinated at the first county clinics. The Los Angeles Times/USC College of Letters, Arts and Sciences poll of California voters found that Asians, by far, were the most likely to say they planned to get vaccinated. Whites and Latinos also were vaccinated at public clinics at rates lower than their overall county populations, but not by nearly as wide a margin as blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Blacks and Latinos are among those most at risk from H1N1 flu, primarily because they suffer disproportionately from asthma, diabetes and other health problems, and are four times more likely than whites to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu,</p>
<p>Loretta Jones, chief executive of South L.A.-based Healthy African American Families, said many patients she serves do not know where to get the vaccine and also question its safety. Some blame the distrust on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which lasted from 1932 to 1972, in which federal researchers withheld treatment from black men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Few African Americans stood in line at a county flu clinic at USC last week. Several black students walked by without stopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;I keep hearing the cases of people getting sick from the shot,&#8221; said Bridgette Jackson, 22, a senior from Riverside. &#8220;I&rsquo;d just rather get the flu.&#8221;</p>

		<p>My mother worked in an elementary school for a few years.  Around Christmas they would put together food and clothing and toy packages for the &#8220;underpriviledged&#8221; and &#8220;hunger victims&#8221; (she loved that term, given the fatness of these &#8220;victims&#8221;).  These people, overwhelmingly black, had somehow gotten on charity lists.  Anyway, the school would call up these people, and they&rsquo;d demand the school deliver all this directly to their door.  These families were chosen because they were near the school, yet they couldn&rsquo;t get their lazy bodies the at most 5 miles to pick up what other had donated to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s largely the same thing here: they&rsquo;re lazy and they don&rsquo;t care about their kids.</p>

		<p>Blacks have been warned by their leadership not to take the vaccines because whitey is trying the exterminate them through the vaccination process. When blacks die en-masse due to the flu epidemic, then the same black leadership will claim that whitey witheld the vaccines from them. </p>

		<p>Actually, vaccines are NOT good for you.  Given that there&rsquo;s possibly mercury and squalene in those shots, and given that the H1N1 flu is mild and those who died from it nearly always had other health problems, I&rsquo;ll take my chances with the flu.  I&rsquo;d rather have the flu for a couple of weeks than some autoimmune disorder for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I have a child that&rsquo;s on the autism spectrum and I strongly suspect that his vaccinations are responsible.</p>

		<p>Agree 100% with comment #2.  Their leadership always seems to think any new prevention of disease is another way to &#8220;thin the African race&#8221; and so they shout to the world for blacks not to take any action to help them. However, a new hair process or skin whitener will receive mass approval by the majority of blacks both in the inner city and suburbs.  The asians continue their advance while blacks cry about slavery.   Disgusting. </p>

There is much evidence that vaccines are not all they are cracked up to be. Obama and his children have not gotten them either.

<p>The problem is NEVER the lack of clinics, the lack of vaccine, etc. The problem is a laziness, a sluggishness of mind, and just I-don&rsquo;t-give-a-damn attitude toward life in general. &#8220;A bag of chips will get me through this and I might be shot during a drive-by tomorrow rather than die from Swine flu&#8221;! NO real concern for health or even the slightest degree of curiousity about wellness or preventative measures ever.</p>

		<p>Blacks may be correct on this one but only in a &#8220;Even-a-broken-clock-is-right-twice-a-day&#8221; way.  Yes, they&rsquo;re better off without the vaccine but it&rsquo;s not as if they did their research and thought it over and weighed they&rsquo;re option.  They didn&rsquo;t suddenly put on their reading glasses and stroke their chin and talk in a British accent.  It was more a matter of being right for the wron reasons: 1) laziness 2) why come they don&rsquo;t come and pick us up and take us to the clinic? 3) rumors, false information and bad science 4) community leadership scaring them with nonsense.</p>
<p>If life is a math test, they got the answer right but their work shows they got their in all the wrong ways.</p>

		<p>Seems to me that Asians trust their government more than they should.  Probably due to their overall group mentality.  Like Alexandra and Cogetator, I also agree with those blacks who distrust the government and the vaccines it so furiously promotes.  I&rsquo;m suspicious of ANYTHING the government promotes (aside from the basic common sense ones); more than likely, their true motives are either to harm us or help the well-connected make a lot of money.</p>

		<p>Anyone who expresses surprise that urban blacks are suspicious of this vaccine must have just arrived from Pluto.  And, in this case, any thinking person should have reservations.  It seems to me that the whole process is being rushed without the usual safeguards, and some of the vaccine is reportedly being manufactured in China.  Anyone old enough to recall the problems with the vaccine in the previous swine flu outbreak is probably reluctant from the get-go.  All the hoopla that the media has been engaging in over this has probably not helped confidence either.  My local, small-city newspaper has headlined above-the-fold on the front page each time (twice) an unfortunate has died in an area encompassing hundreds of miles.  </p>

		<p>Seems the blacks got this one right, but for the wrong reason. Relating their fear of getting the flu shot to the Tuskegee study is inane. However, in regard to the government&rsquo;s track record with respect to public safety, taking a mystery vaccine would be the fool&rsquo;s wager. Thanks but no thanks.</p>

		<p>AmRenners have got the politically incorrect reasons for blacks&rsquo; non-participation pegged, as usual. I agree with those who say the benefits of the vaccine are dubious, at best. But the reasons the blacks aren&rsquo;t making the effort to get the vaccine is because you can&rsquo;t spend, eat, drink or barter it.</p>

		<p>Everyone that pointed out A) Offering charity isn&rsquo;t enough, you actually have to bring it to their door; and B) They believe that the government is trying to give them AIDS through these vaccines give yourself a round of applause.  You&rsquo;re absolutely spot on.</p>
<p>As part of the healthcare coverage, one publication showed what happened when basic medical treatment was offered at The Forum in Inglewood; hundreds of people showed up and it was highlighted as an example of how desperate people were for basic healthcare needs.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with Inglewood knows who lives there, and I assure you that the demographic is largely on welfare and covered by Medicare and Medicaid; they were simply too lazy to go get it until it was practically brought to their back door.</p>

		<p>The main problem, of course, is that the shots are free   &mdash;   IOW, no money changing hands, therefore no pile of cash sitting around at the clinic. If patients were charged as little as $1, eventually there would be enough money in the till for some black (or group of blacks) to steal. No loot = no interest.</p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t getting the  vaccine because it is &#8220;Whitey&#8221; up to something. Later when they become ill in disproportionate numbers, it will (again, of course) be &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s&#8221; fault. As I have always said, when your dealing with blacks, you just can&rsquo;t win.</p>

When the Amreners and a large segement of the Black community can agree on an issue something very wrong must be happening.</p>
<p>Top German officials seem to be getting a different version of the vaccine than the general public:</p>

		<p>Reply to Alexandra:</p>
<p>Not all vaccines are bad.  There are some countries around the world that you need to get certain vaccines before visiting there.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine, may, or may not, be a good idea.  Maybe it is better to take your chances with the flu and build up your immune system.</p>
<p>But this still does not mean that all vaccines are bad and unnecessary.  Some vaccines are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The best example is that prior to the advent of the polio vaccine in the 1950&rsquo;s, it was very common to see many people having to wear leg braces, be in wheelchairs, or be condemned to having to live an iron lung, as a result of this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>Actually, Obama&rsquo;s children got the swine flu vaccine a few weeks ago.  There is no difference between this vaccine and a regular flu vaccine.  The nasal sprays have a higher risk of an adverse reaction because they contain the live virus; the shots are perfectly safe.  If you have young children, it is foolish not to get them vaccinated.  </p>
<p>This flu can be particularly deadly for children and young adults.  There have been a couple of children in my small town who have already died from it.  Don&rsquo;t let the nonsense about the &#8220;dangers&#8221; of the vaccine scare you into putting your childrens&rsquo; health at risk.  The chances of catching H1N1 and dying from it are much higher than any chance of a complication from the vaccine.</p>

		<p>The last flu vaccine I received was in 1992.  I became severely ill and will never take another vaccine as long as I live.</p>
<p>My mainstream doctor, who graduated first in her class from a traditional medical school, is a strong believer in the vaccine/autism link and has warned me for years about the dangers of the vaccination program, especially for children.</p>
<p>Dr. Blaylock, newsmax.com&rsquo;s resident doctor, reports the following about vaccines:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Children are now receiving some 36 to 40 vaccines before attending school. <br>
This assaults their brains by triggering a process called immunoexcitotoxicity during the brain&rsquo;s most critical period of growth and development. <br>
Immunoexcitotoxicity can appear as learning difficulties, behavioral problems, language difficulties, or impulse-controlling difficulties.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine contains a full dose of of mercury (as thimerosal) as well as dangerous immune stimulators (called adjuvants). Virtually all neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, are triggered and <br>
worsened by chronic brain inflammation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The communist Chinese have entered the biotechnology market. They are now one of the world&rsquo;s leading manufacturers, producing 41 of the vaccines used in this country. Soon, they will manufacture the great majority of vaccines. </p>
<p>In one study, 60 percent of the vials were contaminated. One of the viruses found in the vaccines was the pestivirus, which is associated with severe brain birth defects. In addition, viral fragments (like viral DNA, RNA, and proteins) have been found in a number of vaccines.  Vaccine proponents assure us there is no danger, <br>
but the science says otherwise&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yeodqeg</p>
<p>With government-controlled health care, there will be forced vaccinations  &mdash;  with government officials holding themselves apart, as they do with most programs they mandate for the rest of us.</p>
<p>As for the H1N1 virus, this comes from the Bob Livingston letter:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Writing for the Institute of Science in Society, Professor Adrian Gibbs and Dr. Jean Downie have studied the gene sequences of the H1N1 virus and determined the virus is a combination unlike any seen in the past.</p>
<p>Furthermore, none of the genes that make up the virus have been seen for a long time. It appears to be a combination of Swine flu not seen in North America in more than a decade and Avian flu found in Europe but never in North America.</p>
<p>Gibbs and Downie posit the virus emanated either from a vaccine made specifically for pigs, accidentally from an infected human working for a drug company or intentionally released into the Mexican population&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/y8lk2o4</p>
<p>Blacks are correct for not lining up like lemmings for the flu vaccine  &mdash;  but for reasons different from those of Whites choosing to avoid the government&rsquo;s program.  Many Whites will make an informed, rational decision not to vaccinate themselves or their children.  </p>
<p>Blacks will assume Whites manufactured the vaccine to specifically give them the virus or to make them sterile or for any other nonsensical reason.  It&rsquo;s a no-win situation  &mdash;  if they get the virus, they&rsquo;ll blame Whites for withholding the vaccine from blacks, if they take the vaccine, any perceived health problem will be blamed on diabolical White plans to reduce black numbers.</p>
<p>As other have repeatedly said, there is no way to satisfy blacks  &mdash;  better to avoid them at all costs.</p>
