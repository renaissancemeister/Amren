<h1>Race Law Lacks Traction</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mandy Locke, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Judges have been turning deaf ears to defendants&rsquo; requests to delay murder cases to examine whether they face the death penalty because of their skin color.</p>
<p>Four months ago, North Carolina lawmakers passed a ground-breaking law that allows defendants to avoid a capital trial or seek relief from a death sentence because of racial bias. In recent weeks, some judges have refused to consider requests to allow time to examine the role of race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No one has been executed in North Carolina since August 2006, when legal challenges in state and federal courts halted the death penalty.</p>
<p>Despite that, prosecutors in the state have been pursuing punishment by death with as much fervor as in prior years. Of the roughly 1,200 pending first-degree murder cases, at least 250 are capital cases, according to the state Capital Defender&rsquo;s Office. Of the 25 capital trials in 2007 and 2008, juries imposed death four times. The death row population is 163.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The law&rsquo;s impact</b></p>
<p>Death penalty opponents heralded the law as a victory that could undo a system of punishment steeped in racial bias. Staunch supporters of the death penalty feared the law would circumvent a punishment delivered for centuries for the most heinous crimes. Now, four months after its passage, it&rsquo;s not clear what, if any, impact the law will have.</p>
<p>Those already sentenced to death are being allowed to file appeals based on racial bias. The law also allows defendants to raise a claim of possible racial bias before hearings in which prosecutors declare that they will seek the death penalty at trial. Lawyers also have been making the requests after those hearings, but before capital trials begin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, juries in Cumberland and Alamance counties are hearing evidence in murder cases against black men who prosecutors think should die for their crimes.</p>
<p>Johnson [Cumberland County Judge E. Lynn Johnson] and Alamance County Judge J.B. Allen refused to delay the trials so defense attorneys could examine the race issue.</p>
<p>Johnson told attorneys for Andrew McMillan to raise the issue to higher courts after trial, if the jury orders the death penalty. He said that he would not consider the claim since it was past the point at which prosecutors declared they would seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Awaiting a study</b></p>
<p>Much is in limbo while a team of professors at Michigan State University Law School completes a study examining race in capital cases in North Carolina since 1990. The study, funded by private state and national foundations, was launched after the law passed.</p>
<p>The law professors, Catherine Grosso and Barbara O&rsquo;Brien, will examine capital and non-capital murder cases. They are bearing down on non-capital cases that had at least one extenuating factor that would have allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grosso said Monday that she&rsquo;s not sure what the study will reveal. Her team will not be searching for racial bias in particular cases, but it will be looking for statistical trends within specific districts in the state.</p>
<p>The study could help defendants if it proves that the state or individual counties have been imposing the death penalty unfairly. The law requires defense lawyers to show a pattern of unfairness; the law does not require a lawyer to point to specific discrimination within a single defendant&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If anything, blacks have statistically been much less likely to receive the death penalty than whites.  Most times prosecutors don&rsquo;t even try for death even for the most horrific crimes commited by blacks for fear of &#8220;racism&#8221; charges.  This is just another example that blacks want a seperate justice system for themselves.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again, which I&rsquo;ll probably have to do every time a story like this comes out:  Whites who are convicted of first degree murder are more likely (about 2x) actually to be executed than blacks convicted of first degree murder.</p>

		<p>This is truly pathetic. Even before the 2006 moratorium on capital punishment this state could barely muster the will to execute even the vilest criminals convicted of hideous multiple murders. It&rsquo;s beyond be why our state legislators even bothered with passing a completely frivolous &ldquo;racial bias&rdquo; (&ldquo;ground breaking&rdquo; my ass) law when we de facto don&rsquo;t even have a death penalty anymore - except for the fact that both houses are thoroughly infected with political correctness. This state is run by liberal democrats. The very worst robbing, raping, murdering, unrepentant, proud of their transgressions, confessed, convicted criminals always have their candle holding fan clubs protesting and crying on the night of their scheduled execution. If justice was truly being served in North Carolina then the use of capital punishment would be carried out every single day for years just to keep up with the criminals who so richly deserve it.        </p>

		<p>I STILL think we need to give them 40 acres and a mule&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.and put up a fencee around their tribal compound and DARE them to step the line&hellip;.</p>
<p>Lets put them in a place where they can blossom with their oh-so-intellect&hellip;and show the rest of the world just how &#8216;good&rsquo; they are&hellip;..</p>
<p>6 months they would be eating eachother like they do in the mudderland&hellip;..or after raping eachother they would all have AIDS&hellip;..</p>
<p>And all of these White women that choose to serve their roach-gene&hellip;..will be thrown over the fence so they can &#8216;love&rsquo; these people all they want&hellip;..(im not evil.  I just want to give them what they want)&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Since juries (not judges) must now be the deciders of the exact sentence of death, how can any court second-guess whether the motive was race?  And, as to whether a prosecutor is racially biased in bringing a death penalty case  &mdash;  well, in Ohio, a murder must have certain elements to be considered a capital crime; these include multiple deaths, aggravating circumstances (such as torture),etc.  If all states had statutes that spell out these elements, then it would make the reasons for capital cases clearer.</p>

		<p>Given the egregious errors that government makes in all other aspects of performance, why would we trust government to murder someone, and get the right perpetrator?</p>
<p>Most of those condemned, needn&rsquo;t be killed at all. I will admit that some, like the DC Snipers are clearly guilty, and are the least likely to repent, but most of those condemned could be allowed to live and perhaps their souls could be redeemed before they died in prison.</p>
<p>We should not thirst for vengeance, but for redemption and mercy. That is what God has taught us. Turn away from those Satanic thoughts; it frustrates the Devil, every time you refuse to have those evil thoughts.</p>

		<p>To Eric and Q.D.:</p>
<p>Many years ago I recall watching liberal reporters here in NYC ask Mayor Ed Koch how he could support the &#8220;racist&#8221; death penalty.</p>
<p>Their jaws dropped when Koch correctly noted that since capital punishment was reinstated in the late 70s whites were now far more likely to be executed than blacks. </p>

		<p>All blacks EVER had to do to avoid the death penalty, and often avoid a conviction, is to stack the jury pool with blacks.  Black juries rarely impose the death penalty no matter how horrendous the crime as long as the victim wasn&rsquo;t black.  The Christian Newsome murderers for example.  Blacks do indeed rate a separate justice system for themselves.  We used to have such a system and it worked very effectively.  Then Lincoln came along&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
