<h1>Claim Targets Dress Code at Broad Ripple Nightclub</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Indianapolis Star, October 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A popular Broad Ripple [a section of Indianapolis   &mdash;  AR News ed.] nightclub says its dress code is intended to keep out guns. But the Indiana Civil Rights Commission thinks it&rsquo;s intended to keep out certain minorities.</p>
<p>A commission official contends that the dress code, which bans loose-fitting pants, baseball caps and hair picks, is discriminatory and could serve as a test case for changing dress codes at other bars and nightclubs throughout the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;The public interest in this is to see that the policies are amended to be less discriminatory,&#8221; said Indiana Civil Rights Commission Deputy Director Joshua Brewster, who brought the claims against Landsharks, 810 Broad Ripple Ave.</p>
<p>Brewster is pushing for a settlement to change the dress code. The commission said in a statement Thursday that the dress code prohibits &#8220;gang attire, loose-fitting pants, single-color T-shirts, chains worn outside of one&rsquo;s shirt and picks in one&rsquo;s hair, attire arguably more prevalent among members of particular minority populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the nightclub called the commission&rsquo;s allegations &#8220;absurd.&#8221; According to the Landsharks Web site, the dress code is intended to &#8220;maintain the integrity of our private establishment and a peaceful, fun atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our basic philosophy is our dress code is done for safety. It&rsquo;s not based on race,&#8221; said Russ Taylor, Landsharks&rsquo; VIP and events manager. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rules are designed to keep out weapons, Taylor said. Baggy clothes might be concealing a gun, he said, and a hair pick can be used as a stabbing weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never wanted to be like the other clubs where they do patdowns or have metal detectors,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;We wanted to be higher end  &mdash;  a dressing-up-and-going-out kind of club.&#8221;</p>
<p>But an expert in discrimination law said the policy is discriminatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the racialized terms that were used for some of the items that they don&rsquo;t want customers to wear, it&rsquo;s clear that it does have a more disparate impact on blacks than it does on whites,&#8221; said D. Aaron Lacey, an associate professor at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rule is designed purposely to exclude certain types of individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Landsharks regular Jason Hagemier said he is glad the club is enforcing its dress code. Last winter, the club was not quite as strict, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very thuggish. There was a lot of crazy stuff going on in the club. It just didn&rsquo;t promote a good scene,&#8221; said Hagemier, 31, who owns a hair salon in Carmel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they enforce their dress code a little bit,&#8221; said Hagemier, who is white. &#8220;Everyone&rsquo;s in there having a good time. Everyone looks nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brewster said that if Landsharks opts against a settlement, an administrative law judge or the seven-member commission could order a change in the dress code policy. The commission does not have the power to issue a fine, he said, but can enforce its rulings through the courts.</p>
<p>Brewster based his claim on employment law, but he said there are no clear legal guidelines on dress codes for bars. He recalled only one other case brought against a bar, in Indianapolis; he could not remember the name of the bar, which settled the case privately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that this is a common dress code,&#8221; Brewster said, and one reason for targeting Landsharks is &#8220;to establish a precedent.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t anybody take the truth to court?</p>
<p>Black males are by far more violent than any other ethnic group. So it makes logical sense to exclude them from places involving alcohol and potential fighting over honorific events. </p>

		<p>Gosh, even some blacks are fed up with baggy under your butt pants.  If the dress code is enforced evenly how can it be discrimination?  Disparate impact is so bogus.  What about the disparate impact of white victims of black crime?</p>

		<p>Of course this dress code is to keep blacks out, I applaud them for it.  The owners of this club know that a large number of blacks in their establishment means certain violence and increased liability.  Most clubs start out as either black or white, but white clubs have a problem as most whites have jobs and cannot be out clubbing on a random Tuesday.  Many white clubs then make the mistake of hosting &#8220;hip hop nights&#8221; on slow days to increase revenue.  Once blacks start to frequent the club regularly the atmosphere of the club changes to one where violence can erupt at any time.  After a few violent episodes the club loses it&rsquo;s white patrons and soon after it closes.  My advice for this particular club is to play country music.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But the Indiana Civil Rights Commission thinks it&rsquo;s intended to keep out certain minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>This presupposes that &#8220;certain minorities&#8221; are completely incapable of wearing different clothes. That sounds pretty racist to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;the dress code, which bans loose-fitting pants, baseball caps and hair picks, is discriminatory&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes - against people who dress poorly, but clearly this is found &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; because most of the people who CHOOSE to dress in this manner are black.</p>
<p>How long until laws against murder, rape and robbery are found &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; because most of the people who CHOOSE to commit these acts are black?</p>

<p>Ooh   &mdash;   &#8220;particular minority populations&#8221;!  They couldn&rsquo;t quite bring themselves to explicitly say that blacks are more likely to wear gang attire and wear their pants with their underwear exposed.  </p>
<p>I really enjoy cases like this where the circumstances force the civil rights group to essentially stereotype blacks in order to bring their claim.  The nightclub manager missed his chance to go on the offensive by calling them out on this, instead making the fatal mistake of claiming in so many words &#8220;not to be racist.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>    Well I will try one more time to get one in.You don&rsquo;t need<br>
  a dress code.All you need is music.Country music,Folk music,<br>
  Classical music.Or a little ethnic music such as Greek,<br>
  Italian,Russian,etc,etc.<br>
    <br>
    I know a lot of you do not like these choices,But we all have<br>
  to make sacrifices,and these choices are better than the<br>
  alternative.</p>

		<p>If a group of black men in polo shirts and dress pants are welcome, the claim has no merit.  </p>
<p>If a group of white whiggers in neckchains, oversize sports jerseys, sideways baseball caps and loose pants are denied entry, the claim has no merit.</p>
<p>Men who go out in groups &#8216;peacocking&rsquo; are usually the ones who make trouble.   </p>

		<p>I work in the nightclub industry in Canada, and the only clubs that are routinely shut down because of gangs or gunplay are the ones who cater to blacks.  Screening out the thugs means the (unarmed) security staff aren&rsquo;t having their lives put at risk. It&rsquo;s a liability issue.</p>

		<p>Here in Toronto every year on the first weekend in August we have the Caribana festival. It&rsquo;s a black themed weekend with a parade and lots of partying. People, especially blacks, come from far and wide to have fun. It&rsquo;s not a particularly violent weekend at least not more than usual for Toronto. A bar I go to gets a big crowd on that weekend. I was asking the bartender if the staff were looking forward to it because of the extra business. No, I was told, the staff hate working the weekend because of the lousy tips and bad attitudes. And yet to hear the leaders in this city, Caribana is a great example of how diversity enriches the city. </p>

<p>This racist perspective by ICRC associates gang attire with black people. I wonder if the ICRC also associates drug dealing, violent crime and low IQ with black people?</p>
<p>Such sterotyping and prejudice and prejudice has no place at ICRC.</p>

		<p>A business attire requirement. Racist?  Blue jeans and  cotton shirts, racist?  Golf type attire. Racist? Seattle attire, ie jeans and flannels. Racist? Most people don&rsquo;t dress like drive by shooters or drug dealers. </p>
<p>This Indiana Commission should be abolished as antiAmerican. That would be a step for liberty, along with abolition of the EEOC.</p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken restaurants and bars have the right to refuse service at their discretion, as long as it does not involve race. The best way to sort out the trash is club membership.</p>

		<p>I guarantee you that a reputation of a club as a solely &#8220;black&#8221; one is the kiss of death.  As an Eighties-era nightclub DJ, part of my job was to add white dance tracks to a nearly total black one.  Blacks were far better at starting fights than starting a bar tab.  I brought in some extra drink revenues before the place closed.     </p>

<p>Yeah, because they want to be an upscale club.  If there are a bunch of thugs who want to come in, they have to dress up and the chances of that happening is little to none.</p>
<p>It seems that the commissioner is making this a race thing.  Typical.  Always playing the race card.</p>
