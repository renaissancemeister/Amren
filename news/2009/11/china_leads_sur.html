<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1116/p02s13-usgn.html">China Leads Surge of Foreign Students Into US Colleges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard LaFranchi, Christian Science Monitor, November 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An all-time high of 671,616 foreign students studied in US colleges and universities in the 2008-09 academic year, according to the annual Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education (IIE). All told, those students spent nearly $18 billion across the US, according to a separate report also issued today by NAFSA, a nonprofit association promoting international education.</p>
<p>Together, the two reports paint a picture of a world of increasingly globalized education: foreigners prize an American college education more and more every year, and American students consider some amount of study abroad a requisite part of their education.</p>
<p>Among the reports&rsquo; highlights:</p>
<p>* China was largely responsible for the year&rsquo;s 8 percent growth in foreign students in the US, sending nearly one-quarter more students than last academic year  &mdash;  or about 98,000. But unlike in the past, more of those Chinese students are undergraduates  &mdash;  not graduate students  &mdash;  as wealthy Chinese families pay for the international gold standard in education for their one child.</p>
<p>* Four countries increased their number of America-bound students by 20 percent or more: China, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam. Vietnam vaulted into the Top 10 with nearly 13,000 students in the US  &mdash;  a 46 percent jump over the previous year.</p>
<p>* Americans studying abroad rose by nearly 9 percent to 262,416. But more of those students are looking outside the semester-abroad destinations of their parents  &mdash;  often in Western Europe  &mdash;  for Asian studies in China, India, and Japan. South Africa and Argentina are also drawing growing numbers of Americans.</p>
<p>The State Department is providing more Americans with scholarships to study in countries where critical languages such as Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu are spoken  &mdash;  an effort to remedy a recent dearth of foreign-service applicants with those skills.</p>
<p>The State Department is also playing a role in the effort to attract foreign students to the US. It has established a network of offices around the globe where students can research US educational opportunities. There, foreign students can get answers to questions such as the differences between large universities and the typically American small liberal-arts college.</p>

<p>That begs the question, </p>
<p><b>just how many of these Americans are actually European-American</b>?</p>

<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to the State Department that only an utter fool would go study in the places where Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu are spoken and that is why there is a &ldquo;dearth&rdquo; in applicants fluent in these languages. These countries (and I use that term rather loosely here) are all Third World toilet trenches after all, so why would any rational American want to spend a significant portion of their youth in one of them? Even most of the starry-eyed and superficial little Young Pioneers that get into college these days, aren&rsquo;t so zombified by the K through 12 diversity propaganda, that they would actually go and wallow in the real thing for three or four years of their lives.</p>
<p>After all, diversity&rsquo;s real name is sanctimony and tolerance&rsquo;s is hypocrisy! <br>

		<p>It must be remembered that all these colleges are businesses that must generate some income.  In a way, we ought to be proud that so many value an education gained in the U.S.  It will be our own fault if we fail to graduate enough Americans with the skills to keep America strong.  The problem is when the students stick around after their education, marry Americans, spy for their home country, and otherwise represent an increase of the unpatriotic population.</p>

		<p>The majority of overseas students studying here in Australia return home, but that is not the case with Indian and perhaps Chinese students. Often study is a scam to get permanent residency. I drove past the University of NSW (Sydney Australia) last week and saw a sea of Asian faces. </p>
<p>This situation is causing a lot of hostility, especially towards Indians.</p>

		<p>The more temporary international students, the better - they pay full tuition, pay for room and board, don&rsquo;t commit crime generally, and leave the country when they graduate. The only people who complain are the students, about &#8216;ruining the curve.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>You can bet that every one of them reports back weekly to the Chinese military about our weaknesses, nuclear facilities, airports, harbors, bridges, infrastructure, police response time, civil defense (or lack thereof), subway systems, water supplies, electrical grids, computer hacking potential, etc., etc. We must assume every one of them is a spy&hellip;</p>

		<p>   In my experience the African, Latin American and Indian students jump their Visas the most often. Chinese students do stay but in lesser numbers over the last few years. Japanese and Korean students normally all go home as do the Europeans.  </p>

		<p>We actually give them the competencies, often at taxpayer support, to go home and start companies to compete directly against the American businesses that remain. It&rsquo;s a form of economic suicide we call diversity. Oh yes, I almost forgot. The diversity elitists claim it makes us &#8220;stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>1. It&rsquo;s statistically unlikely that they&rsquo;re all spies. That&rsquo;s just your unchecked paranoia speaking.</p>
<p>2. Every major power has spies. All of them. Not just China.</p>
<p>3. Your assumption that all of China&rsquo;s spies are Chinese is probably false.</p>

		<p>I am a professor at a school in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Some of you may believe that all Chinese students are geniuses, and so did I until I started teaching &#8220;second echelon&#8221; type of students.  The first wave of Chinese students were their cream of the crop, and were for the most part outstanding.  The second echelon skips class, fails to do their work, etc at about the same rate as Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just thought you&rsquo;d like to know my viewpoint!</p>

		<p>On this U.S. state university, the students from PRC by all<br>
indications meeting the eye, practice a firm preference &#8220;us&#8221; to<br>
&#8220;them&#8221; and spend scant time in elective social relationships with<br>
Caucasians, whom,I&rsquo;m told, are often alluded to by the PRC students as  &#8220;long noses&#8221; or &#8220;smelly ones&#8221;.  That they mimic<br>
Americans by way of dress, pop &#8220;manners&#8221;, etc.  lends irony to<br>
their self preference.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous at 5:35, China does not send students here to strengthen us, they want to strengthen themselves.  That goes for India and Vietnam and any other country.  They would not export large numbers of smart people if they weren&rsquo;t expecting a very large return on the investment.  A certain percent will be outright spies, though the majority will not be chosen for that work.  To paraphrase Chairman Mao: The spy swims in the sea of &#8220;harmless, loyal&#8221; Asian Americans.  But particularly worrisome is the recruiting process.  Since these people have no loyalty to this country, they have no moral objection to working for the homeland, and if the methods of Chinese gangs are any clue, those selected by Chinese Intelligence will not refuse and will certainly not call the FBI.  China can simply wait and see which of its engineering students gains access to the most valuable technology and put the screws to them, no need to groom a mole for 20 years.  <br>
     As for the &#8220;harmless, loyal&#8221; Chinese Americans?  They will be an politically influential interest group, giving money to Chinese candidates anywhere in the country, and to whatever local candidates will pander the most to Chinese interests.  When Michael Woo ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, he was flying back east to Chicago and elsewhere, raising money from his Chinese brethren.  They will stick together to cheat Whites, that is certain.   That&rsquo;s how they operate all over southeast Asia.  We have enough minorities in this country who care nothing for the common good, only for their own tribal interests.  We don&rsquo;t need another.</p>

		<p>Maybe I am paranoid, but I sometimes think that students from China and India are present in large numbers in American universities because their countries of origin wants them to study Western science and technology&hellip; and someday use them against us.</p>
