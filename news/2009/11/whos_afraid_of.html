<h1>Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Michael Steele?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ellison Lodge, VDARE, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory, The GOP appointed African American Michael Steele as chairman of the Republican National Committee with the explicit purpose of trying to reach out to minorities. The party got more than it bargained for. Shortly after assuming his position, Michael Steele told the <cite>Washington Times</cite> that the party needed a &#8220;hip hop&#8221; make over:<blockquote>&#8220;&#8216;There was underlying concerns we had become too regionalized and the party needed to reach beyond our comfort&rsquo; zones, he said, citing defeats in such states as Virginia and North Carolina. &#8216;We need messengers to really capture that region  &mdash;  young, Hispanic, black, a cross section.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We want to convey that the modern-day GOP looks like the conservative party that stands on principles. But we want to apply them to urban-surburban hip-hop settings.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Steele went on to say that the Party&rsquo;s new image &#8220;will be avant garde, technically. It will come to table with things that will surprise everyone  &mdash;  off the hook.&#8221; [<cite>Steele: GOP needs &#8216;hip-hop&rsquo; makeover,</cite> by Ralph Hallow, Washington Times, February 19, 2009]</p>
<p>For those who are not avant garde, Steele used the phrase &#8220;off the hook&#8221; as hip hop slang for fresh and new, rather than the older meaning of being out of trouble.</p>
<p>The RNC&rsquo;s website, GOP.com displays this new attitude. I recently documented on TakiMag just how awful it is. Among the gems there: creating a new profile on GOP heroes  &mdash;  filled with of no-name black Reconstruction politicians; and a blog by Steele originally called &#8220;What Up&#8221; (but apparently this title became too embarrassing, and it was replaced with the less jiggy &#8220;change the game&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Steele is apparently convinced that his pandering paid off in the 2009 elections. Appearing on <cite>Washington Watch,</cite> the black oriented TV show hosted by anti-white race baiter Roland Martin, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw in Christie and you saw in McDonnell a door open [to the black community] because they went in and engaged. McDonnell was very deliberate about spending. I mean, [Black Entertainment Television founder] Sheila Johnson was on his team. I mean, that was a big deal. That&rsquo;s because he engaged her and she helped navigate him through that relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steele could have mentioned that New Jersey is also home to the self described (white) &#8220;Republican Rapper&#8221; Hi-Caliber, who busted rhymes like &#8220;I can&rsquo;t take this, these libs are phony/ And I got a bone to pick with Jon Bon Jovi/ He won&rsquo;t do a show for the troops during War Time, but he&rsquo;ll a do a show for that bum John Corzine&#8221; during the campaign.</p>
<p>So how much did winning gubernatorial candidates Bob McDonnell (VA) and Christie (NJ) victories depend on their newly opened door to the black vote?</p>
<p>Both Bob McDonnell and Chris Christie received a trivial 9% of the black vote. In 2008, John McCain received an only slightly more trivial 8% in both Virginia and New Jersey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fair assumption that this one percentage point increase among the black voters was the result of the fact that they did not have an African American Democrat to vote for  &mdash;  rather than the fact that Michael Steele is the chairman of the RNC, that the founder of BET supported the Republicans, or that they found out that Pickney Pinchback was a Republican on GOP.com.</p>
<p>Far more important were the Republican gains among white voters. Bob McDonnell received 67% of the White vote to John McCain&rsquo;s 60% and 2008 Virginia Republican Senator Jim Gilmore&rsquo;s atrocious 43%. On top of that, the white share of the vote in Virginia increased from 70% in 2008 to 78% in 2009.</p>
<p>This means that <em>had every single Black, Hispanic, and Asian Vote gone to Creigh Deeds,</em> McDonnell would have still won  &mdash;  with over 52% of the state&rsquo;s vote.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, Christie received 59% of the White vote, compared to McCain&rsquo;s 50%.</p>
<p>On a side note, New Jersey Hispanics  &mdash;  just 12% of the voters in 2009  &mdash;  gave Christie 33% of their vote, compared to 21% for McCain. This is entirely typical of the Hispanic vote fluctuating in parallel to the white vote, but further to the left. I actually am pleasantly surprised that no one (to my knowledge) is trying to attribute his success to the oh-so-vital Hispanic swing vote. [For readers who want to do their own calculations, here are the exit poll links: NJ 2009, VA 2009, NJ 2008, VA 2008 President, VA 2008 Senate.]</p>
<p>Even though Republicans chose Steele to be their chairman, he continues to assert that Republicans are not welcoming to blacks. His comments about Christie and McDonnell&rsquo;s successful pandering were prefaced by his agreeing with the outlandish assertion by <cite>Washington Watch</cite>&rsquo;s Martin that white Republicans are afraid of blacks.</p>
<p>Steele said:<blockquote>&#8220;You&rsquo;re absolutely right. I mean I&rsquo;ve been in the room and they&rsquo;ve been scared of me and I&rsquo;m like, &#8216;I&rsquo;m on your side,&rsquo; so I can imagine going out there talking to someone like you.&#8221; [<cite>Steele: White Republicans are scared of me,</cite> Jordan Fabian, The Hill, November 9, 2009]<br>
</blockquote>I can honestly say that I&rsquo;m not afraid of Michael Steele. But he is not on our side. By pandering to minorities and insulting the white base, he is destroying the Republican Party.</p>
<p>In the interest of racial justice, I should add whenever Barack Obama pushes some anti-white policy, I ask myself: &#8220;Would President Hillary Clinton or John Edwards do the same thing?&#8221; In most cases, they would.</p>
<p>Similarly, whenever Michael Steele panders, I ask: &#8220;Would Ken Mehlman or Ed Gillespie do the same thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>But while Mehlman and Gillespie went to destructive lengths in groveling to Hispanics and apologizing for the Southern Strategy, I can&rsquo;t imagine them making such buffoons of themselves as to try to make a Hip Hop makeover of the party or systematically alienating its white base.</p>
<p>In fact, even Barack Obama is wise enough not to make a comment about White Republicans being afraid of him when he walks into a room.</p>
<p>And at least the Democrats are getting votes from the minorities they pander to.</p>
<p>The GOP successfully took back the governorships in New Jersey and Virginia with the Sailer Strategy  &mdash;  but not because they knew what they were doing. If anything, the success of the Republican candidates in the November 3 election was in spite of the national GOP. Certainly NY-23&rsquo;s Doug Hoffman would have had a much better chance of winning had the GOP Establishment not initially backed, and given over a million dollars to, Dede Scozzafava  &mdash;  who went on to endorse the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Barack Obama and the Democrats&rsquo; anti-white agenda is so blatant that White Middle Americans are running back to the GOP in droves.</p>
<p>But unless the GOP gets rid of hacks like Steele, it doesn&rsquo;t deserve them.<br>

		<p>That 9% received by McDonnell and Christie in 2009 compared to the 8% that McCain got in VA and NJ last year is itself inflated.  The reason is that they count all the votes from a black parts of cities and assume that the only people voting there are black.  But there are some white people who, for whatever reason, don&rsquo;t have the money, are too old, don&rsquo;t have the desire, to move, haven&rsquo;t, and live there.  And whites who live around blacks are more likely than whites in general to vote Republican, just as pure reactionary move.</p>
<p>The black turnout in NJ and VA just wasn&rsquo;t as high as it was last year, for obvious reasons.  It will be as high again in 2012, assuming President Obama runs for a 2nd term.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because white republicans are not afraid of Obama (anymore than the normal deference and fear and distancing whites keep towards blacks - perhaps for their own safety). Whites are, however, afraid of black conservatives. Perhaps all whites are and not just conservative ones. .</p>

		<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m fed up with the GOP&rsquo;s incessant pandering to minorities.</p>
<p>John McCain was a militant supporter of amnesty for illegal aliens, alienating his own base. But Hispanics flocked to Barack Obama, voting for him 2 to 1.</p>
<p>You would think that after the GOP lost the election, even though John McCain pandered excessively to Hispanics, the party would get its head out of its rear and learn to stop isolating its core white, middle American base by pandering to minorities, which has proven to never work.</p>
<p>What did the GOP do after learning from the election that pandering to minorities doesn&rsquo;t work? They make a black man the chairman of the RNC.</p>
<p>I voted for a third party candidate in protest of the GOP&rsquo;s nominating a militant supporter of amnesty for illegal aliens. I will continue to vote third party so long as the GOP persists in its stubbornness. The GOP will not get my vote until they return to representing its base.</p>

<p>I noticed this here in my town in North Carolina too. A lot of important elections were pushed off to this years non-presidential election year. A racial plot? Who knows. I do think republicans will once again make a good showing here in North Carolina, from the looks of thing. Maybe not in 2012 but again. The media is so biased against whites and those on the right, it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed? </p>

		<p>Quiet Pro:  I&rsquo;m not afraid of Steele.  He became RNC Chairman even though he has not yet won an election for public office in his life.  He was Lieutenant Governor of MD, but that&rsquo;s not a separate elected office   &mdash;   Bob Ehrlich picked him as his running mate, then Ehrlich won the election for Governor.  (It would be like Joe Biden saying he won the election for Vice-Messiah.)  Four years later, Steele tried for U.S. Senate but lost to Ben Cardin.</p>

		<p>Steele&rsquo;s beliefs are a formula for utter catastrophe for the GOP. Not in our lifetimes (and likely far beyond) will the Republicans ever gain a foothold with aggrieved minorities.  Nor should they. Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t want what we want.  They want preferential treatment, handouts, special privileges.</p>
<p>One would have thought that the defeat of that lip-bibbling buffoon John McCain would have amply demonstrated the political folly of pandering to destructive minorities who view our nation as nothing more than a system of racial spoils for those who have contributed nothing but the Cheeches and Chongs, the Jeremiah Wrights, or the vacuous Oprahs to our national character and achievements. </p>

		<p>  I remember in 1988 here in &#8220;Sundered California&#8221; when Bush the Elder was running for President.  There was an appearance by the same in a local park. I attended the rally and was &#8220;treated&#8221; to seeing Aztec-style dancers gyrating and stomping in a pathetic attempt by the GOP to &#8220;attract&#8221; Hispanic observers/supporters!  I thought at the time how ridiculous the spectacle was! It just seems the GOP gets zanier and zanier!</p>

		<p>How strange to go from a staunch war party with a site as conservative as possible to a ghetto party with a site that looks like Ice-T would approve. They jumped from the cooking pot into the frying pan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I left the GOP and joined an independent party. After 25 years of a machine republican I finally woke up and realized how truly bankrupt they are. I put them on even keel with the Democrats. </p>
<p>American needs very smart solutions implemented with a will: not what the ghetto has to offer. Perhaps favela politics will accelerate the rise of a third party.. one that isn&rsquo;t interested in mimicking the ghetto.</p>

		<p>Something sort of hit me when I woke up this morning.  Maybe installing Michael Steele as its chairman is the RNC elites&rsquo; way of telling us that they&rsquo;re still the party of the Old Egalitarian Reprobate, Adolph Lenin.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not a matter of we don&rsquo;t want him, they won&rsquo;t want us.  I have always thought that white Southerners&rsquo; alliance with the Republican Party of Lincoln made about as much sense as the Hitler-Stalin pact, for many of the same reasons, philosophically speaking.</p>

		<p>&#8220;On top of that, the white share of the vote in Virginia increased from 70% in 2008 to 78% in 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>How did that happen?  Statistics show that only 65% of Whites ever vote in an election.  There&rsquo;s a huge untapped reservoir of White votes out there.  Perhaps 2012 will be the year that these people decide to go to the polls and vote for their racial interests, provided there is a candidate to vote for.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are still decent men who (for whatever reason) choose to affiliate themselves with the GOP.  But every single one of them should divorce themselves from the Stupid Party and either become independent or join one of the alternative parties.  As for the GOP, it doesn&rsquo;t deserve one single vote from whites.  Whites who vote GOP are like abused women who won&rsquo;t leave the men who beat them.  &#8220;But I love him!!&#8221; they keep crying - and it&rsquo;s truly pathetic.</p>
