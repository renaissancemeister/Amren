<h1>Will Minorities Get Enough out of the Economic Stimulus?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Padgett, Time, November 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Miami&rsquo;s poorer residents have long complained that the city&rsquo;s meager public-transit system makes it harder for them to get to work. So when the Obama Administration announced the $787 billion stimulus plan earlier this year, many hoped some of that money would help fund plans like an expansion of Miami&rsquo;s undersized Metrorail system  &mdash;  especially a 10-mile northern extension that would reach into predominantly African-American and other minority communities largely cut off from downtown and other employment centers. But the project, in part because it&rsquo;s not considered as shovel-ready as jobs like existing highway maintenance, isn&rsquo;t getting any of the $15 billion in stimulus aid for Florida, and has been shelved for the time being.</p>
<p>To Gihan Perera, that&rsquo;s just one example of how federal and state governments are missing a great opportunity to use the stimulus to aid the poor and minority communities hardest hit by the Great Recession. Perera, director of the nonprofit Miami Workers Center (MWC), is among a number of antipoverty activists closely examining which communities and contractors are getting stimulus dollars, and so far he says the picture doesn&rsquo;t look bright for already marginalized &#8220;low-opportunity&#8221; zones and minority-owned firms. {snip} And as of September, less than 10% of the $330 million in stimulus projects awarded directly from federal agencies to Florida-based contractors had gone to minority-owned firms, according to a study by the MWC, the Kirwan Institute at Ohio State University and the Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy (RISEP) at Miami&rsquo;s Florida International University. In all, black-owned firms received less than 2%. &#8220;The fear,&#8221; says Perera, &#8220;is that the stimulus money could instead serve to exacerbate the inequalities that existed before.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} In Illinois, President Obama&rsquo;s home state, a Chicago Public Radio investigation this fall found that less than 10% of the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s stimulus contracts had gone to &#8220;disadvantaged business enterprises,&#8221; or DBEs, even though the state says it benchmarked almost a quarter of the dollars for those minority- and women-owned firms. Less than 2% of it had gone to black-owned businesses. {snip}</p>
<p>Washington and the states have been trying to get stimulus money and projects out the door as quickly as possible, often bundling smaller projects into larger ones set to begin work immediately (so-called shovel-ready projects) for more efficiency. Consequently, they have also tended to rely on larger and therefore predominantly white-owned construction contractors (who in turn also tend to use their preferred subcontractors) over smaller minority-owned firms that often don&rsquo;t have ample equipment or personnel. Those smaller companies also have trouble finding the resources to post construction bonds (money contractors must offer up front as a guarantee that a job will be finished) on larger jobs. Serge Jean-Louis, a Haitian-American contractor and president of Nicon Engineering in Coconut Creek, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale, is struggling to land stimulus-related projects in South Florida. He says federal and state officials managing the stimulus should relax bond requirements for smaller firms and DBEs, &#8220;or we&rsquo;re going to be out of the stimulus picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Obama Administration insists that 15% of the stimulus contracts awarded so far across the country have gone to DBEs. That&rsquo;s 21‚ÅÑ2 times the share of federally funded projects that went to minority- and women-owned firms in fiscal 2008, say officials. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a top priority of the President&rsquo;s, and we&rsquo;ve worked very hard to create those opportunities,&#8221; says David Hinson, director of the Commerce Department&rsquo;s Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Powell argues, &#8220;We need to put how this is playing out under a larger magnifying glass, make it more transparent.&#8221; If not, he warns, &#8220;we&rsquo;ll have the irony of the first black President presiding over the greatest economic restructuring in decades, but it could actually end up worsening the racial disparity.&#8221; {snip}<br>

		<p>I have a question fellow Amren readers; Whenever I notice the dwindling number of athletes in the NFL or the NBA of a european decent, it&rsquo;s often justified by the talking heads that it&rsquo;s just due to natural ability. I do see that blacks make better sprinters (must be from running from lions, and more recently police and taxmen) but anyway, I admit that in some situations blacks can dominate over whites. Granted this usually applies in sports only, it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t apply to work ethic or raising children. Sorry, getting off the point.<br>
My question is- why is it acceptable to allow a disproportionate amount of one race in one type of profession (sports) based on the fact that they are better at it; when if the same type of disproportion exists in other fields (engineering, medicine, science, oh hell just about everything else) and this is so wrong by society&rsquo;s standards. If this whole grouping is based on ability only, where is the conflict? Are there racial minimums or quotas in the NBA? I think not based upon highlights on sportcenter (I refused to watch a game myself for precisely the same reason).<br>
Anyone else see yet another double standard enjoyed by minorities? I thought capitalism is the very essence of natural selection, may the best man win. Why on earth would anyone in their right mind accept lower quality just because they want a brown person to get their chance? Shut up, work harder, and earn what is yours based upon merit not skin color. Enough with the whining. I have had to struggle for everything I have and I am glad. It&rsquo;s made me a better man and gives me pride that I am able to provide for my family without having to rely on handouts or others&rsquo; pity. Be a man, grow up and contribute to this nation. Screw your skin color, that&rsquo;s no excuse.</p>

		<p>To follow up on Irish Prides&rsquo;s observation about the high number of black players in the ABA and NFL.  I submit most whites would agree that in general black players are more highly represented than whites because the way capitalism works the owners of these teams make more money when winning than losing thus it is in their best interest to hire the most talented players regardless of their color.  Likewise there can be no serious question in the same capitlist system that automobile manufacturer XYZ will hire any engineer who can design the most gas efficient engine, manage the lowest defect production line or purchase the cheapest yet most effective materials,  regardless of that persons race, religon or anything else.  The bottom line rules in a capitlist system and that alone is why blacks are at the bottom of the economic totem pole. Black professional athletes are simply a matter of the proof of the pudding being in the eating of it.</p>

<p>We all know that most minorities are useful idiots in the grand scheme of things, but never, I repeat, never will they accept responsibility and &#8220;be a man&#8221;.  Why should they when they know they can get handouts and job promotions merely based on their skin color.  Luckily, things are reaching critical mass where tax consumers are outweighing tax payers.  It won&rsquo;t be pretty, but this will be the opportunity where whites can have their own nations free of PC garbage/marxism and multiculturism.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m a huge college football fan, and I can honestly say that the sport would be just as good if not better than today if all the athletes were white.</p>

<p>I used to agree with you re blacks in professional sports.  But the evidence on Caste Football is almost entirely irrefutable that whites are heavily discriminated against in certain situations.</p>

<p>Ignorance and idiots are always in more supply than intellect and integrity. Mr. Irish Pride, you simply make the case underscoring the endemic racism and eonomic-class-disparity in America&rsquo;s social order and institutions. </p>
<p>The Anglo capitalistic model is structured for the benefit of the white robber barons that structured it. The SUSTAINED benefits of capitalism is never actualized by those who are simply a means to robber baron&rsquo;s ends&hellip; including yourself.</p>
<p>The ever increasing disparity in wealth is not only affecting blacks, but America&rsquo;s called middle class. What is good for poor struggling black folks is also good for poor struggling Irishmen. It is the OWNERS of the NBA, MLB and NFL teams that reap sustained benefit from having teams dispportionately made up of exploited players of color who are subject to injuries and longterm debilatating injuries in exchange for short term riches. Hence,the NBA, MLB and NFL are nothing more than modern day plantations, whereby the players for a short period of time are merely economic sharecroppers.</p>
<p>Take the same LaBron James with an engineering degree, or a medical degree from an Ivry League School with Board Certifications and years of experience; the statistical probability is high he would make 25% less over the course of his career as compared to his white counterpart with the same or less credentials.  The U.S. Government&rsquo;s own data shows that Blacks with PhD&rsquo;s in any field on average make 75 cents/hour for every $1.00/hour made by white males.</p>
<p>Discrimination is the first cousin of corruption. It is the corruption of the Wall Street Hustlers and Investment Bankers&hellip; people like Bernie Madoff that caused this economic melt-down. And 96% of them are white males. Federal indicments of public elected officals for bribes and kick backs more than trippled during the George Bush years. Of the 2088 elected officials at state and federal levels convicted for bribery and kick backs over the last ten years, only 35 were people of color!</p>
<p>The SYSTEM is rigged, Period. And it is rigged along distinct lines of skin color and class. We never pick the MOST qualified or the MOST capable to carry out SUSTAINED, LONGTERM requirements that will benefit the masses. Requirements that are sustained and/or longterm means the generation of considerable wealth as opposed to what Black Professional Athletes receive, short term riches for generating considerable wealth for their robber barons owners. Thus, those in power who do not want to share their power with people who do not look like them, will choose those who they are comfortable with. How many Blacks, Hispanics or Poor Irishmen own MLB, NBA or NFL Teams?</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s true, and I&rsquo;m not granting it the benefit of the doubt, then the reason is probably that most black Ph.D.s (note you said in &#8220;any field&#8221;) are in vanity fields like education and criminal justice, where getting a Ph.D. is relatively easy.  St. Louis&rsquo;s black police chief (also Montgomery County MD&rsquo;s during the beltway sniper attacks, Dr. Moose), is one Dan Isom, a Ph.D. in criminal justice.  Yet, he can barely cobble four coherent paragraphs together, hardly what you call a Sam Francis.  The reason is obvious:  His four coherent paragraphs was good enough for the dissertation board, his skin color was even more so.</p>

		<p>In professional baseball, the issue of White vs. black talent is complicated by the need to get hometown support. I am sure that there are some blacks on the pro teams just so that the cities that they represent can feel that blacks are adequately represented. </p>
