		<p>Maybe someone from the University of Minnesota can answer a burning question I have from reading this article.</p>
<p>How or why does diversity lead to excellence?  Before you answer, UofM officials, don&rsquo;t say that the reason is that diversity leads to different races and cultures   &mdash;   that is a DEFINITION of diversity, but that doesn&rsquo;t explain why or how it&rsquo;s a strength or leads to excellence.</p>

		<p>A fine collection of diverse cliches. It is hard to imagine that this is a product of a major university. I particularly liked the one about &#8220;transformed by diversity.&#8221; Like diversity is some magic ritual that will set us all free, and free us from all problems. We&rsquo;ve seen what diversity actually brings us. Crime, deteriorated neighborhoods, social and economic distress, fragmented communities, loss of national identity and pride, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for &#8220;diversity&#8221; as long as it&rsquo;s practiced there - not here. Keep your Chinatowns and Bodegas. Spare us the minarets. An ethnic restaurant here and there is okay. But keep it clean and no dog/cat hunting in the neighborhood. We like what we&rsquo;ve built. Lastly, go study in your own schools. Leave ours be.</p>

		<p>Whites in Minnesota are among the most guilty Whites in the country.  They are willingly - as are Whites elsewhere - committing racial suicide.  It is more pronounced in Minnesota simply because much of the diversity propaganda is being directed at states with a large majority White population.  They also have probably the most Blond-haired blue-eyed Whites in the country.  It is just amazing how entire populations can be conditioned like this to accept their own eventual demise.  Those of us who are awakened must communicate what we know to those of us who are more susceptible to this type of conditioning, which unfortunately includes the majority of Whites. </p>

		<p>230 uses of the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; in 18 pages? Visions of a document that reads &#8220;diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity&#8221; spring to mind. </p>
<p>Such repetition of a word calls to mind the use of a religious mantra, and that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. If this word really had any substance to it, it wouldn&rsquo;t have to be used so often.</p>

		<p>I graduated from this very school. This could very well have been written twenty years ago while I was there. It&rsquo;s the exact same empty rhetoric that was being bandied about in 1990. About the only difference is the puffed up corporate project management jargon that tries to give it an air of administrative credibility.</p>
<p>One thing I see has changed is they put all of the separate racial and sexual pressure groups under a single bureaucratic umbrella unit call the Office of Equity and Diversity. Maybe this was a deliberate effort to marginalize them by subjecting them to internal power struggles to allocate this unit&rsquo;s resources amongst themselves.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In proposing a transformational framework, we are defining diversity as not only a driving force but also a necessary condition for excellence.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The reason they use the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; 230 times is because that sort of repetition is required when attempting to brainwash either yourself or others. That is how religion is taught: the same stories over and over, the lines chanted and repeated.  Obvious impossible stories told as reality over and over until the mind can imagine or allow it might happen, at least once. </p>
<p>In the sentence example above, logic and experience tells us that diversity, that is, a group made up of people who come from differing cultures, language bases, and outlooks will conflict and require great efforts to reconcile.  Even similar groups have great difficulties getting along, like they have in Iraq and between Pakistani Muslims and Hindu Indians.  The mind can be tricked into belief if the subject is repeated often enough and conflicting information or challenges are absent or repeatedly denied, but more especially is when there are institutional and government laws to force the effort.  Diversity/Multiculturalism is being taught as a religion with the help and coersion of the state.  None of them seem to see the historical problem in forcing this on America and how it serves to expedite the fall of the U.S.</p>

		<p>Excellence from low IQ, low SAT students?  I don&rsquo;t think so. Ya wanna wreck U of Minnesota, be my guest. It&rsquo;s just a massive state funded factory school that has an increasingly dumb student body, black and white. But diversity is a measure of academic achievement?  How many Nobels have blacks won? How many doctors, engineers and research scientists will the added African Americans or Hispanics dragged into the campus produce?</p>
<p>Keep these diverse groups out of law school, sociology, education and political science and watch the numbers tumble!</p>
<p>Now if by diversity you mean Asians and Jews, you will indeed produce some doctors and scientists from these talented folk. But you don&rsquo;t need diversity/affirmative action programs for them. Just admit on the basis of their SAT and GPAs. Plenty of Dr Wangs and Weinsteins, not too many Jawans. </p>

		<p>One wonders how long this country will be on this bizarre diversity kick.</p>
<p>Human diversity is always an obstacle to be overcome where possible, not a quality to be celebrated.</p>
<p>There is, by definition, so such thing as a multi-cultural society.  There can be multi-ethnic societies, even multi-racial societies (though this is more difficult), but the notion of a multi-cultural society is a total contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>A cohesive society is a group consisting of established government, laws, and mores, in short a group made up with common and shared cultural values.</p>
<p>Bigamy, duplicity, cannibalism, animal cruelty, wanton killing of infidels, and cattle rustling are all standard cultural values in some societies. Does anybody really believe that we&rsquo;d want to import people with these values?  </p>

		<p>Thanks, Amren, for posting this.</p>
<p>Just reading the selected excerpt, I can pass on reading the whole 18 page commitment.  It tells me all I need to know.  If this is what passes for excellence in writing at the University of Minnesota, I can cross that name off the list of possible schools of higher education as the oldest starts to decide where she wants to go for college.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Transformed by diversity, our University will be looked to by institutions and organizations around the world for its unequivocal commitment to social justice; its equitable and transparent recruitment, hiring, and promotion policies and practices; its welcoming and respectful climate; its affirmation and support of the multiple identities of faculty, staff, and students; its innovative, culturally infused curricula and pedagogies; its engagement with diverse communities throughout the state; and its dedication to developing and rewarding the intellectual, creative, professional, and community achievements of its diverse faculty, students, staff, and alumni.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Oh my gosh, talk about a &#8220;run-on&#8221; sentence from hell!!!  Perhaps as part of its &#8220;culture of excellence&#8221; the U of M should require the writers of diversity pamphlets to have at least passed English 101.  Having scanned this blather it is apparent that whites, especially white males, will only exist in a historical context.<br>

		<p>And here in Sub-Sahara Africa no one is complaining about a lack of diversity, it is 99% black, In SA the white population under the age of 5 now only make up 4.7% of that population group. So in 60 years there will be 99% black here and no one will ever complain about a lack of diversity. Africa asking for more white settlers - Dream on!!!  </p>

		<p>Question Diversity Wrote&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;How or why does diversity lead to excellence? Before you answer, UofM officials, don&rsquo;t say that the reason is that diversity leads to different races and cultures  &mdash;  that is a DEFINITION of diversity, but that doesn&rsquo;t explain why or how it&rsquo;s a strength or leads to excellence.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Racial diversity is some what of a strength and makes us more competitive and the reason being that it makes the different tribes of men (especially white men) compete harder for wealth and status because the females are attracted to status and the higher the better. This drives our economy.</p>
<p>In a homogeneous society we wouldn&rsquo;t be as competitive, we would be more equal and have more of a calm society.</p>
<p>Men compete against each other for status.</p>
<p>Women are attracted to status.</p>
<p>Its that simple. Who are the most desirable women in our diverse society?</p>
<p>The only edge the white man has in maintaining his tribe of women is his economic status because according to studies I&rsquo;ve seen white women find the white man least attractive (black men the most attractive), the only time white women prefer white men in these studies are when economic status is considered.</p>
<p>Sad but that seems to be the reality.</p>

<p>OK, I shall attempt, again, to communicate the answer to our present dilemma:</p>
<p><b>Positive subliminal audio is the antidote to the negative, suicide inducing programs of television, radio, and pulpit.  It is economical in terms of purchase price and without peer in terms of results for advanced human development.  It works by triggering the will to self preservation in a way unimaginable by those who have not experienced it.</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of the population we consider our brothers and sisters are preconditioned to reject this technology, reflexively responding that it is only for kooks. When pressed for their personal experience with it they will admit that they have never, would never use it (as such might somehow scramble their fragile psyche that they worked so hard to perfect).  Besides only kooks could imagine that sounds and words could have a positive influence on the human brain&hellip;</p>
<p>And &hellip; sadly, most of the movement people are really only hobbyists who naively look forward to debating their religious beliefs somehow imagining that they can sway others to their way of seeing things.</p>
<p>The only thing that will help us is for serious people to stand against the corruption.  For many, positive subliminal audio is their tool of preference.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White males will exist only in a historical context&#8221;<br>
I wanted to talk about the College &#8220;alumni&#8221; issue I just recieved for fund raising purposes. On the back cover is a montage of students. 26 in all. 23 women and 3 men. Of the 23 women, 3 are White. Of the three men, none are White. Inside the issue the numbers are the same. Over a hundred images of a &#8220;diverse&#8221; student body, but only 6 are White males. <br>
 Now, here`s the kicker. I think the editor is sending messages of White extinction on an even deeper level here. Of the six White males 4 are  well over 65!(Alumni issue remember?) It`s almost as if what few White males are shown are those past even &#8220;retirement&#8221; age and well into senility. One of these was photgraphed from the back as not to even show his face. But his &#8220;costume&#8221; was clear. What I would call a senior citizen mall walker type. The most disturbing picture of the lot was an alumni well over ninety being assisted to the podium by a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; group of educators, who stood around and applauded as he was quoted in the article about &#8220;how grateful he was to be sharing his money with those who really needed it, instead of hoarding it himself.&#8221; The most flagant bit of self serving mantra since kids used to say &#8220;be cool&#8221; in highschool to influence peers.<br>
Of the two White males remaining one was shown with his face painted in school colors of black and red. One more White erasure cleverly concocted?!? The last image was in my mind another subliminal one. It showed two White children, ages 5 and 7 dressed up in school pep uniforms and waving their arms in excitement, surrounded by a &#8220;rainbow&#8221; of students. Cheerleaders for the new regime?!? Like the guy who wrote &#8220;Mister&#8221; said in an article on television, it`s quite amazing and scary how often and flagrant the messages become when you know what to look for and how to interpret them&hellip;</p>

<p>The &#8220;blessings of diversity&#8221; nonesense comes out of the board rooms of the most powerfull corporations in America. This is the filthy propaganda put out by the CEOs of corporations to provide cover for their psychopathic lust for $$$$$$$. </p>

		<p>Many of the populations of whites, in both America and Europe, have been steeped in leftist racial propaganda while never having exposure to significant groups of lawless minority groups.  They allow their nations and neighborhoods to be overwhelmed, and then it gradually dawns on them that they have a major problem.  In Europe, there are emerging signs of hope.  Sweden and Ireland are trying to send unwanted immigrants back, and the Swiss just dealt a blow to Moslem &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221;.  There is so much minority crime in the U.S. that it&rsquo;s getting nearly impossible for even the most leftist TV stations and publications to ignore it.  Most Americans, of course, found out about the problem long ago.  It&rsquo;s only in PC places like Minneapolis/St. Paul that certain silly twits still manage to believe in the wonders of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>If you go online and chat politics with blacks, you will find that they don&rsquo;t talk at all about MLK or diversity or equality or anything like that.</p>
<p>Those ideas are only for brainwashed liberal whites as far as I can tell, or used to throw in the face of whites when they think it will work.</p>
<p>For the most part, every politically active black I&rsquo;ve chatted with online is an extremely hateful person towwards whites. They blame us for just about everything bad on earth. And they openly talk about things ranging from taking the country from us, to exterminating whites, to breeding us out, etc.</p>

		<p>diversity will be a necessary condition. dont you see the writing on the wall? non-diversity will be criminalized, and punishable. do these liberals ever stop? it&rsquo;s time to stop them in their tracks. here&rsquo;s some suggestions. become more liberal than they are. demand that the neighborhood they live in be diverse. call them on their own hypocrisy, demand that their children marry diverse. demand that they are diverse in their social life and every aspect of their life must require diversity. basically out diversify them and apply it only to them.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with other races enrolling in school, as long as they are qualified, respectful, and they pay their own way. Sometimes that&rsquo;s the case, but often enough it&rsquo;s not.  Most whites don&rsquo;t have enough money to pay up front, and they take loans. Blacks and others should do the same, not go for free. That&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>Every school brochure I see forces diversity down everyone&rsquo;s throat. I have no problem with seeing black people, but why does there have to be a smiling black person in every photo? I often ask (in mostly white schools), do any white students attend this place? Do non-whites find this neurotic enforcement of PC diversity annoying also?</p>

		<p>The PC cultists&rsquo; abuse of language would shock even George Orwell. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is their code word anti-White propaganda.</p>
<p>I have returned to college after being laid-off and one of the graduation requirements is that I must take a class dealing with &#8220;race and ethnicity&#8221;. I invite AmReners to take a guess as to what races are praised and what race is reviled. The self-described &#8220;woman of color&#8221; (btw, why is &#8220;colored&#8221; a racist term while &#8220;person of color&#8221; is the latest PC fad term?) cannot even mention a White person without attaching a pejorative term to his description. Well, not every White, she does like Tim Wise- or at least considers him a useful idiot.</p>
<p>On the one hand it is good that these fools sequester themselves away in the halls of academia, away from sensible people, but the amount of damage they are doing to our country by teaching lies and propaganda to naive young people is inexcusable. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always amusing to watch the blatant propaganda on prime time TV.  The other night, I was watching &#8220;Brothers and Sisters&#8221; with my wife.  The writers must have learned their craft in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>One scene sticks out in my mind.  Rob Lowe&rsquo;s character is running for the Senate in California.  After a debate with his opponent, he confronts the opponent (a distinguished looking older white guy - i.e., the classic media villain) about his anti-immigration stance.  Lowe&rsquo;s character literally tells the opponent that his time has passed.  The future belongs to every brown-skinned immigrant who can get here, legally or otherwise.  I pointed out the blatant anti-white slant to my wife and asked her to imagine the subliminal effect this stuff has on the minds of its viewers.  It&rsquo;s Brainwashing 101!  She said she just watches the show as entertainment, not for its political message.  Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m still working on her.</p>
<p>By the way, in the show Rob Lowe and his wife (played by Callista Flockhart) have adopted a little black baby.  I must admit, the show is so over-the-top PC, it&rsquo;s truly entertaining! </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;In proposing a transformational framework, we are defining diversity as not only a driving force but also a necessary condition for excellence.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><i>The only edge the white man has in maintaining his tribe of women is his economic status because according to studies I&rsquo;ve seen white women find the white man least attractive (black men the most attractive), the only time white women prefer white men in these studies are when economic status is considered.</i></p>
<p>The key phrase here is &#8220;according to studies [you&rsquo;ve] read.&#8221; Perhaps some of them were written with best intentions and attempts at accuracy (though some more than likely were not), but it&rsquo;s like the story of Adam and Eve in the garden: just because it is written, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it so. </p>
<p>First off, studies can be made to bring forth any conclusion the author wants, so it is vital to know the author&rsquo;s agenda. But even the best of studies, on matters like these, can have a myopic view of the situation, and fail to take into account numerous variables. Often this happens because these variables are intangible.</p>
<p>Instead of just studies, perhaps you should look at actual rates of interracial marriage, of which I believe whites still have the lowest. There was also an interesting article here on AmRen not long ago, about data from dating websites which showed white women were least likely to respond to black men (if I recall correctly, white men responded more often to black women than I expected). Just a little more food for thought.</p>

<p>Yeah, we hear you, but blame our corrupt self-serving governments and media.  More and more people are starting to see the light, the left wingers and the government are getting VERY worried, and stooping to ever lower tactics to try and shut us up.  But, the people simply don&rsquo;t believe them anymore.  And remember, especially in the UK, we are and always have been a very tolerant people, and have never had a totalitarian governement (although the current one is making up for that).  The British people may be slow to anger, but when we eventually reach breaking point, we do it in style.  We are getting very close to that point now.  Check out some of our Nationalist websites, bnp.org, London Patriot, British Nationalist, and The Green Arrow to name a few.  </p>

		<p>18 Jason:</p>
<p>Everything you say about white men competing w/each other for the affections of white women happened before white countries took in non-whites.  I fail to see how having a 16 percent black population and 17 percent Hispanic population means that white men can have a better chance at getting with a white woman.  It&rsquo;s not as if the average American black or Afro-Caribbean Hispanic or Chicano Hispanic can really compete with white men, save in one superficial area, though as (real) studies show, that kind of thing wears out after 90 days.</p>
<p>BTW, take the &#8220;studies&#8221; you mentioned with a grain of salt.  As we know from Climategate, &#8220;studies&#8221; can have faked up data, and stooged-up peer review.</p>

The other races of the world feel that if they were in power that the world would somehow magically become a paradise.How stupid is that? Somalia? Zimbabwai? Mexico?

		<p>&#8220;don&rsquo;t say that the reason (diversity is good) is that diversity leads to different races and cultures  &mdash;  that is a DEFINITION of diversity&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe 100 years ago. Divesity is defined today by discrimination against white males. And of course, always the accompanying statement (in this case 18 pages) declaring why this is good and necessary and right - and within the 18 page reminder, an implied notion that it is whites who are discriminating, and that couldn&rsquo;t be more evil.</p>
