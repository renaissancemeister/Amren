<h1>Whitman Announces Latino Coalition Leaders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meg Whitman for Governor, November 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CUPERTINO  &mdash;  Meg Whitman, Republican candidate for Governor, today [November 17, 2009] announced the leaders of her Latino Coalition. These leaders will work with Meg to engage and empower the Latino community across the state to move California in the right direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latinos&rsquo; issues are California&rsquo;s issues: creating jobs, cutting government spending and fixing education,&#8221; Whitman said. &#8220;Our Latino Coalition is a critical component to making our campaign successful and ensuring victory on Election Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg is pledging to build A New California, and she is encouraging all of us to join her. Meg knows she cannot turn our state around by herself, and she is eager to listen to our concerns and learn about our ideas,&#8221; said former Assemblyman Robert Pacheco. &#8220;As a businessman and former member of the State Assembly, I know first-hand the value of Meg&rsquo;s experience. A candidate with proven leadership skills, a focused agenda on jobs and years of experience running large, complex organizations, Meg is just the kind of governor California needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Latino Coalition is one of 12 coalitions organized by the Whitman campaign. Meg is counting on the energy, ideas and resolve of Californians to move the state ahead. For more information on Meg&rsquo;s coalitions and how to join, go to https://www.megwhitman.com/coalitions.php.</p>

		<p>Good luck getting a group of people largely dependent on government welfare to sign up for less government spending.</p>
<p>BTW, how much more power do &#8220;Latinos&#8221; in California need?  Don&rsquo;t they own the state pretty much already?  That&rsquo;s about as redundant as teaching tolerance to the staff of the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>

		<p>She will never get my vote. I listened to her on local talk radio and she has such an arrogance about her and reminds me of Pelosi. She has her millions so what does she care about the WHITE voters in CA&hellip;I am sure she lives nowhere around these &#8220;Latinos&#8221; she is pandering to. Typical Republican who alienates their base daily, just to be &#8220;inclusive&#8221; and have that big tent that has come crashing down on their heads. They still don&rsquo;t get it.  </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s gonna lose big time as a liberal Republican.  I hope she spends a huge amount of her own money.  <br>
Demographically speaking, California is a lost cause. I would rather have a Raza &#8220;hispanic&#8221; governing than a sellout White. At least with the Raza &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in charge, some White people may get together to form some sort of opposition.</p>

		<p>I have lived in South Texas for fifteen years and have met three Hispanics who want to cut government spending, however, I think they&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>I have yet to meet an Hispanic who is not envious, jealous, and demands their share of anything that someone else has.</p>

		<p>She doesn&rsquo;t care about the Hispanics of Mexifornia.  All she wants is their votes. They are the majority and that is the only way she will get elected.  Let&rsquo;s face it people, our time is up.  I live in New Mexico and the White Man does not rule anymore. I work for a large company and they will not promote me because I am a White Man.  All of the management here are Hispanic Males.  I am living America&rsquo;s future. I am part of the White minority of my home State.  </p>

		<p>Well, another pandering politician. They don&rsquo;t even try to hide it anymore. The more Mexicans, the merrier. They either pocket the payoff, or slobber over forthcoming votes.</p>
