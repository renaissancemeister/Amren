<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1116/p02s07-usju.html">Washington Redskins Can Keep Team Name; Supreme Court Refuses Native Americans&rsquo; Suit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Warren Richey, Christian Science Monitor, November 16, 2009 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of native Americans have lost their bid to force the Washington Redskins pro football team to change its name because they consider it to be a racial slur.</p>
<p>On Monday, the US Supreme Court, in a one-line ruling, refused to take up the case. The action lets stand a decision by a federal appeals court in Washington that the native Americans had waited too long to bring their challenge to the Redskins trademark, and thus forfeited any right to sue.</p>
<p>Some analysts view the case as political correctness run amok. But for nearly 40 years, native American organizations have been working to end the use of Indian names and symbols as sports mascots in the US  &mdash;  at high schools, colleges, and among professional teams.</p>
<p>They have had significant success at the college and high school levels, persuading officials that Indian names and mascots for sports teams are derogatory and demeaning to native Americans. For example, between 1991 and 2008, 11 high schools and two colleges discontinued the use of &#8220;Redskins&#8221; as their team name. They include Miami University in Ohio and Southern Nazarene University in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Similar efforts at persuasion have been aimed at the Washington Redskins football team, dating from 1972. But the team insists that its trademark team name does not disparage native Americans. The team has invested millions of dollars to enhance and promote the trademark name on telecasts, in advertising, and on merchandise.</p>
<p>The Redskins name originated in Boston in 1933. The football team was called the Boston Braves, but the owner decided to rename the team the Boston Redskins in honor of the team&rsquo;s head coach, William &#8220;Lone Star&#8221; Dietz, who was a native American, writes lawyer Robert Raskopf in a brief filed on behalf of the team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The term &#8220;redskins&#8221; is now, and always has been, a derogatory and offensive term, according to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the National Congress of American Indians and other major native American tribes and groups.</p>

		<p>Too bad. Most of the Federal workers are Redskin fans. It would have been great to see them get a taste of the oppresive government they work for. How many of the libs in the Federal government think Redskin is perfectly OK for their team  but otherwise seek to impose multiculturalism at every level?</p>

		<p>Somehow European ethnic names and mascots have escaped the attention of our friends in the race-conscience business: Fighting Irish (a pugilistic Leprechaun no less), Vikings, Buccaneers, Cowboys, 49ers, Bills, Titans, Cavaliers, Knicks, Knights, Hoosiers, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, progressivism is nothing if not progressive; once we&rsquo;ve purged all the (non-white) ethnic names and mascots, they&rsquo;ll start in on how animal-themed teams and mascots are demeaning to our furry brothers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to guess that no professional franchise will ever give up their Indian names.  The  Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, DC Redskins, isn&rsquo;t there a Blackhawks team somewheres?  Who would admit to be a fan of a team that backed down from a few half-breeds with a lawyer?  Who would thrill to the exploits of the Yellow Bellies, the Cowering Puppies, or the Scaredy Cats?  </p>

		<p>Here is an interesting opinion on the issue of Indian logos and names:</p>
<p><a href="https://steveintheswamps.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/drop-condescending-american-indian-sports-names-and-logos/" rel="nofollow">https://steveintheswamps.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/drop-condescending-american-indian-sports-names-and-logos/</a></p>
<p>The term &#8220;Redskins&#8221; is condescending and should be dropped. But, I would support a compromise: renaming the Washington Redskins to a local indigeneous tribe. The Powhatan&rsquo;s (of Virginia) or the Delaware&rsquo;s (of Maryland, Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey). The former interacted with the Jamestown colony, a histoic event. The latter also had important relations with White settlers. This would actually promote positive relations with White Americans and American Indians-instead of dividing Whites and Reds. </p>
<p>We Whites really don&rsquo;t need the American Indians siding against us; the Hispanics are working overtime to court their support, so they can genetically absorb them and claim their land. </p>

		<p>The name of the team was in honor of William &ldquo;Lone Star&rdquo; Dietz, who was a football coach. He chose the name Redskins in honor of Dietz, Who is of the Sioux Nation. <br>
So, you have whites and Natives working together as a team. <br>
Now, you have this lawsuit. <br>

		<p>It is mind-boggling to think that this wholly frivolous suit clogged up our courts for 17 years. There would be far fewer absurd lawsuits like this were tort reform laws not being prevented by the Democrats- the party of trial lawyers.</p>
<p>BTW click on the original article and see the affirmative action mascots of the Redskins and Dallas Cowboys facing off. I got a chuckle out of it.</p>

		<p>frankbd i thought the same thing. even if it was not allowed to be a trademark, why can&rsquo;t someone still use it as a name?</p>
<p>Is a common name like John a trademark?</p>
