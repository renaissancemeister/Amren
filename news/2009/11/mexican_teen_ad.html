			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Marosi, Los Angeles Times, November 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mexican teenager pleaded guilty Friday to fatally shooting a U.S. Border Patrol agent last summer while attempting to rob him of government property in a remote area east of San Diego.</p>
<p>Christian Daniel Castro-Alvarez, 17, and an unspecified number of co-conspirators crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and lured Agent Robert W. Rosas Jr. out of his vehicle while he was on routine patrol, according to the plea agreement filed in federal court in San Diego.</p>
<p>Rosas, 30, was shot multiple times by Castro-Alvarez and one or more co-conspirators. Rosas suffered four gunshot wounds to the head and four more to his neck and torso.</p>
<p>Castro-Alvarez voluntarily surrendered in August to U.S. authorities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The other suspects remain at large, according to the FBI, the lead U.S. agency on the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Castro-Alvarez was part of a group of bandits or smugglers operating out of the nearby Mexican community of Jardines Del Rincon, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.</p>
<p>The group crossed the border intending to steal Rosas&rsquo; night-vision goggles, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the case. Rosas was killed during the ensuing struggle.</p>
<p>The assailants stole Rosas&rsquo; radio and weapon, along with his night-vision equipment.</p>

		<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano recently assured us that &#8220;The nation&rsquo;s southern border is now secure.&#8221;  We know this is true, because our government never lies to us.  </p>
<p>Although Homeland Security costs Billions and Billions of Dollars each year, at least we know they are making America Safe.  How do they make America safe?  Why, by declaring that &#8220;the border is now secure.&#8221;  See, it is as easy as that.  </p>
<p>Homeland Security has also told us that we have absolutely nothing to fear from the millions of Muslim immigrants that have recently been imported into the USA.  </p>

		<p>I wonder whether it has occurred to thugs like Castro-Alvarez that this sort of incident will simply make Border Patrol agents more willing to shoot, making it harder for them to earn money smuggling narcotics and/or illegal aliens across the border.</p>
<p>For a coyote who makes a few thousand dollars for each illegal alien he smuggles, a pair of night vision goggles is not a particularly expensive purchase.  Since the end of the Cold War, that sort of equipment has become widely available via mail-order.  They&rsquo;re certainly not the sort of expense that merits shooting a cop eight times!</p>

		<p>This reasoning, to steal the night vision goggles, sounds like baloney to me. You can buy that stuff for a relatively cheap price, and what you buy is probably as good as and maybe better than what the border patrol officers have. Those drug smugglers, coyotes, etc., have deep pockets and can afford just about whatever they want in the way of equipment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Today&rsquo;s guilty plea makes it clear that those who harm our brave men and women in uniform will be swiftly brought to justice and punished,&#8221; said Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. &#8220;I am confident that any others involved in Agent Rosas&rsquo; tragic death will also be held responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The guy gave himself up.  Nobody brought him to justice.  If he hadn&rsquo;t surrendered, more than likely they would still be looking for him, and this Napolotano is braying as if her top notch police work hunted him down.</p>
<p>How in God&rsquo;s name was this fool EVER elected as governor?  Are people in Arizona that out of touch and unaware and so easily duped?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fool that should NEVER be in a position of responsibility.  She belongs as a clerk somewhere, but only providing she keeps her opinions to herself so she won&rsquo;t advertise her stupidity.</p>

		<p>Agent Rosas was murdered by the open borders Democrats and Republican RINO&rsquo;s as sure as if they had done it themselves. They and they alone are responsible. I just read that Mexico and the U.S. have formed a closer partnership to fight drugs. NOT GOOD, NOT GOOD!! Mexico is one of the most corrupt nations on earth and forming relationships with corrupt nations, especially on your border, is an extremely STUPID THING TO DO.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Thug wanted agent&rsquo;s night-vision goggles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t the way he&rsquo;s called a &#8216;thug&rsquo; here neuter the reality of his crime a bit? I suppose if the reality were reversed it would read &#8216;racist wanted night-vision goggles&rsquo;. And the media would actually pick on the story. There would be major coverage of the mentality of someone murdering a Mexican border guard. </p>

		<p>I hate to be the one to say it but the latinos have been out of control in California since the 1920&rsquo;s directly after they poured over the border seeking refuge from the Mexican Revolutionary War. Within only a few years they had the parent gangs in place that would provide the template for generations of gangsters numbering in the hundreds of thousands (not counting a few million associates that support them) committed to a life of crime (which we pay for in every conceivable way).</p>
