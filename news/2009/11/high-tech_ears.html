<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>ShotSpotter is made by a 14-year-old eponymous company in Mountain View, Calif., that is considered a leader in the field of acoustic gunshot tracking, though there are other systems: Sentri, made by Safety Dynamics of Tucson, monitors smaller areas with cameras and microphones, and the mobile Boomerang system, made by BBN Technologies of Cambridge, Mass., is used by the military in Afghanistan and Iraq to track sniper fire.</p>
<p>The ShotSpotter system uses microphones that transmit the sound of a gunshot to a police mainframe computer seconds after the firing. The wireless sensors also gauge their distance from the noise, like bats, triangulating the information to direct the police to the shooting site. If the system sounds like Big Brother, it is, kind of  &mdash;  except, one police official insisted, it eavesdrops only on things that go bang.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ShotSpotter was deployed in Nassau County in late July, covering three square miles of an area the police refer to as &#8220;the gun corridor&#8221; in Roosevelt and Uniondale, two struggling, adjoining towns. {snip}</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about Big Brother in this case.  When shots go off in an urban area, there&rsquo;s usually a crime involved somehow   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s either the shooter has committed a crime by shooting, or someone is defending him or her self with a gun from a violent crime by someone else.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m worried about is that the evidence gathered by these devices won&rsquo;t be used like they really should.  Chicago and London have spy cameras on every corner, but they don&rsquo;t prevent those cities from having drastically high black crime rates.  What Chi and London do have are crippling civil rights laws, crippling restrictions on law enforcement, and in the case of Chicago, black jurors.  Cameras and listening devices only solve 5% of the problem, the other 95% is applying white customs and mores to blacks and other non-whites.</p>

		<p>Triangulating gunshots is racist.  It&rsquo;s a policy that has &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on blacks, which means it&rsquo;s racist against blacks.</p>
<p>Listening for gunshots is racist, too, for the same reasons.</p>

		<p>     D.C. uses this system and it seems to have been successful. In 1 case, 2 off duty cops,that I&rsquo;m sure are black, owe their asses to this system. While off duty they spotted a stolen motor bike belonging to one of the 2 cops being driven by a male. They pursued and were shot at and they returned fire killing a young teenager, I think 14. There was a big community uproar about it being a gross example of police use of excessive force. And that since no gun was found on or near the teenager it seemed that maybe the cops really were over vigilant. But shot spotter showed that the cops story was true or nearer to it than some were claiming. Even though no gun was found shot spotter showed that a shot from the area of the teenager was indeed fired first.<br>
     months later an individual in trouble with the law on something unrelated, for reasons I&rsquo;m not sure of, explained how he took the gun moments after the police shooting. Simply, that opportunity presented itself and he got a free gun.<br>
    and There have been other times in &#8220;Da Hood&#8221; part of D.C. that Shot Spotter has came thru on the plus side.  <br>

		<p>I can see a problem with such a system right off the &#8220;bat&#8221;! In certain urban areas in the U.S., especially on holidays, and especially if the holiday is on a weekend, so many gunshots from all directions more or less simultaneously that the system will be overloaded.</p>
<p>So many folks boozing it up and firing handguns off indiscriminantly that the cops will have to turn the system off, they would be unable to respond to all the &#8220;shots fired&#8221;! In a place like Tinley Park or Naperville [both IL.], this system works good? NOT so in some other places?</p>

		<p>These devices should be installed only in normal middle class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Who cares if the denizens of &#8220;de &#8216;hood&#8221; are shooting at each other?  Worst case, it&rsquo;s just an effective form of retroactive birth control.</p>

		<p>Of course the Usual Suspects will shriek &#8220;racism!&#8221; if these noise-detectors are placed in areas where they are actually needed, but they will do the same thing if they are installed everywhere, as this will have a disproportionate impact on the black and Hispanic gang-members who actually commit these shootings.</p>

		<p>Nothing racist about this. Why is it racist to point out that there is one race in our society that commits half of all violent crime and is only 13% of the population?<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious if silencers prevent this technology from detecting the gunshot.  I&rsquo;m also curious if there are other sounds that could trigger a false alarm.</p>

<p>And how&rsquo;s that working out for them?  Cameras are fine, as long as you have jurors that (1) Actually hand out guilty verdicts based on evidence, and (2) Don&rsquo;t actually believe the real world cops do it as well as it&rsquo;s done on CSI.</p>

		<p>In regard to Jewamongyou&rsquo;s speculation about silencers, I offer the following:</p>
<p>Suppressors aren&rsquo;t quite what Hollywood makes them out to be.  The tiny suppressors shown in movies would be useless, as are silencers on revolvers (the gas escaping out the forcing cone between the cylinder and the barrel would still make a nice &#8220;bang&#8221;).</p>
<p>Effective suppressors can be made, but the average street punk typically doesn&rsquo;t have the intellect or mechanical skills to pull the job off (how many of them know what &#8220;spiral diffusion&#8221; is?).  Adapting the muffler from a lawnmower engine might reduce the noise of a gunshot if adapted as a pistol silencer, but engine mufflers typically work in part by forcing exhaust gases to slow down by going around corners.  This method obviously has its limitations if the high-pressure gas you want to quiet down is accompanied by a fast-moving piece of lead.  A 2-liter soda bottle will fit on the end of some self-loading pistols, but this generally involves removing the front sight.  The large bottle also so obscures what is left of the sight picture that it makes the firearm so inaccurate that it becomes a close-range proposition no more effective than a baseball bat.  I actually tested one on the muzzle of my old Ruger .22&#8221; target pistol about 12 years ago.  Using .22&#8221; CB short (a weak &#8220;CB&#8221; load in a .22&#8221; short case), noise was reduced to approximately the level of a boy&rsquo;s air rifle, but again, accuracy was nonexistant.</p>
<p>Centerfire rifle cartridges don&rsquo;t silence well, because the supersonic &#8220;crack&#8221; caused by the bullet exceeding the sound barrier is unavoidable unless the street thug is also a handloader who can cook up some special low-velocity ammunition for himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think suppressed/moderated/silenced firearms are much of a problem in street crime, and I&rsquo;ll bet the law-enforcement officers who read or post here have never encountered one in the course of an actual investigation.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, silencers are probably a non-issue.</p>

<p>Cameras are as useful in crime-fighting as bazooms on a bull.</p>
<p>An incorporation of the Second Amendment against states and municipalities by SCOTUS in the case McDonald v. Chicago, will do wonders on the other hand.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain Baltimore has had a system like this but only in the city center. It&rsquo;s worked very well at helping the police catch criminals but it hardly deters &#8220;gun-violence.&#8221; It hasn&rsquo;t changed the fact that Baltimore, one of the original ports of this great nation, is a giant fetid slum full of hopeless illiterates*. <br>
*with the exception of Little Italy where everyone is well armed and the Blacks don&rsquo;t venture because they KNOW THIS.</p>
