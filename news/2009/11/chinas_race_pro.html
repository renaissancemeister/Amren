			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reihan Salam, Forbes, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is racism universal? Since the end of the colonial era, the rising powers of the developing world have been quick to condemn Western racism. Ethnocentrism and color prejudice can be found in virtually all human societies, going back centuries if not thousands of years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like the rich nations of the West, South Korea also has a low birthrate and, as a direct result, a rapidly aging population. This begs the question of whether South Korea should embrace large-scale immigration. Faced with a similar dilemma, West Germany signed a series of labor agreements in the 1950s and 1960s that led a large influx of guest workers. The idea was that these guest workers would come for a time and then return home. That, of course, is not how things turned out. Over 50 years since the beginning of the guest worker initiative, Germany is still struggling to deal with its growing population of ethnic outsiders. South Korea might have an even harder time.</p>
<p>{snip} A number of Koreans have expressed serious concerns about the end of the country&rsquo;s ethnic homogeneity, arguing that a larger influx of migrant workers would lead to a rise in the level of crime and social tension.</p>
<p>These anxieties have the air of self-fulfilling prophecy. Given that many if not most Koreans prize ethnic homogeneity, migrant workers will remain on the margins of society. This, in turn, will fuel alienation and resentment among this class of permanent second-class citizens. And so South Korea&rsquo;s major cities could very well see the rise of segregated ethnic slums. {snip}</p>
<p>Next to China&rsquo;s race problem, South Korea&rsquo;s pales in significance. Earlier this year, the Center for Strategic and International Studies issued a report that found that the current ratio of 16 retirees to 100 workers is set to double in the next 15 years. In absolute terms, the number of over-65s will go from 166 million to 342 million. Someone will have to care for them, and though China has relaxed its profoundly wrongheaded one-child policy, the reform has come too late to arrest rapid aging.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the political scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea van den Boer noted in their book Bare Branches, China also has tens of millions of so-called &#8220;surplus males&#8221; thanks to a strong cultural preference for male children. This means that large numbers of Chinese men will have a difficult time finding wives in the near future. {snip}</p>
<p>But like South Korea  &mdash;  and, for that matter, Japan  &mdash;  China is not terribly hospitable to ethnic outsiders, including members of non-Han minorities native to China. Observers tend to overstate the level of ethnic homogeneity in China, not least because the Han category masks tremendous cultural diversity. &#8220;Hanness&#8221; is as broad and contingent a category as &#8220;whiteness.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Frank Dik√∂tter of the University of Hong Kong argued in his brilliant 1992 book The Discourse of Race in Modern China, traditional notions about culturally inferior &#8220;barbarians&#8221; intermingled with Western forms of scientific racism to form a distinctively Chinese racial consciousness in the 20th century. The &#8220;yellows&#8221; were locked in a struggle with their equals, the &#8220;whites&#8221;  &mdash;  and both were superior to the &#8220;blacks,&#8221; &#8220;browns&#8221; and &#8220;reds.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It is thus hard to imagine China welcoming millions of hard-working Nigerians and Bangladeshis with open arms. This could change over the next couple of decades as China&rsquo;s labor shortage grows acute. I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it.</p>
<p>If China remains culturally closed, the Chinese Century will never come to pass. Instead, the United States  &mdash;  a country that has struggled with race and racism for centuries, and in the process has become more culturally open and resilient  &mdash;  will dominate this century as it did the last.<br>

In regards to the surplus of Chinese males, I hear Russia does not have enough men due to vodka, get my drift. Chinese men will take beautiful Russian wives and take over China.</p>

		<p>This immigration is already under way. While travelling in Asia back in 2007, I noticed that many janitorial workers at the big airport in Seoul were Filipinos. This was also the case in Taiwan. The Filipinos in Taiwan were working in some kind of assembly-line job. </p>

		<p>Checking on wikipedia (please don&rsquo;t scorn me for citing this source), this author is a BANGLADESHI MUSLIM!  Of course he&rsquo;s going to want rich and rapidly progressing (albeit often poor) nations to open up masses from miserable, hopeless failures like Bangladesh and Nigeria.  The Chinese and the Koreans, I predict, will be sensible and reject such a&hellip;.tempting&hellip;..offer.  If only the British/Europeans could do the same&hellip;</p>
<p>I was even reading that India&rsquo;s rapid development has attracted masses of Bangladeshi illegal immigrants escaping the failure of Bangladesh.</p>

Is &#8216;racism&rsquo; universal? I don&rsquo;t know. What I do know is that racial awareness is.</p>
<p>WHY is the world would China need to import workers? It&rsquo;s a nation with a surplus population.</p>

<p>Wanting to keep one&rsquo;s group clear and free of outsiders is a perfectly natural desire.  In fact it could be said that it is a desire that has its basis in deep rooted natural instincts and any and every effort to alter it will only meet with defeat in the long run, so these airhead types who are are mentally ill and want to merge everybody by brainwashing them will only anger most all people and result in eventual violent separation.</p>
<p>After thousands of years of failure, these multicult types just can&rsquo;t seem to get it.  </p>

<p>HA! HA! HA! Keep the faith old soul! Soon that kind of backwards religiosity view on race will crash down just as thoroughly as the communist bloc classless (race-less) idea did&hellip; This is my hope, which IS compatible with nature&hellip;. China will cultivate cultural characteristics that will make her STRONGER in every shape and form! She will thoroughly reject the effeminate and sickly Western ideas of multiculturalism and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; nonsense.  She will NOT forsake her birthright and flood the mainland with non-Han foreigners. She will rise as an ethnocentric distinctly Chinese (Han) socialist power house of potential and will embrace the idea of Empire. I mention empire because China has 10&rsquo;s of millions of her adult male population, with barely the possibility of having a female mate, at her disposal, to give towards this idea! All those bachelors should be militarized to the max! Make the idea of warfare and battle an obsession with these guys! Africa could be hers, east of the Urals could be hers, not to mention other strategic geographic areas of the globe; plus be THE greatest military power in the world! With the right leadership and vision it could be theirs! That would be one hell of a historic drama!<br>

<p>If those Nigerians and Bengadeshis are so &#8220;hard-working&#8221;, then why have they not created economic dynamos of their own countries?  Every country that has a strong work ethic is an immigration magnet, not an exporter of migrants.</p>
<p>As for America, as we all know, it has been strong in spite of racial diversity. Not because of it.</p>

		<p>Howling absurdity.  China needs to import people?  Yes, they have a relative shortage of younger people, because they are deliberately limiting population growth.  But the relative surplus of older people will begin to die off in a couple of decades, and the generations will come back into balance.  Leave it to the hyper capitalists at Forbes magazine to solve a temporary problem by creating a permanent problem, as long as the current CEO won&rsquo;t have to deal with it.  Rather than letting in a couple hundred million Africans or Moslems, the Chinese will keep the old people working for a few more years, or tax the younger people a bit more to support the retirees.  Or bring in sterilized African slaves, that&rsquo;s been done before.  Or let the old people die.  <br>
     China&rsquo;s biggest problem is supporting its billion plus people with declining resources.  Cutting its population to 500 or 700 million will ease that problem greatly, and I don&rsquo;t doubt that their rulers are cold enough to make it happen.  And I&rsquo;m certain that they&rsquo;re not dumb enough to pollute their gene pool the same way the U.S. is doing.  They&rsquo;re as smart as us WN, and can plainly see that the burden of diversity is dragging us down.  </p>

<p>What Kool-Aid is this guy drinking?  The US has completely deteriorated due to liberalism and &#8220;diversity,&#8221; as it  becomes more and more Third World.  If China opens the door to blacks they will have the same problems that every Western country dealing with blacks have, now.  BTW, the author is a so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; who worries about the safety of Muslims after their terrorist attacks (can&rsquo;t blame them all for a few bad apples), and thinks Iraq serves some kind of vital US interest.  Just another muddle-headed neoconservative liberal, I guess.  </p>

<p>Nonsense.China does not have a &#8220;labor shortage&#8221;, give me a break. They have 1 billion people!!!!! While most countries have small amounts of racial/ethnic minorities, large scale ethnic groups lead to tension and balkenization and weakening of a country while countries that are mostly ethnically homogeneous are much stronger, unified and peaceful. The USA was MUCH better off before it had mass immigration which has brought a lot of crime, welfare usage and balkenization.</p>

		<p>When it comes to immigration I think it might be best for economists to shut up. He says without immigration China needs to worry about an aging population and labor shortages. Here in Canada we&rsquo;ve had decades of tidal wave immigration and we still are told we suffer from an aging population and labor shortages. Immigration obviously isn&rsquo;t the solution assuming these are even problems.  </p>

		<p>I did a google search for the author of this article, Reihan Salam. The wikipedia page on him says that he&rsquo;s a <i>conservative.</i></p>
<p>How ironic: a &#8220;conservative&#8221; writing an article saying that China and South Korea must open its borders to Third World immigration to sustain its retirees. He then goes on to say that if these Asian countries fail to multiculturalize and disgard their people and culture, they have no hope in becomming strong nations in the 21st century. This idiot then goes on to say that the this century will continue to be an American-dominated century because of its rapidly growing diversity and transformation from a Western nation into a polygot of Third World cultures (mostly Hispanics), which will eventually become a cultural appendage of Mexico.</p>
<p>In reality, that&rsquo;s a lie. Diversity will lead to America&rsquo;s downfall, not rise.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, there were 22.5 million Hispanics living in America. Demographers predict that in the year 2042 there will be 133 million Hispanics living in America, a more than 100,000,000 increase in less than half of a century. God only knows how many Hispanics will be in America by 2100 and the subsequent centuries.</p>
<p>Statistics on Hispanics prove that this ethnic group is averse to education (an alarming percentage of them never even complete high school, and an even few number actually graduate from college), which has dismal implications for the future workforce (so many will be unskilled). The number of Hispanics born out of wedlock is 50% (so much for the &#8220;family values don&rsquo;t stop at the border&#8221; propoganda lie). Hispanics commit crime disproportionately and a lot of them are reliant on welfare. Just read <i>Hispanics: A Statistical Portrait,</i> which is available here on AmRen.</p>
<p>The conservative writer Heather MacDonald has a good article on Hispanic &#8220;family values&#8221; and the implications it has for future social stability:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/16_4_hispanic_family_values.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.city-journal.org/html/16_4_hispanic_family_values.html</a></p>
<p>She wrote another very insightful article on Hispanics here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigration_reform.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigration_reform.html</a></p>
<p>Back to what the author of the article said, that a very diverse America will sustain American prominence  &mdash;  well, that isn&rsquo;t the case, especially since Hispanics, who will become the majority by the end of this century if nothing is done to stop <i>legal</i> immigration from Latin America, will result in America having a massive underclass, which will be a cumbersome burden on the white tax-payers (assuming a large-scale, international white flight to Europe doesn&rsquo;t take place) and ultimately make America indistinguishable from corrupt, overpopulated and crime-ridden Mexico and the Third World.</p>

		<p>This article is so similar to many produced by globalists who believe that mass immigration to the more advanced nations is the key to economic success.  The author&rsquo;s idiotic proposition is to have millions of Nigerians immigrate to a nation believing that would lead to increased prosperity.

<p>And if Nigerians are so wonderful, why is Nigeria such a disaster.  Perhaps there is a correlation with the people living there???  Then why would you want them in your nation???  Pure insanity, or this this instance, hostility towards the world&rsquo;s advanced nations.</p>
<p>The Asian nations should stay just as they are, Asian.</p>

		<p>Well, I think the Chinese are given too much credit in some areas, not enough in others. But I do think I can credit the Chinese with having enough sense to keep foreigners out. This propaganda piece by Forbes was probably put out with the intention being to keep drumming the diversity mantra into the brains of whites in the US and the West, to better facilitate their destruction. Business, the elites, want to have the new Middle Class consumer population in Asia, where the people are more easily &#8220;managed&#8221; when it comes to revolt, meaning far less chance, and when it comes to being conformist, where the levels are highest. </p>

<p><i>the current ratio of 16 retirees to 100 workers is set to double in the next 15 years.</i>  The relative growth of older people is caused by medical technology and no Ponzi scheme,  whether its increased native births or mass immigration, is going to effect this balance in the long run for the simple reason that immigrants and babies get old like everyone else and you&rsquo;ll then have to import even more immigrants or make even more babies in a vain attempt to stay ahead of the curve.   </p>
<p>Support for mass immigration isn&rsquo;t economic its racial and political,  as Bill Clinton admitted when he bragged about the effects of demographic changes on American politics a few weeks ago (to the total silence of conservatives).  Numerous studies have shown the economic effect to be minimal.  Economic arguments are dishonest appeals to the greed of the victims of colonialism.  Whenever you see a conservative or other white falling for them ask him how much money does he think immigration puts in his wallet -  in other words, how much will he sell his country out for.  Even the most ardent economic supporter of immigration would have to admit the rosiest guess would be no more than a few hundred dollars, unless he is a Tyson or someone else who directly exploits immigrant labor.  The question helps to explode the pro-immigrant economic  argument among the average people.  </p>
<p><i>The &ldquo;yellows&rdquo; were locked in a struggle with their equals, the &ldquo;whites&rdquo;</i>  Not too far from right.  Another argument against the immigration &#8220;economists&#8221; is that mass immigration produces social, political and ultimately economic costs that will far outweigh even the most optimistic benefits mass-immigration is alleged to produce.   A lot of the changes we are seeing internationally,  from the guff given the U.S. by Iran and Venezuela, to the dumping of the U.S. dollar is largely  just the rest of the world reacting to the third-worldization of the U.S.  Americans, and particularly conservatives,  might pretend &#8220;they&rsquo;re just like the Irish&#8221; but the rest of the world,  with their long histories, know bettor.  They know a civilization bent on suicide and on its way out when they see one.  They&rsquo;re anticipating the changes, though they would never admit it.   </p>
<p>Finally, this story (by Reihan Salam, no less) isn&rsquo;t about China,  its a propaganda screed aimed at white businessmen to get their support or complacency for the continued colonization of the West.  The  final paragraph is the money quote in this disinformation tract,  complete with a cynical appeal to the vanity of Americans (&#8220;culturally open and resilient&#8221;). </p>

		<p>There are a lot of reasons there won&rsquo;t be a Chinese century. </p>
<p>These include a lack of innovative capacity among Chinese as the primary reason. They are capable regurgitators but very limited in original thinking. </p>
<p>Another reason is the very high level of capitalisation, up to four times that of the United States, which will lead to extreme unrest as wages and other means of wealth distribution are constrained. Most Chinese are seeing few benefits for their hard work and sacrifices. They are unlikely to support the high growth in military spending at their expense.</p>
<p>There is also a lack of transparency in Chinese accounting statistics, so that a number of commentators feel inflation is understated and growth is overstated. </p>
<p>There is also too great a reliance on export markets which will dry up as prices factor in increased wages and higher freight costs.</p>
<p>Another factor is the assumption of a constant purchasing power ration, that uses a constant ratio of about 4.25 Yuan to $1US. </p>
<p>Finally, there is the rapidly changing population pyramid, not only affected by rapid ageing, but also by lopsidedness in the sex ratio.</p>
<p>All these factors won&rsquo;t be offset by bringing in unskilled labour from the third world, who are, as we all know here, more likely to be a drain on, rather than a boon to, the economy and the social fabric. </p>

		<p>China has over 1.2 billion people.  The idea that they need to import more people is laughable.  Anybody who is paying attention knows that one of the primary concerns of the Chinese government is to provide enough jobs to keep the whole system from breaking down.  The article admits that Germany&rsquo;s imported &#8220;temporary workers&#8221; proved to be anything but temporary, and that Germany is struggling to deal with its growing numbers of ethnic outsiders.  Why should China or Korea want to import trouble?  Only white Western countries are that stupid.</p>
<p><i>The &ldquo;yellows&rdquo; were locked in a struggle with their equals, the &ldquo;whites&rdquo; &mdash; and both were superior to the &ldquo;blacks,&rdquo; &ldquo;browns&rdquo; and &ldquo;reds.&rdquo; {snip}</i></p>
<p>Call it scientific racism if you like, but it looks like the truth to me.  Africa is a useful source of minerals and some tropical crops we can&rsquo;t grow in temperate climates.  But the only real competition the West faces in the area of technology comes from the Asians.  I just hope we can keep it a friendly competition, and not Cold War II.</p>
<p><i>If China remains culturally closed, the Chinese Century will never come to pass. Instead, the United States &mdash; a country that has struggled with race and racism for centuries, and in the process has become more culturally open and resilient &mdash; will dominate this century as it did the last.</i></p>
<p>I know that this is what one must write if one writes for Forbes, but does the author really believe this, even if his name is Reihan Salam?  The reality is that this country is bankrupt, and our most bankrupt state is the must multicultural one   &mdash;   California.  Somehow importing millions of Mexican peasants, Haitian boat people, Guatemalan gang bangers, Middle Eastern Jihadists, and Somalian refugees has not made us a more prosperous, advanced nation.</p>

		<p>The Chinese are not so devoid of their racial consciousness that they would let non-Chinese, non-White immigrants in for any reason.  There is going to be a high percentage of older Chinese, but let&rsquo;s face it, even if China loses HALF of its population they&rsquo;ll still have more than DOUBLE THE POPULATION THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS RIGHT NOW.  They have so much pollution in China it&rsquo;s unreal.  They will welcome a population that isn&rsquo;t growing.  Don&rsquo;t forget also that they&rsquo;re emigrating here in record numbers.  This is another out that they&rsquo;re taking.  We may be mostly Chinese by the end of the 21st Century.  Won&rsquo;t that be wonderful?! And then they&rsquo;ll be 1.3 Billion people here in the United States! Diversity is so enriching!</p>

&ldquo;Chinese men will take beautiful Russian wives and take over China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been the trend in Vladivostok. An even greater problem is that these Chinese men stay on the Russian side. This obviously creates worries about keeping Russian territory together. At some point I think Russia won&rsquo;t stand for the threat. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt;Interesting to insert the late news on this region; Last week, the story of China cracking down on the huge, huge, corruption in Xinjiang with hundreds, thousands arrested, including those doing illegal human trafficking and other trade across into Russian Siberia.  The Chinese men moving into Siberia may actually be Uyghurs, which are of Turkic origin and a minority being pressed by dominant ethnic Chinese Hans that have been increasingly settling in Xinjiang.  Some might recall the riots there last summer.  I would like to know more about this situation.<br>

		<p>The author is conservative - thus he cannot distinguish between the various kinds of prejudice. Conservatives, nowadays, are the ones who deny race exists - not only biologically (liberals, including myself, do that) but also as a indicator or wealth or privilege.</p>
<p>Of course this is totally disingenuous - you had Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, what race he had in mind when he was reminded of Joe Six-pack, that he did not think of a white man or black man - i.e. a &#8216;raceless&rsquo; human being.</p>
<p>Conservatives are of course being dishonest - and thus this writer here does not consider white racism to be a distinctly evil phenomenon over other forms of prejudice - which it was and, unfortunately, still is.</p>
<p>Chinese prejudice towards outsiders is not founded on superiority or inferiority, or skull measurements, or ideas that &#8216;lower&rsquo; races should be exterminated or enslaved- as was white racism. Thus people are not bashed or killed on account of their race in China, unlike Russia nowadays, and even occasionally in the West.</p>
<p>Chinese prejudice is no more malign than the prejudices New Yorkers may have about Mid-Westerners or vice versa, the rivalry between the English and Germans (especially in sports), or the mutual prejudices of Anglophone and Francophone Canadians.</p>
<p>As for immigration - in controllable numbers, I don&rsquo;t think Chinese would object. There are quite a few blacks in Guangzhou now (interestingly, and beside the point I know, Obama&rsquo;s brother has made Shenzhen his home, is married to a Chinese woman and is engaged in import, export I understand). </p>
<p>Of course Chinese would not want to be overwhelmed by blacks and the character of their country altered - but that is racism. They would no more want to be flooded by Japanese or Koreans or Mongolians (obviously the reality of course, on acount of sheer numbers, it is Chinese who are more likely to flood others).</p>
<p>Just as Italy would not want the composition of its country to suddenly be French, or Britain suddenly Polish.</p>
<p>That is not racism, that is cultural preservation, and is selectivity based on place of birth, and parental roots, not racial roots per se. </p>
<p>That is why even now European countries have Jus Sanguinis policies in respect of citizenship - which is not racist, and is not accused of being racist. That is what the Chinese have also - that is the limit of their ethnocentrism.</p>
<p>The acid test is this: a black man can walk safely with a Chinese woman in China - apart from attracting a few rude stares at worst, he will be completely safe.</p>
<p>Unlike the case in the US decades passed, and parts of Eastern Europe today.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is thus hard to imagine China welcoming millions of hard-working Nigerians and Bangladeshis with open arms. This could change over the next couple of decades as China&rsquo;s labor shortage grows acute. I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>    It&rsquo;s difficult to believe that overpopulated China, with its one child policy, will need labor from Nigeria and Bangladesh.

		<p>We all need to face the fact that some ethnic groups have higher IQ&rsquo;s than others.  For instance, people in northern China, on the average, are intellectually superior to those in southern China.  Japanese and Koreans also have statistically higher IQ&rsquo;s than folks in southeast Asia.  People in northern Europe score greater than those indigenous to the Southern Hemisphere.  Skin color just happens to be darker in these climes.  People for millenia have recognized these characteristics, and it has only been in the last of the 20th Century that PC excuses have been formulated to explain differences in racial IQ.  I bought into these for many years myself until, after wondering why certain U.S. minority groups were still struggling, I started reading books about the subject.  The only way in which far-left apologists can excuse IQ differences is to ad nauseum proclaim racial bias or even the non-existence of IQ.  Even as a child I could see that Jews and Germans (U.S. largest ethnicity, BTW) seemed to contain the world&rsquo;s smartest people. Anyone doubting this should look into race and intelligence on the net or in print.</p>

		<p>I have to reflect on my own experiences with the Chinese I have known. The Chinese foriegn students (and teachers) I went to school with were very racially aware, and very prejudiced, esp. against blacks. But, also against whites and even other east Asian groups. It was more than a matter of ethnic pride with them. They were especially jealous of the USA, our lifestyle, and of Americans. As for the post by Han Power, that is the attitude I encountered. They felt, they genuinely felt, that it was China that should be and would be the center of the world,and of civilization. They were serious. And they pushed their culture, and themselves, every chance they got.  That is why I find the rise of China so disturbing and threatening.Them, multicultural? NO. Equal players in the future? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Sure, they were extremely polite,had quite the work ethic and everybody loved &#8216;em, esp. the teachers. The great grades helped them to be popular, too. But, when I dated one of them, and really got to know them, well, I got to see another side to them, one that they didn&rsquo;t reveal so readily. So, yes, I found them to be genuinely prejudiced. I thought it was worthy of note that when we were asked what our race and ethnicity was, one young woman said both were Chinese. I said to her that Chinese was a nationality, and she smiled and said that it was also her race.  Think about that a minute.</p>
<p>As for this being the Chinese century, well, none of us have a crystal ball.But, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so certain of this being the Chinese century. Surely petroleum and other resource depletion will wreck havock with any Chinese plans of being the sole superpower. This is called Peak Oil.  It is a complex topic. Do a search on this, as there isn&rsquo;t enough space to adequately discuss it in a simple post. Also, if the USA didn&rsquo;t purchase Chinese goods, they wouldn&rsquo;t be where they are today, would they? If our economy collapses, who will they export to? No other culture on this planet is as  consumerist and carefree with their spending as the USA. Is there really enough domestic Chinese demand for all the gizmos and nonsense they ship our way? I doubt it. We can all log on to various websites and answer this question for ourselves. Much of their rural population seems to be in poverty. </p>
<p>Finally, does anyone remember the rallies and protests in the USA by illegal immigrants a couple of years ago? Most media attention was on protests by Latin American immigrants. There was little discussion or presentation of the illegal Chinese immigrants who were here, and also boldly protesting in the streets! Perhaps some of the Chinese posters would like to tell us what would happen to illegal immigrants in China if they behaved so brazenly like that. Chinatown, in NYC, is growing in size and number of people. Is all that growth from legal immigration? Why is there no media coverage of this? </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;John Liu, your claims of white racism being uniquely evil is complete nonsense.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Historically the three examples of pure racism played out on a national level are Nazi Germany, Apartheid South Africa, and slavery/Jim Crow in the USA. There are abundant reasons to consider this so, not least of which is the one-drop rule in the latter, or the fanatical prohibitions on race mixing in all three examples. Those deemed racially unfit, never had the chance to assimilate or change their status, even if they wished to do so.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan was a mass murderer to be sure - but did not really pay too much attention to race - the record is clear on that - read Jack Weatherford&rsquo;s book on him.</p>
<p>The Portuguese and Spanish were also slavers - but at the time they could not have been considered racist in the most fundamental meaning of the term.</p>
<p>I will even admit that as evil as the British were towards the Chinese during the Opium War - it was not to do with race (even though of course the British had notions of cultural and racial superiority, as did the Chinese). But they did not invade China and kill Chinese because they had black hair, glabrous skin - they invaded us because they wanted our wealth. </p>
<p>And those Uighur rioters who hacked down Han Chinese, as disgusting as they were, were not really racist. They killed Han Chinese for reasons, justifiable or not, other than that to do with race.</p>
<p>And I will admit that some of the anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe is also not racist - but based on fears, sometimes justifiable, of migrant criminality and non-assimilation. That may be prejudice, but it is the behaviour that is associated with these migrant groups that causes the prejudice- not their race per say.</p>
<p>One way to understand the difference is to compare Mussolini to Hitler. Sure Mussolini would be decried as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; today, but really he was an ethnocentric and ambitious dictator. But his so called &#8216;racism&rsquo; was not really that. For the uber racist look to Hitler.</p>
<p>Rarely have people been motivated to kill, enslave, and hunt down and exterminate people, soley on phenotypical differences alone. Only North Western European whites have ever done this. </p>

<p>There were some problems in the late 1980s between Chinese and African students. The root causes of these riots was the privileged position of African students (at least in the eyes of the Chinese), who had tuition and accommodation and food and females in China - for free basically - all in the name of Third World solidarity and anti-Western imperialism. This stirred up some anger among the Chinese. </p>

<p>Its just like if all white people happened to be of one nationality - say German. Then German nationalism, by default, could be considered &#8216;white nationalism&rsquo; - in fact white nationalism would then be pointless.</p>
<p>So by purely being a Chinese nationalist, we are Chinese are being pro Yellow race, even if this is not actual intent.</p>

		<p>The author of this article is a total idiot. China, with a population at approx. 1.6 BILLION people needs immigrants for their cheap labour? Why on earth does he think so many American companies outsource to Red China anyway? </p>
<p>It seems that the Chinese &#8220;Economical Miracle&#8221; may have come with certain conditions (i.e. open up its markets to foreign investment and open its borders to open immigration(?)), as nothing comes for free. If China has made a pact with the NEW WORLD ORDER globaists then they will, as we have, suffer the consequences.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;John Liu&#8221;, who may not even be Asian, makes silly remarks merely to provoke:</p>
<p><i>Conservatives are of course being dishonest - and thus this writer here does not consider white racism to be a distinctly evil phenomenon over other forms of prejudice - which it was and, unfortunately, still is.</i></p>
<p>Chinese prejudice towards outsiders is not founded on superiority or inferiority, or skull measurements, or ideas that &lsquo;lower&rsquo; races should be exterminated or enslaved- as was white racism. Thus people are not bashed or killed on account of their race in China, unlike Russia nowadays, and even occasionally in the West.</p>
<p>It is the racism of non-whites that is distinctly evil, especially these days. Just take a look around. Nuff said. Chinese prejudice is founded purely on their belief in their superiority over all other races. Period. Same for Koreans, for example, who openly state they are the pinnacle of man&rsquo;s development. The different races have their strengths and weaknesses, that&rsquo;s the way it is. Most of it is genetic. </p>
<p>Non-whites, like the Chinese engage in violence against outsiders. Some of this is simply honest human nature, some of it is the feeling of safety in a group, some of it is purely tribal. I think whites are the least &#8216;tribal&rsquo; of all the races at the moment. But that will change as they find themselves increasingly squeezed into a corner with only one way out. Straight ahead. But yes, all groups have their attacks on outsiders. For instance, it is true that African students are attacked and brutally beaten in China merely for being African. Or in some cases for going out with Chinese women (I have to say I agree with Chinese in protecting their women) If whites are attacked by any non-white the media of course tends to ignore it or play it down, skew the story as in the case of the US Olympic Vollyball Coach&rsquo;s relatives being attacked by a Chinese man with a large knife (the coach&rsquo;s father in law was killed). The PC media sprang to life very quickly, the story changing it seemed minute by minute until it became simply and attack by a deranged individual, spur of the moment. Might be the truth, might not. Look at how the MSM covers up all the attacks on whites by non-whites. Shades of the Ft. Hood shooter.  Then it&rsquo;s down the memory hole. As far as tribal goes, I can remember being in Jr. High and some &#8220;older&#8221; members of the Wah Chings (they were probably 18 - 20) showing up to go after some Mexican from the Echo Park street gang, and then the Wah Chings ended up on the run because all of a sudden all the Mexicans banded together (the school was 65% Hispanic at the time. (The Chinese gangsters made the mistake of showing up during the morning break when every kid in school was on the yards, having a snack) Strictly tribal, as some of the Mexicans were from different gangs. They were younger, but numerous. The beef was strictly racial it turned out. Even though I was 12 at the time, I can remember noticing how the different races all kept to themselves for the most part, backed each other with violence, except for most of the whites, who were as they say now, atomized. I was actually hanging around with some Mexican kids, the type with a lot of Euro blood who tended to act more white. We see less and less and less of them as the flood of Mestizos and Indians from South of the border erupted. These kids still had some of the tribal instincts but weren&rsquo;t into gangs, weren&rsquo;t inherently mean like most of the other Mexican and Black kids were. The Asians kids usually grouped together but for the most part were friendly with the white kids. They were of course very studious like the few Jewish kids, who tended to be targets of the Mexicans simply because most of them were bookish. The Mexicans would pick on studious whites or Asians calling  them &#8220;professor&#8221;. Always picking on them at least two on one, never one on one. The Asian kids still had the tribal fire and would band together and fight. I have to laugh at some people who think Asians won&rsquo;t start duking it out. They just take longer to get going, like a lot of whites, because they&rsquo;re busy considering all the ramifications of their actions, unlike Mexicans or Blacks. </p>
<p>You have to wonder why Amren allows the statements of some of these clowns on the site. It could be to simply show the rampant stupidity and lack of real-life logic that dominates the followers, leaders and &#8220;theorists&#8221; of the left. But we get enough of that garbage in the MSM. What leftists do is the &#8220;hit and run&#8221;. They make false statements, but present them in a way as if they&rsquo;re factual. Then they bail, hoping that their statement will stick in a reader&rsquo;s mind as fact or make an impression that will cause the reader to doubt the goals or intent of a particular pro-white or to-the-right site. It&rsquo;s tiresome, but the flip side is that this tactic is having less and less effect, even on Joe Sixpack. The cognitive dissonance is becoming too much for people to ignore. Good. </p>
<p>The Chinese will never let their country be overrun by a bunch of low IQ intruders. Not intentionally. They see what&rsquo;s going on the West. So does the rest of the world. The only people who don&rsquo;t see it are a huge majority of the white population. That built in trust we have has been used against us. That trait was good back in the Ice Age perhaps, but not now. I think the other Ice Peoples, the Asians, the NE Asians, will keep their backyards clean. They&rsquo;re not stupid. </p>

<p>Right, but not exsactly so. Regardless of period, the Chinese have always described themselves an &#8220;Celestials&#8221;. Half way between heaven and earth, all others inferior.</p>
<p>&#8220;If China remains culturally closed, the Chinese Century will never come to pass. Instead, the United States &mdash; a country that has struggled with race and racism for centuries, and in the process has become more culturally open and resilient &mdash; will dominate this century as it did the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forbes has mentioned this before. China has had outstanding growth for decades, but they had no where to go but up to begin with. Are going to hit a road block at some time soon and stagnate. Forbes may be right on the money. But then Forbes is right on the money, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p>&#8220;There is also a lack of transparency in Chinese accounting statistics, so that a number of commentators feel inflation is understated and growth is overstated.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what country you live in Greg but the US&rsquo; financial system isn&rsquo;t exactly transparent.  Do you know has or hasn&rsquo;t received TARP money?  Well neither does the Fed either:</p>

<p>&#8220;Another reason is the very high level of capitalisation, up to four times that of the United States, which will lead to extreme unrest as wages and other means of wealth distribution are constrained. Most Chinese are seeing few benefits for their hard work and sacrifices. They are unlikely to support the high growth in military spending at their expense &#8220;</p>

		<p>Yellow Man:</p>
<p>Your stat that the average Chinese household income has tripled since 1990 is deceptive.  It&rsquo;s easy to grow at a really fast rate when you didn&rsquo;t have much to begin with.</p>
<p>To show you sort of a hyperbolic example, imagine your yearly income is $1.  Next year, you make $3.  This means your yearly income tripled (i.e. increased 300%) in a year.  But the fact remains that you still only made 3 bucks this year, barely enough to buy a gallon of gas.   Meanwhile, another person made $1 billion last year, and $1.05 billion this year.  His income only rose 5%, but he made $50 million *more* this year than last year, and still has $2.05 billion aggregate over the two years.</p>
<p>China is closer to the first person, and the U.S. is closer to the second example.  But not the same, like I said, I was engaging in deliberate hyperbole to make a point.</p>

		<p>China had multiculturalism in 500 and the 1300s&hellip; Ran Min and the Manchus decided to exterminate all of the non-East Asian invaders and the Muslims respectively, killing 90% of their populations outright and then chasing the remaining few thousands of miles out of the modern borders of the PRC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sheer ignorance to say that China has no experience with multiculturalism- the Han group is already multicultural. The reason why they find the Western idea of multiculturalism repugnant is because they&rsquo;ve already experienced it for several hundred years, and it ended with the complete and total extermination of most of the invaders.</p>

		<p>John Liu, look at the Chinese news. There was a recent story of Chinese attacking African students. And Chinese police cracking down on Nigerian immigrants in Ghangzhou. The stories are remarkably similar to stories in Russia. I also saw an interview with Mongolian skinheads wearing swastika tshirts, as strange as that seems. This is all on the Internet by the way, so you can find them yourself if you are so curious. Race hatred is not something that white people have a monopoly on. </p>

		<p>AmRen manages to find plenty of ridiculous articles but I think this one deserves a special prize. As has been mentioned, China needs to grow at seemingly impossible rates just to provide enough jobs for its people and ward off social unrest. Outside of her coastal provinces, China is POOR. I mean dirt landless poor. There is a shortage of arable land and fresh water as it is. What on earth is the author of this article thinking? Where are the &#8220;hardworking&#8221; Nigerians going to live? <br>
The United States is a rich largely empty country (look at a population density map) that has the agricultural capacity to feed the world and STILL immigration causes trouble here. We barely understand what scarcity means; scarcity and famine are central to the Chinese character. There is no way in hell they will have a net inflow of immigrants anytime soon. <br>
As far as the comments made by a troll who will remain nameless, the Japanese proved that non-Europeans can be just as &#8220;racist.&#8221; They believed that they were descended from the Sun God and everyone else are mindless half-animals. The Japanese treatment of China and Korea during colonization shows this mentality. Why should we think the Chinese have a different view? We translate the Chinese name for their realm as &#8220;middle kingdom&#8221; but a more accurate translation would be &#8220;central kingdom,&#8221; as in the center of the world or the center of the relevant civilized world.<br>
With that said I would like to say that the Japanese are by far among the finest expressions of humanity and my admiration for them escapes my ability to express in words. The notion that &#8220;our&#8221; tribe is descended from the divine and all others are barbarians in not unique to the Japanese and is found in nearly all civilizations. The Romans traced their lineage back to the Gods as did the various central American civilizations. Pretty much everyone&rsquo;s founding myth involves divine creation.  </p>

		<p>I was listening to NPR and they were interviewing some white whor- err woman who was part of some &#8220;sex and the city in Beijing&#8221; tv series. She talked about the nightlife and commented that while she, being a white woman, could be seen with Chinese men and this was viewed as benign or even praiseworthy, White men seen with Chinese women were hounded and attacked in bars. Because the Chinese aren&rsquo;t violent animals, these incidents are probably not very common but it shows that the Chinese share the near universal cultural trait of wanting to protect one&rsquo;s women while showing indifference towards one&rsquo;s men spreading their seed beyond the tribe. </p>

The fact is that the Chinese are an extremely race-conscious people and have no qualms about labelling other races as &#8216;inferior&rsquo;.This is particularly the case in those south-eastern Asian nations in which large numbers of Chinese have emigrated.You see Chinese are more or less openly contemptuous of the Malay races of south-east Asia such as the Fillipinos, Indonesians and Malaysians.<br>

Which is why I often find the sympathetic attitudes on this site to the Chinese a bit worrying. I also agree that Han Power&rsquo;s views are quite indicative of the sentiment held by a great number of Chinese.

<p>Concerning slavery, European colonists also had indentured servants from Europe. They were basically enslaved, although could look forward to a day when they would be free men and women. Also, some of the native American Indian tribes had  African slaves. </p>

		<p>Another thing to consider in China&rsquo;s rapid economic rise is the value of its currency. Is it being artificially kept at a lower value? Isn&rsquo;t that why so much is manufactured there, due to the low cost of labor and fewer environmental concerns? How is that playing fair? If those conditions were to change, then the economic miracle would surely slow down.</p>

<p>John Neill - I have not read of recent attacks on African students, but I would be interested for you to provide the link.<br>
As for Chinese police cracking down on Nigerian immigrants - that was a completely legitimate crackdown on overstayers. One of the Nigerians chose to jump off a balcony when chased by police and injure himself - he was taken to hospital and survived. There was a small riot in protest.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The stories are remarkably similar to stories in Russia.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That is wrong - and reports abound to proving this statement wrong, blacks are living in a virtual state of siege in Russia - and dare not venture out by themselves, only in groups. Russia has the largest, most violent skinhead organizations in the world - their activities have even been reported on this site before. </p>
<p>Blacks, may suffer occasional rudeness in China, but rare fear for their physical safety, at least anymore than they would in the West. </p>
