			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristi Gray, Washington Examiner, November 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The jury in the Anne Pressly case spared Curtis Lavelle Vance from a death sentence and sentenced him to life without parole. The jury began deliberations shortly before 6:00 pm Thursday and returned the verdict at 8:40 pm.</p>
<p>The jury found mitigating circumstances in Vance&rsquo;s childhood that led them to conclude the death penalty was not warranted. None of the jury members found that brain damage was a mitigating circumstance. The jury considered the cruelty in the crime and a previous violent crime as aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>Vance&rsquo;s DNA led him to also be charged in the rape of Marianna, Arkansas schoolteacher. Vance was convicted Wednesday of killing Little Rock KATV anchorwoman Pressly. {snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;The jury found mitigating circumstances in Vance&rsquo;s childhood that led them to conclude the death penalty was not warranted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We placed our faith and trust in these twelve jurors, and tonight they have come back with a sentence   &mdash;   a sentence which they believe, and we share with them, was the harshest possible sentence for this gentleman going forward. He will now spend the rest of his natural life in a 6-by-9 cell with nothing to think about but what he has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, our totally dysfunctional society - including those who are primarily victimized - gets it backwards. Elements of circumstance, including those of childhood, that should weigh in favor of imposing harsher penalties are seen as &#8220;mitigating factors&#8221; that result in lesser punishments being meted out. </p>
<p>When this &#8220;gentleman&#8221; arrives in prison one can only imagine all the well deserved high-fives this violent creep will receive from his fellow &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>One might wonder how different the outcome would have been were Vance a White man and Pressly a &#8220;Black&#8221;. </p>

<p>The media incessantly and deliberately uses the word &#8220;killed&#8221; rather than &#8220;murdered&#8221; when describing a &#8220;murder&#8221;.  If one accidentally runs over and kills someone while backing out of their driveway it is a killing.  If one deliberately runs over someone with their vehicle it is a murder.  The media knows the difference and omits the use of the word murder in order to pander to murderers by not calling them murders&hellip;   <br>

		<p>Well, now, isn&rsquo;t that special. The taxpayers of Arkansas can now pay for feeding and housing this man for the next several decades.</p>
<p>There was another case in Arkansas a few years back where a black felon was spared the death penalty. He promptly escaped from the unit where he was sent to serve a life sentence and managed to kill two more people over the next 24 hours before finally being apprehended and returned for what I hope was a death sentence.</p>

		<p>Nice even if unfortunate timing on this story.  I had a day off from work today, so I get to spend a long weekend back in St. Louis (I work in Carbondale, Illinois, just in case you wonder.)  As today was the first non-holiday weekday I&rsquo;ve spent back in STL since I moved to Carbondale this past January, I was able to scan the local talk radio dial.</p>
<p>And what do I find?  A black sports anchor for KTVI-2, the Fox affil in STL, has a talk radio show on a black sports talk station, and he praises militant extremist callers.</p>
<p>Much more (warning   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t have the same language inhibitions that I have when posting here at AR):</p>

		<p>I am outraged but not surprised. I do not know the racial makeup of the jury, but here in Atlanta, a majority-black jury spared courthouse multi-killer Brian Nichols the death penalty last Dec. Imagine the hue and cry in both cases if a white had killed blacks! Nichols killed a black and 3 whites and harmed or terrorized other people of various races. If he had killed only whites, he&rsquo;d have been acquitted, and he committed some of these crimes with witnesses present. He went on this rampage to protest a &#8220;racist&#8221; judicial system, yet he has been treated more than fairly. He even admitted the judge he killed was fair to him.</p>

		<p>Mitigating circumstances? A bad childhood? Is that now a license for every adult black man to behave badly? This is perverse, and NO justice for that white woman beaten to death. If the races were reversed, the Sharpton-Jackson Kumkbaya Machine would have set up marches, protests, etc. to make sure he got the chair.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time to get rid of the &#8220;bad childhood&#8221; as an excuse for not using the death penalty.  First, look at the fact that about 80% of blacks are born out of wedlock anyway.  If they place so little value on having children, why shoud we care about their kids, either.  Secondly, many of us, including this author did not have great childhoods.  But as the saying goes, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t<br>
control what happened to you as a child, but you can control what happens to you as an adult.&#8221;</p>

		<p>HATE CRIME?  Of course not.   The victim was white;  she must have somehow deserved it.  Were all the horrific sexual acts just a poor black males way of expressing his painful past?  Prison to a guy like this is the same as sending a white guy to Hawaii for committing a crime.  HATE is written all over this horrific act.. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be so sure he will get what is due him Gayle. A death sentence in many states (maybe all) brings an automatic appeal at which point SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;his sentence will be commuted to life and he will be back on the bricks in 8 years.

		<p>I heard the tail end of an interview with one of the jurors who said, &#8220;Some jurors were reluctant to vote for the death penalty from the start and couldn&rsquo;t be persuaded,&#8221; on the Dave Elwick show.</p>
<p>http://www.arktimes.com/blogs/arkansasblog/2009/11/vance_jury_favored_death.aspx</p>
<p>Stay tuned and I&rsquo;ll bet you will find that it was the three (or four) black jurors who REFUSED to vote for the death penalty so that ne can live out his life among his brethren.</p>
<p>BTW, Tim Wise &#8220;spoke&#8221; at Philander Smith College in Little Rock on November 10th, sounding like a black preacher, decrying &#8220;personal responsibility&#8221; and saying, &#8220;Barack Obama can&rsquo;t say what needs to be said, so we have to say it for him.&#8221; He movements were so rehearsed and race hustling was obvious. Of particular interest to me was his story that his 6 year old daughter, now 8, told his 4 year old daughter, now 6, that &#8220;God can&rsquo;t be white.&#8221; Now if one of the most strident &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; in the country can&rsquo;t obviate &#8220;racism&#8221; from his six year old daughter, isn&rsquo;t it possible that racism might be attributed to a little more than just social learning?</p>

		<p>If I had such a troubled childhood, I would want to be as far away from crime, murdering and skid row as I possibly could.  Then again, that&rsquo;s just ole bigoted lil&rsquo; me, with my developed frontal lobe and all.</p>
<p>AlexInAR:  One possibility is that the black jurors made subtle and intimidatory threats to the white jurors to push them away from voting for capital punishment.  The threats could have been something along the lines of (1) Have their boyfriends/husbands/sons etc. come and hunt them down, or (2) Tell the judge that the white jurors uttered racial slurs, in order to get the judge to declare a mistrial on the whole trial.  It happens in STL all the time.</p>

		<p>I fully agree this nonsense about a bad childhood giving one mitigation.  I attended Jr Hi with a boy whose sister was strung out on heroin, the father seldom around, and the mother a whore.  Yet, somehow, this boy managed to earn straight A grades in a time when grade inflation was not known, and affirmative action and preference grades were not even imagined. (the boy was of Mexican parentage).</p>
<p>I knew others from crummy home situations who did just fine, and did not go around raping and killing.  Then again, I knew virtually no blacks back then.</p>

<p>When asked if he was disappointed Vance did not receive the death penalty, Cannady said no.</p>
<p>What is so harsh about a black criminal getting to hang out with his friends, 3 meals per day and a place to sleep, free medical care and the opportunity to prey upon white inmates ad infinitum? I just sat here amazed at sheep mentality that permeates our people. Our compassion is truly our undoing.</p>

		<p>So why are readers here upset about this? Think about it, this is the kind of &#8220;justice&#8221; that members of the &#8220;Main Stream Media&#8221; have been applauding for the past 6 or so decades. This woman was a member of that MSM, and though I personally do not believe that any human being should meet with the kind of end that she met at the hands of this black thug, still, the brand of &#8220;justice&#8221; that she (posthumously) and her family received is the kind that she, as a modern &#8220;anchorwoman&#8221; working for the MSM would have lauded as being &#8220;civilized&#8221; and &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for today&rsquo;s enlightened society. As a liberal (what &#8220;conservative&#8221; anchor persons does anyone know of? Is there such a thing?) she no doubt would not have wanted the death penalty for any murderer (even her own, presumably), so why feel outraged at the life sentence that they gave Vance? After all, our modern, no-death penalty society is what the newsroom prostitutes have been working for (along with their political enablers) for the past 60 or so years. But then again, perhaps they never pictured themselves as being victims of the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; that they have created, and the anti-social criminals that they have unleashed upon the world. As we can see from this incident, those monsters will eventually come calling at their doors, too.</p>

		<p>In fact it was three black jurors who dug their heals in on the sentencing phase and refused to relent.  Of course most blacks will be silent on these crimes.  I really think they approve for the most part.  You should see some of the comments on message board made about Channon Christian.  Blacks silently support this type of thing against whites.</p>

		<p>Check out this link about one Joe Sullivan ( NO. He&rsquo;s not a son of Hibernia). He at 13 and his peeps, burglarized a home and raped and sodomized a 73 year old woman. He got life back in 1987. There is no crime that these primitives are above committing!!!! Now the bleeding hearts have come out of the woodwork like cockroaches.</p>

		<p>I agree with dealth penalty analysis.  The last time they executed anybody here in Tennessee, it was a guy that had been sitting on death row for 35 years.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time we build a max security prison in Antartica and move all the really hardened murdering raping inmates, give them a jumpsuit and nothing else.  Wouldn&rsquo;t need razor wire, where would they go and even if they tried to escape, how far would they get.  Of course, the only hardened murdering rapists would be the white guys.</p>

<p>Indeed!  That&rsquo;s remarkable perception.  I suggest that he will also take up weight-lifting, hit the books and become a legal expert, as well as a religious fanatic.  When he gets out he will be physically and mentally hardened,  more mature,  more hate-filled, and a much worse threat to society than he is right now   &mdash;   (when he&rsquo;s just a simple, confused murderer, without his priorities organized).</p>

		<p>When blacks viciously murder whites, the media AND &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; personnel are incredibly quick to look for a stolen dollar (in this case laptops) as the motive. &#8220;Whew!&#8221; they exclaim, now we don&rsquo;t have to entertain the thought that Anne Pressly was MFBW (Murdered For Being White). &#8220;She was killed for a few dollars&#8221;, the tired old refrain goes. Yeah right! She is in fact one of thousands in our lifetime that was murdered by a BLACK after or during an insignificant robbery BECAUSE she was WHITE. Someone should tell these Einsteins that EVIL has the potential to steal, rape, AND murder all at once. But don&rsquo;t ever let it out of the bag that WHITES could possibly be murdered for the color of their skin. Shushhhhhh</p>

		<p>To Gayle (re Post # 23):</p>
<p>Gayle, I nearly flipped when I read your post. I have thought of the same thing, that a huge prison be built in the Antarctic interior, in territory claimed by the United States.</p>
<p>Prisoners would be on lockdown for 23 hours. There would be no exterior courtyards or exercise pens, of course. No tracking dogs or barbed wire.</p>
<p>I disagree on who should be sent there. I think most of the hardened criminals would be Bantu, not Caucasian. Could you imagine Bantu criminals surrounded by all that whiteness (of the Sourth Pole)?</p>
<p>After all, isn&rsquo;t that what they wanted? </p>
