<p>BastaDobbs.com Announces Victory: Lou Dobbs to Leave CNN</p>
<p>NEW YORK  &mdash;  Responding to the news Wednesday that Lou Dobbs will leave his post as a longtime anchor on CNN, the leaders of BastaDobbs.com  &mdash;  a national Latino-led coalition that had been advocating for his ouster  &mdash;  released the following statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our contention all along was that Lou Dobbs  &mdash;  who has a long record of spreading lies and conspiracy theories about immigrants and Latinos  &mdash;  does not belong on the &#8216;Most Trusted Name in News,&rsquo;&#8221; said Roberto Lovato, co-founder of Presente.org, a national online advocacy organization coordinating the BastaDobbs.com campaign in conjunction with more than 40 local and regional Latino organizations from across the country. &#8220;We are thrilled that Dobbs no longer has this legitimate platform from which to incite fear and hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BastaDobbs.com campaign launched in mid-September, and included online petitions, a viral YouTube video, text-message campaign, radio PSAs and a series of events in 18 cities  &mdash;  organized in conjunction with the CNN special Latino in America. The message to CNN was that courting Latino viewers while keeping Dobbs on the network would not win them favor with the fastest-growing demographic in the country. Since then, more than 100,000 people have joined the effort. The events and the campaign garnered significant press coverage in both Spanish-language and mainstream media.</p>
<p>Lovato said the BastaDobbs.com victory marks a key turning point for the Latino community, as it moved from marching in the streets in 2006 to mounting a successful, high-tech campaign against one of the biggest and strongest media voices against common-sense immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community is newly empowered and energized, and we are ready to fight for a respectful and civil media discourse when it comes to immigration coverage on mainstream news,&#8221; Lovato said. &#8220;This is only the beginning of a much longer-term effort.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Other Groups Taking Credit for Lou Dobb&rsquo;s Resignation from CNN</h2>

Contact: Antonio Gonzalez, 323-222-2217</p>
<p>I hail Lou Dobbs resignation from CNN. I also congratulate Presente.org and all their allies for their audacious leadership in holding &#8220;Goliath CNN&#8221; accountable for their hypocritical behavior in enabling openly bigoted Lou Dobbs over the years.</p>
<p>The resignation of Mr. Dobbs should serve as a warning to all those that promote racism, racial profiling and bigotry against immigrants and Latinos with impunity. Dobbs resignation heralds the beginning of the end of the current era of anti-immigrant policies, practices, and laws.</p>
<p>Indeed, now more than ever, we must redouble our efforts to prod Washington, DC to enact laws that legalize the undocumented and end polices like Homeland Security&rsquo;s 287G program that foment racial profiling of people &#8220;that look like immigrants&#8221;, namely people of color.</p>
<p>Just as Presente.org led the way in holding Lou Dobbs accountable, Latino leadership and their allies must now hold Congress and the White House to their promises to enact just and humane policies for immigrants.</p>

Subject: An end to Dobbs&rsquo; propaganda<br>
To: __________________________<br>
Nov. 12, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Last night, CNN anchor Lou Dobbs announced his departure from the network. As you know, we&rsquo;ve been highly critical of Dobbs because he has used his platform to spread myths and propaganda  &mdash;  poisoning the debate over immigration reform and inciting fear and hate against Latinos.</p>
<p>The SPLC was one of the first groups to bring public attention to Dobbs&rsquo; use of false information provided by racist hate groups.</p>
<p>With your support, we exposed his wildly inaccurate reporting about immigrants  &mdash;  such as his insistence that immigrants had brought thousands of new cases of leprosy to the United States during a recent three-year period. And we condemned his reliance on the Federation for American Immigration Reform as an authority on immigration issues. This is an organization we have named a hate group with longtime ties to white supremacists.</p>
<p>This past July, we called on CNN executives to fire Dobbs_after he relentlessly promoted the racist and utterly baseless idea that President Obama is not a native-born American citizen. Soon thereafter, a number of other organizations joined our call.</p>
<p>Immigration reform is an important and complex issue, one that should be debated honestly. We hope that Dobbs&rsquo; resignation sends a message to other commentators that the airwaves shouldn&rsquo;t be used to vent extremist rhetoric and fan the flames of hate. Doing so has serious and sometimes violent consequences, as illustrated by the rise in hate crimes against Latinos and the unprecedented number of threats against Obama.</p>
<p>We are committed to exposing those who disseminate misinformation that foments hate. Together, we took a stand, and our actions made a difference. Thank you for everything you do to combat bigotry and intolerance.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support,</p>
<p>J. Richard Cohen President,<br>
Southern Poverty Law Center</p>

		<p>Many Latinos come from countries that have no tradition of free speech. Allowable speech is whatever the &#8220;jefe&#8221; says it is. So they are confused and angry to be in a country that enshrines free speech in the Constitution. They despise our heritage and if they become a majority they will be as cruel as Pizarro in killing dissent.</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs is 64. And a couple of weeks ago some radicals fired shots into his home during a drive-by. In my opinion, the only thing those leftist radicals can take credit for is inciting violence and hatred. Still, I&rsquo;m not surprised they would stick their beaks in the air and crow. That&rsquo;s the only way they&rsquo;ll get what they&rsquo;re really after - donations.</p>
<p>Regardless, this isn&rsquo;t the first time Dobbs has left CNN. He left in &#8216;97 after a falling out. And returned in 2000 at the request of Ted Turner. I doubt he&rsquo;ll be back this time since he started a radio show this year. But I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he shows up on fox in a few months. He brings a huge audience and a lot of credibility.</p>

<p>Oh really?  Are we to think that the hispanics will consider any oppposition to ILLEGAL immigration (no matter how rational) as &#8220;respectful and civil&#8221;?</p>
<p>Dobbs never acted as described by these aliens.  He was always respectful, rational, not to mention completely correct.  </p>
<p>It is impossible to have a dissenting opinion without the ever increasing third world hordes flipping out. </p>
<p>My hope is that in the long run, Dobbs will gain even more fans and support, especially since his own home was shot at.</p>

		<p>I guess Latinos do not understand the concept of Backlash. Some of the most liberal people I know are still very much against illegal immigration. They will be even more against it when they see how such people are a threat to our right to freedom of speech.</p>

		<p>Lou will be sorely missed. His message was simple, qualify issues and determine if they are desirable or undesirable to the interests of the USA. And he did it well. He did it so well, that in my view, he should receive the Presidential Medal of Honor for his honest authentic journalism. </p>
<p>I wonder with Lou gone, how will the American public learn of issues that counter it&rsquo;s interests. Such as the United Nations Defamation of Religions Resolution which seeks to criminalize words or actions of all persons in every member nation as attacks against a particular religion, namely Islam.</p>
<p>It seeks to make religion off limits to examination by scholars, apologists, and individuals that simply wish to discuss it or exercise their freedom of speech to critisize it.</p>
<p>How will we know the plans of the globalists to strip us of our liberty without honest journalists like Lou? </p>

<p>Dobbs and Roger Ailes have already had a meeting, a month or so ago, re Dobbs to Fox Biz.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t materialize, then the gossip is that he&rsquo;ll run for public office from his current state of NJ or his native Idaho.  If that happens, then I&rsquo;d have to be a lot more critical of him, because of his lack of awareness of the race issue.</p>

		<p>Ditto my previous post. Dobb&rsquo;s removal is a TOTAL VICOTORY for all far leftist&rsquo;s including La Raza, Lulac, Maldef, Mecha, and the rest of the &#8220;hispanic ethnic interest groups&#8221;, as Mr. Dobbs used to call them. Here in California their known as reconquistas, for obvious reasons. California probably has fifty percent of the illegal aliens in the U.S.</p>

		<p>This goes to show how powerful the forces are against free speech. From what I have read, Dobbs will never find another platform like he had on CNN. His future options are uncertain. The last episode of his show was without joy or fanfare. He is obviously leaving under duress. This is not good news for anyone in favor of balance or free speech on the immigration issue. Dobbs has been harrassed and besmirched for his views for a long time now. Someone even took a shot at his home while his wife was outside. Free speech on the immigration issue in a high-profile platform like Dobbs had has now become nearly impossible. </p>

		<p>Wherever Lou Dobbs goes, I hope he continues to speak out about the invasion of our country. If these people were from other than Hispanic countries, I think the US would declare war, just as Mexico and others have on our country. For many years, I&rsquo;ve wanted armed troops on our border to stop the criminals. What is wrong with a country who ignores an invasion? We send our young men and women to protect every other nation in the world, but out elected officials leave us wide open to the hoards who are destroying our country. Let&rsquo;s stop one journey to the moon. We&rsquo;d have enough money to build a double fence and keep regiments of our military there. Then start deportation of the million who&rsquo;ve broken in. This country is our home. Would we ignore someone breaking into our personal dwellings? Then let&rsquo;s prosecute those who break into our nation. Go home or go to jail.</p>

		<p>I suspect that there is more to this than Lou&rsquo;s campaign against illegal immigration. Recently, his web site advocated disengagement of our military from overseas wars and bases-something akin to Ron Paul&rsquo;s reasoning. This went against the MSM&rsquo;s neocon agenda.  Then, of course, corporate heads do not like Lou&rsquo;s bashing of corporate outsourcing of American jobs.</p>

		<p>I stopped watching CNN&rsquo;s extreme, left-wing news shows when Campbell Brown disgraced herself by fawning over Obama during the presidential debates and then viciously attacked Sarah Palin.  In hopes that it would some day return to reporting actual &#8220;news,&#8221; I kept CNN on my channel changer, just in case.  With the departure of Lou Dobbs, the ONLY real journalist at CNN, my hope is now gone.  It&rsquo;s ironic that CNN, which was once considered a beacon of truth, is now rated lowest among news networks and is considered a joke among news watchers.  Who can blame Lou Dobbs for leaving this sinking ship.  Lou, you deserve all the success that&rsquo;s coming to you.  Best of luck.  I can now remove CNN from my channel changer.</p>

<p>Lou Dobbs was the ONLY thing CNN had going for it until he lost his voice and then CNN literally TANKED!  I hope their ratings STAY in the basement&hellip;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lou Dobbs, is now free to speak again&hellip;  May he move onward and upward and reach an even bigger audience!</p>
