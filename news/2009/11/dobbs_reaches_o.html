			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Wallsten, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs, pondering a future in politics, is trying to wipe away his image as an enemy of Latino immigrants by positioning himself as a champion of that fast-growing ethnic bloc.</p>
<p>Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs reaches out to the Latino community, possibly ahead of a political run. WSJ reporter Peter Wallsten says Mr. Dobbs is even for legalizing the undocumented now.</p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs is working to repair what a spokesman conceded is a glaring flaw: His reputation for antipathy toward Latino immigrants. In a little-noticed interview Friday, Mr. Dobbs told Spanish-language network Telemundo he now supports a plan to legalize millions of undocumented workers, a stance he long lambasted as an unfair &#8220;amnesty.&#8221;<br>
Lou Dobbs, shown appearing on NBC&rsquo;s &#8216;Today&rsquo; show last week, is working to repair his reputation for antipathy toward Latino immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you have thought of me in the past, I can tell you right now that I am one of your greatest friends and I mean for us to work together,&#8221; he said in a live interview with Telemundo&rsquo;s Maria Celeste. &#8220;I hope that will begin with Maria and me and Telemundo and other media organizations and others in this national debate that we should turn into a solution rather than a continuing debate and factional contest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs twice mentioned a possible legalization plan for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., saying at one point that &#8220;we need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants under certain conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs couldn&rsquo;t be reached Tuesday. Spokesman Bob Dilenschneider said Mr. Dobbs draws a distinction between illegal immigrants who have committed crimes since arriving in the U.S. and those who are &#8220;living upright, positive and constructive lives&#8221; who should be &#8220;integrated&#8221; into society. He said Mr. Dobbs recognizes the political importance of Latinos and is &#8220;smoothing the water and clearing the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a career as a broadcaster and Internet entrepreneur, Mr. Dobbs turned himself into a populist firebrand, campaigning against labor outsourcing, free trade and immigration.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs left CNN saying he wanted to become an advocate. Immigration advocates, including Ms. Celeste, had long called for his ouster; critics in particular cite a 2007 report on his show that cited erroneous data suggesting illegal immigrants were tied to a spike in leprosy cases in the U.S. Mr. Dobbs told Ms. Celeste the report was a mistake, and blamed a reporter ad-libbing on the air.</p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Dobbs&rsquo;s relationship with Latinos will be crucial if he chooses to run against Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), the Senate&rsquo;s lone Hispanic. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Dobbs twice mentioned a possible legalization plan for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., saying at one point that &ldquo;we need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants under certain conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a sell out and such a paper tiger.</p>
<p>Politics is his field for certain if he can flip sides at the bat of an eye and reveal that he has no principles whatsoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And, so far as these illegals getting amnesty is concerned, this country is in a really bad recession that gives every indication of falling even further with mass unemployment.  Actual unemployment now is about 30 million people.</p>
<p>Only a fool would want more incoming immigrants and amnesty for the millions that are here now, especially since they can only fill peon slots and it is the unskilled labor that is the scarcest of all.</p>
<p>I would comment about the madness of such a policy, but madness is becoming the norm is this failing empire.  A top general in the army asserts that he would rather see more deaths rather than less diversity;  a director of a military academy asserts he doesn&rsquo;t want the best, he wants the most diverse; the military brass are court martialing navy seals for popping a muderous terrorist in the mouth upon capture, after he murdered four Americans, set their bodies on fire, then dragged them through the streets afterwhich their corpses were hung from the bridge.  </p>
<p>The vast majority of the populace shouts their disapproval of transforming our health care system into one that is worse so blacks can be given free medical care, and the same majority shouts in near hysteria over invoking cap and trade mandates after the global warming scam has been proven to be a contrived trojan horse in order to get more control over the economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more.  A whole lot more.  But it would take a thick book to list all the inanities.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe none of this will ever get straighteed out.  It&rsquo;s too late.  We&rsquo;ve gone well past the point of return.</p>
<p>I admire the people who are trying anyway, but the only thing they can really do is circle the wagons and see if there is anything left worth rebuilding after the smoke clears, and make no mistake about it there will be PLENTY of smoke.</p>

<p>Like other RINOs he&rsquo;ll find that the tiny number of black and hispanic votes he&rsquo;ll pick up by pandering won&rsquo;t even compare to the huge amount of disgusted whites who&rsquo;ll now sit out the election.</p>

		<p>What else would any non-deluded, race wise observer of the rigged system expect from a TV personality, who duplicitously ad libs his employer&rsquo;s teleprompted instructions, for a targeted (read White patriotic) segment of the population. His whole purpose as a TV personality was to mollify and entertain his White audience, who, sensing that their world was in trouble, needed pacified. He made them &#8220;feel good&#8221; that somebody, somewhere was purportedly &#8220;doing something&#8221;; when the whole thing was merely a show, and nothing resulted from it. </p>
<p>Now this parody of a white ground hog thinks he can fool them again as a multi-culti, &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; people&rsquo;s tribune. And, maybe he will, if he can get bankrolled by those who want to keep the White population disorganized and befuddled.</p>

		<p>Somehow I am not surprised by this flip of Dobb&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I recall on one program he was knocking the Minutemen in Arizona who were then working the border.  I couldn&rsquo;t see if he were anti-immigrant, how could he also be anti-Minuteman?</p>
<p>Now we know.  He was the latter, but never the former.</p>
<p>It must be something in the water they drink back East.</p>
<p>At any rate, if you, dear reader, happen to be an illegal, look up Wantage, New Jersey.  There lives a man who will take you in, feed you and clothe you. He loves you.  And should you happen to turn his immediate neighborhood into a third world pit, I shall not raise a hand in protest.</p>

		<p>I do believe that I&rsquo;ve read in a number of credible places on the Web that Lou Dobbs is married to a Mexican woman.</p>
<p>And, if everyone will think back - you&rsquo;ll probably remember that Dobbs has never been outspoken about the deliberate and diabolically evil attempt by our so-called &#8216;ruling elite&rsquo; class to replace the white majority via massive LEGAL and ILLEGAL immigration from the third world.   </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that a deliberate and transparently obvious program of Government sponsored Genocide directed at the white majority population would be newsworthy enough to be discussed by anyone who was really on the side of whites.</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs wasn&rsquo;t and never has been our friend.  He&rsquo;s been a charade from the beginning - and I suspect that he was allowed to remain on the air only because his role was to serve as a kind of lightening rod, to con the angry white people into thinking we had a voice - and meanwhile, the genocide program rolled along on as before.</p>
<p>Whites need to learn to analyze these phony, false leaders or spokesman for our cause and weed out the stooges - and puppets who are offered to us to keep us hypnotized and instead find leaders who are the real deal.</p>

		<p>I saw the interview with Lou Dobbs on Telemundo. I was shocked, saddened and disappointed to see the man who had been streadfast in leading the fight against illegal immigration suddenly become a pacifier. It actually started several weeks before he left his program. I knew that La Raza and other anti-American organizations had been pressing for his firing, but I was sure he&rsquo;d continue to be the primary spokesman against the invasion. But all references to this were stopped. The only mention a couple of times was to &#8220;illegal immigrants.&#8221; I then thought when he left CNN, he&rsquo;d be the old Lou, tackling the problem with fire and brimstone. Then came the interview. He wants legalization of the millions here and a &#8220;discussion&#8221; of the problem. Sounds an awful lot like &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; reform, and we all know what that means. There will never be another Lou and what a shame that he also had his price&hellip;a senate seat, perhaps?</p>

		<p>I said a few weeks ago when he left CNN that if he entered politics, I would have to be more critical of him.  And that was based on what I already knew, before he started pandering and backsliding.  </p>
<p>Of course, if one paid attention, it&rsquo;s really not true that he is &#8220;backsliding&#8221; in the literal definition of the word, because he was already &#8220;back&#8221; there to begin with.  If your only problem with immigration is the illegality of illegal aliens, then it stands to reason you should advocate for amnesty, because that would instantly take care of the only problem you say you have.</p>
<p>Bigoted little ole me, however, thinks that the immigration issue is an issue of racial replacement and dispossession.</p>

<p>How about fearful for the continued existence of himself and his family members? Maybe they made him an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse, so he used all of his showbiz and advertising skills to prove he had a change of heart. In the former Soviet Union they had show trials where the &#8220;guilty&#8221; confessed; In South Africa there were &#8220;reconciliation panels.&#8221; Here in America halfway through transition to coloured rule, perhaps an appearance on Telemundo serves the same purpose. Viva Lou Dobbs! </p>

		<p>So now it is absolutetly crucial for White conservative politicians to pander-hand over OUR AMERICA- to hispanic invaders from mexico,central america and cuba otherwise they can&rsquo;t win. </p>
<p>I hope Dobbs does do this. AS far as the NATIVE BORN WHITE RACIALIST REVOLT goes, this would be a very good thing for it will expose Lou Dobbs for what he is&hellip;a race-replacement enthusiast&hellip;.race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population through a massive increase in high fertility post-1965 hispanics,mulims,asians and africans&hellip;LEGAL IMMIGRATION that is-full speed ahead!!!! </p>

		<p>I more or less suspected that he was playing both ends against the middle.  I agree with the other writer who said his program was done more to mollify their white audience than anything else.  Well, from what I&rsquo;ve read, he has received an $8 million dollar severance package, so it is a probably given for a job well done.</p>
<p>I had written him a couple of times and aksed him why he didn&rsquo;t do a show about the harmful effects of affirmative action policies on the white working class.  I thought at the time that it really would have made a lot of sense for him to devote an entire program to this horrendous policy but evidently he is not really against it.  Now, we see that he is in fact pandering to the racists at La Raza and those other agencies that advocate for the takeover of the USA and our demise.  I&rsquo;m afraid too that we white conservatives really have nobody in the REpublican Party to champion our cause.  Sarah Palin seems to follow the party line as to immigration and the affirmative action policies already in place.  I pity the young white males who are just entering the work place.  They stand the chance of a snowball in hell.  Lou Dobbs should hang his head in shame.</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs and Sarah Palin</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs now favors amnesty for illegal aliens. The fact is Lou Dobbs was never one of us. His wife is Hispanic, Mexican I believe. It is true that for a while he talked a good talk on immigration and trade issues, but he was never a race realist. Liberal propaganda to the contrary, Dobbs only problem with Mexican immigration was with illegal immigration. </p>
<p>In reality it doesn&rsquo;t matter if Mexican immigration is legal or illegal, the problem is that millions of Mexicans are coming into the US and taking jobs, driving down wages, taking government money and benefits while bringing crime, disease and poverty. I am still against it, even if the US government does grant them amnesty and make it &#8220;legal&#8221;, it will still be a disaster. Let me ask, will the disaster be any less because it has been declared &ldquo;legal&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs is interested in entering politics, and politicians almost always sell us out. PUT NOT YOUR FAITH IN POLITICIANS. We should concentrate our efforts on educating ordinary whites about race. We should stop looking desperately for friends in the organized media and on talk radio. None of these people are true allies of ours, none of them are men of principle, all of them care about their personal advancement and profit above all else. In fact these same individuals, if a public race realist were to praise them or offer them support would quickly attack the person in question and denounce them as being an evil &ldquo;racist&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Try it and see, call one of them up if you have to.</p>
<p>Please my fellow white race realists wake up and stop supporting and praising men and women who don&rsquo;t support you. Sarah Palin is another good example of this desperation on the part of whites to find a hero where one does not exist she is married to a man who is a quarter Inuit. There is no reason to believe she does or ever will hold anything like race realist views. I for one am also tired of hearing her praised as a great family woman, she had a child then went to work the very next day, doesn&rsquo;t sound like mother of the year material to me. One of her daughters had a child out of wedlock. If you want to lavish praise on a woman, how about Michelle Duggar, in my mind she is far more deserving of it. We need more Mrs. Duggars and less Sarah Palins.</p>
<p>Once someone gets a taste of money or power it is unlikely I might even say impossible that they will adopt views which would destroy their political future. Like it or not at present most whites do not think like we do. It is not realistic to believe that prominent politicians or news anchors or talk radio hosts will embrace race realism given that it would certainly destroy their livelihoods. Please my fellow race realists stop supporting people who favor multi-racialism, stop looking for hero&rsquo;s where they do not exist.<br>

		<p>Dobbs was never particularly good on the big problem of legal immigration.While he did much to raise consciousness on illegal immigration  &mdash;  I always wondered if his spiel was just to fill a ratings niche.The MSM media does such a poor job on immigration and trade issues.<br>
Now,he has shown himself to be a sellout.We can only trust a few prominent figures to be consistently on our side  &mdash;   the Buchanan&rsquo;s and Tancredo come to mind.Dobbs has proven to be a facile liar and panderer.He repulses me.</p>

		<p>I have to say I am disappointed though.  It certainly appears that Lou Dobbs sold out, but he could have just modified his positions and stayed on at CNN.  Perhaps there is another reason, specifically did some organization or people &#8220;get to him&#8221; and basically forced him to change his positions?  Factor also there was nothing approaching a logical statement forthcoming by Dobbs or CNN as to why he had to leave the network on a day&rsquo;s notice makes this more intriguing.</p>
<p>Considering more than a few politicians have taken the same route as Dobbs, i.e. they start out strong on immigration control and then become more lenient would indicate there are other forces at work.  I am not inherently a &#8220;conspiracy theorist&#8221; type, however, these scenarios have occurred far too often to indicate random outcomes.  If these were random outcomes then a number of politicians who were advocates of lenient immigration enforcement would turn more conservative and that never occurs unless they temporarily talk &#8220;tough&#8221; a few weeks before a close election.</p>
<p>So has our &#8220;shadow government&#8221; decided that the time is right for a major amnesty bill, and wanted the most prominent opponent of previous amnesty bills out of the way, even &#8220;turned him around&#8221;???</p>
<p>We live in very dangerous times.<br>

		<p>To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m not overly bothered by this.  There is no chance of an open white nationalist getting elected in this country, so I am okay with him toning down his real views while campaigning.  The real question for me will be what does he do while in office.</p>

		<p>It looks like Dobbs finally lost his nerve.  He had to show his true colors, one way or another.</p>
<p>But even Fox News is caving to pressure.  They are now doing what CNN does, having a Obama style mullatto paired with a pretty white woman for its morning news story delivery.  This morning, I actually watched a replication of what often goes on during CNN shows; the black male makes a joke, they both laugh, and he reaches over and touches her, this time on the leg, while saying, &#8220;You&rsquo;re my girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that the entire situation is growing worse.  In the mean time, every white person I speak to seems to be noticing it all and are becoming fed up.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with Sofita on this. How many politicians are really candid  when campaigning?  How many can AFFORD to be? They have to be practical, not idealistic.  What matters is what they do once in  office. He&rsquo;s already made his views well known to us  over the past.  He&rsquo;s not a WN, he isn&rsquo;t  one of us   &mdash;   we know that   &mdash;   but we also know where he stands.  </p>
<p>In other words, he&rsquo;s not the best, but he&rsquo;s better than nothing.<br>
I doubt that he&rsquo;s changed his stripes overnight.  And I doubt that his enemies are going to believe that either.</p>

		<p>This indicates to me that Lou Dobbs has absolutely ZERO political sense, and has no hope of being elected to anything.</p>
<p>His base is those who oppose illegal immigration.  Pandering to hispanics means losing his (big) base for the dubious possiblity of maybe picking up part of a much smaller voting bloc.</p>
<p>It would be like Sarah Palin announcing she&rsquo;s pro-abortion &amp; pro-gun control.  Her base would unanimously reject her, while the other side still wouldn&rsquo;t trust her.</p>

		<p>That some here STILL defend Dobbs shows all who are willing to see, exactly why our people are losing this racial struggle. Capitualtion of this nature just smacks of desperation and makes us look weak and unfocused. Again, little wonder we continue to lose this battle of ideas.  </p>

		<p>I think something should be set straight: Lou Dobbs has feelings of antipathy for illegal Latino immigrants. Not for legal Latino immigrants, or for Latino people as a whole!</p>
<p>I think this distinction really matters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I very much doubt Latinos like mister Dobbs very much, since they seem to think they own the U.S.</p>
<p>I think Lou should stay true to himself and his ideas, and remain a voice against illegal Latino immigration. Hey, no matter what Soledad O&rsquo;Brien says, they are not the majority yet!</p>
