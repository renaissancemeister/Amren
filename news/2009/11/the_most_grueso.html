<h1><a href="/ar/2006/11/index.html#article3">The Most Gruesome Multi-Cult of All?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Richardson, American Renaissance, November 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Almost everyone has heard of the charismatic cult leader Jim Jones, and the 1978 mass suicide to which he led his followers in the South American nation of Guyana. Far less well known is that Jones was an early proponent of the anti-white, racial diversity thinking that is now so widespread.</p>
<p>Jim Jones was born in Indiana in 1931. He began preaching in his 20s, even though he had no formal religious training, and mixed religion and politics while still a young man. His views were radically politically correct, even by today&rsquo;s standards, let alone those of the 1950s. His religious style was charismatic, and included faith healing.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo;s belief in &#8220;equality and justice&#8221; led him to start his own racially integrated church in Indianapolis, which he first named Community Unity and later The Peoples Temple. In 1958, Jones started what he called his Rainbow Family by adopting three Korean children and a black boy. His one biological child was named Stephen Gandhi Jones.</p>
<p>Jones impressed the authorities in Indianapolis with his multi-racial efforts. In 1960, the mayor named him president of the Indianapolis Commission on Human Rights, with a salary of $7,000 a year, but he decided to move his church to California.</p>
<p>Again, Jones won favor with the authorities. He was elected president of the Grand Jury of Mendocino County, and after moving to San Francisco, the church grew to over 7,500 members. In 1975 he mobilized 800 members to work full-time for the successful mayoral campaign of George Moscone.</p>
<p>In 1976, he bused in hundreds of followers to a campaign meeting with Rosalynn Carter, wife of the future president. His photo appeared with Mrs. Carter in the papers the next day, and the President-elect invited him to Washington for the inauguration. Then-California State Assemblyman Willie Brown said, &#8220;San Francisco needs 10 more Jim Jones,&#8221; and helped to have him appointed by Mayor Moscone to the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission.</p>
<p>Despite these honors, there was an investigation of the church for tax evasion, and Jones moved the church again, this time to a commune in Guyana. Jonestown, founded in the summer of 1976 along with about 1,000 followers, did not last long. In November 1978, a congressman named Leo Ryan flew to Guyana, and spent three days investigating complaints in Jonestown. Fourteen of Jones&rsquo;s followers, unhappy with life in Jonestown, asked to fly back to the United States with Ryan. At the airstrip, just as the congressman&rsquo;s party was about to leave, a truckload of Jonestown security guards arrived and started shooting, killing Congressman Ryan and four others.</p>
<p>Jones then decided on mass &#8220;revolutionary suicide,&#8221; a phrase he borrowed from Black Panther leader Huey Newton. On Jones&rsquo;s instructions, all members of the cult were to drink cyanide-laced Flavor Aid (a Kool-Aid knock-off). Children were poisoned first, then adults. Some were shot trying to leave. In all 914 died, including 276 children.</p>
<p>Jones eventually became a kind of communist in his politics, but much of what he and his followers stood for is very close to the politically correct mainstream. The goal of Jonestown was to build an agricultural paradise free of sexism and racism. As part of this program, Jones promoted mixed-race marriage and adoption of bi-racial children. He also taught that all inequality was caused by white male oppression.</p>
<p>In Jones&rsquo;s view, white men were the enemy. He believed the world might be destroyed either by nuclear war or by genocide against people of color. Church members went through radical loyalty tests called &#8220;white nights,&#8221; so named because of Jones&rsquo;s belief that white men were trying to ruin his project. One church member wrote a final testament praising Jonestown because there were &#8220;no more racist tears from whites and others who thought they were better.&#8221; Jones even claimed that the final suicide decision was necessary because some of his white followers had defected and wanted to escape with Congressman Ryan. About 80 percent of his followers were black, but Jones made intelligent but gullible white women his chief assistants and main sex partners.</p>
<p>A Temple member named Edith Roller wrote in her diary about a boxing match between a young man accused of sexism, and a young woman. The woman knocked out the man, to the delight of the crowd.</p>
<p>Jones was dictator of Jonestown. He insisted that some couples divorce and remarry partners of his own choosing, and he had the right to have sex with anyone he liked. Armed guards patrolled the perimeter, and there were public beatings of disobedient children. Members who failed to meet work targets or who criticized Jones&rsquo;s management could have their heads shaved, or be forced to wear a yellow hat or a special badge of dishonor. His followers did not address him by some fancy title; they called him &#8220;Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Jones was a preacher, and claimed to be the reincarnation of Jesus, Akhenaten, Buddha, Lenin, and Father Divine, it is not clear how religious he really was. He once said, &#8220;If there were no rich, no poor, if everyone were equal, religion would soon disappear.&#8221; One Jonestown survivor, asked if Jones was mainly interested in socialism or Christianity, answered, &#8220;Jim was a socialist first and an atheist second.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a larger sense, there are two main conclusions to be drawn from the Jim Jones story. The first is that politically correct liberals ought to be embarrassed by Jonestown but are not. A pioneer of racial diversity and feminism led a large movement to a grisly end of murder and mass suicide. If a conservative or nationalist had done this we would never be allowed to forget it.</p>
<p>The other is that many political moderns feel divorced from the world as it is constituted, and Jones took this feeling to a radical conclusion. Not only did he try to reconstitute society as a utopian commune, he drove his followers to suicide as a final act of renunciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were too good for this world&#8221; said Jim Jones as his followers prepared to die. One devotee left behind a note addressed to Jim Jones, in which he wrote, &#8220;Dad, I can see no way out, I agree with your decision .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am more than tired of this wretched, merciless planet and the hell it holds for so many masses of beautiful people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is living which is treacherous&#8221; was one of Jones&rsquo;s last pronouncements before he, too, committed what he called &#8220;revolutionary suicide&#8221; by putting a bullet through his head.</p>

		<p>PBS had a documentary about the Jones cult that touched on many of these same facts.  In addition to all this:</p>
<p>(1)  Jones&rsquo;s church/cult and its activism made the difference in the 1975 SF city elections.  Their votes and GOTV efforts are what put George Moscone over the top.</p>
<p>(2)  Jones&rsquo;s mind control over the members of his cult was so bad that, while they were in Guyana, Jones convinced them that the United States and its whites were on the verge of committing total genocide against blacks, and had already wiped out a good percentage of the black population.  This was during the Jimmy Carter administration, the most liberal President between LBJ and Obama.</p>
<p>What PBS got half-baked is that they presented Jones and his cult as something that &#8220;went awry,&#8221; or a train that went off the track.  They can&rsquo;t bring themselves to admit that egalitarianism itself is the problem, and that it will beget more people like Jim Jones, even less malignant ones.  If your foundation is a lie, then the rest of your house will also be a lie.</p>

		<p>The way I recall the media portraying the Jones tragedy is that he was a &#8220;racist&#8221; who chose blacks as his victims simply because they were easy targets. This would seem to be quite contrary to the true picture. Don&rsquo;t expect the MSM to ever tell you the truth on this matter, however.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think our country is run by Jonestown utopians. It may be true that many journalists, professors, and other people associated with the chattering classes show signs of having Jim Jones Syndrome. But I think our society is run by capitalists who don&rsquo;t care about anything except making money. Maybe that&rsquo;s the great danger. The morons who take multiculturalism seriously, who make a religion out of it, will eventually blame the Toxic Other  &mdash;  be it capitalists, racists, sexists, homophobes, etc.  &mdash;  for their failure to create a perfect universe.</p>

		<p>After reading this Classic AR article, I have come tto understand how Jones&rsquo; congregation was overwhelmingly Bantu - as long as he preached an &#8220;it&rsquo;s all the white man&rsquo;s fault&#8221; sermon, he had his receptive audience. The only difference between Jones and the likes of Elijah Muhammad, Adam Clayton Powell, Jesse Jackson, Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan is skin pigmentation. The message of the demagogue is the same.</p>
<p>Until reading this article, I never knew Jones was in favor of race-mixing and blaming all of the world&rsquo;s problems on the Caucasian race. He was of course, a race traitor, but, like so many traitors before him chose suicide as the way out. In this respect he was like Judas Iscariot. </p>

		<p>One reason Jim Jones was so popular among Frisco Democrats is that when a politician wanted to appear at a rally or a public speech Jones would send a large contingent of cult members to show up; this made it seem like the politcian was supported by &#8220;the people&#8221;.</p>
<p>ACORN provides a similar service to modern Democrats.</p>

		<p>I have read that Jim Jones and Adolph Hitler were vegetarians.  I have also read that Charles Manson, at least before he was sent to prison, either was, or is, a vegetarian.  One theory I read to explain why such evil people could be vegetarians, is that maybe a vegetarian diet deprives the human body of certain nutrients the body needs, ilke Vitamin B-12.</p>
<p>In other words, not all vegetarians are nice, humanitarian people like rock star Paul McCartney!</p>

<p>Yes Christianity does say all men are equal but I don&rsquo;t think that is the real problem. </p>
<p>The problem is not just with Christianity but with all religions. Religions are the seed-bed of mind control. Instead of thinking for themselves people decide to let someone else do their thinking for them. Christianity means whatever the church says it means at any given time. The church goes with the money and the power. At the present the money and power is promoting an egalitarian messege and the church as usual is up for sale. When the slavery message was where the money and power were the church promoted slavery. </p>
<p>Find a way to control large portions of the population and you to can be rich and powerfull. Priest learned this long ago. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against anyone believing in a God or even many Gods but believing in a church or church leaders is dangerous. Both Christianity and Budism teach people to be aware of false teachers and leaders that will lead them down the wrong path. When people follow like sheep they end up like sheep, it&rsquo;s not good. </p>

<p>The radio talk show host born Michael Alan Weiner (I think his stage surname might be a prohibited word here) had an interesting theory last night re some vegetarians and vegans.  (But not all.)  He thinks they&rsquo;re overcompensating for some other guilt, either they abuse some sort of drug, or they have some skeleton in their closet.</p>

<p>Well, no.  At least part of the mass suicide was video-taped. You can probably find that on-line with a little searching.  Those who didn&rsquo;t volunteer to drink poison were forced at gunpoint by other members.  It was clearly not an outside job at all. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be a trator to a race, unless it&rsquo;s your own race.  In Jones&rsquo; case,  this was the inner conflict of a tormented personality torn between races, not knowing who he was or where he belonged.  As a result of his racial torment, hundreds died. </p>
<p>I remember when that event happened, and I recall the many stories that came out of it. I do clearly remember that Jim Jones had made a very big thing about race-mixing because HE HIMSELF was an example of race-mixing.  Like most mixed-breeds, he was obsessed with the subject.   He championed Indian causes and made a big thing of his Cheokkee blood. This fact came out at the time. I guess in &#8216;78 the media were still not so PC or nervous about covering up racial facts, as they are now  (bad as they already were back then). Now, on checking Wiki and elsewhere, I can find almost NOTHING about that at all. There is just a small  footnote in which a cousin of his mother  denies any Indian blood in the family. Her denial is accepted with further question.</p>
<p><br>
While a cousin denied that there was  &#8220;an ounce of indian blood in our family&#8221;, one glance at his photograph puts that denial to rest. <br>
<a href="/wiki/File_01-jones-jim.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:01-jones-jim.jpg</a></p>
<p>  <i>While Jim Jones claimed to be partially of Cherokee descent through his mother Lynetta,  a cousin Barbara Shaffer said &#8220;there wasn&rsquo;t an ounce of Indian in our family.&#8221; She said Lynetta was Welsh.</i><br>
 Incidentally, the birth records for Lynetta have since been &#8220;lost&#8221;.   But his face speaks for itself.<br>

		<p>Daniel:</p>
<p>If Christianity requires racially egalitarian public and private policy, why did it take nineteen and a half centuries for Christianity to recognize it?  The Catholic schools in St. Louis were segregated until just after WWII.  The last STL Archbishop to preside over segregated Catholic schools, John Glennon, might as well have been Theodore Bilbo on racial issues.  An Archbishop, mind you.  Hand-chosen by the Pope.</p>
<p>JustPlainMean:</p>
<p>On the surface, Jim Jones was anti-gun.  But when it came time for the mass suicides, those who didn&rsquo;t want to go were murdered.  One of the survivors told the PBS film crew that he &#8220;wanted to know where all the (expletive) all these guns came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>ghw:</p>
<p>Most Southern whites have some Amerindian in them.  Yet, they&rsquo;re also the biggest anti-integrationists and racial realists among us.  If Jones was part Indian, it was only very small, and something else was at work to make him that demented, although most of it wasn&rsquo;t a result of mental illness per se, but a lust for personal power.</p>

<p>The communist Christianity of today is egalitarian. Remember, Paul said if you don&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t eat. This is quite a difference from the Catholic/Lutheran charity fools who bring in non-whites to go on welfare.  Communism/atheism is using the pseudo Christianity of today, which they created, as a shield.  Then they will blame the hell that they created on Christianity.  Christians will be persecuted and the monster will be alive and well.  Are we really this naive?</p>

		<p>Some people are insane.  I can&rsquo;t understand how others follow idiots to their death.  Idealism, Utopianism are the paths that lead to extreme dissatisfaction and often insanity. <br>
Reality throughout history never produced a completely equal human equation. I don&rsquo;t think everyone wants to live, eat, work, think the same.  We do not all look alike and we are born different.  Once the globe was divided by race/cultures. Boundaries are best solutions to the chosen differences of different peoples.  The problems arise from economics.  The prosperous are always invaded by thieves and those who have no interest in building thier own group but instead prefer to steal and blame others for their own faults.   V</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>The  Indian element must have been more than &#8220;very small&#8221; in his case.  Have you looked at the picture?  I remember noticing that first thing when I saw his pictures back in 1978. Just as with Lt. Calley  (remember him?),  I instantly thought &hellip;&#8221;this is no white man!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for mental illness, according to the wiki biog. his childhood  acquaintances remembered him as  a &#8220;really weird kid&#8221; who used to hold funerals for animals and once stabbed a cat.  His childhood heroes were Stalin, Mao and such.  He and his wife were the first white couple  in Indiana  to adopt a black child. He was heavily into communism even then.  This in Middle America! &hellip;  where such Marxist  beliefs back in the Cold War  era would have labeled anyone as a real wacko and social outcast.   But in California he found a more fertile field to plough.</p>

		<p>Christianity may say that all humans have a soul, but this statement does not mean that all White Christians automatically embrace blacks as the equals of Whites. Those who worked as missionaries in 19th century Africa did not contemplate building a society in which both races would co-exist peaceably. </p>

		<p>Regarding the comments on vegetarians, I myself am a vegetarian. I don&rsquo;t think a vegetarian diet per se makes you a sociopath, it is just people involved in left wing, socialist or hippy/new age circles often face strong pressure and stigmatization to go vegetarian. It is their immersion in these circles rather than their food that leads people down strange paths.  </p>

		<p>While Jim Jones claimed to be partially of Cherokee descent through his mother Lynetta, a cousin Barbara Shaffer said &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t an ounce of Indian in our family.&rdquo; She said Lynetta was Welsh.<br>
Incidentally, the birth records for Lynetta have since been &ldquo;lost&rdquo;. But his face speaks for itself.   &mdash;  ghw </p>
<p>Yeah, but look at some other famous Welsh Joneses:</p>
<p>Katherine Zeta Jones</p>
<p>Tom Jones</p>
<p>They both are dark haired, dark eyed and Mediterranean looking, like many Welsh folks.  Perhaps Jim Jones just wanted to be Cherokee,  so he could relate to his oppressed flock.</p>

		<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe Christianity is the problem.  </p>
<p>Did you guys read the article, &#8220;Jones was a socialist first and an atheist second.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>The main tenets of Communism and Socialism are professed equality for everyone and atheism for all.  Of course, communism has failed miserably, but like most strands of liberalism, the facts don&rsquo;t matter.  </p>
<p>Jim Jones was a nutty cult leader that we have seen many times.  If there is a lesson to be learned, it is once the cult takes all of your possessions, and in exchange promise to take care of you, you then become very easy to control and compliant.  That lesson does resemble communism in general.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I always suspected the &lsquo;colonists&rsquo; were killed by the locals, with the mass-suicide camp being a cover. I have absolutely no evidence, but it&rsquo;s what I suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CIA were most certainly involved in this incident.</p>
<p>Congressman Leo Ryan was a perpetual thron in the side of the CIA for years and when he visited Jonestown,they used it as an opprtunity to take him out.<br>
When Jones&rsquo;s acolytes began shooting the planes, they killed everyone they could find except a guy called Dwyer from the US Embassy in Guyana who was later revealed to be a CIA agent.</p>
<p>Dwyer later returned to Jonestown after the massacre and used a CIA phoneline to report what had happened. He is also belived to have been the one who shot Jim Jones in the head.</p>

Those who worked as missionaries in  Africa did not contemplate building a society in which both races would [be equal].<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That is exactly so.   Just read the opinions of Albert Schweitzer regarding the nature of Africans, whom he considered children that had to be guided and taken care of.  He devoted his life to working among them, but he had  no delusions about considering them &#8220;equal&#8221;.   He was very frank about that at a time when it was possible to say so.  This was just before the religion of Political correctness took hold. (He died in 1965.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that he was a very famous man in his time, Nobel Prize (1952) and regarded as a hero, but today you hardly hear anything about him at all. He&rsquo;s become an embarassment to the left and has been conveniently forgotten, a non-person. He didn&rsquo;t say what they want to hear. Today, he&rsquo;s just another &#8220;old, dead white man&#8221;, swept under the rug and forgotten.</p>

		<p>&#8220;One reason Jim Jones was so popular among Frisco Democrats is that when a politician wanted to appear at a rally or a public speech Jones would send a large contingent of cult members to show up;&#8221;</p>
<p>Right! Jones had AN ENTIRE FLEET OF BUSES AT HIS DISPOSAL FOR THIS PURPOSE. He was able to muster in two hours a large contingent of hundreds folks for who ever need a large crowd at a rally. A mob [rent-a-mob] of &#8220;trained seals&#8221; able to clap, applaud and cheer on command!</p>
<p>Violating the very persons of just about every male around him. Had a big desire to &#8220;do&#8221; every male within reach of him. Jim wanted to &#8220;know you&#8221; in a big way. Jim &#8220;knew&#8221; his flock!</p>

		<p>ghw, Schweitzer is (was) the last Christian.</p>
<p>Schweitzer was too intelligent to be a fundamentalist, and too much of a Christian to not care for others.</p>
<p>His book about the historical Jesus, as opposed to the Jesus of faith, is still quite relevant today. The hisorical Jesus is quite a different character from the Jesus of faith.</p>
<p>Schweitzer was running on the fumes, and the fumes only, of a Christianity that was, to all appearances, on its death bed.</p>
<p>In short, Schweitzer was the servant of an impotent Christianity, a Christianity that had been castrated of the miraculous, and which demanded service to others because of its latent liberalism. Is this really a reason to go tramping about the jungles, trying to help those who are wondering what the h#ll you are doing there, and why you should care?</p>
<p>Schweitzer&rsquo;s comments about the black man, however, are the wise counsels of a good man, a man who wanted all men to be in the image of God.</p>
<p>I propose another way, a way of racial fidelity. Leave other races alone. Work for the benefit of your own race; stop seeking the approval of those who do not share your values, and care nothing for your way of life.</p>
<p>Love them by leaving them alone.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Strange, the connection between egalitarianism and Christianity.</p>
<p>Or maybe it isn&rsquo;t strange. Maybe Christianity is the seed-bed of egalitarianism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; If anyone takes the trouble to read up on the history of the early church, they would find that it was in fact, the first world model of communism.  In the Roman world, many believed as today, that the end was near and wanted out.  So the second century church had many converts that took the gospel concernng riches and salvation seriously and gave everything to the various early churches whether they were in Asian Minor (today&rsquo;s Turkey) or elsewhere as in Greece, Alexandria, and later Rome.  Many wealthy joined and gave everything they owned.  The church redistributed it to the more numerous poor converts and set up a storm of conversion by being the first social system for general population support (outside of Jewish religious enclaves) in the known world.  Also, many converts were so eager to get into the Kingdom of Heaven that they were commiting suicide by rushing groups of Roman militia, who would oblige and kill them or capture and crucify them.  Later, this suicidal fervor was accomodated in the various arenas in the Roman world, not just Rome.  There are extant second century records that reflect this condition and the eventual creation of the forbading of suicide was a direct result of this early Christian suicidal fervor.  And then we have the gospels and Paul&rsquo;s letters that over and over again enforce the practices of egalitarianism.  &#8220;Jesus Loves the Little Children&#8221; is not a communist inspired song, yet it as well as so much other scripture and actual historical practice supports the practices that are egalitarian and could be easily seen as proto-communist.  Karl Marx himself converted to Christianity and THEN was inspired to write the Communist Manifesto.  He was simply educated and aware enough to understand the history of the church&rsquo;s dominance and oppression of the individual, so he concocted a theoretic economic system that did not have a religion to brain wash and turn people into easily sheared sheep.  &#8220;The opiate of the masses,&#8221; he wrote.  No wonder absolute monarchs loved the idea and supported it!  (I do not support either absolute capitalism or communism).</p>
<p>By the middle ages the church had become a closed communal system that supported just the clergy, Bishops, and the Pope, with the flock regularly sheared.  This led to peasant uprising such as the Peasant&rsquo;s Revolt of 1380 and the Reformation.  Yet, that too, became exploitive and an oppression to the poor and powerless.  Only the groundswell that led to the Renaissance and then The Enlightenment saved Europeans from the various abuses of the church. And as we can see today, re - the recent Catholic abuses of hundreds of children in Ireland, the people still suffer under the incredibly evil systems that Christianity always gives rise to.</p>

<p>&#8220;The communist Christianity of today is egalitarian. Remember, Paul said if you don&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t eat. This is quite a difference from the Catholic/Lutheran charity fools who bring in non-whites to go on welfare. Communism/atheism is using the pseudo Christianity of today, which they created, as a shield. Then they will blame the hell that they created on Christianity. Christians will be persecuted and the monster will be alive and well. Are we really this naive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Umm, in the communist model, everyone works.  However, they work to excess for little or no reward.  Such views as above can only be arrived at through a lack of actual knowledge and extreme, wishful thinking.  I ask rather, are we this uninformed and desparate to hang onto a religion that brutalized Europe for centuries and continues to betray its practioners today?</p>
<p>Wake up!  The future of the white race would be better served if it were to dump all these oppressive religions.  Any future religion must be race and ethnically centered and IMO, focus on respect (worship) of ancestors.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The first is that politically correct liberals ought to be embarrassed by Jonestown but are not. A pioneer of racial diversity and feminism led a large movement to a grisly end of murder and mass suicide&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think the politically correct would have learned a few of the same lessons from the old Soviet Union, but they haven&rsquo;t, or ignore 63 million dead due to the egalitarian/utopian lie  &mdash;  these experiments, played out on innocent victims, inevitably end in disaster, as it did in Jonestown. </p>
<p>Of course, the new PC masters in the west want to take the role of New Soviet Boss and lord over the rest of us  &mdash;   with utter power over life and death.</p>
<p>As for Jones, Jack Cashill, in his wonderful book, &#8216;What&rsquo;s the Matter with California&rsquo; relates the following (p.142):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Jones recounted years later:  &#8216;I decided how I can demonstrate my Marxism. The thought was infiltrate the church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did this by recruiting hundreds of Christian Blacks, shifting their focus from Jesus to Marx all the while reinforcing their fear of White America.</p>
<p>Jones made no bones about his distaste for religion.  In his own reminiscences,  Jones called religion a &#8216;dark creation&rsquo; of the oppressed&hellip;.He had his people write hateful, racist letters and attribute them to lesser White people.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times named Jones &#8216;humanitarian of the year.&rsquo;&hellip;  Jones reflected, &#8216;there wasn&rsquo;t a person that attended any of my meetings that did not hear me say, at one time, that I was a communist.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones used fear of Whites (offering protection from them), beatings and rape to keep his minions in line  &mdash;  then when things went wrong, he blamed White America.  918 died in Jonestown, 276 of them children  &mdash;  and not for religion. </p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the media still write of this disaster as a &#8216;mass suicide&rsquo; caused by &#8216;religion gone awry&rsquo; when it was the false messages of a communist messiah that led to massive death and destruction, just as in the old USSR.</p>
