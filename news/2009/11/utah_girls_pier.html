<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091108/US.India.in.America/">Utah Girl&rsquo;s Pierced Nose: US-Indian Culture Clash</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Comcast News, November 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To 12-year-old Suzannah Pabla, piercing her nose was a way to connect with her roots in India. To Suzannah&rsquo;s school, it was a dress-code violation worthy of a suspension.</p>
<p>To other Indians, the incident was emblematic of how it can still be difficult for the American melting pot to absorb certain aspects of their cultural and religious traditions.</p>
<p>Suzannah was briefly suspended last month from her public school in Bountiful, Utah, for violating a body-piercing ban. School officials  &mdash;  who noted that nose piercing is an Indian cultural choice, not a religious requirement  &mdash;  compromised and said she could wear a clear, unobtrusive stud in her nose, and Suzannah returned to her seventh-grade class.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to feel more closer to my family in India because I really love my family,&#8221; said Suzannah, who was born in Bountiful. Her father was born in India as a member of the Sikh religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s true that the nose ring is mainly a cultural thing for most Indians,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;Even if it is just culture, culture matters. And her right to express or explore it seems to me at least as important as her right to express her religious identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people presume I&rsquo;m an immigrant, a foreigner,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;As a child of immigrants, you often don&rsquo;t feel fully American. The presumption is that you are somehow foreign to a core American identity. You always feel a little bit of an outsider, even in your own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 2.6 million people of Indian ancestry live in the United States, including immigrants and natives, according to a 2007 U.S. Census estimate. The Indian population increased rapidly after a 1965 change to immigration law, which ended preferences given to specific European nations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like Singh, Nankani is frequently asked questions about her culture and religion  &mdash;  are Hindus really polytheistic? (Yes, but all the Hindu gods are really one.) Does she eat meat? (No.) Does she celebrate Thanksgiving? (Yes  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s an American citizen.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we all trying to look alike? Is that what makes a better student, a better school?&#8221; Singh asked. &#8220;Or a better country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those young people who invest in their ethnic backgrounds,&#8221; she said, &#8220;seem to actually do more with their lives than less.&#8221;<br>

The policy was in place before this girl made this an issue.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of chipping away at every standard we have to the point where there are no rules; everything goes, to each his own.</p>
<p>She needs to find a school that allows piercings. I&rsquo;d bet she wouldn&rsquo;t want to attend such a school.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute.  This is impossible.  I thought we are always taught that Indian immigrants are equal to whites and Northeast Asian immigrants when it comes to civilization level.  I am constantly lectured on this even by some of our faithful posters on this website.  How is it possible that immigrants from a Third World nation would bring a Third World culture with them?  Never would have guessed.</p>

<p>You ARE a foreigner, you AREN&rsquo;T fully American, you ARE foreign to a core American identity, you ARE an outsider, this IS NOT your country. Can I go to India and expect to be accepted as an Indian?</p>
<p> &ldquo;I wanted to feel more closer to my family in India because I really love my family,&rdquo; said Suzannah, who was born in Bountiful.</p>
<p>I know an easy way you can &#8220;feel more closer&#8221; to your family in India, hon - move to India you idiot, and PLEASE take your &#8220;culture&#8221; with you. </p>

My heart goes with you, Suzannah. Here is my help. You buy a one-way ticket back to India and I will send you my heartiest farewell, because you have every right not only feel closer to your family but to live with them in the dear to your heart India for the rest of your life.<br>

		<p>Americans don&rsquo;t pierce their noses?!</p>
<p>What on earth are you doing in Mormon country?&hellip;where even caffeine is a no-no.</p>
<p>&#8220;The presumption is that you are somehow foreign to a core American identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no presumption, only acknowledgement that you are NOT of British (English/Scottish) settler descent and are therefore FOREIGN to the core American identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those young people who invest in their ethnic backgrounds seem to actually do more with their lives than less.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, real Americans are expected to divest from their British ethnic backgrounds as a convenience to foreigners.<br>

White Britons born in colonial India never considered themselves &#8216;Indian&rsquo; because they weren&rsquo;t of the same racial stock.  </p>
<p>White Britons born in colonial Hong Kong never considered themselves &#8216;Chinese&rsquo; because they were not of the Chinese racial stock.</p>
<p>China and India are defined by the connection between blood and soil. Whites living there considered themselves to be Westerners living abroad.  White Westerners have never been fully accepted in sub-Saharan Africa, no matter how many generations they descend from. Their actions in Africa remain under scrutiny by blacks and whites alike. </p>
<p>The American identity is white and Western. An East Indian claiming to be American is disputing the white Western existence, and is disputing the moral right of whites to exclusively claim North America as our home. Tomorrow he could be calling it Indian territory.  On certain Sikh websites, they already do.</p>
<p>Whites must wake up!  We have a moral right and duty to defend our homeland.  If not today, the struggle will be infinitely harder tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yes, heaven forbid when the kids all listen to rock and roll and don&rsquo;t go on chaperoned dates and have piercings other than the piercings that were normal when you were a child. Do you ever wonder why you&rsquo;re often marginalized? It&rsquo;s because everyone under 40 can&rsquo;t take anything you say seriously because you just sit in your home and complain because things are not exactly the same as they were when you were growing up. It&rsquo;s like the boy who cried wolf. When it comes time to deal with a serious threat like mass immigration or the wipe-out of English in the south-west, no one listens to you because all you do is cry about dress codes and taco stands and rap music and cell-phones.</p>

		<p>Uh, if the nose ring is cultural, why would school officials object. I&rsquo;m not a fan of piercings but, hey. It&rsquo;s not like the issue is a matter of secuirty, like say, covering the face. </p>

		<p>Anonymous - we object to the SMALL things because it&rsquo;s ignoring the cumulative effects of SMALL things that leads to the big thing like ignoring illegal immigration and what it does to the nation and our culture.  Getting lax on small things always leads to giving way on bigger things.  And those of us OVER 40 remember what this country was, while you guys under 40 don&rsquo;t really realize what was lost already - through permissiveness, &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, allowing folks to &#8220;express themselves&#8221; or &#8220;find themselves&#8221; to the disgust and detriment of the general society.  Make up your mind.  You are conservative, or you are a equivocator.  It&rsquo;s the equivocators who gave away our country.  Is your nose ring MORE important that maintaining order, decorum and a reational society?</p>

		<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t she just paint a dot on her forehead?  It would have been a lot cheaper, less controversial and less painful.  She seems to have deliberately chosen the cultural option that would create the most ruckus. I guess being Indian means never having to say your sari.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just thought it would be OK to let her embrace her heritage and her culture,&#8221; said Suzannah&rsquo;s mother [&hellip;] a Mormon born in nearby Salt Lake City. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know it would be such a big deal.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think if she wants to wear a stud in her nose, more power to her.  I have seen several women wear them and as long as they are small and tasteful, they can be quite attractive.</p>
<p>Now having said that, I don&rsquo;t agree with this young lady making this an issue, especially since it&rsquo;s been the school&rsquo;s policy.  She has the rest of her life to get closer to her Indian culture and right now her main concern should be getting a good education so that she may become a productive member of society.</p>
