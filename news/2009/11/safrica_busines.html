<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20091112/AF.South.Africa.Power.Dispute/">SAfrica Business Dispute Sets Off Racism Charges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donna Bryson, Comcast News, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A struggle over how to manage South Africa&rsquo;s state-owned power company has opened debates on racism in the boardroom and political meddling in a country where politics and race remain a volatile mix.</p>
<p>Chairman Bobby Godsell and CEO Jacob Maroga were brought in recently to turn around Eskom, a utility that has been troubled for years, but they could not agree on strategy. In a statement Thursday, Eskom&rsquo;s board said both men were out, and that an acting chairman was in sole charge until a new chair and CEO were named.</p>
<p>Accusations are being made that Maroga was being pushed out because he is black. The youth wing of the ruling African National Congress party said: &#8220;The time of treating black people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as subjects, who can be fired as and when the white master wishes is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black Management Forum, an independent lobby group, said state-owned companies were becoming &#8220;slaughterhouses for the black professionals recruited to head them&#8221; because white board members did not want to give up control of the economy 15 years after the end of white political rule.</p>
<p>But the secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers, who is black, defended Godsell, saying the former mining company executive was no racist and pointing out that most of Eskom&rsquo;s board members are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Godsell resigned Monday, saying the government had not supported the board in its dispute with Maroga. Godsell said then that Maroga had offered to resign Oct. 28, then later denied resigning.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s statement said Maroga&rsquo;s &#8220;clear and unambiguous&#8221; offer to resign was accepted and stands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board recognizes that Mr. Maroga&rsquo;s resignation brings uncertainty,&#8221; the statement added, saying acting chairman Mpho Makwana &#8220;maintains that while this is a difficult time for Eskom, he is confident that the organization remains focused on the job at hand and will continue to power South Africa&rsquo;s economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In South Africa, Eskom blamed a 2008 electricity crisis on years of under-investment and rising demand. Widespread power cuts hit the industrial hub of Johannesburg and at one stage gold and platinum mines  &mdash;  the backbone of the national economy  &mdash;  had to stop production because of lack of power.</p>
<p>In a statement this week, a multiracial group of business leaders said Eskom&rsquo;s management problems needed to be quickly resolved, so that the utility could play a part in helping South Africa recover from the global recession.<br/>

		<p>That is the basic problem with hiring blacks, both here and in South Africa   &mdash;   once hired, they can never be fired.  So I can&rsquo;t blame businessmen for not wanting to hire them in the first place.</p>

		<p>The massive problem with power cuts was caused mainly because the contract to transport coal from the mines, both open-cast and deep shaft, was given to an affirmative action (black-owned) company and for the first time in SA&rsquo;s history, the coal did not get transported to the power staions.  Excuses such as when it rained the coal was too heavy to move were used, but just as the failure of a very expensive turbine shaft at a power station was caused by someone dropping a bolt from an inspection cover into the turbine blades thus damaging the in a big way when the loss was ignored and the turbine started up again, and guess what? Yes-affirmative action again where experienced and competent white technicians had been fired and replaced by blacks.<br/>
No wonder so many whites (1, 5 million now?), including us, have left South Africa, a Zimbabwe in the making.</p>
<p>Going to the FIFA Soccer World Cup next year in SA?  Make sure your insurance is very good and comprehensive with a solvent company.  We escaped in 1999, fed up with the robberies, rapes and murders.  Much more dangerous statistically, 12 times, than the USA.  The SA Govt. an ex-terrorist organisation is getting very upset at such true statemernt they are closing down SA-based web-sites that reveal the facts.</p>

		<p>Does anyone know of an objective report on how S.A. has fared since the end of aprtheid? Clearly the place is beggining to fall apart, but there is almost no reporting of that in the MSM. If blacks do in S.A. what they did in most American cities, it&rsquo;s got to be a mess, and in S.A. there is no larger white culture to bail them out.</p>

		<p>South Africa barely has its head above water now and will sink farther into the mire as the economy is turned over to blacks who have little or no business savvy or experience.  The state of every nation on the continent is directly related to how far each went in driving whites out of the government and economy.  One of the Congo countries has finally faced facts and offered long leases of farmland to whites and Asians.  Others are discussing &#8220;bringing back the white people&#8221;.  It has become manifestly clear in a quarter of a century that native African blacks are not equipped for governance, and either the truth will be dealt with brutally or the sub-Saharan region will totally implode.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The time of treating black people as subjects who can be fired at will is over&#8221;. </p>
<p>No one should be treated as a subject who can be fired at will?</p>
<p>The problem is, making this as &#8216;blacks&rsquo; (and only blacks) should never be fired, is making this into an issue of naked racism, and everyone who doesn&rsquo;t benefit (and is smart enough to know better) rejects this. It&rsquo;s natural for human beings to reject racism? Trumping race above all else, guarantees the rejection of &#8216;human rights&rsquo; in multicultural paradise - a society where rights for the citizen don&rsquo;t exist even as we give lip service, and we are obsessed, with winners and losers. Their clumsy effort to include whites, on the rarest of occasions, are so phony and fake (and the mini-endgame so disastrous), people can see right through it, and reject it not by usual habit but after consideration.</p>

		<p>Eskom is continuing to fail to deliver power. This results in &#8216;black-outs&rsquo; but as the power company is now under black control under a black government with enforced majority black shareholding, it is obvious that Zimbabwe will also suffer. Zim &#8216;bought&rsquo; huge amounts of power in the past from RSA but were unable to pay their bills and were cut off, this due to their own failed black government. Heh ho, what to do. Perhaps some of those highly qualified African-Americans from HBCU&rsquo;s would like to go and help, I&rsquo;m sure the RSA blacks would really appreciate the gesture.</p>

<p>White politicians and celebs, especially those idiotic celebs <br/>
who supported the fight against apartheid back in the 80s, <br/>
ought to be arrested for treason, considering they live in <br/>
the most segregated societies America has to offer. <b>At the <br/>
very least, they owe South Africa a huge apology for throwing <br/>
their brothers to the wolves.</b></p>

		<p>To B. J. Deller:</p>
<p>I fear most for the foreign visitors who will be going to the World Cup next year. Some of them could wind up victims of robbery and murder. I hope not. Fans from North America and Europe will be targeted, I&rsquo;m afraid. What TF was FIFA thinking, in awarding the 2010 World Cup to South Africa?</p>
<p>Wait until foreign visitors see what the end of apartheid has wrought. Americans will think they&rsquo;re in Gary, IN or Detroit. Most Europeans know South Africa only from the National Geographic and Animal Planet channels - in other words, they think the new South Africa is one giant game preserve.</p>
<p>To olewhitelady:</p>
<p>Most of the sub-Saharan nations became independent from 1960-64. In human terms, then, they&rsquo;re middle-aged. It&rsquo;s been longer than just a quarter century - next year will mark the 50th anniversary of &#8220;independence&#8221; for most of these states.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care if the Zulus and Xhosa slaughter one another in South Africa - I&rsquo;m more concerned about the visitors, especiallt the naive Europeans.</p>

		<p>Does anyone for one minute believe that law matters whatsoever with regard to this issue?  South africa, like zimbabwe before it, is a de facto black national socialist state.  What the law says doesn&rsquo;t matter&hellip;..not anymore.</p>
