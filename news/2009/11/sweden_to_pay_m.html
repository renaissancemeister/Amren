<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/23110/20091106/">Sweden to Pay More Asylum Seekers to Leave</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Landes, The Local (Stockholm), November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sweden has decided to expand a programme which gives unsuccessful asylum seekers money to voluntarily return to their homelands, at the same time as the number of refugee applications continues to drop.</p>
<p>For the past two years, citizens from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, as well as from the West Bank and Gaza who have had their asylum claims rejected have been able to apply for funds from the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) to help pay for the return trip home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve had this option for nearly two years and have been reviewing it along the way, and based on that we&rsquo;ve chosen to go ahead and open it up to more countries,&#8221; Caroline Henjered, head of the agency&rsquo;s division for asylum reception, told the TT news agency.</p>
<p>Since November 1st, an additional 20 countries have been added to the programme. Most of the countries are in Africa, but asylum seekers from parts of Russia and Kosovo can now also apply for the repatriation funds.</p>
<p>Migration authorities estimate that around 18,000 repatriation cases will be carried out in 2009. About 42 percent of cases are expected to end in voluntary return, with Iraqis making up the bulk of those willing to return on their own.</p>
<p>At the same time, about 10,000 cases will likely be handed over to police, who will then be charged with carrying out deportation orders for people who are unwilling to leave Sweden after having their applications for refugee status rejected.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 10,000 asylum seekers came to Sweden in the first six months of 2009, down from 12,000 applications during the first half of 2008, Sveriges Radio (SR) reports.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sweden still receives the highest number of asylum requests of all the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The Migration Board hopes expanding the repatriation assistance programme will increase the number of people willing to return to their homelands voluntarily and has set a goal of boosting the number of voluntary repatriation cases to 47 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re doing this because we&rsquo;ve seen that it brings results,&#8221; said Henjered.</p>
<p>According to Henjered, it&rsquo;s possible that even more countries will be added to the programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not against expanding things further in the future,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Through August, the agency has handed around 7,000 cases to the police, with about 56 percent of them thought to involve people who have decided to go underground to avoid deportation.</p>
<p>The Migration Board hopes that by allowing unsuccessful asylum seekers from more countries to apply for repatriation funds, it can also lower the number of people who go into hiding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main objective  &mdash;  and what we&rsquo;ve already seen from the evaluations we&rsquo;ve done so far  &mdash;  is to have fewer cases handed over to the police in relation to our total number of cases,&#8221; said Henjered.</p>
<p>The cost of the current repatriation assistance programme is calculated to be between 40 and 50 million kronor ($5.7 to 7.2 million).</p>
<p>However, it remains unclear how much costs may increase after more countries are added to the programme, or how the costs would compare with those incurred by having the people remain in Sweden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off the top of my head, I&rsquo;d guess that it won&rsquo;t be cheaper or more expensive,&#8221; said Henjered.<br>

		<p>&#8220;To help pay for the return trip home&rsquo; Makes about as much sense as the pothead living next door to me waaay back when. He had this mooch buddy who would come by on the bus and bum joints at all hours. The neighbor would not only give em two &#8220;to go&#8221; to keep him from hanging out all night but then started to give him a ride back home  since another bus didn`t come along for forty more minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>No surprise there.  A generous welfare system and the chance to mingle with blond nordic women motivates the Arab mind to think North.  </p>

		<p>This is insane, PAYING people who don&rsquo;t belong to return home. Here&rsquo;s what you do - drag these leeches onto a plane, fly to their home countries, put parachutes on them, open the door and give them a good shove. Return to home base and repeat. </p>

		<p>6 Tom S: You&rsquo;re right, how does an African hide in Sweden?  Eventually, sanity will require unflinching expulsion or sterilization of all non-whites, including those born to one White parent.  If you have &#8220;legals&#8221;, they will only serve to conceal the &#8220;illegals&#8221;.  The authorities should have no more trouble picking out the alien invader than sorting between dogs and cats.  </p>

		<p>On the surface, this idea looks good, but it may bomb in the long run. After all, if I was a third-world &#8216;immigrant&rsquo;, and this idea was proposed, I would gladly take the money and leave. Then I would make another run back to Sweden and claim refugee status. I&rsquo;d milk the system for all I could get, and then I&rsquo;d once again accept a cash package to leave the country. Then I could repeat it all over again, and again, and again. I&rsquo;d be a rich man!</p>

		<p>I was told the other day by a Danish friend that Denmark has just passed a law that offers US$20,000 to &ldquo;non-integrated&rdquo; immigrants having previously obtained residency status to leave Denmark and not come back. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t seem to find an English version of this news article as of yet.</p>

Matt you are right. This is no deterrent and will simply encourage more illegal immigration since there is always a cash gift even if you are apprehended. <br>
Why whites are this dumb truly amazes me.Why don&rsquo;t they learn from China. Illegal immigrants caught in China are jailed and they must provide the money to purchase a one way ticket for their own deportation back home. If they do not provide the money (usually from family back home) they remain in jail. Believe me when they finally get deported, they NEVER even dream of going back to China. Their example also serves as a warning to others!</p>

<p>Very easily. There are now whole areas full of them.</p>
<p>A ride on the Stockholm subway can look almost like New York.<br>
Sometimes, whites are the minority. Sometimes you look around and  don&rsquo;t see any other whites at all.</p>

		<p>The Swedes are descended from the mighty Vikings.  It is time for this highly intelligent and strong people to tap into those family genes.  </p>
<p>BTW, blonde is a recessive hair-color trait among Scandinavians; the dominant color is light-to-medium brown with a hint of red. </p>
