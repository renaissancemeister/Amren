<h1>Latino Group Sues to Stop State From Canceling Vehicle Registrations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randy Ludlow, Columbus Dispatch, November 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Latino group is asking a judge to prevent state officials from canceling the registrations of more than 40,000 vehicles apparently driven by undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The League of United Latin American Citizens filed the lawsuit against state officials in Franklin County Common Pleas Court this morning.</p>
<p>The legal action comes two weeks before the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles plans to revoke the potentially fraudulently obtained license plates of those who cannot provide proof of legal U.S. residency.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the state from canceling registrations effective Dec. 8, claims the move is an illegal state foray into immigration matters, which are a federal responsibility. A hearing on the requested injunction is set for Dec. 1</p>
<p>Lawyers were met with applause from a largely Latino crowd of 200 people late this morning as they provided details of the lawsuit at Downtown&rsquo;s Trinity Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dennis Muchnicki, a Dublin immigration lawyer who filed the lawsuit bankrolled by hundreds of donations from Ohio&rsquo;s Latino community, accused the state of &#8220;bureaucratic whim and caprice&#8221; that will harm thousands of families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Oct. 8, the BMV mailed 47,457 letters informing vehicle owners that their registrations would be canceled unless they provide a valid Ohio driver license or identification card or proof of a Social Security number.</p>
<p>As of last week, 2,245 people had visited BMV offices and provided proof of legal U.S. residency.</p>
<p>The state crackdown came after The Dispatch revealed that a loophole in Ohio law allowed thousands of undocumented workers to register vehicles even though many did not have valid Social Security numbers or vehicle insurance.</p>
<p>The immigrants hired &#8220;runners&#8221; with legal U.S. residency to register their cars with falsified power-of-attorney forms that did not require verification of the identity of vehicle owners. The forms only required Social Security numbers, which state officials could not verify.</p>
<p>The state enacted a policy on Aug. 24 requiring runners to provide the driver&rsquo;s license or state ID numbers or proof of Social Security numbers of people for whom they are registering vehicles.</p>

		<p><i>The lawsuit, which seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the state from canceling registrations effective Dec. 8, claims the move is an illegal state foray into immigration matters, which are a federal responsibility.</i></p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure some Federal law prohibits illegal aliens from registering cars.</p>
<p>But even if there weren&rsquo;t, the state isn&rsquo;t canceling the registrations because of immigration status per se, it&rsquo;s doing it because the illegal aliens presented fake documents to get the registration.  In other words, Ohio is pursuing the fraud angle.</p>

		<p>Very dangerous for our courts to be involved with the breakdown of law and order rather than the enforcement of our laws.  The US is not a police state.  Indeed, there is no such thing as a true police state as no state is capable of wielding such awesome power that they can force their will on people.  Instead, they must rely on the vast majority of people, not only cooperating most of the time but contributing their all most of the time.  If respect for the law is lost&hellip;..</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s taken for granted that, if you want to drive a car, you register it, insure it, get a license, obey traffic laws etc.  But why should we&hellip;.if illegals don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>What are the implications of that.</p>

		<p>Why do we continue to hear about &#8220;Latino&#8221; groups and &#8220;black&#8221; groups? Do we have any &#8220;white&#8221; groups that will stand up and say, &#8220;hold on a mintute,&#8221; what you&rsquo;re trying to do is wrong and here are the laws to prove it? Have we become such wimps that we think we&rsquo;d be stigmatized if WE were to form groups? They take care of their own, even to aiding and abetting criminals. We are so intimidated and afraid of becoming one of the many popular labels, that we keep our mouths shut and only bemoan the deteriorating state of this country. Speak up and defend this glorious land before it&rsquo;s the next third world dump.</p>

		<p>Surprise, surprise, who&rsquo;d a thunk it? Criminals who gained ilegal entry into this country, want to change the laws to fit their ilegal lifestyle? Goooleee. This will likely get passed, by Obama type judges. This country is getting the change they voted for. The big fire is getting near, let those who have ears, hear.</p>

		<p>For people who aren&rsquo;t very up on the nature of the Mexican reconquista groups, LULAC, used to be a relatively mild organization. It strictly followed the U.S. laws and never stepped out of the boundaries, like for example, supporting anything to do with illegal immigration. They were strictly for protecting the rights of legal hispanics. Not now. Now LULAC is another radical Mexican lobby, that challanges U.S. laws, even where illegal aliens are concerned.</p>

		<p>It is a complete mystery to me how any group can even conceive of filing an injunction against a lawful state authority that is executing its lawful obligation to uphold and enforce laws, rules and regulations lawfully set by duly appointed authorities.</p>
<p>It is inconceivable that such an effort will succeed.</p>
<p>But likely it will. We have truly become a nation of fools.</p>
