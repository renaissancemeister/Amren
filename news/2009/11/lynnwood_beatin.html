<h1>Lynnwood Beating Death Called &#8216;Honor Killing&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seattle Times, October 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a police statement filed Thursday in Everett District Court, 61-year-old Mehdi M. Matin says more than 20 years ago his brother uttered words about his bride-to-be so terrible the wedding was called off. Both men are from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Matin was visiting his brother Monday when he repeated the remark.</p>
<p>Matin told detectives he hit his brother in the head with a pipe until he was unconscious and then strangled him with a rope.</p>

		<p>&#8220;20 years ago his brother&#8221;&hellip;THIRTY years ago my brother and I choked each other till almost death over a Braniff stewardess that looked like a cross between Elizabeth Taylor and Helen of Troy. I ended up getting the majority of dates as well as bruises&hellip;</p>

		<p>At least the brother won&rsquo;t be collecting SSI on our dime.  Just deport the old man. I don&rsquo;t care what he did he shouldn&rsquo;t be our problem.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Matin told detectives he hit his brother in the head with a pipe until he was unconscious and then strangled him with a rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in Washington, D.C. Nancy Pelosi was declaring to all who would listen that &#8220;Diversity is our strength,&#8221; and she also remarked that guns should be banned so murders wouldn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>And when Al and Jesse heard about the rope strangulation, they called on all their rent-a-mob welfare recipients to get ready to march, but that was before anyone had a chance to tell them no blacks were involved.</p>

		<p>The more I read these stories of honor killings or attempted murders of their own children for being too Western, the more I can&rsquo;t help seeing many Muslims as primitive, demented, and infantile. </p>
<p>What can they offer the West? Was the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia/NZ not diverse enough until we have grown men trying to run down their own daughters because the girls won&rsquo;t wear burkas?</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I get a little bit of a chuckle when I read an article that tries to intimidate us into believing that Sharia law is going to take over.</p>
<p>Not so.  To all the Muslims I&rsquo;d like to inform them that the longer your people stay in contact with Western society&rsquo;s excesses the more apt they are to be corrupted by them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if it is common several years down the road to see your wives and sweethearts onstage in a nude bar, because she thinks it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Eventually Muslims will realize what a horrible error they made in relocating to the West.  But, then, it will be too late.</p>

		<p>And in another state a father has been arrested for running his daughter over with a car - on purpose and on Fox News this morning, they did call it an honor killing.</p>

		<p>Boy, I&rsquo;m glad Celler and Javits pushed their Immigration Act of 1965 through (using Dumbo Teddy K as a &#8216;sponsor&rsquo;). If they hadn&rsquo;t gotten this vital legislation passed, instead of colorful characters from Afghanistan like the men in the story above, we&rsquo;d have to put up with horrible Swedes, Italians, Irish, Poles, Welshmen, Czechs, Germans, Spaniards&hellip;</p>
