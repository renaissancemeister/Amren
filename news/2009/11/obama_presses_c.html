<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/13/AR2009111303995.html">Obama Presses Congress to Rework Immigration Laws</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, November 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration expects Congress to begin moving to overhaul the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws early next year, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Friday, adding that improved border security and a drop in migration caused by the economic downturn make such changes &#8220;far more attainable&#8221; than in 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Congress is ready to act, we will be ready to support them,&#8221; said Napolitano, President Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;point person&#8221; on immigration policy issues. &#8220;The first part of 2010, we will see legislation beginning to move,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Napolitano&rsquo;s speech, delivered at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, was aimed at Latino advocates who have expressed skepticism that Obama would fulfill a campaign pledge to push for a &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration package.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, Napolitano sought to reframe the debate from past years, saying lawmakers&rsquo; earlier demands that the government improve &#8220;enforcement first&#8221; have been met. She argued that the time to work on immigration issues is when a sluggish economy is dampening illegal migration.</p>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has built more than 600 miles of fencing and pedestrian barriers on the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, and more than doubled the ranks of the U.S. Border Patrol, to 20,000 officers, Napolitano said. Meanwhile, because of a shrinking job market and increased enforcement, Border Patrol arrests last year were less than half the 2005 level of 1.2 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are major differences that should change the immigration conversation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have gotten Congress&rsquo;s message she said. &#8220;Trust me: I know a major shift when I see one, and what I have seen makes reform far more attainable this time around.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that our economic near-depression is assuaging some illegal immigration.  If you were a Mexican, where would you rather be?  A &#8220;prosperous&#8221; Mexico, or a &#8220;depressed&#8221; America?  Nuff said.</p>

		<p>Actually, being in a recessed economy with high unemployment rates should make it a bad time to push for amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>I remember reading a survey last month in which 56% (and 65% with a family member in the US) of Mexicans thought that granting amnesty to illegal aliens in America would make it more likely that people they know would go to the USA illegally. 36% said they would still move to America if they could even with the current recession. 69% said that the primary loyalty of Mexican-Americans should be to Mexico.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the survey:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2009/10/public_opinion_1.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/10/public_opinion_1.php</a></p>
<p>Hopefully, the American people will rise up and defeat the coming amnesty like last time.</p>

		<p>I for one like it when Congress attempts an amnesty - it only galvanizes the opposition.  Each time they try, they get a little reminder of how out of touch they are with the electorate, and how we can&rsquo;t be snowed.  The closer to the &#8216;10 elections they try this, the better.  </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that amnesty could pass in this economic environment.  The fact that the subject is even being broached might serve to open the eyes of a few sheeple.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it was less than three years ago Bush was trying to push amnesty on the ground that our economy was dependent on Mexican illegals.  Doing the &#8220;jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want to do.&#8221;  (A phrase that&rsquo;s gone the way of the &#8220;ownership society&#8221;   &mdash;   remember that one?).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think anyone could be a worse liar than Bush on the issue, but I think with these statements Napolitano has done it.  As far as I know her two main achievements have been shutting down work on the &#8220;shovel ready&#8221; fence and halting workplace enforcement.  And no, immigration being halved because of the tanking economy does not count as &#8220;enforcement.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well of course Obama has to get amnesty rammed through before the next presidential election. It&rsquo;s the only way he will win another term, if millions of illegals are now given the right to vote through citizenship.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re enforcing immigration law?  Since when?  When we&rsquo;ve deported every single illegal I&rsquo;ll believe that we&rsquo;re enforcing immigration law.  Napolitano is a sick joke.  We have Obama and his pals harassing a sheriff precisely because he <i>does</i> enforce immigration law.  Congress refuses to mandate the use of e-verify to ensure that employers don&rsquo;t hire illegal aliens.</p>

I&rsquo;ve already heard one amnesty advocate on c-span say that we need to pass an amnesty now so we&rsquo;ll have a legal work force when the economy recovers.</p>

		<p>Some very important information was buried in that original article.  Notice the comment about the 2005 arrest level of 1.2 million people.</p>
<p>Now contemplate the fact that the Border Patrol is unlikely to have been able to intercept more than 25% of the people crossing into the USA - and that&rsquo;s probably a charitable assessment.  That would imply that in 2005 alone we had on the order of 3 - 5 million people illegally immigrate.</p>
<p>Yet we are still told that there are &#8220;only&#8221; 12 million illegals in the nation.  &#8220;Only&#8221; an entire Los Angeles-size city&rsquo;s worth of people.  At 2005 levels, that would represent less than 3 years worth of immigration.</p>
<p>The odds are therefore very high that the number of illegals actually living in the USA is far higher than 12 million.  The 20 - 30 million figure is probably more accurate.</p>
<p>Our government clearly has no idea how many illegals are here, and little interest in quantifying the number, much less reducing it.</p>
<p>Most depressing of all is the realization that with the stroke of his pen, Obama&rsquo;s amnesty will instantly nullify the votes of every person reading AR as well as that of their entire circle of family and friends.  The illegals will vote 90% Democrat, every time.  Their numbers dwarf the number of true conservatives and racially aware people in the nation.  Never forget folks, our worthless leaders are very aware of that last fact, and it&rsquo;s a major reason why amnesty will be offered.</p>
<p>You, your families, and all your future descendants are being deliberately marginalized and displaced.  In my book, that is high treason on the part of our elected officials.</p>

<p>Tea Partiers Brutally Beaten by Pro-Amnesty Group</p>
<p>Che Guevara supporters with a radical pro-amnesty coalition viciously attacked and bludgeoned tea party protesters at a Florida anti-illegal-immigration rally, including a 62-year-old man who was beaten and kicked in the face&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The only thing these beasts understand is brutal violence, administered immediately and with extreme prejudice  &mdash;  as they administer violence to those with whom they do not agree.  Those pretend che-worshipping revolutionaries should have been thrashed after kicking and beating a 62-year senior citizen.</p>
<p>This link from WND.com also contains a graphic video of the beating.  I googled this story and could not find one single large mainstream news outlet that bothered to report about it.  You can bet if the races were reversed, and Whites were accused of beating a senior citizen-aged immigrant or non-White it would be the lead story on the national news for weeks on end.</p>
<p>Watch it and get throughly enraged.</p>

		<p>RHG #6 is quite correct. Our present UK labour government shipped in millions of Pakistani &amp; Bangladeshi muslims, most of whom went to join others in the &#8216;muslim only&rsquo; areas of Northern England. All members of each family were granted postal ballots which were collected by the head male and handed over to their local imam for completion to ensure their preferred labour candidate was elected. There were many reports of electoral fraud which were made public at the time. Many candidates were muslim and several, including the disgraced &#8216;Justice Minister&rsquo;, were elevated into the highest positions in Government. Even Pakistani postmen were met in the street to hand over voting papers before even delivering them to individual addresses. One labour candidate in a London borough had to be &#8216;de-selected&rsquo; as muslims publicly declared they would not vote for her as she was a woman and, in any case, Jewish. Labour backed down in the face of muslim protests. By law, no one in UK is permitted to object to a candidate on the grounds of race but muslims can, and do.</p>

		<p>Everything this administration does and says is backward to commonsense.  I say this knowing that all that they say and do is for the expansion of the federal government and increasing the number of people beholding to the Democrat party.</p>
<p>I guess I do not understand things the way the elites do.  I actually thought that with the number of US citizens unemployed that now would be the time to increase enforcement so that there are fewer illegals competing with US citizens and that every job an illegal is taken out of a US citizen could compete to get.</p>
<p>I would hope people see through this farce in the nest election cycle.</p>

		<p>The Dems want illegal immigration.  That will give them a permanent majority in Congress, as well as the Presidency. Business Repuglicans want illegal immigration for cheap labor, so they can get richer.  The biggest losers will be white males, who will suffer even more under affirmative action.  And if we legalize 20 million, and each one can sponsor 3 close relatives, you are talking about a total influx of 80 million mostly uneducated people.  Try to imagine that!  The USA will be shot.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the immigration fight. We closed the switchboard down once&hellip;let&rsquo;s do it again. Let&rsquo;s write, fax, phone and do everything possible not only to get the insanity stopped but to send the illegals packing. They&rsquo;d leave if E-verify were enforced, birthright citizenship revoked and all benefits stopped. Then we wouldn&rsquo;t have to hear the idiots in DC whine about not being able to depert 12 million. Heck, 20 million would self-deport if the handouts dried up.</p>
