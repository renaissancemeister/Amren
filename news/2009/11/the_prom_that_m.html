<h1><a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/725250">The Prom That Made History</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Keung, Toronto Star, November 13. 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 1960s, Paul Saltzman went to Mississippi and was thrown in jail for his voter-registration activities.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Oakville filmmaker went back to the Deep South state  &mdash;  and was shocked to find that the high school in Charleston still held separate proms for its black and white students.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, he [Paul Saltzman] was told Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman, who has roots in the area, had offered to pay for an integrated prom at Charleston High School a decade earlier. His offer was rejected.</p>
<p>So in 2007, Saltzman contacted Freeman to find out if the offer still stood. It did, so Saltzman set about to bring about an integrated prom, while recording the process. The result is an 89-minute film titled Prom Night in Mississippi.</p>
<p>The documentary opens Friday in Toronto and has a special showing at 7:30 p.m. at the Varsity theatres with Freeman in attendance. The event will raise funds for anti-racism education kits, including a DVD of the movie, to be sent to schools in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evil lives in shade. We need to shed a light on it and talk about it,&#8221; Saltzman says of his movie. &#8220;You got to say, &#8216;That&rsquo;s not okay.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>His film begins with Freeman meeting Charleston educators and addressing students to propose a first mixed prom at a school long since integrated in the classrooms.</p>
<p>It records the tensions in the Delta town of about 2,200 people, two-thirds black, leading up to the big day on April 19, 2008, when an otherwise uneventful teen social makes history.</p>
<p>The filmmaker had to overcome local skepticism. &#8220;Officials were worried that we were to shame them,&#8221; says Saltzman, a veteran of television and movies who had taken a 15-year hiatus from filmmaking before Prom Night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I assured them of one thing: I have no axe to grind. I just want to explain how they think and feel, and not put any spin on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results are compelling. There&rsquo;s a young couple (she&rsquo;s white, he&rsquo;s black) who talk about defying their families to attend the dance together, getting applause from every guest. There&rsquo;s the white teen who will only talk to the camera in silhouette as he criticizes his parents&rsquo; racist attitudes.</p>
<p>Saltzman and his wife, co-producer Patricia Aquino, lived in Charleston for five months to gain the community&rsquo;s trust and grasp the tradition of the separate proms.</p>
<p>Most students favoured one prom for all; it was their parents, especially whites, who backed the two-prom tradition. Some of them organized a white-only prom for their kids and pressured them to ignore the integrated dance held later.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took the attitude that things had been much better before,&#8221; Saltzman says. &#8220;There used to be slavery, night riders and the Ku Klux Klan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five Oakville families are sponsoring the special screening, among them Chris Invidiata, who knows firsthand how harmful systemic prejudice can be. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was interned by Canada when Italy lined up with Germany during World War II. He took his own life while in detention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prom Night is a victory for the kids,&#8221; Invidiata said. &#8220;The story began when the students at Charleston initiated the &#8216;Yes&rsquo; decision. The barrier had to be broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saltzman has been working hard to spread that message to youth. His film has already been screened at 50 schools, including Earl Haig Secondary School, St. Andrew&rsquo;s College and Lester B. Pearson Collegiate, here and in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prom Night was screened at Lester B. Pearson during the Hot Docs (festival) in Toronto,&#8221; Saltzman says. &#8220;I got an email from the teacher later, telling me that all 23 students in the class stood up at the end to give a standing ovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in Mississippi? This year Saltzman and Aquino went back and were happy to learn the school had held a second mixed prom, although once again there was also a whites-only version.<br>

<p>And will this be the end of it?</p>
<p>They have their mixed prom. Will they now leave whites alone to have their own?</p>
<p>Since they haven&rsquo;t achieved their goals through manipulating emotions, I&rsquo;ll bet someone is going to file a discrimination complaint against the organizers of the white prom in the next few years.</p>

		<p>In other words, the &#8220;integrated&#8221; prom is merely a circumlocution for the &#8220;black&#8221; prom, plus a few white girls running with blacks.  </p>

		<p>If the parents are the ones primarily in favor of separate proms, maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been around the block a few times and know something their brainwashed, dumbed-down kids don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like the black male/white female pair mentioned in the article just seem to be intent on dishonoring their parents. Sadly, the stupid white girl will probably learn the hard way that her parents really know more about life than she does. Nor does the kid who insists on having his face shown in silhouette (with voice distortion also, I presume?) impress me in the least. </p>
<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s the brazen hypocrisy of it all. Despite the constant blathering about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; that&rsquo;s actually the last thing liberals like Saltzman really want. Out of all the towns in America, why can&rsquo;t there be one where those who want to socialize with others of their own kind do so, instead of being forced into an artifical conformity?</p>

		<p>And yet non-whites and black especially separate themselves at every opportunity, in every way, and that&rsquo;s something promoted as enlightenment, even celebrated, and of course, always paid for. Forget about workplaces and schools, there are entire neighborhoods now that are no-go areas for whites. Soon entire cities. </p>

		<p>And whose music and entertainment will be featured at the &#8216;mixed prom&rsquo;? I&rsquo;m sure this documentary filmmaker could have found more than one kid who didn&rsquo;t want their prom ruined by rap, hip-hop and post-prom gang rapes if he had wanted to.</p>

		<p>These film producers and most of the audience for that matter have NO clue. The Blacks and Whites  have different dance and musical tastes and their own culture. Blacks often  prefer their own culture and entertainment and music when it comes to socializing and  do not want to mix with Whites. Also, in southern small towns, despite the media spin to sell tickets, there is no tension, they are just boring places where Whites and Blacks all know each other, get along and go about their business. </p>

		<p>There have been a number of articles about these seperate black and White proms happening around the country lately. <br>
In every case I&rsquo;ve read about, it turns out that there is the &#8220;normal&#8221; prom hosted by the school that all students are invited to attend, and there is also a seperate &#8220;Black Prom&#8221;  demanded by Blacks that is for Blacks only (also hosted by the school).</p>
<p>I seem to remember an article here on AmRen where this happened and some White students decided to host thier own additional &#8220;White Prom&#8221; off campus and at thier own expense&hellip; that was also open to Blacks.<br>
It still caused a &#8220;White racism&#8221; rumpus in the media.</p>
<p>So, it seems Blacks may demand (and receive) thier own seperate Proms but Whites are chastised for wanting thier own &#8220;White Prom&#8221; even when they pay for it themselves and make it open to Blacks.<br>
That is the Black race&rsquo;s idea of &#8220;social justice&#8221; in a nut-shell!<br>

		<p>It would be interesting to learn what the average opinion of the young whites in that town are on blacks.  Two people out of around seven hundred and thirty-three(who knows how many of those are minors) isn&rsquo;t exactly representative.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a young couple (she&rsquo;s white, he&rsquo;s black) who talk about defying their families to attend the dance together&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, a fling likely based entirely on teenage rebellion against one&rsquo;s parents.  Those always end so, so well.</p>

		<p>I guess this is the best place to insert this bit I found online today as I was researching a consumer complaints site.  In Houston, Texas, there is a 24 Hour Fitness, apparently the best one there, that apparently does not allow Whites - unless they are female.  They harass white men until they quit the club.</p>
<p>Will some Amren Poster in Houston look into this for us?</p>

		<p>Mr. Saltzman is nothing more than a modern day &#8220;Freedom Rider.&#8221;  A carpetbagger who left the comforts of home to stick his nose into an issue that is none of his business.  He and his wife lived in Charleston for 5 months to gain the townspeoples trust.  Indoctrination of young kids and openly advising them to disobey their so-called &#8220;racist&#8221; parents.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you what my Dad would have told Mr. Saltzman, it&rsquo;s way to verbally graphic for this website.  Foremost he would have told Mr. Saltzman to mind his own business.</p>

		<p>Mr. Saltzman may have found high schoolers who are leaning towards a all inclusive prom, but I can say from past experience when my children were in high school and attended their proms, the first thing I heard from them and many of their friends was they felt excluded.  In a high school, where the student population is probably 90% white and 10% black, hispanic and other, the prom was dominated by blacks and rap music.  </p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the article state that, even before the newly formed integrated prom, there was an integrated one held after the racially separate ones?<br>
The entire film project is a tempest in a teapot, created just to make money.  My guess is that no one, black or white, would be physically barred from attending either one of these dances.  From what I understand, there are numerous similar functions around the country, all initiated by blacks.  Once they have created their own prom (which is usually if not always in addition to an &#8220;official&#8221; prom) then whites  &mdash;  left out of the black dance  &mdash;  can hold their own.</p>

From Wikipedia&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
Delta, Mississippi, where the film was shot: </p>
<p>White: 39% <br>
Black: 60%</p>
<p><br>
Oakville, Ontario, where the crusading prom-night filmmakers live:</p>
<p>White: 81%<br>
Black: 2%</p>
<p><br>
That last one is NOT a typo. Oakville, the 165,000-population &#8220;bedroom community&#8221; outside of Toronto that these brave, &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; filmmakers call home is only TWO PERCENT BLACK. </p>
<p>And as soon as their filming was finished, these 21st Century Digital Video Freedom Riders hot-footed it out of the 60% Black town and cocooned themselves back in the safety and sanity of their 2% Black town   &mdash;   a place with so few Africans that nobody would even notice if the local prom was integrated or not. </p>
<p>Can such hypocrites even be taken seriously?</p>

		<p>     Saltzman is one of the enemy. He represents the phony media. The phony media seeks to brainwash our young. From this article, it looks like they have succeeded. Saltzman will of course, rail at vestiges of seperation in the South. This is done to weaken and marginalize one of the last bastion of americanism. Does he also rail against the whiteness of Manhattan and the exodus of blacks from that island, especially Harlem. Of course he does not. You see the whites are of a particular type-favorable to him. He is a miserable rabble rouser and agent-provacateur who is a hypocrite to boot.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know the filmmaker&rsquo;s particulars but Oakville is close to Toronto. For many whites it is a second stage region for white flight. Fleeing the diversity of Toronto many whites moved outside the city, then as diversity followed whites moved again to places like Oakville. Maybe he has a good reason for living there but Oakville is not a filmmaking center. Anyway, I think he is being rude to stick his nose in other people&rsquo;s affairs. If he wants to look for racism he can find plenty in Canada. If he wanted to set an example he could move to some of the high diversity districts of Toronto. Let him live with the benefits of integration before preaching to others. </p>

		<p>Just a little background here&hellip;</p>
<p>Only the poorest of the poor whites send their children to public schools in the Mississippi (or Arkansas or Louisiana) Delta.  It&rsquo;s been that way since the late sixties.  If you can&rsquo;t afford private schools (farming long ago ceased to be reliably profitable), you move away (generally far, far, away&hellip;like Montana), or you don&rsquo;t have kids.</p>
<p>Several of my male cousins who loved farming had themselves sterilized long before they were even engaged.  That way, no redneck girl could trap them by getting knocked-up.  Private schooling costs more than most colleges, and children are, for Delta people, a luxury reserved for only the well-to-do.  It is absolutely unthinkable, in the Delta, to send your children to public schools.</p>
<p>That only hints at the desperate situation for whites in the Delta.  Whites drive to Jackson for medical care, because they are afraid of Delta hospitals.  Greenville, once the most sophisticated town this side of Connecticut, has devolved, Capetown-style, into a third-world nightmare.  And small towns like Charleston, while more peaceful than Mississippi cities, have taken on a surreal atmosphere.</p>
<p>So if you view this film, or parts thereof, be aware that the whites portrayed are the absolute dregs.  Most Delta whites, including Jews, look like L.L. Bean models, and speak a Southern version of New England Brahmin.  They are racially and culturally distinct from the whites you will see in the &#8216;film&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Mr. Saltzman says: &#8220;&ldquo;You got to say, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not okay.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since when? And who are you to judge, Mr. Saltzman? A prom is a social, not a legal event. When I last checked, freedom of association (and conversely, freedom of non-association) is Constitutionally upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>When Americans become legally barred from privately associating with whom they wish, individual liberty - the entire constitutional purpose of our founders - dies in this country. </p>

<p>There is another option for them, if they&rsquo;re in certain areas of the Delta or near-Delta.  After the 1954 Black Monday pronouncement from On High, and after the Citizens Councils became established, some leaders started private schools, so that non-rich whites could have a way out.  They still exist to this day, and the almost the sole raison d&rsquo;etre for many Council of Conservative Citizens chapters in MS is to raise money for the schools.</p>

(Gotta get those golldarned rednecks integrated!  Gotta go back again and make SURE they are!!)  Meanwhile, he lives snugly in Canada, in a white suburb of Toronto, far from the chaos he spreads.  </p>

		<p>Integration is a failed social experiment that has borne out what our founding fathers said all along: that the two races cannot co-exist equally. After decades of trying, billions spent on aff-action programs, forced busing, quotas, set-asides, racial preferences in hiring, promotion, etc., peaceful assimilation has failed. Despite the best intentions of whites, it will never scucceed.<br>
It&rsquo;s time to move on to Phase II.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a young couple (she&rsquo;s white, he&rsquo;s black) who talk about defying their families to attend the dance together&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why mention the details?  In my experience about 90% of mixed race couples have the  female as the lighter partner.</p>
<p>Is there a compelling reason here for wanting to &#8216;lighten up&rsquo; your children, or is it a case of a white female being regarded as a &#8216;trophy wife&rsquo; by blacks?</p>
<p>And what does this have to say about the black man&rsquo;s regard for females darker than himself?  Is this not the new discrimination   &mdash;   against black females?</p>

		<p>Oh boy!  I want my anti-racism education kit!  Sounds like this Paul Saltzman is a troublemaker that likes to keep the pot stirred between the blacks and whites so he can make money off of it while he lives safe somewhere else (Canada).  As one poster already said &#8220;I saw part of the movie on HBO&#8221; well I dropped HBO about 10 years ago when I realized their ant-white left wing propaganda agenda and I hope many more do the same. Getting hit in the old pocket-book and bad ratings does real damage. Hopefully Paul SaltZman will wind up being a bag-boy at the local supermarket after his anti-white racist hate movie fails.                    </p>

		<p>Mr. Saltzman reminds me of the rabble-rousers that infected the south with the &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; of the day.  How would anyone feel if outsiders came in to your town and started trouble over so-called &#8220;civil rights?<br>
I am reminded of the woman from Detroit (Viola Liuzzo) who went down south (herself) to ride with black &#8220;freedom riders&#8221; at night.  She (and her fellow riders) were killed.  There was such an uproar; it made the papers for weeks.  Although I was only 12 years old at the time, I could see through the media hype and asked important questions.  As she had a husband and family in Detroit, what business did she have going down there (herself) to cause trouble (and to end up getting herself killed)?<br>
It is also well known that federal agents (fbi and others) orchestrated violence (and entrapped) many of the people who opposed the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement, encouraged  them to commit violent incidents that ocurred during the so-called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era.</p>

		<p>More important is who give guys like Saltzman their marching orders - and why are guys like him ALWAYS able to secure funding for their activities? That&rsquo;s what needs to be addressed. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t mean this as a troll, but is this site all about restoring American greatness? Or is it about (not so subtly) blaming America&rsquo;s decline on blacks?</p>
<p>The most horrible disservice ever perpetrated against blacks was even worse than slavery. It was LBJ&rsquo;s Great Society, and the poisonously divisive idea of &#8220;black culture.&#8221; Black families stayed strong in the face of Jim Crow, but dissolved into illiteracy, illegitimacy, and the glorification of thuggish criminality once the Government started defining blacks to be less able to cope with life without help than whites, and handing out welfare on that basis. </p>
<p>And black &#8220;leadership&#8221; in the guise of Farrakhan, Sharpton, et al continue to keep blacks in the gutter by insisting on a &#8220;black culture&#8221; distinct from the mainstream. Because Obama speaks grammatical standard English, they said he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;authentically&#8221; black. If a black kid studies and gets A&rsquo;s in school, he hopes his friends never find out or they&rsquo;ll rip on him for &#8220;acting white.&#8221; </p>
<p>Racism is poisonous no matter which way the arrow happens to point. Black Proms, as much as White Proms, only prove that racists of all colors are still working hard to prevent an American Renaissance.</p>

Only if they understand the reason why. Otherwise, the &#8220;message&#8221; is lost.  And even then, that&rsquo;s assuming that they are solely out to make a buck and have no further interest beyond money.  But the message will be wasted on them if they are committed zealots out to promote some social cause   &mdash;   which many or most  are. </p>
<p>Look at all of the Norman Lear/David Spielberg programs: they were clever propaganda disguised in the form of entertainment. No amount of threats (to withhold your money) would have gotten them to change their tune. It was central to everything they did.  It was the purpose.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oakville, Ontario, where the crusading prom-night filmmakers live:White: 81%<br>

<p>I have always found that the people who push diversity almost always live in the least diverse areas. When looking at major media people in the USA who push multiculturalism, most all of them were found to live in neighborhoods or gated properties that were 90% White or more. Their motto seems to be do as I say, not as I do.</p>

		<p>The public schools of the deep south have spring foot ball practice, 55% kids on free lunch, and test scores that never better ANY non-slave state. Proms should be called off unless held in the school gym. Kids who will never have squat except prison sentences are given limo rides and trips to sex lairs. If the board wanted to be coor blind it would call all them off.A deep south southern black high school graduate ranks dead even with a kid from a rural New York class of 6th graders. If I was a black father busting my hump to feed my kids, working two jobs, keeping them drug free, I would be demanding viloence free hallways and a zero tolerance for thuggery rather than a racially diverst hedonistic freak out.<br>
