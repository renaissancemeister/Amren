<h1><a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=338913&amp;src=109">A Decade After Decatur Fracas, Racial Gap in School Discipline Widens</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Herald (Chicago), November 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the decade since mass protests over the punishment of six black students in Decatur, the state&rsquo;s racial gap in discipline has split wide open. It&rsquo;s such a gaping hole that now more than half of all Illinois children suspended from public schools are black, even though they represent less than one-fifth of the enrollment, according to an Associated Press analysis.</p>
<p>Expulsions also have disproportionately hit blacks, worrying education experts and state lawmakers about the effect of so many minority students missing classroom time.</p>
<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson fixed the nation&rsquo;s attention on the disparity when he led protests in November 1999 over two-year expulsions of six Eisenhower High School students for brawling in the bleachers at a football game. Joined by thousands of people who marched the streets of Decatur, the civil rights leader questioned whether discipline policies were fair to all students.</p>
<p>The AP analysis of state discipline records shows the racial divide has only worsened since then, from Chicago&rsquo;s troubled schools to rural areas with few minority students:</p>
<p>o Suspensions of black students have escalated by 75&nbsp;percent since 1999, while those of white students have dropped more than 5&nbsp;percent.</p>
<p>o When it comes to the more serious punishment of expulsion, white students are kicked out 16&nbsp;percent more often than a decade ago, but black students are expelled 56&nbsp;percent more often.</p>
<p>o Whites make up nearly three-fifths of public school enrollment, yet in the most recent data, they account for one-third or fewer of both suspensions and expulsions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic suspensions are up too, but so is Illinois&rsquo; Hispanic population. Latino students now slightly outnumber blacks with 20&nbsp;percent of school enrollment, but account for just over 17&nbsp;percent of all suspensions in the latest data, compared to 51.3&nbsp;percent for blacks.</p>
<p>Experts see many factors at work: cultural differences between students and teachers, poverty, academic achievement, problems with classroom management and teacher training. They also see the possibility of racial bias in the way students are treated.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot more going on than poverty and the characteristics of kids,&#8221; said Russell Skiba, an Indiana University researcher who studies school discipline.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the largely black and Latino Chicago Public Schools, for example, suspensions for those groups jumped more than 150&nbsp;percent in a decade; white suspensions were up 44&nbsp;percent.</p>
<p>In the suburban counties surrounding Chicago, white suspensions fell while black ousters soared 94&nbsp;percent. White suspensions fell in downstate schools too, while black suspensions increased 37&nbsp;percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Skiba said a predominantly white teaching corps  &mdash;  85&nbsp;percent in Illinois, compared to 9&nbsp;percent black  &mdash;  may be culturally mismatched with minority students. White teachers without proper training, he said, can misinterpret student actions that aren&rsquo;t meant to be disruptive or threatening.</p>
<p>He has found little difference in the numbers of whites and blacks suspended for fighting, but punishment for &#8220;noncompliance&#8221; and &#8220;defiance&#8221; overwhelmingly is doled out to blacks, a more subjective transgression that might mean there&rsquo;s a cultural misunderstanding between a teacher and a student.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And one recent study shows the complexity of the issue. University of Georgia professor Jeffrey Jordan and a colleague found that black teachers in a school district near Atlanta recommended discipline for black kids in larger proportions than white teachers.</p>

								<h2>Jesse&rsquo;s Riot Act</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Karina Rollins, FrontPage Magazine, November 18, 1999</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>NEWS REPORTS describe a &#8220;fight&#8221; on September 17 between students of two high schools at a football game in Decatur, Ill. &#8220;Fight&#8221; conjures up images of shoves leading to punches among two, three, maybe four people. More than four pairs of flying fists is a brawl. About ten hooligans participated in the Decatur incident, and their &#8220;fight&#8221; was by no means restricted to them alone. Other spectators had to scramble out of their way, an older man and woman were nearly knocked over, and another couple was almost pushed off the stands. The rampage lasted for ten minutes, and officials had to interrupt the game. The video footage looks like a melee from a British soccer match  &mdash;  and shows the riot for what it was.</p>
<p>The school board suspended six of the teens, all public-high-school students, for two years, and prosecutors filed felony charges against them. Enter the Reverend Jesse Jackson. With scores of racial agitators and sympathetic newsmen in tow, Jackson has turned the &#8220;Decatur Six&#8221; into the silliest cause since Mumia Abu Jamal. He makes no effort to disprove the students&rsquo; guilt, nor does he even challenge the idea of stringent policies against school violence. His suggestion seems to be that in this case, the rules are not only unfair, but racist. All six expelled students are black.</p>
<p>Still, he insists that Decatur is in no way a racial issue, just one of fairness. Of course. So how is a school board&rsquo;s implementing its zero-violence policy against violent goons unfair? Mainly, it seems, because the predominantly white board enforced its rules against blacks. Jackson also complains that Decatur schools have suspended disproportionate numbers of blacks in the past, although he does not consider whether those punishments might have been justified.</p>
<p>In an amazing redefinition of reality, the Reverend calls the riot &#8220;a schoolyard fight&#8221; and &#8220;something silly like children do.&#8221; He harps on the irrelevant fact that one of the expelled boys is an honor student, but conveniently ignores that three of the others are freshmen for the fourth time, and that most of them have a long track record of skipping school. (With a straight face, Jackson bemoans the loss of education the Decatur thugs will suffer as a result of their punishment.) He explains why the out-of-control brawl was so benign: &#8220;No blood, no injuries, no guns.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Like other civil-rights radicals, Jackson sees black crime as the result of some sort of white conspiracy. When blacks break the law, the argument goes, a racist society has driven them to it. But that mentality is patronizing to blacks; it assumes that they are not in control of their own actions. &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t call a black thug a thug, you&rsquo;re a racist,&#8221; Tamar Jacoby reminds herself in <cite>Someone Else&rsquo;s House,</cite> her heartfelt plea to Americans to close the still-existing separation of white and black life in America. By extension, if Jackson can&rsquo;t call a black rioter a rioter, he&rsquo;s a racist. For the Reverend, no issue involving blacks can ever be taken at face value. There is always an underlying agenda, and it&rsquo;s always white racism.</p>
<p>{snip} Claiming to fight racial oppression in the Nineties, Jackson creates it where it does not exist. But many blacks have bought into his absurdity. A throng of protesters who came for Jackson&rsquo;s Decatur rally last Sunday actually sang &#8220;We Shall Overcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I can see, it seems like they don&rsquo;t care about black kids,&#8221; said one participant in a Jackson rally after the county prosecutor filed criminal charges against the students. That accusation would be better leveled against Jesse Jackson. The student bodies at Decatur public schools are nearly 40 percent black. Jackson would rather that law-abiding minorities pay the price of going to school with dangerous classmates than punish the offenders in any serious way.</p>

		<p>The Illinois State Senate is going to commission a study to see what the reason for the suspension and expulsion racial gap can be.</p>
<p>Let me save them some time and money:  Black students behave more badly.  And in this insane state, where the visage of Adolph Lenin, the great egalitarian reprobate appears on everything, the racial equality-loving public schools do everything they can to keep from suspending or expelling a black student.  And they&rsquo;re still much more likely to be suspended or expelled.  If the system were truly fair, more blacks would be suspended or expelled even more often.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some offenses, like carrying a gun to school, and a few others, bring automatic expulsion.  Blacks tend to those kind of offenses.</p>

		<p>Teachers culturally mismatched with minority students?  I&rsquo;ve heard that before.  Decades ago in Flint, MI the poor performance of black students was blamed on the white teachers not being able to relate to black students.  After black teachers were hired and black students continued to do poorly black parents cried racism, saying that their kids were being taught by poorly trained black teachers.  Black parents began demanding that their children be taught by white teachers. </p>

		<p>So much energy and resources wasted over nothing.  Selective breeding would greatly help the black race.  Perhaps then they can accomplish something with their lives.  The &#8220;liberals&#8221; should be forced to help these people with their own money and time.</p>

		<p>Those thugs attacked others in the stands in a deliberate manner, using martial arts moves in a way to harm or kill, and doing so heedless of the surroundings. Colored kids attacking other colored kids with a vengeance. Pushing others in the stands out of the way, endangering bystanders, all without any provocation.</p>
<p>Right, they always call it a &#8220;brawl&#8221;, a &#8220;fight&#8221;, &#8220;fisticuffs&#8221;, etc. It was none of that. Mob action with what appears to be intent to kill.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re willing to say black students are being suspended (out of thin air perhaps - like a UFO abduction in close encounters) on a daily basis more often than whites students, yet these same journalists and teachers are unwilling to say black students are committing more crimes and infractions. </p>

		<p>Just be a little patient, folks. In the future they might prove with hard facts that whites are more likely to be suspended.</p>
<p>How? Easy. For every suspended black simply suspend the two<br>

		<p>Let me add to #4&rsquo;s advice:  Let them add their own sperm and/or ova to the crusade.  See how many liberal elitists will go along with that!  <br>
This, like the first Breaking News item of today, is just another attempt to excuse black/Hispanic failure.  Here, it&rsquo;s the failure to behave properly instead of learn properly.  Of course, if a school system attempted to put black teachers only with black students, the former would howl in protest, and Jackson/Sharpton would arrive promptly!</p>

		<p>There is no need to invoke psychology, social justice, segregation or discrimination in these figures. There is simply need to look at them dispassionately.</p>
<p>Having done that, one obvious conclusion jumps out. In 9 years the expulsions of whites went down whilst that of blacks and hispanics went up. Expulsion are a form of punishment and to some classes of society it is also a stigma. The obvious conclusion to be drawn from these figure is that certain people learn from punishment and others do not. As in certain classes in England where an ASBO is considered a badge of honour, it appears the same is true of exclusions. Therefore exclusions do not work. The schools have to come up with a different system of punishment that first and foremost denies any status to the offender. I can not only do that, but save the schools money in the bargain. All offenders are sentenced to janitorial duty - cleaning the washrooms. Since most offenders are also bullies, I would hate to have to walk into any of the washrooms to which the worst are sentenced. Of course it will require an overseer who has the authority and is provided with the muscle to lock  the kid into the washroom and not let him out until is is spotless, I know some teachers and most would volunteer.</p>

		<p>They seem to never mention Asians, but they do their best be anti-white.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; whatever it is has certainly in part become a superstition weilded by the elite to agitate the low IQ subset of the Left against whites in general.

		<p>Always constant excuses for bad behavior.  Both of my parents were World War Two generation, and went through public high schools in New York City.  No one back then made any excuses for the fact that they were from poor families.  My father by the way, was Jewish, in a time when anti-semitism was much more prevelent than today.  Just utterly ridicilous that bleeding heart liberals keep making excuses for minorities&rsquo; bad behavior. But, with all this constantly harping about bad behaior and excuse gerrymandering, a few good things are coming out it.I&rsquo;ve been noticing that whites of my generation (generation X), along with  the boomers, are really beginning to get fed up with the nonstop pathological behavior of minorities in all areas of life.</p>

		<p>QD reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It should be noted that some offenses, like carrying a gun to school, and a few others, bring automatic expulsion. Blacks tend to those kind of offenses&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I know of many instances where this was covered up.</p>
<p>You are quite right that schools are under tremendous pressure not to suspend or expel black (and more recently) hispanic students.  Expulsion is a very long, drawn-out process that involves countless hostile meetings, excruciating documentation, endless forms that must be filed.  It is extremely difficult to expel any student these days  &mdash;  non-White students have all the rights and organizations to back them. </p>
<p>Even suspension has become exceedingly difficult, involving antagonistic parent conferences where the parent won&rsquo;t hesitate to call YOU, the teacher, a racist.  Few administrators will take your side, especially if you, the teacher, are White and the student and family non-White.  The administrator does not want to answer to the central office as to why blacks as being suspended or up for expulsion  &mdash;  better to shut-up the teacher, move the kid to other classrooms, anything to keep the black suspension/expulsion rate low.  </p>
<p>To the komissars in the main office, any number of black suspensions proves existing White racism in the school. </p>
<p>From the first article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Skiba said a predominantly white teaching corps &mdash; 85 percent in Illinois, compared to 9 percent black &mdash; may be culturally mismatched with minority students. White teachers without proper training, he said, can misinterpret student actions that aren&rsquo;t meant to be disruptive or threatening&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How would he explain &#8221; that black teachers in a school district near Atlanta recommended discipline for black kids in larger proportions than white teachers.&#8221;?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s right!  After 40 years of multi-culti, extensive mandated teacher training, and pounding into White teachers&rsquo; heads that &#8216;We Are All Exactly the Same!&rsquo; nothing has worked.  Therefore, let&rsquo;s agree to separate, the sooner the better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the ONLY answer possible is separation  &mdash;  and this includes Whites allowed to open White Heritage schools as well.  Maybe the PLF would be willing to file the necessary lawsuits, because it will take a lot of litigation for Whites to separate  &mdash;  litigation we may never win.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Expulsions also have disproportionately hit blacks, worrying education experts and state lawmakers about the effect of so many minority students missing classroom time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yes. When black thugs are in class, or wandering the halls of the school without passes or permission, they really are absorbing &#8220;classroom time&#8221;. Like drawing pornagraphic images on the desks, yelling n  &mdash;  - incessently, or threatening teachers and the minority of motivated students.</p>

		<p>It stands to reason that those students causing the most trouble are the ones most likely to get suspended or expelled.  When I went to school that was 50% black, the most evil kids there were all black.  Some were so violent and racist that it should be a crime for any parent to willingly send their child to one of these awful public schools. </p>

		<p>The black and latino expulsion increase telegraphs a much larger problem - an increase in criminal street gangs and crime in Chicago within a very few years.</p>
<p>Without an education, and no concept whatsoever of respect for others in our society, let alone working for a living, what else do most dropouts devolve into except souless gang thugs?</p>
<p>As this gang thug population increases, productive citizens flee the city and the state - anyone detect a pattern here?</p>
<p>In a few more years Chicago will sink beneath the criminal and mutate into another sickening Detroit.</p>
<p>All of this because the people running education policy have foolishly propagandized themselves into completely forbidding empirical common sense.</p>
