			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Verkaik, Independent (London), November 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of children trafficked to Britain each year are being failed by social workers, teachers and doctors, it is claimed today in a report which uncovers the hidden misery of the international trade in young labour.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that when trafficked children try to escape from imprisonment in Britain, their cries for help are ignored or negligently handled by UK agencies. The report, by the Children&rsquo;s Society charity, found that those who managed to escape their captors were often returned to domestic imprisonment, where they were forced to work as prostitutes in brothels or as slaves in British homes. Children who were allowed to leave their guardian&rsquo;s home were usually too frightened to disclose what was happening to them.</p>
<p>One young girl trafficked to Britain was groomed and sexually exploited while in the care of children&rsquo;s services. She did not know that what was happening was illegal, or that it was considered abuse.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) is aware of 325 children from 52 countries who may have been trafficked in 2008. But the Children&rsquo;s Society, which looked closely at 46 cases in the UK, said these figures did not account for young people who feel they have no choice but to keep their ordeals a secret.</p>
<p>More than half of the young people in these initial case studies had attended school while in Britain, but when they asked for support from various agencies, the frontline workers did not know how to help or refer them. The charity said that some who had reported their situation found frontline workers unwilling to help, disbelieving the seriousness of their claims or unaware of where to refer them.</p>
<p>Even when a child is identified as being at risk of exploitation and taken into care, they still face kidnapping by traffickers. In May this year, it was discovered that 77 children had gone missing from a single children&rsquo;s home near Heathrow since March 2006. It is estimated that 1.2 million children worldwide are trafficked each year, in a trade worth £16bn annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst recent media reports have claimed that the problem of trafficking has been overstated, this new research brings into startling perspective the very real problems faced by children separated from their carers and exploited and mistreated by those responsible for them in the UK,&#8221; said the authors of the report.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s disturbing findings will add to growing pressure on the Government to introduce a law making domestic servitude and forced labour an offence in the UK for the first time. Last week, ministers backed down and dropped opposition to a new anti-slavery offence punishable by 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment. Some of the children living on the streets of the world&rsquo;s poorest cities are picked up by criminal gangs before being sold on to traffickers who take them to countries including Britain. Others are sold to traffickers by their parents. The most common countries of origin are China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Afghanistan and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Lisa Nandy, policy adviser for the Children&rsquo;s Society, said: &#8220;Whilst sexual exploitation may be the most high-profile form of trafficking, young people can be, and have been, exploited in a number of different ways, including forced labour and domestic servitude. All of these children are extremely vulnerable, and the agencies need to work together to identify and support these victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 46 children&rsquo;s journeys to Britain varied greatly but most came from Asia and Africa. Many of them arrived by plane and either with the person they would be living with, a family member or a trafficker. Some entered undetected on lorries or trucks and one reported coming by boat.</p>
<p>Some came to join family members in the UK, but in nearly every case the children were brought into the country on other people&rsquo;s passports and by people claiming to be their parents.</p>
<p>One girl was told to wear boy&rsquo;s clothes and memorise a new identity. She said she &#8220;messed up&#8221; her answers to the immigration official who questioned her, but this was not picked up and she ended up imprisoned in a British home.</p>
<p><b>From Africa to slavery: &#8216;They shouted at me, hit me and beat me&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>*Anna, 16, was brought to Britain from Africa by a woman who told her mother she would find her daughter a good home and a better life in London.</p>
<p>She was one of six women and children on the flight who were being escorted by the woman. On arrival in the UK, the girls were taken to a van and driven around the city, being dropped off at various locations.</p>
<p>A woman who was to be Anna&rsquo;s guardian paid the trafficker some money and Anna was handed over to her new mistress. She lived with a married couple who had a young son. Her duties involved rising at 6am to do some cleaning before waking the couple&rsquo;s son, giving him breakfast and making him lunch. She then cleaned until 12pm and went to her bedroom until it was time to pick the boy up from school.</p>
<p>When they got home, Anna helped him with his homework, cooked and did other chores until 9pm when she went to bed. The woman would often call her to get out of bed to do more chores, such as fetching and carrying drinks and snacks for the family. &#8220;If I didn&rsquo;t hear her call, she would come upstairs and pour cold water on my face in bed,&#8221; Anna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman shouted at me, hit and beat me for things like not knowing that she had finished her cup of tea. The beatings increased over time. The woman also sent me to clean the houses of several of her friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Anna was befriended by a woman whom she met at the school gates. She was initially suspicious that the woman&rsquo;s kindness was not &#8220;genuine&#8221;, and thought that if she went to her she would be kicked out on to the street. But in the end, she decided to ask her for help.</p>
<p>When Anna and her new guardian tried to find her a place at a local school, they were told nothing could be done because she had no identification papers. Finally, the new guardian decided to hand her over to the police.<br>

<p>So once again, we&rsquo;re made to understand that&rsquo;s it all the fault of whites. Though rather than &rsquo; a &#8220;British home&#8221; it would be more accurate to say &#8221; a house located in Britain&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW, these foreign profiteers were certainly claiming child benefit for their victims.</p>

		<p>My appreciation of this, intuitive, is that this is almost without exception dark skinned persons in England enslaving other dark skinned persons. NOT white English enslaving dark skinned foreigners.</p>

<p>How much does this sound like the Cinderella story? Except it is real!!</p>

		<p>Apparently the wise people who run Britain are too busy spying and taking away the rights of traditional British citizens to worry about slave trafficking. Britains leaders seem to be totally immoral people, with a sick agenda to boot.</p>

		<p>The same thing happens here in the States, by the same characters.  When they&rsquo;re found out, the masters and mistresses jump bail and go back to their homeland, and the slaves are given legal residence here and welfare for life.  </p>

		<p>London  &mdash;  May 2009:  An estimated 500 African children a year - many of them babies - are being trafficked into the UK where they end up working as virtual slaves, a new investigation has revealed. The children sold by their poor parents for up to $10,000 come mainly from West Africa, but there have been reports of children from other parts of the continent sold into slavery. An undercover reporter working for the Daily Telegraph newspaper was offered several children for sale by their parents in Nigeria: Two boys aged three and five for $10,000, or $5,000 for one, and a 10-month-old baby for $4,000.  Teenage girls - including some still pregnant - were willing to sell their babies for less than $2,000.  The Telegraph report said that &#8220;impoverished African parents are being lured by the traffickers&rsquo; promises of &#8216;a better life&rsquo; for their children, thousands of kilometres away in cities including London, Birmingham and Manchester. But, once brought to Britain, the children are used as a fraudulent means to obtain illicit housing and other welfare benefits, totalling tens of thousands of dollars each a year.  &#8220;From the age of seven, rather than being sent to school, they are exploited as domestic slaves, forced to work for up to 18 hours a day, cleaning, cooking and looking after other younger children, or put to work in restaurants and shops. Some of the children are also subjected to physical and sexual abuse, while others even find themselves accused of being witches and become victims of exorcism rites in &#8216;traditional&rsquo; African churches in Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campaigners have now demanded that the UK government and police take &#8220;urgent action&#8221; to end this &#8220;21st century child slavery.&#8221;  &#8220;These children are being abused under our noses in our own country,&#8221; said Chris Beddoe, the director of End Child Prostitution and Trafficking, a British-based coalition of international charities. &#8220;It is totally unacceptable. We need urgent action to identify these children as they enter the UK, find those who are being abused and offer proper protection to those who escape or are freed from their abusers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vernon Coaker, the Home Office minister responsible for the prevention of trafficking, described child traffickers as &#8220;evil&#8221; and said anybody who could buy and sell babies was &#8220;sick.&#8221; &#8220;We have tightened our visa requirements and our ports of entry and we are gathering intelligence to help us stop this horrific trade,&#8221; he said. The opposition Conservative party, however, says the problem has been well known for some time. David Davis, the Conservative shadow home secretary, said: &#8220;The government has utterly failed to take decisive action to tackle human trafficking.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent survey by the government&rsquo;s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre claimed that 330 children, including 14 aged under 12, many of them from Africa, had been trafficked into Britain over the past year.  The police and campaigners believe, however, that this is just the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; and that the true figure is likely to be in the thousands.  The traffickers are understood to use a network of corrupt officials and co-traffickers to obtain passports and visas, often giving the children new names.<br>
Many of the victims are flown directly from Lagos in Nigeria to London&rsquo;s airports. Others are taken, via other West African states such as Ghana and Benin, to &#8220;transit&#8221; cities, including Paris. A growing number of the African slave children arrive in Britain unaccompanied, as asylum-seekers, or with &#8220;private foster parents.&#8221;  Debbie Ariyo, the executive director of the London-based charity Africans Unite Against Child Abuse, said: &#8220;This trade is a disgrace. These children are not going to loving homes. They are being cynically used by adults as slave labour and to defraud the state and then when they get older and have served their purpose and no longer attract benefits, they are thrown out on to the streets with no papers even to prove who they are. These are damaged, traumatised children and we have to end this misery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaigners said that many of the slave children - psychologically and often physically damaged at 18 - were thrown out of the houses of their &#8220;owners.&#8221; They are left to fend for themselves, usually with no papers or documents to prove who they are. With nowhere to turn, many fall into crime and the sex trade. The end result is that many then go on to commit a crime or go to social services for help and are then usually brusquely deported as illegal immigrants. A senior Scotland Yard officer said that part of the problem was that &#8220;this is a hidden crime, going on largely in Britain&rsquo;s African communities and we would urge people in those communities to contact us if they suspect that any child in their area is being abused. We need their co-operation. They must not turn a blind eye.&#8221;  Godwin Morka, the executive director of Lagos&rsquo;s anti-trafficking unit, Nathip, told the Telegraph that child trafficking was &#8220;rampant&#8221; in many Nigerian states. &#8220;We know these children are not going to happy homes and we are doing what we can on limited resources.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read stories like this before and the slave owner is usually an Arab or Nigerian. This vile practice is abhorrent to the vast majority of white people but acceptable to those from the third world (or those recently graduated from).</p>
<p>  Notice how the reference is always to a &#8216;British home&rsquo; so concealing the racial identity of the slave owner and avoiding the apportioning of guilt to non-whites. A few uninformed and indoctrinated people may even assume that its their English neighbors engaging in slavery.</p>
<p>Britain is descending into chaos.</p>
<p>Arc.</p>
