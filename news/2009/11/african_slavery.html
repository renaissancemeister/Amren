<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8356357.stm">African Slavery Apology &#8216;Needed&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, November 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Traditional African rulers should apologise for the role they played in the slave trade, a Nigerian rights group has said in a letter to chiefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot continue to blame the white men, as Africans particularly the traditional rulers, are not blameless,&#8221; said the Civil Rights Congress.</p>
<p>The letter said some collaborated or actively sold off their subjects.</p>
<p>The group said it was time for African leaders to copy the US and the UK who have already said they were sorry.</p>
<p>It urged Nigeria&rsquo;s traditional rulers to apologise on behalf of their forefathers and &#8220;put a final seal to the history of slave trade&#8221;, AFP news agency reports.</p>
<p>Civil Rights Congress president Shehu Sani says they are calling for this apology because traditional rulers are seeking inclusion in the forthcoming constitutional amendment in Nigeria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that for them to have the moral standing to be part of our constitutional arrangement there are some historical issues for them to address,&#8221; he told the BBC World Service.</p>
<p>&#8220;One part of which is the involvement of their institutions in the slave trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that on behalf of the buyers of slaves, the ancestors of these traditional rulers &#8220;raided communities and kidnapped people, shipping them away across the Sahara or across the Atlantic&#8221;.</p>
<p>Millions of Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas over a period of about 450 years from the middle of the 15th Century.</p>
<p>More than a million people are thought to have died while in transit across the so-called &#8220;middle passage&#8221; of the Atlantic, due to the inhuman conditions aboard the slave ships and brutal suppression of any resistance.</p>
<p>Many slaves captured from the African interior died on the long journey to the coast.<br>

		<p>The idea that a person should, or even can, apologize for the actions of another is foolish. That being said, a person can comment that he disagrees with the actions of another, and condemns what that person did.</p>
<p>Since the &#8220;apology&#8221; trend among white politicians seems to be expected these days, blacks should at least acknowledge that their ancestors did sell blacks into slavery and were as much a part of the process as anyone else involved.</p>
<p>If we used the rules that apply to drug laws, they would be more culpable. Those who sell drugs are punished more severely than those who buy them. In the slave trade business, the black leaders were the first sellers.</p>
<p>I am somewhat perplexed by this statement: &#8220;Millions of Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas over a period of about 450 years from the middle of the 15th Century.&#8221; If they were brought to the Americas from about 1450, they would have greeted Columbus since he did not arrive until 1492.</p>

		<p>Africans apologizing for slavery? Please! Our liberal elite will never stand for it. It is much more convenient to ask white people to apologize, feel guilty, and wring more concessions to blacks, as well as provide convenient excuses for bad black behavior. What are American blacks going to get from Nigerians? Nothing. Worse, it might, just might, expiate some of that annoying &#8220;white guilt&#8221; that has been so useful to blacks. No, the good &#8216;ol Reverend Sharpton had better quickly tell those Africans to keep quiet, or they&rsquo;ll ruin everything.</p>

		<p>I think the Civil Rights Congress should also apologize. It&rsquo;s obvious that there is no possibility of granting a complete set of individual rights to everyone which won&rsquo;t conflict with each other. These civil rights groups privilege some rights over others and then ram through unpopular social changes. </p>

		<p>I read the original BBC article and the comments were sound and reasonable and well thought out. NO ONE seems to realize, however, that the number of slaves in the world RIGHT NOW is greater in number than it has ever been at any point in history! That includes sexual white slavery, indebtedness slavery, indentured servitude, etc. THIS is not even understood?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Millions of Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas over a period of about 450 years from the middle of the 15th Century.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a great example of exaggeration and hyperbole.  No black was brought to the New World until the early 17th century, and only were slaves before that.  And whites continued to be used as slaves after the arrival of blacks as well as some cases of native Amerinds (especially by Spain).  &#8220;Millions&#8221; of Africans, is another big leap.  When you condsider the size of the ships and review the actual data, this too is an exaggeration.  But it is also true that the entire economies of some African tribes were based soley on selling captive fellow blacks to Arab and later European traders.</p>
<p>There is a very good and concise collection of the history of the slave trade on Wikipedia.  It checks with other sources and provides many source history and documents in its bibliography.  Just search &#8220;History of Slave Trade.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you think about it, Obama&rsquo;s father descends from the Africans who were on the Supply-side of the slavery trade.  Obama&rsquo;s character acting, he&rsquo;s slumming it as he pretends to be a down-trodden Black American.  He&rsquo;s a modern day C. Thomas Howell&hellip;</p>

		<p>London  &mdash;  May 2009:  An estimated 500 African children a year - many of them babies - are being trafficked into the UK where they end up working as virtual slaves, a new investigation has revealed. The children sold by their poor parents for up to $10,000 come mainly from West Africa, but there have been reports of children from other parts of the continent sold into slavery. An undercover reporter working for the Daily Telegraph newspaper was offered several children for sale by their parents in Nigeria: Two boys aged three and five for $10,000, or $5,000 for one, and a 10-month-old baby for $4,000.  Teenage girls - including some still pregnant - were willing to sell their babies for less than $2,000.  The Telegraph report said that &#8220;impoverished African parents are being lured by the traffickers&rsquo; promises of &#8216;a better life&rsquo; for their children, thousands of kilometres away in cities including London, Birmingham and Manchester. But, once brought to Britain, the children are used as a fraudulent means to obtain illicit housing and other welfare benefits, totalling tens of thousands of dollars each a year.  &#8220;From the age of seven, rather than being sent to school, they are exploited as domestic slaves, forced to work for up to 18 hours a day, cleaning, cooking and looking after other younger children, or put to work in restaurants and shops. Some of the children are also subjected to physical and sexual abuse, while others even find themselves accused of being witches and become victims of exorcism rites in &#8216;traditional&rsquo; African churches in Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaigners said that many of the slave children - psychologically and often physically damaged at 18 - were thrown out of the houses of their &#8220;owners.&#8221; They are left to fend for themselves, usually with no papers or documents to prove who they are. With nowhere to turn, many fall into crime and the sex trade. The end result is that many then go on to commit a crime or go to social services for help and are then usually brusquely deported as illegal immigrants. A senior Scotland Yard officer said that part of the problem was that &#8220;this is a hidden crime, going on largely in Britain&rsquo;s African communities and we would urge people in those communities to contact us if they suspect that any child in their area is being abused. We need their co-operation. They must not turn a blind eye.&#8221;  Godwin Morka, the executive director of Lagos&rsquo;s anti-trafficking unit, Nathip, told the Telegraph that child trafficking was &#8220;rampant&#8221; in many Nigerian states. &#8220;We know these children are not going to happy homes and we are doing what we can on limited resources.&#8221;<br>

<p>When are we going to force the North African nations and Turkey to apologise to us for enslaving Europeans?<br>

		<p>Such apologies are meaningless but it does show that blacks in Africa are far more aware of the realities of the slave trade than blacks in the UK and US.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t condemn our ancesors for the practice of slavery because at the time when they were alive slavery was considered a normal fact of life. </p>
<p>We tend to forget that the idea that man should be free to determine his own destiny is really a new idea. There really was no place on earth where the institution of slavery was not practiced in one form or another. </p>
<p>I doubt if there is any person on earth that didn&rsquo;t have ancestors that were slaves at one time or other. The Jews may have been slaves to the Egyptians but they went on to enslave others. It was the way of the world and was accepted as a fact of life. </p>

		<p>Silly Cogitator, Africans discovered the New World in 1450 and built great civilizations here and had many scientific, artistic, and cultural innovations until the Whites arrived in 1492, stole it all, and took credit for it.  </p>

		<p>I am so sick of reading these articles which equate slavery with Africans. You&rsquo;d think they were the only ones who were ever enslaved.  Slavery was practiced around the world in many places, and ever since time began, by many nations who have gotten over it by now and moved on. Only Africans continue to howl about how they were exploited and insist on believing that it was all about them. </p>
<p>Well, sorry, but no it wasn&rsquo;t! This attitude is very childish and self-centered of them.  Not everything is about blacks.</p>
