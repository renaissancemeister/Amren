			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. police were today hunting for a missing five-year-old girl who was sold for sex by her mother.</p>
<p>Shaniya Davis has been missing for six days after she was last seen being carried into a hotel room by a man.</p>
<p>FBI agents and U.S. Marshalls have joined the nationwide search for the toddler amid fears she had been sold to a paedophile ring.</p>
<p>Police have charged the girl&rsquo;s mother Antoinette Davis with human trafficking and prostitution offences.</p>
<p>An arrest warrant issued for the 25-year-old said she allowed her daughter to be taken &#8216;with the intent that she be held in sexual servitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Davis, who is pregnant, first reported her daughter missing last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police were suspicious of her story after reviewing a timeline of the events leading up to her disappearance from a trailer park in Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p>
<p>They later found CCTV footage from a hotel 40 miles from Fayetteville showing the five year old girl being carried into a hotel room by Mario McNeill.</p>
<p>She has not been seen since and her mother has refused to cooperate with police.</p>
<p>Asked if police think the girl is still alive, Fayetteville police Sgt. John Somerindyke said: &#8216;We sure hope so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl had only been living with her mother for three weeks, according to her father Bradley Lockhart.</p>
<p>He had primary custody of the girl, but had agreed to let her stay with her mother after she found a place to live and held a job for six months.</p>
<p>Lockhart broke down in tears at a press conference when he sobbed: &#8216;I just want her to come back safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police have not charged anyone with molesting Shaniya, but said the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>The man accused of taking her turned himself in on Friday. Police said he admitted to kidnapping the child and has been charged with kidnap.</p>
<p>According to arrest documents, Davis &#8216;knowingly provided Shaniya Davis with the intent that she be held in sexual servitude&rsquo; and she &#8216;permitted an act of prostitution.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Another cautionary tale of a white/black coupling that ends in tragedy.  I believe they found the child&rsquo;s body yesterday and are performing an autopsy.  </p>

		<p>Disgusting.</p>
<p>People like Antoinette Davis should not be allowed to bring children into this world.</p>
<p>What kind of a sick monster would sell their 5-year-old daughter into sexual slavery?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a racial issue, it is just low lives behaving like they mostly do.</p>

		<p>There should be a website warning whites of the dangers of miscegenation. Exhibit A would be OJ and Nicole Simpson. Exhibit B would be this white guy who fathers Shaniya, then gains custody because the black mom doesn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>So he leaves his daughter w/her anyway and she pimps her own 5 year old girl to a guy named Mario Andretti(!) McNeil.<br>

		<p>One of the devices blacks use to attempt to cover their unbelievable amount of dysfunctional/Pedophilic/Child Abusive/Criminal behavior is to jump on these websites and declare that &#8220;this isn&rsquo;t about race&#8221; and &#8220;all races have criminals&#8221; or &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think this is a racial issue&#8221; while trying to avoid the facts. I see this is a lot of discussion forums dealing with the latest atrocity like Channon Christian or Anne Pressly. This seems to be a concerted, organized effort to derail the national discussion from the racial issue with the threat that even if the issue is racially based, even bringing it up is racist. Watch for it.</p>

		<p>This sort of crime is a way by which certain drug users pay off a big time debt? They had this case several years ago now in Chi where these two young girls, sisters, just disappered and never were seen again, NOT even bodies found. The thought was sexual servitude to pay off drug debt, but nothing ever came of the case after the mother clammed up when certain accusations were made. This was the Bradley investigation.</p>

		<p>Another example of things our grandparents knew and warned about, but of course we are so diverse we discounted them as old racists.  The new world hasn&rsquo;t changed much, certain ethnicites just have more freedom to practice their amoral behavior.</p>

		<p>What have human beings become?  A child should be able to trust its paretns and look for protection.  We now have women child molesters, men who sexually abuse their own children and what is so bad, that every time one of these incidents happens we human beings become less and less mortified by these actions.  I am hurt to my soul for the fear that must have gripped this little angels being. She will be forever in my heart and mind.  WHAT HAVE HUMAN BEINGS BECOME? </p>

		<p>Neither one you of ignorant people get the real story here. The so called mother is just plain evil and the men are just sick bastards! The real story is the poor baby that has suffered the ultimate price and her father and family. WTH are you people discussing race for. A child has been violated and killed. That&rsquo;s what you should be blogging about! I am not black and I&rsquo;m totally ashamed of the comments that are listed here about warning us about being with other races and the outcome. Let&rsquo;s face it, there are sick and twisted people of ALL Races! Take your blinders off and see the big picture!!!!</p>

		<p>I am white and this is not a racial issue! That is pure ignorance to think that just because of someone&rsquo;s skin color they are prone to the worst of all human behaviours. Look at the recent case in california (Jaycee Lee Dugard) where the kidnapper kept the girl in his backyard for 18 years. HE WAS WHITE! This is an issue about desperate people with no morals.  These people, no matter their race, should all be put to death! The only thing that brings me a little peace about this issue is that these people will be tortured/murdered brutually in prison by the rest of the prison population. </p>
