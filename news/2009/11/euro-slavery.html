<p>Just the other day I came across this fascinating  Turkish despiction of the Ottoman fleet (in alliance with the French) attacking Nice in 1543.  [By way of explanation, Nice (then Nizza) was not yet French then, but Italian.]  It shows much detail.  Many features of the city and landscape can still be recognized today. For nearly a thousand years the Mediterranean was tormented by Barbary pirates, just as a mangy dog is tortured by fleas.    <br>
Do note that the Turks carried off 2,500 &#8220;captives&#8221; (ie. slaves).<br>
Note the Turkish galleys, rowed by slaves. <br>

<p><br>
  <i>&#8220;In 729 the city repulsed the Saracens; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.  <br>
 In 1543, Nice was attacked by the united Franco-Ottoman forces of Francis I and Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, in the &#8216;Siege of Nice&rsquo;.  Although the inhabitants repulsed the assault which followed the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately forced to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and carry off 2,500 captives.&#8221; </i></p>

		<p>Interesting review and book definately on my list!</p>
<p>Perhaps Amren might look into the current problem of White female sex slave trade?  I have read elsewhere for years about this problem and even saw at least one documentary on it.  I understand that an entire generation of Ukrainian women is missing, as well as many Russian women.  And it appears the Turks, those would-be Europeans, are the main consumers, but certainly not the only ones.</p>

		<p>This is a portion of history that the historians are loathe to cover? White people being made slaves has a certain fascination in some quarters. The Tartars and Muslims of the Ottoman Empire called it &#8220;harvesting the steppes&#8221;! Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, etc.</p>
<p>It was primarily the efforts of the famous Polish cavalry, the &#8220;winged Hussars&#8221; that put a stop to these razzias [raids]!</p>
<p>Over a period of several hundred years, about a million whites were made slaves of the Muslims. Slavs sold in the slave markets of Istanbul.</p>
<p>When Poland was a military superpower, using 1,000 kilometer cavalry sweeps, that is what put a stop to these predations! Cavalry carrying lance, musket, pistols, sabre, six foot long rapier, war hammer and bow and arrows!! One man-a-horse properly equipped for no-holds-barred battle.</p>
<p>And this sort of thing is ONLY NOW gaining a proper appreciation by the historians. Was known for a long time, but ignored.</p>

		<p>Europe was threatened by many peoples, of different racial stocks: The Huns, the Mongols, the Turks, Arabs, Moors. Interesting though, that we hear over and over about &#8220;The White Man did this, that, and, that&hellip;&#8221; etc. etc. etc. It just goes to show that history is not about any one race, or nation, oppressing another. It is about the stronger groups oppressing the weak. And it is time for the White People of the Western nations to ask? Do we want to be among the strong, or among the weak? Do we want to depend on ourselves to defend our interests, or do we want to depend on the &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;benevolence&#8221; of the non-white peoples for our survival? </p>
<p>Finally, if we do not defend our own interests as a race, who will?</p>

<p>Just like it was known for a long time, but ignored, that it was a Polish king (Jan III Sobieski) leading 37,000 heavy armed Polish cavalry &amp; foot soldiers, joined up with and led tens of thousands of Austrian and German soldiers to utterly route the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683.  </p>
<p>This decisive battle turned the tide of Turkish expansion into Central Europe, just as the third Battle of Lepanto (1571), in which a pan-European navy comprised mainly of Southern Europeans, destroyed forever Turkey&rsquo;s plans for the Meditteranean.  Again, known, but ignored.<br>

		<p>I doubt if this video will bring much protest from the Muslim world. This seems to show a world that Muslims are proud of. It was a time when Islam was strong and Europe was weak. This was a time when the Turks kept the teachings of Mohammad and attacked the Infields for slaves and other booty. Unlike the Western nations, the Muslims seem to show no shame in there  bloody and violent past. Even today slavery continues in Africa. I think the Muslims look forward to the days when they can again bring White slaves out of Europe.</p>

		<p>The North Africans themselves have largely occulted this long period from their history. Their dilemma is that whilst it gives them the huge satisfaction of having humiliated and terrorised the Kuffar for centuries, it also means that many, many of them probably carry the blood of slave ancestors, such was the scale of the concubinage of female slaves. It is more difficult to take pride in who you are if you are descended from slaves.</p>
<p>The history also conflicts with their self-image as noble victims, whose current problems are caused by Europeans and entitle them to apologies and financial compensation ( especially Algeria with France and Libya with Italy )</p>
<p>How then do Magrebins explain to themselves the fact that so many of them could pass as Europeans? ( &#8220;pas typé&#8221; as they say in France? ) Why, they will tell you absolutely sincerely and with obvious delight, their European traits are from the Vikings! (- a few of whom did indeed voyage as far as North Africa.) And who would not take pride in Viking blood?</p>
<p>Their whole culture is schizophrenic.</p>

		<p>Some of those White slaves became the backbone of the Turkish Empire. The feared Janissaries were primarily made up of White Christians from Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Romania, Georgia, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. The sinister Turks used the superior fighting ability of Whites against the White nations themselves. Disunity among Europeans was perhaps a bigger threat to our ancestors than any non-White power. Instead of fighting against each other we should have united and destroyed the Turkish menace forever. If the British, French, Prussian, Spanish, Polish, Austrian, Swedish, Russian, Dutch etc&hellip; would have joined forces and attacked the Turkish empire, Istanbul would be Constantinople again today. White disunity has been our biggest weakness.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes, that is right.  I was being breif, but the entire picture is much larger.  I lived in the Balkans while this sex slave trade was beginning.  It happens that UN Peacekeepers in Bosnia and Kosovo have been among the pimps best clients.  Also, this slave trade and trafficking of humans has gone as far as London and even to our own shores.<br>

<p>Yes, but that conquest was brief. In the context of history, French rule lasted merely a century (for Morocco, less than half a century, just 44 yrs.).  Now, the tables are reversed and North Africa is again invading and terrorizing France!  There is no resistance.</p>
<p>From the native French, intimidated with hate-speech laws and anti-racism propaganda,  hardly a peep is heard, and no significant objections or complaints are allowed under penalty of law.</p>
<p>Their post-WW2 rulers are determined to get them &#8220;diversified&#8221;. The disempowered French people are helpless to resist because they are betrayed from above by their own rulers.</p>

  &#8220;Baltimore is a good book to read on this subject.  Janisaries is the name of the elite military forces which were largely made up of white captives-children trained to be loyal to saladin.This a worthy subject to research.<br>
  I have a think that many of the young children,and women that dissapear today wind up in soddie arabia etc.There ara a lot of Iranian girls who dissapear also.</p>

<p>You are right. Most of the people here don&rsquo;t know anything about Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Slaves were taken from the Balkans, not from Russia or Poland or Ukraine. Boys, mostly Albanians, went to the army, girls to the palace.</p>
<p>Those personal soldiers (Janissaries which means &#8220;New Soldier&#8221;) were raised by Turkish families in Anatolia and those who survived all wars, assimilated into the society by marriage.</p>

<p>You should have said &#8220;most&#8221; slaves were taken from the Balkans. That would be probably true. But there were plenty taken from elsewhere&hellip;all the way from Iceland to Nubia. And MANY from the Ukraine/Russian steppes, the Crimea and Caucasus. </p>
<p>Albanians, being Moslems, did NOT become slaves!  A Moslem could not enslave another Moslem.  Albanians helped their Turkish overlords to &#8220;harvest&#8221; the Christian Serbs and others   &mdash;   which is why they&rsquo;re hated by their neighbors to this day.</p>

		<p>Dear ghw:</p>
<p><b>Albanians, being Moslems, did NOT become slaves! </b></p>
<p>Albanians (who are most probably descendants of ancient Illyrians) were forcibly (sometimes voluntarily to become more powerful) converted by Turks. They are originally not of Muslim origin. And today, 70% of Albanians are no more Muslims.</p>
<p>And Ottoman slavery was very different from its western counterpart. A slave could become a army general, a statesman (most of Sadrazams were of foreign origin). Some poor families gave their children freely to let them become powerful individuals in the state. The system favored converts over the Ethnic Turks, so by the end of 15th century all the elite ruling class of the Ottoman Empire was of convert origin. Taking into account of origins of Sultans who were mostly mothered by foreign women, the empire was far from being ethnically Turkish. </p>
<p>See devsirme for further information.</p>
<p><br>
<b>all the way from Iceland to Nubia. </b></p>
<p>Barbary pirates weren&rsquo;t Turks but mostly Arabized Berbers (who can pass for Europeans). Although they were subject to Ottoman Empire, they practiced their &#8220;jobs&#8221; freely. And yes, a pirate is a pirate no matter what religion he&rsquo;s got, like the European pirates whose jobs were not different. A Turk could mean everyone who is Muslim at that time.</p>
<p><b>And MANY from the Ukraine/Russian steppes, the Crimea and Caucasus.</b></p>
<p>Crimea was home of the Tatar population. A number of Turkic peoples, now collectively known as the Crimean Tatars, have been inhabiting the peninsula since the early Middle Ages. The ethnicity of the Crimean Tatars is quite complex as it absorbed both nomadic Turkic and European components (in the first place, the Goths and the Genoese) which is still reflected in their appearance and language differences.</p>
<p>Tatar invasions was just a response to Russian Imperialism. Note the Muslims (although most of them are not religious) in the Russian proper are not immigrants, they&rsquo;ve been living there for over 1000 years.</p>
<p>After the treaty of Kücük Kaynarca in 1774, Crimean Tatars became &#8220;independent&#8221; from Ottoman Empire which of course meant they were going to be invaded by Russians (and they got annexed by 1783).</p>
<p>Russian Imperialism in the Caucasus was little different from Crimea. From 1763 to 1864, the Circassians fought against the Russians in the Russian-Circassian War. Afterwards, large numbers of Circassians were exiled and deported to the Ottoman Empire; others were resettled in Russia far from their home territories.</p>
<p>I agree that Ottoman Empire was far from being innocent but some facts should not be twisted to play the victim role.<br>

		<p>People also forget that Black africans were orginally enslaved by Muslims raids in the early Middle Ages. No mention of this, only American slavery. I also don&rsquo;t see Muslims feeling the least bit guilty or anyone trying to make them feel guilty, like they do with Whites in America.</p>
