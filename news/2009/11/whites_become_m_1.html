<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A historic win for a black woman on Staten Island and a Chinese-American woman in Chinatown have helped make a little more election history  &mdash;  for the first time, people of color will hold the majority of seats on the New York City Council.</p>
<p>When newly elected members take office in January, the 51-person Council will have 27 members of color, accounting for slightly more than 50 percent.</p>
<p>The shift reflects demographic change citywide. Non-Hispanic whites make up 35 percent of the population, while Hispanics are 28 percent, non-Hispanic blacks are at 24 percent, and non-Hispanic Asians at 12 percent, according to Census estimates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pushing the minorities into the majority, will be Margaret Chin, the first Chinese-American elected to represent Chinatown, and Debi Rose, the first African-American ever elected on Staten Island.</p>
<p>Both will be filling seats that were previously held by white men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an indication that democracy is getting better,&#8221; said John Liu, the first Asian American on the council and now as comptroller-elect, the first Asian American to be voted into citywide office.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the high level offices in government are filled by people of different faces, it&rsquo;s good for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilmember Charles Barron said the important step would be getting minority councilmembers into positions of leadership on important committees like finance and land use, and into positions like Council Speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m saying while the demographics have changed, so should the power equation change,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;New York City is now majority people of color,&#8221; Barron said, but &#8220;unless there are policy changes, budget priority changes, power position changes, it&rsquo;s just numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose was hopeful the increasing presence of people of color would have an impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;By having minorities in the majority, the conversations change. In the committees, conversations will be different,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>I noticed that Michael Bloomberg barely eked out a win for a third term, after having demanded and gotten city charter changes to lift the two term limit for mayors.  I think his fulmination came off as arrogant, and almost made enough people mad to make the difference.  I would have been happy to have seen him bounced out on Tuesday, alas no.  Though this is NYC we&rsquo;re talking about here; Rudy Giuliani, pro-aborticide, gun grabber, racial egalitarian and all that, is considered &#8220;conservative&#8221; there, but his act draws 0.1% of the vote west of the Hudson and south of the Statue of Theoretical Liberty.</p>

		<p>If some people feel empowered by counting the Asian lady to make up their &#8220;minority majority,&#8221; more power to them. But I would submit that among racial &#8220;averages,&#8221; Asians don&rsquo;t have an awful lot in common with their &#8220;colored&#8221; breathern  &mdash;  -education, income, crime rate just to name a few.</p>

<p>Sounds like the writer just takes for granted that non whites are expected to vote along racial lines. I wonder if she thinks its ok for whites to do the same? Or would that be racist??</p>

		<p>Please tell me what a &#8220;non-hispanic white&#8221; is?  Dare I guess that it is someone whose grandparents were Irish, English, German, Italian or Polish?  Am I to assume that the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; have reached such critical mass that the rest of us white Americans can only be identified as being &#8220;non-hispanic&#8221; whites????  So all that counts is being &#8220;hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;non-hispanic&#8221;?  And since when are &#8220;hispanics&#8221; who are a mix of Mexican Indian and Spanish, &#8220;whites&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Not a big deal. None of the &#8220;non-diverse&#8221; people on the council ever speak up for whitey. If anything, it points the way to more conflict between and among blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others as whites look on passively.</p>

<p>Translation: unless we can run down increased racial spoils (affirmative action) for OUR people of color, and unless we can force minority whites to pay more in welfare taxes for OUR &#8220;people of color&#8221; it just doesn&rsquo;t add up for us.</p>

<p>Yes, and as it got darker, it became more and more Third World.  For the past half century, Whites have been leaving it in droves, myself included.  It really was a great, great city.  But, sadly, not anymore.<br>

<p>Wrong!  </p>
<p>It merely heralds the beginning of inevitable eventual racial in-fighting and organizational chaos due to race awareness squabbling, accusations of self-interest manipulation and racial bias amongst the hotch-potch of competing breeds when to comes to allocating taxpayers&rsquo; funds to the various multi-racial group beneficiaries, not to mention accusations of preferential treatment with regards to the employment of ancilliary/support staff, and, of course, the usual charges of corruption and impropriety, etc, etc.</p>
<p>It will be the classic case of &#8216;I told you so&rsquo; due to the myriad alien ethnicities being forced to occupy the same living space(s) and wrestle each other for dominance, prestige and the perks that go with it. <br>

		<p>Let New York continue the decent. The fact that this &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; has transpired is an indication what has grown up around the city.  Detroit has been blessed with this type of leadership, have you really seen the results?  Mark my words the results will be identical.  When I see the old Bond movies I long for the lost America.

		<p>[i]And since when are &ldquo;hispanics&rdquo; who are a mix of Mexican Indian and Spanish, &ldquo;whites&rdquo;?[/i]</p>
<p>Annie,</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Management and Budget currently defines &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; as &#8220;a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.&#8221;  The term includes, for example, my friend Cristina from Chile, who looks like she just walked off the streets of Hamburg even though her family has been in the Americas for over 200 years.</p>
<p>You are probably thinking of &#8220;mestizo,&#8221; who are an admixture of Spanish and indigenous blood. About 62% of the population of Mexico would be classified as mestizo, 31% are pure or nearly pure indigenous or [i]indio[/i], and the remaining 7% would be classified as &#8220;caucasion,&#8221; which would include those of  Spanish(mainly), French, German, Irish, British, Polish, Russian, and other European extractions as well as Jewish (mainly Ashkenazy and some Shephardic) and Lebanese.</p>

<p>#4 T rexx, I liked this, we can use the military type of acronym &#8220;STOP&#8221; so describe such a city! And to poster #11, I personally believe many of us on amren know something about Roman history and can pretty much define WHY the Rome we know and loved fell!!

		<p>Apparently our Census Bureau is afraid to name &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; as the likely race they are.  The vast majority of Hispanic people entering our country today are either (a) 100% South or Central American Indian, or (b) an admixture of 85% South or Central American Indian + 15% White, Black or Other.  It would be more correct if these mixed race people were identified as Mestizos or Indians.  Our government is playing this game because it doesn&rsquo;t want to bring to our awareness that Mexico is expanding its borders and we are uniting our country&rsquo;s special destiny to that of Mexico.  </p>
<p>If American Blacks (who on average are about 85% Black and 15% White or Other) happily identify as Blacks, why aren&rsquo;t South American and Central American Mestizos (who on average are about 85% Indian and 15% White or Other) called Indians?  Are they unaware that they are primarily Indian and do they fantasize they are 95% Spanish?  </p>
<p>I believe our invaders have an identity crisis and a disordered superiority/inferiority complex which fuels their anger toward all Whites.  The Indian part of their admixture resents the Spanish for conquering their ancestors, and they transfer that resentment toward all White Americans.  At the same time they admire White civilization and want our genes to mix with theirs because it uplifts their race.</p>
<p>Did you know that the Spanish in Spain consider Central and South American Mestizos to be Indians?  Their Spanish surnames have apparently not convinced the Spanish that they are their genetic kin.   </p>
<p>I wonder, when the barbarian tribes were invading Ancient Rome just before it fell, did the Roman Senate call native Romans &#8220;non-Barbarian Romans&#8221;?</p>

<p>Good post Sir,</p>
<p>Giuliani was a good mayor, especially following dinkins, a world class fool. </p>
<p>My analysis is that there might someday be an Asian mayor, there&rsquo;ll never again be a black one. The Jewish people will never allow it. Not after dinkins.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Please tell me what a &ldquo;non-hispanic white&rdquo; is?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are White hispanics. Hispanic means  anyone who is from the Spanish-speaking world or whose ancestry is from the Spanish-speaking world and considers his/herself Hispanic. There are many Hispanics who are soley of European descent. Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba etc. have citizens whose ancestors came only from Spain or sometimes Italy, France and other European nations. In the USA, there are Hispanics whose forebearers came from Argentina, Cuba etc. and are soley of European descent. These are &#8220;White Hispanics.&#8221; Non-White hispanics are those of mixed &#8220;mestizo&#8221; or pure Indian or sometimes even African/Asian descent. Most non-White Hispanics are &#8220;mestizo&#8221; of mixed Spanish/Indian descent. Thus, a non-hispanic White is someone whose European forebearers did not come from a Spanish-speaking country.</p>

		<p>Please visualize the future when those in power institute (all non-aryan), their whims and philosophies.  As you walk down the street there will be statures of blacks, pictures of blacks, king, x et al.  No aryans will be around to blame for anything nor to tax and exploit.  The exploitation of aryans will have ended, then the world will be right&hellip;just like Zimbabwe, or Detroit. The non-white Hispanics (don&rsquo;t you love that?), will be shifting between all the Americas and enjoying being third class citizens.  The Asians won&rsquo;t be here but will be in charge.</p>

		<p>You are correct, Anonymous.  Mexicans have a massive, conflicted, neurotic identity crisis.  &#8220;Mestizo&#8221; means a European+Indian mongrel.  </p>
<p>On the one hand, Mexican peasants worship their mongrel blood, which they call &#8220;mestisaje&#8221; or &#8220;mestizo-ness&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;La Malinche&#8221; was the Indian concubine of Cortez, having at least one of his children, and is semi-worshipped by many Mexican peasants.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Malinche" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Malinche</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, many Mexican peasants hate her, calling her &#8220;La Chingada&#8221; (The Whore) because she preferred to be impregnated by a rich, powerful white man instead of her own kind.</p>
<p>Mestisaje as an identity is used to protect the white overlords of Mexico.  </p>
<p>As Vincente Fox said, &#8220;we are all Mestisaje&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Loosely translated this means, &#8220;don&rsquo;t kill us for ruthlessly exploiting you dumb ignorant peasants since we are all one people.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By having minorities in the majority, the conversations change. In the committees, conversations will be different,&rsquo; she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they will be different Comrade Rose, very different!</p>
<p>They will consist of rambling, ungrammatical, and profane diatribes of excuse making for minority social pathologies and accusations directed at &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; for causing them. Also, spicing things up will be conversations deteriorating from mere spoken words into rhythmic chanting or raucous singing; and when the pot really gets boiling, unintelligible or threatening grunts, hoots, and chirping will replace language of any kind altogether. </p>
<p>It should all be quite &ldquo;enriching,&rdquo; to say the very least!</p>

		<p>Charles Barron is a well-known nut who&rsquo;s tight with the ACORN-dominated Working Families Party.  He&rsquo;s also a close ally of Reverend Al Sharpton.  Need I say more?</p>

		<p>When did they start classifying races using the non-Hispanic prefix?  Is this new, or has it been going on for awhile?</p>

		<p>A few years ago, Barron wanted to &#8220;slap a white person for his mental health.&#8221; A real winner.</p>

		<p>jdavis, #27, I hate to interrupt your excellent visualization: but once we Whites have been eliminated, do you really think there will be streets and statues?  </p>
<p>Well, I suppose dirt paths could be considered &#8216;streets&rsquo;, and those things the Africans carved could be considered &#8216;statues&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yup #10, I agree. Despite that they still have movies set in, and boast on NYC culture, the Yankees, and other things, like a big Chamber of Commerce ad all the time for NYC, you think they would stop by now. Interestingly related to this after the California crisis hit, they were still playing the &#8216;come to California&rsquo; ads on TV where I am, (not in California) for about a month after.<br>
I wonder how long before Hollywood will stop pumping up NYC and LA?</p>
