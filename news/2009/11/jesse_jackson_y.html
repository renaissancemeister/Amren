			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Soraghan, The Hill, November 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Wednesday night criticized Rep. Artur Davis (D-Ala.) for voting against the Democrats&rsquo; signature healthcare bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;We even have blacks voting against the healthcare bill,&#8221; Jackson said at a reception Wednesday night. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t vote against healthcare and call yourself a black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark stirred a murmur at the reception, held by the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Foundation as part of a series of events revolving around the 25th anniversary of Jackson&rsquo;s run for president. Several CBC members were in attendance, including Chairwoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who&rsquo;d introduced Jackson.</p>
<p>Davis, who is running for governor, is the only black member of Congress from Alabama.</p>
<p>He is also the only member of the CBC to have voted against the healthcare bill earlier this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson {snip} added that he wasn&rsquo;t saying that black lawmakers must vote a certain way. Instead, they should vote the interests of the people in their districts, and he said the healthcare bill would help Alabama because it&rsquo;s one of the poorest states in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other members of the CBC found no fault in Jackson&rsquo;s words. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) was in the audience. He called Jackson&rsquo;s criticism of Davis &#8220;accurate,&#8221; but said he did not hear Jackson say &#8220;You can&rsquo;t vote against healthcare and call yourself a black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is an issue that disproportionately impacts black folks, race has to be considered,&#8221; Cleaver said. Jackson, he added, &#8220;is expected by his constituency to call balls and strikes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t be a race baiter and extort money from businesses on the threat of picketing, boycotting or suing, for some &#8220;racial&#8221; pretense, and be a black man.<br>
Oh wait, I guess you can!</p>

		<p>Ironically, Emmanuel Cleaver wants to have one day without complaining.  I suppose the next thing for Jesse Jackson will be to leave business cards with every black legislator not on the reservation promising &#8220;visits&#8221; for their lack of racial rectitude.</p>

		<p>I went to school in K.C. school district when E.C. was the mayor. It was great. metal detectors, gangs, guns and drugs. perfect atmosphere for learning. </p>
<p>   He made sure that all the inner city schools with mostly non White population&rsquo;s had brand new building&rsquo;s and state of the art equipment. </p>
<p>      On the other hand the out lying schools with a higher White mixture. Went into disrepair,and eventually annexed into a better school district. Some of them could not even be used because of health concerns and all had to be renovated to some extent.</p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson has a point . I do believe that the slaves on southern plantations had single payor healthcare. Provided by the plantation  owner. Blacks cannot seem to avoid being some ones slave can they. So please cease feeling guilty about slavery. Blacks are the ones who should feel guilty about it.</p>

		<p>I agree completely with the good &#8220;reverend&#8221;. You can&rsquo;t vote against handouts and call yourself a Black Man.</p>

		<p>Blacks can certainly vote for every giveaway program that comes along..and whites can just a quickly refuse to pay for them. <br>
And in the end Obama will exit the White House just as he came in..a fraud with zero accomplishments.</p>

		<p>Well, hey, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been a disappointment if Jesse DIDN&rsquo;T say that or something close to it?  I mean, let&rsquo;s hear it for consistency!  Anytime the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t might give out free money or services, Jesse is right there with his hand outstretched, of course planning to pass along the goods to less-fortunate blacks.  He epitomizes the something-for-nothing demanders, and he&rsquo;ll keep on doing it until his demise.  He&rsquo;s the leader of the victim-mentality entitlement-demanding ghetto blacks, remember?</p>

		<p>Jackson is right, you can&rsquo;t call yourself self-dependent and a black man.  Blacks, generally of course, will take as many government handouts as they can get because they feel they are &#8220;owed&#8221; something thanks to white liberals.  </p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson is a pure racist.  He has oppressed the white population his whole career.  Every &#8220;real&#8221; white man in America knows he is nothing but an african racist oppressor.  He supported welfare and now we all see welfare as a way to enslave caucasians.  Jesse Jackson survived only because he had those shyster white bolshevik meida types who looked after him.  Those shyster white bolsheviks are also our oppressors and I&rsquo;m happy to say that our grass roots efforts to speak out against those racist anti-white shysters is doing quite well thank you.</p>
