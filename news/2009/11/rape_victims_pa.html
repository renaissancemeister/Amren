<h1>Rape Victim&rsquo;s Parents Charged With Abuse</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, November 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The parents of an 8-year-old Liberian girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted by four boys in July were arrested Friday on child abuse charges, according to Arizona police.</p>
<p>The father, 59, and mother, 47, were arrested Friday in Phoenix on seven counts of child abuse, said police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The child abuse investigation was based on documented incidents from the Phoenix Police Department and numerous referrals to Arizona Child Protective Services dating to 2005.</p>
<p>Police said the parents, refugees from the West African nation, used sticks, wires and their fists to hit their young daughter.</p>
<p>Witnesses told CNN affiliate KTVK that the parents left their daughter wandering their apartment complex alone at night, begging for food.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The parents said they felt they had been shamed by their child and blamed her for being victimized. As a result, the girl was taken from her home and placed in state custody.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>The parents of this girl should be permanently exiled to Liberia or another African country of their choice, if they are convicted. Their daughter should also be exiled.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t matter to these parents if they served the maximum sentence for child abuse - chances are, they&rsquo;d get out and do it again.</p>

		<p>This is ghastly, but not altogether unexpected. The father stated right after the assualt that the famiy had been shamed and did not want the child victim, but apparently someone  informed him he wasn&rsquo;t presenting a very good image to the public, and he suppossedly recanted. I&rsquo;m just surprised the poor child is still alive and has not been a victim of an &#8220;Honor killing&#8221;.<br>
BTW:: why are we taking in &#8220;refugees&#8221; from Liberia? Didn&rsquo;t we buy them their own little chunk of Africa and settle all the freed slaves who wished to go on their own personal little piece of their &#8220;Motherland&#8221;? Apparently they&rsquo;ve trashed it, and now they want to come back.</p>

		<p>	Whites have demonstrated an extraordinary benevolence and tolerance towards less productive races for decades, we have transgressed the law of natural selection by not only supporting inferior life-forms, but actually encouraging their propagation; the off spring of these people have little to contribute, and have become a burdened to society.</p>

		<p>These are the kind of people the liberals want in our country.<br>
In fact they&rsquo;re rabidly advocated the invasion of America by non-whites.  </p>
<p>The liberals believe that whites are evil and people such as this are good.  </p>

		<p>#5 Michael C Scott: Good to see you commenting here again.  Your question is obviously rhetorical; the answer, of course is (sing it with me) &#8220;diversity, our greatest strength&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t know what genius thought that one up, or how he sold it to so many gullible people.</p>
<p>It occurs to me (and I&rsquo;m not a believer in any religion) that the perfect metaphor for diversity is the biblical image of a statue with feet of iron and clay. It&rsquo;s actually quite interesting; the book of Daniel describes a dream of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar of a giant statue with a head of gold, chest and shoulders of silver, belly of bronze, legs of iron and feet of iron and clay.  Daniel interprets this dream, saying the head represents the Babylonian empire, and the other parts succeeding empires.</p>
<p>Gold was a perfect metaphor for the splendour of Babylonian empire, which had golden statues in the streets. The succeeding empires to the Babylonian were the Medo-Persian, Greek and Roman, each well represented by the silver, bronze and iron respectively (e.g. Rome&rsquo;s rule was certainly iron-fisted; moreover, Rome owed much of its success to the fact that they used weapons of iron, while most of their rivals used bronze).</p>
<p>And, what have we here? A civilization consisting of an amalgam of the remnants of the Roman empire with the worthless dross of the third world, that believes that the clay mixed in with the iron makes it stronger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not holding a sign saying &#8220;the end is nigh!&#8221;.  Just strikes me as interesting.</p>

		<p>During November 2008, UK channel 4 TV visited Nigeria to report on &#8216;child witches&rsquo;. Following this broadcast, their website had millions of hits and donations poured in to a White run UK charity working there providing medical care, shelter, food and schooling for these young children. Last night, Channel 4 broadcast a follow-up report. The case mentioned here via AMREN, is terrible in itself but the TV report, mainly investigating &#8216;evangelical churches&rsquo; and various ministers, bishops and the like viewed like a horror film. How about a two year old girl, pronounced as a witch by the local pastor (in return for a donation) taken home and sat on a fire to &#8216;cleanse&rsquo; her of evil. The huge scars were shown to the camera. Then the 6 year old boy whose father bathed him in acid as instructed by one of these &#8216;church ministers&rsquo;.. they boy died at the aid shelter a couple of days later. Sadly I have no link but I&rsquo;m sure anyone interested can look online. These evil black african tribal customs are taken with them when they settle in one of our White countries and only rarely come to our attention as in this AMREN story when the parents said they were &#8216;shamed&rsquo; by their little girl. Well, they are hardly likely to mention witchcraft to the police but it&rsquo;s a sure bet they avidly attend their local evangelical church where few whites ever venture so just use your imagination and a little logic next time you pass by and hear the preacher yelling at the enthusiastic crowd and the resulting chanting and wailing from within. You may wonder why child services don&rsquo;t get more involved, but perhaps the very ones dealing with the case are, themselves, black african and wish to preserve their &#8216;cultural heritage&rsquo; against any White racist meddling. </p>

		<p>The United States buys land in Africa to repatriate ex-slaves from Africa. Those same ex-slaves leave Africa to go to the United States as refugees. No, this is not the plot of a Monty Python movie, he was good, but not that good.<br>

		<p>What do we expect? We have allowed all these nonwhite immigrants/refugees into our land without so much a protest. Instead of the civil &#8220;rights&#8221; act we should have demanded that all blacks be sent to Liberia as Lincoln said he wanted. That blacks and Whites should never live under the same government (land). We reap what we sow apparently.</p>

		<p>Nigeria has launched a crackdown on the abuse of children branded as witches following an investigation by Channel 4&rsquo;s Dispatches programme. The programme, called Saving Africa&rsquo;s Witch Children, detailed how young children accused of witchcraft were being abandoned, tortured, starved and murdered - all in the name of Jesus Christ. A man calling himself &#8220;the bishop&#8221;, who said he had killed more than 100 people possessed by the devil, has now been arrested after being exposed in the programme, broadcast last month. Chief Godswill Akpabio, governor of Akwa Ibom state, has pledged to &#8220;destroy and demolish&#8221; every church engaged in such practices. The state will also now strengthen laws to protect children from those who trade on superstitions about black magic. He added: &#8220;We must fight against the abuse of children and ensure proper education for them.&#8221;  Gary Foxcroft, the director of Stepping Stones, a charity which provided much of the information for the programme, said: &#8220;The international outrage generated by the film has led to the Akwa Ibom State Government taking urgent action to address the gross violations of child rights that have been taking place in the state due to the belief in child &#8216;witches&rsquo;. &#8220;Stepping Stones Nigeria welcomes this positive intervention and sincerely hopes that this will mark the beginning of a more long term governmental strategy to help protect and save the lives of stigmatised children in Akwa Ibom State.&#8221;<br>

Exactly.  Exile the WHOLE lot of them. All.  Don&rsquo;t keep the girl here; odds are she&rsquo;ll turn out to be just like her parents.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those parents were quite old too, especially for Africans, almost 60, not young confused parents who don&rsquo;t know what to do, which is often the case with very young parents. These parents should know better.  If they don&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;re hopeless.</p>
<p>And, as cicio said, just get the irony in importing refugees from Liberia! We founded that country as  a homeland that we could repatriate blacks TO, not that we could import them FROM!</p>
