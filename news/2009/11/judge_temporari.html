<h1>Order Bars Retiring Nickname Until After Hearing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dale Wetzel, Grand Forks Herald (North Dakota), November 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A judge is barring the state Board of Higher Education from doing away with the University of North Dakota&rsquo;s Fighting Sioux nickname until after a Dec. 9 hearing.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s order from Judge Michael Sturdevant of Bottineau is in response to a lawsuit filed by nickname supporters from the Spirit Lake reservation.</p>
<p>The group says the board would be ignoring the rights of the Sioux people if it retires the nickname at its meeting next week.</p>
<p>As part of a legal settlement with the NCAA, the state board agreed to drop the nickname and Indian head logo unless it gets an agreement from the Standing Rock and Spirit Lake Sioux tribes to keep using them.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/26728/group/home/">ND Board May Challenge Fighting Sioux Ruling</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Dale Wetzel, WDAY AM (Fargo), November 10, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The president of North Dakota&rsquo;s Board of Higher Education said Tuesday he will talk with the attorney general about challenging a judge&rsquo;s order that temporarily prohibits changing the University of North Dakota&rsquo;s Fighting Sioux nickname.</p>
<p>The edict issued Monday could delay UND&rsquo;s efforts to join the Summit League in sports and re-establish its football rivalry with North Dakota State University, board President Richie Smith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, there are some monetary implications here,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Every day that UND has to wait, it costs them money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sports scheduling is usually done years in advance. The Summit League has not wanted to take on UND as a member until the dispute about its nickname, which the NCAA regards as hostile and abusive, is settled.</p>
<p>Northeast District Judge Michael Sturdevant issued a temporary restraining order Monday that bars the Board of Higher Education from changing the nickname. The board had been expected to discuss the issue at a Nov. 19 meeting at Minot State University.</p>
<p>Sturdevant&rsquo;s ruling came after a lawsuit was filed last week by eight Spirit Lake Sioux tribal members who support the nickname. The judge scheduled a Dec. 9 hearing on it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dispute has its origins in the NCAA&rsquo;s August 2005 declaration that UND&rsquo;s Fighting Sioux nickname and Indian head logo are hostile to American Indians and should be abolished.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an October 2007 settlement, the board was given until Nov. 30, 2010, to gain support for the nickname and logo from the Standing Rock or Spirit Lake Sioux tribes. UND then has until Aug. 15, 2011, to find a new nickname and logo.</p>
<p>An April 2009 referendum on the Spirit Lake Sioux reservation showed overwhelming support for the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo. The tribe&rsquo;s governing council subsequently approved a resolution giving UND &#8220;perpetual&#8221; permission to use them.</p>
<p>The Standing Rock Sioux tribal council has opposed the nickname and logo, and no referendum has been scheduled. Its newly elected chairman, Charles Murphy, said in a letter to William Goetz, chancellor of the state university system, that the tribe was willing to discuss the issue &#8220;without deadlines or stipulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Board of Higher Education has demanded that the tribes give UND their permission to use the nickname and logo for at least 30 years. Tribal council resolutions of support are not enough, because a newly elected council could change them, board members say.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they go ahead and drop the Fighting Sioux name, then rename the team the Fighting Norsemen? Before the Norse and kindred settlers arrived, North Dakota was home to a few thousand primitive hunter-gatherers. The northern European population made North Dakota into what it is today.</p>

		<p>As David Yeagley would tell you, people chose the name &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221; for their team because they recognized the warrior spirit of the Sioux and wanted some of that spirit to rub off on their sportsmen.  It takes a liberal to assume that the Sioux people would object to this.  I never heard an Irishman complain that Notre Dame&rsquo;s team is called the Fighting Irish. (For the same reason we named an attack helicopter the Apache   &mdash;   it wouldn&rsquo;t have been named after any wimp tribe.)<br>

I&rsquo;ve never understood the issue.</p>
<p>We name our teams (or used to) after people who were great fighters. It always seemed to me that naming a team after Native Americans was an honor; an acknowledgment that these people could put up a good fight (and win).</p>
<p>I have to believe that when a team with a name such as the Fighting Sioux wins, the fans relish in the pride of the name.</p>

		<p>Fighting Norsemen sounds excellent!</p>
<p>It seems likely that the one tribe is lookng for some bucks.  Apparenthy the one way for a college to keep an Indian mascot name is to find a local Indian tribe that approves.  And the way to get them to approve is to offer them a large amount of money, under the table.  I heard this was how the University of Florida &#8220;Seminoles&#8221; got to keep their name.  </p>

		<p>Drop the &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221;. Eliminate every indian name from everything. Make them vanish from history, from memory, and ultimately from relevance. Would the Native American/Indian tribes prefer that?  Will that bring them happiness? </p>
<p> Why is making their mascot, a proud and revered icon, supposedly offensive? I dont get it. </p>
<p> I would offer that on behalf of us pasty white males, they adopt the mascot &#8220;The Intellectually Superior Caucasians&#8221;&hellip; is that better? How about &#8220;The Fighting Nerds&#8221; for some engineering school?  I am fine with either. Ill even buy a jersey and come to the games! I happen to know that North Dakota is chock full of my pale bretheren, many more of them than native americans. Anything where we can show some tangible white pride would be a Godsend! We already have the &#8220;Fighting Whities&#8221; In colorado, but I would like to see even more white pride mascots, honestly. </p>
<p> The native american crowd works SO hard to be offended, and misses the concept that the sious/apache/illini/seminole mascots are seen as positive and respected mascots. If they have their way, in  a generation no one will know what  a sioux or apache is&hellip; nor will they care. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the Amerind tribes that are complaining about these mascots  &mdash;  as usual, it&rsquo;s idiot liberals.</p>
<p>Of course, the Politically Correct anti-racists are the worst of them all  &mdash;  and here again it shows.  (They don&rsquo;t just hate Whites  &mdash;  I wonder if there is really ANY group they DON&rsquo;T hate?)</p>
<p>Indeed, in this case, the local Indian tribe is suing the board demanding the University of North Dakota KEEP the &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221; nickname  &mdash;  a nickname that the idiot liberals in the NCAA don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Political Correctness:  the stupid, it burns!<br>
