<h1>Obama, House Dems Press for Health Care Votes</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama met at the White House with several Hispanic lawmakers who oppose any prohibition on the ability of illegal immigrants to use their own money to purchase health coverage in a new government-run marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;He listened to us. We listened to him,&#8221; said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. &#8220;We made it very clear that 20 votes in the Hispanic caucus&#8221; depend on the language in the House bill. Currently, there is no prohibition in the House bill against illegal immigrants buying insurance in the exchange, but the White House backs such a ban and one exists in the Senate bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that he got our message,&#8221; Velazquez said.</p>
<p>House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said later that she did not believe there would be any change to the House bill on immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democratic opponents of abortion  &mdash;  under pressure from Catholic bishops  &mdash;  want stronger provisions written in the bill that no federal funds would be used to finance abortion in coverage bought in the government-run exchange.</p>
<p>Language being circulated by one anti-abortion Democrat, Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana, seemed likely to be the basis for an agreement. Ellsworth&rsquo;s language aims to strengthen stipulations already in the bill against federal money being used to pay for abortions. It would still allow people to pay for abortion coverage with their own money.</p>
<p>The language was still being negotiated late Thursday, but Slaughter said she expected it to be included in the bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Democrats were coalescing, so were their opponents. Thousands of conservatives rallied outside the Capitol on Thursday, chanting &#8220;Kill the bill!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the first time, almost all individuals would be required to purchase insurance or pay a fine, and employers would be required to insure their employees. Insurance companies would be barred from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions or charging much higher rates to older people.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic Caucus: Illegals had better be able to take part or they vote &ldquo;no.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start a campaign to get as many Europeans as we can to migrate right now, letting them know they&rsquo;ll be given amnesty, free health care and welfare.</p>
<p>It would be quite a joke if we could get about five million of them to settle along the southern border.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to offset mestizo numbers, but it would put a big hurt on their ability to automatically vote their representatives in.</p>

		<p>Illegals current abuse the guarantee of emergency care.</p>
<p>I say, REQUIRE them to purchase the universal policy or be deported.<br/>
And REQUIRE anyone who employs illegals to provide the coverage other employers do.<br/>
And if you hire someone from a day-labor site, check that they have their insurance card or YOU pay one-months premium for them.</p>

		<p>Illegals can&rsquo;t take part, because illegal aliens are in the country illegally. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a circular argument. Circular arguments outline the absurdity of some situations, absurd because they shouldn&rsquo;t even be an argument  &mdash;  like the administration totally ignoring existing immigration law, for example.</p>

		<p>We have got to get over some of this petty stuff. Some of us are anti-abortion, some of us are pro-choice. Some of us are pro capital punishment, some anti. Some for rights of gays, some anti.<br/>
The point is, that we have to act as race realists. This means accepting differences of opinion on unrelated matters and focusing on the interests of White society. To do otherwise is to divert attention from the important matter at hand.</p>

		<p>Obama couldn&rsquo;t care less about everybody having healthcare  &mdash;    &mdash;  only every black.  And it is for the advancement of blacks he is so fantically obssessed to get this bill passed.</p>
<p>Make no mistake of that.  Do not regard the above statement lightly, because it is unequivocally true.</p>
<p>The House passed the bill last night.  If the Senate does the same, it will eventually be revealed that contained therein are many mandates that are designed SOLELY TO ADVANCE BLACKS.  For example there&rsquo;s a clause that dictates so many non-whites will have to be accepted to med schools instead of whites.  There will be far fewer qualified white doctors and FAR MORE unqualified black and Hispanic ones in the near future, because of this inclusion which has received zero publicity.  Many more provisions are non-white oriented also.</p>
<p>It is indeed a dark day for the American Empire.  It is one step closer to oblivion, and that is not a &#8220;sour grapes&#8221; assessment, it is absolute fact.</p>
<p>When the &#8220;Cap and Trade&#8221; legislation passes, it will be the coup de grace.  If it doesn&rsquo;t pass, we will still be on the road to Hell.  It will just take us a couple more years to get there.</p>
<p>If you are still in doubt, just wait and see how things develop.  It&rsquo;s only going to take less than five years.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused&hellip;. So the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wants to allow law breakers the right to purchase health care as if they were here legally? Aren&rsquo;t those same lawmakers sworn to uphold the laws of the land? They clearly choose their kinship with their ethnic kinsmen over loyalty to the nation. Why are they allowed to serve in Congress? They should be arrested, impeached at least.</p>
<p>This is no less than amnesty by proxy. Once the illegals are in the system through healthcare, what is to prevent them from asserting other rights? I can hear the ACLU lawyers now: My client paid for healthcare and thus to remove him/her from the country would violate his/her rights under the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, blahblahblah Amendments. The thing would be stuck in court for decades while the &#8220;client&#8221; lives free and clear of any threat of deportation. He&rsquo;s paid to stay, after all.</p>

		<p>@5  You are spot on but you forgot the millions of bureaucrats that will be mostly black holding high paying position payed by white taxpayers.</p>
<p>America is slowly sliding into black rule like South Africa.</p>
<p>Russia is the only true white nation still standing.<br/>
