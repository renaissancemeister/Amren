<p>America&rsquo;s churches always reflect shifts in the broader culture, and Casa del Padre is no exception. The message that Jesus blesses believers with riches first showed up in the postwar years, at a time when Americans began to believe that greater comfort could be accessible to everyone, not just the landed class. But it really took off during the boom years of the 1990s, and has continued to spread ever since. This stitched-together, homegrown theology, known as the prosperity gospel, is not a clearly defined denomination, but a strain of belief that runs through the Pentecostal Church and a surprising number of mainstream evangelical churches, with varying degrees of intensity. In [Fernando] Garay&rsquo;s church [Casa del Padre], God is the &#8220;Owner of All the Silver and Gold,&#8221; and with enough faith, any believer can access the inheritance. Money is not the dull stuff of hourly wages and bank-account statements, but a magical substance that comes as a gift from above. Even in these hard times, it is discouraged, in such churches, to fall into despair about the things you cannot afford. &#8220;Instead of saying &#8216;I&rsquo;m poor,&rsquo; say &#8216;I&rsquo;m rich,&rsquo;&#8221; Garay&rsquo;s wife, Hazael, told me one day. &#8220;The word of God will manifest itself in reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many explanations have been offered for the housing bubble and subsequent crash: interest rates were too low; regulation failed; rising real-estate prices induced a sort of temporary insanity in America&rsquo;s middle class. But there is one explanation that speaks to a lasting and fundamental shift in American culture  &mdash;  a shift in the American conception of divine Providence and its relationship to wealth.</p>
<p>In his book Something for Nothing, Jackson Lears describes two starkly different manifestations of the American dream, each intertwined with religious faith. The traditional Protestant hero is a self-made man. He is disciplined and hardworking, and believes that his &#8220;success comes through careful cultivation of (implicitly Protestant) virtues in cooperation with a Providential plan.&#8221; The hero of the second American narrative is a kind of gambling man  &mdash;  a &#8220;speculative confidence man,&#8221; Lears calls him, who prefers &#8220;risky ventures in real estate,&#8221; and a more &#8220;fluid, mobile democracy.&#8221; The self-made man imagines a coherent universe where earthly rewards match merits. The confidence man lives in a culture of chance, with &#8220;grace as a kind of spiritual luck, a free gift from God.&#8221; The Gilded Age launched the myth of the self-made man, as the Rockefellers and other powerful men in the pews connected their wealth to their own virtue. In these boom-and-crash years, the more reckless alter ego dominates. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among Latinos the prosperity gospel has been spreading rapidly. In a recent Pew survey, 73 percent of all religious Latinos in the United States agreed with the statement: &#8220;God will grant financial success to all believers who have enough faith.&#8221; For a generation of poor and striving Latino immigrants, the gospel seems to offer a road map to affluence and modern living. Garay&rsquo;s church is comprised mostly of first-generation immigrants. More than others I&rsquo;ve visited, it echoes back a highly distilled, unself-conscious version of the current thinking on what it means to live the American dream.</p>
<p>One other thing makes Garay&rsquo;s church a compelling case study. From 2001 to 2007, while he was building his church, Garay was also a loan officer at two different mortgage companies. He was hired explicitly to reach out to the city&rsquo;s growing Latino community, and Latinos, as it happened, were disproportionately likely to take out the sort of risky loans that later led to so many foreclosures. To many of his parishioners, Garay was not just a spiritual adviser, but a financial one as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But since that time, the movement has made itself over, moving out of the fringe and into the upwardly mobile megachurch class. In the past decade, it has produced about a dozen celebrity pastors, who show up at White House events, on secular radio, and as guests on major TV talk shows. Kirbyjon Caldwell, a Methodist megapastor in Houston and a purveyor of the prosperity gospel, gave the benediction at both of George W. Bush&rsquo;s inaugurals. Instead of shiny robes or gaudy jewelry, these preachers wear Italian suits and modest wedding bands. Instead of screaming and sweating, they smile broadly and speak in soothing, therapeutic terms. But their message is essentially the same. &#8220;Every day, you&rsquo;re going to live that abundant life!&#8221; preaches Joel Osteen, a best-selling author, the nation&rsquo;s most popular TV preacher, and the pastor of Lakewood Church, in Houston, the country&rsquo;s largest church by far.</p>
<p>Among mainstream, nondenominational megachurches, where much of American religious life takes place, &#8220;prosperity is proliferating&#8221; rapidly, says Kate Bowler, a doctoral candidate at Duke University and an expert in the gospel. Few, if any, of these churches have prosperity in their title or mission statement, but Bowler has analyzed their sermons and teachings. Of the nation&rsquo;s 12 largest churches, she says, three are prosperity  &mdash;  Osteen&rsquo;s, which dwarfs all the other megachurches; Tommy Barnett&rsquo;s, in Phoenix; and T. D. Jakes&rsquo;s, in Dallas. In second-tier churches  &mdash;  those with about 5,000 members  &mdash;  the prosperity gospel dominates. Overall, Bowler classifies 50 of the largest 260 churches in the U.S. as prosperity. The doctrine has become popular with Americans of every background and ethnicity; overall, Pew found that 66 percent of all Pentecostals and 43 percent of &#8220;other Christians&#8221;  &mdash;  a category comprising roughly half of all respondents  &mdash;  believe that wealth will be granted to the faithful. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Theologically, the prosperity gospel has always infuriated many mainstream evangelical pastors. Rick Warren, whose book The Purpose Driven Life outsold Osteen&rsquo;s [Your Best Life Now, by Joel Osteen], told Time, &#8220;This idea that God wants everybody to be wealthy? There is a word for that: baloney. It&rsquo;s creating a false idol. You don&rsquo;t measure your self-worth by your net worth. I can show you millions of faithful followers of Christ who live in poverty. Why isn&rsquo;t everyone in the church a millionaire?&#8221; In 2005, a group of African American pastors met to denounce prosperity megapreachers for promoting a Jesus who is more like a &#8220;cosmic bellhop,&#8221; as one pastor put it, than the engaged Jesus of the civil-rights era who looked after the poor.</p>
<p>More recently, critics have begun to argue that the prosperity gospel, echoed in churches across the country, might have played a part in the economic collapse. In 2008, in the online magazine Religion Dispatches, Jonathan Walton, a professor of religious studies at the University of California at Riverside, warned:<blockquote>Narratives of how &#8220;God blessed me with my first house despite my credit&#8221; were common.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sermons declaring &#8220;It&rsquo;s your season of overflow&#8221; supplanted messages of economic sobriety and disinterested sacrifice. Yet as folks were testifying about &#8220;what God can do,&#8221; little attention was paid to a predatory subprime-mortgage industry, relaxed credit standards, or the dangers of using one&rsquo;s home equity as an ATM.<br>
</blockquote>In 2004, Walton was researching a book about black televangelists. &#8220;I would hear consistent testimonies about how &#8216;once I was renting and now God let me own my own home,&rsquo; or &#8216;I was afraid of the loan officer, but God directed him to ignore my bad credit and blessed me with my first home,&rsquo;&#8221; he says. &#8220;This trope was so common in these churches that I just became immune to it. Only later did I connect it to this disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demographically, the growth of the prosperity gospel tracks fairly closely to the pattern of foreclosure hot spots. Both spread in two particular kinds of communities  &mdash;  the exurban middle class and the urban poor. Many newer prosperity churches popped up around fringe suburban developments built in the 1990s and 2000s, says Walton. These are precisely the kinds of neighborhoods that have been decimated by foreclosures, according to Eric Halperin, of the Center for Responsible Lending.</p>
<p>Zooming out a bit, Kate Bowler found that most new prosperity-gospel churches were built along the Sun Belt, particularly in California, Florida, and Arizona  &mdash;  all areas that were hard-hit by the mortgage crisis. Bowler, who, like Walton, was researching a book, spent a lot of time attending the &#8220;financial empowerment&#8221; seminars that are common at prosperity churches. Advisers would pay lip service to &#8220;sound financial practices,&#8221; she recalls, but overall they would send the opposite message: posters advertising the seminars featured big houses in the background, and the parking spots closest to the church were reserved for luxury cars.</p>
<p>Nationally, the prosperity gospel has spread exponentially among African American and Latino congregations. This is also the other distinct pattern of foreclosures. &#8220;Hyper-segregated&#8221; urban communities were the worst off, says Halperin. Reliable data on foreclosures by race are not publicly available, but mortgages are tracked by both race and loan type, and subprime loans have tended to correspond to foreclosures. During the boom, roughly 40 percent of all loans going to Latinos nationwide were subprime loans; Latinos and African Americans were 28 percent and 37 percent more likely, respectively, to receive a higher-rate subprime loan than whites.</p>
<p>In June, the Supreme Court ruled that state attorneys general had the authority to sue national banks for predatory lending. Even before that ruling, at least 17 lawsuits accusing various banks of treating racial minorities unfairly were already under way. (Bank of America&rsquo;s Countrywide division  &mdash;  one of the companies Garay worked for  &mdash;  had earlier agreed to pay $8.4 billion in a multistate settlement.) One theme emerging in these suits is how banks teamed up with pastors to win over new customers for subprime loans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea of reaching out to churches took off quickly, Jacobson [Beth Jacobson,a star witness for the City of Baltimore&rsquo;s recent suit against Wells Fargo] recalls. The branch managers figured pastors had a lot of influence with their parishioners and could give the loan officers credibility and new customers. Jacobson remembers a conference call where sales managers discussed the new strategy. The plan was to send officers to guest-speak at church-sponsored &#8220;wealth-building seminars&#8221; like the ones Bowler attended, and dazzle the participants with the possibility of a new house. They would tell pastors that for every person who took out a mortgage, $350 would be donated to the church, or to a charity of the parishioner&rsquo;s choice. &#8220;They wouldn&rsquo;t say, &#8216;Hey, Mr. Minister. We want to give your people a bunch of subprime loans,&#8221; Jacobson told me. &#8220;They would say, &#8216;Your congregants will be homeowners! They will be able to live the American dream!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I asked Garay why his parishioner Billy Gonzales, who earns barely $25,000 and has no money to fix his car, should donate 10 percent of his income. &#8220;Because it gives him a new mentality. It teaches him that money can breed more money, that you can have money in your pocket on Saturday morning even though you got paid Friday night. People who support the church week after week have a dedication. Those who just give $5 or $10 here and there, you&rsquo;ll hear them have the same problems week after week.&#8221; Jackson Lears would add another explanation: tithing is like the moment the gambler lays his money down on the table  &mdash;  it &#8220;promises at least a fleeting opportunity to contact a realm where hope is alive,&#8221; he writes. Without it, there&rsquo;s only the dull regularity of $2,000 a month and a dead car.</p>
<p>During the boom years, Apostle Garay, as he is known in church, was brasher than he is now. He spoke in very specific terms during church services, promising that a $100 offering would yield a $10,000 return: &#8220;This is not my promise. It is God&rsquo;s promise, and he will make it happen!&#8221; he would say.</p>
<p>While it sounds absurd, this kind of message can have a positive influence, according to Tony Tian-Ren Lin, a researcher at the University of Virginia who has made a close study of Latino prosperity gospel congregations over the years. These churches typically take in people who had &#8220;been basically dropped into the world from pretty primitive settings&#8221;  &mdash;  small towns in Latin America with no electricity or running water and very little educational opportunity. In their new congregation, their pastor slowly walks them through life in the U.S., both inside and outside of church, until they become more confident. &#8220;In Mexico, nobody ever told them they could do anything,&#8221; says Lin, who was himself raised in Argentina. He finds the message at prosperity churches to be quintessentially American. &#8220;They are taught they can do absolutely anything, and it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will. They become part of the elect, the chosen. They get swept up in the manifest destiny, this idea that God has lifted Americans above everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Casa del Padre, the celebration of consumer culture is quite visible, along with a sense of boundless opportunity. The people in the church, for instance, tend to have very expensive cell phones  &mdash;  never the free ones that come with a calling plan, nor the sort that can be bought cheaply at a convenience store. &#8220;They start wanting what&rsquo;s considered the best and the most technologically advanced in this country,&#8221; Lin says. Garay&rsquo;s church, it seems to me, teaches them that they deserve these things, so they go about getting them, with few resources and infinite adaptability. Before the crash, one group of young men got a $12,000 loan to start a landscaping company; another man bought a $270,000 house. One of the church&rsquo;s Bible-study leaders, who&rsquo;d grown up in a remote village in Mexico with an abusive, alcoholic father, had become a very successful contractor by the height of the boom, managing 30 men on multiple jobs and winning contracts to paint luxury subdivisions in the exurbs.</p>
<p>The tenets of the prosperity gospel, and the practical advice that pastors often give their parishioners, help immigrants learn &#8220;not just how to survive but how to thrive; not just live paycheck to paycheck but handle money  &mdash;  manage complicated payrolls, invest in equipment,&#8221; Lin told me. Along the way, they become assimilated. &#8220;While they&rsquo;re trying to be closer to God, instead they become American,&#8221; he says, from their optimism and entrepreneurialism to the very nature of their dreams.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like much of Garay&rsquo;s advice, this recommendation is partly grounded in economic reality, and partly drawn from mystical notions about a biblical calendar. &#8220;I&rsquo;m very real,&#8221; he once told me. &#8220;If you want to eat at Red Lobster, you better have a Red Lobster paycheck, and enough left over to pay your electric bill. But I&rsquo;ve also seen miracles of God.&#8221; Later, during one of our talks over coffee, his wife echoed the sentiment. &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t afford a house, you shouldn&rsquo;t buy it,&#8221; Hazael said, when I asked whether the prosperity gospel might push people to take irresponsible risks. &#8220;But if the Lord is telling you to &#8216;take that first step and I will provide,&rsquo; then you have to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is not all that surprising that the prosperity gospel persists despite its obvious failure to pay off. {snip}</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, Christianity does not guarantee an individual believer great riches, nor does it ordain an economic system for a given nation.  What it does say near the end is not to put words in God&rsquo;s mouth, not to take words out.  I think these preachers (as you can read, mostly black and Hispanic) are doing just that.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of thing that represents the complete failure of our news media.  While the housing boom (and first stages of bust) were going on, minority hucksters were using ethnic affinity to con their brethren into bad mortgage deals that generated high fees.  But did any news organization run a story<br>
&#8221; Poseurs Exploit Ethic Trust in Affinity Mortgage Scams&#8221;?  Of course not.</p>
<p>And now that the thing is seen as the exploitation it was, the only bad guys they can identify are &#8220;Wall Street,&#8221; meaning whites.  They DID play a role.  But without the cooperation of the minorities mortgage brokers, they could never have gotten the trust of the marks.</p>

		<p>The news media refuses to acknowledge that the crash resulted from the entitlements mentality of the blacks, and the willing enablement of Congress in mandating lending policies on banks and lenders which forced them to make loans to people who had lousy credit histories.  So what does the news media do?  They blame Christianity while obscuring the REAL causes of our high taxes, failing banks, a black society refusing any responsibility for anything - Congress and the blacks.<br>
The Prosperity Gospel is NOT Christianity.  It is a false doctrine preached by false prophets and is merely a sign of the times and the great falling away predicted.  But, of course, the media would not write that.  They&rsquo;d prefer to continue their assault on the ONE thing which defined the white race, and made it successful as opposed to every other race.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Prosperity Gospel&#8221; is NOT new.  It came into its own in the late 1800&rsquo;s and lasted strongly through the 1970&rsquo;s.  It was a product of the socalled New Thought Churches - Religious Science, Unity, Divine Science, etc.  Unity in particular has a number of books published that deal specifically with prosperity as a natural result of aligning oneself with divine law.  What has happened is that the more traditional Protestant churches have more recently discovered the prosperity teachings, and have adapted them for their own use.  I know this stuff because I&rsquo;m an ordained Unity minister - we literally wrote the book on it.  And where was Rev. Ike in the above article?  He was VERY big on the prosperity front, back in the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.  The thing is, one has to develop a spiritual CONSCIOUSNESS before the laws of Prosperity can work for one.  Catherine Ponder is one of the best prosperity teachers, and her books are readily available.</p>

		<p>well, well  &mdash;  who is the real Jesus?</p>
<p>Is it even possible to know?</p>
<p>Actually, I can see how certain verses can be used to support the &#8220;prosperity gospel.&#8221; I can also see how certain verses can be used to support &#8220;poverty&#8221; as a blessed state, meant for all true believers. The Bible can be used to justify many positions, some of which seem contradictory.</p>
<p>But look how Christianity has beocme a comic-book religion! What a fall, what a glorious fall!</p>
<p>Even today, I received in the mail a catalog from a &#8220;family-values&#8221; Christian outfit. It showed little boys dressed as knights and such. This did not come from Christianity  &mdash;  it came from our European heritage. Christianity teaches absolute pacifism.</p>
<p>That which many people like in Christianity, the Catholic or Protestant versions, came from Europe and &#8220;Germanic&#8221; values.   </p>

		<p>What a misleading title! The TRUE Christianity did not cause it! The HI-JACKERS of Christianity caused it along with the enemies in our government and International bankers! One more thing they lay at the feet of Christianity to fool the masses. Of course there are stupid Christians out there that buy this shuck n&rsquo;jive from the phoney &#8220;preachers&#8221;. They are nothing but greedy, dishonest little you know whats.</p>

		<p>If you give a child a gun and he shoots someone, is it the child&rsquo;s fault or yours for giving it to him?  Minorities, particularly blacks, have had a long colorful history of not paying their bills going back decades.  The whole subprime mess and the relaxing of lending standards was engineered for the specific purpose of crashing the economy.  There are religious overtones in these kind of practices but they aren&rsquo;t Christian in nature.</p>

		<p>unfortunately, this toxic teaching has made inroads into Africa and Latin America. A good example of this is a pastor and his wife of a Brazilian megachurch was arrested in Miami for trying to bring in a child&rsquo;s backpack filled with 10k in cash. Brazil wanted them extradicted for money laundering but the US refused to extradict them because money laundering was not listed as a crime that would allow extradiction. They spent a few months in their home in Miami and then were allowed to return to Brazil.</p>

		<p>I would rather have Christians out there making money, moving things around in the world, making things happen, rather than Muslims or the tattooed crowd. Besides, they say a rising tide lifts all boats. If Prosperity gospel inspires a greater role in the business world, and out in the community, with no shame attached, that&rsquo;s not a bad thing is it?  </p>

		<p>I grew up in Pentecostalism, a branch of Christianity in which the Prosperity Gospel thrives. An interesting thing about Pentecostalism is that many Pentecostal churches became racially integrated even before the schools did. In fact, a cornerstone event in Pentecostalism is something known as the &#8220;Azusa Street Revival&#8221; in which a massive response to Christianity took place, which was mostly known for its radical, ecstatic worship style. The Azusa Street Revival, named after the street in Los Angeles where it began, was sparked by a black minister named William J. Seymour. Wikipedia has an interesting article about it. </p>
<p>Today, the Prosperity Gospel is as controversial within Christianity as the new style of worship was during the days of the Azusa Street revival. Although many prominent white ministers preach this strain of Christianity also, many of its biggest proponents are black ministers. There are a lot of video clips that can be found of black ministers boasting of their material possessions. One in particular is also known for his promotion of hip hop music in churches. </p>
<p>As a former member of several churches which wholeheartedly embraced the prosperity gospel, I can attest that a major problem members of these churches experience is living above their means, often resulting in the repossession of their houses and cars. </p>
<p>If you have not grown up in an environment where the amassing of material possessions is a major part of your belief system - and Pentecostalism is an extremely popular branch of Christianity - you might find the assertion made by this article far-fetched. I can assure you it is not. </p>

		<p>At a blue light special a sober mind can see the untutored psyche of the average consumer revealed. The innocence of adults behaving like overzealous children with hopes of quick gain is charming on one hand but can be purely evil the next moment. The true meaning of religion is to become whole or centered in God. Religion is the most profound subject there is and its hard to know whether to laugh, cry or have awe when observing ourselves as humans. As humans we are born into a bizarre prediciment, ..we can see we are at the top of the food chain and thus must take ourselves seriously yet over and over again we blunder in awkward attempts at being our best. An obvious observation is that we are born with brains and as well this universe operates on inherant ideas or reasons or laws. The mistake that religious cults have in common is a cancerous amount of emotions impinging on the faculty of reason. People in need, grouped together in large numbers no doubt have often been hell to themselves or others when gullible and misguided whether Jonestown or the Third Reich. As I see it Christianity must have a healthy intellectual infrastructure along with viril members in order fullfill its true destiny, whatever that is&hellip;</p>

		<p>The Gospel does not teach a properity message. Jesus said that his followers would be persecuted. All of the disciples died a martyrs death except John. But, he was exiled to the Isle of Patmos (where he wrote Revelations). Paul was beheaded. As was John the Baptist. The early Christians were very much persecuted. Fed to the Lions etc. <br>
That it has become a prosperity Gospel would have surprised the original Christians.<br>
But, I dare say the White churches started it and there is a problem with it today in the White Church. Not quite the problem it is in the black church or Hispanic church&hellip;but a real problem.I think it goes hand in hand with the everybody is equal problem in church today also.  </p>

<p>Yes and no. The new age/metaphysical belief systems that subscribe to prosperity do it through visualization and positive thinking type excercises more closely related to magical practices. It has to do with channeling energy and is not a gift from God because he likes you.</p>
<p>The Christian prosperity churches state if you give money to the church/minister you will become wealthy in return. We have a bunch of those preachers in Atlanta, the most notable is a black preacher named Creflo Dollar (no doubt his real name and not a made up acronym&hellip;lol). Yup he has a Rolls Royce, Lear Jet, and huge mansion.</p>

		<p>I was a mortgage loan processor for a mortgage broker who had an ethnicallly varied lending staff (50% Asian, 20% white, 20% black and 10% Hispanic). The loan applications have the demographic section (got news for you, if you refused to offer the information, you were almost always white) and here is what I noticed when comparing that section to the good faith estimate (the breakdown of the costs for those in Rio Linda):</p>
<p>The black and hispanic loan officers charged the highest fees for their predominantly black and Hispanic clientele. </p>
<p>In fact they would ask me to check with the lender to see how much could be charged before the loan became  predatory. When I found out, I was told regularly to charge up to a $1 less than the predatory category. </p>
<p>The Asian were next but many of them varied, usually the older established loan officers charged less than newer loan officers. </p>
<p>The Whites charge the fairest amounts, because they seemed to realize that you do not help a borrower by gouging them and because they seemed to have the broadest base of clients.</p>
<p>The blacks and Hispanics never seem to know when or where they&rsquo;d get their next client so they &#8220;maximized their earnings&#8221; </p>

		<p>Nowhere in the Bible do Jesus or the apostles tell poor people that praying will turn them into millionaires. These Elmer Gantry-types are distorting the gospel to ca$h in.</p>
<p>That being said, the crash of the housing bubble had less to do w/Rev. Ike and more to do w/the Federal Reserve (whose insanely low interest rates inflated the bubble in the first place) and the Clinton and Dubya administrations (who forced banks to give risky home loans to blacks and hispanics so they would have &#8216;equal&#8221; homeownership rates with whites).    </p>

		<p>Like all false doctrines, properity gospel has an element of truth.  </p>
<p>The Bible says vastly more about money, personal finances and economics than about practically any other subject.  The theology is not black and white.  There is no formulaic outcome.  A larger principle applies, all things being equal, that God works his will in each believer for the good of the believer.</p>
<p>The Book of Ecclesiastees is a good place to start.</p>

		<p>This modern prosperity gospel teaches the more you give to slick televangelists and storefront preachers the more God will bless you. The wolves in sheeps clothing that practice it are taking scripture out of context for the purpose of exploiting and profiting off ignorant people. Jesus provided the example they don&rsquo;t follow. Jesus gave his life for his flock. He never exploited them.</p>

		<p>No matter how much black and brown preachers pushed the gospel of prosperity their congregation couldn&rsquo;t have gotten such loans 30 years ago.  This bust was caused by Liberals who pushed economic institutions into making these bad loans for reasons of racial politics, it is a matter of hard policy that was protected by the left even after it became obvious that there was a problem.   The author makes no effort to determine how many of these loans went to churchgoers whose pastors preach this gospel, most blacks and browns don&rsquo;t even go to church, and to hone in on the minor influence of this prosperity gospel while ignoring the rest of the vast spectrum of liberal influence, from Affirmative Action, to the false esteem programs aimed at non-whites, to the hard policies put in place by Liberals to ensure this money flowed to non-whites, smacks of straight out Christian-hating bigotry.   </p>

		<p>All religions are busnesses, however they are alleged to have begun and you may find among them the most prosperous of any society, even when the religion is communism.  One thing that remains constant is that those who simply seek a simple, uncomplicated life are always used and abused.</p>
<p>In this country, any recognized religious organization does not have to pay taxes.  I can&rsquo;t think of a condition more attractive to scammers than that.  Since the 4th century, the scammers, having created a religion of psychological blackmail to enrich themselves at the cost of the common people.  They may promise riches in heaven, but they are all about money and power on earth, make no mistake.</p>

		<p>The problem is that there are two theological traps at either end of the spectrum that must be avoided.  The first is the view that poverty is holy and glorious and wealth is evil.  The second is that poverty is the result of a lack of faith and wealth is a sign of God&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>The reality is that following God&rsquo;s law, that is, abstaining from sex outside of marriage, avoiding divorce, and applying your talents to serve God generally will bring most people some measure of material wellbeing, though a sickness or other disaster can easily undo a lifetime of virtue and leave a person destitute.  That is why God calls us to compassion and charity and exhorts us to respect the dignity of the poor.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church sometimes takes this a bit too far and seems to glorify poverty.  Of course if God wants us to be poor, then it could be argued that He is, as Neitzsche charged, mean-spirited and anti-human.  But on the other hand, the Protestant prosperity gospel can also be taken to excesses, and I don&rsquo;t find it hard to believe that it may have contributed to the irrational exuberance we saw in housing this past decade.</p>
<p>If you get approved for a mortgage for a big house, a prosperity preacher might say that to reject it is to show a lack of faith that His &#8220;cup runneth over&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Druid,</p>
<p>Why do you say that Christianity teaches &#8220;absolute pacifism&#8221;.  This is false.  Christ Himself did not resist when He was crucified, but that does not mean that Christians are expected to follow his lead.  He also didn&rsquo;t have a wife.  If we all followed his lead, there would be no people left.  Your view is exemplarist.  That is, Christ is the example for us to follow.  That is not mainstream Christianity.  </p>
<p>We are sinners living in a fallen world.  Until Christ returns, there will be violence in the world.  I believe we are obligated to defend ourselves, our families, and other innocents with violence when necessary.  God told Adam that he shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be as one flesh.  To me, being &#8220;one flesh&#8221; entails if nothing else, a duty to defend your wife, with your own life if necessary.  If it doesn&rsquo;t mean that, then what does it mean?</p>

		<p>The prosperity gospel is nothing new. It began in the 1500&rsquo;s with Tetzel offering indulgences for money. This is the same thing today. Parishoners have given material goods to their preachers because they are told that God would bless them 100 fold of what they gave. The sad thing is that when this happens, people lose faith and leave the church. This is probably responsible for the huge turnover in membership in these churches.</p>

<p>I meant that Christianity teaches absolute pacifism in respect to nations. I think that Jesus himself would not object to a man defending his wife or his children with force.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that jiu-jitsu or a non-striking martial art that submits an opponent without real harm would meet Jesus&rsquo; approval, as it does mine. </p>
<p>But Christianity escues nations. I know that the Church is one nation of people, called out of all nations and races, etc. but nations (as I mean the term) have to do with a commonality  &mdash;  usually, or perhaps exclusively,  a commonality of race. </p>
<p>Christianity knows nothing of that. It cares nothing for a commonality of race and a culture evolving from the experience of that race. </p>
<p>Nations wage war to defend their culture, or their turf. Christianity cares very little about either, because all its members have their true home and citizenship in heaven. </p>
<p>However, having said that, I do indeed wish that the Christian view of things had prevailed in the various wars we Christian Whites have been involved in. World war one and two should have never happened. What were two White European Christian nations <br>
doing fighting each other? The result is the absolute depletion of the White race. We are still suffering the effects of each link of the chain of causality that the two world wars effected. </p>
<p>Perhaps I am more than a little disgusted that the Christian view did not prevail, and that the Christian teachings proved to be as strong as tissue paper.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, I do not wish to have an unrealistic view of humankind. But then again, Chrisianity promises great things, does it not?</p>

&#8220;Meanwhile, Christianity does not guarantee an individual believer great riches, nor does it ordain an economic system for a given nation. What it does say near the end is not to put words in God&rsquo;s mouth, not to take words out. I think these preachers (as you can read, mostly black and Hispanic) are doing just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree. In my opinion that&rsquo;s what the Second Commandment means: &#8220;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord the God in vain&#8221;.<br>
Basically, don&rsquo;t use my name as an justification for evil as do Black Preachers, Muslims and other unscrupulous, self proclaimed ministers of the Lord.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Christ did not resist..but that does not mean that we are to follow his lead?&#8221;&hellip; Well then what is a student suposed to do, if not follow the teachers lead? And this principal of Pacifism and the glorification of allowing yourself to be destroyed and humiliated without resisting Evil is the masochistic martyrdom that has enabled so many otherwise pathetic effeminate males to &#8220;seem&#8221; called by God to be leaders of men. The psychosis of glorifying cowardly self betrayal for a reward after death is no small scar on humanity as I see it, especially when on top of this, those who disobey go to eternal flames&hellip;This effeminate interpretation&hellip;that love is all that matters at the cost of dignity, self respect or individuality&hellip; that all people must love all people or go to hell forever is one of the more disgusting ways to rape humanity as I see it. I propose that Jesus allowed himself to be cruxified as an epoc turning point in history according to Gods will in the unfolding of humanity. He was not here to change or go against natural instincts or make our decisions for us but rather something much more singular and on larger scale. His rejection by Gods original effort (covenant) with the Hebrews could only be culminated with the Ultimate form of rejection and thus the perfect rupturing &#8220;Vail torn in two&#8221; He was cruxified as the Door through which future people desiring to know God can enter&hellip;(The new covenant) in place of the old.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you can separate the two.  All wars consist of warriors fighting for their own (extended) families.  Just as we are allowed, indeed required, to prefer our own families to strangers and still be good Christians, so patriotism is also perfectly consistent with Christianity.  Consider what Petrarch says &hellip;</p>
