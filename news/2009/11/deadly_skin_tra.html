<h1><a href="https://www.sphere.com/2009/11/23/deadly-skin-trade-preys-on-african-albinos/">Deadly Skin Trade Preys on African Albinos</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Theunis Bates, Sphere, November 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>East Africa&rsquo;s albinos have long suffered because of the color of their skin. Some are abandoned as babies by parents who regard their lack of pigment as a curse. Many more are subjected to taunts of &#8220;zeru&#8221; (Swahili for ghost) in school and on the street. But now Tanzania and Burundi&rsquo;s 8,000 albinos face a more horrible threat, fueled by a macabre combination of superstition and economics.</p>
<p>Over the past two years  &mdash;  according to a new report from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  &mdash;  at least 56 albinos in the two countries have been murdered, and their body parts used by witch doctors to make charms and potions. The last known killing took place on Oct. 21, when albino hunters attacked 10-year-old Gasper Elikana in northern Tanzania. A gang of men hacked the boy to death in front of his family and neighbors  &mdash;  who were wounded trying to protect the child  &mdash;  before fleeing with his severed leg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s certain is that buyers  &mdash;  most of whom are believed to be Tanzanian  &mdash;  are willing to pay a high price for these horrific charms. Police have reported albino limbs being sold by witch doctors for $200, while a full &#8220;albino kit&#8221;  &mdash;  consisting of limbs, nose, tongue, ears and genitals  &mdash;  costs $75,000. That&rsquo;s an astronomical sum in a country where almost 60% of the population lives on less than $1 a day, and it has led many experts to conclude that the demand for these goods comes from the upper-echelons of Tanzanian society. &#8220;Poor people cannot afford to spend so much money on a little concoction from a witch doctor,&#8221; says the Albinism Society&rsquo;s Mwaura. &#8220;The buyers must be wealthy. They are not even trying to strike it rich, they&rsquo;re trying to strike it richer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under pressure from campaigners at home and abroad, the Tanzanian government has started to crack down on the grim trade. In January, it revoked all traditional healers&rsquo; operating licenses. (Many, however, flouted the ban and continued to trade.) {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite these doubts, there&rsquo;s evidence that this hard-line approach is scaring off some albino hunters. {snip}</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s likely that the region&rsquo;s albinos will only feel truly safe when their black-skinned neighbors regard them as ordinary people and not supernatural beings. &#8220;What&rsquo;s needed is education,&#8221; says Engstrand-Neacsu. &#8220;We need to make people understand what albinism really is. Ignorance is the origin of discrimination. And ignorance has ultimately led to these crimes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The horrific cost of American aid.  They don&rsquo;t have money for food.  But they have money to buy the severed body parts of murder victims to engage in satanism.</p>
<p>Where did that money come from?  Think about that the next time someone tries to get you to send money to &#8220;starving&#8221; people in the third world.</p>
<p>These people aspire to nothing but to get rich by stealing aid money.  But that is only half the story.  The other half is what they do with it once they get their hands on it.</p>
<p>And this is what they choose to do with it.</p>

<p>many of those at the highest levels of Tanzanian society, those with wealth, are also living in the stone age mentally, and not just the lower classes. </p>

		<p>The black psyche in a nutshell.  Blacks hate whites, but blacks have a fetish for white meat, hence why the bucks all pursue white women while hating white men.  The only difference between African blacks and American blacks is that in Africa their savagery goes unpunished and they can be truly themselves.  In America, there are still SOME lines blacks cross that won&rsquo;t go unpunished.  That distinction is getting less and less though.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting point. These &#8220;upper-echelons&#8221; would be the Obama Sr. types of individuals. Raised and educated in white prep private schools and having NOT a pagan background but still susceptible to the root beliefs of their native society. Muti and juju and the influence thereof are hard for the white &#8220;westerner&#8221; to grasp and understand.</p>

<p>This is not Satanism, which requires the Christian God as an enemy/counterpart.  This is African witchcraft, or shamanism.  Remember, Christian communion is symbolic cannibalism.  If you do it symbolically, is it not tantamount to actually doing it?  Not such a big leap here, it seems.</p>
<p>I do agree about the uselessness of any aid to Africa as it just seems to fuel all sorts of corruption and at best, dependency.<br>

<p>That is quite possibly the most ridiculous thing I have ever read on this site.  Your hatred of Christianity is truly destroying your capacity for rational thought.</p>
<p>If to do it symbolically is &#8220;tantamount to actually doing it&#8221;, then I suppose you think that virtually all of your ancestors are cannibals.  Why then would you be proud of being white?</p>

		<p>To sofita:</p>
<p>Whiteplight&rsquo;s statement that the Christian Eucharist is &#8220;symbolic cannibalism&#8221; is not as far-fetched as you think.</p>
<p>Remember this ritual every Sunday?-</p>
<p>&#8220;On the night he was betrayed, he took the bread, gave it to his disciples and said, &#8220;Take this bread and eat from it, all of you, for this is my body. Do this in memory of me&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;When supper was ended, he took the cup. Again he gave you thanks and praise. He gave the cup to his disciples and said, &#8220;Take this cup and drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood, the blood of the everlasting covenant&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Sounds like ritualistic cannibalism to me. I disagree with Whiteplight in that it&rsquo;s NOT tantamount to actually doing it - no more than a man being physically turned on by watching an exotic dancer actually having sex with her.<br>

		<p>@ Sofia,</p>
<p>Hatred of religion has nothing to do with pointing out facts.</p>
<p>It was not offensive, personally, I believe rational thought and religion are quite different from one another.</p>

		<p>Lots of religions and cultures have had cannibalism or human sacrifice as part of their rituals, whether in Europe, the Middle East or Asia. However, they&rsquo;ve advanced beyond that. The Africans have not. In fact, they&rsquo;re regressing. </p>

		<p>In a nutshell, any good Catholic who believes in Transubstantiation is committing cannibalism every time they take Communion.</p>
