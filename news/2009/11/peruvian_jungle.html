<h1>Peruvian Jungle Gang Kills for Body Fat</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newmax, November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A gang in the remote Peruvian jungle has been killing people for their fat, the police said Thursday, accusing the gang&rsquo;s members of draining fat from bodies and selling it on the black market for use in cosmetics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three suspects have confessed to killing five people for their fat, said Col. Jorge Mejía, chief of Peru&rsquo;s anti-kidnapping police. He said the suspects, two of whom were arrested carrying bottles of liquid fat, told the police it was worth $60,000 a gallon.</p>
<p>Colonel Mejía said the suspects had told the police that the fat had been sold to intermediaries in Lima, the capital. While police officials suspect that the fat was sold to cosmetic companies in Europe, he said he could not confirm any sales.</p>
<p>Several medical experts acknowledged that fat had cosmetic uses, but they also said they doubted that there was an international black market for human fat. Dr. Lisa M. Donofrio, a Yale University dermatology professor, speculated that a small market might exist for &#8220;human fat extracts&#8221; to keep skin supple, though she added that scientists considered such treatments &#8220;pure baloney.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Colonel Mejía said Mr. Castillejos [Elmer Segundo Castillejos, one of the suspects] had told officers that the gang would cut off its victims&rsquo; heads, arms and legs, remove the organs, and then suspend the torsos from hooks above candles that warmed the flesh as the fat dripped into tubs below.</p>
<p>Six members of the gang remain at large, he said, adding that in addition to the five killings to which the suspects had confessed, the gang might have been involved in dozens of others. Mr. Castillejos told the police that the band&rsquo;s fugitive leader, Hilario Cudena, had been killing people to extract fat for more than three decades.</p>
<p>At least 60 people are listed as missing this year in Huanuco Province, where the gang is believed to have operated. The province is also home to drug-trafficking leftist rebels.</p>

		<p>These fine Gothick tales should always be treated with a large pinch of salt, but it is certainly true that human corpses CAN be recycled:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Spanner" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Spanner</a></p>
<p>There was a Gothick Horror case in the USA not so long ago which involved body parts being cycled; some of the bones of the late [and very aged] Alistair Cooke were supposedly bought and implanted into unsuspecting recipients. Now, if I were paying for bone, I&rsquo;d insist on getting young bone not the frail old stuff and old wrinkly&rsquo;s body would yield!</p>
<p>Again, not so long ago I was reading though a stack of British and American science magazines [and I cannot remember which magazine had the story] and came across a totally factual account of turkey-processing-plant waste [head and guts and so on] being transformed into low-octane fuel and industrial lubricants.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough well-nourished people have liposuction to provide plenty of the raw material. Extracting fat from corpses in the jungles of Peru sounds like the plot of a low-budget shock-horror video nasty like &#8216;Cannibal Holocaust.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This is nothing more than muti being imported by immigrants from back home.  These are people practicing black magic, which involves using body parts from people who have been murdered.  In this case, they&rsquo;ve been conveniently refined into &#8220;cosmetics&#8221; for use in spells to make the person look better.</p>
<p>Sure, the murderers are evil psychopaths.  But that&rsquo;s not the real problem.  The real problem is the huge market of evil people looking for body parts to use in their black magic rituals.  This is epidemic in africa.  But as we see in the article, these people immigrate to the western world in large numbers.  Our society has now changed to include large numbers of people who pay others to murder people for their body parts so that they can do something sick with it.</p>
<p>This goes waaaaaay beyond a law enforcement issue.</p>

		<p>Well, it IS a new twist, but hardly surprising. (It&rsquo;s very hard to be surprised anymore.) They would have a never-ending supply of body fat if they had some of our welfare recipients. </p>

		<p>Having traveled South of the Border in the past, I know that there is a black market for beauty creams from sources like protected turtle specis, etc.  This is for a cream, not a pill.  I do not necessarily regard this report as a Gothic(k) fiction regardless of its odious report.  Wasnt&rsquo; there just a Discovery program that went looking for  present day head shrinkers in the Amazon and found them?</p>
<p>I will wait for more information.</p>
