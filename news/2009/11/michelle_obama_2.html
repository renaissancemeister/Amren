<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8377922.stm">Michelle Obama Racist Image Sparks Google Apology</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, November 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Google has apologised over a racially offensive picture of Michelle Obama that appeared when users searched for images of the US first lady.</p>
<p>The image came top of the Google Images results for &#8220;Michelle Obama&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google placed a notice over the picture titled &#8220;Offensive Search Results&#8221;, saying: &#8220;Sometimes our search results can be offensive. We agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday the image dropped from top image results, though the BBC understands Google did not remove it.</p>
<p>Instead, the image appeared to have been removed from the site that originally published it, and was therefore no longer appearing prominently in Google searches.</p>
<p>The White House has declined to comment.</p>
<p>Users who click on the advertisement above the image were directed to a statement from Google, which explained that its results &#8220;can include disturbing content, even from innocuous queries&#8221;.</p>
<p>Freedom of access to the internet means much offensive material resides there, but ordinary users are seldom exposed to it in daily online activity.</p>
<p>Occasionally, however, the world&rsquo;s most popular search engine, Google, highlights such material, which is what has happened with a mock-up photo of Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>The cause is Google&rsquo;s system of algorithmic analysis, which, without human intervention, ranks sites according to things like the number of links pointing there and the amount of activity at the site.</p>
<p>The shocking doctored image of Mrs Obama must have immediately created a flurry of interest  &mdash;  mainly negative  &mdash;  and that sent the image shooting up Google&rsquo;s rankings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We apologise if you&rsquo;ve had an upsetting experience using Google,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Google says a website&rsquo;s ranking in its search results relies heavily on computer algorithms, using thousands of factors to calculate a page&rsquo;s relevance to a given query.</p>
<p>But the search engine says it does not remove images simply because it receives complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google views the integrity of our search results as an extremely important priority,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the California-based web giant says it will take down certain images, if required by law to do so.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Google, Scott Rubin, would not give details on how the image  &mdash;  which has sparked fury in the blogosphere  &mdash;  ended up as top result for the wife of President Barack Obama.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Slippery slope&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The picture first surfaced earlier this month, when it was removed because the site hosting it violated Google guidelines by spreading so-called malware  &mdash;  malicious software designed to infiltrate other computers.</p>
<p>But the image then reappeared on another site, apparently untainted by malware, meaning Google was bound by its own rules not to meddle with the search, according to technology analysts.</p>
<p>David Vise, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author of The Google Story, told the BBC the search engine&rsquo;s results get to the top based on popularity, not because of any ranking system by people.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;If Google got a call from the White House telling them it&rsquo;s against the law to have an offensive image of this kind which portrays the first lady in a racist manner as a monkey or an ape, then they would be obliged to take it down and I&rsquo;m sure they would do so immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said it would be a &#8220;very slippery slope&#8221; if Google were to try to police the limits of free speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you begin to block images, who is to say. It&rsquo;s like the Supreme Court of the United States once said, &#8216;what is pornography?&rsquo; Well we can&rsquo;t define it, but we know it when we see it.&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Reuters, November 25, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Search engine Google is apologising for an image-search result of Michelle Obama showing her in a racist caricature.</p>
<p>The number one Google image-search result depicts the First Lady photo-edited to resemble a monkey.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post a spokesman for Google says search results are a reflection of the content on the web and simply reflect what is out there.</p>
<p>The racist image was previously removed by Google due to a complaint, however, that was because the site hosting the image was also serving malware to user&rsquo;s computers. The image has since been reloaded onto a different site which is not serving malware and under Google policy will remain there unless there is further policy violation.</p>

		<p>The internet is not like a library, with lots of information available and places and presented in a well ordered fashion; it,s more like a means of communication, like the telephone, with which you can seek information, since it connects together computers that may be separated by thousands of kilometers.</p>
<p>I think it is up to the user to use judgement, and that it is not Google&rsquo;s place, which is a private business, to start imposing limits on the constitutionnal right to free speech.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine the unmitigated gall of someone who demands that an image be removed from a search engine result just because they didn&rsquo;t like it? Aside from sexual or graphically violent images, I can&rsquo;t imagine an image of any other kind that would merit an apology from a search engine simply because it appeared in their results. And now Google has to apologize because their computer algorithm pulled up an image of Michelle Obama that some consider &#8220;racist?&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t know computers can be &#8220;racist,&#8221; but I do now. </p>
<p>Of course I knew reality was &#8220;racist&#8221; all along.</p>

		<p>What they conveniently neglect to mention is that there are plenty of pure-blooded (relatively speaking) Africans who look something like that.  There are also Australian aborigines whose appearance would strike Westerners as even more shocking.  So what, exactly, are they trying to say about Africans and Australian aborigines? </p>

<p>But I think as time goes in, Google is going to become more and more self-censored.  Don&rsquo;t forget, Larry and Sergey are big time left-wingers.</p>
<p>You can take this as a clue that I&rsquo;ll have no use for Chrome OS.  Aside from it&rsquo;s toyish nature, I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of putting all my private data on the server of a for-profit corporation run by lefties.  </p>
<p>I no more trust Google than I do Microsoft or Apple.  And I don&rsquo;t use Google&rsquo;s name as a synonym for internet search.</p>
<p>Another worrisome trend on the horizon is that Rupert Murdoch wants to de-index NewsCorp&rsquo;s sites from Google and swing a deal with Microsoft to make Bing the only search engine that can crawl NewsCorp sites.  Murdoch and MSFT already have a cooperation deal in other things.  This means that the whole search engine/corporate media industry is going to become nothing more than a massive payola scheme.  Radio station DJs were fired and fined for this sort of thing.</p>

		<p>Plain and simple, the woman is ugly.  She has three of four prominent characteristics that show her to be way off track in the tradition of Western beauty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no Paul Newman or Charlton Heston, either, but I&rsquo;m just calling an ace an ace and a spade a spade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to life than physical beauty or its opposite.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with morphing monkey type images of her.  That&rsquo;s in really bad taste.  </p>
<p>However, I think she&rsquo;s fair game if someone wants to point out that her physique looks a bit deformed, since she has wider than normal hips and looks a bit bowlegged&hellip;.. although I don&rsquo;t know if she is but she certainly looks as if she is&hellip;&hellip;because the sycophantic press keeps declaring how &#8220;lovely&#8221; she is, when we all know it&rsquo;s just more of their exaggerations or lies.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re constantly told that the POTUS is the most powerful man in the world.  So, Barack Obama is, I suppose, just that  &mdash;  so liberals need to stop wringing their hands over depictions of him and wifey as simians.  Bush II was portrayed over and over in cartoons as a monkey, yet when Obama appeared as Curious George, the earth nearly tipped on its axis.</p>

		<p>Another Google horror story:</p>
<p>In the spring of 2008, the CofCC National Website, along with many other non-political self-hosted blogs that use(d) the Wordpress blog management system AND a certain photo gallery management program (Coppermine) were cracked into.  The crackers inserted programs that infected computers that visited the photo gallery sites in question spyware, a roach-themed screensaver, and/or turned one&rsquo;s computer in a stealth e-mail server to pump out spam.</p>
<p>The CofCC national website took down the whole photo gallery within a few hours of this crack being discovered, and eventually migrated to a different photo gallery program.  Therefore, it was only for a few hours, and only if the user visited the CofCC photo gallery, that a user was vulnerable.</p>
<p>And Google put up one of those &#8220;This site might harm your computer&#8221; automatically when the vulnerability came about.  But it took them more than two months to remove the warning, even though the problem was fixed in three hours.  The CofCC National Webmaster thinks that this was a deliberate decision of the Google brats.  Especially since other Wordpress/Coppermine blogs that were cracked into, that got a similar warning from Google, saw the warning removed after a week or so.</p>

<p>As for the comments by JAY, you have me questiong his other comments, wondering if all the other times he&rsquo;s agreed with &#8216;us&rsquo; if they&rsquo;ve all been some kind of parody too.

<p>You wrote: ¬´Shouldn&rsquo;t we be concerned about what is or isn&rsquo;t in her heart?¬ª&hellip;</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s in her heart, is a hell of a lot wors than the way Michelle Obama looks, on the outside!</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s not a beauty, but it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s very ugly either. But the press keep saying that she&rsquo;s so good looking, and such a fashion icon, while none of it is true&hellip; But she remains, well, presentable. </p>
<p>As for what&rsquo;s in her heart, that woman affirmative-actionned her way through Princeton and Harvard, universities to which where her grades and extracurricular activities would never have gotten her admitted, if it wasn&rsquo;t for her skin color.</p>
<p>Still, she wrote a thesis, in Princeton, about how racist that university was, towards Blacks. And later, she attended the racist, anti-White, Black church of reverend Wright.</p>
<p>She is an ingrate, and an angry woman who blames all the problems she&rsquo;s ever had on Whites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s in her heart, I think. <br>

		<p> This is just one more piece of evidence to support what many have been saying: if non-White presidents are deemed above criticism by us wicked, majority (so far) white-bread Americans,<br>
then perhaps that is the best argument against having them (non-White POTUS&rsquo;s). And of course, even if (as predicted) Whites become a minority in this country, such thin-skinned attitudes will continue. As examples from other countries (e.g. Malaysia,<br>
S. Africa, the former Rhodesia) amply show, a less-productive<br>
and non-founding majority ethnic group will often blatantly oppress and discriminate against a minority, yet continue to live off its labors, talents and institutions. Would our alien,<br>
elitist and patently talentless commander-in-chief   &mdash;  - and his ex-shakedown-artist spouse   &mdash;  - have trillions to spend and semi-respectful audiences for their ad nauseum America-trashing trips abroad, had our nation not toiled for centuries to build up the wealth and achievements that their ilk know how to squander   &mdash;  - but not to create? </p>

<p>Actually I know plenty of Jews that have very big noses and yarmulkes on their heads, just like I&rsquo;ve worked with Jews that would make a big deal about getting an extra 75 cents from the interest of their CD&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that a lot of people on this site, Jews and Gentiles, hold views that do not correspond with so-called mainstream society, i.e., that we as whites are being supplanted by non-white hordes led by white, left-wing, multicultural internationalist. Does this affect Jews as well? Yes, and the few that have recognized this and have broken away from historically left-wing beliefs many Jews have are here on this site. From what I&rsquo;ve read, the Jews are as much worried as the rest of us with the inter-religious and interracial mixing of Jews and non-Jews, so I&rsquo;m very ready and willing to embrace any white who believes in racial preservation.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about religion, or your particular European background, this is about genes and numbers!</p>

		<p>The picture was offensive. Period. It has nothing to do with the dislocation and displacement of Whites. I am a racially conscious White and I am indeed concerned about the future of our people;however, this does not excuse anyone, us race realists included, from posting abhorrent cartoonish pictures of anyone online. </p>
<p>#15:</p>
<p>Yes. you do have the right not to be offended by such a distasteful picture, but those of us who find such retrograde behavior appalling have a right to criticize it as well. Whether you know of Jews who fit the description that was described is irrelevant.  The picture was in poor taste. </p>

		<p>Now, will Mrs. Obama apologize for HER often expressed, hateful views? Number 16, Fran√ßois, summarized them well. I would just add her well-known comment about her husband&rsquo;s candidacy being the first time she felt proud of the U.S. Have you noticed she&rsquo;s seemed rather muzzled since then? </p>
<p>If the controlled media would quit telling us how lovely and stylish she is, people would feel less driven to parody her. The First Lady isn&rsquo;t elected, but she&rsquo;s certainly among the President&rsquo;s most prominent supporters and beneficiaries. She won&rsquo;t, nor should she be, exempt from public ridicule. That goes especially for the white-hating Mrs. Obama whose cult wants to play the race card to forbid criticism of her just like they do with her husband.  <br>

		<p>This furor over a doctored photo is ridiculous. If I were sitting in the White House collecting good money - let&rsquo;s not mention the future income the Obama&rsquo;s will garner from their position - for not much of anything I wouldn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s tutu who posted what about me and mine.</p>
<p>That they are residing in the White House is an abomination to me. The fact that some are elevating Political Correctness over the hard won rights of the Constitution, specifically Freedom of Speech is beyond abominable and nigh incomprehensible. Too many out there are too willing to surrender this right simply to seem &#8220;nice&#8221; or &#8220;enlightened.&#8221; They are neither and are little more than slothful cowards who sell their souls, and culture, for comfort and gain, and would in fact brutally impose their will, ignorance and half baked ideas upon the rest of us if they could. The &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; laws are only the beginning. Freedom of Speech is perhaps the most important right of all. To abridge it is to abridge all other freedoms and assault the very core of human freedom - the freedom to think free from all artificial constraints. Without this freedom we would still believe the world is flat and that the sun revolves around the earth, and that rulers - however cruel and capricious they may be - are ordained from God to rule us and that there is nothing we can do about it except accept our sorry lot in life - grin and bear it like helpless fools.</p>
<p>The solution to &#8220;offensive&#8221; material is an old one: don&rsquo;t look; change the channel; click off the website. It is ridiculous to believe someone can offend me. I can only offend myself by accepting whatever ridiculous criticism or parody is launched against me. Sometimes &#8220;edification&#8221; comes in the form of an offense, life giving me an important lesson I should heed. In both cases it is my freedom to think free from artificial constraints that stands as guard and clerk - to judge and process, to think. Political Correctness is crafted to rob me of that capacity and force me to accept ideas and principles that have not been subjected to examination - to real thinking. Cries of &#8220;offense&#8221; are mere smoke screens to obscure clear thinking. They should be ignored, as should the impulse to be politically correct.</p>
<p>In the words of Oswald Spengler (Decline of the West): &#8220;Whenever one has the opportunity to annoy people, one should do so.&#8221; It stimulates thinking.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure altering her photo to look monkey-like is really called for.  But it&rsquo;s interesting to note that the media is in an uproar over it.  Obviously it&rsquo;s because they think she resembles a primate, and it&rsquo;s just as obvious that they&rsquo;re too unaware to understand that they give support to the photo more than anyone else.  Too, I might add that I think it&rsquo;s wrong to alter photos in that way.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the points to elaborate on are her work in school, which is blaringly substandard and quite evident she would never have been accepted to a university, let alone an Ivy League one, if she were white.  That&rsquo;s true for about 97% of the blacks who are accepted.  I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s the reason the present avisors to this president have elected to keep her in the background.  When she speaks on ideas and issues, she does so badly what she inanely says is grist for the talk shows for months afterwards.</p>

-shows her true &#8216;feelings&rsquo;. -what&rsquo;s &#8216;in her heart&rsquo;. <br>
At ANY other school, high school, OR COLLEGE - this paper would get an &#8220;F&#8221;. Content excluded, the organization of thought, spelling, etc., is all completely elementray, and by elementary, I mean, about 7th grade, not a Princeton grad level. This goes to show that blacks get a free ride. I would never hire on in my bisuness, I don&rsquo;t care where they&rsquo;ve graduated from, what their grades were - etc., it&rsquo;s all worthless. These people get &#8216;setup&rsquo; in life, put on a high pedestal, when they are completely mediocre. It&rsquo;s sad. We should pity them.</p>
