<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/us/politics/09casey.html?_r=2">Army Chief Concerned for Muslim Troops</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Berger, New York Times, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>General George Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, said on Sunday that he was concerned that speculation about the religious beliefs of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, accused of killing 12 fellow soldiers and one civilian and wounding dozens of others in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, could &#8220;cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve asked our Army leaders to be on the lookout for that,&#8221; General Casey said in an interview on CNN&rsquo;s &#8220;State of the Union. &#8220;It would be a shame  &mdash;  as great a tragedy as this was  &mdash;  it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A diverse Army gives us strength,&#8221; General Casey, who visited Fort Hood Friday, said on &#8220;This Week.&#8221;</p>

		<p>General Casey really sold out his principles for that 4th star. <br>
Casey should realize that our &#8220;backlash&#8221; mainly means preventing more of them from coming over here, and deporting trouble makers. Casey should concern himself with the next terrorist. However, I don&rsquo;t expect much from a yes man who secretly doesn&rsquo;t believe in diversity. </p>

		<p>General Casey, please do something for me that nobody else that regurgitates the same mindless bromide that you just did seems to be able to do.  And that is this:  Tell me WHY or HOW our diversity is our strength.  And don&rsquo;t say that diversity is a strength because it means many different kinds of people in one place  &mdash;  that is a DEFINITION of diversity.  But that doesn&rsquo;t explain why/how it&rsquo;s a strength.  I can think of 13 plus 31 reasons right off the top of my head why it ISN&rsquo;T a strength.</p>
<p>BTW, Janet Napolitano at HLS is also worried about an &#8220;anti-Muslim backlash.&#8221;  I wish they&rsquo;d all be more worried about the Muslim frontlash.</p>

		<p> I wonder what it will take to make U.S. officialdom and the Army brass see that Muslims are not &#8220;victims of a backlash&#8221;   &mdash;   they are the problem!</p>
<p> That is to say, Muslims blew up the Twin Towers, heavily damaged the Pentagon, hijacked the plane that was crashed in Pennsylvania before it could travel to Washington, set off murderous bomb explosions in Madrid, London and other places, rioted in the streets of France four years ago, killed several hundred Australians and Europeans by blowing up a nightclub in Bali   &mdash;   well, you get the picture. This eyewash about &#8220;99 percent of Muslims are peaceful and non-violent&#8221; won&rsquo;t get it any more. Are the terrorists giving the Muslim world as a whole a black eye? Or is the Muslim world turning a blind eye to them   &mdash;   in effect endorsing them without actually saying so?</p>
<p> Gen. Casey certainly should know better than to be moaning publicly that some of these nice, peaceful Muslims in the armed forces might become victims of a &#8220;backlash&#8221; from outraged, fed-up Americans. If, in fact, most Muslims disapprove of these terrorist attacks by their co-religionists, they had better start saying so   &mdash;   loudly. Public pressure for the federal government and the Army to &#8220;do something&#8221; about the Muslims in this country may become irresistable otherwise.</p>

		<p>General Casey is babbling about diversity after a nutcase goes on a bloody rampage.</p>
<p>BTW, Fort Hood is named after Confederate General John Bell Hood.  At the Battle of Gettysburg, Hood led his men bravely into the &#8220;devil&rsquo;s den,&#8221; where he was seriously wounded and lost the use of an arm for the rest of his life.  He later had a leg amputated for wounds suffered at the Battle of Chickamauga.  John Bell Hood continued to fight right up until the end of the war - with one arm and one leg!  His men had to strap him on his horse in the morning!</p>
<p>I wonder how John Bell Hood would have felt knowing that his namesake base was the site of a murderous rampage by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, and that President Barack Hussein Obama sent his condolences. </p>
<p>Question for General Casey:  Why can I not recall any civil war incidents of troops going postal on fellow soldiers?  Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh, etc&hellip; all had astronomical casualty rates on both sides.  The soldiers must have been stressed out.</p>

		<p>This Casey clown is just an absolute brain dead, brain-washed PC zombie. Him and Obama spend more of their time worrying about the non-existent &#8220;backlash&#8221; against muslims then they worry about protecting American citizens from the murderous intentions of these Islamic mass murderers. This is the reason these muslim killers are allowed to pull off their massacres because of this type of &#8220;hear no evil, see no evil&#8221; and definitely &#8220;speak no evil&#8221; of muslims, even when they are making their feelings known to anyone who will listen.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Army Chief Concerned for Muslim Troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not concerned that other Muslim jihadists in the military might kill innocent American troops.  He&rsquo;s not concerned that other Muslims in the military could well be plotting, right this minute, acts of terrorism.  What concerns the blithering fool is that somebody might call a Muslim a name and hold hard feelings towards him.</p>
<p>I understand this PC incompetent was backed by Obama for his position.  If so, I imagine he was selected because he gave the necessary lip service to totalitarian policies that held political correctness on a par with the same religious fervor  that jihadists do in their pursuit of a holy war.</p>
<p>The US military is a dysfunctional entity in this rapidly declining empire.  I&rsquo;m waiting for the first embarassing defeat at the hands of a weaker opposition, as a result of political correctness.</p>
<p>First, we had the empire&rsquo;s economy crash, which had a domino effect around the world, all because political correctness dictated that those who couldn&rsquo;t pay mortgages should have them anyway.  And, it has not yet hit bottom.  The second round of foreclusures on residential and commercial real estate will hit even harder after the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p>Now, these same politically correct policies have gotten many military people killed and wounded, and the possibility of another incident is highly likely.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve maintained repeatedly, our greatest enemies&hellip;.BY FAR&hellip;.are white politically correct fools who are in the media and those who hold political power.  And, those who are Obama supporters may not be able to control policy, but they&rsquo;re dangerous as well.  All of them have brought this empire to ruin, to say nothing of their dastardly conduct in Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>And, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s going to get far worse.</p>

		<p>A diverse Army does not give us strength and General Casey is very well aware of this and was very well aware of this when he was lying to the press.  The agenda to multiculturalise the western world is an at all cost agenda.  It makes no difference how many people die or of the problems that go along with it. People like General Casey will simply lie more to us while promoting more &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  So our Army Chief of Staff would appear to be a blatant liar.  Wow that really inspires me to join up.  Perhaps its part of a strategy to push people like me away who if they are to put their lives on the line for God and country would like to do so under honest leadership.  If General Casey lies about this issue then what other things is General Casey capable of lying about?  I&rsquo;ll answer that one myself and the answer is,  pretty damn much anything.   </p>

		<p>Casey must have studied military history at some point. He must know he sounds insane to declare that &#8216;a diverse army gives us strength&rsquo;. Armies with high levels of diversity tend to perform less efficiently due to underlying ethnic tensions. They can work under a strong hand, such as Hannibal (who we all know was NOT a black African). In fact the US military may someday come to resemble the Carthaginian army-a diverse collection of mercenaries. Remember the Romans win in the end after Hannibal wins most of the battles. </p>

<p>It would also be a greater shame Comrade General Casey, if a number of our solders in the U.S. Army, simply doing their duty, were shot and killed by a Muslim fanatic because diversity concerns (and the subsequent anti-white and un-American dogmas that ooze from them,) took precedence over rationality, right? Oh wait, that has already happened and apparently by your statements Comrade General Casey, you do not agree. </p>

		<p>Some etymologist should write a research paper on the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; and chronicle how it was transformed from a simple, neutral, noun to a word that describes the most exalted state of an organization, or indeed mankind.  Obviously, General Casey subscribes to the latter definition of the word and would gladly choose to have intermittent terrorist acts occur in the military then &hellip; gasp &hellip; perform more thorough background checks on Muslims before, and after they join the military.  After all, that might reduce the number of Muslims in the military and thus reduce &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>I, similar to many rational people around the world, have never heard so many loony excuses for a mass murderer in their lives.  Horrible events such as these are clearly drawing the lines between people in the world that will portend future events.  General Casey, and many others, have clearly shown what side of this line they will be on.</p>

		<p>Cassy is a useful idiot all concerned that this jihad slaughter not dissuade Muslim diversity in the army. That&rsquo;s the kind of diversity we don&rsquo;t need anywhere in the West, and certainly not in the US military. </p>
<p>This was an obvious case of sudden jihad syndrome (SJS) where a Muslim gets to feeling guilty about working with the infidel which his Koran (and imam) tell him is worthy only of hellfire (Koran 98:6). Islam has a solution to such Muslim guilt and fear of hellfire. Die at violent jihad against the enemy of Muslims (like US soldiers on way to mid-East) and all sins are forgiven and you go straight to paradise (Koran 9:111 for eg.). </p>
<p>SJS can happen to any &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslim -   not to mention committed jihadist who are not as open about their Islamism as Hasan was. Hasan is a hero to many Muslims and Cassey is just asking for more of the same, sooner or later, all in the stupid name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;!</p>
<p>Gen. Cassey is one of the many PC useful idiots that work for Obama.<br>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked our Army leaders to be on the lookout for that,&rdquo; General Casey said&hellip;.&ldquo;It would be a shame  &mdash;  as great a tragedy as this was  &mdash;  <b>if our diversity became a casualty</b> as well.&rdquo;  <br>
    <b>&ldquo;A diverse Army gives us strength,&rdquo; </b>said  General Casey, who visited Fort Hood Friday.   <br>
__   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Good grief!  Even after this terrible event,  the brass still don&rsquo;t get it!  Forty-three victims shot,  and the Chief of Staff is worried above all about protecting his precious Diversity!</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get it, they <i>won&rsquo;t </i> get it    &mdash;     and they CAN&rsquo;T get it   &mdash;    if they want to keep their jobs.  The boot-licking brass  obviously know where the real priorities lie, and they have to please their masters.</p>
<p>This surely tells us, if anything ever could, that Those Who Are In Charge place the sacred goal of Diversity  <i><b>above all other concerns</b></i>   &mdash;  -  no matter how costly they may prove to be, no matter who  gets killed, or any other considerations.  This seems to have become their overriding preoccupation.</p>
<p>In this country, as everywhere else simultaneously (that is, all white countries), diversity seems to have been moved forward  to the front burner, and is not to be sacrificed for  ANYTHING.  We bombed tiny  Serbia for 78 days to enforce it, and we will not shrink at a paltry 43 victims in the USA.   This is their goal, and they are not going to let anyone or anything stand in the way of it.  A few victims are just  a collateral expense.  Like breaking a few eggs to get an omelette.  Small potatoes!    Tut, tut.</p>

		<p>When the U.S. entered WW II, people of Japanese, German or Italian origin, most of them American citizen, were considered security risks and systematically isolated. They were not only removed from the Armed Forces and other security organisations. They were incarcerated in concentration camps by the thousands, even if they were not more than shopkeepers, farmers and blue collar workers, and were released only quite some time after the war ended. The usual human rights lobby did&rsquo;nt have any qualms about it. The U. S. are in a war today, too, but are totally unable to do something even remotely similar, i. e. keeping security risks out of the Armed Forces or, at least, removing them as soon as there are well-founded doubts about their loyalty.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t only happen in America but the connection is glaringly obvious.  The bodies of six soldiers killed in Afghanistan - including five who died when an Afghan policeman  turned his gun on them - returned to home to Britain on Tuesday. Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant, 40, Sgt Matthew Telford, 37, and Guardsman Jimmy Major, 18, from the Grenadier Guards, died alongside Cpl Steven Boote, 22, and Cpl Nicholas Webster-Smith, 24, from the Royal Military Police. They were shot dead by a &#8221;rogue&#8221; Afghan police officer (who the Brits were training) at a secure checkpoint in Nad-e-Ali in Helmand Province on November 3 in an attack claimed by the Taliban. Both these murderers were muslim and took advantage of their fellow soldiers who were unprepared, unarmed and trusted their attacker. So where is the trust? Sod the politicians. </p>

<p>Where is the reassuarnce for the target community - non muslims.</p>
<p>How come the default setting after an Islamic Terrorist attack is to bleat about the fear in the muslim community and concerns for their safety? Why do they obfuscate and lie by attributing other reasons to the attacks rather than the obvious Islamist ideology? </p>
<p>How many &#8220;American&#8221; muslims have been murdered by other Americans.</p>

<p>General Hood&rsquo;s contemporary General Robert E. Lee after the war said in a letter to the Governor of Texas, &#8220;Governor, if I had forseen the use those people designed to make of their victory, there would have been no surrender at Appomattox Courthouse; no sir, not by me.

		<p>Why any European American would join such an organization as the modern military is beyond me.  Look at the overall pictures of individuals being killed and maimed in Iraq and Afghanistan: They are European Americans.  Look at the overall pictures of the individuals killed and wounded at Fort Hood by Nidal Malik Hasan: They are European Americans.  European Americans are cannon fodder for these wars, conflicts, police actions, and in-house slaughters.  The most horrendous secular sin is the betrayal of one&rsquo;s race.  General Casey fits the script of betrayal, completely.  This modern day Judas Iscariot probably sleeps in his four star uniform.  </p>

<p>&gt; Perhaps this is a prophetic statement.  As American citizens burn out on repeated deployments, and the long time reliable pool of young dedicated white men from rural regions dries up, the practice of recruiting non-citizens, something that has been quietly going on for some time now, will likely increase.  When the time finally does come that civil disorder breaks out due to a number of likely causes, some of them inevitable, we will likely experience martial law enforced by a non-American citizen army that claims authority.  Since it will likely not be completely non-US Citizen, this may be when the Civil War 2 scenario kicks in.  It won&rsquo;t be a nice time for anyone, however.

		<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Casey doesn&rsquo;t actually believe the garbage he spews in public, but he knows Obama would fire him in a microsecond if he dared speak the truth. And that would be the end of the &#8220;four P&rsquo;s&#8221;   &mdash;   power, prestige, perks &amp; pension   &mdash;   that all senior officers cling to at any cost, which is why he&rsquo;ll never resign either. That&rsquo;s also why Gen. McChrystal&rsquo;s supposed threat to resign if he doesn&rsquo;t get the additional cannon fodder he wants in Afghanistan is so much &#8220;bollocks,&#8221; as the British like to say.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he genuinely believes the garbage <i>when he spews it</i>, but privately admits the truth. This ability to believe two contradictory things at once is, of course, known as &#8220;doublethink,&#8221; which Orwell&rsquo;s <i>1984</i> made famous.</p>
<p>Anonymous (#57): You beat me to the rebuttal. I almost broke out laughing when I read #37. Even in 1991, Iraq had no significant navy or air force, and its army had been severely damaged in its long war against Iran. Desert Storm was the military equivalent of the Indianapolis Colts vs. a high school JV team.</p>

<p>I think the only way we can crush Talibans, Al-Qaeda members, Iranians fanatics and the like, is to destroy alla of them NOW while we can. F  &mdash;  - human rights, this is about the survival of the White race.</p>
<p>We can use nukes, biological, chemical weapons. But whatever weapons technology we use, we must erase Islam and the nations who pratise that religion from existence, before Iran gets its own ICBMs or some Al-Qaeda operatives make a stolen russian nuke explode in the heart of New York City.</p>
<p>Once we get rid of Muslims forever, it should be a simple matter to deal with Asians, Blacks and Mestizos.</p>
<p>I know I must sound like I&rsquo;m crazy&hellip; but try to prove to me that I am wrong!</p>

		<p>62 Anon: I think you&rsquo;re right.  Our Rulers really seem to be in a hurry to pollute us irretrievably.  How many Whites with half a brain really believe that diversity is a strength, or don&rsquo;t recognize what a hairball this General is to say so in response to a Moslem &#8220;American&rsquo;s&#8221; murder of a dozen soldiers?  Just as politicians know that one angry letter represents a thousand angry people who just don&rsquo;t write letters, people know that this Hasan represents a thousand Jihadists in American uniform.  General Casey had better hope that in the event of his masters losing this race, they&rsquo;ll let him have a job polishing silver in one of their private island estates.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;When the U.S. entered WW II, people of Japanese, German or Italian origin, most of them American citizen, were considered security risks and systematically isolated&#8221;. </p>
<p>Japan also interned Westerners across Asia during the war. Their living conditions were nothing like those of Axis sympathisers interned in the West. The media never discusses, and the government never apologizes, to the descendants of Italian Americans and German Americans interned during the war. It doesn&rsquo;t fit the story line. </p>

<p>I completely agree with you. Most White Americans including most immigration reform types do understand how dangerous the situation is becomming for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. If the &#8220;US&#8221; miltary,police departments and DA offices become non-white&hellip;.NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are finished&hellip;for good.</p>
<p>Iraq war one wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Kuwait was a brutal chattel slave state that enslaved who knows how many Phillipino and Indian Women. Kuwait was doing directional drilling across its border into Iraqi oil fileds. What would the US do in a similar situation? WE all know the answer to this question.</p>

		<p>General Hood&rsquo;s contemporary General Robert E. Lee after the war said in a letter to the Governor of Texas, &ldquo;Governor, if I had forseen the use those people designed to make of their victory, there would have been no surrender at Appomattox Courthouse; no sir, not by me. Had I forseen these results of subjugation, I would have preferred to die at Appomattox with my brave men, my sword in my right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    I have a feeling that Marse Robert would be the first one sent to Leavenworth today. He never would have dreamed the mess we are in now. The country sure has changed  &mdash;  for the worst!</p>

That&rsquo;s irrelevant.  That doesn&rsquo;t matter.  There are certain people who LIKE diversity. They think it&rsquo;s  wonderful; and they&rsquo;re determined to push it on all the rest of us,  whether we like it or not.  A few minor inconveniences  (to you)  don&rsquo;t&rsquo; count.  <br>

		<p>I am very touched that General Casey has displayed such concern for &#8220;our Muslim soldiers&#8221;.  How compassionate of him! <br>
(Not that any of them have been harmed or have suffered in any way, but he&rsquo;s just taking precautions for their wellbeing.)</p>
<p>Now, perhaps he can work up some similar concern for all the rest, such as the actual victims,  who surely could use it.</p>
