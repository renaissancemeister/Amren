<p>In one superwoman leap, [Kai] Soremekun skipped even trying to shop the series to a broadcast or cable television studio.</p>
<p>The Web gave her the freedom to fly creatively, she says. How many black female superheroes are on television now? How many black women are writing their own scripts, controlling their own stories, weaving in metaphors about black women in real life who need to be superheroes just to survive?</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of black projects in the studio system, they have been much more cookie-cutter,&#8221; says Soremekun, a seasoned Hollywood actress, who plays the superwoman herself. &#8220;On the Web, you can explore other ideas. &#8220;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Web television has been around since the &rsquo;90s, but in the past year edgy new shows by, for and about minorities are proliferating on the Internet. Many of the new series take the form of webisodes  &mdash;  episodes that usually last about five minutes, aimed at the short-attention spans of the all-mighty Millennium Generation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, minority writers, producers and actors have complained about the lack of diversity on television. Last year, the NAACP Hollywood bureau criticized a &#8220;virtual whiteout&#8221; in broadcast television. &#8220;At a time when the country is excited about the election of the first African American president in U.S. history, it is unthinkable that minorities would be so grossly underrepresented on broadcast television,&#8221; NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a statement.</p>
<p>Robert Thompson, a white professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, says the lack of diversity in programming is counterintuitive, given the breakthrough success of programs such as &#8220;Roots&#8221; and &#8220;The Cosby Show.&#8221; &#8220;The general politics of people who run television may have at some point been close to admitting diversity and people of color, but the fact remains when the NAACP did its report, the results were shocking,&#8221; says Thompson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But other factors also lie behind the jump to the Web. One is generational. Just like mainstream broadcast and cable executives, minority players also view the Web as a tool to draw the viewers under 30 sought by advertisers. Research shows that many younger viewers want quicker story lines and characters that don&rsquo;t take too much time to understand and they want them on demand, with the freedom to pause and replay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Web sites dedicated to hosting independent webisodes by and about people of color are emerging. Aside from RowdyOrbit.com, entertainer and entrepreneur Percy Miller, a.k.a. Master P, announced plans to launch Better Black Television next year. Miller says the network will provide family-friendly shows, including shows on fitness, financial planning, sitcoms, dramas and &#8220;responsible hip-hop music and videos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With BBTV, we&rsquo;re spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family-friendly hip-hop content,&#8221; Miller said in a statement.</p>
<p>BET.com has also entered the fray with the launch earlier this month of &#8220;Buppies,&#8221; its first original scripted Web drama. The show revolves around Quinci, the socialite daughter of a Hollywood celebrity, and follows Quinci&rsquo;s relationship dramas as she and her friends &#8220;navigate L.A.&rsquo;s young black power elite.&#8221; The series stars actress Tatyana Ali, who played Ashley Banks, the cousin of Will Smith&rsquo;s character in &#8220;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denmark West, president of digital media at BET.com, says that although the show&rsquo;s core audience likely will be African American, they are hoping it will have broader appeal, perhaps following in the steps of crossover shows like &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221; and &#8220;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>For many minority players who feel stifled by the entertainment industry, the ability to skip Hollywood and go directly to the Internet is an option made in heaven. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Lockout&#8221; was created by Ricardo Islas, who converted a traditional long-form movie into 21 short takes for the Internet. The 40-year-old native of Uruguay and senior television producer in Chicago has made dozens of movies, including &#8220;The Day of the Dead&#8221; and &#8220;To Kill a Killer,&#8221; which was released by Warner Bros. in 2003.</p>
<p>He turned to the Internet to tell more fully realized stories about Latino culture. &#8220;This is nothing new that Hollywood and networks in general are dominated by white males. They are being protective of their territory especially since the cake is smaller and there are less shares,&#8221; Islas says. &#8220;What we&rsquo;ve been able to do is find our niche. And like in the &rsquo;70s when black exploitation films were filling a demand, we are supplying what underserved communities demand because main media and main networks are not supplying what they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lockout is about [a white] American man fired from his job because he doesn&rsquo;t want to move to a different location,&#8221; Islas says. &#8220;He develops a resentment against minorities because he feels they are taking his job.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the movie progresses, the man encounters more minorities and becomes paranoid. &#8220;That is where the horror kicks in.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks(I don&rsquo;t know about mestizos) area already over represented on television.  Blacks are 12-15% of the population, so approximately 1 out of 10 people you see on television should be black.  Statistics have shown that the number is already far greater than that.</p>
<p>Pointless whining.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A lack of diversity on television&#8221;  &mdash;  what a joke!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least one black person in every commercial. The sports channels are overwhelmingly black. In both movies and television there&rsquo;s always black people playing elevated roles where blacks are seldom found in real life, such as doctors, judges, mayors, etc.</p>
<p>I have a friend from New Zealand. She thought that the USA was 40% black, because blacks are always overrepresented in the media. She thought I was joking when I told her that America was only 13% black.</p>

		<p>Interesting bit of trivia here.  There&rsquo;s a certain domain name which I am barred from stating here. It&rsquo;s www.[N-word].com.   Know who owns it? </p>
<p>AboutUs: WWW.[N-word].COM   	<br>
Registrant: 	<br>
NAACP <br>
4805 Mt. Hope Dr.<br>
Baltimore, MD 21215</p>
<p>The NAACP bought the rights to the website www.[N-word].com to prevent online exploitation of the term. Since that domain name did not resolve to a working DNS, it ended up displaying advertisement links on a &ldquo;parked page&#8221; with hilarious consequences.<br>

		<p>Just watched an episode of &#8220;V&#8221; tonight and the good alien was a black man, and the one of the most evil aliens was a man of very Nordic appearance.  Blacks are way over-represented on network television, and they are almost portrayed as the most knowledgeable characters with sound judgment.  Whites, especially white males, are almost always portrayed as twits or hateful people. </p>
<p>I do not watch them, but there are numerous crime dramas on television and I would bet the ranch that whites are cast as the villains in 90%+ of the episodes.  The left&rsquo;s relentless social engineering is being broadcast into our households, and molding the minds of the weakest among us.</p>
<p>So what exactly is the NAACP complaining about???<br>

		<p>Not only are blacks far over represented on tv, it is often done in the most provocative way.   If you see a black man alone in a shot, count how many times you see a white woman, usually a blonde, next - and that is if they weren&rsquo;t just paired up in a shot.  My wife and I actually made a game of it for a while, to count them during a commercial break.  Miscegenation is being pushed, and pushed hard on tv.  The blacks who feel under-represented on tv, must be looking for something even more provocative online, like black on white sex sites.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s actually humorous that the non-whites are complaining about being under-represented on television. From my observations, nothing could be further from the truth. Try to find any show on television without a non-white component of less than 12%. If you can, it will be a rarity. I just read an article regarding comic Bill Engvall and how he is expressing his frustration since TBS decided to cancel his show while supporting anything that Tyler Perry or George Lopez want to do. Uh, Bill&hellip;has it occurred to you that you&rsquo;re the wrong &#8220;flavor of the month&#8221;? Hit the tanning salon for a few intense treatments and lower your I.Q. by a dozen-and-a-half points and TBS will probably welcome you back with open arms.</p>

		<p>So minorities whose story ideas are turned down by the white-invented tv industry and the white-invented movie industry are able at express themselves on the white-invented internet.</p>
<p>Have they ever thanked our people for any of our inventions and medical cures? Of course not. Instead they say we stole the technology from the black Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</p>

		<p>Here in UK we have &#8216;colourtelly.tv&rsquo; with several promising selections, news for one. This turns out to be reggai and rap music with photo&rsquo;s of black artists. No sign of actual news. One selection entitled &#8216;sistas&rsquo;.. really spelled that way. Then there&rsquo;s &#8216;Studio Chat&rsquo;. Big deal&hellip; viewer comments disabled by moderator and then no longer accepted. Lots of background noise, sounded more like a staff canteen than a studio. 5 black women sittin&rsquo; aroun&rsquo; chattin&rsquo; &#8216;n stuff, all talkin&rsquo; at same time. Something about dolls and their children not liking the black one. Anyway, this great five minute feature will shown on the first Thursday of every month. If this is all on offer, then it&rsquo;s not going anywhere. But then, wait for it, &#8216;Scotland Yardie&rsquo; One female black police officer droning on about her duties in a notorious black area of London. Sounded like a basic training course first day lecture. Stolen bicycles, untaxed cars, truanting children being taken to school unless they were with their parents! This &#8216;home&rsquo; site has plenty of links to rap stars and rap noise. I recommend at least a quick look to anyone in UK. USA AMRENer&rsquo;s will probably have seen lots of black channels at home but this UK channel is squirmingly embarrassing. Oh yes.. they look for a £10 a month subscription to see all the good stuff. If I was a serious black businessman, I would gladly pay them £10 to take it off air altogether!! Score 1/10 for nothing in particular.</p>
