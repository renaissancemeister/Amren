<h1>4 Lakewood Officers Slain; Ex-Con Sought for Questioning</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Martin, Seattle Times, November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 37-year-old Tacoma man, Maurice Clemmons, is being sought for questioning in the execution-style shooting of four Lakewood police officers this morning, according to law-enforcement officials.</p>
<p>Clemmons was identified as a person of interest in the slayings, but not as a suspect.</p>
<p>Pierce County sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Ed Troyer said Clemmons had been seen in the area of the shootings at the time they occurred.</p>
<p>Clemmons, who was recently released from jail, has an extensive criminal record in Pierce County and Arkansas, court records show. He currently faces eight criminal charges in Washington state.</p>
<p>The four officers were killed at about 8:15 a.m. by a scruffy-looking man who walked into a coffee shop and opened fire. The officers  &mdash;  three men and one woman  &mdash;  were found dead by deputies who arrived at Forza Coffee at 11401 Steele St. S., Troyer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Troyer said the investigation into the shootings indicate that the gunman &#8220;flat-out executed&#8221; two of the officers. One officer then stood up, tried to go for the gunman and was shot, Troyer said.</p>
<p>The fourth officer was involved in some kind of struggle with the gunman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before that fourth officer was killed, Troyer said, he apparently managed to fire at the shooter.</p>
<p>Troyer said if the gunman was shot, he could be traveling some distance to get care. Troyer suggested the man may try to visit a medical facility and claim he had suffered an accidental gunshot wound.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The officers were in uniform, including bulletproof vests, and were working on their laptop computers as they prepared to start their day shifts, Troyer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gunman was described as a black man in his 20s or 30s, between 5-feet-7 inches and 5-feet-10-inches, and ran north on Steele Street South after the shooting. He was wearing a black coat over a gray hooded sweat shirt and bluejeans, Troyer said.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/11/huckabee-commuted-sentence-of.html">Huckabee Commuted Sentence of Suspect in Washington Police Slayings</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Garance Franke-Ruta, Washington Post, November 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee started Sunday morning by dialing back expectations about his political future, but by evening, it was his past that was at issue when the Seattle Times broke news that the suspect in the slaying of four police officers in a Seattle suburb was a former Arkansas resident who had had his sentence commuted by Huckabee and who was wanted on an outstanding Arkansas warrant.</p>
<p>In response to the revelations, Huckabee released a statement seeking to cast some of the responsibility onto the parole board that freed the man, 37-year-old Maurice Clemmons, and the criminal justice system that repeatedly failed to properly handle the convicted felon. Said Huckabee:</p>
<p>&#8220;The senseless and savage execution of police officers in Washington State has saddened the nation, and early reports indicate that a person of interest is a repeat offender who once lived in Arkansas and was wanted on outstanding warrants here and Washington State. The murder of any individual is profound tragedy, but the murder of a police officer is the worst of all murders in that it is an assault on every citizen and the laws we live within.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should he be found to be responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington State. He was recommended for and received a commutation of his original sentence from 1990, making him parole eligible and was paroled by the parole board once they determined he met the conditions at that time. He was arrested later for parole violation and taken back to prison to serve his full term, but prosecutors dropped the charges that would have held him. It appears that he has continued to have a string of criminal and psychotic behavior but was not kept incarcerated by either state. This is a horrible and tragic event and if found and convicted the offender should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our thoughts and prayers are and should be with the families of those honorable, brave, and heroic police officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revelation marks the second time Huckabee&rsquo;s clemency decisions have become an issue. {snip}</p>

		<p>my apologies for no cap&rsquo;s and certain puncuation d/t broken shorted keyboard.</p>
<p>i wonder how much greater the news coverage would have been had the races been reversed. an argument could be made that not only was the crime anti-cop but that it was anti-white as well. i only watch fox news for my new coverage and don&rsquo;t know how much the coverage was on other channels. there may not have been any news about it. it wouldn&rsquo;t have surprised me. it contradicts their agenda.<br>
well, this guy has got to give up sooner or later. he will appempt to seek medical attention b/c his injuries are too grave.<br>
look for him to give up in the next day or so. <br>
if this was not a capital offense they show me one.</p>

		<p>Huckabee is the same idiot who thinks Jesus is giving us an opportunity to apologize for slavery by giving amnesty to illegal aliens. </p>
<p>If there is anyone reading this who thinks that the Republican party is in any way conservative, I hope you have finally been disabused of that notion. </p>

		<p> Since the publication of the above story Clemmons has been identified as the prime suspect, but was still on the run the last I checked the TV news. I&rsquo;m really surprised that the media showed pictures of both him and the slain officers; usually when it&rsquo;s a black-on-White, heinous crime they try to hide the fact that the perpetrator was black. But I guess in this case the fact that a description of the suspect was released to the news media, kind of let the cat out of the bag.</p>
<p> If they manage to catch this total sociopath alive, then no prosecutor should even consider a plea bargain that allows him to live. He is a total disgrace to the human race   &mdash;   a waste of oxygen and food.</p>

		<p>This is the ONLY newsource that mentions that the victims were white and that the accused perpetrator was not white; why is AmRen the only source of the race of the involved parties anyway? It matters to me that a Black man shot four whites without reason from behind, while the vicims were getting ready for their day. It should matter to every white father and white mother, every white man and woman, boy and girl.</p>

		<p>RIP, Mike Huckabee&rsquo;s Presidential ambitions. 2007-2009.</p>
<p>BTW, he pardoned a whole lot of people like this, because he (nor many other Christians) can discern the difference between punishment and forgiveness, and that the latter does not preclude the former.</p>
<p>I have been worried for a few years that black gangs or other groups of blacks would take up these kinds of ambushes against white cops.  (Note all 4 Sheriffs Deputies murdered here are white.)  With Obama in the White House, black arrogance has shot up to sky high levels.</p>
<p>BTW, didn&rsquo;t the county that Seattle itself is in, King County, recently change its namesake to Martin Luther King?  I know it was another, 1800s &#8220;King&#8221; before.  </p>

<p>Funny, I wonder why the police are so eager this time to give a full description of the suspect, including his race? Better still, will be if they actually work up the nerve to call this a (gasp) black on white hate crime!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I hate what happened to these four officers, but the blatant hypocrisy of the police in such matters is so glaring that I couldn&rsquo;t help but comment on it. After all, if it were: me, you, and our friends Joe and Sue, who were gunned down you better believe they and the media swine would be twisting like tornados to deny racial issues, including the obvious race of the gunman. </p>
<p>In an aside, the suspect being sought for questioning in this case is one Maurice Clemmons; he is a real charmer with a long criminal history. Interestingly, when he was Governor of Arkansas, that groveling multicultural buffoon Comrade Mike Huckabee, granted him clemency:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine years ago, then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee granted clemency to Clemmons, commuting his lengthy prison sentence over the protests of prosecutors.&rdquo; See this link:</p>
<p>https://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010385617_webmansought29.html</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will be the end of any possible future presidential aspirations for this illegal alien mollycoddler and slavery apologist. Oh to be sure, FOX News will retain him as their folksy Neo Con snake oil salesman, but we should be spared ever having his brand of multicultural treacle ooze from him in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>If not and as always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>This is why citizens need to be armed. A man may walk into a business and shot four people sitting at a table but if other customers were armed his odds of escaping would not be so good. </p>

		<p>Back in 1989 when David Dinkins was elected Mayor of the city of New York, the crime rate in New York City sky-rocketed in the next 4 years.  New York City has never seen a crime rate as high as it was in those 4 years before or since.  In that 1989 election he defeated Rudy Giuliani.  In 1993 Guiliani ran again against Dinkins.  This time he won. The crime rate dropped considerably in the next 4 years. Could this be the beginning of what we&rsquo;re going to get with the Obama administration?  Could this be the beginning of Blacks really going wild against Whites even more than they&rsquo;re already doing?</p>

		<p>Karma.</p>
<p>Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee - &#8220;the Huckster&#8221; was my choice for White majority renegade/traitor of the year (an annual award given each year by the great White Nationalist magazine Instauration.) The Huckster was brought into the Presidential GOP race at the last minute to stop the nomination of Mass Governor Mitt Romney - Romney&rsquo;s great crime was that he belonged to the Church of Jesus Ghrist of Latter Day Saints - the Mormons, until very recently an all White church.</p>
<p>But, the idiot Religious Right Evangelical Christians in the GOP who want to &#8220;Save the world for Jesus&#8221; which almost always includes bringing all the saved and unsaved Third World people of color into America to &#8220;get saved&#8221; and then work for minimum wage at Walmart or in agribusinesses in states like Arkansas - these idiots main obsession with the 2008 Presidential race was that a White Latter Day Saint might get elected President so they brought out, bank rolled the Huckster and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Hucklebee presents the strongly anti White program of the Neo Cons - invade the world, invite the world and in hoc to the world, but presents it in a wholesome White Judeo Christian &#8220;family values&#8221; package - the Huckster even feature political adverts looking to save Christmas.</p>
<p>So now it comes out that the Huckster did a Mike Dukakis Willie Horton style pardon and now we have what - five murdered White police officers in Washington State for his efforts.</p>
<p>All Amren readers must now work to ensure that Mike Hucklebee&rsquo;s political career is over - don&rsquo;t let any lying or confused White Judeo Christians present his name in any positive way. This Black thug, criminal should have been executed or put to sleep a long time ago, thanks to the Huckster, he was let go to murder good White folks. The Huckster can not be allowed to fool any more of our people again.</p>

		<p>As soon as I heard initial [and almost fact-free] reports of 4 policemen killed, I was ready to put money on two bets:</p>
<p>1. Perp: &#8220;diverse&#8221;<br>
2. Victims: not</p>
<p>  &mdash;  &hellip;right again.</p>
<p>And by &#8220;fact-free&#8221;, I do mean the conspicuous absence of a description of the suspect, even as a manhunt for him is underway.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more: today as I prepared for work, I listened to the NPR &#8216;Morning Edition&rsquo; report on the crime, and after the reporter had actually mentioned the suspect&rsquo;s race, he wound up his blurb with a typical feel-good &#8216;perspective&rsquo; comment: that the victims were all in their 30s and 40s&hellip;and that they all had children. But not one word about something else important that they shared as clearly shown in the photos above. No surprise there, of course.</p>

		<p>I know this area.  Lakewood is a nice little town south of Tacoma off I-5, south of Seattle and northeast of Olympia.  Between Lakewood and Olympia are McCHord AFB and Fort Lewis.  Tacoma, a major port, has long been a bad region, and has been heavily settled by blacks since WW2 (shipyards).  Lakewood has been a white majority enclave with a scenic little downtown and waterfront area.  There is little doubt in my mind that the perp choose it because of the white majority.  All four police were of course, white.</p>
<p>Mike Huckabee is a former candidate for president with an eye, some have thought, to 2012.  He is also well known for his Christian outlook and time as a preacher.  There has been some discussion on how Christianity has been a major factor in how whites betray themselves.  I can&rsquo;t think of a better topical example than this one.  Few I venture, will call him a communist.</p>

		<p>How many more atrocities are  we going to abide before we strike back at these animals and at their apologists? Isn&rsquo;t it quite obvious that we are the targets of a Dirty War; a guerilla war aimed at White People? How many more murders? How many more atrocious sexual attacks against our women? How many more punch outs?</p>

		<p>What is Huckabee going to say? The truth is that there is political capital to be made by pardoning black criminals. It demonstrates his &#8220;humanity&#8221; to let one out before he has served his time. The statistical likelihood of someone who has been pardoned returning to jail is only slightly lower than those who serve out their terms. The chances of someone gaining a lot of press coverage for their subsequent crimes is usually outweighed by the warm feelings that it generates in the black community for a White politician who is willing to pander. </p>
<p>For the recidivism rate for those who have been pardoned:</p>

		<p>A lot of loose ends to tie up with this one.</p>
<p>Was there an accomplice?</p>
<p>Why did it take twelve hours for the police to realize he was NOT in the house that was beseiged?</p>
<p>Was this a planned killing of cops or did he originally intend to rob the coffee shop? That coffee shop was frequented by cops just preparing to go on duty. The perp knew that?</p>
<p>This guy seems to have been a pretty good shooter for a villain. Hard to take down that many folks so quick when all the victims had bullet proof vests on. Where did he learn to handle a handgun so well?</p>
<p>I cannot recall of such a mass killing of cops where the perp has eluded the cops for so long so well. What is that?</p>

		<p>Hopefully something good will come out of this like derailing another neocon bid for the White House.  Huckabee must have some kind of fetish for blacks and Mexicans because it seems like he&rsquo;s always talking about them.  I don&rsquo;t listen to his program but I heard him talking as I was flipping the radio stations about how &#8220;The Blind Side&#8221; was the best movie he ever saw and he went on to lecture people about helping their fellow man.  I doubt very much this is the best movie he&rsquo;s ever seen and this is just pure political posturing.  Hey Huckabee why don&rsquo;t you stop preaching down to us and set an example by adopting a black kid into your family?  You make me want to vomit. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a scene like this, or the impact it has on those close to the victims.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exception when the race of a suspect is reported by the media.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this is the second time I&rsquo;ve seen this exception coincide with the murder of law enforcement officers (I think the other time was the Lovelle Mixon case).</p>

		<p>Yes, we all really know that blacks are dangerous. We&rsquo;ve always known that. That&rsquo;s why before common sense died, blacks lived in their own neighborhood. Red lining and restrictive covenants in so many cities were enforced for a good reason. Be nice to go back to the days when you could keep them out of your neighborhood and police them more closely. </p>

		<p> Good points Jedderman/21. I&rsquo;m not going to comment on the areas already well covered. My input on this one:</p>
<p> I haven&rsquo;t been to Lakewood or even to Washington very much, but I read on other blogs that Lakewood has changed a good deal demographically in the last few years.<br>
 My guess on why they waited so long to make an entry: they already lost 4 cops and aren&rsquo;t eager to lose any more. If he was as badly wounded as he supposedly was, easier to go through the motions of negotiating and let him bleed. There was at first much speculation that he was dead inside the dwelling.<br>
  You don&rsquo;t have to be an especially skilled marksman to make headshots at 4 feet-just deceptive and ruthless. If it was Clemmons, his background suggests he has those qualities. It takes a mean dude to gun down 4 armed opponents, even taking them by surprise. He supposedly took at least one torso hit in the process. I&rsquo;m guessing that the whole thing took place in under 15 seconds, including the struggle.<br>
 Yes there is something in this that suggests that the shooter had a lot of help. They have already said that he has friends and family helping him, but his apparent escape suggests to me that it was more than one or two helping him, which brings up the possibility that this was not a spontaneous shooting. Also the bad leads and false sightings hint at a deliberate disinformation effort.<br>
  Thinking about what has been happening throughout the country over the last couple of weeks, I am reminded of the 70&rsquo;s when the BLA and other radical groups were running amok. This is a time for increased personal vigilance. Keep your powder dry, brothers and sisters.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not about race, it&rsquo;s about us letting our courts and parole system side with terrorists.  Phillip Garrido, a white person was allowed to kidnap women and children and keep them as sex slaves.  This went on for 18 years while he was on parole, on California&rsquo;s Megan&rsquo;s law list - and neighbors complaints to cops about kids in captivity were failed.  His violations of parole didn&rsquo;t get recorded.  Now the State Inspector General did a report on the failures, yet none of the parole officers, their supervisors and judges lost their jobs or went to jail for letting Garrido continue rapes and stalking.  Nothing has changed.</p>

There is no way short of putting them back in their place irrevocably, pending repatriation back to africa. All this talk of police and prosecution is counterproductive. Do not allow yourselves to still believe there is any other way to rectify this situation, other than wholesale violence.</p>

<p>So it looks like your incident never made the &ldquo;national headlines&rdquo; for a very good reason which is THAT IT NEVER HAPPENED!</p>

		<p>Just read on another news site that this perp was caught up with and was shot and killed.  That&rsquo;s one animal that won&rsquo;t be taking up tax dollars in prison.  Thing is, the reason it was so hard to catch up to him after this heinous crime?  ALL his family, relatives, friends were hiding him, lying to the police, aiding him with money and cars, to elude the police.  One sister even patched him up for his gunshot wound.  All black, of course.  Blacks will ALWAYS stick up for a black no matter what he did, or does, and especially if it was against a WHITE victim.  This is why blacks should NEVER have been given the vote.  Not even the 3/5 vote that was constitutionally provided.  They have proven time and again that they are not responsible, that they lie routinely, that they are NOT a part of the society around them but in fact are it&rsquo;s enemy, and as a voting block care not a whit for the constitution.  Jury nullification by a black jury on behalf of a black criminal no matter HOW heinous the crime is routine.  </p>

		<p>I heard Mike Hugabee address the issue of commuting this creeps sentence 10 years ago, while he was Governor of Arkansas.  He explained that this guy had gotten a 107 year sentence when he was just 16 years old.</p>
<p>This is just a bunch of spin from another white governor, who on the advise of his advisers reduced this guy&rsquo;s sentence to 47 years, making him eligble for parole.  Once paroled, he violeted his probation, which should have sent him back to prison with the original sentence of 107 years.  Were he still serving that sentence, he would not have been out to murder the 4 officers in Washington.</p>

		<p>I have been watching this from Seattle, where I reside. </p>
<p>It is one of the rare, interesting cases like Hurricane Katrina, where events are so dramatic and move so fast that the usual filters cannot be applied to the news until after the fact. At one point the Seattle Times (a staunchly liberal rag) put the four pictures of the white cops directly adjacent to the picture of the black murderer, at the top of Page One. You don&rsquo;t see that very often in this town. After a while they moved the killer&rsquo;s image so it was not next to the cops&rsquo; but it stayed on page 1. </p>
<p>How could they do otherwise? A sociopathic murderer was loose in the city; everyone wanted to know what he looked like so they could run like hell if they saw him. The four policemen had been slain; to show Clemons without showing them would have been disrespectful, another no-no. So they showed them together. </p>
<p>The breaking news now is that the cops are arresting people said to have helped him, including one who allegedly was with him during the initial shooting and drove a getaway car. His sister drove him to his aunt&rsquo;s house where he holed up overnight, clearing out ahead of the heat, allegedly with the help of some other dudes. </p>
<p>Everyone involved, of course, is black. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be fun watching them try to spin *this* one. </p>

<p>https://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/04/pittsburgh.officers.shot/index.html</p>
<p>The shooter, Richard Poplawski, was certainly white, the four cops shot (3 dead) were unlikely to be black: their names are Paul Sciullo, Stephen Mayhle, Eric Kelly, and Timothy McManaway. <br>
The transformation of the cops to all-black is an interesting glimpse into the psyche of the left.  </p>
<p>It may be that the police department in this town is all-white or nearly so, or it may be that these white cops just liked to hang around with other white cops,  or that the shooter would have fired at the uniform regardless of who was wearing it,  but the fact that the racial aspects of this shooting get no commentary is a good illustration of the complete control white-hating Political Correctness has over debate in this county.   One thing is certain,  any indication  that the shooter was motivated by race must be ferreted out and if found  that grand old question from Watergate must be asked of the local media and police:  what did you know and when did you know it?  Suppressing such information makes these groups accessories after the fact to this crime and before and during the fact for the next one. </p>

		<p>Huckster said on Fox News last night that these murders represent &#8220;shortcomings in the criminal justice system.&#8221;  Among which are that pandering Governors issue pardons to pander to blacks and b/c they don&rsquo;t know the difference between forgiveness and punishment.</p>
<p>He also tried to excuse his pardon by saying that such a long sentence was too harsh for a 16-year old.  Well, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t, in retrospect.  Maybe the prosecutor and judge saw something wrong.  And maybe they were privy to his juvenile rap sheet, which we aren&rsquo;t.  It was probably feet long.</p>

<p>Mike Huckabee is a former candidate for president with an eye, some have thought, to 2012. He is also well known for his Christian outlook and time as a preacher. There has been some discussion on how Christianity has been a major factor in how whites betray themselves. I can&rsquo;t think of a better topical example than this one. Few I venture, will call him a communist&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion seems to be between you and everyone else.  Don&rsquo;t point the finger at some elitist&rsquo;s paid stooge to find fault with Christianity.  Politicians have been manipulating people through their faith for centuries including the ongoing farce in Iraq and Afghanistan.   <br>

		<p>My regards to Seattle police officer Benjamin L. Kelly, the man who ended the life of black savage Maurice Clemmons. </p>
<p>According to one news source, the police have so far arrested four friends and family members of the savage and expect to arrest more. These people provided money, food, cell phones, transportation, and hideouts to the murderer of the four white officers. What&rsquo;s more, they made false tips to the police to throw them off the trail of the killer. </p>
<p>This needs to be said again and again: A large percentage of the black population HATES whites. </p>

		<p>&#8220;<i>The person talking about &ldquo;four black cops&rdquo; is presumably confusing Nashville with Pittsburgh:</i></p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/04/pittsburgh.officers.shot/index.html</p>
<p>The shooter, Richard Poplawski, was certainly white, the four cops shot (3 dead) were unlikely to be black: their names are Paul Sciullo, Stephen Mayhle, Eric Kelly, and Timothy McManaway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <b>Officer Down Memorial Page</b> lists all U.S. law enforcement personnel killed while on duty, including photos. Those above names could easily be checked and matched on the link below.  </p>
<p>The last four cops making the memorial page are those related to the Lakewood story. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A White man shot four Black police officers earlier this year in Nashville&#8221;<br>
James I do not know of any black officers killed in Nashville but I do know about 2 white officers killed there by Black Panthers</p>
<p>Officer Thomasson and Officer Thomas Johnson were shot and killed after Officer Johnson stopped a vehicle at 15th Avenue and Herman Street that was wanted in connection with passing false money orders. As Officer Johnson exited his patrol car the occupants of the vehicle opened fire with a 30-30 rifle, striking him in the chest.</p>
<p>As Officer Thomasson arrived on the scene to backup Officer Johnson he was also shot. Officer Thomasson succumbed to his wounds two months later. The five suspects fled the scene but were all apprehended within several months. The ensuing investigation revealed that the five suspects were connected to the radical Black Panther group.</p>

<p>Anon #49 posts:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What surprises me is that no one on this thread has mentioned that this is the second time this year that a black has murdered four police officers at once. Has everyone already forgotten the Oakland police murders on March 21?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No.  I immediately thought of them.</p>
<p>I also remember the reaction of the black community to the killing of White police officers, and expect it will happen with this case as well, if it hasn&rsquo;t already:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The real occasion for a comeback of the O.J. Simpson acquittal sack dance was the murder of four white police officers in Oakland, California. </p>
<p>A friend in law enforcement in the Bay Area wrote me,</p>
<p>There were massive parties all over Oakland celebrating the shooting that night. During the interviews on TV there were 20 or 30 people in the background screaming &#8216;**** the police!&rsquo; and &#8216;They got what they deserved!&rsquo; </p>
<p>Bay View, a radical rag which calls itself a &#8216;National Black Newspaper,&rsquo; celebrates the mass murder as &#8216;what some in the Black community see as a day of heroic resistance against the police,&rsquo; under the headline, &#8216;Police 2, Oakland residents 4.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycuz8h6" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ycuz8h6</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the msm reporting these celebrations  &mdash;  celebrations of a black killing Whites, in fact the msm hardly covered the March shootings OR this more recent police massacre. I suspect after today, this case will be put down the memory hole, as was the first one.</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt that the msm and blacks hate Whites and feel their lives are worthless?</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the Internet, I would know little about either of these cases  &mdash;  and I live in California.</p>

		<p>I consider Huckabee to be the single most dangerous politician in the country. One of the most things government should do is protect citizens from the violent criminal element. All violent criminals should be eliminated from general society either by long prison sentences or execution depending on the crime. There should be no such thing as parole for dangerous criminals.</p>
<p>Huckabee released over 1,000 dangerous criminals out on the streets so they could be free to harm their next victims. Many say Huckabee did this to gain political favor as being &#8220;compassionate&#8221;, But since he released such an unusually large number of criminals I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if there is not something darker and truly evil in Huckabee&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p> Huckabee might have some type of twisted criminal fetish Or perhaps he likes the whole idea of having more dangerous predators in circulation. He may secretly find excitement in the fact that good law abiding citizens are at higher risk of being harmed because of his decisions. No matter what he was thinking it is very important that we never forget about this and that his political career is finished.   </p>

<p>From the article &#8220;List of 2008 homicides in Seattle&#8221; from the Seattle PI</p>
<p>selected from the list of the 28 Seattle homicides in 2008&hellip;.</p>
<p>Allen Joplin, Jan. 4   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>De&rsquo;Che Morrison, Jan. 10   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Maurice &#8220;Moe&#8221; Allen Jr., Jan. 26   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Degene Barecha, Jan. 30   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Perry Henderson, Feb. 6   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Stephan Dwaine Stewart, April 2   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Eldora Earlycutt, July 4   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>James Paroline, July 10   &mdash;   white killed by black</p>
<p>Troy Peters, July 22   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Pierre Lapoint, Aug. 5   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Jane Kariuki, Oct. 16   &mdash;   woman of unknown race killed by black man named Christel D. Murphy</p>
<p>Quincy S. Coleman, Oct. 31   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Edward McMichael, the &#8220;Tuba Man&#8221;, Nov. 3   &mdash;   white killed by multiple blacks</p>
<p>Nathaniel Lee Thomas, Nov. 23   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>So by my count blacks (8% of Seattle) were the killers in at least half (that&rsquo;s at least 50%) of the murders in the Seattle area in 2008. At least five of the other murderers were latinos.</p>
<p>The numbers are actually worse for 2009 and approach the 85% mark. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The hostile atmosphere created by four young White officers going about their business clearly provoked the future Rhodes scholar/NBA star/brain surgeon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, there was something these officers must have done to provoke him. Maybe one of them gave him a disrespectful look or glance. That&rsquo;s more than any black man should have to stand for. A hate crime right there.  Kno&rsquo; w&rsquo;ham sayin&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was really a &#8220;good boy&#8221; at heart, who was about to enter medical school and was working hard at &#8220;turning his life around.&#8221;  Now, this promising young man&rsquo;s life has been cut short, a terrible loss  - all for nothing, all because of four disrespectful white police officers!</p>
<p>As a result of this senseless tragedy, one valuable life has been lost. How much more does the black community have to tolerate?</p>
<p>If, perchance,  my above assumption proves incorrect, I am sure the Revs. Al &amp; Jesse, Inc. will find some other angle to play.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason we didn&rsquo;t hear or read about it is because it didn&rsquo;t happen.  If it did happen, we would still be hearing about it, the ADL and the SPLC would order the FBI and every other three- and four-letter Federal agency to scour the white shooter&rsquo;s life history to look for anything the SPLC and ADL can raise money about.</p>
