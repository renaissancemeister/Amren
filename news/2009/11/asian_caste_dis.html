<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/nov/11/caste-discrimination-uk-report">Asian Caste Discrimination Rife in UK, Says Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Jones, Guardian (Manchester), November 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Caste discrimination is rife in the UK, with more than half of those from traditionally lower-status Asian backgrounds finding themselves victims of prejudice and abuse, according to a report published today.</p>
<p>The study, co-ordinated by the Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance (Acda), suggests that the caste system is still widespread and affects tens of thousands of people in the workplace, the classroom and even the doctor&rsquo;s surgery.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent of the 300 people surveyed said they had been discriminated against because of their caste, while 79% said they did not think the police would understand if they tried to report a caste-related &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Almost half of the respondents (45%) said they had either been treated negatively by co-workers or had comments made about their caste. Nine per cent felt they had been passed over for promotion, and 10% said they had been paid less because of their caste. A further 5% said they had experienced threatening behaviour because of their caste.</p>
<p>One woman said she had been demoted from her job at a radio station after her manager discovered her caste background, while one bus company decided to reorganise shifts so that a &#8220;higher caste&#8221; inspector would not have to work alongside a &#8220;lower caste&#8221; bus driver.</p>
<p>The classroom also appears to be subject to caste divides: 7% of those surveyed said they had been the victims of threatening behaviour while aged under 12 at school, with another 16% suffering verbal caste abuse. According to the study, 10% of those responsible for caste discrimination against under-12s were teachers, and 42% fellow pupils.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly reported forms of discrimination is caste-related name-calling. Almost three quarters (71%) of those questioned in the survey identified themselves as members of the Dalit community. Dalits, who were formerly known as Untouchables because of their low caste status, are sometimes referred to abusively as chuhra and chamar.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Such] names [are] as derogatory as calling a black person a nigger, anyone from the subcontinent of Indo-Pakistani diaspora Paki, or someone of Jewish extraction a kike,&#8221; says the report. &#8220;These names are associated with hereditary work such as scavenging and working with leather  &mdash;  occupations regarded as beneath &#8216;caste Hindus&rsquo;. These names are deliberately used to offend and provoke. They are hurtful and exceedingly offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of respondents also reported being asked  &mdash;  directly or indirectly  &mdash;  about their caste background by their family doctor, nurse or a community nurse. One elderly woman felt her care worker had discriminated against her on caste grounds, while a physiotherapist was also alleged to have refused to treat someone of low caste.</p>
<p>The report says that the significant number of doctors from the Indian subcontinent now indicated &#8220;a potential for caste discrimination occurring in the healthcare sector&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Acda hopes its findings will persuade the government to amend the equality bill to make caste discrimination illegal.</p>
<p>Although the issue was raised over the summer when the bill was at the committee stage, a caste discrimination amendment was not added as there was not enough evidence on the matter.</p>
<p>The report  &mdash;  which was produced in collaboration with focus groups and academics from the University of Hertfordshire, the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University  &mdash;  aims to provide a snapshot of caste discrimination in 21st century Britain.</p>
<p>The study concludes: &#8220;There is clear evidence from the survey and the focus groups that the caste system has been imported into the UK with the Asian diaspora and that the associated caste discrimination affects citizens in ways beyond personal choices and social interaction. There is a danger that if the UK government does not effectively accept and deal with the issue of caste discrimination the problem will grow unchecked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allowing such a situation to develop, it adds, would undermine the &#8220;values of fairness and equality of treatment&#8221; that the government promotes.</p>
<p>Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, said: &#8220;Caste discrimination, like other forms of discrimination, needs to be outlawed. This is the evidence that will prove the case for its inclusion in the equality bill.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Are the Brits supposed to care about this? I&rsquo;ve worked with many Indians (in Australia), their caste and colour discrimination was obvious to everyone who watched them, in fact we used to get quite a bit of amusement out of it. </p>
<p>It would be even more amusing to watch them trying to squirm out of accusations of caste prejudice.</p>

		<p>Of course these are folks from the Indian sub-continent being discriminated against by other folks also from the Indian sub-continent. IN ENGLAND. NOT white English discriminating against those of the lower castes or even the caste-less [Dalits].</p>
<p>The caste system has been around for how long, 4,000 years or so? One century of equal opportunity being preached will not eliminate the basics of &#8220;eternal&#8221; India that all these &#8220;spiritual&#8221; westerners are so enthralled with. </p>

		<p>India was among the first countries to condemn Apartheid in South Africa, criticizing the evil idea of White dominance over Blacks, Coloureds and Indians, including Ghandi.</p>
<p>The word caste itself is homologous with any of three different indigenous terms. Varna, which was an ancient, all-India classification system consisting of a fourfold division of society, perhaps arose out of a blending of the nomadic Warrior culture of Aryans with the settled urban, agrarian culture of the Indus Valley. The religious text Rig Veda spells out and justifies this stratification system, putting the Brahman or priest at the top, followed by the Kshatriya or warrior, Vaisya or landowner and trader, and Shudra or artisan and servant, in that order. Later a fifth varna of Untouchables developed, called Panchama, to accommodate intercaste offspring. The word caste may also be coterminous with the word jati, which is a hereditary occupational unit. Hindu texts say that jatis, of which there are several thousand, emerged out of Intermarriages between varnas. Modern theory holds that jatis developed as other social groups like tribes or those practicing a new craft or occupational skill became integrated into the classic varna system. This process continues today as groups on the fringes of Hindu society become part of it by claiming a jati designation. Lastly, caste may refer to gotra, which is an exogamous descent group within a jati. It may be anchored territorially, and its members may hold property in common. Underpinning the entire system are notions of purity and pollution. Words for these two ideas occur in every Indian language. Each term has a certain amount of semantic fluidity. Pure means &#8220;clean, spiritually meritorious, holy&#8221;; impure means &#8220;unclean, defiled,&#8221; and even &#8220;sinful.&#8221; The structural distance between castes is measured in terms of purity and pollution; higher castes are pure in their occupation, diet, and life-style. Caste rules govern intercaste relations, determining the social and physical distance that people of different castes have to maintain from each other and their rights and obligations toward others. An equally important feature of caste rank is the notion of serving and being served, of giving and receiving. Castes may be ranked by the balance between the intercaste transactions in which one caste is a giver and those in which it is a receiver of goods, services, gifts, or purely Spiritual merit. The seeming contradiction between the power and position of the Brahman versus that of the king or the Politically and economically dominant caste can be resolved in light of the transactional aspect of caste, which creates varied realms of differentiation and ranking.</p>

<p>While Afghanistan comes from the &#8220;Afghan&#8221; ethnicity and means &#8220;land of the Afghans,&#8221; Pakistan has a different ethimology. It doesn&rsquo;t mean &#8220;land of the Paki&#8221;.</p>

		<p>actually, &#8220;Pakistan&#8221; is an acronym symbolizing the several provinces/regions/nations (most notably Punjab and Sind) that got thrown together into a single country. So it&rsquo;s not the land of the pakis&hellip; Also, well, to call people from the US &#8220;usians&#8221; would also be impolite, which is not to say that some people don&rsquo;t use this term. I guess it&rsquo;s same with &#8220;pakis&#8221;.</p>

<p>According to Hindus they are all unclean &#8216;mlechas&rsquo; or Barbarians with no culture. Trust me, I know many Indians who believe that only Hindus have any culture at all while non-Hindus are uncultured.</p>

		<p>4 Dravidian Pride: White nationalists are not ACCUSING Indians of racism (castism?), we simply wish that more people would recognize that discrimination in favor of your own kind is normal and healthy.  We point to Indians because our own leftists love to crow about how spiritual and all that Ghandi blather, and refuse to acknowledge that non-Whites have racial issues among each other.  This finger is not in your eye, Dravidian Pride, it&rsquo;s in the eye of those White multi-cults who pretend that racism etc is something only found among Whites.<br/>
     <br/>
12 Human: Hindus world view requires them to fit everyone into a caste niche.  I think that they tend to mentally put us in the caste that our occupation would suit back home.  I&rsquo;ve seen a Hindu&rsquo;s attitude change visibly when they found that the scruffy man in dirty working clothes was actually a teacher.  </p>

		<p>You know, this is sad, because I just read in Paramahansa Yogananda&rsquo;s &#8220;Autobiography of a Yogi&#8221; that in 1947, India was working to reinstate the practice of caste being ASSIGNED to each individual according to their natural proclivities, and banning the &#8220;caste by birth&#8221; system.  Originally, caste was to put people into groups according to their interests and abilities, so they could work together in harmony.  Clearly Yogananda&rsquo;s hopes did not come to fruition.  Also, he came to the U.S. in 1920 to share Yoga with the West, hoping to create ties of harmony between the East and West.  That too has fallen by the wayside, apparently.  What a shame.  Yogananda was a true saint, and his Self-Realization Fellowship path is an excellent one for those who practice it devotedly.  I wish it could have made more of a difference for everyone.</p>
