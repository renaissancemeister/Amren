<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLE520367">Violence in Marseille Over Algeria, Egypt Soccer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, November 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rioters smashed shop windows, hurled stones at police and set fire to several boats moored in the southern French port of Marseille after Egypt beat Algeria in a soccer World Cup qualifying match on Saturday.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said more than 500 officers were deployed in the centre of Marseille, an often volatile city with a large North African immigrant population and football supporters who are considered among the most passionate in France.</p>
<p>Egypt won the match, which was played in Cairo, 2-0.</p>
<p>Police said they had made eight arrests, mostly for throwing objects, while one man was arrested for setting fire to a rubbish bin.</p>
<p>At least six boats were damaged and two were sunk when a fire was sparked by a smoke bomb of the kind seen frequently in French football stadiums.</p>
<p>Police said the trouble began after youths of Algerian origin reacted in frustration when Egypt scored towards the end of the first half of match, in which the two teams were vying to qualify for next year&rsquo;s World Cup.<br>

		<p>Once again, Diversity is our Greatest Strength, because it brings new perspectives to the table and new ways of doing things.  Multiculturalism enriches us all because it fills our neighborhoods with &#8220;color and vibrancy.&#8221;  Really, how did France ever get along prior to immigration &amp; multiculturalism?  Before massive Third World immigration, France must have been a very boring, uncultured place.  Now, finally France is getting some interesting culture!</p>

		<p>Think of the cost of 500 policemen to maintain order for something as frivolous as a soccer game that didn&rsquo;t even take place in France.</p>
<p>This was a game between two Moslem countries! It was played in Cairo and <i>had <b>nothing</b> to do with France</i> whatsoever.   Imagine if it had been a game against a European country, and the Europeans won!   The Algerians would have torn Marseille apart.  Well, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time &hellip;</p>
<p>And these are supposed to be good &#8220;Frenchmen&#8221; now.  After all, they were born on French soil, weren&rsquo;t they?   Ha, ha.   It&rsquo;s clear who they think they they are and where their loyalties lie.  </p>
<p>France has imported a nest of snakes and now has the dilemma of what to do with them.  Meanwhile, the politicians refuse to see the reality, and nobody is allowed to say it (just look at what happened to Brigitte Bardot).</p>

		<p>I was having dinner with a friend of mine and her two children last weekend. She was in the kitchen making us a delicious Sunday roast when her daughter came to me with an atlas and asked where France was. She said to me that she knew it was in Africa somewhere but she couldn&rsquo;t find it. I found this comment interesting (and highly amusing) so I asked her why she thought it was in Africa. She innocently told me that it must be in Africa because whenever she sees France in the evening news she always sees Africans.</p>

		<p>Iwork every day with a French lady, her home town is Marseilles. Most of her family is in Nice at this point, she goes there often.  Her American sons had begged for years to go to a &#8220;home game&#8221;, because they had never really seen French soccer. They went to this one.<br>
Suffice to say, she is NOT a happy camper right now.  In fact, she&rsquo;s extremely upset.  She was extremely afraid, she thought her young sons would be killed there.  What she described to me was truly awful.<br>
She is afraid for her country right now.  She is afraid that her sons want to go to college there, and marry French girls.<br>
They are afraid of everything about France, and particularly, her ancestral home, after this experience.<br>
How messed up is that?</p>

		<p>I am one of those people who have visited Paris and fell in love with it, so I am interested in things French, even though there is much variety between the Mediterranean Midi, the Celtic Bretagne, and the frugal Normandie.</p>
<p>I have talked with people from France who say that they once looked down on Americans for their race problems, but that now they (people from France) understand, and are quite apologetic about disparaging their Anglo cousins.</p>
<p>The same types of people also tell me to stay away from Marseilles, because of the Africans and Islamic types.</p>
<p>I think Jill is correct in thinking there will be a second French revolultion.</p>

		<p>Anyone surprised? Sounds a lot like what happens in LA when the Lakers win or lose a championship. Or what happens in PG county MD when UMD plays Duke (win or lose, home or away, championship need not be at stake).</p>
<p><i>Imagine what would happen if the Detroit Lions won or lost the Superbowl? It would be &ldquo;devils night&rdquo; time ten and there are plenty of abandoned houses in the Detroit area to torch.</i></p>
<p>LOL. I was surprised the local diversity didn&rsquo;t do all of that a few weeks ago when the Lions snapped their 19 game losing streak, beating the Redskins. After all, it might be their last chance (Lions currently 1-8 with the rest of the season not looking up).</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Probably.   Either that, or the two World Wars. I&rsquo;d say all combined. The 2nd WW, and its vicious aftermath, just mopped up what the Revolution left unfinished.  They&rsquo;re still mopping up and suppressing the tattered remains of the right today (witness their treatment of LePen and Bardot).</p>
<p>Since The Revolution (the big one), there has been another revolution or at least rioting in France roughly every 20-30 years. In other words: every generation.  There isn&rsquo;t much left of &#8220;the French nation&#8221; by now.  In a place like Paris they&rsquo;re completely outnumbered &hellip; just as Englishmen are a rare breed today in London, or Dutchmen in Amsterdam.  Et cetera!  And forget about Marseille   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s an extension of North Africa.</p>

<p>I refuse to accept that.</p>
<p>When I was in Europe, I saw people in France, Germany, and England all very interested in their history. Much, much more than Americans, who seem driven to re-invent their history every few years, and to tear down historical buildings and monuments to build fast-food joints.</p>
<p>No, ghw and others, America will fall to multiculturalism long before Europe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Europe will.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Cher Monsieur:  I sincerely hope you are right (at least about Europe, though not about America). I was speaking mainly about the big cities, which I thought I made clear. The small towns, as always, are another story. It&rsquo;s the same in the USA.<br>
Also, there are plenty, plenty of fast food joints in Europe, including their own local brands, all of which are packed   &mdash;   with Europeans!  And  there are plenty of Europeans who know very little about their own history and couldn&rsquo;t care less. Many a time I&rsquo;ve asked a question and just got a baffled gaze. It turned out I knew more about their history than they did. (Again, that doesn&rsquo;t apply to all.) Still, I&rsquo;m on your side; I&rsquo;m rooting for them, not against them. But they will have to wake up and do something PDQ.  Let&rsquo;s hope they do.<br>
PS. Have you been in Marseille?  I have!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>As for &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; &hellip;In fairness to Monsieur, it must be acknowledged that it&rsquo;s mainly America which is pushing multi-culturalism on the world. That&rsquo;s the American &#8220;thing&#8221;, our particular national obsession right now. </p>
<p>The French pattern has traditionally been the reverse:  France emphazises full national <i>integration,</i> one culture, one language, indifference to race or origin, and making everyone a good Frenchman.  But it isn&rsquo;t working!  And that should be obvious to any Frenchman with eyes to see. How many riots will it take?  Still, they cling desperately to the old national ideal of one language, one people, one culture.  </p>
<p>The black Africans might try harder to fit in and imagine that they&rsquo;re now magically &#8220;French&#8221;,  but the Moslems don&rsquo;t want any part of that. They have their own culture and habits, and they intend to preserve them. They don&rsquo;t want to be Frenchmen, eating pork and drinking wine.  Sinful! Disgusting!</p>

<p>Oh please.  The &#8220;evening news&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t <i>only</i> show Africans.  I take it the purported incident took place in an English-speaking country, so the girl would have to be aware that Africans also exist outside Africa.  If she was intellectually curious enough to turn to an atlas then it probably wasn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;d looked in one; in which case it seems incredible that she wouldn&rsquo;t have at least previously glanced at Europe and seen &#8220;FRANCE&#8221; staring right at her.  Finally, do kids these days still refer to atlases, or would they head straight for the net?</p>
