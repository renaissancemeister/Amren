<h1>Frederick County Sheriff Worried About Montco Gangs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Suderman, Washington Examiner, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Montgomery County&rsquo;s relatively welcoming stance on illegal immigration may be attracting gangs that are causing problems for its stricter neighbor, said Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He pointed to two recent armed robberies in Frederick by Montgomery County members of the Latin Kings, a notoriously violent street gang that typically has illegal immigrants as members, as examples of what he said could be a growing problem.</p>
<p>In an August armed robbery of the Philly Cheesesteak Factory on Urbana Pike, one of the robbers hit a victim in the head with a hammer, police said. And a store owner was shot at after an armed robbery by some of the same suspects nine days later in Point of Rocks, according to news accounts.</p>
<p>The suspects then fled to Montgomery County, where three were caught soon after, police said. Criminal investigators later obtained indictments against four teenagers and a 20-year-old who police say were involved in one or both robberies.</p>
<p>Jenkins said he was concerned that the Montgomery County Police Department&rsquo;s policies could be making the county an attractive base for violent gangs to commit crimes in neighboring Frederick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Montgomery County allows its officers to contact ICE only if they arrest someone for violent or handgun-related crimes and not based on an &#8220;individual&rsquo;s legal status and/or perceived gang affiliation.&#8221; No such limits exist for Frederick County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies.</p>
<p>Montgomery County&rsquo;s rank-and-file police officers are &#8220;disgusted&#8221; at what they perceive to be a politically motivated immigration policy that ties their hands as law enforcement officials, according to Walt Bader, past president of the Fraternal Order of Police union.</p>
<p>A report issued by Northern Virginia law enforcement officials last week said anecdotal evidence suggested that anti-gang policing measures in Virginia, including referring suspected illegal immigrants to ICE, had led to gangs fleeing to Maryland and the District, where immigration enforcement isn&rsquo;t as strict.</p>
<p>But Montgomery County officials and immigrants rights groups argue that aggressive immigration tactics by local police departments lead to a loss of trust from immigrants, the vast majority of whom aren&rsquo;t in gangs.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, October 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force just released a report which claims that due to tougher laws and a concerted effort by law enforcement, many illegal alien gangs are leaving Virginia for the safe havens of Maryland.</p>
<p>The report said: &#8220;Many gang members from Northern Virginia are moving or driving to Prince George&rsquo;s and other Maryland counties, into the District of Columbia or further south and west into Virginia to avoid dealing with police departments that are unrelenting in their efforts to keep gangs under control.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, as a direct result of Maryland&rsquo;s continued lax attitude toward illegal immigration, the state&rsquo;s sanctuary cities, and lack of cooperation with federal authorities, violent crimes committed by illegal aliens have recently soared.</p>
<p>Maryland is also one of a handful of states which issues driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal aliens. Additionally, the Maryland State Board of Education recently announced that they will not allow county school districts to count the number of illegal alien students registered in their respective districts.</p>
<p>Several high profile murders committed by illegal aliens in Montgomery County, MD forced city officials to change their policy in reporting criminal aliens to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, as Judicial Watch recently pointed-out, Montgomery County police only report illegal aliens to the feds when they have been arrested for a very serious crime such as rape or murder.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens arrested for burglary, simple assault, and most weapons violations are still not reported to ICE for deportation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Maryland State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s Office, there are 40 active gangs in Montgomery County with a total of about 1,150 members.</p>
<p>Chief of the FBI&rsquo;s MS-13 National Gang Task Force, Aaron Escorza recently said that gangs &#8220;know what law enforcement is doing. Word of mouth spreads quickly.&#8221; Illegal alien gangs are now spreading the word that Maryland is part of the &#8220;wild wild East.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service has listed the following cities and counties that have &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; sanctuary policies in place:</p>
<p>-Anchorage, Alaska<br>
-Fairbanks, Alaska<br>
-Chandler, Arizona<br>
-Tucson, Arizona<br>
-Fresno, California<br>
-Los Angeles, California<br>
-San Bernardino, California<br>
-San Diego, California<br>
-San Jose, California<br>
-Sonoma County, California<br>
-Denver, Colorado<br>
-Durango, Colorado<br>
-Lafayette, Colorado<br>
-Chicago, Illinois<br>
-Cicero, Illinois<br>
-Evanston, Illinois<br>
-Cambridge, Massachusetts<br>
-Orleans, Massachusetts<br>
-Portland, Maine<br>
-Baltimore, Maryland<br>
-Takoma Park, Maryland<br>
-Ann Arbor, Michigan<br>
-Detroit, Michigan<br>
-Minneapolis, Minnesota<br>
-Durham, North Carolina<br>
-Albuquerque, New Mexico<br>
-Aztec, New Mexico<br>
-Rio Ariba County, New Mexico<br>
-Santa Fe, New Mexico<br>
-Rio Arriba County, New Mexico<br>
-Sante Fe, New Mexico<br>
-New York, New York<br>

-Austin, Texas<br>
-El Cenizo, Texas<br>
-Houston, Texas<br>
-Katy, Texas<br>
-Seattle, Washington<br>
-Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Both Alaska and Oregon have state-wide policies that forbid state agencies from using resources to enforce federal immigration law. Oregon law, however, does provide an exception to allow law enforcement officers to share information on immigration status with federal authorities with those arrested for criminal offenses.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The Congressional Research Service has listed the following cities and counties that have &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; sanctuary policies in place:&#8221;</p>
<p>Any crime or economic catastrophes that occur in those cities is deserved by the corrupt politicians in charge.  Too bad the alien criminals can&rsquo;t be relocated to their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>But, the situation will continue to get worse as the economy declines, forcing the mestizos to go into panic mode because of an absence of available jobs, and the government giveaways will stop as well.</p>
<p>It has been forecast by several top notch economists&hellip;.Celente, Roubini, Schiff, Ferguson, as just a few examples&hellip;..that before this second wave of forclosures is over even civil service pensions are going to be denied for lack of funds.</p>
<p>And if pensions are denied, welfare and medicaid are a certainty to fall before them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the media and government propagandists into believing we are in a recovery.  We are in a temporary false recovery brought about by the &#8220;cash for clunkers&#8221; and a bit of stimulous money.  Wall street, as usual is making money, but the average person is not.  In fact his jobs continue to decline on account of layoffs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a jobless recovery.  This entire economy is consumer driven.  Fewer jobs means fewer consumers, and those that are still working are holding onto as much money as they can.</p>
<p>Please believe me.  This present upsurge in the market will end and the next sound you hear will be the entire Western economy crashing.  Big time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no exaggeration.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;wiberals&#8221; of Montgomery County, home of the Shrivers, are worried about losing &#8220;trust&#8221; of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. In other words, look the other way about the status of the gangbangers so the &#8220;nice&#8221; immigrants will cooperate. Well how much have they cooperated. Not much, since the MS13 and Latin Kings grow wherever &#8220;immigrants&#8221; appear. And what kind of immigrants are these? Legal or illegal? The black exec of Montgomery County, Isaiah Legget, a wiberal if there ever was one, sees nothing but nice brown votes. </p>
<p>Of course this moron doesn&rsquo;t realize the Latinos are taking jobs from the black &#8220;youth&#8221; of Montgomery County. The parents may be affirmative action middle class employees of the fed agencies in the county, but the kids are falling back into ghettospeak. They won&rsquo;t even get affirmative action jobs, they are so illiterate. More illiterate than the &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. </p>
<p>We should deport both the blacks and the immigrants, shut down the federal agencies, and give productive white workers a nice fat tax cut (named after Martin Luther King, to rub it in and to flaunt the irony).</p>
