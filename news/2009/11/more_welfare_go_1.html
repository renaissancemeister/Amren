<h1><a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/oct/27/more-welfare-going-parents-here-illegally/">More Welfare Going to Parents Here Illegally</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy Pratt, Las Vegas Sun, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If approved for assistance, the Silvas will belong to the fastest-growing category of families in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Bearing the confusing government label of &#8220;non-qualified non-citizens,&#8221; this category refers to families with parents who are not U.S. citizens and children who are.</p>
<p>Since the recession began in late 2007, the average monthly caseload of these families has grown 96 percent, according to state records. About 4,250 of these families of mixed immigration status were on the program&rsquo;s rolls in September, making it the second-largest category in TANF, after single-parent households.</p>
<p>It is also the only category in the program where parents apply in their children&rsquo;s name, as opposed to applying in their own. TANF gives monthly checks to the families based on income and the children&rsquo;s status as citizens and does not require parents to demonstrate that they are in the United States legally.</p>
<p>No one has studied the phenomenon, but Christie D. Batson, an assistant professor of sociology at UNLV who has researched immigrant families, figures the exploding numbers may have at least two causes. Children of immigrants have long been one of the demographic groups getting the least amount of social services, despite showing great need, Batson said. This is because illegal immigrant parents often don&rsquo;t know about the benefits, or are afraid they could be deported if they seek them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the past few years there has been a push to better inform these parents, by social service agencies and nonprofits,&#8221; Batson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another reflection of the withering economy, the number of households with two parents seeking TANF has also exploded. Enrollment under that category has increased 69 percent since late 2007.</p>
<p>Stagliano [Gary Stagliano, deputy administrator of Nevada&rsquo;s Welfare and Supportive Services Division] said this increase may show how the loss of one or two jobs has dropped many families from the middle class in recent months. Many are applying for welfare benefits for the first time. And contrary to historical patterns, many don&rsquo;t need training to obtain a new job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Batson said Hispanic immigrants in particular &#8220;place a cultural importance on work,&#8221; adding, &#8220;There is a predisposition that work is important, and they don&rsquo;t tend to stay out of work for a long time.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We need hard working American families. Why don&rsquo;t American families get such great treatment when people who aren&rsquo;t even supposed to be in this country in the first place get a free ride?</p>

		<p>What a sad and pathetic story this is. When the very people WE elect do more for INVADERS than they do for their own people and country. Now they even want to lower or take away healthcare benifits WE have EARNED over the years to give these INVADERS even more. Go to Mexico and see what they give you for FREE there, I can tell you this it won&rsquo;t even be the Time Of Day.</p>

		<p>Perhaps their MEN may place a cultural importance on work. Their women are rarely seen employed, as their cultural importance is on dropping babies and eating.</p>
<p>That sound you hear is your taxes going up and up.</p>

		<p>Impossible. Article 30 of the mexican constitution says that you if your mother is a mexican, you are a mexican citizen whereever you are born. Let the mexican government take care of their own children.</p>

<p>This is total NONSENSE. It is my experience that these immigrant kids families use the most welfare. If I got a dollar for every time I&rsquo;m around some non-English speaking &#8220;immigrant&#8221; pulling out their food stamps or medicaid card, I&rsquo;d be rich!!!!</p>

		<p>Gotta LOVE this comment on the Las Vegas Sun article</p>

 I have just accepted a position with Health and Human Services (Welfare division). Rest assured that the bigotry and bile spewed here wont effect my work to help people in need. I grew up here in Las Vegas and for some reason it still astonishes me how much people hate. Look, the federal govt. wants those in need to get food stamps, help with rent and utilities. Its not only for illegals but for the disabled, and elderly. Most of the programs can only be drawn on for five years and then thats it. You can&rsquo;t even go to another state and sign up for prior benefits. So in effect there is no more &#8220;generational welfare&#8221;. There are a lot of people out there in need, legal and otherwise and our govt. must be there to help. Remember, &#8220;Nothing is promised today&#8221;. You could be going through those welfare doors tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>This traitor says it all&hellip;&#8221;I have just accepted a position with Health and Human Services (Welfare division)&#8221;&hellip;so now I can wrap my PARASITE existence on the guise of compassion for all the po people.  This hits at the heart of the American cowards who not only support this Mexican invasion, but feel so good justifying their guvmnunt plantation handout. GTH LV4LIFE!</p>

<p>Go to the rants &amp; raves section of the los angeles craigslist to see more of this insanity by self-appointed &#8220;anti-racists&#8221;</p>
<p>http://losangeles.craigslist.org/cgi-bin/personals.cgi?category=rnr</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t reason with these people no matter how truthful &amp; logical you are.  They feel morally superior by catering to &#8220;invaders&#8221;.  If you don&rsquo;t agree with their mindset, you of course are living a miserable life full of hatred in your heart.</p>
<p>Of course, most of them are non-whites, but an alarming amount are self-loathing whites.  For the whites, the only thing that will get through to them is when they&rsquo;re out on the street with no job and no future.  Sorry, but then there will be no welfare to fall back on, you just gave it all to the Mexicans.</p>

<p>I believe it was T.E.Lawrence who said, paraphrasing &#8220;an idea can be reasoned with, a conviction is best shot&#8221; This quote and many pertinent others are at the end of the book &#8220;Civil War II&#8221; a must read for amren posters/readers. As always, GOD will not help us.</p>
