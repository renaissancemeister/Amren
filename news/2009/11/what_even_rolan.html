<h1><a href="https://scifiwire.com/2009/11/5-best-things-2012s-direc.php">What Even Roland Emmerich Won&rsquo;t Destroy: An Islamic Landmark</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Lee, Sci Fi Wire, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Roland Emmerich&rsquo;s upcoming global demolition derby movie 2012, the director gets to indulge his passion for destroying landmarks on a world scale.</p>
<p>In previous movies, he&rsquo;s destroyed the Empire State Building and the White House (Independence Day), sent a giant monster into the middle of Manhattan (Godzilla), blown away the famous Hollywood sign and the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles (The Day After Tomorrow) and savaged New York again by flooding and then freezing it (also The Day After Tomorrow).</p>
<p>In 2012, he takes on landmarks in Rome, Rio de Janeiro and, yes, Washington, but there is one place even he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to obliterate. We caught up with Emmerich in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he told us why he chose various landmarks to lay waste in 2012, and about the one that got away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sistine Chapel in the Vatican</p>
<p>That includes the famous frescoed ceiling by Michelangelo depicting Adam touching fingers with God.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always try to come up with what makes sense for the story, you know?&#8221; Emmerich says. &#8220;And it&rsquo;s not only about the destruction. It has to kind of stand for something. One of my favorite pieces of art is Michelangelo&rsquo;s Sistine Chapel: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reaches out to Adam, and the crack goes through it. It&rsquo;s just an interesting kind of notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in the Vatican</p>
<p>&#8220;Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don&rsquo;t [we] have the church fall on people&rsquo;s head?&#8221; Emmerich said. He added: &#8220;The whole Vatican kind of tips and kind of rolls over the people. It said something, because in the story, some people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. believe in praying and prayer, and they pray in front of the church, and it&rsquo;s probably the wrong thing, what they would do in that situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The one that got away</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Emmerich was thinking of something even more explosive: the Kaaba, the cube-shaped building at the heart of Mecca, the focus of prayers and the Islamic pilgrimage called the Hajj; it is one of Islam&rsquo;s holiest sites.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wanted to do that, I have to admit,&#8221; Emmerich says. &#8220;But my co-writer Harald said I will not have a fatwa on my head because of a movie. And he was right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have to all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the Western world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think about this. You can actually .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Christian symbols fall apart, but if you would do this with [an] Arab symbol, you would have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a fatwa, and that sounds a little bit like what the state of this world is. So it&rsquo;s just something which I kind of didn&rsquo;t [think] was [an] important element, anyway, in the film, so I kind of left it out.&#8221;<br>

For what it&rsquo;s worth, at least he&rsquo;s honest about why he made the choice he did.</p>

		<p> The Muslims and American blacks are alike in one way, at least: They seem to know instinctively that you can make Whitey blink by threatening severe bodily harm, whether in the form of a &#8220;long, hot summer&#8221; in the city, or of a &#8220;fatwa,&#8221; that is an authorization to fanatics to commit murder.</p>
<p> This gutless wonder Roland Emmerich should have gone out of his way to &#8220;destroy&#8221; the Kaaba to prove to the radical Muslims that he would not be intimidated by them. But, on the contrary, he didn&rsquo;t even let it get that far; he let himself be intimidated by his co-writer. At least Salman Rushdie had the guts to tweak Mohammed&rsquo;s nose, the consequences be damned.</p>

Actually, he wouldn&rsquo;t have destroyed anything at all. It&rsquo;s just a movie. </p>

		<p>Yes, I noticed this.</p>
<p>With popular culture, Hollywood, &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; laws - it comes down to real world reality that certain groups you don&rsquo;t insult, don&rsquo;t mess with.</p>
<p>There are still some White groups that are known not to &#8220;mess with them&#8221;:</p>
<p>Russians<br>
Southern Italians</p>
<p><br>
We White, Westerners must throw off so much education, wealth, ideas about &#8220;fairness&#8221; and we must become tough, brutal tribal people, like we once were.</p>
<p>So this Hollywood director who is presenting destruction of sacred Western Christian  sites&hellip;. where does he live?<br>
Where does he hang out?<br>
Who does he date?<br>
Does he have some family members we can talk to?</p>
<p>I suggest all Amren readers consider joining a White biker club - folks don&rsquo;t mess with us.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe such behavior coming from the guy who brought us the masterpiece Independence Day, which portrays a black man as the all-american good guy, dad, lover, fighter pilot, and ultimately savior of the world. Don&rsquo;t support this guy.</p>

		<p>I was disappointed that the medical facility in the Dallas area caved in to a Muslim doctor applying for a position. I had written them a congratulatory letter when they first stood up to the woman who wanted to continue to wear her headdress when the clinic has a clear &#8220;no hat&#8221; policy for employees. But all of a sudden there was a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; and the apologies flew thick and fast. Their &#8220;rules&#8221; will be examined. Now, she says she doesn&rsquo;t konw if she&rsquo;ll even accept a job! That clearly shows the clinic was a test case. They want nothing but to impose their will. To continue to control our country and our own laws, this must be stopped. We are in great danger from this element. I fear for my grandchildren. What kind of world will they grow up in if the once greatest nation on earth bows to this threat to our lives and liberties?</p>

		<p>Muslims with their goats and sheep, are going to turn the entire world into the middle east desert&hellip;just as depicted in Frank Herbert&rsquo;s &#8220;Dune&#8221; Goats and sheep graze in such a manner that the flora has no chance you seed the next generation of growth. They eat the roots and pull the root system out of the ground, e.g. DESERT!!</p>

		<p>If someone in the USA has a fatwa issued against them, say by a mullah from Saudi Arabia or Iran, then any potential Muslim assassins can be killed in self-defense. This is what differentiates us from virtually every other nation on Earth.</p>
