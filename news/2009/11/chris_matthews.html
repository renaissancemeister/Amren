<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The attacks on former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin took an interesting turn Wednesday when MSNBC&rsquo;s Chris Matthews suggested that racism is at the heart of her support.</p>
<p>Much like mainstream media coverage of this year&rsquo;s Tea Parties, Matthews and &#8220;Hardball&#8221; guests Norah O&rsquo;Donnell and Salon&rsquo;s Joan Walsh made an issue of how &#8220;white&#8221; the crowd was at a Palin book signing event in Michigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a largely white  &mdash;  almost no minorities in this crowd,&#8221; reported MSNBC&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Donnell live from the scene.</p>
<p>Matthews reiterated, &#8220;Well, they look like a white crowd to me,&#8221; later claiming, &#8220;I think there is a tribal aspect to this thing, in other words, white vs. other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walsh added, &#8220;I think you&rsquo;ve got that same kind of paranoid tea party, maybe even birther crowd that talks about the Constitution, without really understanding what they are talking about&#8221;:<blockquote>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Welcome back to HARDBALL {snip}</p>
<p>MSNBC&rsquo;s Norah O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s covering Palin&rsquo;s stop up in Grand Rapids tonight. And we also have Joan Walsh, who&rsquo;s editor-in-chief of Salon.com. {snip}</p>
<p>Norah, what are the people  &mdash;  can you find out what their belief is in Governor Palin? What is it they like about her, apparently?</p>
<p>NORAH O&rsquo;DONNELL, NBC CORRESPONDENT: {snip} This is a largely white  &mdash;  almost no minorities in this crowd. {snip}</p>
<p>MATTHEWS: Well, they look like a white crowd to me. Let&rsquo;s go back to Joan Walsh. Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it, but it is pretty monochromatic up there.</p>
<p>Joan, no surprise in terms of the ethnic nature of the people showing up. Nothing wrong with that. But it is a fact. Let me go to this intramural  &mdash;  the nastiness  &mdash;  and I want to get back to Norah on this, Norah covered the campaign and  &mdash;  the nastiness of this, the attacks on you might call them the &#8220;little people,&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>This is Orwellian. There are no minorities because they support Obama almsot 100% purely because of his race. There are no non-white faces there because they don&rsquo;t want to bethere. Yet this portrayed as white racism. Straight out of Animal Farm</p>

		<p>I would hope people are intelligent enough to see past the media manipulation going on here.  FOX or should I say FAUX News got into some hot water for portraying a huge turnout at her book signing only to find out it was footage from the 2008 presidential campaign.  Our hostile alien elites sense the anger in the general public and are deathly afraid of someone being elected to the White House who will not kowtow to them in the fashion they&rsquo;ve been accustomed to.  This is just a propaganda blitz aimed at rallying White America to her side as possibly the next Presidential candidate for 2012.  If America ever has any hope of even taking the first steps towards recovery then at the very minimum we need a candidate who will smash the Federal Reserve, limit immigration and enforce the border and remove all of our troops from the quagmire in the Middle East.  Sarah Palin won&rsquo;t do any of those things.  In fact she made it quite clear she didn&rsquo;t believe in deporting the illegal aliens living within our borders and she was also quite adept at prostituting herself before the foreign lobby machine.  America doesn&rsquo;t have alot of time left before we are completely submerged by the third world.  We can&rsquo;t afford to be distracted by the fake right or their rehashed race mixing puppet again.   </p>

		<p>Lol, Sarah Palin has to be one of the most dull-witted politicians around today; I would bet that she&rsquo;s even dimmer than Bush (jr.)&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why &#8216;white people&rsquo; would support her. It&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s actually going to deviate from the &#8216;orthodoxy&rsquo; that constrains both major parties. She&rsquo;s just playing the &#8216;partisan game,&rsquo; which doesn&rsquo;t offer anything to Euro-descended people of whatever variety. In fact, I would say that she&rsquo;s more of a feminist puppet than anything else   &mdash;   &#8216;puffing up&rsquo; the females in the US, giving them a sense of pride, arrogance, etc. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not nearly as important to waste time on discussing how they arrived at their illnesses than it is to determine the best way to get rid of them once and for all.</p>

		<p>Why is a black crowd never referred to as a black crowd? Yet a white crowd is seen by the progressives as racist? How can a crowd be racist? A crowd is a crowd. Now, maybe the actions of the crowd might be construed as racist.</p>
<p>Compare the Sarah book signing crowd to say.. the crowd that stormed Wal-Mart and killed a person or the crowd in the Burlington Coat factory when a crazy lady told them she would foot the bill.</p>
<p>Which crowd would these progressives prefer to be in? And you?</p>

		<p>Of course, because it was held at a book store, and most people there were expected or thought to buy a book.  Of course there would hardly be any blacks.  &#8220;The best way to hide something from a black man is to put it in a book and put the book in a library.&#8221;   &mdash;   Onion Horton, black St. Louis talk radio host</p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with white people supporting the political figure of their choice, why dwell on it at all? Isn&rsquo;t it &#8220;racist&#8221; to notice the racial composition of crowds, and to attribute &#8220;stereotypical&#8221; qualities or motives to them? </p>
<p>Of course Matthews disapproves of anything too white; otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t have taken time away from enjoying the Obama-inspired tingle running up his leg to complain.</p>

		<p>90+% of blacks supported Obama, but that isn&rsquo;t &#8220;tribal.&#8221;  No more than 50% of whites support Palin, but since non-whites avoid her like the plague (apparently), her supporters are &#8220;tribal,&#8221; and it&rsquo;s &#8220;whites vs. other.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if whites find themselves alone in supporting someone (or presumably, something), they have to abandon that someone (or something) or the media will portray them as &#8220;tribal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, nothing racist or tribal about this damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t &#8220;logic.&#8221;  Good thing the media has our best interests at heart.</p>

		<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t ask the question, he&rsquo;s not doing his job, but he goes a bit far here. Recently he hosted both Pat Buchanan and a liberal woman discussing foreign policy. Pat Buchanan was so strong and affective, Chris Mathews had to present a liberal counterweight to what Buchanan was say, making it two against one just to make the debate seem fair. </p>
<p>I always hated the show &#8216;Politically incorrect with Bill Maher&rsquo;. The host himself was so patently straight-line PC, at least 90% of the time, it was pretty obscene they called the show &#8216;politically incorrect&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Chris Mathews is demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide because it would make the DEAR LEADER in the White House very happy. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are under no obligation to do this.</p>

		<p>I think given the right circumstances and the right people behind her, Sarah Palin could start a populus movement in this country.  I think the attacks against her are atrocious and disgusting.  Do I think she is ready to be President - I don&rsquo;t really know at this point?  I met her when she was campaigning last year and she was as you see her on TV, very gracious and down to earth.  Is it an act - I WILL NOT make those assumptions.</p>
<p>However, now that we have a &#8220;black&#8221; president in the White House (an ill-equipped and inexperienced President to boot) blacks and liberal morons like Chris Matthews are going to want to make sure that only blacks occupy the White House from now on.  If Obama should succeed in winning a second term, in 2016, it will be expected the White House should always have a black occupant in the Oval Office.  </p>
<p>One need only look at every other aspect in this country.  Affirmative action has made it possible for the uneducated, ill-equipped mentally and educational wise to secure some if not 90% of all government jobs, both locally, state and federal.  Been to the DMV and any major city courthouse lately.  Affirmative action has allowed the slow minded, jungle minded of the population to secure some of the most lucrative jobs in the country with no threat of firing even for poor performance.  Political correctness has allowed some of the most virulent and hate-filled blacks to fill positions in this country - Nidal Hasan comes to mind.  The murderer of 13 innocent men and women at Ft. Hood.  </p>
<p>Obama may have attended Harvard but his past lack of experience and actions since he took office in January say only one thing to me -  this is affirmative action at it&rsquo;s best.</p>

<p>The attacks on Sarah Palin are atrocious and disgusting..however the only kind of populist movement that Sarah Palin could ignite is the fake conservative populist movement of Fox-News. The biggest threat faced by Native Born White Americans is the invade the world-invite the world world view of the fake conservatism&hellip;.the Republican party</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Sarah Palin would invade the world..in areas of the planet that are known to be nuclear war triggers. She is an Evangelical Christian extremist who believes in the insane Rapture Theology. Evangelical Christian extremists are hard core war mongerers. They should never be trusted with several hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p>On immigration, she is an immigration enthusiast. With Sarah Palin, the race-relacement of the Native Born White majority would continue apace.</p>
<p>So my question for you Gayle..why would you want to vote for Sarah Palin if the election of Sarah Palin means the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans?</p>
<p>Let the Republican party go to its awaiting grave. Nothing will be possible unless the Republican party is completetly destroyed.</p>
<p>Everyone here should stop thinking in terms of a top down political solution to the halting of the race replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>One last thing, an immigration moratorium-Peter Brimelow-means a moratorium on the race replacement of Native Born White Americans for a few years..to be continued a few years later. The only solution is a permanent and complete shut down of post 1965-nonwhite LEGAL IMMIGRATION&hellip; until the sun burns up its nuclear fuel and implodes into either a black hole or a neutron star..a very long time into the future.</p>

		<p>People appreciate Sarah Palin for what she is.  She is not pretentious and does not speak (or look) down on others.  She has struck a chord with those who are not part of the washington georgetown cocktail party circuit.  Don&rsquo;t forget that most &#8220;media types&#8221; have sold their &#8220;journalistic souls&#8221; to get invited to these events.  <br>
She scares the hell out of both democrats and republicans.  She may be the spark that is needed to start a true alternative to both the democrat and republican parties.  Don&rsquo;t forget, that in the 1800s the Whig party was replaced by the Republicanparty.<br>
If we are to take back the country, this &#8220;change&#8221; may be what is needed.</p>

<p>I think that she could indeed be used to co-opt such a movement.  She seems far too manipulable to me.  If the GOP runs her as their candidate it&rsquo;s only because they&rsquo;re afraid that they&rsquo;ve pissed off enough white people as to be otherwise electorally unviable.  But if they do support her, she will dance to their tune - the same old Bush/McCain neocon globalism.  I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p>
<p>The GOP needs to go extinct.  Mrs. Palin is, I&rsquo;m sure, a nice lady.  She should go back to Wasilla and raise her kids, or join the PTA, or run for mayor again.  But she should not be President, and she will not get my vote.</p>

<p>If I were something like a state Governor or President, you would be one of my speech writers.  Some of the things you say here are so cogent and fluent, and said in such a minimum number of words, that you make a great propagandist (in the good sense of the word propaganda.)</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m going to have to disagree with your contention of rapture/millenialist theology as &#8220;extreme&#8221; in the American context.  It is very much the mainstream of American Christian thinking among medium- to low-Protestants (i.e. not High Protestants).  I happen to agree with you that it&rsquo;s not correct at least Biblically so, and that people way up on high are happy that so many white Christians have been neutralized by this end times/rapture nonsense.  And it&rsquo;s uniquely American because of John Nelson Darby, whom I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of.</p>
<p>However, I once stepped in a big pile of cow mess several years ago.  I made the flippant and arrogant remark, it was something along the lines of &#8220;Good Catholics and Lutherans, the kind of people who have to do more than open up a Cracker Jack box to get a theology degree, don&rsquo;t believe in this rapture (swear word censored).  They believe Revelation as a symbolic interpretation of past events, not a literal prophecy of future events.  Why is it that only the snake handing morons believe this (swear world censored)?  Those kind of people who think that were nothing more than horse waste shovelers in Martin Luther&rsquo;s time.  Had ML known that his Reformation led to horse dung shovelers getting to interpret the Bible and be taken seriously, he would ran back to the Pope and begged for forgiveness/clemency.  ML was a theological elitist, who was pushed and prodded into the Reformation by a thirsty populace in the Northern Germanies;   All ML wanted was to reform Catholicism.&#8221;</p>
<p>That went over like a lead balloon.  There were at least eight highly educated ministers, all rapture believers, who heard me, and I had to be gently reminded that many medium to low Protestant ministers, who believe Rev. as future and literal, are just as well educated as those &#8220;good Catholics and Lutherans&#8221; my Teutonically arrogant self loves so much.  Their faith is as good as mine, is as good as theirs.  It&rsquo;s faith, you can&rsquo;t prove it.  My Christianity is no more or less true than your atheism/agnosticism/Odinism/whatever, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>And if you bash and trash it, you&rsquo;re going to make needless enemies.  Some of whom are white racialists in the South who are mostly Baptist.</p>
<p>Also, I cringe at the William Pierceian rhetoric of you and 20 S.L. Cain.  If the Republican Party goes to waste, why should you, or Cain, or I, or anyone, be so arrogant to presume that a BNP-like party will rise from the ashes like the Phoenix?  It&rsquo;s just as likely that the party that replaces the Republicans will be even more left wing, or it could be possible that no party will replace the Republicans and we&rsquo;ll have a one party oligarchy.  People like Pierce wanted everything to go to s-word, except he forgot that in the American experience, government and society turn sharply leftward and egalitarian in chaotic times.</p>
<p>But I think both of you are right about Sarah Palin.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen so far, I&rsquo;m not overly impressed.  Even before the election, we found out that she signed off on a Mexican consulate office in Anchorage.  The irony of that, as Peter Brimelow pointed out, is that Alaska is one of the last few places where white people with strong backs and not much in the way of gray matter can make a very good living, ONLY because of its distance from Mexico.  Levi Johnson is able to support his child because he and the Palins don&rsquo;t live in San Diego, so that Johnson can have a good job with high wages.  And his mother in law seems to want to turn Alaska into San Diego.</p>

<p>Also, I cringe at the William Pierceian rhetoric of you and 20 S.L. Cain.&#8221;</p>
<p>I take umbrage at the comparison to Pierce, an anti-American, neo-Nazi, Odinist crank.  I do not want things to go to hell, although I believe they are well on their way there despite all that.</p>
<p>You must realize that the Republican party has never really been a conservative party, except perhaps for the years from about 1910-1950.  It is certainly not one now.  Just this evening, while channel-surfing, I happened across Mary Matalin, CNN&rsquo;s favorite Republican party operative.  That foul harpie was talking about some kind of new 10-point purity policy for RNC approved candidates - 10 things they will have to sign-on to, in order to recieve party backing.  I&rsquo;m sure that at least three of them will be really bad (amnesty, endless wars in the middle-east, free-trade).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.  But I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is not to continue to trade our votes for the GOP&rsquo;s lies.</p>

		<p>Sarah Palin won&rsquo;t be the Republican nominee in 2012, I think. She still carries too much political baggage, is seen as a &#8220;dim bulb&#8221; intellectually, and would be fodder for the SNL and late-night talk show crowd once more. Can the Republicans really afford to have her as their standard-bearer in 2012? I think not.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s three years away, but, I believe the 2012 elections will be about who best can protect, preserve and defend our Constitutional freedoms. The economy will be another issue, but the chipping away of our freedoms will be the central one.</p>
<p>A lot will depend on the war situation in Afghanistan and Iraq. Will we still be in Afghanistan? Perhaps. Maybe, we&rsquo;ll be at war with Iran, even as our war in Iraq is over. If we do go to war with Iran, it will be &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s Vietnam&rsquo;. Maybe a conflict with another country, like North Korea.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the unknown. Obama may not even be in the White House by 2012. What if he was to die of a heart attack or stroke? What if he was removed from office by Congress after having been found to be ineligible, by virtue of being born in Kenya? I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be assassinated - I hope not, for the sake of our country - since we&rsquo;ve already seen what Bantus on a national rampage are capable of (1968 King assassination riots).</p>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t see Palin as the 2012 Republican nominee, here are two names I think could be in it - Bob McDonnell the governor of Virginia, and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Both are strong supporters of the Second Amendment and in favor of veterans&rsquo; rights. Burr especially has been vocal in opposing the Obama regime&rsquo;s smear tactics against American veterans by saying they could be potential terrorists.</p>
<p>Just my two cents fellow Amrenners, but let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving to all of you!    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curios why White Americans would support Palin in the first place.  She hasn&rsquo;t espoused any ideas or done anything to capture the hearts of conservatives everywhere.  She&rsquo;s politically inexperienced and her TV interviews made her sound like an airhead.  She, like Obama, is nothing more than a media creation to manipulate the minds of the sheeple, only the liberal media is helping this time by portraying her as one of us.  The Bucchaninites, the Ron Paulers, the John Birchers, the White Nationalists, etc. have gained quite a bit of leverage in right-wing politics since the election.  It is those people who will or should play a leading role in selecting our next Presidential candidate.  Sarah Palin will get nothing more than a passing guffaw from us.</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words. What I have been doing here on American Renassaince is trying to teach people who post here the most effective and efficient way to &#8220;debate&#8221; the race-replacement issue. I put quotes around  debate because there is no debate.  In any public &#8220;debate&#8221; that Jared Taylor participates in, he should completetly frame this issue in terms of race-replacement:there is no justification for the race-relplacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS at the hands of post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims and africans. Once this &#8220;debate is framed this way, throw in the ecology and economic issues, because hen these issues becomes questions about &#8220;why should Native Born White Americans&#8221; be in favor&hellip;fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS have been voting for three decades against their race-replacment. When running away is no longer an option the you know what is going to hit the fan.</p>
<p>It is absolutely crucial at this point to take a laser beam focus on the race-relacement program of the Republican party,</p>

<p>You mentioned something interesting, about how there really isn&rsquo;t a debate.</p>
<p>I like it when Jared Taylor goes up against various reconquista on the brain Aztlan nuts, because he always wins, and always wipes the floor with them when it comes to facts, logic, reason and evidence.</p>
<p>But will it mean anything in the long run?  Demography is destiny.  Hispanic Aztlan kooks might not have much in the way of gray matter, but they and an increasing percentage of the population in the American Southwest (and many other places) is Chicano Hispanic.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter to them that Jared Taylor can run circles around La Raza/MECHA/MALDEF/LULAC types, because both they and the latter are Hispanic.</p>
<p>Let me put it to you another way:  When our grandchildren are being driven out of the American Southwest, feet don&rsquo;t fail me now, and when our great-grandchildren are either on a boat back to Europe or in a Hispanic-run gas chamber awaiting their death, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll all agree that they&rsquo;re glad that Jared Taylor won all those debates way back in their grandparents and great-grandparents&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>Even if there isn&rsquo;t any actual secession, will it matter?  East St. Louis, Illinois, is still part of the United States, but only in the sense that many of its residents receive welfare from its Federal or state governments, and some do time in its Federal or state prisons.  But do you, as a white person, want to live there?  That&rsquo;s the probable future of the American Southwest   &mdash;   one big Hispanic barrio, still technically attached to the United States, but wholly unlivable for whites.</p>
<p>Which makes the point you drive home all the more important.</p>

		<p>I do think Palin&rsquo;s popularity is indeed partly due to a backlash against Obama&rsquo;s, well, alienness. She is a breathtakingly uninspiring candidate, but she&rsquo;s the right&rsquo;s answer to the political correctness of Obama. Unfortunately, not nearly enough. The right-wing just doesn&rsquo;t get it; in the political correctness game, a black man will trump a white female every time. The right made their fatal mistake when they agreed to play the political correctness game in the first place, a game they can never win.</p>

<p>Explain to me why there IS justification for the &#8216;race-replacement&rsquo; of the Anglo-Norman stock who CREATED America and is being replaced by post-1900 non-Anglos of every hue and ethnicity? The Anglo-Norman establishment made the same arguments you&rsquo;re making now back in the early 1900&rsquo;s with respect to people that you now welcome eagerly as &#8216;fellow white brothers&rsquo;. </p>
<p>What makes you think that your argument is superior to theirs? </p>
<p>Why is it okay for Anglo-Normans to be replaced by Southern/Eastern Europeans, but not okay for the pan-European group to be replaced by Third Worlders?</p>

<p>The Anglo-Normans did get things rolling in the US, but it was the WASPs I hate to say that sold all whites out. Their vanity was &#8220;played to&#8221; by Marxists who fleeced them, seeing how they could use the snobbery that had developed amongst the upper crust Wasps as a wedge to make them separate from other whites, to lose sight of the country as a whole.  In other words, these people have been brainwashed by our Marxist rulers into looking down on &#8220;other whites&#8221; to destabilize society. The Marxists were quite snaky in cultivating a heightened attitude of snobbery among these people in order to keep the divide and conquer routine going smoothly. They appealed to the vanity of the upper crust Wasps, most of whom are not as smart as they think they are when it comes to being cunning or being able to stand back and look at things at different angles. These arrogant whites merely take things at face value, swallowing whatever definitions the Marxists feed them in school and on the boob tube, framing things in order to make these people feel as if they are intellectual, when in fact they are merely parroting the thoughts of others. Complete rubes. This why we have people here and on other sites trying to pit whites of different ethnicities against each other. They are so foolish as to not notice, or they are self-deceptive in not noticing that our enemies themselves frame whites as one big group. A group of enemies to non-whites. A group deserving of hate from non-whites and their enablers. All this while the wanna-be intellectuals enjoy a scratch on the head from their masters, proud of &#8220;their&#8221; logic in telling us what&rsquo;s wrong with whites. How whites aren&rsquo;t a racial group. How there is no group consciousness among whites. If they felt all of this to be true, that it was no worry, no threat, they wouldn&rsquo;t be here shoveling the road apples all over this site. They are so repetitive and predictable it&rsquo;s almost funny. Almost. </p>

		<p>For Jupiter and others.</p>
<p>There can&rsquo;t be a &#8220;debate&#8221; without common rules. Attempting to debate leftists is always futile because leftists are without any interest in, or committment to, truth, facts, fairness, or even the required rational spine of argument itself.</p>
<p>This is mainly because their &#8220;arguments&#8221; are always false pretenses. They have no interest in a better way to do things, or preserving what is good of what currently exists. </p>
<p>Their sole objective is power, and every one of their proposed policies are only one more trojan horse painted up to deceive, and leverage aside any perceived social value or structure that is an obstacle to them. Their one and always goal is to steal maximum power over free individuals.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t debate a committed thief, you stop him.</p>
