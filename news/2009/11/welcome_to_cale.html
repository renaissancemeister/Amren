<h1>Welcome to Caledonia, Where Flying the Flag Is Asking for a Fight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christie Blatchford, Globe and Mail (Toronto), November 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Natives who routinely and sometimes violently broke the law but nonetheless played the victim; police who wouldn&rsquo;t police, but dispensed private cellphone numbers and calming hugs instead; and a small town where flying the Mohawk Warrior flag was deemed perfectly fine, but doing the same thing with the Canadian flag was held to be provocative: Welcome to Caledonia, Ont., circa 2006.</p>
<p>The true story of the alchemy which began to occur in that small southwestern Ontario town that spring is unfolding here in the courtroom of Ontario Superior Court Judge Thomas Bielby.</p>
<p>A Caledonia family  &mdash;  Dave Brown, Dana Chatwell and their teenage son Dax  &mdash;  are suing the Ontario government and the OPP for a total of $7-million for effectively abandoning them to the lawlessness surrounding a native occupation of a former development site called Douglas Creek Estates.</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s home is bordered on two sides by the site, part of a simmering Six Nations land claim.</p>
<p>It was first seized in February of that year by natives from the nearby reserve. It remains occupied by them to this day, effectively if informally ceded to them by the province which later that summer bought out the developer for $12-million purely, it appears, to allow the occupiers to stay unmolested.</p>
<p>It may have been just a slip of the tongue the other day when David Feliciant, the government&rsquo;s lawyer, referred to the site as &#8220;the DCE Reserve,&#8221; but the land, in all but name, has become just that.</p>
<p>The world of Mr. Brown and Ms. Chatwell, and to a lesser degree that of other Caledonia residents whose homes were also close to the site, was Kafkaesque, a bewildering place where black was white, right was wrong, up was down.</p>
<p>By the fall of that year, audiotapes of some of Mr. Brown&rsquo;s many calls to the OPP reveal a startlingly agreeable man  &mdash;  he invariably called the female police dispatchers &#8220;hon,&#8221; began all conversations with a cheery &#8220;Hi, how ya doing?&#8221; and thanked them before hanging up  &mdash;  but with a rising fear and sometimes outright panic in his voice.</p>
<p>Some nights, he phoned back repeatedly, begging for help, sometimes asking for officers to be sent to his home, other times too afraid to be seen with them. &#8220;I really don&rsquo;t want to be walking out there,&#8221; he said once.</p>
<p>But the OPP, it was clear, would not enter the occupied land, would not make arrests as they would in the usual course, and had actually &#8220;negotiated&#8221; with the natives that the lone cruiser which was posted by the DCE entrance was not allowed to respond to calls from residents like Mr. Brown, and that only a &#8220;roving&#8221; squad car could do that.</p>
<p>The roving squad car, of course, roved only around the edges of DCE, never entering it, either in pursuit of suspects or to make arrests.</p>
<p>Once or twice, the tapes showed, when Mr. Brown would call back asking where the police were, the dispatcher would explain that the call had been routed through London, and that if he wanted better service he should always ask for the &#8220;Caledonia Resettlement Unit&#8221; of the OPP.</p>
<p>One night, when he asked that the OPP station a car near his house, he implored the dispatcher, &#8220;Just don&rsquo;t ignore my calls okay? It&rsquo;s unsafe here, if you ask me. They&rsquo;re shining spotlights all over, all around the perimeter.&#8221; Police notes duly stated that &#8220;Occupiers are in multiple vehicles, shining lights everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>When an officer showed up, as requested, Mr. Brown phoned back and asked the dispatcher to have the officer call him: &#8220;I just want to say thank you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And as it was then, so it remains, as an exchange between Mr. Feliciant and Mr. Brown yesterday illustrates.</p>
<p>The lawyer was playing a piece of the family&rsquo;s homemade videotape, now an exhibit, from some time that summer. Mr. Brown and Ms. Chatwell were outside, discussing whether they should call the OPP; there were natives, in a couple of trucks, again shining spotlights into their home. It was to capture that act that Mr. Brown got out his camera in the first place, to prove it had happened.</p>
<p>Suddenly on the tape, a native woman could be heard shouting: &#8220;Stop harassing us! Put your camera away! You&rsquo;re violating our rights!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah okay,&#8221; Mr. Brown said, but he muttered, &#8220;Unbelievable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; Mr. Feliciant asked yesterday. &#8220;You can hear someone from the site yelling at you to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard that,&#8221; Mr. Brown said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You continued to film?&#8221; Mr. Feliciant asked. Mr. Brown agreed that he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you have put your camera down?&#8221; Mr. Feliciant asked. &#8220;Clearly, you&rsquo;ve agitated them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Mr. Brown asked, disbelieving even after all this time. &#8220;I&rsquo;m looking at that spotlight that is staring at you on the screen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My house is being lit up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Feliciant is using OPP call records, incident reports and notes, two years worth of the family&rsquo;s MasterCard records and Ms. Chatwell&rsquo;s diary in his cross-examination of Mr. Brown. Several times yesterday, in his scrutinizing of the family&rsquo;s spending, the lawyer pointed out liquor purchases.</p>
<p>Mr. Feliciant appeared to be trying to demonstrate that contrary to Mr. Brown&rsquo;s evidence, the OPP did respond to him. Indeed they did, but from the notes and tapes yesterday, that response was usually to try to &#8220;calm down&#8221; Mr. Brown or his wife.</p>
<p>As Christmas of 2006 approached, with Mohawk Warrior flags all over the DCE and on Mr. Brown&rsquo;s street, Caledonia residents had had enough, and decided they would carry or hang a Canadian flag. Mr. Brown decided to fly one in his front yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&rsquo;t you at all concerned about instigating a confrontation with protesters?&#8221; Mr. Feliciant asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;By hanging a Canadian flag?&#8221; Mr. Brown asked, furious.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Canadian flag was not allowed to be flown,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a very, very proud Canadian. I&rsquo;m proud of my country. This was my opportunity and my right to believe we still live in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The OPP was not concerned with the Mohawk flags all around my property and on all the telephone poles. They were agitating me. You didn&rsquo;t concern yourself with that,&#8221; he told Mr. Feliciant. &#8220;You didn&rsquo;t care that they were agitating me at that time, [did] you?</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&rsquo;re telling me that I&rsquo;m provoking someone by hanging a Canadian flag?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brown&rsquo;s flag was stolen a few days later, and, he told the lawyer, he stood with his uncle, three police cruisers in his driveway, as the &#8220;OPP let them [the natives] stand there with my Canadian flag.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Recently a guy I know was attacked by two blacks in North Las Vegas and the police officers told him that North Las Vegas is a no-go zone. While it&rsquo;s not a good idea for Whites to go to North Las Vegas it is not a &#8220;no-go&#8221; zone . The cops asked him if he needed an ambulance and then drove off. They made no attempt to find the perpetrators. </p>
<p>Then just a couple of days ago 3 blacks entered the garage of a off duty Las Vegas cop and shot him to death. Within hours the police had found the 3 killers. Cops are just regular guys doing an important job. Most of them could care less about the public. They are simply collecting a pay check. When one of their own is attacked they will work. When you or I am attacked they usually could care less. Cops and the politicians are not your friends.</p>

		<p>This story should serve as a reminder that whites in North America need to be worried about not only non-white persons moving in from third-world countries, but also those persons who were here before our white ancestors - Indians (aboriginals yes, but I would never call them &#8216;First Nations&rsquo;!). They are just as demanding, non-productive, and full of hate and disdain towards whites as any non-white third-world person you would ever meet.</p>

		<p>Howard:</p>
<p>The rationale I have heard for cops pursuing cop killers as fast as they can in comparison to an average person being murdered is that a person who would murder an armed and trained and uniformed cop would have even less hesitance to kill a regular person, so that&rsquo;s what makes them so dangerous that they have to be apprehended now.</p>
<p>(Except the LV cop shooting you cited involved an off duty cop, not in uniform, and presumably not armed.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe this theory.  Why are we to believe that a cop killing thug would automatically do this to an average person?  An average person isn&rsquo;t trying to arrest such a thug, so the thug wouldn&rsquo;t shoot the average person.</p>

		<p>The OPP (<b>Ontario Provincial Police</b>) has been more than useless in upholding the law in this multi-year battle over native land rights in Caledonia, Ontario. </p>
<p>A more serious &#8220;flag&#8221; incident happened a couple of years ago when a well-known protester was actually arrested for trying to place the Canadian maple leaf flag on a telephone pole alongside unhindered native flags.</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of taxpayers dollars have been spent only to appease and placate our homegrown terrorists, while legitimate complaints from white citizens were simply ignored or downplayed&hellip;. so as not to offend these &#8220;terrorists&#8221;. </p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Re your cop-killer theory, I always thought it is because police officers consider themselves as a kind of co-ed fraternity, of &#8220;brother and sister&#8221; officers.</p>
<p>Me personally, I have always considered a police officer&rsquo;s job to be a political job, one who protects the state. There&rsquo;s no difference if a police officer is killed, or a schoolgirl, a stevedore, or a long-haul trucker - dead is dead. I&rsquo;ve always resented the fact that police advise us civilians not to try to defend ourselves, or our families; but, instead to &#8220;leave it to law enforcement&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense. Every person has the right to protect him/herself, with lethal force, if the situation calls for it. If SCOTUS rules to incorporate the Second Amendment against the states and cities in the case, McDonald v. Chicago, police departments are going to find out we civilians will need them less than ever before, to protect ourselves and families.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.  </p>

		<p>I wonder what would happen if people raised red flags all over America. Bit by bit&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;As early as the 15th century, the red flag was used as a&#8221; flag of Defiance. &#8220;It was raised in cities and castles under siege to indicate that they would not surrender.&#8221; The red flag is a signal of Defiance and battle; &#8220;According to Chambers Cyclopedia (1727-41).&#8221;</p>

		<p>A white man films a group of Indians trespassing on his property and the gov&rsquo;t lawyer bashes him for &#8220;agitating&#8221; the protected minority?</p>
<p>Then the same lawyer claims the white man provoked the Indians by daring to hang a Canadian flag on his property?!? </p>
<p>He then goes through the man&rsquo;s credit card records looking for dirt and find that the white man (gasp) once bought alcohol! He brings up this damning information several times at this Kafkaesque trial.</p>
<p>Kudos to the gutsy reporter Christie Blatchford. Hopefully the p.c. brigades don&rsquo;t end her career.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been personally disillusioned by how little police do when its near an indian reserve and how slow they are to respond (eg. forty five minutes to come three blocks), but the police aren&rsquo;t backed up by the courts, ( one example, last year a belligerent indian was peppersprayed for threatening police when a group of them were drunken, loud, rowdy and crazed after a soccer game, so it was made out to be a possible big offense by the police to defend themselves, big powwow). Police get the feeling its futile but they do handle a lot of indian crime just because there&rsquo;s so much of it. We should give them credit for that much.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity - A few months ago, a young female police officer was attacked and badly beaten not far from where I live (in Sydney Australia). She was returning from maternity leave and her husband is a high ranking police officer. She was in a coma for several days but made a good recovery. The police went all out to catch the attacker, there were dozens of them patrolling the surrounding streets and interviewing people who live in the area. The story was splashed across every newspaper for several days. Maximum police power was used to catch the attacker - an Aboriginal. Everyone was glad that he was caught, but many people stated the obvious - how quickly and efficiently the police work when it&rsquo;s one of their own. If it had been an ordinary citizen - like my daughter who lives 5 minutes from where the attack took place - I wonder if they would have been quite so gung ho. Seems to be widespread cynicism regarding police dedication to protecting the public..</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will ever be peace and acceptance among the races. You simply cannot throw people of different cultures together and expect them to live in harmony. It&rsquo;s impossible. These differences are ignited and burst into flame when the cultures clash. Diversity has never worked and won&rsquo;t in our lifetime. Maybe never.</p>

		<p>Several people have referred to the futility of relying on the police for protection. What hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned is that (as far as I know) the courts have ruled that it&rsquo;s not the police&rsquo;s job to protect the public.  They are there to catch criminals.  Have I got that wrong?</p>

		<p>Mr.Brown should not rely on the police to solve his problems, he should solve them himself.  If they won&rsquo;t stop shining lights on his house, he should shoot them out. </p>
<p>He might get a bit of jailtime for it, but I doubt the &#8220;Indians&#8221; would mess with him after that.  If there is one thing self-righteous &#8220;I deserve everything the white man has without having to work for it like he did&#8221; ethnic minorities in white countries understand, it is the fact that harassing white people who&rsquo;ve made it clear they won&rsquo;t put up with their nonsense is bad for their personal health.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the time I drove past an apartment complex in the ghetto and saw at least twenty black men playing basketball outside, and not ten feet away there was a huge nazi flag hanging outside one of the first floor apartment&rsquo;s windows, I saw a white guy inside as well incase anyone was thinking it was just another case of minority hijinx.  At the time I remember thinking - my god, that man must be either crazy or heavily armed.  Probably both.  I&rsquo;m not excusing nazism, just making a point - show you mean business and you&rsquo;ll be given a wide, wide berth.</p>

		<p>Howard - post 1 - You are quite correct. Cops are not friends to us. Indeed, I think they are more likely to be deadly foes when it comes to picking sides. Why do you think the police have all become &#8220;militarized?&#8221; There is little difference now between the typical SWAT team and a squad of battle ready marines. Think also of the vast network of prisons that have been built in the past 20 years. Allegedly done to fight drugs and crime, this infrastructure can easily be directed against an uprising citizenry. Include the vast databases that exist on each and every one of us. They can come snatch us up any time they want. Many cops are unfortunately little more than minions of the established order, an established order that has degenerated into a coterie of self serving people who would sell of their own kind and their own culture to further their corrupt interests. It will not likely once again come to offer its grim fruit to cheering crowds. But the cheering crowds may come to be nonetheless, but silently waiting for the reckoning they thirst for. They will silently wait until the realization that they ARE the reckoning washes over them and that salvation lies in their own hands. It will then be a time for everyone to pick a side. Cops included.</p>

<p>I think the explanation is simpler than what you said (even though what you said is just about entirely correct).  Cops and soldiers are nothing more than employees, the only difference between they and the average person is that cops work for a local, county or state government and soldiers work for the Federal government.  Like any employee, they&rsquo;ll do what they&rsquo;re told.  If they&rsquo;re told to unload a machine gun in your skull, they&rsquo;ll do it without hesitation.  Furthermore, they&rsquo;d do it even if they called you buddy and friend when you sat next to them in a bar the evening before.  I know someone who was involved in the Boston deseg street battles in the 1970s, and even though the white Boston cops almost to a man and woman were against deseg, (many joining the Citizens Councils and voting George Wallace in 1976) when the Chief and Mayor said clear the anti-deseg protesters out of the way, they did just that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably better that way, even though I don&rsquo;t want my skull riddled with the bullets of automatic gunfire.  If cops and soldiers did whatever they wanted, then they couldn&rsquo;t be controlled, either controlled for better or worse.</p>

		<p>Regarding how vigilant police are when one of their own is killed, they need to be. They are at higher risk because they have to deal with dangerous criminals all the time; they need to be more vigilant when protecting their &#8220;own&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just like taxi drivers; in some states it is a capitol crime to kill a taxi driver (just like killing a cop) not because the drivers are &#8220;more important&#8221; but because they are more at risk. It seems fair to me.</p>

<p>Every single one of those parents told their children to avoid contact with police as much as possible. As Question Diversity says, they will call you buddy this week, and be screaming &#8220;raus! raus!&#8221; as they herd you into the trucks the next.</p>

		<p>The OPP here is just plain scared. They do not want a violent confrontation where they might be killed. These Indians are very capable of going on the warpath and killing some OPP or any other white that gives them a single dirty look. And I mean warpath not in a figurative way but literally. </p>
<p>There really is terrible fear in this Caledonia. The whites there have just been intimidated and have good reason to be fearful. The cops are NOT going to help and have abandoned any law and order principles to coddle the &#8220;natives&#8221;!!</p>
<p>These Indian hot-heads really are dangerous and punishment meted out to them for any wrong-doing will be minor, so the cops say: &#8220;why risk it??&#8221;</p>
