			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Rennell, Daily Mail (London), November 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sarah Robinson was just a teenager when World War II broke out.</p>
<p>She endured the Blitz, watching for fires during Luftwaffe air raids armed with a bucket of sand.</p>
<p>Often she would walk ten miles home from work in the blackout, with bombs falling around her.</p>
<p>As soon as she turned 18, she joined the Royal Navy to do her bit for the war effort.</p>
<p>Hers was a small part in a huge, history-making enterprise, and her contribution epitomises her generation&rsquo;s sense of service and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Nearly 400,000 Britons died. Millions more were scarred by the experience, physically and mentally.</p>
<p>But was it worth it? Her answer  &mdash;  and the answer of many of her contemporaries, now in their 80s and 90s  &mdash;  is a resounding No.</p>
<p>They despise what has become of the Britain they once fought to save. It&rsquo;s not our country any more, they say, in sorrow and anger.</p>
<p>Sarah harks back to the days when &#8216;people kept the laws and were polite and courteous. We didn&rsquo;t have much money, but we were contented and happy.</p>
<p>&#8216;People whistled and sang. There was still the United Kingdom, our country, which we had fought for, our freedom, democracy. But where is it now?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The feelings of Sarah and others from this most selfless generation about the modern world have been recorded by a Tyneside writer, 33-year-old Nicholas Pringle.</p>
<p>Curious about his grandmother&rsquo;s generation and what they did in the war, he decided three years ago to send letters to local newspapers across the country asking for those who lived through the war to write to him with their experiences.</p>
<p>He rounded off his request with this question: &#8216;Are you happy with how your country has turned out? What do you think your fallen comrades would have made of life in 21st-century Britain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>What is extraordinary about the 150 replies he received, which he has now published as a book, is their vehement insistence that those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war would now be turning in their graves.</p>
<p>There is the occasional bright spot  &mdash;  one veteran describes Britain as &#8216;still the best country in the world&rsquo;  &mdash;  but the overall tone is one of profound disillusionment.</p>
<p>&#8216;I sing no song for the once-proud country that spawned me,&rsquo; wrote a sailor who fought the Japanese in the Far East, &#8216;and I wonder why I ever tried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;My patriotism has gone out of the window,&rsquo; said another ex-serviceman.</p>
<p>In the Mail this week, Gordon Brown wrote about &#8216;our debt of dignity to the war generation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But the truth that emerges from these letters is that the survivors of that war generation have nothing but contempt for his government.</p>
<p>They feel, in a word that leaps out time and time again, &#8216;betrayed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>New Labour, said one ex-commando who took part in the disastrous Dieppe raid in which 4,000 men were lost, was &#8216;more of a shambles than some of the actions I was in during the war, and that&rsquo;s saying something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;Those comrades of mine who never made it back would be appalled if they could see the world as it is today.</p>
<p>&#8216;They would wonder what happened to the Brave New World they fought so damned hard for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor can David Cameron take any comfort from the elderly.</p>
<p>His &#8216;hug a hoodie&rsquo; advice was scorned by a generation of brave men and women now too scared, they say, to leave their homes at night.</p>
<p>Immigration tops the list of complaints.</p>
<p>&#8216;People come here, get everything they ask, for free, laughing at our expense,&rsquo; was a typical observation.</p>
<p>&#8216;We old people struggle on pensions, not knowing how to make ends meet. If I had my time again, would we fight as before? Need you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many writers are bewildered and overwhelmed by a multicultural Britain that, they say bitterly, they were never consulted about nor feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her words may be offensive to many  &mdash;  and rightly so  &mdash;  but Sarah Robinson defiantly states: &#8216;We are affronted by the appearance of Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But then political correctness is another thing they take strong issue with, along with politicians generally  &mdash;  &#8216;liars, incompetents and self-aggrandising charlatans&rsquo; (with the revealing exception of Enoch Powell).</p>
<p>The loss of British sovereignty to the European Union caused almost as much distress. &#8216;Nearly all veterans want Britain to leave the EU,&rsquo; wrote one.</p>
<p>Frank, a merchant navy sailor, thought of those who gave their lives &#8216;for King and country&rsquo;, only for Britain to become &#8216;an offshore island of a Europe where France and Germany hold sway. Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a group, they feel furious at not being able to speak their minds.</p>
<p>They see the lack of debate and the damning of dissenters as racists or Little Englanders as deeply upsetting affronts to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our British culture is draining away at an ever increasing pace,&rsquo; wrote an ex-Durham Light Infantryman, &#8216;and we are almost forbidden to make any comment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A widow from Solihull blamed the Thatcher years &#8216;when we started to lose all our industry and profit became the only aim in life&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Her husband, a veteran of Dunkirk and Burma, died a disappointed man, believing that his seven years in the Army were wasted.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is 18 years since I lost him and as I look around parts of Birmingham today you would never know you were in England,&rsquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>&#8216;He would have hated it. He also disliked the immoral way things are going. I don&rsquo;t think people are really happy now, for all the modern, easy-living conveniences.</p>
<p>&#8216;I disagree with same-sex marriages, schoolgirl mothers, rubbish TV programmes, so-called celebrities and, most of all, unlimited immigration.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am very unhappy about the way this country is being transformed. I go nowhere after dark. I don&rsquo;t even answer my doorbell then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Desert Rat who battled his way through El Alamein, Sicily, Italy and Greece was in despair.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is not the country I fought for. Political correctness, lack of discipline, compensation madness, uncontrolled immigration  &mdash;  the &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; have a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>&#8216;If you see youngsters doing something they shouldn&rsquo;t and you say anything, you just get a mouthful of foul language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, some of the complaints are &#8216;grumpy old man&rsquo; gripes, as the veterans themselves recognise  &mdash;  from chewing gum on pavements and motorists using mobile phones to the march of computerisation (&#8216;why can&rsquo;t I just go to the station and buy a railway ticket?&rsquo;) and the dearth of pop music tunes you can hum.</p>
<p>But it is the fundamental change in society&rsquo;s values which they find hardest to come to terms with.</p>
<p>Bring back birching and hanging, the sanctions they grew up with, they say. Put more bobbies back on the beat.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were rigidly taught good manners and respect for older people,&rsquo; said a wartime WAAF, &#8216;but the nanny state has ruined all that. Television programmes are full of violence and obscene language.</p>
<p>This Land of Hope and Glory is in reality a land of yobs, drug addicts, drunkard youths and teenage mothers who think they are owed all for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aged 85, she has little wish to go on living.</p>
<p>For others, the strength of character that got them through the war is still helping them to survive the disappointments of peacetime.</p>
<p>A crofter&rsquo;s son from Scotland who served on the Arctic convoys taking supplies to Russia found the immediate post-war years hard.</p>
<p>&#8216;In those days we had no welfare support from any source. It was as though we had served our country to the full and were then forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8216;However, we were very resilient and determined to make a go of it, and many of us, including myself, succeeded.</p>
<p>&#8216;How times have changed now, with the countless many clamouring to get welfare benefits for the asking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A medic who made it through Dunkirk and D-Day thought the fallen would be appalled by the lack of manners in modern life and the worship of celebrities, plus &#8216;the patent dishonesty of politicians&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another common issue was their bemusement at the idea anyone could live in constant debt.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were brought up to believe that if you hadn&rsquo;t the money, you waited till you had!&rsquo; one wrote.</p>
<p>However, this particular man was unusual among the 150 respondents in believing that there were many pluses to modern life.</p>
<p>He even had a good word to say about the European Union and felt it would appeal to the fallen &#8216;if only for maintaining the peace in Europe over the past 60 years or so&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He praised the breaking down of class barriers in Britain compared with the years when he was young and &#8216;infinitely&rsquo; increased prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8216;More clothes, cars, holidays abroad, home ownership. As a young teacher in the Fifties I had one suit (Army issue) and the luxury of a sports jacket and flannels at the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8216;Education has made vast progress. In my early days I taught classes of 50. Only five per cent of children went on to further education compared with over 40 per cent today.</p>
<p>&#8216;The emancipation of women has also been a huge plus, with the introduction of the Pill a large contributor. Before the war, women teachers were dismissed as soon as they married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Land Girl who laboured on farms in Devon during the war agreed that &#8216;we have so much to be grateful for.</p>
<p>&#8216;So much progress has been made to transform the standard of living since the war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she could not help asking whether people were any happier.</p>
<p>She bemoaned the advent of the Pill and the collapse of sexual morality. &#8216;In my day, drugs were unknown, families remained together, divorce was a rarity and children felt secure.</p>
<p>&#8216;Were our sacrifices made so hooligans may run wild? And aggressive behaviour be accepted as the norm by TV interviewers and society in general?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A captain with a Military Cross for valour under fire thought Britain was still the best country in the world.</p>
<p>The &#8216;occasional&rsquo; sight of parents and nicely dressed children gave an otherwise gloomy veteran of the Italian campaign a sense that &#8216;what we did all those years ago was not for nothing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A grandmother, the widow of a Royal Marine who took part in the D-Day landings, felt the National Health Service had descended into chaos but was grateful for a pensioner&rsquo;s free television licence, &#8216;which brings art, travel and animals into my home&rsquo;, and being able to text her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Just being alive was a bonus. &#8216;Although I hate what is happening to our country, I am so happy to be here, grumbling, but remembering better, happier days,&rsquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>But one of the bitterest complaints of the veterans was that their trenchant views on many of the matters aired here were constantly ignored by those in authority.</p>
<p>Their letters of complaint to councillors and MPs went unanswered.</p>
<p>It was as if they didn&rsquo;t matter, except when wheeled out for the rituals of Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>One person complained it is not right those lost in the World Wars are only remembered publicly on Remembrance Day</p>
<p>&#8216;Why do so many of the British public confuse sentimentality with genuine concern for others?&rsquo; asked one letter-writer.</p>
<p>But this was the generation honoured in Remembrance services last weekend, showered with gratitude and teary-eyed sentiments as their dwindling ranks marched unsteadily past the Cenotaph and other war memorials throughout the UK.</p>
<p>The overall impression any reader of the letters gets is that this generation feel unheard, unwanted and unimportant.</p>
<p>This remarkable collection of their thoughts should give us pause for reflection.</p>
<p>They may be deemed beyond their sell-by date (and many of their views may seem unacceptable, flouting every sort of &#8216;ism&rsquo; imaginable) but, by their deeds of 60-plus years ago, they have won the right to be listened to and their disillusionment noted with respect.</p>
<p>In one letter in this collection, an RAF mechanic quoted a poem about comrades who fell in battle: &#8216;I mourned them then, But now surviving in a world, Indifferent to their hopes and dreams, I grieve more for the living.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The man in my life is a pre-WW2 Brit who fought in the war.<br>
He still holds to the old values and attitudes (except for classism), and being with him  makes me feel like all is right with the world.   But, although he&rsquo;s a Labor man, he won&rsquo;t live in the Britain Labor created, and doesn&rsquo;t bother to vote in absentia because he cannot bear to vote Labor anymore.  He&rsquo;s an expat in Holland.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the Brits blame Europe for immigration when they should blame themselves for voting the same politicians for sixty years.</p>
<p>The truth is that UK was anti white for centuries, you fought with Turkey against Russia who tried for a long time to remove the Turks from Europe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any mosques in our countries and you have thousands and are turning again against Eastern Europe this time as a muslim republic.</p>
<p>People in Eastern Europe don&rsquo;t have any sympathy for you because you were our enemy throughout history.</p>
<p>You embraced Islam, now live with it, it is your choice.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the late Brit comedian Viv Stanshall (Bonzo Dog Band) who once quipped about his elder countrymen: &#8220;You fought in the last war to make people like yourselves impossible.&#8221;  But it&rsquo;s not just England.  My dad is 87 and a WW2 vet.  I pray he lives long enough to see American taken back by whites.  </p>

		<p>Great story.  Quite frankly I&rsquo;m amazed this was allowed to be printed in a major London newspaper. </p>
<p>The article references the D-Day landing.  I believe it was the 3rd British Infantry who stormed Sword Beach at Normandy.  It would have been interesting had a Time Machine been available on June 5th, 1944 to transport the British Marines forward to present-day London.  I&rsquo;m guessing after a glimpse into the future their landing craft would have done an immediate 180 degree turn.        </p>

		<p>Let this poor woman&rsquo;s commentary be a warning for us right here in the USA.  Must reading:  &#8220;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam&#8221; - should be required reading for every American.  And this video should be required viewing as well; better see it quick bkz they will probably zap it off the Internet soon.</p>

		<p>After more than 64 years the last wisps of smoke have finally cleared from the Second World War. Even as their eyesight fades, the last remaining &#8220;allies&#8221; begin to see things in perfect clarity. There was only one victor in WW2 and it was World Socialism. Redistribution of wealth,race mixing,multicultural societies,degenerate lifestyles,the elimination of private property,the destruction of Christianity,the list goes on and on. WW2 was a civil war against Nationalism. Victory for England meant the end of its empire. The Western World is being colonized by the Third World at the hands of global elitist. This is no coincidence or accident. Dumbed down,guilt ridden, and distracted,the White world is in flames once again and few even smell the smoke.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t these silly old Brits realize that diversity is our greatest strength?  Apparently the can&rsquo;t get beyond the urban violence, the muggings, the prosecutions of the innocent instead of the criminals, the contempt for tradition, education, civility, morality, and culture, preferring to focus on the minor negative aspects of multiculturalism instead of its overwhelming benefits, such as, umm, ahh, you know&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oh, never mind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sarah harks back to the days when &lsquo;people kept the laws and were polite and courteous. We didn&rsquo;t have much money, but we were contented and happy.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&lsquo;People whistled and sang. There was still the United Kingdom, our country, which we had fought for, our freedom, democracy. But where is it now?!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>During WW2, each and every American troop deploying to or through England was given a pamphlet describing the English life style and how to relate to the English people. All in the hope of teaching the American military man how to behave around the English, creating good will between the millions of American soldiers and the English people. Written in part by Margaret Mead.</p>
<p>That pamphlet was used in the 1980&rsquo;s to create a television COMEDY about modern English life. All the statements made in the pamphlet, such as: &#8220;The English people are the most law abiding people on the planet&#8221; was juxtaposed with TV screen shots of various yobs rioting and attacking the police. Yobs are vandals and hooligans, boys spelled backwards for those that have not noticed. Or: &#8220;the British sports fans are the most sportsmanlike of any population on the planet&#8221;. Again, juxtaposed with a TV screen shot of modern soccer hooligans [yobs] rioting.</p>
<p>[the Queen a number of years ago herself requested to see film footage of English soccer fans rioting. To see for herself. Her ministers advised against her watching such coverage but the Queen insisted, watched a short segment, and then walked away disgusted.]</p>
<p>England and America have changed since 1945, quite drastically so, and most would agree for the worst? From the material standpoint it has gotten better for people, but not with regard to civility or regard for law and order, etc.   </p>

		<p>I found this article most interesting as my uncle, a World War II veteran who served with the RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force) echos the sentiments of these British veterans. My uncle often says that he is disappointed and saddened by the way Canada has turned out. He views it as an Asian country, and certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have answered his conscription notice had he known then what he knows now.</p>
<p>Chinese and East Indian immigrants to Canada have no sense of Canadian history or culture. They have no pride in their communities or the country to which they immigrated.</p>

		<p>        Let&rsquo;s face it, the West made a mistake. Does anyone believe that any of this would have happened if the West had allied with Germany and crushed the Communists? Hitler warned the West what would happen and we didn&rsquo;t listen. And what they&rsquo;ve done so far is notning compared to what they&rsquo;re going to do. </p>

		<p>Call it Hitler&rsquo;s revenge (or the unjustly maligned Kaiser Wilhelm if you prefer). Either would be more at home walking around Berlin today then Churchill would be in London. The British foolishly and unnecessarily chose to fight two exhausting and ruinous wars with Germany. Wars the latter never wanted. Then they irrevocably lost the peace in 1948 when the treasonous Labour party opened the floodgates. Those Tommies in Montgomery&rsquo;s army and the pilots in the R.A.F. didn&rsquo;t know it but all they were really doing was fighting (and dying) to make the United Kingdom safe for non-White colonization and immigration. What hollow victories indeed. What is truly so sad is how many British servicemen voted Labour after the war. They had the idea in their heads that their fathers had won the last war (WW1, known as the Great War until 1939) but lost the peace. They wanted to avoid this. They thought that voting for Labour and its wacky Marxist-socialist nonsense was the answer. So sad. So stupid. </p>

<p>Want to know what really makes me mad?

My response is:  &#8220;You tell &#8216;em, Ms. Robinson!!!&#8221;  Most journalists cannot resist being PC these days.  At least they did print what the vets and their families had to say.  I wonder how our WWII vets feel now about having fought so valiantly to save Europe and the USA.</p>

		<p>Its the exact same deal here in Canada. In the 1940&rsquo;s the country was 99% White. Now we are overrun with blacks and Asians from the Third world, (thanks to Trudeau - who took a pass on serving in the war - and the treasonous Liberal party). You see these poor, tired old White men collecting money from the Poppy sales in the shopping malls in Toronto, Vancouver, etc, and all around them are black, brown and yellow people who they have absolutely nothing in common with. But they are the ONES getting their country and all the benefits of it for which they fought and suffered for. It must be so sad for these old men. Knowing they sacrificed several of the prime years of their lives so the Liberal party of Canada could allow 250,000+ Pakistanis, Somalians, Jamaicans, Chinese and other riff-raff from the third world to come here every year. Many veterans I speak too are very disillusioned. Some tell me they would not have fought had they known the country would end up this way. </p>

		<p>The &#8216;mediaversity&rsquo; types collect the money (let alone control most of what we see and hear) so it&rsquo;s likely this book wont become a best seller, and sentiments like this will become mere ghosts if not completely unheard at all. Can you imagine something like this appearing in an American newspaper? yet America lost over 400,000 dead. Still, I think this is the best piece I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>

<p>Yes, I noticed that too.  And I don&rsquo;t like it either.   In virtually every journalistic piece touching on race or immigration, you will find the  standard, obligatory disclaimer such as: <i> &#8220;Don&rsquo;t get us wrong, we&rsquo;re certainly not racists or anything like THAT, but&hellip;&hellip;&#8221; </i> <br>
Or  else  there&rsquo;s the subtle, frowning implication that goes more or less:   <i>&#8220;Of course we think such views are terrible, and we don&rsquo;t agree with them at all, but solely in the interest of accurate journalism,  we&rsquo;ll report them anyway   &mdash;   deplorable as they are.&#8221;   </i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sneaking the comments through, all the while denouncing them and telling you what you&rsquo;re SUPPOSED to think.   The hypocrites!  These cringing, sniveling journalists are  disgusting!   Why can&rsquo;t they just tell the story without sermonizing?  We&rsquo;re adults and we don&rsquo;t need to be told what to think.  Furthermore, people who have lived 80 or 90 years and have seen a century go by (and helped shape it)  are entitled to their opinions and don&rsquo;t need to be chided by a supercillious young snot who&rsquo;s hardly a fraction of their age.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad to know that the sun has finally set on the British Empire. As a child during WW 11, I listened to the radio and heard the stories of the men and woman of Great Britian who were so brave duing the bombings. I recall the voice of Winston Churchhill telling the people to &#8220;never give up.&#8221; they didn&rsquo;t and they were victorious. They were part of the greatest generation- a generation never to be seen again.</p>

<p>I saw that video too and I  have to agree. There Obama was, right on tape, actually speaking of &#8220;My faith, Islam&#8221;, and praising it to the heavens, referring to passages of the Koran like he knows it well.  Amazing!</p>
<p>Regarding his lavish praise for Islam, it was inaccurate, distorted, and non-historical.  Of course, it&rsquo;s their version   &mdash;    that they &#8220;saved&#8221; us from barbarism, and they gave us everything we have today.   (Question: if they gave us all this wealth of culture and science, how come they don&rsquo;t have any of it?)</p>
<p>As for the music and art   &mdash;   both of them are  frowned on or forbidden by strict Islam. Bernard Lewis  goes into this in detail in his &#8220;What Went Wrong&#8221;,  pointing out that not only do they have no strong tradition in these arts    &mdash;   and little  interest or respect for them   &mdash;   but that they destroyed the rich cultures that preceded them.  Lewis points out that when great musicians, opera companies, and orchestras tour the world, there is one place that is not interested:   the  Islamic world.</p>

Friends, make no mistake - Islam IS the enemy, and will stop at NOTHING to take over us, our country, all of our assets, our kids, and force us to convert to Islam or die in the process.  </p>

		<p>Anyone who says that we in Britain (and especially England) voted for the lunacy of mass immigration/multiculturalism clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand the nature of our first-past-the-post electoral system, which delivers sizeable parliamentary majorities to parties with an actual minority of the popular vote (and takes no account whatsoever of the many who - disenfranchised by the interchangeability of the mainstream parties - register their protest by not voting at all).</p>
<p>Also, the policy of mass immigration was introduced stealthily, and consistently misrepresented by the political class and in the mainstream media (no Internet until the 1990s, remember) until it was too late to reverse things peacefully and by conventional political means. Those (like Enoch Powell) who did warn of its dangers were portrayed as hateful extremists and consigned, effectively, to political oblivion. (Powell, who could have led the Conservative Party, ended his Parliamentary career as an Ulster Unionist.)</p>

		<p>   I was born not too long after WW2, this could have been written about America . I blame LBJ mainly, with JC and the Clintons following close behind . Plus, there are no real conservatives anymore . Today&rsquo;s neo-cons talk out of both sides of their mouths, they are also to blame . I too, cringe when I think about Mosque and Hindu temples in an America I no longer know or understand . I was just thinking today back to the mid and late sixties . Before the intrusion of big government, big chains, the national economy and now the world economy . Nearly everyone worked for the local economy and did well . There were more jobs and people lived a more stable and secure existence than they do now under the auspices of big government and big corporations .You could buy a modest home and a modest vehicle, many of the best things in life were free . Today you can have a well paying job and you can buy all the useless junk you want but it is next to impossible to buy what really matters, like a home. Back then the smallest community always had a clubhouse . Dinners were held, fish fry&rsquo;s, etc . Today they are in ruins, there is no cohesion within communities now . We are all strangers . I was thinking, we need to go back to the local economy and local jurisdiction . Send big government packing and big corporations too if they cannot give up their political correctness and protected species hiring practices .    </p>

<p>The answer is simple.  She knows where her bread is buttered. If the Queen spoke out, the already shaky monarchy would be over tomorrow morning and she&rsquo;d be an ex-queen looking for new accommodations and employment.  She probably likes living in Buckingham Palace and prefers it to  a small flat somewhere in exile.   </p>
<p>At this point in history, the monarch is just the symbolic head of state, but she&rsquo;s no longer the one who holds real power.   Same as it is in the USA, by the way. The people out in front who appear to be in charge aren&rsquo;t the ones who are really in charge. Things aren&rsquo;t always as they seem.</p>

		<p>Mr.Obama in the video apparently doesn&rsquo;t realise that Islam first appeared circa 600 A.D.<br>
Therefore his assertion that Islam has given the western world mathematics, literature,<br>
music, etc. is way off the mark. The sciences and arts that he alludes to, were developed<br>
and created by the people in these areas prior to the imposition of Islam. The reason <br>
these people today are living in an arrested state of development is because their<br>
societies ceased to develop and progress as soon as Islam took control. Had it not been<br>
for the influence of  the western world they would still be living as they did in the <br>
6th century. </p>

Those Whites who do rally to the Standard of their liberator should be the new squires and yeomen, and the White multi-cultis the new serfs, bound to their master&rsquo;s land.  </p>
