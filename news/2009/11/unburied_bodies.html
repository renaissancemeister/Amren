			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Reid, Times of London, November 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The abandoned corpses, in white body bags with number tags tied to each toe, lie one above the other on steel racks inside a giant freezer in Detroit&rsquo;s central mortuary, like discarded shoes in the back of a wardrobe.</p>
<p>Some have lain here for years, but in recent months the number of unclaimed bodies has reached a record high. For in this city that once symbolised the American Dream many cannot even afford to bury their dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen this many unclaimed bodies in 13 years on the job,&#8221; said Albert Samuels, chief investigator at the mortuary. &#8220;It started happening when the economy went south last year. I have never seen this many people struggling to give people their last resting place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unburied bodies piling up in the city mortuary  &mdash;  it reached 70 earlier this year  &mdash;  is the latest and perhaps most appalling indignity to be heaped on the people of Detroit. The motor city that once boasted the highest median income and home ownership rate in the US is today in the midst of a long and agonising death spiral.</p>
<p>After years of gross mismanagement by the city&rsquo;s leaders and the big three car manufacturers of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, who continued to make vehicles that Americans no longer wanted to buy, Detroit today has an unemployment rate of 28 per cent, higher even than the worst years of the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The murder rate is soaring. The school system is in receivership. The city treasury is $300 million (Â£182m) short of the funds needed to provide the most basic services such as rubbish collection. In its postwar heyday, when Detroit helped the US to dominate the world&rsquo;s car market, it had 1.85 million people. Today, just over 900,000 remain. It was once America&rsquo;s fourth-largest city. Today, it ranks eleventh, and will continue to fall.</p>
<p>Thousands of houses are abandoned, roofs ripped off, windows smashed. Block after block of shopping districts lie boarded up. Former manufacturing plants, such as the giant Fisher body plant that made Buicks and Cadillacs, but which was abandoned in 1991, are rotting.</p>
<p>Even Detroit&rsquo;s NFL football team, the Lions, are one of the worst in the country. Last season they lost all 16 games. This year they have lost eight, and won just a single game.</p>
<p>Michigan&rsquo;s Central Station, designed by the same people who gave New York its Grand Central Station, was abandoned 20 years ago. One photographer who produced a series of images for Time magazine said that he often felt, as he moved around parts of Detroit, as though he was in a post-apocalyptic disaster.</p>
<p>Then in June, the $21,000 annual county budget to bury Detroit&rsquo;s unclaimed bodies ran out. Until then, if a family confirmed that they could not afford to lay a loved one to rest, Wayne County  &mdash;  in which Detroit sits  &mdash;  would, for $700, bury the body in a rough pine casket at a nearby cemetery, under a marker.</p>
<p>Darrell Vickers had to identify his aunt at the mortuary in September but he could not afford to bury her as he was unemployed. When his grandmother recently died, Mr Vickers&rsquo;s father paid for her cremation, but with a credit card at 21 per cent interest. He said at the time it was &#8220;devastating&#8221; to not be able to bury his aunt.</p>
<p>What has alarmed medical examiners at the mortuary is that most of the dead died of natural causes. It is evidence, they believe, of people who could not afford medical insurance and medicines and whose families can now not afford to bury them.</p>
<p>Yet in recent weeks there have been signs of hope for Mr Samuels that he can reduce the backlog of bodies. Local philanthropists have donated $8,000 to help to bury the dead. In the past month, Mr Samuels has been able to bury 11 people. The number of unburied is now down to 55.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that the White people who invented, built and keep the power plants running will continue to provide the electricity to Detroit&rsquo;s central mortuary, even after Detroit is no longer able to pay the electric bills.  </p>
<p>Thus far, the few remaining Whites, White businesses, and White taxpayers have been able to keep Detroit afloat.  However, there will come a tipping point, when there are simply too many Minority welfare cases, and too few productive Whites remaining.  Then that mortuary will really start to stink.  </p>
<p>Throughout the world, large numbers of Africans always produce the same result: decline in Civilization. </p>

		<p>Detroit should be renamed &#8220;New Port au Prince&#8221;. <br/>
Next the bodies can be left lying in the street like Calcutta. <br/>
Whe was the last time Detroit symbolized the American Dream? 1941? <br/>
If the bodies have been unclaimed for years why not just cremate them? Surely cheaper than a burial or leaving them on ice all this time. After cremation the ashes could get a &#8216;burial at sea&rsquo; in the Great Lakes.  </p>

		<p>Ya know, India came up with a solution to this problem hundreds of years ago.  Have public crematorium grounds.  That way anyone can get their family member&rsquo;s corpse disposed of in a hygienic way, it&rsquo;d relieve the burden on the city, and doubtless improve the smell in the morgue.</p>

		<p>What they never mention in any article that talks about Detoit&rsquo;s decline is how the demographics changed over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Detroit was a predominantly white city, now it is an overwhelmingly black city.  But that is never mentioned.  Instead all articles are written as though it is a great mystery as to why Detroit is such a mess.</p>

		<p><i>After years of gross mismanagement by the city&rsquo;s leaders and the big three car manufacturers of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, who continued to make vehicles that Americans no longer wanted to buy</i></p>
<p>It amazes me how the demise of manufacturing is always attributed to problems in the so-called &#8220;rust belt.&#8221; And yet many of the suburbs of these so-called &#8220;rust belt&#8221; cities are doing okay, or even thriving. </p>
<p>Why is this? Surely, one would expect the &#8220;rust belt&#8221; suburbs to be hit just as hard as the cities. By this logic, the whole country should look like the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Not so, because the suburbs simply turned to technology and health care and information management to replace the declining manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>Of course articles like this will never look at race, the real reason for the demise of cities like Detroit.</p>

		<p>Detroit was once the quintessential example of the modern industrial revolution.  It is now the quintessential example of the urban destruction brought about by black Africans when they reach critical mass anywhere, without a single exception, on earth.</p>
<p>They represent the greatest single threat to the survival of Western Civilization in our time, a threat to which we appear likely to succumb.</p>
<p>The torch will most likely be passed to east Asia, whose inhabitants, being for the most part racial realists, are unlikely to tolerate either their immigration or barbarism.</p>

<p>I agree completely. Note how the writer tries to blame Detroit&rsquo;s pathology and decay on those silly automakers not building the right cars! Completely ridiculous! No mention of Race. No mention of crime. No mention of the horrific black race riot in 1967 from which Detroit NEVER recovered. You see, it wasn&rsquo;t blacks, it was those silly carmakers and their poor decisions in the cars they chose to build. For this &#8220;journalist&#8221; denial is not just a river in Egypt. But what can you expect from Labour-controlled, politically correct Britain&hellip;. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m originally from the Detroit area myself, happily living in semi-rural Ohio.</p>
<p>My dad, who grew up in Detroit in the 1940s, said that one time Detroit was a nice place to live.  You could sleep in the park and know that you&rsquo;d wake up.  They used to show movies in a park.  My mother once lived on Vermont Street, and it was depressing to see the area on Google Earth  &mdash;  it looks like a war zone.</p>
<p>A lot of shenanigans are spilling into the suburbs.  I have a friend who lives in the suburb of Ferndale, a few blocks north of Eight Mile (the dividing line), and he had his car stolen out of my mother&rsquo;s driveway (it was recovered in Detroit).</p>
<p>My mother, who lives in Ferndale, said that things are getting bad there.  I&rsquo;ve asked her lots of times to sell her house and move here, out near the Amish.</p>
<p>Highland Park, a city bordered by Hamtramck on one side and surrounded by Detroit, used to be a high-class area, according to my dad.  Not so much anymore.</p>
<p>I remember during that Rodney King thing Dad was saying that if there were riots, they&rsquo;d better keep it on their side of Eight Mile.  Even so, he&rsquo;d sit out on the porch with Old Trusty  &mdash;  his .357 Magnum.</p>
<p>I kind of miss Detroit, though, and it&rsquo;s sad to see what used to be a beautiful city become a toilet.</p>

		<p>I was once told not to cross into Detroit after 5 pm by a kindly shop owner whose books I wanted to browse-he said,&#8221;it would be very dangerous for you especially if you got lost in certain ares-and they&rsquo;ll even jump you at red lights seeing you&rsquo;re an outsider&#8221;.I hardly could believe him but I heeded his warnings and thanked him for his cautions-I got my books via Fedex.Cry for the beloved nation to be reduce to this!</p>

<p>Not so, because the suburbs simply turned to technology and health care and information management to replace the declining manufacturing jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the tech jobs are going to India, and sooner or later the loss of manufacturing jobs will take a toll on health care.  People can&rsquo;t afford health care if they don&rsquo;t have jobs.  Obama can provide socialized medicine for awhile, but that won&rsquo;t be sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Obviously, whites can keep a place liveable longer than blacks without an economic base, but eventually the outsourcing WILL force the whole country into depression-like conditions.</p>
<p>All of those jobs that were supposed to replace the manufacturing jobs that we lost have not materialized and free traders are being forced to acknowledge that they were wrong.</p>
<p>Please understand that I am not suggesting that economic problems in any way justify black barbarism and destruction, but you are wrong if you think that even whites can sustain a First World standard of living while competing with Third World labor.</p>

<p>Uh, a ruined economy, untold violence and killings, fleeing Whites, a destroyed infrastructure.  If blacks had the numbers in Detroit, as they do in SA, you can be sure any White land would be confiscated, the Whites killed and the land handed over to the black elite.</p>
<p>I dredged up the pictorial &#8220;The Ruins of Detroit&#8221; for those who have not seen it. Want to take a look at what happens when blacks are in charge?</p>

<p>Here are Snowy Smith&rsquo;s pictures of Durban, SA, entitled &#8220;The Death of Durban&#8221;  &mdash;  see if you can spot the differences between the wreckage of Detroit and that of Durban:</p>

<p>No way.  No self-respecting White should keep Detroit running.  The blacks have destroyed what Whites built, run them off, taken over their beautiful homes, targeted them for destruction.  </p>
<p>Let the blacks in Detroit figure out how to keep the lights on!  Ask the beleaguered Whites in SA what happens when blacks take over the power plant (Eskom):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; traffic crawls to a standstill when the stoplights go out, and restaurants have to close since they can&rsquo;t cook. A company that makes plastic milk bottles claims it&rsquo;s losing 4 million Rand per week due to the power fluctuations. Complaints by CEOs of the economic damage have been belittled by the government, as Trevor Manuel, the Minister of Finance referred to loss estimates as &#8216;overcooked and utter garbage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Much of the problem has arisen from Eskom&rsquo;s rigid interpretation of South Africa&rsquo;s affirmative action program, black economic empowerment or BEE16&hellip;&#8221; </p>

I doubt if even the author really believes it is caused by &#8220;&hellip;the big three car manufacturers of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, who continued to make vehicles that Americans no longer wanted to buy.&#8221;  Most likely, the author needed to make that statement to get it past the editors. </p>

		<p><i>Obviously, whites can keep a place liveable longer than blacks without an economic base, but eventually the outsourcing WILL force the whole country into depression-like conditions.</i></p>
<p>There is some truth to this statement. Outsourcing, globalization and mass illegal immigration are combining to level first world and third world countries so that the USA is sliding towards second world status. It&rsquo;s not quite fair to blame blacks alone for the decline of cities like Detroit. The decisions of American elites have much to do with it, notably Sam Francis&rsquo; managerial-technocratic class. The black underclass is being played off against the white middle. And in this environment, we can expect racial tensions to increase as everyone scrambles for survival. </p>
<p>As for Detroit itself, I have had friends who lived their in the 1930s and 1940s, and they had some wonderful tales about what was once a symbol of American industry and vitality. Yet we have let this once great city decline to the point that one is reminded of Gibbon&rsquo;s ruminations on the ruins of Rome. </p>
<p>And Durban? I have not been there for quite some time, but I was in Salisbury (aka Harare) right after the forces of &#8220;majority rule&#8221; took over and already the city was on the decline. One wonders if future generations will look back on the ruins of these cities and wonder how we let it all happen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more likely to take I-275 and go through the western suburbs when visiting family now, than to take I-75 right through Detroit.</p>
<p>One time I was visiting my dad at Henry Ford Hospital, got turned around.  Found myself at 5 Mile (Fenkell) and Wyoming.  I told my dad that and his eyes got really wide and he said that was a really bad part of town.  I said, I could tell from the way things looked.</p>

		<p>When I was young, my father kind of groomed me for the integrated society.  He saw it coming.  He was good man too.  I&rsquo;ve had my experiences with the african.  At my age now, I have learned to segregate myself from them.  I expect very little from them and they don&rsquo;t disappoint.  What I do now is the work of my God by promoting abortions for the single welfare moms.  Yes, I consider that the work of the Lord.  The children have no father at home, the mother is almost a big zero, their environment is pathetic, and their IQs are very low.  But the one thing that I do my promoting their abortions is to stop a future african from raping, robbing, and looting our civilization.  No african no problem.</p>

<p>I agree.  I also think that this economic crisis will really end welfare as we know it.  Section 8, Medicaid and food stamps were conceived during a time when we could afford to support a few freeloaders, but we just can&rsquo;t afford it anymore.  Giving blacks welfare, I believe, is part of the outsourcing problem.  In China, the workforce knows that if they don&rsquo;t work, they don&rsquo;t eat.  So if you are going to build a factory, you are going to build it in a place where workers are motivated, not a place where workers&rsquo; basic needs are met whether they work or not.  </p>
<p>Basically, we&rsquo;re borrowing money from the Chinese to pay welfare to people who won&rsquo;t do work that Chinese will do.  Wages are the major factor in outsourcing, for sure, but I also think that industrialists should not have to compete with the federal government paying people to not hold a job.  Detroit is so beaten down, now.  Property values are now low enough that a black man could have the American dream on 10 dollars an hour.  That&rsquo;s still more than wages in China, but with the savings in transportation factored in, Detroit blacks should be competitive with Chinese, IF they are willing to work.</p>
<p>The part that really scares me is that if we cut off the welfare spigot, will there be riots?  A full-blown race war?  Will blacks just start stealing from us if they don&rsquo;t get their check?  If so, what then will we do?  Put them in prison?  That won&rsquo;t deter them, as I&rsquo;m sure a great many black men would probably prefer our First World prisons to life in a factory.  Then they&rsquo;ll wind up costing us even more money.  We are not constitutionally allowed to force them to work, and there&rsquo;s no chance of amending the constitution now with the direction the country has taken demographically.  </p>
<p>I too fear a coming disaster.  I fear for my family and also my friends, including those respectable blacks who work for a living and don&rsquo;t hurt anybody and whom I count as friends and esteemed colleagues.</p>
