			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Cockle, The Oregonian, November 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Aaron Luke is only 7, but his father, Marcus Luke, is already coaching him on whom to marry when he grows up: a Native American.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic advice from a man who married a white woman and still takes grief for it from relatives. But intermarriage has become so rampant, says Marcus Luke, that Natives are in danger of losing their culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a touchy issue. It&rsquo;s tough, really tough,&#8221; says Luke, 38, who lives near the Umatilla Indian Reservation just outside Pendleton with his wife, Rachel, and their son. &#8220;Too much assimilation is what it comes down to. My son is half Native American and half Caucasian. Which way does he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For both individuals and tribes, questions surrounding intermarriage strike at the heart of what it means to be a Native American. Just how much &#8220;blood quantum&#8221;  &mdash;  a term U.S. officials coined in the 19th century  &mdash;  does it take to be considered a Native American?</p>
<p>And where do tribes set the bar for enrollment? If they set it too high, they risk shutting out members and dwindling into oblivion; too low, and they spread resources too thin or render their identity meaningless. The proliferation of casinos has raised the financial stakes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We do need to let the people know, &#8216;If you continue on this way, there will be a sunset to our tribe, maybe in 70 or 80 years,&rsquo;&#8221; he [Brooklyn D. Baptiste, vice chairman of the tribal government at Idaho&rsquo;s Nez Perce Reservation] says. &#8220;What is the point of fighting for all these treaty rights if there is nobody left to exercise them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Estimates of intermarriage rates are imprecise. A 2000 book by Harvard professor Werner Sollors says more than half of married Native American adults in the U.S. in 1990 were married to a non-Native. The Encyclopedia of American History puts that number at about two-thirds in 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paradoxically, intermarriage has played a role in increasing the Native population. The U.S. census counted just 240,000 American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut in 1900, down from estimates of as many as 12 million or more in North America before Europeans arrived.</p>
<p>But last year, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the American Indian and Alaska Native population at more than 3 million (nearly 5 million counting those who identify themselves as Natives of mixed race), with 54,000 in Oregon. Those numbers are expected to grow.</p>
<p>Not everyone thinks intermarriage is a problem. Joseph Myers, executive director of the National Indian Justice Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., says Natives should focus on educating people about their heritage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issue is playing out in varied and unexpected ways. At the Nez Perce Reservation, members must be one-quarter Nez Perce to qualify for tribal enrollment. That&rsquo;s excluded about 200 young residents from the tribe&rsquo;s enrollment of about 3,400.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, a trend is under way to boost membership by lowering blood-quantum requirements, says Garrison of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Oklahoma&rsquo;s Cherokee Nation, for example, requires only that candidates prove descent from a Native American who lived there between 1896 and 1907, he says.</p>
<p>The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation accepts anyone with an enrolled parent or grandparent and who can prove they have one-quarter Native blood from any federally recognized tribe.</p>
<p>At the same time, a trend of &#8220;disenrolling&#8221; members is gaining momentum on other reservations. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rene Granados, 34, is also among those who saw tribal status slip away. Granados, a truancy officer on the Umatilla reservation and one-sixteenth Native American, qualified for enrollment in Oklahoma&rsquo;s Delaware Tribe as a child. But her mother procrastinated. By the time she tried to enroll her daughter in the 1990s, the tribe had changed its blood-quantum requirement to one-eighth.</p>
<p>Now Granados doesn&rsquo;t qualify for a share of Delaware tribal lands, dividends, education or other benefits that were birthrights of her grandfather.</p>

		<p>Being about 91% white and 9% Apache descent, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not 100% of either. I may be 6&rsquo; tall, blue eyes, pale skin, college educated white guy, but that small amount of Native blood promises me that I will never have a receding hairline.</p>
<p>As a white guy, I&rsquo;m proud of what my race has accomplished.<br>
As a descendant of the Apache, I breathe a sigh of relief that my drop on non white blood comes from a tribe that went down fighting instead of submitting to slavery. </p>
<p>Question: If intermarrying is so bad for Native Americans, then why do their most attractive and intelligent members look suspiciously caucasian - even by their standards?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been vocal about the dangers of intermarriage to native Americans for years.  Even though Amren represents the interests of white people, in reality the goals of race-conscious native Americans and whites are one in the same.  The same is true, of course, for Jews.  In times like these, we need all the allies we can get. </p>

		<p>Imagine that, an Indian married a White woman.  And now the Indians are wondering if his children should be accepted AS Indians.  Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but if a White person has such thoughts it&rsquo;s defined as racism - no questions asked.  Only when the evil White man wants to protect his race is it defined as ugly racism.  We&rsquo;re being genocided now.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how the 1990 census could list 240,000 natives living in the USA but in in the past year there were 3 million recorded natives living in the USA. There is no possible way the native population has increased by a factor of 12 in the last 20 years. The only thing I can imagine to explain this phenomenom is that more people are identifying with their native roots than before as it&rsquo;s becoming more popular to identify with native culture. </p>

		<p>And Whites were nearly a third of the world&rsquo;s people in 1900. Now, I have heard a figure of around 10%, and shrinking. So, why aren&rsquo;t more White people, outside of here on AmRen, concerned about White intermarriage with other races? Doesn&rsquo;t our race deserve to be preserved? We not only CONTRIBUTED much to civilization, but you may even go as far as to say, we CREATED civilization in the world today.</p>

Every race should be concerned about miscegenation. </p>
<p>Here in western NY, the natives are fighting for their sovereign rights and I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>What I always find strange is that most of their spokesmen look white.</p>

		<p>I estimate that I&rsquo;m about 3% Cherokee.  At most.  My mother looks it, my grandmother looked it, and I have a picture of my great-great-grandmother  &mdash;  she definitely looked Amerind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not all that thrilled with mixing races, either.  You get people from two cultures intermarrying, and there are problems.  It&rsquo;s best that people stay within their own race.</p>
<p>My ancestors since then have married white, and I&rsquo;ll encourage my son to stick with the white race.  My husband as far as I know is 100% Anglo.  I have an interesting mix of 47% Anglo, 3% Cherokee, and 50% Eastern European (Polish/Russian).</p>
<p>I have first cousins whose father is Puerto Rican, and they have the same percentage of Amerind (our mothers are sisters).  One of these cousins has two half-black children.  Talk about a mix!  So, breaking it down, my son has two second cousins that are 1.5% Cherokee, 23.5% Anglo, 25% Hispanic, and 50% black.</p>
