<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=114998">Anti-Anglo Racist Tripe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Elmore, WorldNetDaily, November 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} When you immerse yourself in racist hate literature, it creates a sensation akin to dipping your head in a bucket of garbage. It is cloying, smothering, fetid and unpleasant; you can&rsquo;t wait to remove yourself from it. All of this came flooding back to me when I happened across a copy of &#8220;America Libre&#8221; by Raul Ramos y Sanchez.</p>
<p>On his website, the author claims he wrote the book &#8220;as a wake-up call to the dangers of extremism  &mdash;  on both sides of this explosive issue. Illegal immigration is a hotly debated topic. Yet it is only the tip of the iceberg.&#8221; The first portion of this statement is a blatant lie. &#8220;America Libre&#8221; is nothing less than a Chicano nationalist &#8220;Turner Diaries,&#8221; a racist, hate-filled screed that gins up anti-Anglo resentment by painting a fantasy landscape in which all Hispanics are rounded up and put in camps. Ramos&rsquo; heroes revolt, hoping to create a U.N.-recognized &#8220;Hispanic Republic of North America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Specifically, his book is concerned primarily with depicting, transparently, all non-Hispanics as racist, ignorant, incompetent fools driven only by hatred and given only to brutality. There are no complex characters; there are only Hispanics to varying degrees of purity {snip} and Anglos exhibiting varying degrees of racism. To the extent that military veteran and bodybuilder Mano at first loves America, then becomes only too eager to commit cold-blooded murder in seeking revenge for the injustices perpetrated against Hispanics, his character could be considered dynamic. He is, however, only a convenient water boy carrying the author&rsquo;s racist hate.</p>
<p>The Anglos against whom Mano pits himself with only token reluctance are, almost to a man, racist monsters who spit words like &#8220;Beaner,&#8221; &#8220;Greaser&#8221; and &#8220;Pancho&#8221; with every breath. When they&rsquo;re not attempting to rape Hispanic women or killing Mano&rsquo;s children with their incompetence {snip}, they&rsquo;re nervously firing into crowds of understandably angry protesters because they&rsquo;re nothing but ill-trained glory hounds suffering delusions of action-hero greatness.</p>
<p>Two things disturb me about &#8220;America Libre.&#8221; The first is that this book won an International Latino Book Award when it is clearly only a mediocre novel in terms of its writing. (It was also one of USA Today&rsquo;s picks for &#8220;Summer Reads&#8221; and was similarly lauded in Latina magazine.) The second is that Ramos&rsquo; depiction of evil, Hispanic-hating Anglos, only too eager to deny Social Security benefits to illegal aliens (when they&rsquo;re not cruelly deporting them outright), is obviously what he truly thinks of non-Hispanics. &#8220;America Libre&#8221; exists for one reason only: to foment hatred and revolutionary sentiment among a Hispanic population that has already become volatile in the southwest United States.</p>
<p>This is most evident in that Ramos absolves from blame another of his protagonists, a wealthy instigator who pays gang members to stir up trouble to help along the inevitable revolution. (These gang members shoot down police officers.) By the novel&rsquo;s end, protagonist Mano no longer considers himself an American. He is committed to the revolution and vows to go on fighting.</p>
<p>This is a thoroughly evil book. I do not understand how the Hachette Book Group justifies mass-producing this racist tripe. This is not literature; this is a La Raza fantasy of the &#8220;reconquista&#8221;  &mdash;  a Chicano nationalist movement that seeks to retake portions of the United States in the name of Hispanic racial and social justice. {snip}</p>

		<p>A weak, feeble response from a civic nationalist who bleats about &#8220;hate&#8221;, not understanding that that&rsquo;s what differing ethnic groups do when they reach a large enough portion of the population. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Elmore thinks this book is a greater evil than the immigration policies that allowed all these Hispanics into the country in the first place. </p>

		<p>So, Hispanics come to this country, degrade it with graffiti, garbage and murder, and then claim anyone who might object to more immigration - threatens to make things really bad for folks on the way to winning an award for this &#8216;observation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I do agree with one thing. It&rsquo;s not so far-fetched as to be a fantasy-landscape. Switch the races of the protagonists and it&rsquo;s not such an inaccurate picture.</p>

<p>American citizens should not have to give social security benefits to illegal aliens and have every right to deport them. Neither Mexico or any other Latin American country gives benefits to foreigners in the country illegally and they don&rsquo;t hesitate to deport them. What is &#8220;evil&#8221; are Mexicans who think they are above another nation&rsquo;s laws and have the right to illegally invade at will!!!!</p>

		<p>Have Hispanics originated anything of current use? According to this author, they even lifted the spine of the &#8216;Turner Diaries&rsquo;. Not very original thinking at all.</p>
<p>How can you be a &#8216;Chicano Nationalist&rsquo; when there is no such thing as a Chicano Nation?</p>

		<p>I have, over time, come to have doubts about the wisdom of educating Hispanics.  For the most part, my non-White students have been descendants of pre-1965 Mexican immigrants, who speak less Spanish than I do.  I have done my best to teach them well, and they know it and generally appreciate it.  But when it comes to immigration and the Mexican culture their grand and great-grand parents fled, most of them are reflexively in favor of La Raza.  This country gives more to these people than their Motherland ever would, but not many are grateful.  There are those who are good, loyal Americans, but they&rsquo;re a pretty small minority, I&rsquo;d say.  </p>

<p>But to think that book won an award! It&rsquo;s like if &#8220;The Turner Diaries&#8221; or &#8220;Hunter&#8221; were rewarded with a prestigious prize like the Goncourt prize&hellip;</p>
<p>But to tell you the truth&hellip; I kind of like the idea of violent latino gang members being interned in camps!</p>

		<p>The fact that the author uses the racist term Anglo instead of white,  and that he felt compelled to include that extraneous bit in the middle about the Turner Diaries shows that he has internalized the white-hating racism of the liberal establishment,  as have most conservatives.   An interesting thing about Ramos is that he is a Cuban, not a Mexican.   His revanchism is purely racist.  Cubans are the Republicans favorite Hispanics but once communism goes in Cuba they will revert to form leaving the ever credulous Republicans standing with their jaws in their traditional slack position.   It&rsquo;s important to remember in the face of all the whining from Hispanics that they came here for only one reason - because we are here.   Not because of the air quality, or natural resources, or the sparkling water but because white people made this a relative paradise compared to the dumps they came from.   No other people would have tolerated such an invasion,  certainly not the Mexicans.   Still they have the nerve to complain.   It brings to mind a quote from Mark Twain,  particularly appropriate for Cubans like Ramos:  &#8220;If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure by what logic someone would assume I do not also decry the immigration policies that have swamped us in a large population of non-English-speaking aliens who are responsible for a tremendous amount of crime in our country.  A longer version of this article, which includes material on this subject, is found here:</p>

<p>For that matter, I&rsquo;m not sure how one would conclude I am a &#8220;civic nationalist.&#8221;  But then, I suppose bringing this book to national attention is nothing but a &#8220;weak, feeble response&#8221; to Hispanic racism.</p>

		<p>Seems like Earl Turner gets a tan. I wonder if this Mexican racialist just read Turner Diaries and decided to put his own race in the driver&rsquo;s seat? Not surprisingly, the non-white version of The Turner Diaries is greeted with awards while The Turner Diaries is banned everywhere.</p>
<p>By the way, why doesn&rsquo;t The Turner Diaries ever get mentioned during Banned Book Week?</p>
<p>Probably because the librarians like that it is banned!</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re seeing a massive white flight and even a black flight out of California, I believe as Central and South Americans come to be a super majority in the american southwest that irredentism will increase as time goes on. Many African-Americans are moving to the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; and many Whites are moving to places like the Pacific Northwest and back East.</p>
<p>I would venture to guess around 2030-2040 the South West will essentially be like any other country south of the Rio Grande is today, with colonias in every city and Spanish the only spoken language. </p>
<p>Just the other day I was reading Civil War 2 by Thomas Chittum, this book was written in 1995 and in only 14 years, many of his predictions have come true. Mexicans born in the U.S. have been granted Dual citizenship and Mexican legislators represent Mexicans in the U.S. now. If things continue in the present direction, it&rsquo;s going to be June, 1991 all over again but only this time it will be right here in North America.</p>

		<p>Mr. Elmore, if you are not a civic nationalist, then I apologize. It&rsquo;s just that I used to be a civic nationalist who fretted about culture and assimilation, and believing it was possible to Americanize this very large number of Hispanics living in this country. Now I have come to realize that will never happen as the Hispanics reach a large enough percentage of the population. It has also made me realize that ethnic groups operate on the interest of ethnic groups, and they will not assimilate into the a culture that is defined as being created in a vacuum - being in a civic nationalist society we are supposed to be believe that culture has nothing to do with the people who built that culture. That anyone and any number of their kin and friends can walk into our country and POOF - they are Americans. I&rsquo;ve realized how flawed that mindset is, which is why I admire the Hispanics&rsquo; sense of ethnic loyalty and family. It is also why I don&rsquo;t find this book a threat, but rather a godsend, for it rips the veil of assimilation, that the media likes to claim exists, right off the coming Hispanic Juggernaut. To me, this book cuts through the lies and propaganda of the pro-immigration civic nationalists, and shows to us whites how the rest of the world views nationalism not through the context of culture but through ethnicity. And sooner we figure that out, the better. </p>
<p>Being that I am no longer a right wing civic nationalist, I don&rsquo;t frequent World Net Daily anymore, and when I saw your article on World Net Daily, I made assumptions on your ideology based on that and the fact that you were primarily criticizing the racism of the Chicano nationalists, which is something I used to fear as a civic nationalist but not anymore. Thus I put 2 and 2 together and judging by your disdain towards the term civic nationalist, which is an ideology most conservatives adhere to, it sounds like it added to 5.</p>
<p>Once again, I apologize. </p>

		<p><i>There are no complex characters; there are only Hispanics to varying degrees of purity {snip} and Anglos exhibiting varying degrees of racism.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much characteristic of Chicano &#8220;literature.&#8221;  A few years ago, VA&rsquo;s health department wanted to warn Hispanics about the dangers of STDs, but regular pamphlets were too complicated and complex.  So they studied modern Indoamerican culture, and used a &#8220;fotonovela,&#8221; that is, a picture book with very simple prose and a simple plot line.  </p>
<p>Not all whites are Anglos, though it&rsquo;s a convenient Chicano slur word for whites.</p>
<p>Hispanic Republic in North America?  Mexico once held what is now the American Southwest.  It was sparsely populated when the U.S. took it as a war spoil.  Now they want it back because white people made something of it.  Once the Chicanos reclaim it, it will revert to pretty much what it was in 1850.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not better than whites at making babies. They have a lot of kids because whites are forced to pay for it through confiscatory taxes. Taxes dreamed up by the elites to transfer wealth to the elites and their tools. In this case, low IQ latinos who left to their own devices can create little more than villages filled with adobe huts and garbage. </p>

<p>Will the situation with all those violent latinos who live in the U.S. illegally and categorically refuse to learn English, degenerate into a civil war in states like Califonia?</p>
<p>Maybe I am crazy but I wonder if that could be a good thing! Why? Because then, Whites would send their armed forces to deal with the problem, directly and openly. And no affirmative action queen like Sonia Sotomayor, nor any anti-American organisation such as La Raza, could be of any help to rebelling Chicanos gangsters, being struck by machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Whites would be able to defend themselves, instead of being spat on, and called racist at the first sign of retaliation.</p>
