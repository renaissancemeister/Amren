			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, November 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Brazilian census board says that the non-whites in Brazil will outnumber the white population this year.</p>
<p>This means there are more people of African descent in Brazil than in any country outside of Africa itself, making Brazil second only to Nigeria in terms of its black population.</p>
<p>But only about 6% of African-Brazilians consider themselves to be fully-black  &mdash;  the overwhelming majority classify themselves as mixed-race.</p>
<p>Many Brazilian universities have adopted affirmative action policies or quotas to try to boost the number of black and mixed-race students in higher education.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Gary Duffy says this move has divided opinion in the country and provoked lengthy legal and political battles.<br>

-&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Brazilians are clueless. They know what&rsquo;s what, and they would not be doing this on their own. Brazilian whites are realistic and have never had any death wish nor self-hate. Nor do they have any romantic fantasies about uplifting other races, during poverty, or doing good for the world.  No Brazilian celebrities go to Africa to adopt orphans, which they would see as a ridiculous publicity ploy.</p>
<p>This development is coming from pressure (both cultural and political) emanating from North America and Europe.   Can it also be linked to the political upheaval that the Obama administration represents to the rest of the world? I have to wonder. I think the Brazilians have just seen the handwriting on the wall and are accommodating to it. If they know they must.</p>

		<p>Madison Grant, Uruguay is actually more white than Chile and is also one of the most prosperous countries in South America.  Costa Rica is another prosperous Latin American country (see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_rankings_of_Costa_Rica).  It is 80% white - so it&rsquo;s actually more white than the United States!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for people doing what they can to get a decent education. If Blacks and Mulattos (many who have a phenotype indistinguishable from Blacks here in the U.S)  can get educated, employed, and improve their society it would be beneficial to all Brazilian citizens. It is a shame that they have to go through the trials of enforcing Afirm/Act when it really should not be necessary. </p>
<p>@Anonymous 7:05&hellip;&hellip;Brazil was one of the world&rsquo;s biggest race mixers. Many years ago the Portuguese actually encouraged intermarriage to breed out Blacks and Indians. Now I know it may have started out as a necessity in the 1600s for White men (due to scarcity of White ladies) to breed with female slaves and servants. But this type of thinking carried on well into the 1950s, and I am not sure why.  If I could quote a Black woman I hope it can spread a little light on why Brazil is choosing to adopt played out Afirm/Act policies now&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wish people were more honest about the idea of privilege in and of itself. Color and ethnicity is simply how it&rsquo;s played out. In a world where people are competing for perceived scarce resources, one wants all the privilege they can get, and thereby supports any overt connection to privilege, on the chance that one will get a share of those resources. If you and your &#8220;group&#8221; don&rsquo;t have those privileges and access to resources, then what? &#8221; I think it leads to a situation where you may have Black people downplaying or disregarding obvious Black ancestry  and some Whites trying to overplay or invent Black ancestry because both feel they could get some benefit.</p>

<p>I do acknowledge that Brazilians love to have fun. To them, life is a party. Everything is pleasure. At least when they can get enough to eat first!  </p>
<p>They are without any Puritan, Protestant tradition - which makes them quite unlike guilty North Americans.</p>

<p>Here are some SA nations w/their alleged % of white citizens followed by their GDP:</p>
<p>Chile   95%  $14,900<br>
Argentina  97%  $14,200<br>

		<p>Brazil was settled by the Potuguese who certainly are darker than the English who settled the US. I went to school in a town with a large Portuguese decended (not Brazilian) population and almost every one had dark hair and eyes. I recently spent some time in Rhode Island which has the biggest Potuguese community in the US and was able to get a channel aired from Portugual on my TV. Some of the people looked like they were mestizos. Although the modern white population of Brazil is mostly a mix of Portuguese, Spanish, German and Italian. So maybe to many Brazilians a mulatto is almost the same as being white, so there&rsquo;s less opposition to miscegenation.</p>

		<p>What is all this future tense talk about how &#8220;this will be America&#8221; in however many years? This IS America already. The youth of this country are brown and black as whites are too busy having recreational sex to have procreational sex. Southern Brazil is an economic powerhouse. The whites of Brazil have created some of the worlds most successful companies, for example Petrobras and Embraer. Who&rsquo;s heard of a third world country that manufactures aircraft? Of course it won&rsquo;t last for the same reasons it won&rsquo;t last in America and didn&rsquo;t last in South Africa. They already have the (second) worst crime rates in the world. We&rsquo;ll see how well they can cope with the 2016 Olympics. </p>

<p>A lot of people casually called  &#8220;Portuguese&#8221; are not really so, ethnically.   It depends on where they are from, if not from the mainland.   Many of those you saw  in New England are from the Cape Verde Islands, off the African coast, and they are indeed mulattos (not mestizos).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Azores in the mid-Atlantic were settled in the Middle Ages by tall, fair Flemish people from Flanders (what is now in Belgum/Holland).  This was due to the intricacies of royal marriages at the time. Portuguese royalty was very closely connected to Flanders and England. The English alliance protected Portuguese independence from Spain. The great Portuguese promoter of exploration   &mdash;   the one who started the Age of Exploration, Prince Henry the Navigator   &mdash;    had an English mother, Philippa of Lancaster,  a woman known for her intellect and learning. She was the daughter of John of Gaunt [Ghent], an English prince who was born in Flanders.</p>

		<p>What benefit does Brazil GET from having such a huge black population? Probably very little. It would be interesting to see how different Brazil would be if it had a Japanese population as large as it&rsquo;s black one and only a small black population.</p>
