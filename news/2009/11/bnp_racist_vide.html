<h1>BNP Racist Video: &#8216;Spot the White Man&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordan, NowPublic (Canada), November 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A racist video has appeared on AlanSugar1&rsquo;s Youtube channel called &#8220;Spot the White Man&#8221;, which claims that &#8220;indigenous white people&#8221; were displaced by non-white immigrants, and that this could happen to your neighborhood!!!!!! If you watch the video, you&rsquo;ll immediately notice that the walk along this Peckham Rye high street shows a totally normal street scene, with normal people doing normal things, like chatting, shopping, waiting for the bus. But, because these people aren&rsquo;t white, this is somehow a bad thing. My anger over this video isn&rsquo;t based in political correctness, but in distaste for a clearly b******t argument. This video is blatantly racist, and appeals to the closet xenophobes out there, most likely those who are unaware that 1/4 of English people have French blood.</p>
<p>I used to live in South London, in a predominantly black and South Asian neighborhood. The only difference I noticed was that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. actually, there was no difference compared to the &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhoods in London that I lived in. Being in Zone 3, things were far less expensive, which obviously makes it favorable to immigrants, of which I was one. I was just as much a stranger to England as someone from Somalia or Kenya, but I seriously doubt that the proponents of this video would have as much of a problem with me.</p>
<p>The modern world was built on immigration, and no mistake. &#8220;Indigenous white people of Peckham&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  oh, please.</p>
<p>(Oh, and that&rsquo;s obviously not the Youtube channel of the real Alan Sugar, former owner of Tottenham Hotspur)</p>

<p>The modern world was built by white people, who discovered the laws of mechanics, the laws of electricity and magnetism, the laws of chemistry, quantum mechanics, most of molecular biology, most mathematics beyond elementary algebra, and most of the technology based upon these sciences.</p>
<p>And yes, the indigenous people of Peckham are indeed white.</p>

<p>Ah, the Brit version of the American, &#8220;We are a nation of immigrants&#8221; fraud! Nice try idiot - but it is hardly a little French ancestry that the BNP, etc. are concerned with. Just as America&rsquo;s history of White, Western European immigrants has no parallel with an invasion of third-world cast-offs from every disparate corner of the globe.</p>
<p>Even in their endless complaining about all us evil &#8220;racists,&#8221; the enemy cannot be intellectually honest. </p>

		<p>I live in Canada, and downtown Toronto has become an alien city of Third World people, surreally overlayed on streets and buildings built in the last century entirely by whites. </p>
<p>Seeing a majority of people of foreign origin in white-built cities is unnatural and incongruous, alerting the eye to something gone awfully wrong in nature. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not as if there are anti-immigrant abuses that desperately need to be checked. Quite the opposite. &#8216;Positive action&rsquo; and political correctness are running rampant, as well as immigrant crime. Not to mention the all pervasive &#8216;white oppressor&rsquo; mentality. If it&rsquo;s wrong to stereotype, indeed to actively judge by race, why is it enlightenment to name whites and only whites as racist, oppressive, privileged etc. </p>
<p>This white guy is being remarkably short sighted. It truly looks as if it will only be when whites are so obviously facing extinction - only then will they begin to wake up, count for something, and have rights too. By then I would imagine it will be too late. I would imagine that&rsquo;s the nature of demographics and simple math.   </p>

		<p>I am of French extraction, and let me tel you something: We are as White as are the English. And the British are aware that the population of their country is made of people mixed Anglo-saxon, Scottish, Irish, French and Scandinavian blood!<br>
 <br>
Obviously, to anyone who has ever seen any of them, people like the Pakistani immigrants look nothing like people pf European extraction!</p>

		<p>What a pompous, deluded fool this writer is. &#8220;1/4th of English people have some French blood&#8221;. So what? The French are just across the Channel and have interacted with the people of the British isles for thousands of years. Probably 1/4th of Germans have some French blood too. Is having some French blood some kind of argument against opposing non-White immigration? I don&rsquo;t even understand the fool&rsquo;s point. In any case the video is &#8220;spot the White man&#8221;, not &#8220;spot the Englishman with a drop of French blood in him&#8221;. What an ass! &#8220;The modern world was built on immigration&#8221;. This is a bald-faced lie. Neither Britain or the rest of Europe (or many other places) were ever &#8220;immigrant-countries&#8221;. Is he saying that Britain was not a modern country in 1948 when the treasonous Labour party opened the floodgates of non-Whites? This is ridiculous. </p>

<p>If in fact the video shows a London neighborhood inhabited completely by non-whites, it is not making a &#8220;claim;&#8221; it is documenting a fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only difference I noticed was that &hellip; actually, there was no difference compared to the &ldquo;white&rdquo; neighborhoods in London that I lived in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not. Those crime statistics are a pack of lies.</p>

		<p>Maybe somebody can walk down the streets of Fargo, ND and post a video called &#8220;Spot the Black Man&#8221; (If some offended minorities want equal time). You notice that in the video, the electricity and telephones work; the train didn&rsquo;t derail and fall off the bridge; and the pavement of the streets seem to be in good order. The infrastructure hasn&rsquo;t been destroyed - yet, but this looks like it could come right out of some third world dump. In 20 to 30 years, that street will look no different than it would in Zimbabwe. Who keeps the infrastructure going, it certainly isn&rsquo;t the residents of the neighborhood who were on the video. </p>
<p>I recently saw a DVD called &#8220;World&rsquo;s Toughest Fixes&#8221; that was created by the National Geographic Channel. One involved replacing a TV (Broadcasting) antenna that was 1800 feet in the air in the middle of South Dakota. The entire crew was white, as were the electrical lineman replacing 60 year old line in NJ. The bulk of the people in this series were white. This guy can whine about people being racist, but who keeps the lights on and makes things work?</p>

		<p>I took the liberty of checking out the story at the source.  By and large, NowPublic seems to be a gathering forum for left-wing hand wringers and naval gazers.  However, they do allow comments, and by the looks of it the VAST majority of them for this story have been pro-White and intelligently posted.  I&rsquo;ll bet this self-hating White Jordan fellow wasn&rsquo;t expecting such a response!  I say more of us AmRen&rsquo;s should head on over, and deal these liberals a few more sucker punches!  Heck, we may even be able to pop their self-righteous bubble for a little while&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Anybody who has the means to do so is free to roam the streets of London and actually see for themselves.After all there&rsquo;s nothing to beat eyewitness testimony.<br>
 Just walk down the main thoroughfares of Wembley, Peckham, Southall, East Ham, Bethnal Green, Ilford, Harrow, Tooting, Elephant &amp; Castle, Brixton, Thornton Heath, Lewisham, Ealing, Hackney etc etc take in what you see as a purely objective disinterested observer.Just take in what you see - no prejudice, no axe to grind, just cold hard objectivity.<br>
 Now, an honest observer would get a distinct impression of the ethnic makeups of these neighborhoods.<br>
 Basically that is all these videos purport to do - purely eyewitness reportage of a camera filming, unedited, down local &#8216;High Streets&rsquo;, taking in all that any casual walker will see.<br>
 Now how can that possibly described as &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;hateful&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has the means to do so is free to travel to London and walk the streets and see for themselves.<br>
 Travel to such neighborhoods as Wembley, Southall, Ealing, Acton, Harrow, Greenford, Hackney, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, East Ham, Ilford, Peckham, Lewisham, Tooting, Elephant &amp; Castle, Thornton Heath, Brixton, Harlesden, Tottenham etc etc.<br>
 Just walk down the main thoroughfares as a cold, objective eyewitness with no prejudices and no axes to grind.Just take in what you see around you.<br>
 Now, that is all these videos purport to do.They are nothing more and nothing less than the cold seeing eye of a video camera being pointed down a &#8216;High Street&rsquo;, unedited and purely recording life as it goes on.<br>
 So how can this possibly be construed racist? - How can reportage of reality be possibly described &#8216;racist&rsquo; - this just shows how desperate and irrational the enemies of the BNP are.</p>

		<p>Nationality is not the same as race.  The borders between France and England have moved around; for example, The Hundred Years War saw the border in western France move quite a bit.  The author would have a better case arguing Celtic vs. Nordic inhabitants of Britain.   </p>
<p>The real issue is the displacement of the indigenous population.  Lefties go into a swoon if some native tribe in New Guinea has a Western mining company build a town in its region, yet scream &#8216;racist&rsquo; if I don&rsquo;t want to press &#8216;1&rsquo; for English.</p>

		<p>This is nothing less than genocide of White people. The governments of most White nations are traiters. Until all non-Whites, who are nothing less than invaders and the Whites who support them are kicked out of Europe, our struggle will go on. Let these liberal traiters live in Pakistan or Nigeria. After all those countries are just like England to them. You must realise that our elites hate us. Get this straight in your head. Our elites in the government, in the media, in academia and even in industry hate us and are our enemies. Everytime we watch and pay for cable TV or for movies, we are helping our enemies, everytime we pay taxes we are helping our enemy and the enemy of our children. <br>
If our governments were really concerned about us they would have been like the Indian government for example</p>
<p><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Biz-visas-to-Chinese-Tharoor-assures-steps-to-stop-misuse/articleshow/5184156.cms" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Biz-visas-to-Chinese-Tharoor-assures-steps-to-stop-misuse/articleshow/5184156.cms</a><br>
Last year, the Indian government had issued 58,500 business visas to Chinese nationals. </p>
<p>In case of skilled workers, it would be imperative to prove that the particular skill was not available in India.</p>
<p>http://trak.in/news/illegal-workers-on-business-visa-asked-to-leave-india-by-oct-31/17986/</p>
<p><br>
http://trak.in/news/tharoor-concerned-about-misuse-of-indian-business-visas/19059/<br>
Tharoor said it was &lsquo;a concern for three ministries – External Affairs, Home ministry and Labour Ministry&rsquo;. <br>
&lsquo;If unskilled workers are coming with these visas, they are taking the jobs of Indian unskilled workers,&rsquo; he said. </p>
<p><br>
Source: Tharoor concerned about misuse of Indian business visas.</p>
<p>Contrast the concern for Indian workers in the Indian government to the complete indifference Western governments have for their own labourers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the USA, founded in 1776 by and for &#8216;white people&rsquo;, the mongrelization of culture continues, exemplified by high crime rates and a profound ignorance by its citizens of those principles that made this country great.</p>
<p>As the non-white immigration builds over time to its majority-voter status, white people will probably realize too late what many of us understand right now: what is happening to white displacement all over Europe is headed our way, and sooner than you think!</p>

		<p>&#8220;the video &ldquo;Spot the White Man&rdquo; has been removed from Youtube. However, I can easily find NOFX&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kill the White Man&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tube had to ban it because the UAF started a campaign on their blogs encouraging other lefties to complain about it&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s so much a reason as an excuse and a rationalization. If there were vocal support for &#8216;Spot the white man&rsquo; Youtube would say something about supporting principles over public opinion and it would still get the boot. </p>

		<p>Even if the writer&rsquo;s surprising claim that a quarter of the English have French blood were true it would constitute no knock-down argument against the transformation of once homogeneously white, English neighbourhoods into exclusively third-world slums (as accurately and ungainsayably documented by the &#8220;racist&#8221; videos).</p>
<p>It is possible (although unlikely) that a quarter of the English population have some NORMAN blood; possible because the Normans did indeed conquer and settle in England, unlikely because they constituted a small, elite ruling class who would have been unlikely to interbreed extensively with the Anglo-Saxon/Norse  majority. (Incidentally, it is worth pointing out to our French poster that the Celtic peoples of Wales, Scotland and Ireland have stubbornly remained ethnically and culturally distinct from the predominantly Anglo-Saxon and Norse indigenous people of England, whom they continue to dislike and denigrate.)  </p>

		<p>By reading this fools statements, I am convinced that he and ALL other deluded multi-cults believe that the entire globe was created and built up by every other race of human kind, EXCEPT for the EVIL white race, who usurped the other racial groups from their pre-eminent positions and enslaved them. It always intrigues me how such high achieving, intensely brilliant and creative brown &#8220;super cultures&#8221; were so easily deposed by such a wretched, lazy, war mongering and physically inferior white race; how we stole &#8220;their&#8221; ideas and built up our societies on &#8220;their&#8221; backs, while we sat on purple satin pillows being fed grapes by beautiful nubian princesses. You would think that these lofty minds could have conspired to rid the Earth of, as Susan Sontag so poignantly stated, &#8220;the cancer of human history.</p>
<p>This article enlightened me to the fact(?) that the French aren&rsquo;t white! WHAT AN EPIPHANY!! I have been deceived all these years! Damn my public school education!</p>
