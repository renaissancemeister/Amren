<h1>BusinessWeek Names Tinley Park Best Place in U.S. to Raise A Family</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristen Schorsch, Chicago Tribune, November 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Turns out there is life south of 95th Street, despite what some North Siders might think. And it&rsquo;s a slice of &#8220;real Midwest Americana,&#8221; according to Tinley Park Mayor Ed Zabrocki.</p>
<p>This week BusinessWeek named south suburban Tinley Park the best place in the U.S. to raise a family.</p>
<p>The village of roughly 60,000 is known as much for its quaint mom-and-pop shops along Oak Park Avenue as for its big-box economic development.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BusinessWeek teamed up with Onboard Informatics, which provides real estate data, to compile the rankings. It picked towns that have at least 45,000 residents and a median income of between $40,000 and $125,000. Then the towns were rated on criteria such as school test scores, crime rates, job growth and amenities such as parks and museums.</p>
<p>The magazine noted Tinley Park&rsquo;s low crime rate but also mentioned that it&rsquo;s had its blemishes. Five women were shot dead on Feb. 2, 2008, at a Lane Bryant women&rsquo;s clothing store. There have been no arrests. And Wednesday a woman was in court facing a hate crime charge for an incident involving a Muslim woman in a Tinley Park grocery store.</p>

		<p>Some groups that do these &#8220;best places to live&#8221; ratings have noticed that their &#8220;best places&#8221; tend to be almost all white, so they have added &#8220;diversity&#8221; as an indicator, i.e. not considering cities that are more than 95% white.  When they did that, the cities near the top were 90-95% white, most of the minorities being Oriental.</p>

<p>&#8220;Village&#8221; of 60,000 people?? Only a publication like Business Week is capable of such an attempt to redefine words in the English language.( control the language, contol the thoughts of the masses) &#8220;Big-box economic development&#8221; on the other hand seems to be a spot on linguistic nugget. </p>
<p>Tinley Park sounds like the kind of place that has thusfar managed to dodge the depression by hook or crook. This time next year it will be property tax adjustment hearings for all the bankrupt retail shopping strip owners and lawyers will be the biggest industry.</p>

		<p>Anti Hate Laws are stupid, and unconstitutional.  They are designed<br>
to protect one segment of society, and not to protect society as<br>
a whole.  They are designed for political favors, and votes for<br>
corrupt politicians, and government officials. <br>
Political Liberalisms always lead to totalitarianism, and a police<br>
state. </p>

		<p>I live near Tinley Park.  It&rsquo;s about 95% White and is the place where Rev. Wright, Obama&rsquo;s former pastor has his million dollar home in a gated community.  The woman who pulled the headscarf if in her 50&rsquo;s the &#8220;victim&#8221; in her 20&rsquo;s, and American born.  The old lady will probably go to the Fed. Pen for pulling the scarf.  Too much PC in America.</p>

		<p>Tinley Park, IL had better hope that the word doesn&rsquo;t spread to far and fastt about it being the best town in the USA to raise a family. That&rsquo;s all blacks and Hmongs and mestizos need to hear.</p>
<p>I note the article failed to mention the shooter in the Lane Bryant killings was a Bantu, as were three of the five victims.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, these &#8220;best urban areas&#8221; designations don&rsquo;t really mean much. In 1960, East St. Louis, IL was named as one of America&rsquo;s top cities to live and work in, as difficult as it is to believe nowadays.</p>

<b>Tinley Park:</b>  I never heard of the place until now.  Looking it up, I see that  it is one of the fastest growing American suburbs.  It  grew from 48,401 in  2000, to 58,322 by  2007.   An increase of ten thousand in a mere seven years!  </p>
<p>What accounts for this amazing growth?  Well, let&rsquo;s see, it&rsquo;s per cap. income is only $25,000 so its&rsquo; not that prosperous a community.   But its demography is 93.16% White,  and  only 1.92% black.  This in the shadow of Chicago! Amazing.   Aha!   Could that possibly have anything to do with it&rsquo;s allure?   Are these white-flight refugees fleeing  the racial chaos and mayhem of Chicago?</p>
<p>Interestingly too, I see that Tinley Park is not very welcoming to out-of-towners. According to the Wiki article:  <i> &#8220;Sticker Shock For Outsiders   &mdash;  -  If you visit the township of Tinley Park to do some shopping or eat and you do not have a Tinley Park city sticker  or another city sticker YOU WILL RECEIVE A TICKET.   It does not matter that the place where you live may not require a city sticker. This policy seems at direct odds with the Mayor&rsquo;s first sentence of his welcome page.&#8221;  </i> It seems that you have to PURCHASE a city sticker.  I never heard of such a thing as this, but it&rsquo;s an obvious strategy to keep out the kind of people that the new residents are trying to get away from. </p>
<p>Of course, we can all read between the lines,  although none of this is ever put forth in racial terms. (Heavens, they&rsquo;re not racists or anything terrible like THAT!)  What a shame that  white America  is by now so cornered that it is forced to resort to such  subterfuges and hypocrisy, instead of just admitting that we prefer to be with our own kind.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Tinley Park.  It&rsquo;s the center of community mental health services for Cook County.  As such, it is the dumping ground for drug users, criminals and psychopaths from all over Chicago.  That&rsquo;s who is roaming the neighborhood&hellip;..murderers, rapists and thieves, many of whom have serious psychotic disorders (the majority simply pretend, however), all high on crack, meth or something worse.</p>
<p>In response to 6 above, all of Chicago is like that.  It has to do with conflicts with tourists over parking.  They use up all the parking the people who live there, rely on.  So the city solves this by issuing stickers.  You must have the correct sticker in order to park in certain zones.  Eligibility is based on having a valid residential address.  This makes sure that someone coming home from work can park their car without all the spots being filled by shoppers from out of town.  Shoppers need to go to a parking garage and PAY to park their car.</p>

<p>Right, not too far from Chi, and not that wealthy, and not a whole lot extra. What is it then. Prosperity of an average sort for the most part, very good schools, very low crime, etc. Naperville, IL., right next to where I live, was # 1 just a few years ago too. Wealthier, but not that much more than Tinley, good schools, very low crime, etc.</p>
<p>As others that have commented have noted, Tinley is where the notorious Reverend Wright [Wrong] is living now, in retirement. Among those whitey that he hates so strongly.</p>
<p>Tinley and Naper have little if any Section 8 housing? Well, don&rsquo;t let the gov know about this. They will make the beeline to rectify the situation.</p>

		<p>Tinley Park (and nearby wealthier Orland Park) are where many southside Catholics (Irish, Poles, and Italians) fled to from the southside of the city of Chicago as blacks moved in.  </p>

I doubt if these people are &#8220;tourists&#8221;.  (Does Tinley  Park get that much tourism?)   But shoppers, yes.</p>
<p>It appears they don&rsquo;t want to encourage shoppers coming in from outside.  In fact, it looks like they want to DIScourage shoppers coming from out of town.  i.e.Chicago  (I wonder who those shoppers might be?)</p>

		<p>The black male that murdered the 5 women is at large and will most likely never be caught. The white woman who pulled on a &#8220;hajib&#8221; THANK GOD the brilliant police have gotten her off the streets! Oh thank you dear authorities for protecting US!</p>

		<p>As was mentioned in an earlier post this is the suburb where Obama&rsquo;s pastor for 20 years, (the Rev. Wright)lives.</p>
<p>Am I the only one to see the irony of the Rev. Wright choosing to live in a 95% white suburb?</p>

<p>Right, the villain is s till at large. The interstate passes right by Tinley. The thug probably was cruising up and down the interstate looking for some place to rob and just picked on Tinley and the Lane Bryant store.</p>
<p>A year ago they had over forty cops working on the case and no real leads or suspects. And the cops too said that local blacks were seemingly hesitant to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>That crime will be solved when some other thug is arrested for murder in TX, NYC, FLA, and is facing a long prison sentence. Will give away the name of the killer in return for a plea bargin.</p>
