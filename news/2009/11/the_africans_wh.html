<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8344170.stm">The Africans Who Fought in WWII</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Plaut, BBC News, November 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 70th anniversary of World War II is being commemorated around the world, but the contribution of one group of soldiers is almost universally ignored. How many now recall the role of more than one million African troops?</p>
<p>Yet they fought in the deserts of North Africa, the jungles of Burma and over the skies of Germany. A shrinking band of veterans, many now living in poverty, bitterly resent being written out of history.</p>
<p>For Africa, World War II began not in 1939, but in 1935.</p>
<p>Italian Fascist troops, backed by thousands of Eritrean colonial forces, invaded Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Emperor Haile Selassie was forced to flee to the UK, but others, known as Patriots, fought on. Among them was Jagama Kello. Fifteen years old at the time, he left home and raised a guerrilla force that struck at the Italian invaders.</p>
<p><b>Mein Kampf</b></p>
<p>Other Africans learnt what Fascism could mean for them. Among them was John Henry Smythe of Sierra Leone. His teacher gave him Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s book, Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>&#8220;We read what this man was going to do to the blacks if he gets into power. And he attacked the British and Americans for encouraging the blacks to become doctors and lawyers,&#8221; Mr Smythe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a book which would put any black man&rsquo;s back up and it put mine up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He volunteered to join the Royal Air Force, becoming a navigator, flying bombers over Germany. Others took a similar view.</p>
<p>Joe Culverwell, who went on to fight for the liberation of Zimbabwe, volunteered the day war was declared in 1939.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t forget in those days we were very loyal Brits  &mdash;  stupid as that may sound now,&#8221; Mr Culverwell says. &#8220;We were brainwashed into being little brown Britishers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others were conscripted. They were picked up when they went to visit a local market or on the orders of a local chief.</p>
<p>And many found that once they enlisted they were badly treated. The reality of military life for African soldiers like Nigerian Marshall Kebby was very different from the propaganda.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a colonial soldier I had very rough treatment. At that time we hadn&rsquo;t even a single Nigerian officer, all were British. And many of us revolted against injustice, what I might call man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Hell&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But once the fighting began there was little time for protest. For men like Mr Culverwell, serving in Somalia, being bombed by the Italians was a terrifying experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy that was hell. We all had foxholes. I never felt so frightened in my life. They were bombing 100 yards away. We daren&rsquo;t even look up, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Smythe took part in air-raids over enemy territory.</p>
<p>But on the night of 18 November 1943 his plane was shot down over the German city of Mannheim. He spent 18 months in a prisoner of war camp, where the Germans tried to extract intelligence from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must use some special instruments to navigate your way here,&#8221; his interrogator told Mr Smythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;I want you to co-operate to get you out of this place.&rsquo; I said: &#8216;I will give you my name and number&rsquo;. He started to scream at me; became a real Nazi officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;You know they are talking about whether to execute you tomorrow or not. Because you, as a black man, should not involve in white man&rsquo;s war.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Meeting Gandhi</b></p>
<p>On the other side of the world, Mr Kebby was meeting Indians.</p>
<p>Among them was the leader of India&rsquo;s independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, who was addressing a crowd of one million people in Madras. Mr Kebby worked his way to the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of the greatest things I did as a soldier. I greeted Gandhi with a military salute and asked him: &#8216;What are you going to do for Africa now that India is going to be free?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;India will not do anything for you. But India will give you moral support on condition you fight the British non-violently&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 1945 the war was over, African troops had helped the allied powers defeat Germany, Italy and Japan.</p>
<p>Graphic, showing the numbers of African soldiers involved in WWII</p>
<p>Mr Culverwell remembers talking to other black soldiers he met about what would happen to them now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to have long chats about the colour problem and we were determined that we were not going to be treated that way any more.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Freedom fighters</b></p>
<p>But for most Africans independence was still 15 years away.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the veterans had to get home and find a job.</p>
<p>Many found little gratitude for their years of service and no work.</p>
<p>In February 1948 veterans from Ghana, among them Kalimu Glover went to petition the governor.</p>
<p>But instead of receiving them, police opened fire. It sparked off an outpouring of anger on the streets of Accra.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the shooting, we said we should damage all British things in the city. We got stones, sticks to break down shops. We broke them all down. Those were wonderful days: February 1948, Saturday to Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Kebby is convinced that he and others like him helped end colonial rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every soldier who went to India got new ideas and learnt new things. We came back with improved ideas about life. We, the ex-servicemen, gave this country the freedom it&rsquo;s enjoying today. We gave this freedom and handed it over to our country.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Given the Nazi view of blacks, it is incredible these veterans have any doubts about which side they should have been on and whether fighting for Britain was the right thing to do. They had their chance to oppose the British after the war. For all the discrimination by Britain, colonial rule was still preferable to the Nkrumahs and Mugabes the blacks stupidly put in power in place of civilized British law and order. </p>

		<p>I always find that articles like this take extraordinary liberties with the truth. A million Africans? Fighting as a single force? Sorry, I simply can&rsquo;t imagine it being possible. They would shoot each other over the days rations.</p>

		<p>The African Soldiers go from being proud to be Western, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t forget in those days we were very loyal Brits &mdash; stupid as that may sound now,&#8221; to embracing Ghandi. Why not embrace Jefferson or even FDR? both who did more to end colonialism (and acted to do so across the globe). The anti-racists mistakenly believe they are fighting racism, when in fact they live it and promote it to others. </p>

		<p>The claims regarding all these third worlders who fought for the allies seem to be plucked out of the thin air with their unbelievable figures. A number of Indians fought in Burma but that was their fight too.<br>
They should really mention our African &#8216;brothers&rsquo; appalling ability as soldiers, balck units in Korea always had to have a white one placed behind them for when the cowards ran, and of course the war crimes they committed from rape to thieving.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Given the Nazi view of blacks&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 And what was that view exactly?!? I know that jazz was considered degenerate jungle music  and Jesse Owens was snubbed on the podium but other than that I don`t recall in reading over two dozen plus  books on the regime and its leaders much of anything about policy or politics concerning the subject. I get the general view that it was a non problem for the Reich or at worst someone elses problem. Simply put in was a non issue for the then all-White European countries under their control. I get the feeling that it  morphed post war  into a way to paint any White Nationalists as a threat tantamount to favoring Black extermination. Does anyone have information or facts to show otherwise? Kind of like being accused of hating alligators if you live in Iceland&hellip; Just doesn`t add up to me.<br>

		<p>  As far as I can discover, blacks were not sent to Nazi concentration camps. In addition, the blacks of Paris seemed to be relatively unmolested by the Nazis, i.e. Josephine Baker. The Nazi&rsquo;s did think that blacks were inferior so it was a doctrine harmful to blacks. A Nazi victory would have been a disaster for all. As to the African contribution to the British war effort, I would categorize it as small to insignificant.</p>

		<p><i>The 70th anniversary of World War II is being commemorated around the world, but the contribution of one group of soldiers is almost universally ignored. How many now recall the role of more than one million African troops?</i></p>
<p>How many now recall the role of Muslim troops? How many recall the role of Sikh troops? Heck, how many students today can even name the major theatres of involvement, the more minor nations involved, or the trigger that started WWII? </p>
<p>The fact is that most people are ignorant of history  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s a lot of it to remember after all  &mdash;  but guilt-mongering articles like these are calculated to provide steady grist for the racial grievance industry.</p>
<p>And as far as Mr. Culverwell, if he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a &#8220;little brown Brit,&#8221; there&rsquo;s always an easy solution for him and his ilk (hint: it involves one-way tickets out of the country).</p>

		<p>For a more accurate view of an all black force facing the enemy please read the accounts of the US Army&rsquo;s 24th Infantry Regiment(Colored) during the Korean War.  Rioting before they even left Japan for Korea, jr black officers tried for being cowards.  Mass &#8220;bug-outs&#8221; from the 24th Inf Rgmt once attacked.  Giving up to the enemy without firing a shot.  Having to be backed up by white regiments and MPs going into Korean villages to return to duty members of this disgraced regiment who were having sex, getting drunk, and doing drugs.  Finally, the Army disbanded the regiment and assigned the members throughout the US 8th Army.  During the Clinton administration Clinton restored the 24th Inantry Regiment back to active duty.  The unofficial motto of the 24th Regiment during the Korean War started with:  &#8220;When the mortars began to thud, the &#8220;Duece Four&#8221; began to bug.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself, if Hitler had won, Blacks where they existed in any numbers would have been either killed or brutalized or deported to Africa. The number of Blacks in Europe was so tiny during WW2 that Hitler would have viewed them as a rarity and left them alone but in any numbers, they would have been killed.</p>
