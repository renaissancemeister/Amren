<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Since the start of his presidency, U.S. President Barack Obama&rsquo;s approval rating has declined more among non-Hispanic whites than among nonwhites, and now, fewer than 4 in 10 whites approve of the job Obama is doing as president.</p>

<p>Obama last week fell below 50% approval in Gallup Daily tracking for the first time in his presidency, both in daily three-day rolling averages and in Gallup Daily tracking results aggregated weekly.</p>
<p>In his first full week in office (Jan. 26-Feb. 1), an average of 66% of Americans approved of the job Obama was doing, including 61% of non-Hispanic whites and 80% of nonwhites. In the most recent week, spanning Nov. 16-22 interviewing, his approval rating averaged 49% overall, 39% among whites, and 73% among nonwhites. Thus, since the beginning of his presidency, his support has dropped 22 points among whites, compared with a 7-point loss among nonwhites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks&rsquo; support for Obama has averaged 93% during his time in office, and has been at or above 90% nearly every week during his presidency. Thus, part of the reason Obama&rsquo;s support among nonwhites has not dropped as much as his support among other groups is because of his consistent support from blacks. (With Hispanics&rsquo; approval rating down five points, greater declines among Asians, Native Americans, and those of mixed races account for his total seven-point drop among nonwhites.)</p>
<p>The accompanying table shows how Obama&rsquo;s approval rating has changed by subgroup from his first full week in office to the most recent week. The only subgroup showing a greater change than whites is Republicans, down 24 points during this time. Independents&rsquo; approval of Obama has declined nearly as much (down 18 points), whereas support among Democrats is down only 6 points.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s strongest support comes from blacks, Democrats, and liberals  &mdash;  all of whom give him approval ratings above 80%. He maintains solid support of more than 60% from nonwhites, Hispanics, and young adults.</p>

<p><b>A Closer Look at Race and Party</b></p>
<p>One reason Obama may have maintained support among blacks is their overwhelming affiliation with the Democratic Party. This is not a sufficient explanation, though, because Obama&rsquo;s approval rating has dropped among Democrats even as it has held steady among blacks.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears as though Obama&rsquo;s relatively small loss in support among Democrats has come exclusively from white Democrats. In late January/early February, Obama averaged 87% approval among white Democrats and 90% approval among nonwhite Democrats. Now, his approval rating among white Democrats is 76%, down 11 points, but is essentially the same (if not a little higher) at 92% among nonwhite Democrats.</p>

<p><b>Bottom Line</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is important to note that this pattern is not unique to Obama. For example, Bill Clinton averaged 55% job approval during his presidency, including 52% among whites but a much higher 76% among nonwhites and 82% among blacks.</p>

		<p>You know, Obama must be blamed,certainly, but I think by now, every intelligent person knows that what the conspiracy types have been saying for years is true. It isn&rsquo;t the President that runs America. Who is it then? Obviously, it&rsquo;s the huge corporations that are in sync with Wall Street, that&rsquo;s who. The first order of business for President Obama, was to pay back his supporters  &mdash;  at Golman Sachs. All Americans need to do to clarify their thinking, is to take it from there. Why continue to doubt the obvious.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said over and over again that Obama&rsquo;s approval rating needs to be lowered 10% to get a more accurate figure because he always has a 90% approval rating among blacks, who are about 12-13% of the population. If one takes this into account, he really isn&rsquo;t any more popular than Bush was.</p>
<p>I was making an estimate, but this poll shows that my hunch is exactly correct.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there&rsquo;s a subconscious race factor present in whites which prompts some of them to approve of Obama when they really disapprove, but are afraid to say so even on the phone.</p>
<p>The important thing is that his poll numbers are declining.  I&rsquo;m waiting for him to lose an important political battle, like healthcare, then be placed under severe stress, like a terrorist attack when the show trials are underway for the terrorists in NY.  I&rsquo;m fairly certain his black ego just can&rsquo;t withstand a couple of hits like these, and I look for him to get ghetto nasty and slip a time or two to reveal his anti-white racism.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s disturbing that 39% of whites could be so clueless.  Anyone with a modicum of street smarts can see that Obama has no real leadership abilities, hates whites, and dislikes much of the US.  He does not have the best interests of the US at heart.  In fact, it&rsquo;s highly probable that he has a great deal of antipathy towards the US in general and would like to see the entire &#8220;experiment&#8221; fail and be replaced with something akin to what exists in Cuba or Venezuela right now,. </p>

		<p>Whites are realizing that he is two things, a black racialist and a socialist with an intent of wealth redistribution. Blacks and Hispanics are all about redistribution of other peoples wealth to them or government programs that heavily favor them. His election from the onset was going to exascerbate the racial divides. </p>
<p>Plus he sucks as President, he is the ultimate affirmative action candidate. I think he was born in the US but I think he is a Moslem though, in a sense he is a &#8220;Manchurian Candidate&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is the second attack on America.<br/>

		<p>Obama won only 44% of the white vote in the election.  I know some of these folks were ideological youth, dizzy liberals, and/or hardcore Dems.  Somehow, I guess, their support has slipped a tad.<br/>
Some of the blame for Obama&rsquo;s election has to be laid on illegal practices (like Mickey Mouse voting), but I personally blame the moderate to conservative white people who sat home in a funk and wouldn&rsquo;t move their stumps down to the polls to cast a ballot against him.  Almost everyone knew he had ties to Communists and afrocentrists, but, amazingly, far too many did nothing to stop him. </p>

		<p>Irony: he&rsquo;s white, not black by every measurement of family, social affiliation and education. The wife is a political adornment designed for Chicago politics. He&rsquo;s a white, neoJewish liberal Chicago Democrat. If whites bullet vote for a white candidate, they are racist. If blacks too dumb to know Obama isn&rsquo;t black support him even as he wrecks the economy, that&rsquo;s &#8220;pride&#8221;. Yeah brothers n sisters: send a hundred bucks donations to Harvard Law School, morons.</p>

		<p>I doubt if Obama&rsquo;s approval rating is even 39% among whites or even if blacks still love him all that much. Black are all going to say they love Obama because that&rsquo;s expected of them and no one wants to be a traitor to the cause. </p>
<p>If you want to find out how people really feel about someone it takes a lot more than just asking questions. We are such a brainwashed society that many people will just give the answers to questions that they think will conform to popular views on a subject, any subject. </p>
<p>I have a friend that&rsquo;s afraid of his own shadow so he assumes that the government monitors his every phone call or move and he is afraid of giving any answer that could be considered subversive.</p>
<p>I think most people deep down hate our government and not just Obama because they know what a rotten, corrupt mess the whole thing is but they are afraid to speak up even when answering poll questions. </p>

		<p>oldwhitelady makes some good points. Obama is not and was never the president of White America. He got only 44% of whites, and the percentage would have been even lower had the republicans (aka the stupid party) nominated someone worth voting for, other than the pseudo-conservative, clueless John McCain. Many conservative whites stayed home on election day, finding both candidates uttelrly repulsive to their beliefs and values. The fact that non-whites ended up with their choice for president and one year out they (but not a majority of whites) have the man they support in the white house is proof that Whites have truely lost control of the country they founded and built. </p>

<p>Why?  Palin is George Bush in a skirt, except worse.  The thought of our foreign policy in that woman&rsquo;s hands would almost make me consider voting to re-elect Obama.  Not to mention, she supports amnesty.  Wonder how many of her supporters know that?  </p>

		<p>Nice point about the Bell Curve, Mulubabe!  I am a firm believer that &#8220;the truth will out&#8221; in every case, and Obama is no exception.  (There ARE no exceptions).  I told a friend the other day that I choose competency over color every time - and I am quite certain that the incompetency of Obama AND his Czars AND his Cabinet AND Pelosi and Reid   &mdash;   will become so painfully apparent to the American people as a whole that the Dems will lose big in 2010 and in 2012.  Blacks will NEVER admit Obama&rsquo;s an idiot, just like the vast majority of blacks will never admit that OJ was guilty; they choose race over competency every single time.  That in itself is the mark of an inferior mind and an immature outlook.  Nope, Prof. Rushton had it right.  Look to the folks with brains - Asians, most whites, and Jews   &mdash;   for your salvation in just about every world topic.  The brainless are not going to be all that relevant in the future.  And, Mother Nature may give us a hand in dishing out a bunch of world calamities that will force the people with brains to take over!  </p>

If they are only THAT percentage of the population, how is it that they were able to destroy most of our major cities and public school systems and to make life in the USA a living Hell? If they are only 13% of the population then why can&rsquo;t we put an end to their atrocious behavior? </p>

		<p>Young, white college aged adults come out to vote every four years for presidential elections, and they are the ones that got Obama elected.  Now that they aren&rsquo;t seeing the instant change Obama led them to believe would happen - whatever they thought that was, and in fact harder times (tuition going up 32% in CA), they aren&rsquo;t so motivated by &rsquo;60s style idealism and &#8220;having a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>The irony of that is that I knew that Democrats winning all branches of government would lead to increases in college tuition almost everywhere, big increases.</p>
<p>The college and university system is nothing more than a youth auxiliary of the Democrat Party.  Any time a Democrat politician babbles on about wanting to &#8220;make college more affordable,&#8221; it actually makes it less affordable.  They push for lower student loan rates so that students can take out bigger loans with higher principles, plus more grant money.  This gives the signal to college administrators to raise tuition.  This funnels more money through academia, and some of this I&rsquo;m sure finds its way back into the coffers of Democrat politicians.</p>

Asians are increasingly voting along anti-white lines and sadly too many Jews are stuck voting left, still brainwashed by their &#8220;community leaders&#8221; who are generally leftist - Marxist big mouths. </p>

		<p>I think (at least I hope) that this decline in approval is due to the fact that the First Empty Suit&rsquo;s campaign promises for &#8220;change&#8221; are finally being seen as the self-serving lies they were last year.  After promising to reduce the presence of lobbyists in Washington DC, Obama is spearheading an expansion of the role of government that can only increase the power the interest groups will wield.  It is impossible to put government in the business of handing out money and favors willy-nilly without special interests trying to pay legislators to vote their way.  Without a national income tax, the government wouldn&rsquo;t be in the role of playing Santa Claus; there would&rsquo;t be the money, but the only way to eliminate that is to allow things to completely collapse and have a revolution.  &#8220;Worse&#8221;, as people have said here, &#8220;is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, this isn&rsquo;t really Obama&rsquo;s doing or his fault.  The same voters who elected Obama last year also gave precisely the same party that got us into this economic mess MORE POWER.  Bush II was no great shakes, but he had less responsibility for the recession or the deficit than the Federal Reserve Bank and the House of Representatives (from whence all spending bills originate).  Obama and Bush II are both merely front-men for the failure of our corrupt one-and-a-half party system.</p>
<p>Now that I have pinned the blame where it really belongs (congress), I must ask: <br/>
(1) What sort of creature really wants to be a congressman today, and why?  While egregious crooks like Randy &#8220;Duke&#8221; Cunningham (a white Republican Vietnam hero) may be uncommon, there are myriad other - legal - ways in which to &#8220;cash-in&#8221; on the system once elected.  <br/>
(2) What sort of electorate continues to elect and reelect these corrupt dingbats, and why?  A classic example of this is the voting public of Massachusetts reelecting Ted Kennedy to the US Senate for an additional 40 years after he killed a woman in 1969.  On a local level, the reelection of Coleman Young as the mayor of Detroit is the same thing; he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;sticking it to Whitey&#8221;; he was driving out the businesses on which black residents of Detroit once depended to make a living.  Instead of being outraged, they reelected him.  Instead of being outraged at the venal morons we are offered by the mainstream parties (really; if McCain, Palin, Obama and Biden were the &#8220;best&#8221; this country could produce as candidates for Executive office, there is no hope for us) we vote for them.</p>
<p>I was receiving GOP email from Michael Steele until last week, when I responded with vitriol that - if posted here - would have me quickly banned for life from Amren.  Perhaps it is unfair of me to hold the GOP to a higher standard, but I expect a party I support to look out for my own interests.  I think McCain, as an amnesty and H-1b voter, is a corporate &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; lapdog.  I think Palin is an idiot.  Despite Obama&rsquo;s decline in popularity, WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME MESS NOW EVEN IF THE GOP HAD WON THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>
<p>The problem is with the two parties themselves.  They treat the US public as if we were idiots, and from the way we act, they&rsquo;re right to do so.</p>
