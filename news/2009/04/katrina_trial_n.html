<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0422/p02s10-usgn.html">Katrina Trial: New Orleans&rsquo; Truth Commission</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [S]ix plaintiffs are suing the US Army Corps of Engineers over the creation and maintenance of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (&#8220;Mr. GO&#8221;), a shipping channel that they say introduced fatal risk to a fragile levee-protection system. The government argues that the magnitude of the storm, by itself, caused the flooding of New Orleans, the deaths of more than 700 city residents, and $90 billion of damage across the region.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A win by the plaintiffs  &mdash;  six hurricane survivors, including a local TV news anchor and his wife  &mdash;  in this &#8220;first real Katrina trial&#8221; could pave the way for a class-action lawsuit against the Corps, as well as set the tone for future US coastal policy.</p>
<p>But for many New Orleanians  &mdash;  especially those in the hard-hit St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, and the Lower Ninth Ward  &mdash;  the Mr. GO trial represents their own form of truth commission: It&rsquo;s a chance not just to lay blame, but also to bridge what has been called a &#8220;deep gorge of distrust&#8221; between residents and the US agency charged with protecting them from the sea.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Category 3 hurricane, Katrina tore through New Orleans on a Monday morning. On Tuesday, as the sun shone and residents began to relax, water came pouring through the streets as high waters broke and overtopped levees.</p>
<p>In the Lower Ninth Ward, Jimmy Braxton&rsquo;s sister climbed with her two small kids into the attic. Holding the kids, she craned for air as the water rose. Another relative swam to the house and busted through the roof. She had to let go of one of the kids to reach through the hole. Only one child survived.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Braxton lives with that image  &mdash;  and his sister&rsquo;s choice  &mdash;  every day. The fact that a favorable verdict in the Mr. GO case could mean a future class-action lawsuit  &mdash;  possibly with cash damages for residents  &mdash;  doesn&rsquo;t assuage him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you pay us for my family&rsquo;s loss or put a price on these scars?&#8221; said Braxton, a graying, lanky black man standing on a deserted street in the Lower Ninth Ward on Tuesday. &#8220;No dollar amount in the world can heal the pain and suffering&#8221; of watching the storm&rsquo;s devastation.</p>
<p>At the same time, he adds, &#8220;If the Corps didn&rsquo;t do its job, somebody should be held responsible. Somebody&rsquo;s got to answer to something.&#8221;</p>
<p>At stake in the trial is between $10 billion and $100 billion in possible damages, on top of the $107 billion that US taxpayers have already poured into the rebuilding of New Orleans and the devastated Mississippi Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The federal Flood Control Act gives the Corps broad immunity and discretion, acknowledging the unforeseen risks that are implicit when people carve into the natural environment. But by allowing the case to go to court, the judge in the Mr. GO case rejected the Corps&rsquo; assertions of &#8220;sovereign immunity&#8221; from lawsuits involving floods.</p>
<p>&#8220;If successful, this case will set the tone for the future and enable people in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, and the Lower Ninth Ward to seek redress for damages for what happened to them,&#8221; says Elisa Gilbert, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, the Mr. GO case could inspire a bevy of lawsuits against the government and the Corps, also forcing Congress to get involved, says Erich Rapp, a Baton Rouge-based lawyer who blogs on coastal issues. A middle position would be for Congress to ask the US Court of Federal Claims &#8220;to look at the federal government&rsquo;s culpability&#8221; in preventing disasters like Katrina, Mr. Rapp says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A Category 3 hurricane, Katrina tore through New Orleans on a Monday morning. On Tuesday, as the sun shone and residents began to relax, water came pouring through the streets as high waters broke and overtopped levees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on the flipside of this, were not the residents of the &ldquo;communities&rdquo; of color in question told to get out of the area, well before this happened?</p>
<p>Enough said there, other than that the US government should be imprisoning or executing the fools who stayed and risked the lives of the National Guard and other rescue units forced to save them!</p>

			<p>The Army Corps of Engineers has been ordered by politicians to do an impossible task:  To keep the Mississippi River always and forever between the banks that existed a couple hundred years ago.  They try, which is why the levees are 30 feet above the city, if I remember correctly.  If the Corps hadn&rsquo;t been doing its assigned job, New Orleans would no longer be a major city.  It would be a swamp located on the former channel of the Mississippi, because the river would have switched its route to the Atchafelaya swamp long ago had not the Corps kept it in place.  Is the Corps supposed to build levees 50 feet high, with money that&rsquo;s not been appropriated?  I&rsquo;d argue for abandoning the place and its childish plaintiffs, except they might move near me.  </p>

Yes John. The first thing that needs to be established here is why they didn&rsquo;t heed the warnings and why they stayed (though I don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll ever get to the truth on that issue).</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;How can you pay us for my family&rsquo;s loss or put a price on these scars?&rdquo; said Braxton&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you take the warnings seriously and why didn&rsquo;t you leave?</p>
<p>Those &#8220;US agency charged with protecting them from the sea&#8221; TRIED to protect you but you didn&rsquo;t take them seriously. Now you want to blame them for the choice you made?</p>
<p>If those &#8220;US agency charged with protecting them from the sea&#8221; had gone in and dragged this woman and her children out kicking and screaming, she&rsquo;d be filing a suit for being traumatized and brutalized.</p>
<p>Blacks are always looking for the angle.<br>

			<p>Maybe illegals will be next on the lucrative if frivolous lawsuit bandwagon. Any illegal injured in an accident should sue the government for failing to keep them out of the country.</p>

			<p>Only a group of fools would expect someone to keep a city below sea level dry!  Any money spent there is a waste and I can not see why anyone in charge doesn&rsquo;t come to this conclusion. Oh well, its just Tax money and they spend all they want and answer to no one. Then the suits are because of trial lawyers, the second biggest threat to America, behind the American Federal Government. The poor Army Corp of Engineers are caught in the middle, working for a Government who does not support them and a bunch of worthless doo-daas who have lawyers trying to blame physical laws of nature on them&hellip;&hellip;it just goes along with everything else.  </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s some useful advice:  Never buy a house or rent an apartment situated on land that is below sea level, next to a huge lake, has the country&rsquo;s biggest river running through it, and is only a few miles from the Gulf of Mexico.  Land that is dry only because huge pumps run 24 hours a day pumping water out, paid for by white taxpayers.</p>
<p>Nah, just sue the Corps of Engineers instead.</p>

			<p>How about suing the Black mayor and those running the city, mostly Black, who could have evacuated the city and failed to do so?</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of incompetency to go around, regarding Katrina.  But some of those levees were pretty absurd.  Some were just walls, without the mass to resist barges banging against them.  The Corps of Engineers has a long history of incompetence and destructive projects.  The &#8216;Mr. Go&rsquo; was one of the Corps&rsquo; stupidest mistakes.  That&rsquo;s what the people are suing over.</p>
<p>That said, New Orleans is a great example of what America will be like, once its population is mostly non-white and semi-white: chaotic, miserable, and corrupt (but &#8216;vibrant&rsquo;).</p>

			<p>That they peck on the Engineers I find a little crass. Probably they thought it was the softest target.<br>
The Engineers had been warning against exactly that for some 25 years, and one year before Katrina their funds for reinforcing the dams were cut.<br>
(If they take the &#8220;Act of God&#8221; defense, as I think they will, it will be a manifest cover-up)</p>
<p>I agree with Trisket and WR - anybody with a minimum of knowledge of river dynamics and sedimentology (TSgt in the engineers and MSc in geology, thank you) would have foreseen something like that.<br>
Sooner or later, NOLA will go the way of Port Royal - literally.<br>
(Not meaning to sound frivolous, but I´d love to hear Pat Robertson´s comments on THAT.)</p>
<p>- As far as I can gather (I was not there so I depend on the Net), the grossest thing in the Katrina aftermath was the case of the USS Bataan. The captain went in immediately behind the storm, on his own responsibility. For those not familiar with what a landing ship is, it´s a self-contained supply base designed to sustain one Marine combat brigade. Within eight hours of Katrina, the Bataan was in position - with hospital facilities, supplies, tech specialists and heavy equipment - under the cicumstances enough for 20-30 thousand people. The captain deserved a medal, not a reprimand. Instead, he was denied permission to go in,for three full days - obviously from very high on. The Bushies´defense - posse comitatus - does not hold water: It does not apply to the Navy or Marines.<br>
Now THIS would make a suit - but one we obviously will not see.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, I think they were out for a looting and shooting party devoid of law enforcement. Or put another way, a Super Ghetto Mardi Gras!</p>
<p>They bit off far more than they could chew this time (since  &mdash;  unlike white officialdom  &mdash;  hurricanes and floods are not concerned with avoiding &ldquo;provoking&rdquo; them into greater violence, than they are already engaged in) and got a serious and well deserved corrective lesson by Mother Nature.</p>

			<p>Exactly, more handouts from their own creation.  Look, one of my best friends is a Wayne County Sheriff (that&rsquo;s where Detroit is) and he volunteered down there when it was all happening.  When he came back he had stab wounds as a &#8220;thanks&#8221; for trying to rescue the poor blacks that couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>He told me that it took so long to get the people out of there because the blacks refused to leave because they were stealing too much stuff.  Everyday he had to fight for every inch like it was a war!  The media NEVER said any of this.</p>
<p>My favorite part was when I asked him why it took so long to get the people out of the hospitals.  He laughed and said that the &#8220;victims&#8221; were looting all of the doctors&rsquo; cars and were bunkered down in the parking garage and actually SHOOTING at news, police, and rescue choppers.  That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll NEVER see film from the sky.  It reminds me of the movie &#8220;Black Hawk Down&#8221;, and who were the antagonists in that movie?</p>
<p>&hellip;We should have build a wall around the city and kept them all in.</p>
