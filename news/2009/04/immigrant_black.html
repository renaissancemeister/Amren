<h1>Immigrant Blacks Are Overrepresented in Certain Colleges, Studies Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abby Johnston, Daily Pennsylvanian (Philadelphia), April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to a new study, black students who are either first- or second-generation American are overrepresented at selective colleges and universities, compared with those whose families have resided in the United States longer.</p>
<p>This overrepresentation may stem from stereotypes  &mdash;  such as that immigrant blacks are smarter or work harder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conducted by sociology professors Pamela Bennett of Johns Hopkins University and Amy Lutz of Syracuse University, the study was similar in content to one published in 2007, co-authored by Penn Sociology professor Camille Charles and Douglas Massey, Margarita Mooney and Kimberly Torres of Princeton University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bennett and Lutz&rsquo;s research found that immigrant blacks make up the largest demographic proportionally of students who enrolled in college upon high school graduation. 75.1 percent of immigrant black high-school graduates attend college, compared to 72.5 percent of whites and 60.2 percent of native blacks.</p>
<p>While enrollment of immigrant rather than native black students is similar for two-year and nonselective, not historically black four-year colleges, the biggest gap for the two groups is found in selective colleges, which enroll a proportional majority of immigrant black students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Charles added that, to increase diversity at Penn and make the black student population representative of the larger black population of that age group, admissions officers must be more conscious of variances within the black community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Typical liberal intellectual trick. Dismiss the obvious reality as &#8216;stereotypes&rsquo; and get on with pushing your agenda. </p>

<p>Or, more likely than not, it stems from left-wing biased reporting with no regard for the truth, as is the case almost always.</p>
<p>Now tells us African blacks have an average group IQ higher than 70.  Yes, of course they do, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so bright.</p>
<p>LOL!  I&rsquo;m ready now for the next propaganda piece, because that one fooled me completely into believing it&rsquo;s absurd claims.</p>
<p>As the crooked politician said, &#8220;Tell me what you want to prove, and I&rsquo;ll get a study done verifying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stereotypes persist because they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>Foreign born blacks have two advantages over American born blacks. First, they don&rsquo;t carry American black baggage of victimization and second, they&rsquo;re grateful to leave the reality of Africa behind. They know an America education is their ONE-WAY ticket out of mother Africa. While American blacks love to fantasize about &#8216;the homeland&rsquo;, African blacks know the reality and want nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Besides, we all know they&rsquo;re a safe middle ground for universities to use to get their black numbers up and flaunt their PC credentials. Foreign borns are also less likely to cause trouble than the natives.<br>

			<p>Of what possible use can these people be? Even if they do graduate from &#8216;college&rsquo; they tend to major in &#8220;African American Studies&#8221; and various other race fluff programs. HELL!!! they are only fit to work for the U.S. Government:)</p>

			<p>This from the &#8220;City of Brotherly Love&#8221; where immigrants blacks get beaten up by the locals for &#8220;actin&rsquo; white&#8221;. Remember always look upon hard work with all due suspicion my brothers. Can you dig it?</p>

			<p>Ironically, quite a few of the AA slots, particularly at elite  colleges, go to West Indian and African Blacks whose ancestors never experienced discrimmination in the United States.  Admission committees don&rsquo;t really care about racism or disadvantage.  They only care about raw numbers which they typically link on their homepage.</p>

			<p>With luck, these africans will return to their homeland and use their education to inprove living condictions there. They will be so greatful for this opportunity that they will alway be loyal friends to the Americans.<br>
   Stop laughing!</p>

			<p>The offspring of post-1965 carribeans,nigerians and ghanians are entitled to aoff the civil rights and affirmtive action godies that were set aside for the american blacks.They are making the same demands on Native Born White Americnas that american blacks have made on Native Born White Americans. As a consequnce, Native Born White Americans will have even greater difficulty having access to the scarce resources-becomming scarcer by the day- of America. These post-1965 blacks have already started given the evil whitey lecture to Natice Born White Americans. A few months back at a Boston area college, the offspring of post-1965 africans, impersonated a whte racist on the school website&hellip;and was praised by the adminstration for her cleverness in making a statement about &#8220;white racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only reason this a nonesense continues day-in and day-out is because ther are not enough Naitive Born White Americans fighting back. So things are going to have to get a hell of a lot worse before the WHITE REVOLT begins. The longer Native Born White Americans wait, the tighter the noose around their neck.</p>
<p>The only game in town is a race based political movement. Salier&rsquo;s citizenship and the free-market- aracial Ron Paulism over at Taki magazine is a death sentetnce for Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Hopefully the economy will continue to implode and hopefully there will be a terrible drought in the American South this summer. Hopefully events will conspire to maximize the pain and suffering of Native Born White Americans. There is no other way.</p>
<p>America is a joke nation.</p>

			<p>How do they define immigrant? If you are born in the USA, you&rsquo;re not an immigrant?</p>

			<p>Consider this for a second, Zimbabwe is a country of 12 million but only has an average IQ of 66*. This still means that around 50,000 Zimbabweans have an IQ higher than 115. The same goes for the rest of the non-Chinese third world, hundreds of millions in Brazil, India, Africa, Middle East have IQs above 100.</p>
<p>*Yes the African IQ is 70. Not only have hundreds of IQ tests done collected by Lynn and Vanhanen confirmed this but so have IQ tests done by African psychologists testing black children against white children attending the same schools and receiving the same nutrition etc.</p>
