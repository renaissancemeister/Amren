<h1>America&rsquo;s New Vogue for Black Fashion Is All Due to Michelle Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Harris, The Guardian (Manchester), April 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is a sign of a quiet revolution in an industry where image is everything: for the past three months the fashion bible Vogue has put a black woman on its cover in America.</p>
<p>The move has sent ripples though the fashion industry, which many have long regarded as discriminating against black models in favour of an aesthetic idealising a very Caucasian image of beauty.</p>
<p>But no longer. The great moment came in March when America&rsquo;s first black first lady, Michelle Obama, stared from the cover of Vogue. She was followed in April by the singer Beyoncé. Now, in May, it&rsquo;s the turn of black model Liya Kebede.</p>
<p>The covers have been hailed by some as the moment fashion finally came to terms with its less than stellar record in celebrating non-white models. It has been mirrored by a greater visibility of black models on the runways of fashion shows and a new fetish for Africa that is sweeping through many design houses. &#8220;Fashion, and Vogue, are celebrating diversity,&#8221; said Edward Enninful, a top stylist and fashion director who works closely with the magazine.</p>
<p>But the impetus for the changing attitudes could lie a long way from the world of haute couture and its powerful designers. The key is Michelle Obama. There is little doubt that she is the biggest political icon to hit the fashion industry since Jackie Onassis. Her face stares from magazine covers, her favoured designers become overnight sensations and the clothes she wears often sell out in the shops as soon as she is seen in them. Some have complained at the triviality of the phenomenon, saying that as America faces the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, that the media focus on Michelle&rsquo;s newest dress is trivial at best and irresponsible at worst.</p>
<p>But that ignores the real powers of fashion. Fashion houses and their models can influence the way millions of Americans think, act and feel about themselves. That can be for ill  &mdash;  with the modern obsession with thinness. Or it can be for good  &mdash;  in the shape of Michelle. A black woman  &mdash;  and also a well-built, professional, educated, older woman  &mdash;  is staring out from the magazine stands and asking Americans to be like her.</p>
<p>It was a debate that raged across the newspapers and blogosphere in the early days of the Obama presidency, sparking furious arguments and pithy headlines on both sides. The source of all this acrimony? Not climate change, not healthcare and not Afghanistan or Iraq. No, for many people the real hot topic of conversation in the wake of Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration was Michelle&rsquo;s predilection for baring her arms.</p>
<p>There is no exaggerating the fascination that the American media have with her. Her clothing choices fuel endless segments on cable news and countless column inches in print and online. An entire website, Mrs O, has been set up to catalogue every fashion move that Michelle makes. When she chose a dress from Jason Wu to be her inaugural gown, it catapulted the designer to overnight success. Wu had set up his label only in 2006; now he is one of the hottest names in the fashion world. That in turn is revealing a new economic power in fashion for black people (after all, the colour that never goes out of style is the green of a dollar bill). &#8220;Michelle Obama and her daughters are forcing advertisers to have a new interest in black beauty,&#8221; said Qianna Smith, fashion editor at Essence magazine.</p>
<p>Everyone is obsessed. &#8220;She has got an innate sense of how she wants to look. It goes beyond clothes. Jackie O had it. Princess Di had it. Michelle Obama has it,&#8221; said Enninful. It probably helps that Laura Bush  &mdash;  who had Michelle&rsquo;s job for the past eight years  &mdash;  definitely did not have it. Though Laura Bush remained popular, even as her husband plumbed the depths of national disdain, she was never adopted by the fashion industry. She wore variations on the same homespun fashions for most of the decade.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama has been very different. Though it would have been easy to play it safe, she has made a conscious decision to make fashion statements. They are not radical. She favours black and keeps her chosen designs classic, but they are nonetheless statements. &#8220;I admire it a great deal. She has an endless sense of style. Has anyone made an impact so quickly as she has? The Obamas have not been in office for 100 days yet. Imagine what it might be like after four, or even eight, years,&#8221; said Tai Beauchamp, a fashion expert and a former deputy editor at Vibe Vixen magazine.</p>
<p>Indeed. But what is truly remarkable about Michelle&rsquo;s emergence as the epitome of American grace, style and fashion is that it was not so long ago that Middle America was supposed to be terrified of her. In 2008, as her husband and Hillary Clinton battled for the Democratic nomination, Michelle was often seen as a potential weak spot. Vicious internet rumours swirled around her political opinions. She was portrayed by critics as a pushy and fire-breathing radical. One especially vicious and untrue rumour  &mdash;  one that prompted direct questions to the Obama campaign  &mdash;  suggested she had used the word &#8220;whitey&#8221; at a conference in Chicago. But that was then and this is now. Michelle Obama has safely transformed her image from potential radical to America&rsquo;s homecoming queen and the nation&rsquo;s darling. Fashion has played a big role in that. &#8220;The election of a black president, and his wife&rsquo;s enormous popularity, are both part of the same cultural shift. America is changing from a culture of assimilation to a culture of pluralism,&#8221; said BJ Gallagher, a Los Angeles-based sociologist and author.</p>
<p>But Michelle Obama is changing fashion as much as embracing it. Her portrait that stares out of the March issue of Vogue  &mdash;  which was shot by famed photographer Annie Leibowitz  &mdash;  is a revolution. She is tall, middle-aged and has a robust physique. She wears a magenta dress and looks as powerful and confident as a highly-educated lawyer should do. In short, she looks far more like an ordinary American than any half-starved, botox-injected celebrity or model ever could. &#8220;Michelle Obama is exactly the sort of woman that the fashion industry has sought to exclude for 100 years,&#8221; said Amy Larocca, a fashion writer for New York magazine.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that is true. The fashion industry has historically played fast and loose with the sort of colour bar that could not exist in other industries. Bar a handful of top names, there are few black models on the runways of the fashion world. Nor, historically, have they been much more than tokens on magazine covers or fashion shoots. In 2007 top designer Stefano Pilati complained to a Washington Post fashion reporter (who was black) that he could not find black models that had the right body proportions and so did not design clothes for a black body shape. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t find [black models] that are beautiful and with the right proportions,&#8221; he said. What was even more shocking was the fact that the comments were buried near the bottom of the resulting piece and they elicited little in the way of outrage. &#8220;Can you imagine another industry that does that? A novelist saying he does not write books for black readers? Or a director saying he does not make a film for a black audience?&#8221; asked Larocca.</p>
<p>The fact is  &mdash;  no matter what the current popularity of Michelle  &mdash;  there are still comparatively few black faces in fashion, especially among models. Just ask Bethann Hardison, a black former model who has become the leading voice for change in the industry: &#8220;I am sure all these fashion designers voted for Obama but they still have a lily-white roster of models,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She welcomed the role that Michelle was playing but felt the proof would be seen on the catwalks. Only when the models sashaying down the runways were a genuine mix of races would the &#8220;Obama revolution&#8221; really have taken off in fashion. &#8220;Talk to me in two years. We&rsquo;ll see what happens when the dust settles down,&#8221; she said.</p>

No mention of newsstand sales numbers. Up? Down? Unchanged?</p>
<p>Is Vogue now committed to having black cover models? What happens when they break the streak? Will they be accused of reverting to old habits?</p>
<p>Vogue may have set themselves up for unsustainable expectations.</p>
<p>Will Vogue thrive or suffer in the long run? Time will tell.</p>
<p>Now if Jet, Essence, Ebony, Source, Vibe et al start putting whites on their covers, we will have reached equality.<br>

			<p>I find all this amusing. All these outfits are digging themselves into a hole over this poor woman. I wonder what all these people are going to say, once Michelle finally has her inevitable meltdown, however it will manifest itself. She is not wrapped too tight and could explode at any minute.</p>

			<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know if Michelle Obama&rsquo;s heavy Miss Black America fantasy is really something we should get all hot and bothered about. </p>
<p>Think of all the damage she could do if she were to actually develop an interest in something important, like exposing the double vectors of sexist &amp; racist oppression experienced by every Black womyn, or the environmental racism that makes Black life an ecological, contaminated hell.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a former First lady who wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead posing in a slinky, clinging dress, slouched over a sofa arm.</p>
<p>You may remember her.</p>
<p>Does Hillary Rodham Clinton jog anyone&rsquo;s memory?</p>

<p>If this is not an example of anti-White msm bias, I don&rsquo;t know what is.  Why would I want to buy a magazine that promotes people who &#8216;don&rsquo;t look like me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hope this drives Vogue out of business.</p>
<p>Newsmax reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For years, the press excoriated Nancy Reagan for borrowing clothes and jewelry from designers.  Yet Michelle Obama has been doing the same thing without an outcry from the press.  Accountants say that the first lady&rsquo;s practice of borrowing both clothing and jewelry raises major tax and disclosure issues, not to mention ethical questions..&#8221;</p>
<p>Did the fashion industry sense that they were about to become a victim of obama&rsquo;s Chicago-style policies?</p>

<p>The American Media - exactly. Nobody else is fawning like this. The absurdity of hyping this average looking black woman as some new pinnacle of beauty and grace is incredible. Black women and white women are apples and oranges. Miss America nearly ran itself into the ground three or four years ago by crowning a black winner every other year. Since the public started being allowed to participate in voting I don&rsquo;t think there has been a black Miss America. (Miss USA is different - they&rsquo;re comparatively new whereas Miss America had a sixty year tradition and almost folded.)</p>

			<p>Also, this is not black fashion. It is a black woman wearing Western fashion in the few colors that work with black skin. Black fashion would be baggy shoplifting outfits or African tribal garb. </p>

			<p> All hail Her Majesty, Queen Michelle! It&rsquo;s obvious that the writer of this puff piece is a starry-eyed liberal who worships the ground the Anointed One and his Anointed Two walk on. Notice how the statement that fashion has &#8220;a lily-white roster of models&#8221; is accepted as accomplished fact, without any proof being offered. And if the bleeding hearts think it&rsquo;s so wonderful that blacks now appear on the cover of Vogue each month, what about Asians, and mestizos, and Native Americans?  </p>

			<p>This should be good for the environment.  Every year thousands of acres of trees are clear cut to provide pulp for the premium grade paper used by those telephone book sized fashion magazines (no recycled paper for them).  I suspect that readership will steadily decline if Vogue keeps putting blacks on the cover (what white woman <i>really</i> wants to look like them?) and that will save a lot of trees.</p>

			<p>I was in Brussels during Easter week.  The Obamas were also in Europe at that time.  All the news stands were plastered with pictures of  the wonderful, marvellous, good-looking Obama family. They are all fawning on the Obamas (as a welcome change from Bush).</p>
<p>The big French magazine, Paris Match, featured Michelle Obama on its cover for at least two issues in a row. Gala magzaine too. You would think Michelle Obama is the (black) reincarnation of Jackie Kennedy   &mdash;   the new world  arbiter of  international taste and elegance.  Even Carla Sarkozy (a former high-fashion model) took second place to Michelle.  Amazing.</p>

			<p><i>The covers have been hailed by some as the moment fashion finally came to terms with its less than stellar record in celebrating non-white models.</i></p>
<p>No, what is less than stellar is the fact that articles like this from the MSM (and that includes the UK) don&rsquo;t even bother to ask why whites should <i>not</i> prefer to see models of their own race, and if that is the case, why magazines should not cater to their primary audience. It isn&rsquo;t even considered. It is simply assumed that it is &#8220;wrong&#8221; somehow, without ever asking &#8220;why.&#8221; The sign of total mind control. Alternative viewpoints are not even worth considering.</p>

<p>Since the public has been allowed to cast an individual vote for Miss America starting in 2002, there has been two Black Miss Americas, Erica Harold, Miss Ameirca 2003 and Erica Dunlap, Miss America 2004. There have also been two Black first runner ups, Miss Texas in 2007 and this past year, Miss Georgia.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the public is very much willing to select Black contestants. There was an Asian Winner one year, Miss Hawaii, Angela Perez Baraquia, Miss America 2001.</p>
<p>In fact, the most former recent Miss USA was Black. There have also been a number of Latino and Black winners in the pageant.  </p>

			<p>The counterpart to a false accusation is, false praise.</p>
<p>So, we have the false accusation of White Guilt, with the false praise of Black Innocence.  We have the false accusation as seen in commercials of White incompetence, with the false praise of Black competence and even exceptionalism.<br>
It is very interesting that in psychology professionals have observed that when immature people who developed an unhealthy attachment to something or someone they once praised will not be able to seperate from that person or thing properly. Instead they merely, and unimaginatively, turn them into their degraded opposite.  I think this is what we are witnessing here.<br>
But there is no reason why we should believe them.  None at all.</p>

<p>I was under the impression public voting was introduced into Miss America when they moved to Vegas from Atlantic City (&#8216;05 or &#8216;06?). I just know that when the pagaent was on the brink of folding they made changes and there has not been a black winner since. The back-to-back black winners you refer to may well have been the near-death blow. Of course, the judges will continue to give black contestants absurdly high scores to get them into the finals but I hope Miss America has gotten the message that all the black winners will kill their enterprise.</p>
<p>I was aware of the black Miss USA winner last year. I am not familiar with their voting process but with the Perez Hilton-Miss California flap this year, it is obvious the judges do not represent mainstream tastes.</p>

<p>As for Michelle, who is now being praised for  exactly that, I don&rsquo;t know what percentage of whiteness she has in her, probably not a preponderance, but if you went to Africa you would see what real &#8220;blacks&#8221; are. She may be tan or even brown, but she sure isn&rsquo;t black.  Maybe by American standards she is considered black, but stand her next to a real African and you&rsquo;ll see the difference.</p>
<p>Oh, and like other &#8220;black&#8221; celebrities, she seems to be getting lighter all the time. Several of the recent pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of her (actually them) make them both look almost white!  Well, the features can&rsquo;t be changed, but the skin shade can.</p>
<p>Anyway, she isn&rsquo;t really being praised for her intelligence, beauty, or accomplishments, but (let&rsquo;s be frank!) only because she&rsquo;s married to the president of the USA.</p>

			<p>Now with all due respect, Michelle Obama is <i>physically</i> attractive. I can&rsquo;t even begin to understand the people who say she isn&rsquo;t. Most guys would respond with a &#8220;hell yes!&#8221; if Michelle Obama offered to go out with them, assuming she were younger, single, and we didn&rsquo;t know her political beliefs. I certainly would.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s the rub: her victim-obsessed, race-obsessed, radical left anti-American socialism. The fashion mags publish pictures of string bean-thin women with D-cups and perfect (or air brushed) skin while obsessing inside about society&rsquo;s (and men&rsquo;s) obsession with physical beauty. &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t they love us for the person we are on the inside inside?,&#8221; they cry.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve seen what Michelle Obama looks like on the inside and that&rsquo;s why her outside repulses me.</p>
<p>But seriously guys, knock off the jabs at Michelle Obama&rsquo;s physical looks: it doesn&rsquo;t serve race realists well, and just makes you look silly.</p>

			<p>Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s Dianna Vreeland was editor in chief of Vogue.  She really went in for black models in the magazine and on the covers about every other month.</p>
<p>Circulation went down.  Advertisers complained.  After about 4 years of her black model binge, Dianna Vreeland was fired because of the advertising complaints.  </p>
<p>The advertisers complained not because of the black models, but because no one bought the clothes, shoes, jewelry and make up shown by the black models in Vogue. Vogue advertising costs a fortune and the advertisers weren&rsquo;t getting their costs back, let alone a profit from their advertising.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed.  Ms. Obama always looks the same on the magazine covers.  Same hairstyle, same sleeveless sheath dress in different colors.  She&rsquo;s not a model.  She&rsquo;s a person. She wears what is good for her age and status as first lady. She looks very nice.  Basically she has probably worn the same hair and type of clothes since she finished school.</p>
<p>But women don&rsquo;t buy fashion magazines to look at the same woman in the same dress and hair every week.  We buy magazines to see something different.  We&rsquo;ve seen enough of her basic classic page boy hair and sleeveless sheaths.</p>
<p>Those sleeveless sheaths are classics and attractive, but they have been around since about 1955 in different skirt lengths.</p>
<p>The beautiful Bush daughters, tall and thin enough to be professional models with beautiful faces and hair were featured just once in 8 years on a fashion magazine cover.</p>
<p>Discrimination anyone?</p>

<p>I agree and I am a radical, radical white nationalist.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a good looking woman.  Nice face, nice hair, great legs.<br>
And her inaugreal outfits did not look like old bedspreads.<br>

<p>What pictures have you been looking at? Every picture that I have seen of the Obama&rsquo;s makes it clear that they are Black. They are indeed an attractive Black family, but no one with adequate eyesight or any reasonable level of sanity would mistake them for White! </p>
<p>Some of you posters are letting your own emotions get the best of you in regards to the Obama&rsquo;s and as Alan has stated, you are beginning to look foolish in the process.</p>
<p>Give it a rest.</p>

<p>I would argue that Michelle Obama is attractive. Would I date or marry her? No. I believe in dating or marrying within my own race, but I think that anyone who thinks she is ugly is either blind or irrational.</p>
<p>Some of the comments of our posters actually give our opponents ammunition</p>

			<p>Civilized Neighbor, what makes anyone think that &#8220;public voting&#8221; for something like &#8220;Miss America&#8221; is honest or real? The people running the show can dictate any outcome they like. They&rsquo;ll throw whites a bone here and there, but the media&rsquo;s agenda is to ram non-whites down everyone&rsquo;s throats. </p>

<p>If she was so stunning and fashionable, then why didn&rsquo;t the fashion industry notice her BEFORE her husband was elected to the presidency?<br>

			<p>As a woman I am offended by any man who goes after a woman&rsquo;s phyiscal traits regardelss of race. </p>
<p>Remember Donald Trump and Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell. Trump lost a lost of respect from a lot of people when he did went after Ms.O&rsquo;Donnell the way he did, especially with women.</p>
<p>I believe Michelle Obama to be an attractive woman and I am White. Some of you posters are doing the movement real damage and alienating women by posting such mean spirited, outlandish rhetoric.  </p>

<p>The fashion mag industry has long been a purveyor of left-wing politics. The women (and I suppose a few men) who read what&rsquo;s inside are looking for what&rsquo;s &#8220;in fashion,&#8221; after all, and that includes political views. Politics is never, never, ever about what makes sense or what&rsquo;s rational. If it was then political views wouldn&rsquo;t change so much. You have to be confident and unapologetic about what you believe in, and defend your views but without excuses. Make your views sound like they&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Re Bush&rsquo;s daughters: they&rsquo;re pretty by any normal standard (i.e., they&rsquo;re never going to be Ford Models), but the blonde one looks disturbingly like her dad, but with boobs. Ewww.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that some of the most successful Vogue covers have been with Black models. Beverly Johnson, the first Black woman to make the cover of Vogue and the first Black supermodel was very financially successful. Another issue with Iman, an somalian model and another supermodel did well as a cover with Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell. In fact there were not many issues with Black models on the cover; however, those that were did very well. </p>

			<p>GHW,</p>
<p>You  say: stand Michelle Obama  next to a &#8220;real African&#8221; and  you will see the  difference.  OK, stand her next to  Jacob Zuma or  Nelson Mandela and she  comes  off  real black.  Stand her next late  wife  of  ex-Nigeria  Head  of  State  and  she  comes off real  black.  Stand her  next  West African soccer  stars who play  in Europe: Didier  Drogba,  Solomon Kalou, Elhaj Diouf and she  comes really black.   Stand  her  next to  all those tall, thin African models  who  parade the  cat walks  of  Euroope  and  she  comes off  &mdash;  well  &mdash;   just  black.  LOL!</p>
<p>The  point  you fail  to recognise GHW is that  most &#8220;black&#8221; people  in Africa are  not literally  black  but  rather  are brownish-yellowish in colour.  Really  dark Africans are  found  mainly in South Sudan and  the  Senegambia  region of  West Africa.</p>
<p>Similarly, &#8220;white&#8221; people are not  really  white(like paper) at  all. They are  rather  pink in colour. Though  there  are  many  olive  coloured  ones  in Southern Europe.</p>

<p>I disagree with you. As both Brit Hume, Shephard Smith and David Schuster mentioned on separate occasions, Michelle Obama has a adiant, elegant look about her. Even some of my girlfriends and I have mentioned the same thing to one another.</p>
<p>It seems that your persoal dislike of Michelle Obama has clouded your judgement, or you may genuinely believe what you say, although I would argue that most rational, objective people would disagree with you.</p>

<p>Then why did overall circulation go way down during the black model binge, why did the advertizers complain and pull their ads and why did the publisher fire Dianna Vreeland?</p>
<p>Because no one bought the clothes modeled by blacks. <br>
