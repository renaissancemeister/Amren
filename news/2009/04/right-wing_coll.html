<h1>Right-Wing College Group Riles Students on Campuses Nationwide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joshua Rhett Miller, FOX News, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A student group that bills itself as &#8220;America&rsquo;s right wing youth movement&#8221; focused on countering radical multiculturism, socialism and mass immigration is causing a stir on a growing number of college campuses across the country.</p>
<p>The conservative political group Youth for Western Civilization is currently organized on at least seven university campuses. According to its Web site, the group hopes to inspire Western youth on the &#8220;basis of pride in their American and Western heritage,&#8221; counter and ultimately defeat &#8220;leftism on campus&#8221; and create a social movement in which a right-wing subculture is an alternative to what it calls a &#8220;poisonous and bigoted&#8221; campus climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;A great part of college is definitely meeting people of different backgrounds, but a multicultural ideology teaches that we should appreciate things just because they&rsquo;re different from our culture with no regards to the quality of the culture and that all cultures are inherently equal,&#8221; said Trevor Williams, president of YWC&rsquo;s Vanderbilt chapter. &#8220;I absolutely disagree.&#8221;</p>
<p>But students who lean left are not welcoming their new neighbor. Those opposed to YWC say its message teeters on hate speech and has no place at institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Western&rsquo; is a veiled term that means &#8216;white,&rsquo;&#8221; University of North Carolina graduate student Tyler Oakley wrote in an e-mail to FOXNews.com. &#8220;I believe that our democracy is strong enough to allow extreme forms of speech, but YWC&rsquo;s message is essentially a negative one, an assault on not being white or non-Western, and is therefore hateful, if not blatant hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which identifies and tracks hate groups in the U.S., told FOXNews.com that the YWC is not currently on its list, but some of the group&rsquo;s views are &#8220;suspect,&#8221; including the notion that Western civilization is somehow superior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re definitely monitoring them,&#8221; said SPLC spokewoman Heidi Beirich. &#8220;We will look at them for hate group status.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group will sponsor another speech by Tancredo on Wednesday just off campus from Providence College, where school officials recently denied a request from the still unsanctioned group to host the former congressman, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party&rsquo;s presidential nomination in 2008.</p>
<p>Tim Dionisopoulos, president of YWC&rsquo;s unofficial Providence chapter, said Tancredo plans to speak &#8220;right in front of the gates&#8221; at the 4,000-student university and to head to a Veterans for Foreign War event. Providence officials say YWC has not sought formal recognition as a student group and thus cannot host an event at the Rhode Island college. But Dionisopoulos says the college is hiding behind protocol.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been unfairly targeted,&#8221; the political science major told FOXNews.com. &#8220;The content scares administrators because this is a group that will stand up for what they believe in. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re opposed to our mission statement, I think they&rsquo;re more so afraid of what the opposition will do to us and have done to us elsewhere. Eventually, someone&rsquo;s got to come out and say this has got to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesse Jones, a freshman at Vanderbilt, where YWC hosted former U.S. Treasurer Bay Buchanan last month, acknowledged the group&rsquo;s right to organize and share its views.</p>
<p>&#8220;But their fascist-like logo, their name echoing &#8216;Hitler Youth,&rsquo; and Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s call of &#8216;this is your country  &mdash;  take it back&rsquo; all quite frankly scare me,&#8221; Jones wrote in an e-mail to FOXNews.com.</p>
<p>Jones said he&rsquo;s also disturbed by the group&rsquo;s call to restore a &#8220;curriculum that focuses on Western history, not political correctness,&#8221; according to its Web site.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to change the curriculum to emphasize &#8216;classical learning&rsquo; and get rid of &#8216;trendy multiculturalism,&rsquo;&#8221; Jones continued. &#8220;In practice this means firing professors with the wrong views and hiring those with the &#8216;right&rsquo; views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even assuming there is a &#8216;right&rsquo; view on a given issue, the point is to get students to come to this opinion on their own, given the facts. In this way, YWC&rsquo;s views on education are inherently anti-intellectual.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is correct. The left has been attacking &#8216;Western Civilization&rsquo; for nearly 40 years now and it is obvious that their attacks are motivated by racial hostility toward whites. Is Travis Oakley involved in some capacity in a far-left campus political group? I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Is that group on the $PLC hate group list for anti-white ideology? Not a chance.</p>

<p>They have been pronounced guilty. Now all the splc has to do lay in wait and &#8216;monitor&rsquo; them for &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>I wonder if this might be an ADL, SPLC AJC front group.  ADL, SPLC, AJC are always setting up evil White groups like those so called neo nazis in Idaho so they can raise funds and Tim Wise can call for the extermination of whites.</p>
<p>The ADL, SPLC, AJC operatives undercover within the group commit some sort of alleged hate crime .  Then the publicity campaign begins.</p>
<p>The Randy Weaver episode was the result of a several years long set up by US government agencies such at ATF and FBI with a lot of help from ADl SPLC AJC operatives.  In fact, that so called neo-nazi crew the ATF wanted Randy to join as a government informant was an ADL SPLC front.</p>
<p>I first learned of this kind of ADL SPLC AJC tactic when my uncle retired from the FBI.  He was in DC in the late 1960&rsquo;s when George Lincoln Rockwell founded his American Nazi party and was assassinated.</p>
<p>According to my uncle, a 25 year FBI agent, Rockwell and his organization was merely a front group for fund raising for a certain tiny middle eastern country and its powerful lobby here in America.</p>
<p>I have followed stories of so called neo nazi groups over the years.  They always consist of 4 guys, 3 of whom live in the local home for developmentally disabled adults.  But the ADL SPLC AJC gets millions in donations from &#8220;exposing&#8221; these groups.</p>
<p>That is the major reason I have never joined any group to fight for the restoration of 14th amendment rights to whites.  Who knows who and what is really behind any group? I assume the ADL SPLC wants to discover and target Whites who are racially aware by founding White nationalist groups.</p>
<p>You can bet that campus feminists will claim not rape, but &#8220;sexual harassement&#8221; by this group.  Every racist non white will be starting fights and making false accusations. The colleges will jump in to destroy the whites, just as Duke University jumped to destroy the Lacrosse players.</p>
<p>If this group is real, wonderful.  I hope it is not taken over by some ADL SPLC operatives.</p>

			<p>I remember reading about Jesse Jackson leading this march way back about 35-40 years ago, the chant was, &#8220;Hey hey, ho ho, western culture&rsquo;s gotta go.&#8221;  Something like that.</p>
<p>This is going to be a David vs. Goliath battle.  Consider that when people think of colleges, they think of hotbeds of liberalism.</p>

<p>Notice the bipolar nature of these people&rsquo;s views. If you&rsquo;re pro-multiculturalism you&rsquo;re full of &#8220;love&#8221; I guess, but if you&rsquo;re not, you must be &#8220;hateful&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;  There is no in-between.  You don&rsquo;t need to be sporting nazi armbands. If you don&rsquo;t agree with their point of view, then you are by definition &#8220;hateful.&#8221; Nice to own all the definitions of all the words, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Even assuming there is a &lsquo;right&rsquo; view on a given issue, the point is to get students to come to this opinion on their own, given the facts. In this way, YWC&rsquo;s views on education are inherently anti-intellectual.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>BUT, look at this:</p>
<p><i>Those opposed to YWC say its message teeters on hate speech and has no place at institutions of higher learning.</i></p>
<p>Wow, &#8220;has no place at institutions of higher learning?&#8221; What happened to&#8221;students should come to opinions on their own?&#8221; So much for that. We shall decide for them what is &#8220;hateful&#8221; and what is not.</p>

<p>The YWC needs encouragemnt, not curious stares!  The members are onto what is wrong with the education system in the western world.<br>
I don&rsquo;t care what blacks say about anything racist. They are intellectually mediocre, and we continue to scare the hell out of them.  Of course blacks want this SO-called &#8220;hate group&#8221; eliminated!  They have hidden inside of the nation&rsquo;s most powerfully racist hate group  &mdash;  the NAACP  &mdash;  for years. I know this;  I was a member for seven years&hellip;</p>
<p>At last, we see a group of young Amereican-Americans whose charter it is to protect our past and ensure our future.  If the YWC needs funding, every supporter of this site should dig deep for them.  I know that I am going to do so with a great deal of American-American pride.  The energy of the young will pull us through this nightmare.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it wierd how people will move into a neighborhood because it is a great neighborhood, then turn around and want to completely change the neighborhood, or otherwise do things that destroy the neighborhood? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. These kids are trying to bring back their old neighborhood, and I don&rsquo;t blame them - I hope they are the start of something successful. </p>

			<p>And look at the great statements that are actually being reported now in mainstream media:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;a multicultural ideology teaches that we should appreciate things just because they&rsquo;re different from our culture with no regards to the quality of the culture and that all cultures are inherently equal&hellip;I absolutely disagree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;administrators&hellip;(are) afraid of what the opposition will do to us and have done to us elsewhere. Eventually, someone&rsquo;s got to come out and say this has got to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Anonymous at 7:39 PM on April 29:</p>
<p>This group feels real to me. And it&rsquo;s not located in some isolated compound, it&rsquo;s in the heart of one of the country&rsquo;s most important sectors, academia. It will be a lot harder to extirpate.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ideas are ideas whose time has come. So even if it is subverted, I expect it would be re-organized, or other groups take its place.</p>
<p>The gov&rsquo;t managed to subvert parts of the new left movement back in &#8220;the 60s&#8221;, but it couldn&rsquo;t block the overwhelming force of the entire movement.</p>

<p>You can see their logo here.  It doesn&rsquo;t look any more fascist than any other random logo.  Not a swastika or SS lightning bolt in sight.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just assume for the sake of argument that &#8220;Youth for Western Civilization&#8221; is just code for &#8220;Youth for White People&#8221;.  So what?  Universities have innumerable pro-Hispanic and pro-black groups, and they never get called hate groups.  But have just <i>one</i> pro-white group, and the sky comes falling down.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if they&rsquo;re now being &#8220;monitored&#8221; by the SPLC they must be doing something right.  The SPLC hates us, they hate the Minutemen, they hate Tom Tancredo, and they hate the very mainstream Federation for American Immigration Reform.  They are the country&rsquo;s best funded hate group.</p>

<p>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDIN&rsquo; ME, How pathetic is that? kids who jump rope without the rope? What is the world coming to? I have to admit that sounds like real do gooder left wing insanity to me. This type of mentality will turn white people into real wimps!! When my father was young kids played sports for fun and boys got into the occasional fight without trying to sue someone in court. Nowadays all the kids do is watch left wing TV and play video games. That is why we have so many fat little layabouts in America who don&rsquo;t know how to socialize with other children. What happened to the days when men behaved like men?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m against their mission statement. You don&rsquo;t come out &#8216;against&rsquo; something, you come out for something. Only &#8216;minority&rsquo; groups get away with that. If I have him right by what he says here&hellip; all he can muster up is the courage to say that the whole point YWC is to be a punching for the leftists and faculty on campus? God help us all. Playing the victim doesn&rsquo;t work when you are white. Leftists will celebrate driving YWC off campus, not feel guilty about it.</p>
<p>You have to play the game though. There are whites who are victims in our society, often - usually, at the hands of non-whites or their white enablers. All whites aren&rsquo;t &#8216;privileged&rsquo;. Even at the nations top universities. Universities in particular offer unfair admission, a curriculum that is proud to be hateful, only to whites, and they call for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in the form of even greater participation for non-white special interest groups on campus while none at all exist for white students. </p>

They&rsquo;ve demonized white power to such a degree that&rsquo;s about the only kind of person who would join. I&rsquo;m sure there are no shortage of volunteers willing to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Once they control the opposition too. Let&rsquo;s face it, the control is total.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re more right than you know.  About ten years ago, there was a Ph.D. thesis written by a graduate student at George Mason University, mainly about the Southern Poverty Law Center.  He proved that there is a symbiotic relationship between Federal law enforcement and the SPLC.  He pointed out that the former use the latter for spying and voyeuristic functions prohibited to themselves b/c of privacy rights. </p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t explain how the FBI pays back the SPLC, but it&rsquo;s obvious:  By having its agents and/or &#8220;informants&#8221; (read: provocateurs) dress up in funny uniforms and funny symbols so that an SPLC videog/photog can be right there to take photos, run them in the next issue of the &#8220;Intelligence Report,&#8221; and use that as the pretense of all the &#8220;right-wing extremism&#8221; out there such that you had to give the SPLC money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just my common sense, it is now proven fact.  In the summer of last year, it was found out that a Tampa-area &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; group was formed and run by an FBI agent.</p>
<p>YWC seems real to me.  The reason I think they&rsquo;re above board is that they don&rsquo;t embrace any outrageous symbols and language.</p>

			<p><i>Is that group on the $PLC hate group list for anti-white ideology? Not a chance.</i></p>
<p>The SPLC actually does include one or two anti-white hate groups on its list as cover for pretending to be against all hate. It goes without saying that it is far more lenient on black, hispanic, asian and jewish ethnocentrism than on the white kind.<br>

<p>That event was relatively recent. It took place during the late 80s at Stanford, when Jackson and company were protesting core requirements involving a modest exposure to Western civilization. More than one poster from or at Stanford on these boards has demonstrated what a thorough triumph the campaign was, as these &#8220;antis&#8221; are completely innocent of any knowledge of Western Civ.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Western&#8221; is not a veiled term that means &#8220;White&#8221;.  It is an out-in-the-open reference to the fact of history that Western Culture IS White Culture.  Our people founded it, developed it, fought for it. </p>
<p>The Leftists can try to redefine terms and rewrite history to their heart&rsquo;s content, but that will never change the facts.  And all their blustering and opposition combined will never change the fact that we have a natural right to take pride in our culture and people, to pool our efforts for the advancement of both, and to fight for their continued existence.</p>
<p>Never let their posturing and attacks on terminology distract you from their true purpose, folks.  The Left is intent upon dismantling your nation, culture, and traditions, and handing control of these priceless commodities over to other peoples.  If doing so requires your own people to vanish from the pages of history, it&rsquo;s a price they are more than happy to pay.<br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an email sent to the YWC newspaper, The Hammer, by an irate leftist:</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch your backs YWC - your rhetoric has people itching for a fight - people who have no delusions about your self serving and hypocritical cries for free speech - and people who have no allegience to pacifism as the means to dealing with your threat. You better be prepared to bleed for Tom Tancredo and Bay Buchanan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leftist groups are accustomed to being at least mildly physical in their protests against persons (e.g. the physical removal of Jared Taylor from the hall he was going to speak at in Nova Scotia), and encountering no resistance.</p>
<p>If there are physical attacks on the YWC, such attacks may issue a more visceral call to feelings of racial identity of white athletes and other whites on campuses than the calls we&rsquo;ve been able to issue.</p>
<p>If administrations refuse to protect the YWC&rsquo;s functions, that will be a vivid illustration to campus whites of the hypocrisy that controls white&rsquo;s open expression.</p>
<p>If administrations do protect the YWC&rsquo;s functions, there will finally be an open voice speaking the heretofore unspeakable, and thus legitimizing those &#8220;unspeakable&#8221; views in people&rsquo;s minds (that&rsquo;s more the way that views are changed for the masses, rather than by pure reason).</p>
<p>It all seems good to me. I&rsquo;m very excited by the YWC!</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t you guys get it?  They can&rsquo;t say they are white because they wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to organize openly on campus.  All student organizations these days are required to have non-discrimination agreements.  These guys are getting absolutely hammered.  They are openly challenging multiculturalism.  They don&rsquo;t need criticisms or even good wishes.  They need real support.</p>
<p>If you are a white nationalist, a racial realist, or even someone committed to just basic fairness for whites, I think they deserve our support.  </p>
<p>I just donated.  <a href="http://westernyouth.org/Donate/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://westernyouth.org/Donate/index.htm</a></p>

			<p>As Daniel Webster stated,&#8221;Hold on, my friends to the Constitution and to the Republic for which it stands. Miracles DO NOT CLUSTER, and what has happened once in 6000 years, may not happen again. Hold on to the Constitution for if the American Constitution should fail, there will be anarchy throughout the world.&#8221; We are seeing the growth of anarchy, now, all over the world. If this group and others like them do not succeed, not only will America fall into oblivion, but the entire world will return to chaos. In nature chaos always precedes order. America has been the order in the world for many years, and it has been the ultimate order. But, like a fallen tree which over time, decays and eventually returns to the earth, America will fall, unless blessed again with strong leadership, strong morality, and a love of western civilization. God bless these children and give them strength. They are the only hope we have of avoiding the ultimate chaos.</p>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t have these multiple &#8216;minority&rsquo; special interest groups on campus influencing the curriclum, forming the diversity agenda, and being the live component of the diversity &#8216;debate&rsquo; going on 40 years now and not have white groups involved also. When it comes to the impassioned calls for diversity, let&rsquo;s have some. Any call for diversity that isn&rsquo;t calling for white special interest groups being representing too isn&rsquo;t calling for diversity at all. Diversity doesn&rsquo;t have to mean we all think the same thing.  </p>

			<p>The right-thinking progressive folks would have us believe only minority racial groups deserve to be heard. There are 3 kinds of colleges broken down by racial groups in this country, Majority white colleges, Historically black colleges, and Majority black colleges. The same kind of anti-white mentality is in action at every college in the nation. </p>

			<p>The way to avoid COINTELPRO type ops is to support seemingly worthy groups, but avoid anything that is illegal.  Also, avoid all individuals who talk about illegal things.  Then, even if the group isn&rsquo;t legit, you&rsquo;ll be supporting its legit purposes that will help the cause.  Then, those who don&rsquo;t want patriots to gain any ground and who are setting up phony groups to cause problems will actually be helping the cause.</p>

			<p>Article shows what morons most college students are. Since they have no background in classical literature in high school, nor any deep understanding of European, let alone American history, they believe that the values of Homer, Plato, Aquinas, Augustine, Dante, Descartes, Jefferson,Santayana, Toynbee, C.S.Lewis, Russell Kirk, Richard Weaver, T.S. Eliot and Churchill,  have to be &#8220;proved&#8221; before they are included in the curriculum. </p>
<p>In the meantime, are the thoughts of Karl Marx, Chairman Mao, Ghandi, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe to be given equal weight? Or perhaps the plaigiarized writings of Martin Luther King, one of the greatest failures in American history, as his contemporary Malcolm X, succinctly noted ? </p>
<p>I advise the courageous young people trying to get some semblance of balance back to our PC infected universities to relentlessly point out the foul and corrupt nature of the so-called Southern Poverty Law Center, because those bloodsuckers will smell big bucks in trying to silence free speech on our already socialist and ethnocentric censored campuses.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I remember reading about Jesse Jackson leading this march way back about 35-40 years ago, the chant was, &ldquo;Hey hey, ho ho, western culture&rsquo;s gotta go.&rdquo;That event was relatively recent. It took place during the late 80s at Stanford, when Jackson and company were protesting core requirements involving a modest exposure to Western civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among other things, the Stanford blacks went to the private home of a middle aged Nurse/Administrator at Stanford Hospital and beat her up because Stanford Hospital did not have enough affirmative action black employees to suit the black student organizations.<br>

<p>This is an outrageous and blatant call to violence and for totalitarian suppression of disagreement!  It is completely undemocratic and is everything the USA does not represent.  And yet, it&rsquo;s not surprising at all.  If this came from any right-wing group, there would be shrieks of hysteria from the SPLC. ADL, and all the other anti-white groups;  and the FBI would be right in there investigating the intimidation and  violation of people&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>Of course, if the YWC do organize to defend themselves (something the universities won&rsquo;t effectively do) we can expect to hear more hysterical screams about  &#8220;violent rightist groups&#8221;, neo-nazi thugs, jack-booted fascists, etc.  Blah, blah.    It&rsquo;s all to be expected.  It&rsquo;s all been seen before.   </p>
<p>And it must be said too that the YWC are really very mild!   They have said nothing at all about race, etc., but the merest hint of it (even if imaginary) is enough to set the Bolsheviks and &#8220;antifas&#8221; screaming for their blood  (literally!).</p>
<p>As I have said in another post elsewhere, Bolsheviks and other violent Marxists don&rsquo;t really worry about polite &#8220;conservatives&#8221; who are nothing more than a  mere joke that can easily be brushed aside.    To the extreme Left, their greatest nightmare and terror are &#8220;fascists&#8221; who are willing to defend themselves,  fighting &#8220;fire with fire&#8221;, and who were, historically, the ONLY ones resisting them AND WINNING!</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re more right than you know. About ten years ago, there was a Ph.D. thesis written by a graduate student at George Mason University, mainly about the Southern Poverty Law Center. He proved that there is a symbiotic relationship between Federal law enforcement and the SPLC. He pointed out that the former use the latter for spying and voyeuristic functions prohibited to themselves b/c of privacy rights. &#8220;</p>
<p>Right on.  </p>
<p>The entire several years of stalking, harassement and attempted entrapment of Randy Weaver and then murdering his 14 year old son and wife was a joint operation of FBI, ATF, ADL and SPLC.</p>
<p>Back in 1967 when my uncle was an FBI agent, the FBI exposed the fact that George Lincoln Rockwell&rsquo;s American Nazi Party was a front for the bond salesmen and fundraisers of a tiny little freckle on the face of the earth middle eastern country and its powerful lobby in the United States.</p>
<p>But now I guess even the FBI can&rsquo;t stand up to the neocons. Well that&rsquo;s what a country deserves when it hires unqualified women and minorites to run its premier national law enforcement agency.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The SPLC actually does include one or two anti-white hate groups on its list as cover for pretending to be against all hate. It goes without saying that it is far more lenient on black, hispanic, asian and jewish ethnocentrism than on the white kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, even taking the echo chamber effect into consideration I think the answer would have to be &#8220;yes.&#8221; Polling in Britain suuposedly shows BNP support at 20% or more. It is more and more common to hear people openly voice concern about immigration, and such people no longer bother with the apologies aforehand. And California, which is supposedly the birthplace of all new American trends, is seriously talking about a policy that would tilt UC admissions more towards whites.</p>
<p>Yes, it is starting to smell like a glorious new day.</p>

<p>So true!  When will these people  (the &#8220;nice&#8221; conservatives) ever get the message?  Invariably, we hear their careful disclaimers that they are not &#8220;racists&#8221;.  It is  so standard, they might as well just play a recording or hand out a form letter saying that they condemn all &#8220;racism&#8221; and are not evil &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;.    </p>
<p>That  doesn&rsquo;t matter!   Don&rsquo;t they realize that they are going to be condemned and attacked by the extreme Left  ANYWAY?   Their apologies and disclaimers don&rsquo;t make the slightest bit of difference!  To fanatical Marxists, if they stand up for whites, then they are THE ENEMY.</p>

As usual,if people of European lineage do the exact same thing,they are &#8220;branded&#8221; as racist bigoted haters.I applaud these young people for their courage and I send them E-mails often to support them.They need to know they are not alone and deserve all the help we can give them.God bless them.Now more than ever&hellip;..Teach your children well&hellip;.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;In practice this means firing professors with the wrong views and hiring those with the &lsquo;right&rsquo; views.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is different from the current situation&hellip; how?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even assuming there is a &lsquo;right&rsquo; view on a given issue, the point is to get students to come to this opinion on their own, given the facts. In this way, YWC&rsquo;s views on education are inherently anti-intellectual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones does not seem to live with us in this place called reality. American universities are full of professors pushing diversity, &#8220;tolerance&#8221; (read: submission), and multiculturalism as the &#8216;right&rsquo; view.</p>

			<p>Margaret states that  the new left were the children of FDR&rsquo;s administration,   backed and funded by Moscow  and its agencies in the US.  They may have looked like lunatic-fringe hippies, but they were from some of America&rsquo;s richest families.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly so.   I wish I could the remember the exact quote and where I found it, but I read years ago some historian&rsquo;s observation that there has never been an instance of a successful peasants&rsquo; revolt or any popular uprising that was not aided  (and usually directed) by disaffected  members of the ruling elite.    </p>
<p>This was certainly the case in the American Revolution, which was led almost entirely by  disaffected members of the colonial upper class. It was later the identical case in South America, where the wealthy colonial Creoles chafed  at being socially excluded and barred from power by the haughty &#8220;Peninsulares&#8221; (those born in Spain, for whom the highest positions were exclusively reserved).    Bolivar, O&rsquo; &#8216;Higgins, etc. were all wealthy and high-born colonial aristocrats, just as Washington and Jefferson were, but were looked down upon as backward provincials by their European rulers.  (This snobbery proved very costly to those rulers!) </p>
<p>And this was also very much the case in the French and Russian revolutions, where quite a few aristocrats  (for reasons of their own)  backed the other side.   In fact, Louis XVI&rsquo;s  brother, the Duke of Orleans, sympathized with the revolutionaries, renounced his title and ancestry and even re-named himself Philip Equality (though, ultimately, that did not save him from the guillotine).  Even Chairman Mao was the privileged son of a wealthy landowner&hellip;. exactly as was Fidel Castro in Cuba.   Just look at some of these Indian/Mayan revolts that have been going on in Mexico&hellip; all of them led by white, educated Marxist revolutionaries!   </p>
<p>I have to agree with that historian. I cannot think of any  [successful] uprising of the masses  that has not essentially been  led by alienated, disaffected aristocrats, renegades acting as traitors to their own class.</p>
<p>Like Castro and Mao,  revolutionaries like Bill Ayers already have a great deal of wealth, power, and privilege   &mdash;    but that isn&rsquo;t enough. They want it ALL..     They don&rsquo;t want to be second rank; they want to be in command.  Nothing less will do.</p>

			<p>if you&rsquo;re white you are automatically guilty of being a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and a &ldquo;hater&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s kind of like with original sin in Christianity   &mdash;   no matter what you do, you&rsquo;re still a sinner. <br>

Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought of that too. It&rsquo;s VERY MUCH like original sin.  It&rsquo;s an interesting concept, isn&rsquo;t it?  No matter what you do, if you&rsquo;re white, you&rsquo;re guilty; you were BORN that way!  </p>
<p>All whites were BORN evil and wicked. It&rsquo;s in their nature. Only the balm of Marxism can save them from their innate sinfulness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very encouraged that AR published the above post.  It&rsquo;s definitely one that all should read.  My suspicions are aroused and frustration sets in, when the group in question is ALWAYS listed as &#8220;Right-wing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in fairness to all, most people in the West still think in terms of Ideological, and Theological, categories.  And the most promising subject one could study (in or out of college), which might help us free ourselves from this, is without question, Cultural History.  <br>
But that has suffering from a severe case of Arrested Development thanks to Political Correctness.  </p>
<p>This is a post, so I can&rsquo;t present reasons, only conclusions. <br>
The Right and Left are both 18th Century Enlightenment Ideologies and they do not represent the zenith of Western thought. Romanticism does.  But who knows about that?<br>
Keeping that in mind I will say that I have often thought that the West has been unable to continue to grow Spiritually and Intellectually because it has been too busy defending itself, and it can not do that well because it doesn&rsquo;t have an updated relationship with itself. </p>
<p>This group may be as legitimate as any other Right-leaning group, from Taki.com to Pat Buchanan to VDARE and even AR.  <br>
But, with all respect to those groups, if the West must depend entirely on the Right to defend itself its future can be told with perfect assurance - It&rsquo;s doomed.  And doesn&rsquo;t that seem to be the direction we&rsquo;re headed?  It&rsquo;s my view that a thorough re-evaluation will lead to a genuine, and perhaps lasting, revitalization.  </p>

			<p>The SPLC shows us daily that they are purveyors of racial hatred, using progressive facist techniques to get their anarchist messages out to the kool aid drinkers and the uneducated.  </p>
<p>They feed off of ignorance and brain washing.</p>
<p>The Messiahs regime, led by a stalwart of justice (sarc) like AG Holder needs to look into this group soon. </p>
