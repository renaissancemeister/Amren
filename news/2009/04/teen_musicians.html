<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They showed up with guitars, basses and violins, ready to make music.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The aspiring musician from Mid-Wilshire Education and Career Center joined 50 other youths, ages 14 to 18, from across Los Angeles County on Saturday for the first Anti-Hate Songfest, an event partnering talented teenage poets, rappers and songwriters with award-winning musicians to create music to fight violence, racism and indifference.</p>
<p>The program was organized by the county Commission on Human Relations&rsquo; youth initiative called zerohour: No Haters Here.</p>
<p>Like De La Paz, many of the students said that they have endured discrimination or been tempted by gangs and drugs, but that music has saved them. After a series of educational workshops earlier this year, the students were chosen to come together Saturday at the Los Angeles Music Academy in Pasadena, where they were separated into groups. With help from professional musicians, they wrote more than a dozen songs that will be compiled on a CD. The students will perform in small concerts in coming months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So for nearly six hours, students holed up in closet-sized recording studios with Grammy-nominated and multiplatinum-selling songwriters, stopping only for a quick lunch. They fused hip-hop with folk and alternative, rock with rap and electronica, and ballads with pop, creating lyrics with positive messages of love, friendship and optimism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pepe, an 18-year-old freshman at Pitzer College in Claremont, moved to Southern California from Seattle five months ago. He saw little gang violence growing up in his neighborhood, but he said he understands the influence music has over people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the commission&rsquo;s annual report, hate crimes in the county rose 28% last year, to 763. One-tenth happened in schools. One in three high school students has complained about being harassed because of race, sexual orientation or religion, among other reasons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With help from Lindy Robbins, a songwriter who&rsquo;s worked with &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winners such as Jordin Sparks, and from indie hip-hop musician Chris Devcich, the group completed a song that tells listeners they are not alone with their fears and worries.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t read this in this article, but I bet they&rsquo;re trying to gloss over the black-Hispanic wars in southern California with these &#8220;anti-hate songs.&#8221;  And, they&rsquo;ll get As in Martin Luther Kingology for the best songs.</p>

			<p>One in three high school students complained about being harassed.  Notice how they did not mention who was doing the harassing.  Any white kid in a public school will tell you its the blacks and mexicans that do the harassing, but yet they try to make white people feel guilty.  </p>

			<p>This is typical of young people today. They have no valid  conception of reality beyond their neat little &#8220;MTV/schoolroom/college lecture hall&#8221; experiences. Thus, if only &#8220;Hate&#8221;(that is to say, evil White bigotry)were eradicated, not a problem would exist in the world! Of course the myriad tribal, racial and ethnic wars and squabbles that cover the entire globe and range far outside the realm of any living Caucasoid, are conveniently overlooked. Alas, fighting &#8220;Hate&#8221; makes these children feel good - and that&rsquo;s good enough for them.<br>

			<p>So I&rsquo;m &#8220;racist&#8221; if I find that scruffy scene of violin &#8220;strumming&#8221; and bongo beating mildly nauseating? Or if I don&rsquo;t buy the disingenuous and unbelievable claim that being exposed to other strange religions somehow makes one&rsquo;s own faith &#8220;stronger?&#8221; The idea that all religions are going to exist in perfect peace and harmony in close proximity to each other is a fantasy only Westerners could believe, and certainly not something that Muslims, one of whose central tenets is the extermination of other religions, is ever going to fall for.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re forming a new cultic religion in which the object of worship is themselves, a modern cargo cult where they will be showered with goodies if they devote their study time to magical incantations.</p>
<p>I remember how in college I&rsquo;d put off doing my homework, but unlike these kids I realized the homework was the key to the goodies, not the activities I devised to procrastinate, so I finally did the homework.</p>

<p>It is really too bad the Pied Piper of Hamlin did, also, not show up.  He could have musically piped these people back across the border to share their love, friendship and optimism in old Mexico.  Mexico is their country, and I wish they would get the hell out of mine.         <br>

			<p>Black folks are trained to hate white folks every day, or at least to get in touch with their special &#8216;blackness&rsquo;, the same as the other racial groups in America, except for whites who need reformed, because, the same folks who favor every race but their own, white folks (who can&rsquo;t even speak their race or call them selves whites)&hellip; they&rsquo;re just not deracinated enough. </p>
<p>I guess we need a special day to protest against their bigotry and hatred. </p>

			<p>We have an anti racism music fest in London every year.  It usually ends up as a black on black stabfest.  The annual Notting Hill music fest is worse, and this year at the MOBO  fest at the O2 center in the millenium dome open warfare started within an hour in a half. I had to be cancelled, I love this diversity.</p>

<p>Uh, &#8220;Marco&#8221;, worrying about &#8220;hatred&#8221; is like worrying about &#8220;racism&#8221;  &mdash;  it marks you as a loser, because that&rsquo;s exactly what today&rsquo;s Amerikan &#8220;mainstream&#8221; wants: people like you earnestly believing what you just said</p>
<p>  &mdash;  unless, that is, you&rsquo;re an egalitarian troll on this site. You come here  &mdash;  for the first time as I recall  &mdash;  sounding sympathetic. But your happy-talk echoes that of the very same sanctimonious do-gooders who organized this thing.</p>
<p> I think your preachy post strongly suggests that I and others on this site actually do accept &#8220;hatred&#8221; as indeed a &#8220;realistic way to solve problems&#8221;. In other words, your stuff sounds like an accusation of being a &#8220;hater&#8221;. Maybe you want to rethink what you are suggesting about others on this forum.</p>
<p>By the way, I was unable to find any audio samples from the recording that allegedly came out of this, so I can&rsquo;t give an opinion as a musician. But the lyrics quoted in the article were awesomely bad  &mdash;  just what I would expect from self-important but modestly talented teenagers. Yuck!</p>

<p>Excellent point.  Great post.</p>
<p>Could you imagine a White student naive enough to trust the &#8220;fellow-feeling&#8221; there and share Randolph&rsquo;s legitimate concern about his country being turned into a Banana Republic? </p>
<p>This article is one of the better examples of the Soft Totalitarianism, or Totalitarianism-lite, or Nutra-Sweet Facism (as I like to call it), that&rsquo;s been spreading around the World since the advent of Political Correctness.</p>
<p>Filled to the rim with Phoney Niceness.  </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d only need to confront them something that seriously questions the legitimacy of any one of their outrageous accusations or unrealistic expectations to find out just how phoney they really are.  </p>

<p>Listen buddy all I&rsquo;m saying is that these kids are just kids and even tho I am often irritated by the mentality of blacks and some other minorities, I do not hate them because hate is a very powerful emotion. Yes you are right that these people are do-gooders but they are only kids who will learn the realities of life in due time. Hate is a very strong word my friend and I really don&rsquo;t see how it helps anything. In fact I think it just gives minorities a greater chance of playing the race card against whites, maybe you should think  about that. <br>

<p>My sentiments precisely.  Tell us, Marco, what exactly do you mean by the term &#8220;hatred&#8221;?  In my experiences, it generally tends to be an all-purpose (and equally vague) term used by self-rightious leftists to smear any idea or point of view they don&rsquo;t agree with.  Much like how &#8220;racist&#8221; is used to decry anyone they don&rsquo;t like  &mdash;  and typically can&rsquo;t agrue logically against.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;This is typical of young people today. They have no valid conception of reality beyond their neat little &ldquo;MTV/schoolroom/college lecture hall&rdquo; experiences&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These little play-acting Marxists will get a hard dose of reality when they go to apply for colleges or jobs and find out pronto that no Whites need apply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bitter pill to swallow and the sooner these little brainwashed lefties get this message, the better.</p>
<p>I just went through this with my middle daughter when the college acceptance letters arrived and the kids ranked in the top ten of the class (not percentage, top ten students) were rejected by university after university while NAMs far below in ranking were flown into these same universities and offered full scholarships that include transportation, living costs, tutoring and monthly cash stipends.</p>
<p>My daughter is the salutatorian of her class and was rejected by every ivy league college she applied to  &mdash;  but she is already a race realist from our discussions around the dinner table.  Didn&rsquo;t stop the tears, though, when the rejection letters arrived.</p>
<p>Why work hard if the colleges are only going to reject you because of your skin color?  Why take difficult AP classes and tests if they don&rsquo;t mean anything if you&rsquo;re White?  Why should the government mandate that I support universities with my tax dollars so illegal aliens and NAMs can get a free college education?</p>
<p>Brimlowe reports that some of the staunchest anti-immigrant letters he receives are from young Whites in their 20&rsquo;s who have been locked out of colleges and jobs by NAMs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, reality will hit these kids personally and hard when they leave the insanity of the government schools and find they (and all Whites) are not welcome in the multi-cult world they so glorified.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the picture you will notice that not all the kids are white. Did it ever occur to your paranoid mind that these kids might not have anything against white people? If these kids in particular have nothing against me then I have nothing against them. I still don&rsquo;t see why all of you feel threatened by some teenagers, get a life.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My daughter is the salutatorian of her class and was rejected by every ivy league college she applied to &mdash; but she is already a race realist from our discussions around the dinner table. Didn&rsquo;t stop the tears, though, when the rejection letters arrived.&#8221;   Bon</p>
<p>Why not just have your daughter go to community college, and do some ridiculous do gooder volunteer work, or say she did for a year?  Then reapply next spring and check off black in the race box instead of white?  </p>
<p>Works every time. Plenty of college applicants do it.</p>
<p>Preferably the so called volunteer work would be with a marxist feminist black group, also ACORN and NOW. Or raising money to send to Mugabe to buy torture instruments. Claim she&rsquo;s both black and  demonstrates at the local military base every week end to free the Guantanomo terrorists. Maybe a campaign to ban the American flag.</p>
<p>Make up some lunatic liberal group, spend 8 bucks a month on a post office box for the looney group and your daughter is in like Flynn, with a full scholarship, books, all the expenses paid and guaranteed B+ grades even if she never goes to class.</p>
<p>Starting Junior year, job offers will come in unsolicited from every corporation, government agency and non profit in America.  She will be assured of an executive position by January of Senior year, but only if the college puts her on the list of blacks the colleges send out to the employers.</p>
<p>When the college applications come in, they are immediately sorted into racial groups.  No one will bother to notice that she was White last year.  Trust me, it works.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sacrifice your daughter for principle.  </p>
<p>Read some history of English Catholics from 1530 to Catholic Emancipation 1832. You will find many paralells to the situation of American Whites in the 21st century. That is the future of America. Whites need to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>The Catholics who stood on their pride and refused to attend Church of England services were destroyed financially, professionally and in every way because of the fines levied on Catholics.  The fines were sliding scale by the way, so that rich Catholics would be destroyed as well as the middle class.</p>
<p>The Catholic families who smiled and went to C of E services and practiced Catholicism in secret survived those penal years with their property, professions and finances intact.</p>
<p>The Catholics who kept to their religion were forbidden from education and forbidden to practice just about every occupation and profession.  Government agencies were forbidden to use Catholic contractors.  Printers who had government contracts were fined if they bought ingredients for ink from Catholics.</p>
<p>Affirmative action for the Church of Englanders.  Total discrimination against Catholics, just like America today with its vicious discrimination designed to exterminate Whites.</p>
<p>These Catholics who didn&rsquo;t go underground sank to the absolute bottom of English society.  The Catholics who became nominal<br>
C of E survived.</p>
<p>Look at William Shakespeare and his parents.  His Father went from wealthy manufacturer, property owner, alderman and Mayor to poverty in just 15 years due to his refusal to embrace the <br>
CHurch  of England.  He and his family ended up stripped of all property, unable to practice his occupation and living on charity in a hovel because he was tried and convicted several times of being a Catholic.</p>
<p>William held his nose and attended the Church of England.  By hiding his Catholicism he ended up rich and famous.  Had he not attended C of E services, his plays would never have been produced and he would have been lucky to find the most menial low paid occupation.</p>
<p>When the Catholics were at last emancipated from the Penal Laws, it turned out that at least 20 percent of the English (not Irish immigrant) but ethnically English population had been Catholic all along.</p>
<p>Someday Whites might, just might have our 14th amendment rights restored, but don&rsquo;t count on it in the next 50 years.</p>
<p>I have said this before.  The best thing Whites can do for their children is to change their names to hispanic ones when they finish 8th grade.</p>
<p>Then all the opportunities of the nation will be given to them.</p>
<p>If they stay White, they might end up homeless and hungry, because when enough Whites become poor, the liberals will probably ban Whites from welfare just as they now ban us from education, and employment.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.  Have your kid join ACORN, or a PIRG, and volunteer to go out among the deluded, hateful white people, and spread the gospel of socialism and diversity.  They can go door to door and say things like: &#8220;President Obama, HUD, ACORN, and the NAACP want to give rent vouchers to single 19-year old mothers so that they can move into your neighborhood, along with thier latest boyfriend/baby-daddy Dontel (who&rsquo;s on parole), thier brother DeMarius (who just got of the joint), thier uncle Ray-Ray (who&rsquo;s a registered sex-offender), and thier cousin LeShawn, who&rsquo;s an up-and-coming young rapist.  Don&rsquo;t you think you should welcome them in the spirit of diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>We should join these organizations and do a reverse-Gramsci on &#8216;em.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s march through THEIR institutions.</p>

			<p>They are really just kids. I think that given a few years of seeing minorities get promotions and jobs that they are not qualified for and not even getting to apply for those jobs themselves their tune will change. </p>
<p>I think the first wake up for some, if not many, will be when colleges have to cut expenditures and the Whites loose their free rides to illegal or &#8216;others&rsquo; because Colleges DARE NOT cut the illegals, blacks or &#8216;others&rsquo; off.</p>
