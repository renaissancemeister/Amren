<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30393117/">Asian-Americans Blast UC Admissions Policy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new admissions policy set to take effect at the University of California system in three years is raising fears among Asian-Americans that it will reduce their numbers on campus, where they account for a remarkable 40 percent of all undergraduates.</p>
<p>University officials say the new standards  &mdash;  the biggest change in UC admissions since 1960  &mdash;  are intended to widen the pool of high school applicants and make the process more fair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Asian-American advocates, parents and lawmakers] point to a UC projection that said the new standards would sharply reduce Asian-American admissions while resulting in little change for blacks and Hispanics, and a big gain for white students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to call it affirmative action for whites,&#8221; said Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor at UC Berkeley. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s extremely unfair to Asian-Americans on the one hand and underrepresented minorities on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asian-Americans are the single largest ethnic group among UC&rsquo;s 173,000 undergraduates. In 2008, they accounted for 40 percent at UCLA and 43 percent at UC Berkeley  &mdash;  the two most selective campuses in the UC system  &mdash;  as well as 50 percent at UC San Diego and 54 percent at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>Asian-Americans are about 12 percent of California&rsquo;s population and 4 percent of the U.S. population overall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>President defends policy</b></p>
<p>Some Asian-Americans have charged that the university is trying to reduce Asian-American enrollment. Others say that may not be the intent, but it will be the result.</p>
<p>UC officials adamantly deny the intent is to increase racial diversity, and reject allegations the policy is an attempt to circumvent a 1996 voter-approved ban on affirmative action.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary goal is fairness and eliminating barriers that seem unnecessary,&#8221; UC President Mark Yudof said. &#8220;It means that if you&rsquo;re a parent out there, more of your sons&rsquo; and daughters&rsquo; files will be reviewed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yudof and other officials disputed the internal study that projected a drop of about 20 percent in Asian-American admissions, saying it is impossible to accurately predict the effects. &#8220;This is not Armageddon for Asian-American students,&#8221; Yudoff said.</p>
<p>At San Francisco&rsquo;s Lowell High School, one of the top public schools in the country, about 70 percent of the students are of Asian descent and more than 40 percent attend UC after graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are Asian-Americans who are qualified and don&rsquo;t get into UC because they&rsquo;re trying to increase diversity, then I think that&rsquo;s unfair,&#8221; said 16-year-old junior Jessica Peng. &#8220;I think that UC is lowering its standards by doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Increased competition</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest changes is scrapping the requirement that applicants take two SAT subject tests. UC officials say the tests do little to predict who will succeed at UC, no other public university requires them, and many high-achieving students are disqualified because they do not take them.</p>
<p>The policy also widens the pool of candidates by allowing applications from all students who complete the required high school courses, take the main SAT or ACT exams and maintain a 3.0 grade-point average. Under the current policy, students have to rank in the top 12.5 percent of California high school graduates to be eligible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>&#8220;I like to call it affirmative action for whites,&#8221; said Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor at UC Berkeley. &#8220;I think its extremely unfair to Asian-Americans on the one hand and underrepresented minorities on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note the complete lack of concern for underrepresented whites, who are an underrepresented minority in California, thanks to our brilliant immigration policies of the past 40 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are Asian-Americans who are qualified and don&rsquo;t get into UC because they&rsquo;re trying to increase diversity, then I think that&rsquo;s unfair,&#8221; said 16-year-old junior Jessica Peng. &#8220;I think that UC is lowering its standards by doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it would never occur to the precocious 16-year-old burning genius that &#8220;If there are White Americans who are qualified and don&rsquo;t get into UC because they&rsquo;re trying to increase diversity, then I think that&rsquo;s unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantly we hear how brilliant, capable, and accomplished are Asians compared to Blacks and Hispanics. Even here on AmRen!</p>
<p>Asians are just as much a threat to our civilization as are those other minorities. They may not lie in wait in a dark alley with a broken bottle in their hand, but the racial &amp; civilizational displacement is just the same.</p>

			<p>I believe that the Chinese are the biggest threat to USA and Europe, I currently reside in Ireland and when I first came her, I thought I was in Asia! The Chinese were (and still are in spite of the crisis) everywhere in Dublin! I have no idea why they are brought to Eire in such huge numbers. They don&rsquo;t belong here.<br>
I also can&rsquo;t understand how a European man can ever marry a Chinese woman, this is disgusting for me. I personally wouldn&rsquo;t touch a Chinese woman with a stick. <br>
People fought and died for Ireland, they wanted to keep the Irish, Celtic culture, mantain the ethnic structure. Now there are so many young, brainwashed people who think that mixing of races is cool and trendy. For me it&rsquo;s like spitting in the face of the parents and grandparents. Luckily there are many people who think like me, but unfortunately we are in the minority and there are so many stupid people that don&rsquo;t care about their tradition, heritage, culture but only about making money, having sex and being trendy. </p>

			<p>Ha, ha  Nobody deserves this more than the Asians.  </p>
<p>When Prop 209 was first proposed, while signatures were still being solicited to get it on the ballot, the self appointed taxpayer funded Asian leadership groups all joined their non white brethern to denounce Prop 209.</p>
<p>Many assumed that the ordinary Asians would vote in favor of Prop 209 because affirmative action discriminates against qualified people of any race.</p>
<p>But Asians, like blacks and hispanics voted heavily against Prop 209.  They joined the blacks and hispanics to demonstrate and complain about Prop 209.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, Prop 209 really was advantageous for Asians much more than Whites.  </p>
<p>First Prop 209 required admissions based on test scores and grades rather than race  </p>
<p>Next the &#8220;exterminate the Whites&#8221; admissions committees selected merely qualified Asians over highly qualified Whites for many years. Thus the percentages and actual numbers of Asians increased more than any other race.</p>
<p>Third, the admissions committees, in their desire to admit the dumbest gave the most points to the &#8220;Poor, poor pitiful me&#8221; essay instead of SATs and high school grades.  </p>
<p>So even the most pampered Asian Princess from a family rich and powerful for centuries could copy and paste an admissions essay off the internet about how &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; she felt living in a society full of &#8220;sob sob&#8221; evil White people and their White privilege. </p>
<p>&#8220;I may live in a 7 million dollar house.  My family may own houses in Hong Kong, Singapore, San Marino Ca., San Francisco&rsquo;s Pacific Heights, and the best neighborhoods in London and Paris, but I am Asian and thus discriminated against by evil whitey.&#8221;</p>
<p>After 10 years the facist, racist, marxist White hating college admissions committees have realized that Prop 209 is a totally dead letter law and has never and will never be enforced.</p>
<p>So they are back to their old pre Prop 209 tricks of admitting blacks and hispanics with the lowest SATs and high school grades over Asians and Whites with the highest grades and test scores.</p>
<p>The Asians joined the blacks, hispanics and racist, marxist, facist White hating White liberals to destroy the White race.  Why should the Asians be surprised when the liberals turn on them?</p>
<p>What goes around comes around</p>
<p>Liberals need an enemy.  Having destroyed Whites, they now will destroy Asians.</p>

			<p>Good for them. Asians shouldn&rsquo;t have to suffer because self-hating whites want to promote the myth of racial equality. </p>
<p>Instead of punishing Asians for being intelligent and studious, white applicants should be excluded to make room for these unqualified blacks.</p>

			<p>UC will keep the SAT I which is essentially an IQ test. So I don&rsquo;t get how this change in admissions policy will harm bright, fully assimilated Asians, who tend to do somewhat better than Whites on such tests, anyway. It will, however, put at a disadvantage the Asians who have poor English skills, who won&rsquo;t be able to compensate in their applications with a SAT II test in Chinese, Korean, or Chemistry. Of course, the reason they have poor English skills is because they lived all their lives in ghettos with non-English speaking parents. It makes them incapable of working with the majority of Americans, so they have to carve out little Mandarin and Korean speaking niches for themselves in various high tech companies where they openly discriminate against white American workers.</p>
<p>The upshot: Asians will return to somewhat more reasonable levels of representation in UC: 25%, from 40%, while whites will also return to more normal levels of 45%, from 30%.</p>
<p>Remember, whites are almost all American born while the majority of Asians enjoying a low cost public education at UC were born in other countries. And their parents contribute very little to the California tax base. So we owe these Asians a low cost elite college education because, why? Oh, now I remember. So they can train as engineers, steal American technology, then ship it all back to the Middle Kingdom and Mother India.</p>

			<p>If these Asian grads want jobs they will have to go back to Asia. The American economy has collapsed. Good Luck to any college grad regardless of race. You will be joining the ranks of the unemployed soon.</p>

			<p>To those of you who tend to think along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8216;Asians are clean, nice, and I don&rsquo;t mind them in my neighborhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out for themselves, just like any other group trying to displace Whites.  They&rsquo;re only 4% of the population now.  What&rsquo;s going to happen when they&rsquo;re 14% of the population like Blacks?</p>
<p>You think about that.</p>

			<p>This is actually very interesting and probably good news.<br>
My guess is that the U.C. system regents are making these changes because they fear a coming political backlash against the funding of higher education from whites.  </p>
<p>For quite a while in California, every racial group except whites has demanded increased admission rates as a prerequisite for political support of the U.C. system.  The regents probably reason that eventually whites will as well; an eventuality which will no doubt be hastened by the financial collapse.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see much evidence of such sentiment on the ground here in California yet, but it isn&rsquo;t inconceivable <br>
either.  Of course, in the long run, public education is not viable in this country.  The end result of the trajectory we&rsquo;re on is admission by racial headcount in order to ensure political support.</p>

			<p>Does anyone actually believe that these changes are being implemented for the sake of whites in California???</p>
<p>On the contrary, they are being implemented for the sake of blacks, hispanics, and other &#8220;protected groups&#8221; to increase their admissions percentages.</p>
<p>The Asians know that if they protested stating the changes were for the benefit of the &#8220;protected groups&#8221; it would not be politically correct, and be shot down.  Instead they beat up on the few remaining whites in California.  The Asians are extremely tribal and have no love for whites. They are polite until they reach a critical percentage after which they will push out the whites with no hesitation.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;I like to call it affirmative action for whites,&rdquo; said Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor at UC Berkeley.</i></p>
<p>Yes, because we can&rsquo;t get in the way of East Asians using &#8220;diversity&#8221; to get as many of their kindred into universities, can we?</p>

* He also wants <b>enrolment based on <i>racial proportion to population</i></b> as per &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; and blacks?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California#Racial_and_ancestral_makeup" rel="nofollow">After factoring in &#8220;Hispanics of any race&#8221; (36% approx.), &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; (6% approx.) and &#8220;Mixed/American Indian&#8221; (4% approx.)</a> for California we have <i>46% &#8216;non-Asian&rsquo; non-whites</i> which - when added to the 46.5% average of &#8220;Asian-Americans&#8221; attending UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego and UC Irvine overall - we have <i>92.5% non-whites</i> attending university according to &#8220;Professor Wang&rsquo;s&#8221; ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that - despite forming almost 60% of California&rsquo;s population (the real percentage of European whites is probably far lower, but still) - whites will make up the remaining 7.5% of university students, yes?</p>

			<p>Ah, NOW we hear from Asians.  Now that <i>their</i> ox is being gored.</p>
<p>Sorry, too late.</p>
<p>Obviously, all human groups are equal within the cranium.  Ergo, Europeans trailing Asians is due to Asian discrimination against Europeans, Asian privilege, etc.  Ergo, Affirmative Action is needed to right past wrongs.</p>
<p>Does that sound about right?</p>
<p>Sorry Asians, we Europeans could&rsquo;ve used an ally for the last forty years.  Instead, you played ball.</p>

			<p>I think the right way for whites to compete with Asians is to study harder.  The changes the UC officials are making to increase the number of white applicants all amount to using more subjective criteria   &mdash;   the same approach used to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics.  (A 3.0 grade point average means an entirely different thing in a black ghetto school than it does in a good middle class white school.)</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Asian-Americans are about 12 percent of California&rsquo;s population and 4 percent of the U.S. population overall.</p>
<p>This would indicate they should be absolutely no more than 12% of the student body at best.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m disgusted, angered and sick of the relentless whining and sniveling of so-called &#8216;minority groups&rsquo;. Particularly the ones that have come to this country under their own volition over the last 30 years and suckled the government entitlement teat all the way whilst complaining about discrimination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see what their home countries had to offer them in the way of advantages and entitlements&hellip;..but I think we all already know the answer to that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;I like to call it affirmative action for whites,&rdquo; said Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>This is as blatantly a racist statement as you will hear. Whites built that University Mr. Wang and your attending there was a privilege and, I dare say,  your employment was surely a result of racial preferences. Why aren&rsquo;t you back in your homeland teaching your own kind if you don&rsquo;t like it here? I think all of us know the answer to that question, too.</p>
<p>I see more evidence of a White backlash every day. Let&rsquo;s hope we have the courage, will and fortitude to take our country back.</p>

			<p>Welcome to the future.  I wonder if the expanding influence of Asians will be of any use in eliminating racial preferences all together?  Probably not.  They&rsquo;ll still take up a disproportionate share of the spots, and the blacks and latinos will still steal spots from middle-class whites. </p>

			<p>No doubt the university admissions office has come to see that memorising without understanding or the capacity to return meaningful input has caused the university to graduate students who are not genuinely capable of maintaining the innovative and original contributions that European Americans had made before being forced out by the newcomers. These newcomers depend too heavily on rote learning, mindless regurgitation, and plagiarism or other forms of cheating. The Asian students may have slightly higher average scores because only the brighter ones have the wherewithal to migrate. But on the other hand, the paucity of conceptualisation and independent abstract thinking suggests they have very few in their populations significantly above average. </p>

			<p>Even though the Affirmative Action Hoax has a link on all American Renaissance pages, I suggest looking at the website to supplement your reading. I think it will also help convince some people here to buy the book. It has some startling information. One bit of information that is suppressed on the politically correct anti-affirmative action side is that Asians benefit from affirmative action. https://www.affirmativeactionhoax.com/ Remember Asians also include southern Asians.</p>

<p>Asians are overrepresented 3-fold in the UC system. If whites were overreresented to that degree (if it were possible) the cities would be burning.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang founded a group called &#8220;Chinese <b>for</b> Affirmative Action&#8221; back in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang, a staunch ethnic Chinese activist, is a 1957 immigrant TO the United States who hated it here so much, who was so oppressed, that he decided to stay.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang defended several ethnically Chinese spies accused of spying on the United States for the benefit of you-know-who.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang is worried that Asians will get screwed by this new policy.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang is worried that blacks and Hispanics won&rsquo;t benefit from this new poliy.</p>
<p>Ling-chi Wang doesn&rsquo;t care at all what happens to whites.</p>

			<p>I am really surprised at this.  I am married to an Asian, Japanese, and she is not shy about her dislike for blacks or Mexicans.  In fact, almost every Asian I know has voiced their opinions about those two groups and what little they have against whites really doesn&rsquo;t amount to much.<br>
I guess this must be American Asians. Trying to jump on the lucrative get rich off of whitey band wagon.</p>

			<p>Give it another 10-20 years when these huge Asian populations that went through the university system start occupying many of the executive and other higher-paying positions around. Working under a hierarchy of Asian bosses and managers? I don&rsquo;t think that is going to go down too well at all. </p>

			<p>Post-1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; beleive they have a divine right to colonize large sections of California. Well, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The larger issue is this:the resources of America are scarce. The passage of the 1965 immgration refrom act has made competition for the America&rsquo;s scarce resources a brutal rat race competition. How are Native Born White Americans better off because of this? They are obviously not made better off because of this.</p>
<p>America does not need to import its doctors,lawyers,computer programmers,construction workers,engineers,nurses,electricians,plumbers,&hellip;its a very long list from asia. There was 0 economic need to import post-1965 LEGAL immigrant asians.</p>
<p>The mantra of the blessings of diversity is pure propaganda justify the importation of asian LEGAL immigrant scab labor. I don&rsquo;t care if asians pay taxes. Your property taxes will still go up and you will be driven out of your town.,ity and state by asians. The asians have a thoroughly predatory attitude towards Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer is completely silent about asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Take this as a yes vote for asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Vdare.com is not much better. </p>
<p>Here is what WE should tell post-1965 asians in America&#8221;How did Native Born White Americans survive all the years that asians were kept oout?Quite well thank you.</p>
<p>Never be liberally even-handed when discussing asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Because if there is one thing you can be certain of&hellip;the asians in OUR America are not. If and when Native Born White Amerians become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America&hellip;Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; won&rsquo;t suffer any racial guilt over this demographic fact. They will enforce a LEGAL immigration policy that will keep on reducing the size of the Native Born White popuoation of the within the borders of the new &#8220;America&#8221;</p>
<p>Post-1965 asians in America are not natural allies of Native Born White Americans . Someone here should  tell Peter Brimleow and Steve Sailer this. It is disguating to see how some of the above posters are completetly tolerant of asians in OUR America.</p>

			<p>Margaret and Horatius are self serving fools. It is not about asians having higher scores but a system that should serve US citizens over foreigners including asians. Don&rsquo;t forget that a very high percentage of asian students come from wealthy families in asia and are displacing whites and others in the US. We have the same problem in Australia; our Universities are not funded enough by Federal and State Govts. so our Universities go offshore looking for students to fund their campus. Our Govts. should be funding our Universities better so we don&rsquo;t need foreign students. Asian Govts. shouldn&rsquo;t be so lazy and should invest in their educational systems in China, India etc etc.</p>
<p>We get the brightest asians from asia as the poor uneducated asians ouldn&rsquo;t afford a plane ticket to the US. Remember that 10% of China&rsquo;s population and a staggering 40% of India&rsquo;s pop. are illiterate. Asians are taking advantage of the white man&rsquo;s kindness and it is time we woke up and put our people first before others.</p>
<p>If Asians were the smartest why did European/Americans invent electricity, the car, the motorbike, the Tv, the radio, internet, computer, medicine, law, maths and Universities? Look through the pages of the past 500 years since the European reformation and rernaissance and no other group of people have come close to the whites.</p>
<p>asian numbers should be reduced at Universities. It is racist that the asians are demanding more while not considering others. asians should be excluded while whites and blacks should be promoted.</p>
<p>Do asian countries and Universities welcome others? Do asians give preference to others over themselves? No, so why should we?</p>

<p>Stop trying to be clever. Starting in 1972, these asians who you have been hoping would  show solidarity with Native Born White Americans were stealing engineering jobs from Native Born White Men such as my late father. This happened to thousands of these men. Nearly all of them were  vetrans. Why did they bother risking their lives to defend this nation?</p>
<p>I am opposed to making IQ tests scores fudamenatal to White Nationalism because IQ test scores will be used in a vicious ant-Native Born White  capmpaign by asian &#8220;Americans&#8221;. I can easily imagining young Miss Peng on the Berkely campuses justifying the colonization of California by China on the basis of Native Born White intellectual &#8220;inferiority&#8221;.</p>
<p>If giving the oppoetunity, the post-1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; will bury Native Born White Americans in a heart beat. Here is what an asian &#8220;American&#8221; writer said to Peter Brimelow in the pages of the Village Voice in 1995:&#8221;WE WILL BURY YOU!!!&#8221; What do you thik of that Steve Sailer?</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;I like to call it affirmative action for whites,&rdquo; said Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor at UC Berkeley. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s extremely unfair to Asian-Americans on the one hand and underrepresented minorities on the other.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This &#8220;smart&#8221; Asian professor should have kept his mouth shut after his first statement.  As others have noted, he belies his contempt for whites, and his hypocrisy (in implying that it&rsquo;s all about &#8216;the best being the enemy of the good&rsquo;) when he brings in his support for other &#8220;unrepresented minorities&#8221;: ie, blacks and Hispanics. </p>

			<p>Sadly, through hip-hop culture certain values have infected a good part of the young white population&hellip; particularly the idea that using one&rsquo;s brain for anything is uncool.</p>
<p>For better or worse, the future belongs to relatively recent immigrants from cultures that value obedience and rote memorization of scientific and mathematical information. The average Asian student would sit in the corner on his head if a professor told him to, without questioning it at all. That&rsquo;s what employers and educational institutions alike value most.</p>

<p>Why do you call me a self serving fool?  </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t I write about the pampered Asian Princess getting into The University of California on the basis of her essay admitting that she came from a millionaire family? </p>
<p>I am even more aware than you that the richest Asians are taking the places of Native Born Americans not on the grounds that they are better qualified than the natives, but on the grounds that they are poor persecuted minorities no matter how wealthy their family is.</p>
<p>And yes, the way the California college admissions committees got around Prop 209 for the first 5 years was not; to commit obvious discrimination against whites by rejecting superbly qualified Whites in favor of blatantly unqualified blacks and hispanics; but to reject superbly qualified Whites in favor of well qualified, but not superbly qualified Asians.</p>
<p>That resulted in the major purpose of affirmative action; to ban Whites from the university.  Affirmative action is not about helping non Whites.  It is about the genocide of the White race by the White elite.</p>
<p>You know about Australia.  I know all about California.  Even a lowly UC clerical worker can see what goes on in the admission committees. </p>

<p>Ever been to the residential, not the tourist areas of San Francisco? Notice all those little houses? They are 2 bedroom 1 bath 1,000 sq ft houses with a garage underneath.</p>
<p>These houses in the Asian Sunset, Richmond and other areas house as many as 30 people, including the slave laborers the Asian sweatshop owners house in the garage.</p>
<p>Go to Bayview and Silver Av area, still black areas.  You will find the same basic 1,000 sq ft house.  Difference is, maybe 3 to 7 people, a normal family and a relative or 2 living in the same size house the Asians cram 30 or more people in.</p>
<p>The building inspectors were told on pain of losing their jobs to stop inspecting and enforcing the building codes when now Senator Dianne Feinstein was Mayor 25 years ago.</p>
<p>The fact that her billionaire husband, Richard Blum has made most of his money through sweatshop factories and financial manipulation in Asia may have had something to do with Feinstein&rsquo;s orders to let the Chinese and other Asians ignore every Muni Code and regulation existing, including paying city, country and state sales taxes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think the right way for whites to compete with Asians is to study harder. The changes the UC officials are making to increase the number of white applicants all amount to using more subjective criteria  &mdash;  the same approach used to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics. (A 3.0 grade point average means an entirely different thing in a black ghetto school than it does in a good middle class white school.)&#8221;<br>
Posted by WR the elder at 8:41 PM on April 27 </p>
<p>I work at a University of California Campus. You wrote <br>
&#8220;The changes the UC officials are making to increase the number of white applicants&#8221;  The subjective changes relying more on activities, essays and other non academic criteria are absolutely not designed to increase the numbers of Whites.</p>
<p>They are designed solely to increase the number of blacks and hispanics.  There are only so many who can be admitted to each class.  Increasing the number of blacks and hispanics will decrease the number of Whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Until now, the admissions committees had always rejected a White so they could give the place to an unqualified black or hispanic.<br>
Now they are considering also rejecting Asians to increase the numbers of blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>The Asians want the admissions committees to continue their practice of rejecting Whites in favor of blacks and hispanics.  <br>

			<p>Part of this is simply due to different talents per se. Asians on average outdo whites on mathematics tests (although most of the very top scores are in fact from whites) while whites on average, outperform Asians on tests of analytical thinking and reasoning. So what do we call it if we lean on certain tests that favor Asians, Affirmative Action for Asians?  Besides, no matter how it&rsquo;s sliced, when an Asian comes up against whites for an &#8220;open&#8221; spot, when all things are equal - or in fact if the white is slightly better in tests, grades, etc, the Asian gets the nod. It&rsquo;s been that way in the UC system since the mid 70&rsquo;s at least. Which the Asians are aware of, as they&rsquo;ve always been careful when complaining about admissions, to compare Asians against Asians (as in Japanese or Chinese vs lower scoring SE Asians) but not whites. They&rsquo;ve been playing the racial spoils game along with other non-whites for a long time. The Asians cried about the &#8220;essay&#8221; that was added to the SAT, as their writing skills tend be stilted, even if they&rsquo;ve been here for generations. Then they shut up when everyone quietly discovered the essay was actually added to help non-whites and other &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; minorities. All one had to do was work into their essay that they are non-white or gay or what have you and the score immediately soared. </p>

<p>This outcome is inevitable. There is no way to please everyone. What is seen as fair to one, seems discriminatory to another.  </p>
<p>In an &#8220;empire&#8221; built on the false ideal of Diversity (as opposed to a homogeneous nation), where you have a  multiplicity of racial, national, linguistic, cultural, religious and ethnic groups all jostling and contentending for a bigger share of the pie, this sort of squabbling is only to be expected.   And when times get bad, it can get nasty.</p>
<p>It is the price we pay for Diversity.  One of the prices, I should say.  At the moment, we should be glad at least that they are only &#8220;complaining&#8221; instead of battling. It could get much worse. In fact, and given time, history shows that usually it does!</p>

So many, many people miss this essential point!  Even the savvy.   &#8220;Helping non-whites&#8221; is  not really about that at all. It&rsquo;s a deception. It&rsquo;s just a by-product, a secondary &#8220;benefit&#8221;,  and  (most especially) a convenient, noble-sounding excuse to justify and make palatable what they are doing.  It&rsquo;s the sugar coating on the pill that makes the lethal dose go down easier.   Once again, margaret has it exactly right.</p>

<p>When a large Asian popultion move into a Town, they have the numbers to vote for massive yearly increases in school taxes which pushes up the property tax. The property tax is the killer tax. And at their same time their elderly parents from china india and pakistan recieve a check every month from the govrment. The LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians have quite a racket.</p>
<p>Point is:many people miss the point. Tax paying LEGAL IMMIGRNATS will drive up your taxes to the point were you have to sell your house or lose it in a tax lien sale. I know of a case where an elderly woman in her sixties who owned her own home but couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the property taxes in a town where asians flooded in. She fell behind and her home was sold in tax lien sale to a wealthy pakistani LEGAL IMMIGRANT. Who gave the house to his off-the-boat twenty one year old son so he would have a house to raise his future  pakistatni &#8220;American&#8221; family. This is one of the very nasty consequences of racially transforming a Native Born White town through post-1965 immigration policy.</p>

<p>This is so true.  These elderly Asians, Persians, Russians etc etc etc all receive a $900.00 per month government social security check even though they never worked a day in America under the social security system.  2 elders per household adds up to $1,800.00 per month which goes a long way to pay mortgage, taxes and utilities.</p>
<p>Many of these elders are not so elderly.  They often have forged birth certificates and identification from their corrupt country of orign that say they are 10 years older than they really are.</p>
<p>They often work in the family business while collecting social security at age 50.</p>
<p>Then there are their own ethnic physcians who certify perfectly healthy adult immigrants as disabled.  They collect the disability checks while working in the family business.</p>
<p>Their own countries are a mess due to the corruption, criminality and total disregard for law and society as a whole.<br>
They have brought that corruption and criminality to this country.  The tipping point is near.</p>

Ling-chi Wang is actually incorrect in his assessment. </p>
<p>If you had understood the article you would know that the goal was not to increase the percentage of white students. That was just the result. If UC wanted to increase the white student body all they would have to do is start admitting applicants based on their GPA&rsquo;s and SAT scores rather than their race. </p>
<p>If prospective white students were not shutout because of racial quotas every university in America would be almost exclusively white. Which is why these &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; programs were created in the first place. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is that Asians are upset because, now, they may actually have to compete with white students instead of taking advantage of the vacuum created by affirmative action.</p>

<p>This has driven housing prices through the roof California.  These legal immigrants live in family groups with several elderly relatives  &mdash;   each of whom collects SSI of $900/month which they use to out-bid Whites who tend to prefer to live in single family groupings.  This tactic is used to drive Whites out so the legal immigrants can create their own ethno-centric enclaves giving them voting power to take over entire city councils and school boards from the mayor on down.</p>
<p>And, as other posters have pointed out, they are virulently ethno-centric,  racist against outsiders, happy to sell anything to you (happier still to cheat you) but only conduct business with and buy from their own.</p>
