			<p>Hey, look on the bright side fellow readers:<br>
As the Islamic hordes in Europe grow - fuelled by mass-migration, high birth-rates between Muslims and their Muslim/native-convert concubines and even conversion - the same Leftists and &#8220;liberals&#8221; that screamed <i>RACIST!</i> whenever anyone posited what importing millions of Islamic <i>peasants and peons</i>*, and giving them free reign in, Europe would do will be lamenting their new Islamic overlords soon enough.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? You honestly believed that Muslims raised on the Koran would choose women, gay and animal rights and other Enlightnment-values over their holy book?</p>
<p>* Let&rsquo;s face it: The vast majority of Muslim immigrants to Europe in the last half-century or so have been working-class dogmatics - not like the nominally &#8220;Christian&#8221; elites of the West who&rsquo;d abandon their faith in a minute if they could get an extra dollar.</p>

			<p>When my family and I were in London we visited the awesome St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.</p>
<p>I started calling it &#8220;the Temple of Apollo&#8221; because of its classical style and statuary.</p>
<p>LET IT BE THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO, THEN, if Christianity has failed Europe.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T LET IT GO MUSLIM, because &hellip; </p>
<p>I keep thinking of the awesome Buddha statues that the Taliban blew to smithereens. They don&rsquo;t even allow representations of the human form, from what I gather. Not good news for Europe&rsquo;s cathedrals.</p>
<p>Can the ancient Aryan religions attract Europeans, when Christianity seems to be dying? Was it not the European spirit that made Christianity what it became?</p>
<p>We cannot allow these people to destroy the sacred heritage of Europe, the awesome expression of our people&rsquo;s experience of the divine. </p>
<p>There is no telling what they will do.  </p>

			<p>The sad thing here, is that nowhere in this video did they name the real problem the West faces. Indeed, Islam may be a symptom, but the vile and malignant disease is multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Until all of the West accepts this, we cannot stop this waltz to the charnel house our elites have staged for us.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Massive 3rd world immigration into white Western nations (ie. multiculturalism) is a tool the global elite have been using to slowly break apart white Western nations. Ethnic/racial balkanization always results when different &#8220;tribes&#8221; occupy the same land. A cursory look at the last 6,000 years of recorded history proves this. The global elite know that multiculturalism will tear any nation apart from within, which is exactly why they have been pushing multiculturalism for the past 50 years on the West. The global elite want a one world gov&rsquo;t and Western nations stand as the #1 obstacle to this goal, this is why the elite set out some 50 years ago to destroy the West. They have no army to do so and hence they use massive 3rd world immigration to achieve this goal. Combined with massive immigration is a slick public relations campaign with slogans like, &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;, &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221;, etc. All nonsense. Diversity is a weakness, a cancer&hellip; history proves this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled into believing multiculturalism is a strength. The truth is that whites are being targeted. Have you ever noticed that it&rsquo;s only white nations which are subjected to massive immigration and who must henceforth &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221;. Do you hear about diversity campaigns in Japan, China, Middle Eastern countries, African countries, etc.????? Never.</p>

			<p>In this video, which perfecly serves as a wake-up call to the western civilization, most figures about the birth rate of (white) Europeans seem to be in accordance with the numbers I&rsquo;ve seen in other sources.<br>
However, I can&rsquo;t believe that the birthrate of muslims in France is 8.1 as stated in the video - this figure is even higher than the birthrate of the world&rsquo;s most fertile islamic country, Somalia. Can someone verify these numbers, as well as the claim that 50% of all newborns in the Nederlands are supposedly &#8220;islamic&#8221;?</p>
<p>I realized a while ago that most figures on islamic population in European countries used by mass media seem to be outdated. For example, every time the British media published an article which was related to the muslim population in Britain, it stated a number of 1 million. Ironically, the same number was stated in articles published from the year 2001 or so, which means that the current numbers must be higher - much higher I guess.<br>
Why do the media deliberately report faked data?  To avoid shocking people?  Which shock?  The leftist media were at the forefront in their campaign of promoting immigration and multiculturalism, now why do they hesitate to disclose real data to the public?  They have a chance to show us how far they have gone with multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Another mystery to me is the muslim population in the United States. Last time I read an article at MSNBC I think their number was 3 million - which is far away from what the commenter in the video stated (9 million). Any more sources on the US?</p>

			<p>Would I be wrong not to be concerned if these &#8216;muslims&rsquo; were actually white? Strangely, if they were white, folks who just held very odd fundamentalist religious beliefs, political correctness would not have kept them from being kicked out and they&rsquo;d be long gone by now. </p>

			<p>By the year 2030 we&rsquo;re going to need 50% more food in order to feed the growing masses, and by 2050 we are going to need one hundred per cent more</p>
<p>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/professor-warns-of-global-food-riots-1675459.html</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Douglas Kell, chief executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), is calling for an additional £100m a year to be spent on food research in the UK to help the world meet growing demand. </p>
<p>&#8216;He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: &#8220;We have seen already in Indonesia and Mexico riots because of food shortages and what is undeniable is that the amount of food we are going to need to produce to deal with the world&rsquo;s population increases is an extra 50 per cent by 2030 and a doubling by 2050.&rsquo; </p>
<p>RK:  Doesn&rsquo;t it seem a bit silly for these leftist types to constantly publish articles like the above about Muslim numbers telling us that whites are going to be losing their land and influence long into the future, yet they NEVER mention anything to do with resource shortages, which, unlike deomographics, are far easier to forecast more accurately, since demographic projections can turn on a dime?</p>
<p>I wonder if they ignore more crucial matters in favor of racial demographics, because they want whites to accept defeat without a peep, making whites more amenable to their rainbow coalition.</p>
<p>Too, isn&rsquo;t it amazing in a time of intense economic turmoil they are so certain that their predictions are inevitable?</p>

			<p>&#8220;A call to action&#8221;. - Yeah but WHAT action?</p>
<p>I think there are some exaggerations in the numbers: probably only about 3 million Muslims at most in the US - Muslims are always exaggerating their numbers - but the Western World and its democracy based civilization is in very serious trouble as anyone can see who studies and disovers the horrific nature of Islam (Read Robert Spencer). </p>
<p>What this program doesn&rsquo;t show, however, is how the situation deteriorates as the Muslim population increases. For this see the video &#8220;What Islam Is Not&#8221;: </p>

want to start WW3 with Iran haven&rsquo;t a clue. France<br>
will be a Muslim Nuclear Power in a few decades-in<br>
fact they are already lost to NATO due to their Mus-<br>
lim minority. And the Armed Forces will be majority<br>
Muslim much sooner than the nation as a whole. And<br>
these same Yahoos are in favor of bringing ever more<br>
Muslims into America. One has to ask why. And there<br>
is an answer: these people aren&rsquo;t just traitors but<br>
lunatics.</p>

			<p>Religion means &#8220;binding together.&#8221; When people agree to bind themselves together for a common fate and common ideals, Nature rewards them with children. Inside that binding or ring of shared identity, they are protected from the corruption of the outside world. </p>
<p>When people abandon that binding, when their ring of mutual protection is dropped to the ground, then they will be prey to outside forces. When people abandon their shared ideals and pursue individual goals, they will no longer grow and prosper. They wither and die because they have no hope for the future. </p>
<p>Atheism is a death sentence. Period. Racialism might never be a dominant ideology in the United States, but Christian Constitutionalism is much more real for most people. It&rsquo;s better in a way, since it taps into our shared Christian roots. </p>
<p>People who have many children out of wedlock are not Christians. People who rob and loot and depend on the government for a living are not Christians. Men and women who spend their lives pursuing ego gratification instead of putting work into family life are not Christians. People who break the law and come into someone else&rsquo;s country are not Christians. People who are addicted to drugs are not Christians. See how this goes? </p>
<p>Combine that with Constitutionalism and the American tradition and you have something very powerful and real. </p>

<p>Well, maybe our U.S. census is including the more than 200,000 breeding Somali, black muslims we have breeding HERE now. How many muslims and mosques are in Dearborn, Michigan now anyway. The population of muslims and black converts MUST be in the tens of millions now and the black overall population of the U.S. is STILL WAY ABOVE the 10-12%, it&rsquo;s mnore like 45% I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

			<p>The 1991 census showed there were around three million people born overseas living in the United Kingdom. Thirty years ago, there were around two million. Across the country, the proportion of overseas-born residents is now around 10 per cent; but in London, it is closer to 30 per cent and in some parts of the capital, it is 50 per cent. Such record levels, plus greater longevity, have caused the Government actuaries to recalculate population growth. They now think it will pass the 65 million mark in 2023 and reach 70 million by 2031, placing huge pressure on public services and pensions. The Government maintains that its points-based immigration system will arrest this growth but many analysts doubt it will make any difference.</p>
<p>The cross-party parliamentary balanced migration group, using the Government&rsquo;s own figures, recently calculated that immigration would have fallen by about 12,000 last year if the new measures had been in place. To hold the population to 65 million - a rise of about four million on current numbers - would require a reduction in net immigration to near zero, a migration level last seen in the early 1990s. In other words, net annual immigration would have to fall by 180,000 if the population is not to hit 70 million. When ministers were supporting large-scale immigration, they liked to depict Britain as a nation of immigrants that in the past has absorbed Huguenots from France, Jews from Europe and Asians kicked out of east Africa, often to its advantage. But today&rsquo;s levels of immigration are far higher than anything seen before and will have a far more profound effect on the shape and nature of our society than previous migrations. Even senior Labour figures such as Frank Field have voiced their concerns that the country is unprepared, both culturally and practically, to cope. More immigrants being imported but 50% of babies born are non-white</p>

			<p>Where are the white people of Europe suppose to go after the Islamic hordes overrun that continent?</p>
<p>The United States? Hardly. The only reason the U.S. hasn&rsquo;t been completely overrun ourselves is the Atlantic and Pacific oceans prevent massive immigration. But we will soon be in the same boat as Europe.</p>
<p>The only hope for white people is Canada and Siberia. Of course when white people move there non-whites will quickly follow.</p>

			<p>I have had the opportunity to travel to Western Europe many times over the years. I have friends who go there regularly to enjoy the high level of culture,(there isn&rsquo;t much in the Southwest)including, wine festivals, symphonic music concerts, and even beer gardens,etc. One of my long time friends is an antique piano dealer and often travels to Europe on business and to hear concerts. Western Europe can be a fun place. </p>
<p>Western Europeans,in general, have become the most lamblike, docile,and submissive individuals in the world. Most have been taken in by the multiculturalism taught in their ultra liberal universities. That they may be overtaken by Muslim culture soon, would surprise no one who has interacted with Western Europeans. They aren&rsquo;t even conscious of the meaning of the bloody battles of the past,that their ancestors fought to be rid of Islamic influence. It means zero to them. Their hundreds of magnificient cathedrals should be an inspiration to them of the willpower and faith that their ancestors had, but instead,are irrelevant to most Europeans. </p>

<p>Good post - Actually living in Europe, outside of all American influence is even better.  I did this for some time and I can tell you that life is much richer for the average individual in Europe than in this country.  Here, it is all about consuming and trying to be the best and have the best - but not really knowing what that even means.  </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Europeans, even the Eastern ones, want to live in Elysium.  They don&rsquo;t want to dwell on the bloody, lousy past.  They are a bit like latter day Romans who want pleasures, but no reminders of a painful past or present.  They hate being goaded into doing anything.  They have become quite adept at playing the U.S. government for all its worth as well because this allows their illusion to continue.  But this fits in with my previous post about how Europeans are as a people, emotionally drained.  They have nothing more to offer the history books.  Two devasting World Wars killed off most of their best.  Whatever the reason, my impression is that the European has retreated from the front, permanently.  They revel while life lasts with not much thought of the future.  They just pretend that life is beautiful and they make it so - with increasing difficulty, for the present.</p>
<p>My heart aches for them, and us.</p>

			<p>First of all, I think some of the data in this video is false.  Second, people need to realize how these demographic projections are made: the estimators take the current data - birth rates, immigration rates, etc. - and calculate what will happen if these current rates remain constant over decades.  There are several problems with this - 1) Muslim birthrates will drop.  Initially, immigrants always have elevated birthrates.  After a generation or two, the immigrant group&rsquo;s birthrate levels off and resembles that of the host nation. 2) The current levels of Muslim immigration will not remain constant.  European nations are already beginning to restrict immigration, and this will only increase in the future as Europe becomes more and more crowded and Europeans became more and more concerned over immigration.<br>
I think Muslim immigration is a huge threat to Europe, but videos like this are unneccesarily alarmists.  They do more damage to our movement than good because they cause many people to believe that our situation is hopeless.  Here are some positive things to keep in mind: 1) when you hear that the population of a certain European country is 20% foreign-born, keep in mind that, usually, at least half of these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are just people from other European countries, 2) with the exception of France, pretty much every country in Europe is at least 90% white, 3) most European countries have very strict citizenship requirements, so most of these immigrants and their children can be told to leave at any time, 4) even though Europe is still much &#8220;whiter&#8221; than America, Europeans are already beginning to wake up and support for nationalist parties across the continent is increasing, 5) there are some indications that European birthrates have bottomed out and may slowly begin to rebound, 6) polls tend to indicate that European youth are much more &#8220;right-wing&#8221; when it comes to their views on immigration than there parents are, so the future is in good hands, 7) immigrant populations in Europe are concentrated in large cities, making it appear to the common observer that the situation is worse than it actually is, 8) the economic downturn will likely cause many European governments to have to dramatically scale down social services, eliminating one of Europe&rsquo;s major magnets for third-world immigration.  The list could go on and on.  Certainly, things are bad, but now is not the time to lose hope and give up.  Stay positive and keep fighting.  </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that part of the problem is the United States. For far too long America has coddled Europe and allowed it to shelter under its defensive wing. This has encouraged Europe to turn itself into a welfare state-continent and think that Americans will always look after them. America should withdraw from NATO and FORCE Europe to get realistic about its situation and prospects.</p>

			<p>I honestly wonder whether Europe will become part Islamic by 2100 or even 2050, especially places like France, Italy, Spain, and maybe even Germany and the UK. The rest of the Europeans will retreat to the north, and the line will be drawn when Russia moves west and drives back the advancing Muslims. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget folks, whites do have the US and Canada. Think about that. The cities have minorities, but whites have most of the countryside. That means something. We need to hold onto the green forests, the cold mountains, the rivers and lakes. That is our natural habitat that Nature fashioned us for. </p>

			<p>  I believe the Muslim threat to Europe is greater than the United States because the European countries in question are smaller. However, in my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve certainly witnessed the growth of Islam from an insignificant number of adherents to a substantial minority. They have already surpassed Jews in numbers as our largest non Christian minority. </p>
<p>As their numbers increase, I believe they will be much more politically assertive  &mdash;  we can count on that. With multiculturalism being the dominant American philosophy does the Muslim demand for separate &#8220;Shiria&#8221; courts seem so farfetched for the future? Demands for Gay marriage were unthinkable twenty years ago. Will Muslim polygamy be officailly recognized in another twenty years?</p>
