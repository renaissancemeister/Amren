<h1><a href="https://www.digitaljournal.com/article/270674">Did Integration Negatively Affect Discipline for Black Kids?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol Forsloff, Digital Journal, April 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Outcomes of integration haven&rsquo;t been as positive as hoped. According to a number of African Americans equal opportunity was the goal of civil rights, not integration. Results have shown negative consequences, some say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dumars [Ophelia Dumars, mother of Joe Dumars, a famous basketball player] declares that &#8220;after integration discipline broke down.&#8221; New ways of parenting from the white community were introduced that conflicted with the strict parenting set down by black parents. She said in her day there weren&rsquo;t the high percentages of African Americans in jail because parents and community members made sure they were disciplined strictly and understood consequences of bad behavior. That was passed on down to the next generation until new ideas were introduced that seemed to bring consequences that didn&rsquo;t end up with positive results. Corporal punishment was the means of disciplining that seemed to make children behave. These days Dumars believes parents don&rsquo;t do that anymore and so many of them don&rsquo;t know their limits.</p>
<p>Randy Stelly, native Louisianan who grew up with strict parents who had successful businesses in Opelousas in South Louisiana, believes also that integration interfered with the raising of black children. His concern was that discipline in school wasn&rsquo;t even-handed and was fraught with suspicion and distrust. Black parents resented white teachers disciplining their children. Conversely white parents didn&rsquo;t want black teachers disciplining theirs. The lack of understanding and preparation for adults prior to integration meant that children had unequal treatment in discipline and those for whom expectations were less, often black, ended up with discipline problems. What black folks wanted, he said, was decentralization, equal opportunity. He too is concerned that too many black children end up in prison for lack of effective, consistent discipline.</p>
<p>The dialogue about this has been part of African American conversation on the Internet as well as locally in Natchitoches. Attorney Roy Miller on a blog post writes that integration has been cruel to black children. {snip} He said before integration black teachers had very little problem with discipline of students, a point verified by Dumars as well, who was often at school involved with her children. She too believes that black teachers had stern control and were trusted by the children at the time. Miller reinforces this concept in his posting as well.</p>
<p>Miller goes on to discuss how integration broke down black values. He said that after integration black teachers were disciplining black students and white teachers were as well, and then &#8220;all hell broke loose.&#8221; He continues by saying that after integration blacks got new learning materials and books, however black moral and religious values were broken down, which brought an increase in black crime. These are some of the issues he relates:</p>
<p>&#8220;In majority Black school districts, White kids left and went to private schools. Public schools were segregated all over again. {snip} We need to admit it. White parents are not ever going to let Black teachers paddle White children, Black parents are not ever going to let White teachers paddle Black children and Black parents are distrustful of their children being disciplined in the public school system. &#8220;</p>

			<p>Forced Integration resulted in the swift downfall of society. It is one of the main reasons our society has crumbled. But there are even DEEPER issues than just education. Blacks and whites cannot live together in the same society. &#8220;Equal Treatment&#8221; is not the same as co-habitation. </p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t behave no matter WHAT environment they live in, all over the world. They are &#8220;distrustful&#8221; of discipline in the school systems, but also in society at large. (But they have ALSO demonstrated around the world that theirs is a  society, BASED ON criminality). Until THAT is stated, nothing else can or will be solved.</p>

			<p>Then why can&rsquo;t these black parents bring back the discipline style which was supposedly so good?  I agree that the dismantling of segregation changed discipline for blacks, but it wasn&rsquo;t the parents that changed, it&rsquo;s the white society and authorities that changed.</p>
<p>Besides, have black parents themselves changed that much?  There was a story here at AR a few weeks back about the black style of corporeal punishment.  If it worked so well, why did it &#8220;work&#8221; in 1950 and not in 2009?</p>

			<p>Prof. Raymond Wolters&rsquo; new book Race and Education 1954-2007 provides interesting evidence of racial differences in discipline. A certain liberal sociologist visited black schools in St. Louis back the 1960s, and was horrified to learn that black teachers</p>
<p>&#8220;adopted a repressive style of classroom management. Unlike many white teachers in upscale suburban schools, the inner-city teachers would not allow students to get out of their seats, wander around the room, and speak with other children. Sometimes suburban teachers embraced their students, and they often spoke sympathetically to a child. In the suburbs, teachers seemed &#8216;almost afraid of hurting a young child&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo; By way of contrast, teachers in the inner city acted like &#8216;drill sergeants.&rsquo; They insisted on &#8216;silence in the classrooms and halls and&hellip;tight control over the children.&rsquo; &#8216;There was no letup in the strict, punitive treatment of [inner-city] children.&rsquo; <br>
The black teachers were skeptical of letting white sociologists observer their classroom, correctly guessing that they &#8220;would not understand &#8216;why the [inner-city] teachers needed to be strict disciplinarians.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>After integration, the white liberals found out: widespread vandalism, theft and violence broke out when black children were suddenly introduced into the more easygoing white-run schools. See: Raymond Wolter, Race and Education, Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 2008.<br>
Or, as Edmund Burke put it: &#8220;Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.&#8221;<br>

			<p>They do have a point but the welfare system had more to do with it.  Also, people forget that, in the 50s, whites would not put up with blacks misbehaving.  Blacks taught their kids to bight their tongues and show respect for whites because if they didn&rsquo;t the white community would go after them.  In other words fear kept them acting responsible.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In majority Black school districts, White kids left and went to private schools. Public schools were segregated all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is incorrect. It is only sensible black schools, with a rich tradition, that remain segregated. White schools must have diversity and integration. It&rsquo;s a one way process.  </p>
<p>&#8220;White parents are not ever going to let Black teachers paddle White children&#8221;.</p>
<p>White parents not letting black teachers paddle their children? This is intended to come off as a kind of exhumation of the terrible past when in reality he is merely writing a blueprint for the future.</p>

			<p>Of course black children need strict discipline.  Blacks do not understand right and wrong, they only fear of repercussions for their actions.  This was evident in a recent article in AR entitled, &#8220;Morality and Abstract Thinking.&#8221;     </p>

			<p>Integration didn&rsquo;t cause discipline to break down. An open society where blacks were no longer being constrained by whites has simply allowed blacks to exhibit their natural behavior unrestrained. </p>

			<p>I think there is something too this; I grew up down the street from some blacks and the father used to beat the mess out of all his kids for looking at him funny.  Those kids went on to do okay, not like the other blacks at our school, half ended up in jail by 25.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did Integration Negatively Affect Discipline for Black Kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>It did indeed.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it was undeniable proof to blacks that they could in no way compete with whites for anything that had to do with intelligence, and other important abilities.</p>
<p>Being told all their lives that they&rsquo;re just as capable, just as smart as whites, then find out that it isn&rsquo;t just whites they lag behind, but every other race as well, is responsible for giving them bad attitudes all the way down the line.  </p>
<p>Bad parantage and propensity for crime has a lot to do with their incompetence, but the great shocker to blacks is in being stunned by the facts of life which blaringly show them that they can&rsquo;t compete, nor can they learn at a level that&rsquo;s acceptable.</p>
<p>So, they reject any kind of education, rather than risking failure by an inability to learn, using the excuse that anybody who tries to learn is &#8220;acting white,&#8221; as if that was the worse thing imaginable.  What they mean is that they would rather have a scape goat to blame for their failures instead of admitting that they just can&rsquo;t learn on the same level.</p>
<p>Integration hurt blacks far more than it did whites, actually, because their crime rates are through the roof; their out-of-wedlock births are at 72% now; their H.S. drop out rate is over 50% and the ones who stay in school can&rsquo;t read, write or do basic math but are passed just to get them out the door and make them someone else&rsquo;s problem. Plus there are so many other pathologies they&rsquo;re too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Would this have occurred without integration?</p>
<p>I think it would to some extent, but their situation wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly so bad if integration had never occurred.<br>

			<p>No one asks what&rsquo;s best for white kids&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this story&hellip; and there may be some truth to it somehow&hellip; but I also think of the large, monumental effort, on the part of song writers, TV executives, and movie producers, to try and get guardians to stop abusing children and how this news story flies in the face of this huge and dedicated effort. </p>

			<p>I agree with all in the above paragraph.  But, it goes beyond being just a problem for blacks.  Whites, too, have been victims of very lenient and inconsistent discipline.  We have let the social &#8220;experts&#8221; ruin all the rules of a highly-productive and law-abiding society.  Liberalism has failed everyone and everything it touched and touches.  Nothing straightens a kid out faster than a stinging, red hiney.  The Baby Boomer generation was the first casualty of a society gone bad and mad.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re black or white, liberalism has eroded any assemblance of what was a respectable, lawful, hard-working, and grateful people.</p>
<p>The downfall of religion has also hurt the nation.  Whether you believe or not, religion does serve a greater purpose in that it promotes honesty, respect, discipline, and integrity.  There is nothing wrong with the institution of religion.  Unfortunately, too many religious leaders are like government officials&hellip; greedy, corrupt, selfish, self-serving and highly incompetent.<br>

			<p>OK, this is about it.</p>
<p>I know black people blame white people for everything, but this one truly has me ROFLMAO.</p>
<p>According to this &#8220;logic&#8221;   &mdash;   and once and for all, aren&rsquo;t black people the most illogical people in the world?   &mdash;   there should be even more white kids in jail than blacks, due to the lousy methods of white parenting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick and tired of hearing that these people   &mdash;   of all people!   &mdash;   were so pure, noble, good and outstanding until they were ruined by the evil white people.</p>
<p>As for their &#8220;strict&#8221; discipline.  The Walmart I attend has a heavy contingent of black customers.  Due to its (unfortunate) proximity to all kinds of public transportation, quite a few come in from the poorest part of the ghetto.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve seen the mothers (never any fathers, of course) &#8220;disciplining&#8221; their kids in ways that are dangerously close to child abuse.</p>
<p>I heard one say, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t stop whining, I&rsquo;m going to knock you over with this cart!&#8221; and she made a violent movement with the cart toward him.</p>
<p>The next time I went, I heard one (a different one &hellip; I guess) say, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t shut up, I&rsquo;m going to knock you into the middle of next week!&#8221;</p>
<p>So are those the &#8220;consequences of bad behavior&#8221; the kids are supposed to understand?</p>
<p>The young boys are the ones that really don&rsquo;t stand a chance in life when that&rsquo;s their image of women.</p>
<p>Even my old, cold heart breaks when I see a cute, inquisitive little black boy ask a relatively intelligent question, only to be told, &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; and is either hit or slapped or at least threatened with it.  And I see this happen discouragingly frequently.</p>

			<p>This is classic:  &#8220;New ways of parenting from the white community were introduced that conflicted with the strict parenting set down by black parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>This presents an image of a husband and wife, committed to doing the best for their children, weighing different options and alternatives and trying to intelligently incorporate new concepts of parenting into their repertoire of ideas.</p>
<p>The reality is closer to:  a teenage girl whose kid gets on her nerves, so she hauls off and smacks him.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, I say the reason so many young black men end up in gangs and engaging in violent, antisocial and criminal behavior   &mdash;   and the reason they routinely refer to women in bad terms such as &#8220;ho&#8221; and &#8220;b*tch&#8221;    &mdash;   is because of the rotten, stinkin&rsquo; way they were raised by their clueless single mothers.  It had NOTHING to do with picking up bad ideas from the white community!</p>

			<p>This article is on-point. A co-worker of mine, who grew up in the fifties (Loisiana) said times were better for blacks in school than the liberal union controlled public schools of today. I agree wholly with the AmRen posters on the notion of IQ and deferred gratification being reasons for black behavior; I also agree with the notion that liberalism and political correctness has dumbed-down an already struggling segment of society. White guilt has stifled the education system, by giving blacks a free pass on what I call &#8220;hip-hop discipline&#8221; common among blacks today - they beat their kids to a point that it becomes a joke, and the kids fear a beating from mom and pops over the authority of society at large. Coupled with an enabling justice system, prison becomes a badge of honor among blacks, and they take out their frustrations on White people upon release. Black on White crime is a chronic disaster, thanks to the enabling ways of leftist thought and the victimhood mentality. To a black, killing is easy, prisom is easy, but taking responsibility for actions is tremendous chore&hellip;<br>

			<p>One reason black children received more discipline 50 years ago is that they were more likely to be raised in a two parent home.</p>
<p>Now, most are raised by single moms and when Mom is at work or in jail these little thugs run amok. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;New ways of parenting from the White community were introduced that conflicted&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is anyone surprised that Whites are (again, always) blamed for black failure?</p>
<p>Tom Sowell writes that those who demonized the 1965 Moynihan Report &#8216;a meticulous piece of research, [which] described the ongoing disintegration of the black family, as demonstrated especially by the weakened role of men&rsquo; never paid any price  &mdash;  the problems were swept under the rug and Moynihan was excoriated by a firestorm of criticism for &#8216;blaming the victim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the present black community, broken homes and children raising children have produced poisonous consequences ranging from school failure to drugs to murder.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, according to Walter Williams, these are the results of LBJ&rsquo;s 60&rsquo;s misguided War on Poverty:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Black illegitimacy stands at 70 percent; nearly 50 percent of black students drop out of high school; and only 30 percent of black youngsters reside in two-parent families.</p>
<p>In 2005, while 13 percent of the population, blacks committed over 52 percent of the nation&rsquo;s homicides&hellip;Such pathology, I think much of it precipitated by family breakdown, is entirely new among blacks.</p>
<p>In 1940, black illegitimacy was 19 percent; in 1950, only 18 percent of black households were female-headed compared with today&rsquo;s 70 percent. Both during slavery and as late as 1920, a teenage girl raising a child without a man present was rare among blacks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/dd3new" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/dd3new</a></p>
<p>The black community must take a harsh look at its huge illegitimacy rate, especially the dangerous pathology of fatherless boys  &mdash;  because no White would dare mention it without grave risk to his career and reputation. </p>
<p>As such, the solutions will have to come from the black community  &mdash;  but I suppose in the end, black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; will continue to denounce and blame Whites for black dysfunction  &mdash;  much easier to extract money, government services and preferences that way.</p>

<i>&#8220;Outcomes of integration haven&rsquo;t been as positive as hoped.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Wanting a social theory to be true and it being true are two different things. Some people want to believe that the races are interchangeable and that integration will ultimately result in racial harmony. Both are beliefs and neither is true.</p>
<p>You would have to be blind or a liar not to admit that integration has failed blacks. All it&rsquo;s done has shown blacks how they&rsquo;re not white. Forcing blacks to try to compete at a white level has done nothing but spotlight racial differences and bred resentment at black failure.</p>
<p>Listen to black talk radio and you&rsquo;ll hear blacks pining for the good old days when blacks had their own communities and businesses, when blacks graduated from school, when neighborhoods were safe.</p>
<p>All that changed with forced integration because it put blacks in competition with whites and blacks can&rsquo;t compete on a white level.</p>
<p>Even after the 50th anniversary of Brown vs Board, black Harvard professors were openly saying that maybe they pushed the wrong agenda. Maybe instead of demanding integrated schools, they should have demanded simply equal funding of schools.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that many blacks see integration as a failure but they can&rsquo;t say so because to do so would be to admit that their leaders such as MLK JR were wrong.</p>

			<p>&#8220;the inner-city teachers would not allow students to get out of their seats, wander around the room, and speak with other children&#8221;<br>
Posted by F. Roger Devlin at 5:46 PM on April 9 </p>
<p>These &#8220;inner city&#8221; teachers were simply doing what all teachers did before the 1950&rsquo;s. From 7th grade to graduate school, most of the classes that I have been in contained Blacks. None complained about the teachers enforcing the &#8220;repressive style of classroom management&#8221;, even the Blacks (and Whites) who were punished because of it. </p>

			<p>I hate to sound old fashioned but anyone who has ever raised a teenage boy of any race knows how important it is to have a FATHER around to impose order. He doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to resort to physical punishment (though its often unavoidable) but the presence of a physically more powerful male figure reminds newly masculine teenagers that if need be, father will lay down the law. <br>
With that said, paying black women to have fatherless children seems like a great idea!</p>

I see two themes come up regularly when this topic is discussed:</p>
<p>  1.  Blacks treat their kids with abusive violence, and this causes psychological damage to the kids. (Expressed in some of the comments above.)</p>
<p>  2.  Black kids only understand physical punishment as a form of discipline, and so it is necessary to teach them discipline. (Expressed in the aricle.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which one is right. </p>

<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t seem to win a trick with you, QD.  </p>
<p>I believe black critiques of liberal fads should be welcomed, particularly if they recognize the inherent flaws, or at least difficulties, in insisting on identical treatment of all groups.  If blacks can realize that stricter classroom discipline methods are more appropriate for them, regardless of the standards whites (or anybody else) has in mind for them, there is good reason to hope they might realize racial autonomy in all aspects of life is preferable, no matter what the integrationist or equally obstructionist &#8220;sucess = a gazillion dollars&#8221; boosters claim.</p>

			<p>Given the fact that many White parentrs allow their children to use drugs, drink and have premarital sex, it is not surprising that when some (not all) Blacks intergrated in the larger society that they adopted such unwholesome, retrograde behavior.</p>

			<p>Seeinag as how adult blacks have the maturity level of 14 year olds. They are a race of evolutionary children. It IS our fault the situation is a mess. We have allowed fantasy-world liberalism to be the widely accepted mentality. WE lost control of our media. It is our fault. They are right in blaming us. Not b/c were evil, but b/c wev&rsquo;e become irresponsible. The entire group of American blacks as a whole are children and we need to go back to disciplining them through intimidation like we used to. It&rsquo;s the only thing they understand.</p>

			<p>Ever noticed that no matter what, whites are blamed for everything? When schools were segregated, blacks complained that they had to go to school with whites in order to get a good education. Now that schools are integrated, they complain that whites have ruined  their kids. Let&rsquo;s look at the real reason black kids are failing. It&rsquo;s due to their parents, especially a lack of father and the lousy way many blacks raise their kids. Only blacks can correct this.</p>

			<p><i>Unlike many white teachers in upscale suburban schools, the inner-city teachers would not allow students to get out of their seats, wander around the room, and speak with other children.</i></p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;reminds me of my own schoolyears between 1956-1968 in the former Czechoslovakia. I still do not get why children should be allowed to do anything of this at school. We were sitting in classes with no less than 30 students, so how could anyone concentrate on learning, if this would not be the case?</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve seen the mothers (never any fathers, of course) &ldquo;disciplining&rdquo; their kids in ways that are dangerously close to child abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I&rsquo;ve seen, I say the reason so many young black men end up in gangs and engaging in violent, antisocial and criminal behavior  &mdash;  and the reason they routinely refer to women in bad terms such as &ldquo;ho&rdquo; and &ldquo;b*tch&rdquo;  &mdash;  is because of the rotten, stinkin&rsquo; way they were raised by their clueless single mothers. It had NOTHING to do with picking up bad ideas from the white community!&#8221;</p>
<p>You still really don&rsquo;t get it about the blacks. They are not like you. Their motivations are not like yours. Clark said it but then lost his own logic: blacks have little or no sense of the future, they have little or no ability to string along a logical thought and follow it to its consequences. (I bet money that their neurons physically fire differently in a more unguided explosive way).</p>
<p>Blacks are incredibly (for us) motor impulsive and muscle reactive in all ways. This is not because of the way they are raised, but physical punishment imposed by a parent can help get their anti-social behavior under control. Make note: physical discipline for a physical-reactive tendency. Physical punishment is not &#8220;child abuse&#8221; for these people. It is not a &#8220;product of their upbringing.&#8221; It is an inevitable result of their biological make up. </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s liberalized whites have real trouble understanding this because it is first alien to white psychology and motivation, and second because whites have been trained to ignore and cut off their own instinctive reflexive responses. You need to understand that blacks, especially black males, are completely different from whites inside in all ways. </p>
<p>You need to really understand that, not so that you can jeer or make jokes or feel &#8220;superior&#8221; (more ego-stroking rot) but so that you can truly see without doubt that physical separation is the only way we can get our society functioning again. </p>

			<p>What whites don&rsquo;t understand is that there is no such thing as mental self-discipline for many or most black males. There is no mind to discipline as you and I understand it. </p>
<p>What can work is physical discipline of the black male body through physical punishment. It is more like training an athlete&rsquo;s body to hold back and wait for the flag before starting a sprint. It is physical discipline, only, but it works for black male bodies.</p>
<p>Black male minds are a lost cause. There is no mind to train in many cases, and that physical discipline never is internalized as a &#8220;sense of morality&#8221; in the way whites understand that. Maybe that&rsquo;s why slavery worked in making blacks productive. Forget what that &#8220;means&#8221; to your delicate white sensibilities, because these black males are nothing like you inside. </p>

			<p>The discipline problems mentioned in this article are the result of blacks struggling to conform to white societal norms. Black norms are evident in Africa: polygamy, low intellectual attainment, substance abuse, hair trigger violence, tribalism, and subsistence agriculture   &mdash;   all the things that shocked Obama when he witnessed them in Kenya.</p>
<p>Almost all the major African cities, once purged of the founding white colonials and their western capital, have turned into decaying urban slums like Detroit, but without white taxpayer bailout money to keep black people fed. When opportunities to grift run out, an African city dweller just takes off his shoes and walks back into the bush. In the United States, that&rsquo;s obviously not an option.</p>
<p>Blacks are naturally a hunter-gatherer people, and cruel, aggressive, ADHD like behavior is the norm. The only way to get a black population to naturally adjust to white society would be through genetic selection, to speed up the evolution of black psychology and cognition to more closely resemble the cooperative, analytic mentality of Europeans. Of course, the likelihood of that is zero, because it would be perceived, and correctly so, as an assault on black identity by white geneticists.</p>
<p>So the way I see it, integration in the US (or anywhere else) never had a chance of working: lions will not lie down with lambs. And when they do, the outcome is certain. Apartheid South Africa was perhaps the only pragmatic example of a multiracial society, where the race that was capable of nation building   &mdash;   that is, establishing a viable economy and adapting to rule of law   &mdash;   wholly controlled the federal government while the other races were settled in semi-autonomous tribal homelands to minimize inter-ethnic conflicts and maximize self-determination, for good or ill.</p>

			<p>Abe Lincoln had a formative moment when he was a young lawyer traveling the &#8220;circuit&#8221; in Illinois. He was riding in a coach with a gang of black slaves. The slaves were all in chains, but they were singing and laughing and carrying on.</p>
<p>Lincoln made the same mistake that whites have been making for centuries now, and imagined what he, Abe Lincoln the sensitive intelligent white man, would feel like in those circumstances. He saw a double injustice: not only were these blacks in chains, but somehow their intellects had been broken so that they were singing in apparent joy. That was Lincoln&rsquo;s way of making sense of what seemed to him a tragic and absurd situation. Lincoln and the Abolitionists of his day though that slavery was responsible for morally degrading blacks and preventing their development, and much blood was spilled under that assumption. </p>
<p>What Lincoln didn&rsquo;t understand is that most blacks don&rsquo;t have a mind to break. They probably do better in chains, because then other men externally impose the discipline that blacks lack within themselves. </p>
<p>Whites never learn. Every generation intelligent, thoughtful, caring whites feel pity for the blacks and try to figure out how to &#8220;fix&#8221; them. What they never understand until it&rsquo;s too late is that these blacks are not &#8220;broken&#8221; and trying to &#8220;fix&#8221; them just amounts to pouring more and more water into sand. Every generation we try. Abolition, Civil Rights, now the Obama craze. It ends in disappointment every time, but only when it is too late, and the newer generation of naive hopeful whites repeats the cycle anew instead of developing their *own* evolutionary potential. </p>
<p>Blacks seem to have strongly dominant genes for many regressive traits. If smart blacks want to make eugenics programs in Africa for their own people, good luck to them because it will be a costly and frustrating endeavor. Whites cannot be responsible for the evolutionary development of the black race. If we had not wasted 150 years on teaching the unteachable, we could be living in a Star Trek society by now. </p>

			<p>This is really beyond nauseating.  Now those exemplars of parental discipline, black parents (when they can be positively identified), have now lost control of their offspring due to application of white child-rearing standards?</p>
<p>Is nothing beyond the perfidy of whites in their efforts to destroy black society?  Certainly the evidence of advanced black Africans civilizations, with futuristic engineering and technological advancements, all stolen by the white devils, is irrefutable. </p>

<p>Stop being defensive. Open your eyes and look at the world and people around you and learn something. </p>
<p>Blacks are different from whites. Yes, whites to to blame for this mess because whites have persistently refused to accept that blacks are different. Yes, whites are to blame for being so shocked seeing black moms &#8220;whoop&#8221; their little black boys. Yes, whites are to blame for interfering in other races&rsquo; customs and removing what little controls and regulations blacks had in their own communities by disciplining their children in the way that worked for them. </p>
<p>Why are whites to blame? Whites remain the majority of this country. If whites screwed their heads on right and faced reality even when it offends their tender delicate and liberal sensibilities and most of all their narcissistic need to be the &#8220;Good Helpful Wise White Liberal Healers of the World&#8221;, we could have a society that accomplishes something. That is the first fact you must face, or you might as well go back and drink the Obama Kool Aid and cheer on the latest &#8220;stimulus&#8221; package and &#8220;free college tuition for crack dealing victims of society&#8221; program. </p>
<p>Blacks are not whites. You are useless until you set your ego down and acknowledge reality for what it is. </p>

			<p>Well obviously integration is a factor, in addition to IQ and hormone levels as far as black behavior goes.  Basically if blacks whipped their kids to the point where they behave consistently, illegitimacy could possibly go down to about 20% as a minimum, with genetics compensating for the rest.  To be honest, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing illegitimacy that low among whites these days..kinda shows you how low we have truly gone..</p>

			<p>it&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault.  Whip them or let them run wild, it&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>The true black way of raising kids is to ignore everything until things reach a point where a whupping is necessary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the IQ factor to be considered.  What works on 100 iqs won&rsquo;t work with 85 iqs.</p>

			<p>&#8221; The lack of understanding and preparation for adults prior to integration meant that children had unequal treatment in discipline and those for whom expectations were less, often black, ended up with discipline problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fails to mention the endless lawsuits against school districts that tried to discipline the black thugs who rampaged around beating whites and destroying the schools.</p>
