<h1>Shopping While Black</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Williams, Austin American-Statesman, April 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Highland Mall closed early on Saturday, a day when the Texas Relays were in town, &#8220;because the safety and security of our shoppers and retailers is our top priority,&#8221; according to an e-mail from the mall&rsquo;s general manager. Because the Texas Relays attract visitors who are mostly African American, the mall closing sends the message that Austin does not welcome their business. But the reaction from the blogosphere was mixed, with some defending the mall&rsquo;s action as prudent in the face of an unwelcome invasion of rowdy teenagers.</p>
<p>The struggle to racially integrate lunch counters in the 1960s made history. But equally important was the struggle to integrate shopping. The Highland Mall debacle shows that society is far from achieving that goal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The history of suburban malls is a history of intentional racial segregation. Even today, so-called desirable retail locations are characterized by limited access. Just try to reach The Domain on public transit. As Chris Rock observed, there are two kinds of malls: ones where white people shop and ones where white people used to shop.</p>
<p>One way that many stores show hostility to racial and ethnic minorities is through consumer racial profiling. Like racial profiling in police work, that involves detaining, searching and harassing such people more often than is done for whites, usually because they are suspected of stealing. {snip}</p>
<p>My research confirms that African Americans suffer discrimination in stores; middle-class whites, on the other hand, are privileged. We do not recognize this precisely because it is so customary. {snip} In my study, when white women didn&rsquo;t get what they wanted, many would shout, &#8220;I will never shop in this store again!&#8221;  &mdash;  and then they would be appeased. When African American customers shout or make a scene, managers call or threaten to call the police.</p>
<p>We have federal laws to protect people from racial discrimination in workplaces and public accommodations, but not in retail establishments. If we do not tolerate racism in our workplaces, restaurants or hotels, we certainly should not tolerate it in our stores.<br/>

			<p>A high school buddy of mine used to manage a local cheap chain grocery store&hellip;and yes, he kept his eye on &#8216;certain&rsquo; customers because those customers were always the ones that got caught stealing from the store. The owner of the chain had to close the store down in our town due to the sheer amount of shoplifting that was going on.</p>
<p>As a kid growing up, we used to go to the Mall of Memphis and Hickory Ridge Mall all the time, but its a sad reality that these places start to get overrun and whites don&rsquo;t feel safe at these places anymore. Now, the Mall of Memphis has been bulldozed to the ground and Hickory Ridge Mall is just a shadow of its former self.</p>

			<p>Is it any wonder?  In St. Louis, the malls on the decline are the ones that can be accessed by public transportation, the ones doing okay are the ones too far out for bus service.  If you&rsquo;re a St. Louisan, you know about the problems at the Galleria, a Richmond Heights cop was fired a few years ago for citing the light rail&rsquo;s new stop at the Galleria for bringing in black thugs.</p>

			<p>Mall owners have one primary goal, which is to make money. They really do not care what color of skin their customers have.  The fact that they would close their stores (and lose a day&rsquo;s profit) leads to one conclusion: a high number of African-Americans would result in massive shop lifting. It is not &#8220;racism,&#8221; it is common-sense.  </p>

			<p>One way that many stores show hostility to racial and ethnic minorities is through consumer racial profiling</p>
<p>I think the racial profiling reflects the products offered. In black communities hair braiding, check cashing establishments, and liquor stores proliferate. There is an inner city liquor store I went to one time (run by an Asian) and you put your money in a slot while the employee gets what you want behind bullet proof glass. </p>
<p>What the attitude of this article reflects is that white people are to forcibly integrate whether they want to or not while others can celebrate their separateness. </p>

<p>Some say this is unfair for the black shoppers who are honest, respectful and respectable; however, I would have more respect for these folks if, instead of crying racism, they did all that was within their power to correct the problems in their community that leads to such &#8220;consumer profiling.&#8221; How often do these people ever so much as argue against the criminal culture that is consuming their community? Hardly ever. Instead they just point the finger at the white community and cry racism, whenever they see white folks reacting reasonably to the uncivilized tendencies at the core of their own culture.</p>

			<p>This mall no doubt did not originally close early during this black celebration and has learned from that mistake. Over the years this mall discovered that staying open so that black teenagers can congregate and harrass shoppers was not financially prudent. That is what the ever-offended blacks and their white enablers can&rsquo;t seem to grasp.  Profit knows no race.  If the mall made money with no beatings, stabbing, shooting or looting they would gladly stay open.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen three instances of shoplifters being arrested and every shoplifer involved was a black or a few blacks.  The lists in our local suburban newspaper listing police activity usually contain at least 3 instances of shoplifting in the local mall.  The majority of the offenders are black.  Blacks shoplift, which is why they have so few stores in their ghettos. </p>

			<p>If blacks steal more than whites, which they do, then it makes sense to watch blacks more closely.  It is tough for those who don&rsquo;t steal (if there are any), but teaching children not to steal begins in their communities.  Again, he we see the problems of 70% of black children not having fathers.</p>

<p>Is the discrimination justified or not is the real question. If blacks are more apt to steal from retail stores then they only have themselves to blame for it. Funny how these articles are always written as if it is a proven fact that the races behave just alike.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Highland Mall debacle shows that society is far from achieving that goal. During the civil rights era, equal access to stores was high on the list of demands for racial justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>This woman is a professor, yet she can&rsquo;t even write an essay that could be considered above a high school level, making it blaringly apparent that she was awarded her entry into college and then passed and accredited by the same AA program.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for her.  No matter how much she clumsily traipses through idiotic, whining, baseless complaints, she will change absolutely nothing.  White people will still avoid violent behavior by blacks, so she really accomplishes nothing more than revealing the failure of the education system to educate blacks who it turns into sub-standard professors.</p>
<p>Anyone with half a brain would be condemning the conduct of people in their group for disgusting everyone to the point they can&rsquo;t stand being around them, because it gives them all a bad image.  But that calls for reasoning from an intellectual ability that blacks do not have, so they do only what they&rsquo;re capable of, which is to complain against people who are being wronged every day by violent, criminal behavior, instead of trying to correct such behavior.  <br/>

			<p>Visit Lafayette Mall on Indianpolis&rsquo; west side. </p>
<p>Once a flagship retail center of the Simons company, the multi-million dollar enclosed complex is little more than a ghost town.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Shop lifters, pick pockets, loud and obnoxious teens, racially-motiviated rudeness, whites being shaken down for money.</p>
<p>Washington Square Mall on the city&rsquo;s east side is now enduring the same downturn in business. It&rsquo;s where white people used to shop.</p>

			<p>What city in the U.S. with a population over 500,000 has not closed a mall because of black shoplifters? Is there anybody who has worked in retail serving a customer base that was over 10% black who disputes the allegation that blacks shoplift and are, in fact, upfront and proud about it? When your customer base exceeds 10% black, you are on your way out of business. It may take six months. It may take two years but once the trend starts it never reverses until the store closes and then blacks start all over somewhere else. All liberals should be sentenced to six months of employment at a store with significant black traffic.</p>

			<p>I used to work in a retail store in an overwhelmingly white suburb.  Only about 1% of our customers were black; yet, 100% of the people we caught shoplifting were black and at least 50% of the blacks who came into the store were caught shoplifting (No, this is NOT an exagerration).  <br/>
Yes, store workers do &#8220;profile&#8221; blacks.  It is common sense.  Particularly when they engage in certain suspect behavior.  For example, the most common method of shoplifting in our store was for a group of black women (usually with their teenage daughters) to come into the store carrying large purses, form a circle in a corner, and stuff clothes into their purses.  Whenever a group of black women entered the store, my manager (who was also black) told me to follow them around and pretend like I was folding clothes.  Without fail, I always either caught them stealing or they got really nervous and walked out of the store.  It was an eye opening experience.</p>

			<p>In my own of St Louis, you need only look at the decline of Northwest Plaza now that it has become the black &amp; hispanic mall to see the wonderful effects of shoplifting, criminal, and violent gangs of mostly black youth. Its barely even that now, even most blacks wont bother to go in there.  </p>
<p>Next up for the chopping block: St Louis Mills. St Louis Mills found out that shrinkage dramatically increased when they finally got a bus route in there. Of course, its not just the customers. The bus route allowed a larger number of blacks to be employed there, and much of the shrinkage is internal. The owner of the mall is already considering closing it.  The only bright side for the mall is the effect of hosting religious services on Sunday in the theater. It draws in otherwise well behaved people from suburbia that sometimes continue on to shop there after service. </p>
<p>Curiously enough, the theater at Northwest Plaza is trying to emulate this and has become a church.  Unfortunately for the mall, the theater is separate from the mall and unlikely to get anyone to shop there after services. </p>

			<p>If you want to keep Blacks from complaining about being ill-treated at your mall, it&rsquo;s helpful to assist the local Black ministers/activists to get rich.  Invest in a jumbo-sized strip mall with lots of fast food and Black oriented businesses, in partnership with the clergy.  Any Black who gripes about the White mall threatens the preachers&rsquo; profitable arrangements, and will not be able to rouse the &#8220;community&#8221;.  Trust the Black preachers to look out for themselves.  They know their congregations.  </p>

			<p>Of the nine female blacks I knew and worked with in college, nine of them stole from department stores at our local mall. Of all the whites I knew, none stole (or would confess/brag about it). They (the blacks) thought it was funny that I would not steal. Consequently I chose not to go &#8216;shopping&rsquo; at any time with any of them.</p>

One need look at the failure of every urban mall to understand the problem.</p>
<p>One of our suburban malls is now being overwhelmed by &#8216;city youth&rsquo;. The police and mall security are trying to keep order but it&rsquo;s only leading to more charges of racial profiling.</p>
<p>Once the boys and girls from the hood show up in ever increasing numbers, you know the days are numbered.</p>
<p>When blacks and hispanics move anywhere, the decline in unstoppable.</p>

<p>Rolling Acres Mall is closed?!  I&rsquo;m from Akron and I can remember when it opened, in the early &rsquo;80s I think it was. It was a great mall. I wasn&rsquo;t racially aware back then but now that I think about it the other area malls, like Chapel Hill, were starting to be overrun by blacks, hence the need for the Rolling Acres Mall.  Can anyone (and we know there are blacks monitoring this site) give me just one instance of where a White community has benefited from an influx of blacks, be it a mall, a school, a community pool - anything???!!!   </p>

			<p>You can tell a black &#8216;researched&rsquo; and wrote this article.  If this author was smarter, and we all know thats a challenge given his race, he would need to look at the official statistics.  Shoplifting based on race is skewed heavily on blacks.  In some locales, stores close up and move because the theft is of staggering proportions.  (i.e. food store chains in detroit :none!) A ex-army officer friend of mine got a job as a corporate chief of store security and concurred the race/theft stats.</p>

			<p>The annual football game between black colleges Florida A&M; and Bethune-Cookman (I call it the &#8220;Crime Bowl&#8221;) was played in Tampa for several years. So many businesses near the stadium closed during that weekend because of rampant black shoplifting and other crimes that the game moved to Orlando. Naturally, the crime has followed the event. I&rsquo;m hoping enough Orlando business owners will follow the Tampa lead and close for the weekend to send the game elsewhere, but it will take a major effort to overcome the ultra-PC city council. Even worse, the police chief and county sheriff are now black (wife &amp; husband, no less).</p>
<p>One bright spot: The annual Daytona Beach crime wave known as Black College Reunion has declined to a shadow of its former hideous self.</p>

			<p>Costs are higher in certain neighborhoods because in those neighborhoods, management has to pay for a full-time security guard at the electronic gates.  In operations such as grocery stores, very expensive store space (per square foot) by the entrance must be kept clear so that security has room to observe and chase.</p>

I now have another suggestion for an Amren article:</p>
<p>Make a list of all the malls in America that closed because of problems due to blacks.  It will be a long, eye-opening list. It will get a lot of attention because no one has published it before. </p>
<p>(The information will be verifiable by professionals in the real estate community, anonymously.)<br/>

			<p>Get real.  The whole paradigm of blacks, when shopping as with most anything else a person can do in society, is seen by them within their racial perpective they&rsquo;ve been spoonfed since birth.  That is a burden they carry and often make others share.  White people typically just see things without all the racial issues mixed in, which is how people should see things.  </p>
<p>So why would managers appease a white woman who yells that she&rsquo;ll never shop there again, but threaten to call the police or security if a black woman shouts the same thing?  Because a white woman would mean only just what she said, and nothing more, while a black woman would other things as well, along the general lines of reprisal/retribution.  Managers typically know when they can reason with a person and when they can&rsquo;t, and obviously the latter message is a lot harder to reason with, <br/>
and so they will choose wisely to do to best keep the business afloat, and won&rsquo;t need any superficial &#8220;studies&#8221; with all the PC predictable conclusions from biased no-nothing PC programmed automaton reserachers such as Christine Williams to tell them what they need to do.  </p>
<p>Oh&hellip;but the reprisal/retribution Christine Williams would face from other PC programmed &#8220;leaders&#8221; if she wrote along any other than the typical PC party line that blacks do no wrong and whites only discriminate unfairly when they treat blacks differently.    </p>

			<p>Social comment coming up!! Many years ago, it was the habit for all manufacturing plants in Glasgow to close completely at the same time for the two week annual holiday during the summer. This was very sensible as schools were on holiday too and other service businesses closed as the city was practically devoid of people. Gave time for essential maintenance and a lick of paint. However, in the north of England, coastal resorts such as Blackpool, Southport and Morecambe were very wary of &#8216;scots weeks&rsquo; and many boarding houses either closed or refused any bookings from scots. This was long before eMails and credit cards so bookings were made by letter and deposit cheques enclosed. Any from scotland were returned after a couple of weeks with a note saying the house was full. This delay ensured no other boarding house would be blighted. The behaviour of the scots was totally intolerable. They would drink from dawn to midnight and swear, fight, steal, push and shove everywhere, smash phone boxes and street lights and act like &#8216;animals&rsquo;. They even shut down the local dance hall on a peak saturday night with a well known live group on stage when about a hundred of these drunks squatted on the dance floor in front of the stage, drummed their heels and chanted &#8216;sco lund&rsquo;, threw coins at the band and everyone else for about an hour until the police were called and the hall closed. So the comments about this story have a familiar ring, but at least we who had businesses in these towns only had two weeks of &#8216;scottish&rsquo; weeks misery to deal with. I await denials from those who were not there.</p>

			<p>I used to live in Austin for more than 10 years and I still have relatives and friends there. Highland Mall used to be mostly white with some middle class blacks and hispanics. As in other places, a bus route was put in place that went to the mall. Gradually, more and more lower class blacks, mostly youths, started frequenting the mall, especially on weekends. It was long before the mall had to hire indoor off duty police officers to act as security. A lot of these black young people were loud, unruly and obnoxious. More and more whites started staying away. Then Austin became a sanctuary city and the Mexican illegals arrived in droves and began frequenting the mall. The mall became more and more &#8220;ghetto&#8221; and stores started closing or moving out to other places. Even middle class blacks and hispanics describe it as &#8220;ghetto.&#8221; Now it&rsquo;s mostly Mexican and while they aren&rsquo;t nearly as bad as the blacks, it&rsquo;s too late. The mall has lost so much business, it&rsquo;s closing at year&rsquo;s end.</p>

			<p>Back in the early 80&rsquo;s in downtown Detroit, they put on free concerts once a week at Hart Plaza. These were rock concerts. We could go downtown and listen to some live music at the riverfront. It was a real nice way to spend an afternoon. After several weeks of this, someone got the idea that something had to be done for the hiphop fans. After these hiphop shows, massive mobs of youths would all at once swarm into the Renaissance Center and wreak havoc. The free concerts ended soon after.</p>

			<p>I found at the deadmall.com the ST LOUIS CENTRE, which I visited in 2000, where there was Dillard&rsquo;s clearance shop, closed in the next year. As an European, I was rather surprised seeing such type of a mall downtown. Deadmall says two interesting things:</p>
<p><i><br/>
1. Shoppers avoided the area at night, and as a result 7:00 PM became the late closing for the Holiday Season, and the rest of the year the complex was closed each day by 6:00 PM.<br/>
2. Another issue for this mall is that Simon Properties defaulted on the loan and mall slumlord Haywood Whichard bought the mall for a bargain basement price. Since then, it has sat decaying with minimal occupancy.<i> </i></i></p>

			<p>Retailers are the most discriminating people in the world, they cannot bear to see the colour red on the balance sheet. I used to work for a retail chain, stores in depressed neighbourhoods had higher shrinkage, we stopped displaying razorblades, film and cosmetics there. We did notice one curious difference between the stores in the low and high rent districts. We could not sell the cheaper brands in the low rent districts, it had to be Tide or Pert, the most advertised products.</p>

			<p>I have seen this happen many times and in many places. As an example the Bannister Mall in Kansas City was one of the nicest malls you have ever been in. Then came the blacks, the crude insults to white females, the filthy street language, the intimidation of decent shoppers and now the mall is not only closed it has been bulldozed down. This is the rule, not the exception. blacks come from a mindset that for the most part will not work in a civilized society and pretending we can all assimilate is a joke.

			<p>A modest level of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; might actually encourage integration.  I don&rsquo;t mind the occasional well-dressed, well-behaved black people who shop at 12 Oaks (Novi, Mich.)  But when &#8220;civil rights advocates&#8221; raise hell because mall security people break up groups of young black males walking 4 or 5 abreast with a menacing swagger, well, guess what?  White people decide they could easily find better places to shop.  The Detroit Police used to &#8220;profile&#8221; groups of black youths in Greektown   &mdash;   kept the place civilized.

			<p>The same thing happens in England when the gypsies have thier annual &#8220;street festivals&#8221;. They come to small towns and commandeer the main street for a day of &#8220;culture&#8221;. Basically the adults bang their tambourines while the children decend on the shops stealing everything in sight. Of course the local law enforcement is overwhelmed and largely uninterested. Consequently the shops closed down and the town is empty on &#8220;gypsy day&#8221;  save for the owners guarding their locked shops.</p>
<p>  Lets be real here. No white, asian or latino wants to be anywhere near large crowds of blacks. Loud, obnoxious, harassing and unsafe for any non-thug looking person.

What is really going on here is a white leftist purposely stoking the unjustified resentment of black by saying black shoplifters are discriminated against and white shoppers are privileged. She should be sued as an instigator if there is any black on white violence at this mall in the next couple of weeks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In my study, when white women didn&rsquo;t get what they wanted, many would shout, &ldquo;I will never shop in this store again!&rdquo; &mdash; and then they would be appeased. When African American customers shout or make a scene, managers call or threaten to call the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because white women will make that statement and then angrily leave the store. Blacks on the other hand will throw a major scene or get agressive and there is no reasoning or placating them so managers must call the cops.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did notice one curious difference between the stores in the low and high rent districts. We could not sell the cheaper brands in the low rent districts, it had to be Tide or Pert, the most advertised products.&#8221;</p>

These teenagers weren&rsquo;t violent or bad but the whole place was filled with them and they&rsquo;d cruise around the mall trying to meet other teens and hanging out. Other shoppers stayed away. The stores started losing money. They got together and posted &#8220;no loitering&#8221; signs and hired security guards to enforce them and put up blocks in the parking lot to prevent cruising aroung the mall. The teens got the message and moved on. The shoppers returned.</p>

			<p>My wife has worked in retail almost all her adult life.  Of all groups, Blacks are the most likely to do the most outrageous things in the commission of attempting shoplifting or very obvious scams such as the returned item they just picked up from a display in the store.  In one case, after being caught and rejected from a clothing store, a Black mother waiting with her teenage kids for the store manager to get off work.  They then attacked her in broad daylight and beat her up.  No one tried to stop them and the police came too late, of course.</p>
<p>When we shop, we find that Blacks inevitbly use more isle space, stand around in everyone&rsquo;s way as if intentionally and expect YOU to get out of their way.  It&rsquo;s only become worse since Obama&rsquo;s election.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The annual football game between black colleges Florida A&M; and Bethune-Cookman (I call it the &ldquo;Crime Bowl&rdquo;) was played in Tampa for several years. So many businesses near the stadium closed during that weekend because of rampant black shoplifting and other crimes that the game moved to Orlando.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same thing with the Bayou Classic (or the &#8220;Watermelon Bowl&#8221;) played every year in New Orleans between &#8220;historically black&#8221; Grambling University and Southern University.  Half of the shops in the French Quarter shut down.  Every year they gripe on the local news about the racism of it all, but those shop owners know from experience it&rsquo;s a smart business decision, and the practice still continues.  This also happens at the annual &#8220;Essence Fest&#8221; in July, when hordes (more) of blacks come to town to listen to music, celebrate their blackness, and occasionally chimp out. </p>

<p>I want to thank &#8216;anonymous&rsquo; at 10:35 PM for that link.</p>
<p>I well remember when the Hawthorne mall was opened to great fanfare in 1977  &mdash;  described by deadmall.com as: </p>
<p>&#8221;..Built to revive the city of Hawthorne&hellip; as a renaissance to the city, one to lure people from shopping in Torrance and stay in the community&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The papers were full hope for this mall which opened DOA. The predictions were that this mall would lure White shoppers back to Hawthorne (HA!). But the reality was, as one &#8216;historian&rsquo; described it:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Within a day of the inevitable ribbon cutting, presided over, probably, by a grinning Mayor Guidi   &mdash;   this mall was overtaken by swaggering gang members. It was a clubhouse for them, and no shopper with any means at all would go there&hellip; The mall, and its adjoining parking structure, was a prime place for opportunistic criminals&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, it seems ALL malls in S. California are becoming overridden with loud obnoxious black/brown teens and other third worlders.  I expect the list of mall closures around here to accelerate as malls become more and more dangerous and customers and businesses flee.</p>

Is it a great historical achievement if a formerly segregated white lunch counter is now a currently segregated black lunch counter? Does the lunch counter even still exist or has it been boarded up for 35 years?

			<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of a relatively small town near Austin,and I spend quite a bit of time there. And I&rsquo;ve been in Highland Mall on several occasions,and the conditions are as described by the other poster who lived in Austin.</p>
<p>The hell of it is that back in the 1970&rsquo;s,I went to Highland Mall two or three times for high school academic competitions! Back then it was a great place,and especially so,given that I was an adolescent from a small farm and manufacturing town. That was one of the first times in my life that I got to see bright lights and the big city.</p>
<p>Not anymore. And what the author of the article neglected to mention was the mass chimpout that closed Highland Mall early during the Texas Relays either last year or the year before that.</p>
<p>Was I in the mall? Nope-but I happened to drive past the place about 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon,and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on,because the parking lot was almost completely empty,and there was barricade tape up in a few places. No reason for it that I could figure out,so I asked around.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m telling you is somewhat secondhand information,but I heard it from people who live and work close to that place. Seems that a large number of Texas Relays attendees congregated at the mall,and some sort of disturbance broke out. Along with shoplifting on a heroic scale,intimidation of legitimate patrons,and every other thing you might expect.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether it was the Austin PD,mall management,individual merchants,mall security,or some combination  of these people who made the decision to just shut the place down for the afternoon,but however it was done,that decision was made.</p>
<p>So,on a pleasant spring afternoon,in a large city in the southern part of the United States,a bunch of grownups realized that trying to deal with a mass of black male teenagers without resorting to massive use of force is probably not possible,and definitely not doable in the confines of an enclosed merchant establishment. And the grownups very sensibly said,&#8221;To Hell With It&#8221;,and locked the place up and went home for the day.</p>

			<p>Made me laugh! I don&rsquo;t respond well with the &#8220;blacks must have right of way in the aisle game&#8221;! I simply stop right there- no movement at all. They get confused and don&rsquo;t know quite how to respond. It shakes them up a bit, but then they walk around me! Works every time. Maybe they assume I am stopping to look at something in the aisle of the store? Maybe I am not &#8220;dissing&#8221; them by stopping? I don&rsquo;t know, but it works for me. Another story of the &#8220;PC police&#8221; at work: We had a lovely breakfast and lunch cafe in St Cloud, here in Florida. I lived there roughly four years ago. This place was always packed with a line waiting to get in. You would NEVER see a black in there- EVER. The name of this lovely establishment? The Kissimmee Koffee Kafe! After years of operating peacefully, something happened, someone reported it- not sure. But it ended up being renamed the Kissimmee Kafe. Still busy, but now I have seen blacks in it. Just not many! </p>

			<p>Living 1 mile down the road from Northwest Plaza here in St.Ann, suburb of St. Louis, I have watched it go down in the last 10+ years. Now it&rsquo;s supposed to be redeveloped to bring back shoppers. A plan is supposed to be in the works, though when they plan to start is up in the air. The problem is, no one will admit the main reason that it went down the tubes is the influx of the black youth and rude adults. That would  bring the &#8220;race card&#8221; out fast. Till that problem is addressed, my shopping is done out at Mid Rivers, even if it is 14 more miles down the road. Sorry to hear that St. Louis Mills is going the same way, its only been open for about 4 years I think. </p>

			<p>As usual this intrepid Austin Statesman reporter reminds us that we, as middle class whites, are &#8220;privileged&#8221; and can&rsquo;t begin to fathom the discrimination and indignities suffered by blacks at shopping malls.  As with black spring break and other all black celebrations, when blacks congregate in large numbers there is always trouble ranging from property damage, to assault and even murder as we all know. Wonder why these facts didn&rsquo;t make it into this article?  </p>
<p>Reading this article a space alien would think blacks are are as law abiding as whites but for their black skin color are treated differently at shopping centers.  My sister worked retail in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s and about 75% of the shoplifters were black.  It&rsquo;s hard not to profile when 3 out of 4 shoplifters are black.</p>
<p>This is just another propaganda piece masquerading as investigative journalism.  </p>

			<p>Anti-white black racism includes shoplifting in white-owned stores.  Blacks behave abusively and then demand respect.  That doesn&rsquo;t work, but they keep on doing it and it will only escalate as the black population increases and the deplorable Africanization of America increases.</p>

			<p> In the 1970s my father was a manager at one of the anchor stores (and had a board position with mall mgmt. as well) at Northwest Plaza in St. Louis (actually, St. Ann), Mo. He was a race realist and I was a high school kid and know it all supporter of equality and black culture. He&rsquo;s been dead over 20 years and I wish I could tell him how sorry I am for making fun of him for not regarding the blacks as equals.  </p>
<p> The reality is that the percentage of blacks that shoplift, vandalize, and wreak havoc is colossal. No business but the ghetto merchant can operate in these circumstances very long. </p>
<p> My own children are working at a mall in Kansas City (actually Overland Park, KS) now and they are seeing this as the mall gradually darkens. Already several choice merchants have decided not to renew there for the coming five year cycle and that means the mall will probably be bulldozed, as several others in the last 10 years have in this metro area, all of which went mostly black in the preceding five years.</p>

			<p>I remember seeing a video taken after hurricane Kartina. Two black female police officers filling their carts at an abondoned Walmart. In Kansas City they literally killed the Indian Springs, Blue Ridge &amp; Bannister Malls. Now they have spread to the Independence Center &amp; Bolger Square shopping centers. Many people I know have just quit shopping in these areas and go Johnson Co. Kansas to spend their money. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Not anymore. And what the author of the article neglected to mention was the mass chimpout that closed Highland Mall early during the Texas Relays either last year or the year before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the far leftist Austin paper didn&rsquo;t print this. They certainly would have had it been white teens. What they also didn&rsquo;t publish was last year, at the Texas Relays on 6th, gunfire broke out on 2 occasions. I knew someone that worked as a bouncer and witnessed it first hand. He said he dived back into the club and barricaded the door. There were also other disturbances. The newspaper never reported this either. I would have never know had it been for knowing someone who worked  down there. Then this year, the newspaper ran an article saying it was racist to have police sharpshooters on the tops of buildings and so many police and that they didn&rsquo;t to it when whites were there. Also, this year, a black shoved a young white man to the ground, he hit his head and dies. If it had been the reverse, it would have been a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>
