								<h2><a href="http://www.ktar.com/?nid=6&amp;sid=1117013">Arpaio Calls Resignation Demands &lsquo;Ridiculous&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>KTAR-FM (Phoenix), April 8, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio says calls for his resignation because of alleged racial profiling are &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; and that he will never step down. </p>
<p>The resignation demands came Tuesday from the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the national Action Network, and Bertha Lewis, CEO and chief organizer of the social activist group ACORN. They accused Arpaio of racial profiling in his enforcement of immigration laws. Sharpton said Arpaio is carrying out &#8220;a reign of terror&#8221; with alleged civil and human rights violations. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton said if Arpaio does not resign, he will hold a protest march next month in Phoenix. </p>
<p>Arpaio responded, &#8220;If they want to come down here, be my guest.&#8221; </p>
<p>Arpaio said he is doing nothing wrong and an investigation, announced last month by the Justice Department, will clear him. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Responding to allegations that he pursues suspected illegal immigrants on misdemeanors in an effort to determine their immigration status, Arpaio said, &#8220;Police go after misdemeanors all the time. Fifty-one percent of the people in my jails, booked by all cops, are misdemeanors. So why is everybody talking about going after violent crime? Everybody doesn&rsquo;t go after just violent crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sharpton, issuing his resignation demand in New York, said that, under Arpaio&rsquo;s immigration enforcement policies, &#8220;Any one of color is being pulled over and harassed. People are being made to carry their citizenship papers around. And that&rsquo;s racial profiling.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sharpton also called for an end to the 287G program, under which local law enforcement officers are authorized to enforce federal immigration laws. </p>
<p>Reaction to Sharpton&rsquo;s statements by Valley minority leaders was mixed. </p>

			<p>If we had more principled men like this fighting the race-racketeers we wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as bad off today as we currently are.</p>
<p>I wish I had such a local sheriff protecting me and my family from illegal criminals.</p>

			<p>This will turn out to be VERY interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>The Rev. has been threatning, intimidating and bullying people for a long time, but taking on Sheriff Joe, I think he&rsquo;ll meet someone who WON&#8221;T back down.</p>
<p>Wish we had a President or even a Senator like him!</p>

			<p>Al Sharpton doesn&rsquo;t realize that his kind of people are hurt most acutely by the presence of these millions of &#8220;guest workers&#8221; and &#8220;guest welfare clients.&#8221;  Then again, he doesn&rsquo;t care, he&rsquo;s got his, and to hades with everyone else.  All he really cares about is electing Democrats on a national basis, and that helps him.</p>

			<p>  There is a sheriff in Butler County, Ohio just like Sheriff Joe. His name is Richard Jones. God bless both these great men. We need to stand behind these men and cover their backs. They are the last defense against tyranny in this country. Sharpton is a joke, a very bad one indeed.</p>

			<p>     Sheriff Joe is safe for now, but wait until the national media get a hold of this and do their usual hatchet job on him. They&rsquo;ll make it look like he is kidnapping illegals and putting them in concentration camps. I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;ll even show some pictures of Hitler&rsquo;s ovens and superimpose a picture of Joe standing by the door with a shovel in his hands. Newspapers wonder why they are going broke and tv news (?) programs wonder why viewership is down. I think they took on the wrong man this time. Joe will tell them to shove it where the sun don&rsquo;t shine.</p>

			<p> People are being made to carry their citizenship papers around. And that&rsquo;s racial profiling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>FYI Mr. Al, the U.S. is the only country I have been in (of many) in which one need not have I.D. and proof of residency or legal visa ON HIS/HER person AT ALL TIMES. In those countries, to be caught without said papers is a guaranteed trip to jail until you can get those papers/documents delivered to you IN JAIL!! If there are countries that do not require this, let me know since I actually haven&rsquo;t been to ALL of the countries</p>

			<p>Sharpton won&rsquo;t do anything. He is nothing but a bully and won&rsquo;t take on anyone who might actually stand up to him. He is used to  dealing with easily cowed grovelers. He&rsquo;ll make a lot of noise then slink away. </p>

			<p>Al Sharpton and his ilk are nothing more than instigators and race-baiters.</p>
<p>Gotta love how people whine about how Arpaio treats prisoners.  Well, here&rsquo;s an idea  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t want to do the time, don&rsquo;t do the crime!  Prison is not much of a deterrent if you get to have all sorts of fun and games while you&rsquo;re there.</p>

			<p>If most blacks had any sense they would realize Sharpton, instead of supposedly speaking for them is their worst enemy. Illegals directly compete with black for scores of jobs. Illegals who are mostly Mexicans look with distain on blacks. Sharpton is either dumb, misguided or uncaring about the problems of blacks. All he wants is the spotlight. And I feel sorry for blacks as Sharpton seems to be their most prominent or most vocal spokesman. </p>

			<p>There is hope for us all if this sheriff is a current and future role model for all American citizens as his letter shows he is.  Let us hope that Al Sharpton organises his demonstration, with official local permission of course,and all US citizens turn out to support their local sheriff, with many more &#8220;bussed&#8221; in from other areas as I would expect Sharpton to do with the potential violence that Sharpton would bring.  It would be a good publicity event to show all America (especially Pres. BHO) and the world what the facts are about the attempted in-progress fifth column takeover of the USA.</p>

It&rsquo;s always great to hear someone take on these bullies but WHEN has anyone of these guys ever stood firm?</p>
<p>I want to believe that Sheriff Arpaio is a man of convictions but after a couple days of presumably backroom arm twisting, these guys always cave.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s political pressure or efforts to expedite a resolution or threats or capitulation but I&rsquo;ve seen it too many times to believe the Sheriff is going to stick to him guns.</p>
<p>The past is prologue and I&rsquo;ve seen too many (well, ever one) of these guys eventually apologize and beg forgiveness.</p>

			<p>OK, I am going to let people here in on some deeply, deeply held secrets, only a handful of people know these secrets.</p>
<p>1) Al Sharpton - he really isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;Reverend&#8221;, he&rsquo;s a race hustler, media manipulator - and this is going to shock a lot of people here.</p>
<p>His huge civil rights movement against the White Duke Lacrosse Team for raping a Black girl - this was all a lie, there was no rape, even though it was put on Newsweek Magazine as a fact - a horrible racist hate crime, it was a hoax and Sharpton was promoting this hoax.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all!</p>
<p>Those few of us in the know, understand that Al Sharpton led another huge racial hustler/hoax in the Tawany Brawley racist rape hoax, yeah another one!</p>
<p>Al Sharpton used his fake &#8220;reverend&#8221; credentials and media connections to get some of the Black Central Park wilding rapist off and&hellip; huge secret here, these Blacks convicted of raping and beating a White female jogger very close to death&hellip;.</p>
<p>They were guilty!</p>
<p>Want some other secrets?</p>
<p>Jessie Jackson - he&rsquo;s not a real &#8220;reverend&#8221; either - his tax exempt organization = Operation PUSH - People United to Save Humanity - It&rsquo;s not legit! He isn&rsquo;t really going to SAVE HUMANITY, he&rsquo;s out for himself and his family - shaking down businesses and politicians, scamming the tax payers for $$s.</p>
<p>You heard it here folks - deep secrets, Al Sharpton - not a real &#8220;reverend&#8221;.</p>

			<p>There are many in the race-hustling community that see a grand alliance of all &#8220;people of color&#8221; to fight whitey. How black leaders can fail to see the threat to blacks from Hispanic mass migration amazes me. Hispanics hate blacks more than they hate whites but they will use them to pass legislation. Once amnesty is granted and the blacks outlast their usefulness to La Raza its anyone&rsquo;s guess what happens.</p>

<p>I applaud Sherriff Joe&rsquo;s principled stand. But on this occasion I don&rsquo;t think it will even be needed to thwart Sharpton. Sharpton&rsquo;s followers are of course not brown but BLACK   &mdash;   of which there are mercifully few in Arizona. (Even Richard Pryor noted this in his comedy act. Well, not the &#8220;mercifully&#8221; part.) </p>
<p>And although the Desert State&rsquo;s mestizos would certainly show up in numbers for a rally organized by their fellow mestizos, I don&rsquo;t believe very many browns will turn out for an event run by a weird-looking black man from some other part of the country. Sharpton has power and influence over Africans and a few white wackos   &mdash;   but Mexicans? </p>
<p>Does the average unilingual-Spanish border-jumper in the SW even know his name? </p>

			<p>The fact that a fraud like Sharpton has any credibility in the MSM, and the country in general, shows how depraved we as a society have become.  Too bad more politicians do not have the character of this sheriff.  On the other hand, I think most whites realize that Sharpton is dangerous, anti-intellectual, and a buffoon, but are afraid to say anything for fear of being labeled &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When PC hit the campuses in the late 80&rsquo;s it had an immediate impact on me that I wasn&rsquo;t able to make sense out of at first.  Kind of like an attack. You&rsquo;re too busy being in it to figure out what has happened to you.  Well, we have been attacked alright.  But, in a way, we should have seen this coming. Fact is, we didn&rsquo;t, though, fortunately, we now do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Soft Totalitarian approach.  They shoot us down figuratively, though, in essence, with the same objective in mind, ie; to eliminate us.  They are trying to eliminate basic self-interest in the minds of all Whites, especially White men.<br>
Their methods and way of life is thoroughly ignoble and cowardly, of that there is NO doubt.  They use a right provided for them by White men and like theives and liars who break promises WHILE they make them, steal it from us, project their guilt (by saying WE are the theives who stole land, revealing their historical ignorance in the process) and hog the Free Speech for themselves, not so they can learn and grow as human beings, that is the last thing they are interested in, or capable of.  No, the do it so they can place themselves above criticism where they are free to manipulate facts, deify themselves and, correspondingly, demonize dissent.  All for the purpose of eliminating any and all opposition.  <br>
They are aggressively trying to eliminate Self-Interest and, therefore, Self-Preservation. Anyone who refuses in any way will be beaten down, as an attacker beats down any attempt from its victim to defend itself.  It&rsquo;s that simple.<br>
You can no more appeal to the Humanity of an Al Sharpton (as the good Sheriff does in paragraphs 4,5, and 8) than you can an attacker who is out to kill you. They don&rsquo;t have any Humanity to appeal to. As the cowardly silence of John Conyers made perfectly obvious.<br>
Sooner or later we will arrive at a stage where the only way to deal with them is to fight back.  But to do that we have to organize.  And to be well organized we have to be in possession of basic facts and their consequences. Sites like AR, VDARE and others are a good place to start.<br>

<p>Yes, there is a lot of truth to your post, but I think it reflects more on our Gangster Culture then it does on the lack of moral fiber of men like the Sheriff.  And make no mistake about it, we have been a Gangster Culture now for nearly a century.  <br>
I have been posting about this at different places for a while now.  I think the Power Elite systematically terrorizes those who might say something that will inspire organized revolt.  <br>
What else explains the bizarre spectacle of a person who has had a loved one murdered only to come out in praise of - The Murderers!!!!<br>
Yes, we all know that in some cases some people are sincere about such praise, but that&rsquo;s because they are thoroughly brainwashed.  Fact is, a lot of people are NOT!  Those are the ones who I am convinced are pressured or threatened into making remarks they would make if they were allowed to speak their minds.  <br>
Perhaps in some cases there is even some compensation (bribery) involved. <br>
Either way, it&rsquo;s behavior consistent with the Gangster Culture and as such represents one of the more important symptoms of the sick, twisted, Inverted World, we live in today.<br>

			<p>Just to confirm a number of the posts here, I&rsquo;ve been hearing about anti=white racial solidarity  (with the Asians thrown in for good measure) from blacks for decades now.  In college, the blacks would speak with glee about the coming &#8220;people of color&#8221; conquest of America.  Problem is, neither the Asians, nor the Latinos (in upstate New York, mostly Dominican and Puerto Ricans) have much regard or affinity for black people, and most aspire to white culture, neighborhoods, and as friends and colleagues.  At most, they feel sorry for them, but don&rsquo;t really respect them.</p>

			<p>Everyone should read up on Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He is Italian-American originally from Springfield, Massachusetts and has made some very good programs for the inmates in Arizona. He made an outdoor jail called &#8220;Tent City&#8221; to save taxpayer money, where the inmates wear clownish pink uniforms. His philosophy is that jail should not be the Ritz/Carlton. </p>
<p>I have a new hero. Finally, someone willing to stand up to the clown squad and stop the crybaby liberal politics where criminal inmates are treated better than tax paying Americans. </p>

			<p>If only White people would learn to stand their ground and refuse to apolgize or grovel things would get a lot better. Jackie Mason was in trouble a few weeks ago for using a name to describe BHO but he stood his ground and the racist winbags burned themselves out. Same thing for Ann Coulter, I have yet to see her apologize or grovel &amp; she seems to be doing just fine. The race baiters soon learn that it is futile to demand an apology. Lets hope the Sheriff takes note of this.</p>

			<p>The most frustrating thing about this, besides the self-injection of riot-inciting(Freddie&rsquo;s Fashion Mart) Sharpton, is the fact that so-called &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; is indeed a necessary part of good law enforcement work, and has been proven so over and over again, yet police officials and beat cops continually are forced to deny engaging in it for political-correctness/public relations reasons.</p>
<p>When there is justice, finally, on this and similar topics, police and politicians and media figures will simply state frankly that criminal profiling with race as an element is a statistical imperative and one of the best tools for fighting crime that society can implement, and does, and should.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure Sheriff Joe is supported and defended from predatory race-hustlers like Sharpton.  </p>
<p>There must be sufficient pushback against this type of decades-old, brazen anti-white aggression in the public sphere to the point where the lives of people like Sharpton are ruined when they attempt it just as much and as often as the lives of all the honest white men that they&rsquo;ve ruined over the years. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m finally glad to see someone standing up to the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Al Sharpton. In addition to Sheriff Arpaio&rsquo;s willingness to confront slick little Al, there&rsquo;ll be a demographic that Sharpton&rsquo;s not used to&hellip;unfriendly white people who are sick and tired of immigrant-related crime. </p>
<p>Sharpton&rsquo;s hackneyed race-baiting will gain no traction in a jurisdiction like Maricopa County. He&rsquo;ll huff and he&rsquo;ll puff, then (as one astute poster has already noted) he&rsquo;ll run out of steam. Unfortunately for him (Sharpton that is), Sheriff Arpaio is legitmately enforcing current laws, with the full backing of the citizens who continually re-elect him. </p>
<p>From my point of view though, the most damning part of this whole event is the relative silence of everyone else. My fellow posters and I know that in a thousand living rooms all across Arizona, average, hard-working, tax-paying citizens are shaking their fists in support of Sheriff Arpaio. </p>
<p>I can only hope that if Sharpton shows up to wreak his usual fact-less chaos, those supportive citizens will turn out in kind to stand behind their sheriff. </p>

			<p>I agree with the poster who says that Al Sharpton isn&rsquo;t really a &#8220;reverend.&#8221; He just uses that title in front of his name because he thinks it will pull at people&rsquo;s heartstrings and lure them into believing that any of his undertakings must be &#8220;noble&#8221; and &#8220;just.&#8221; The same goes for the &#8220;reverend&#8221; Jesse Jackson. Quite frankly, i can&rsquo;t remember that last time either have said anything pertaining to religion while in the public spotlight.</p>

			<p>Illegals who are mostly Mexicans look with disdain on blacks.</p>
<p>So too do the real muslims in Kuwait and Saudi who think blacks are good for nothing but cannon fodder and slave labor!! yet the silly black converts to muslim don&rsquo;t seem to know that.</p>

			<p>What can Al Sharpton do in response. Sheriff Arapo has no intention of attempting to silence him. Arapo&rsquo;s smart enough to know that provoking or arresting Sharpton on anything short of a major crime would be a mistake. His response of &#8220;enjoy Pheonix but don&rsquo;t think I care about you&#8221; is something that Sharpton is honestly not prepared for. </p>

			<p>I am amazed that dinosaur from another time still has credibility. For a man involved for so long in politics and social issues, he has no memorable accomplishments to speak of, except to sow discord and fictions. The title of &#8220;reverend&#8221; is about the highest he can aspire to (which anyone can easily acquire) and he even falls short of that. He is little more than another charlatan capitalizing on the currents of American society. Really, what has any black really done for the civil rights movement? The whole process was driven by a bunch of white boys, starting with JFK and LBJ and all the good &#8216;ole boys in congress. They ordered the National Guard to enforce the civil rights laws they passed, not the NAACP, et. al. Minorities got their seat at the table, but that&rsquo;s not enough. They want the whole goose. And that without doing any of the work.</p>
<p>Let Al buzz about like the proverial fly. And then let the good sheriff do his part to clean this pile up. We should elevate his department to a training center for other law enforcement agencies. How about we make him the chief of Homeland Security?  We&rsquo;d need quite a few more acres somewhere, lots of chain link fence material, razor wire, electric lines, and a whole bunch of army surplus cots and tents, and, oh yes, lots of pink dye (for the undies) and baloney (for the sandwiches.)</p>
<p>It is obvious the reason Al Sharpton, et. al. don&rsquo;t like Sheriff Joe Arpaio is because he is effective - highly effective. He is therefor subject to their standard practice of unfounded accusations. It is a smokescreen designed to deflect attention from the real issue and create a mirage for an often uninformed public - a public generally incapable of even the most rudimentary form of rational analysis.</p>
<p>Thankfully that may be changing. The economic downturn has heightened public awareness of the impact illegal alien migration and immigration. No greater motivator than necessity. Everyone who supports Sheriff Arpaio should make that known to their senators and representatives. We have a wild and wacky Congress right now, but we need to make it known to them that if this Congress missteps on this issue, we will pick another at the first opportunity. Remember 1/3 of the Senate and ALL of the House are up for &#8220;renewal&#8221; every two years.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about former drug dealer Al Sharpton (it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly the media &#8216;forgot&rsquo; about the video showing Al making drug deals back in the day). One the Marxist string pullers who control him will assign several young &#8220;staff members&#8221; to write an answer that will be filled with lies and roundabout excuses. But it will be written in proper English, something Al is incapable of. </p>

			<p>A clash of titans, if ever there was one!! They both have reached the human limit of self agrandizment and self deception.<br>
     Only Joe could out outrage Rev Al. The City of Phoenix should charge admission to watch the media farce that will come upon us. Joe holding forth at his tent jail and forcing inmates to emulate Cool Hand Luke; Al sweating like a pig outside a black church offering sanctuary to a bemused Mexican bean picker.<br>
     I hope the entire freak show degenerates into a full blown riot with Joe and Al ending up in the same hospital room with broken heads. If the black race  considers Al their Paladin and the white race considers Joe it`s champion, the Asians will soon be ordering both groups around.<br>
