<h1>Mpls. Pays Settlement to Black Officers in Bias Suit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Chanen, Minneapolis Star Tribune, April 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Minneapolis agreed Friday to pay five high-ranking black officers $740,000 to settle a lawsuit they filed in 2007, alleging racial discrimination and a hostile working environment.</p>
<p>Lt. Don Harris, Lt. Medaria Arradondo and Sgt. Charlie Adams each will receive $187,000, Lt. Lee Edwards $137,000, and Sgt. Dennis Hamilton $40,000.</p>
<p>The settlement, which includes the plaintiffs&rsquo; legal fees, does not mandate that the city change any policies or practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of the settlement is extremely significant in race discrimination [cases] in the state, especially against a public entity,&#8221; John Klassen and Andrew Muller, attorneys for the plaintiffs, said in a joint statement. &#8220;The Police Department hasn&rsquo;t [ever] paid this amount in an employment discrimination case, to our knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five officers sued the city and police Chief Tim Dolan in December 2007, alleging a history of discrimination in the department and asserting that it became more institutionalized after Dolan became chief. The five had an average length of service of 20 years.</p>
<p>The suit focused on three personnel moves by Dolan: the reassignment of Harris and Edwards to lower positions, and the transfer of Adams from the homicide unit. The city already has paid Adams an $85,000 settlement over comments Dolan made after the transfer.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Minneapolis City Council rejected a $2 million settlement offer. Friday, the council voted 12-1 to approve the $740,000 settlement. Lisa Goodman voted no. A trial had been set for March 2010.</p>
<p><b>Labeled &#8216;disgruntled cops&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Our settlement doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge any discrimination, but we want to put these allegations behind us,&#8221; said council President Barb Johnson. &#8220;The Police Department has already made changes to address some of the issues raised and will continue to work to improve the climate. We were happy to move forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The department had only one officer of color with a rank higher than lieutenant when the suit was filed, but Dolan has since promoted two more. About 18 percent in the department are officers of color.</p>
<p>The suit claimed that black officers received fewer opportunities for training, special duty and overtime, as well as fewer appointments to key units. It also claimed that the department had failed in several areas of diversity required by a mediation agreement reached with the help of the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While several white homicide officers got more than 150 hours overtime during the Interstate 35W bridge collapse, no one informed Adams of that opportunity until the last days of the detail, the suit said. The department fired Hamilton for infractions that didn&rsquo;t get white officers fired, the suit said.</p>
<p>The department demoted Edwards, former head of the homicide unit and an inspector, after accusing him of driving a department vehicle intoxicated and making offensive comments to subordinates. But the suit said the department then replaced Edwards temporarily with a white lieutenant with a lengthy history of civil rights violations.<br>

			<p>&#8220;$740,000 to blacks claiming racial discrimination and &ldquo;hostile working environment.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And there are those of us who hope the government there collapses economically because of giving in to these whining crybabies.  And the extra burden of paying frivolous lawsuits should just about be the proverbial straw.<br>

<p>This is exactly the sort of incentive these blacks need to bring lawsuits, the fact that the Whites will crumble, pay them, keep them hired and promote them, all the while kissing their behinds.</p>

<p>This line is a dead give-away. It shows that all they were after was a pay-off. If they were so mistreated, why no demand that changes be made so that it doesn&rsquo;t happen to anyone else? Also, if no changes are going to be made, then they city must not be admitting any guilt. Therefore if they are not guilty, why the pay-off? Basically, city officials are giving away other people&rsquo;s money&hellip;for nothing. </p>

			<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is a cut and dry case of racial discrimination. Tell me a white officer wouldn&rsquo;t have been fired for driving his squad car drunk. </p>

So, once again the racial extortion pays off and these guys just scored a jackpot to go away.</p>

			<p>this sets a terrible message and will encourage only further questionable lawsuits. <br>
i live in la. and when they elected mayor nagin approximately 50 white city employees were terminated and replaced with black ones - clearly a case of flagrant racial discrimination. the person who did the firing even admitted it, thinking he could get by with it. the white employees filed a joint lawsuit - and won. why it didn&rsquo;t make national news is more evidence of media bias.<br>
p.s. sorry for the absent caps and funky punctuation. my keyboard is fouled up from getting wet.</p>

			<p>There is one simple solution to the never ending bogeyman of &#8216;racism&rsquo;: freedom of association.</p>
<p>Give white people the CHOICE of who they live around. Allow white people to have our own all white states in the U.S., and all the &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites who simply prefer being around their own people (which would be 99% of us), would move to those all white states. Any whites who CHOSE to remain living among non-whites would clearly not be &#8216;racist&rsquo;, and therefore the poor, hard done by non-whites who lived with them would never again experience &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; or &#8216;racism&rsquo;. </p>
<p>But strangely enough, no non-whites want this. They can&rsquo;t seem to leave us whites alone, yet they constantly complain about how we dislike them.</p>
<p>The next time some idiotic liberal calls you a &#8216;racist&rsquo;, offer them my simple solution to the problem, and see if they can even begin to comprehend it.</p>
