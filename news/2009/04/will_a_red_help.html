<h1><a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=94771">Will a &#8216;Red&rsquo; Help Blacks Go Green?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Klein, WorldNetDaily, April 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man appointed as a special environmental adviser to the White House recently was as an admitted radical communist and black nationalist leader.</p>
<p>Van Jones, president and founder of Green For All, a nonprofit organization that advocates for building a so-called inclusive green economy, has been tapped to serve as the special adviser for green jobs, enterprise and innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. According to the White House blog, Jones&rsquo; duties will include helping to craft job-generating climate policy and ensuring equal opportunity in the administration&rsquo;s energy proposals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll work with anybody, I&rsquo;ll fight anybody if it will push our issues forward,&#8221; [Jones] told the left-leaning East Bay Express in a 2005 interview. &#8220;I&rsquo;m willing to forgo the cheap satisfaction of the radical pose for the deep satisfaction of radical ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a green wave coming, with renewable energy, organic agriculture, cleaner production,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Our question is: Will the green wave lift all boats? That&rsquo;s the moral challenge to the people who are the architects of this new, ecologically sound economy. Will we have eco-equity, or will we have eco-apartheid? Right now we have eco-apartheid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones was a founder and leader of the communist revolutionary organization Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM.</p>
<p>STORM worked with known communist leaders. It led the charge in black protests against various issues, including a local attempt to pass Proposition 21, a ballot initiative that sought to increase the penalties for violent crimes and require more juvenile offenders to be tried as adults.</p>
<p>The leftist blog Machete 48 identifies STORM&rsquo;s influences as &#8220;third-worldist Marxism (and an often vulgar Maoism).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking to the East Bay Express, Jones said he first became radicalized in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots, during which time he was arrested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By August, I was a communist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>STORM eventually fell apart amid bickering amongst its leaders.</p>
<p>Jones then moved on to environmentalism. He used his Ella Baker Center to advocate &#8220;inclusive&#8221; environmentalism and launch a Green-Collar Jobs Campaign, which led to the nation&rsquo;s first Green Jobs Corps in Oakland, Calif.</p>
<p>At the Clinton Global Initiative in 2007, Jones announced the establishment of Green For All, which in 2008 held a national green conference where most attendees were black. Jones also released a book, &#8220;The Green Collar Economy,&#8221; which debuted at No.12 on the New York Times&rsquo; bestseller list  &mdash;  the first environmental book written by an African American to make that list.</p>
<p>His appointment as a White House environmental adviser was announced on March 10.</p>
<p>White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Nancy Sutley announced, &#8220;Van Jones has been a strong voice for green jobs, and we look forward to having him work with departments and agencies to advance the President&rsquo;s agenda of creating 21st century jobs that improve energy efficiency and utilize renewable resources. Jones will also help to shape and advance the administration&rsquo;s energy and climate initiatives with a specific interest in improvements and opportunities for vulnerable communities.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;The man appointed as a special environmental adviser to the White House recently was as an admitted radical communist and black nationalist leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt this administration has the most extreme radicals in the country, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure they will all be converging into one big crash in the next couple of years for various reasons besides the economy.</p>
<p>Right now, with the power drive gaining momentum on the right with tea parties organized, police and military uniting in a citizen support organization, militias organizing once again, and so many new people buying guns in the last several months (The FBI says they&rsquo;ve processed 7 million applicants for background checks.), and gun warehouses running out of ammo for sale, requiring ninety-day back orders, it appears as if the backlash to the messiah&rsquo;s appointment of such a crusty bunch of Marxist oddballs will very likely be quite a potent force as we get further along into this administration&rsquo;s time in office.</p>
<p>I notice that the the messiah&rsquo;s campaign managers at the three major networks and CNN, who are trying to pass themselves off as reporters,  are just now beginning to besmirch all these reactions by announcing what extremists they must be if they believe this country will crash, even though there&rsquo;s overwhelming evidence it will do so for certain.</p>
<p>Their one main trick is to attempt to marginalize everyone as extremists, which they&rsquo;ve been doing now fervently for three months.  That will backfire badly on them.</p>

I&rsquo;m torn by todays environmentalists. I&rsquo;m all for cleaner air, cleaner water, and a cleaner environment but I don&rsquo;t like the radical turn this movement has taken.</p>
<p>These people seem to believe that all these proposed environmental solutions such as solar and wind energy are fully perfected and that the only reason we don&rsquo;t have them in place is because the government and corporations are preventing their implementation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say you believe in renewable, clean energy, it&rsquo;s another thing to make the physics work.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones is clearly a radical black trying to use the environmental issue to hammer the government and corporations to implement a racial black-marxist agenda. </p>
<p>&#8216;If you don&rsquo;t promote clean energy, you&rsquo;re a racist. If you don&rsquo;t promote saving the environment, you&rsquo;re a racist. If you don&rsquo;t believe what I believe and do what I say, you&rsquo;re a racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really frustrating for me is that people like him are going to be seen as the spokesmen and visionaries for the environment. All he&rsquo;s doing is co-opting a legitimate issue for himself.</p>
<p>Like I always say to the far left environmentalists, if you believe cars can run on water, engineer the car yourself.</p>
<p>All Mr. Jones can do is make noise, not invent.</p>

			<p>And why do we have to go to WorldNetDaily to get this story?  This guy sounds like one of the most extreme, radical people to ever be appointed to a top government post and no one at CNN, MSNBC, or ABC finds it newsworthy?  I am beginning to wonder how low the MSM will go and how much of their remaining credibility they are willing to put on the line to prop up Obama&rsquo;s approval numbers.  </p>

			<p>I remember last autumn when Obama was being criticized for his friendship w/Bill Ayres and Bernardine Dohrn and the liberals insisted that was all in the past; Obama was now a responsible, mainstream leader and would no longer associate w/leftist radicals. </p>
<p>Oh, well..</p>

			<p>Jones works for the Center for American Progress which is run by Clinton operative John Podesta. The Center for American progress is an extension of the Clintons. The Center for American progress is an extremly pro-war think tank. It is also openly agitates for the racial transformation of America throught the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy. As I have said many times, post-1965 immigration policy goes hand-in hand with wars of aggression.</p>
<p>Jones is on board with an immigration policy that will push the US population well past a billion. This fact alone makes him a fraud.</p>
<p>Let me put the whole thing in a nutshell: put a black face on the repspectable liberal environemental movement. The &#8220;respectable&#8221; environmental movement cheerleads open-borders non-white immigration. Making Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority becomes  top priority for the &#8220;respectable&#8221; environment movement. In other words, this is Environmentalism as a raced-based war against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe for one  minute that Van Jones would publicly call for Native Born White Americans to increase their fertility do you?  Look, there  is no environmental movement in the US.</p>
<p>Question for numbersusa:is your organization on board with the racial transformation of America?</p>

			<p>Jupiter at 8:23 brings up the key point. Massive immigration and environmental protection are incompatible. The simple rule is that anybody who claims to be an Environmentalist and does not support (at a minimum) substantial reductions in immigration, is a phoney, who is using Environmentalism to advance some other agenda. This agenda is usually Liberal.</p>

<p>Well, now this Rose Brooks has been appointed as a deputy of sorts at the Pentagon.  The woman is so far left as to be a security threat to this country, and she will have a top secret clearance and access to classified material that I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;ll pass along to other countries if it proves beneficial to this extremist, hate-filled Obama crowd.</p>
<p>So what are all these mid level Marxist radicals doing?  Why, they&rsquo;re writing warnings to the police departments and the newspapers, telling them that anybody on the right who has a conservative position of any kind is an evil terrorist.  </p>
<p>They represent the greatest threat to the stabiliity of this country in history, and they have the audacity to report that the mom, god, and apple pie crowd are wild-eyed radicals.</p>
<p>Of course to them they are.<br>

			<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;environMENTALists&#8221; are no more than shills for the one-world government coming into play.  Friends, it&rsquo;s about CONTROL  &mdash;  nothing more nothing less.  These &#8220;environMENTALists&#8221; are communists.  These sob&rsquo;s use George Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984&#8221; to play on words in order to further their aims.  &#8220;Swamps&#8221; are called &#8220;wetlands&#8221; while &#8220;jungles&#8221; are called &#8220;rainforests&#8221;.  Everyone with half a brain KNOWS that &#8220;swamps&#8221; and &#8220;jungles&#8221; are nasty places.  These &#8220;limp-wristed, birkenstock-wearing, bunny hugger, san francisco condo dwellers know NOTHING about &#8220;true environmentalism, which hunters and sportsmen do<br>
All one has to do is look at the &#8220;lynx fur hoax&#8221; that was perpetrated by &#8220;government environmentalist to put forests off-limits to logging.  They were almost successful but got caught planting the &#8220;lynx fur&#8221;  They were not punished for their crimes.<br>
Let&rsquo;s add the &#8220;disneyfication&#8221; of animals.  It would not surprise me if these so-called &#8220;environMENTALists&#8221; actually believe that animals can talk and portray human empathy and emotion.  Disney cartoons are fine for kids, but come on now!  ANY &#8220;outdoorsman&#8221; knows that animals rely on instinct and NOT human empathy.  Just look at the so-called &#8220;bear expert&#8221; who KNEW all about bears  &mdash;  he was eaten by one of his bears.  So much for animal/human empathy.<br>
Most environMENTALists should be forced to LIVE in the wilderness with the &#8220;wildlife&#8221; that they show so much concern for.  A few weeks of this and they would be ready to join the human race.</p>

<p>You spend way too much time watching Fox news and reading Ann Coulter. The environmnetal issue is a life and death issue. It was a terrible mistake for authentic conservatives to let the lieberals and left steal the enviromental issue. There is a direct line from this to Van Jones appointment. </p>
<p>I suspect you probably listen to Alex Jones also. Alex Jones philosophy is rape pillage the environemnt. He is incapable of scientific understanding. The state he lives in has been in drought state for several years.</p>

			<p>Green is the new Red. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the man-made Global Warming scam foisted by the NWO elite on Western nations, one of its purposes is to increase environmental taxes in order to fund the building of roads etc., for their North American Union(NAU). </p>
<p>In Europe the EU parliament is absolutely stuffed with neo-Marxists and &#8221;ex-Marxists&#8221; like Daniel &#8216;Dany the Red&rsquo; Cohn-Bendit, former Marxist student leader of the 1969 Paris riots which almost toppled France. Now in his sixties Cohn-Bendit has morphed into a German Green MEP and is leader of the Green grouping in the EU parliament. He also fervently backs the admission of Turkey and 71m Turks into the European Union (hardly green, is it) in the imminent enlarged EU Federal Superstate to include Turkey, North Africa and some West African states (which, don&rsquo;t ever forget was originally covertly sold to the people in the UK and other European states as a simple trading organisation for nations). The UK among many handouts of UK taxpayers&rsquo; money just donated £150m to African states to build roads. No doubt it will be revealed to be the same West African countries who are to join the enlarged EU. The EU has already opened employment offices in several of these West African states.<br>
 <br>
Yes, Green is the new Red and another aim of the Global Warming scam is to brainwash people into believing the planet is in danger (people who are engrossed in saving the planet will be too preoccupied to notice that the same NWO who created this scam are dismantling their own nation-states right before their very eyes in order to continue with their insane One-World government plan).</p>
<p>The same NWO neo-Marxist group keep popping up, Mikhael Gorbachev (has his own environmental Foundation in the USA, how convenient for his friends in the NWO); Al &#8216;Six-houses&rsquo; Gore&rsquo;, maker of the totally inaccurate scaremongering film (whose son is married to the great-granddaughter of Jacob Schiff, the financier who bankrolled the Russian Revolution) is another. The EU is not called the EUSSR or USSR Mark II for nothing and the Internet has hundreds of videos and articles, featuring hundreds of eminent scientists, on the man-made Global Warming scam. It&rsquo;s quite easy to learn the truth once you realise that man-made global warming is a scam created by the megalomaniacs of the NWO, our governments &amp; their stooges. Their One-World government agenda has been stepped-up into overdrive. Below are a video giving details of this scam and also a short 3-minute video on the same subject by the great Czech President, Vaclav Klaus, who shines out like a beacon against these conspiratorial dictators.</p>

<p>Like tj, you will foolishly allow the liberals and leftist steal the environmental-ecological  movement. Stay away from Alex Jones website. The glaciers are melting world wide. This could cause the mid-Atlantic conveyor belt to lose its salinity which is crucial to preventing a triggering of an ice age in North America.</p>
<p>I doubt Alex Jones could pass eigth grade pre-algebra. He is a commuity college drop-out. He knows nothing about science. Nor is he motivated to learn anything about science.</p>
<p>The foolishness of conservatives allowing the left-liberal types  to steal the ecology issue is monumental. Ultimatley, it will result in a death sentetnce for Native Born White Americans within the borders of America.</p>

			<p>I agree, Jupiter! It&rsquo;s vital, that we promote environmental protection. We should protect the environment for itself, and the fact that it justifies the ending of massive immigration by  itself. </p>
<p>I keep hearing Leftists telling almost only Whites in only White countries to stop having children, when their birthrate is already well below replacement level (in virtually all White coutntries). Yet, they NEVER mention the 3rd-World birthrate, and/or even massive (non-White) immigration into Western nations; and the non-Whites are having many more children. </p>
<p>Apparently, the self-hating Whites are more concerned about reducing Ireland&rsquo;s idigenous birthrate (and population size, which is less than 4 million), than China&rsquo;s and India&rsquo;s (which are each well above 1 Billion)! Yet, they also never mention a word about massive immigration into White countries such as Ireland. </p>
<p>Sorry to digress, but some White &#8220;Liberals&#8221; even want to increase industrializing China&rsquo;s birthrate!</p>
<p>I think there is more than they are telling us!</p>
