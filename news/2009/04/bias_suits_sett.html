<h1>Bias Suits Settled With Gold&rsquo;n Plump, Job Agency</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Serres, Star Tribune (Minneapolis), March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge gave approval for Gold&rsquo;n Plump Inc. and an employment agency to pay $1.35 million to settle lawsuits alleging religious discrimination against Muslims at a chicken processing plant in Cold Spring, Minn.</p>
<p>The money will go to 128 Somali Muslims who claim that St. Cloud-based Gold&rsquo;n Plump violated their religious rights by refusing to allow them prayer breaks during work hours, and to another 28 workers who said a St. Paul employment agency, the Work Connection Inc., required them to sign forms acknowledging they would be required to handle pork.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a settlement approved Tuesday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeanne Graham, Gold&rsquo;n Plump will add a paid break during the second half of each shift to accommodate Muslim employees who wish to pray. The break is in addition to one early in the shift and lunch breaks required by law.</p>
<p>The Work Connection has agreed to provide offers of employment to the 28 job seekers who were turned away for not signing the &#8220;pork form.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No sympathy for this Gold&rsquo;n Plump (sounds like a hip hop record label) from me.  They brought the Somalians here to be cheap and docile labor, and are so surprised when they use the civil rights laws of their new country against them.  That $1.35 million they must pay plus what they have paid their Somali workers is probably still less than what white Minnesotans would have made working there.  If it were up to me, the judgment would have been so high that it would send a message to other similar plants that non-white labor doesn&rsquo;t pay.</p>

			<p>The good thing is that the lawyers got almost one million dollars and the Somalians got only about $350,000 to divide amongst themselves.  Plus they will have to pay  30-35 percent federal, state and FICA tax on their windfall.</p>
<p>The IRS closely monitors us wage slaves when we win a lawsuit.</p>

			<p>To margaret:</p>
<p>I may be wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think lawsuit judgments are subject to taxation. Unless it depends on the type of judgment - pain and suffering vs. punitive damages.</p>

			<p>Nor can they expect further similar employment. The local mosque will &#8216;accept&rsquo; much of this payout in donations to support further immigration.</p>

			<p>This is just unbelievable!  Is this still the USA we&rsquo;re in? <br/>
Everything is getting crazier and crazier by the week.</p>

			<p>The settlement distributed among the plaintiffs comes out to about $2300 a pieces. Enough for a nice set of luggage and a plane ticket back to Somalia. Of course, the attorneys (white leftist?) will split the million amongst themselves. Several hundred thousand apiece. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt if the lawyers approached the Somalis and put them up to this.</p>

While I too have no sympathy for any business that seeks to employ alien ethnics and races, this ruling is very bad news.</p>
<p>Essentially, anyone who takes a job can now tell the employer how to run their business to accommodate them. Businesses can&rsquo;t protect themselves by not hiring these people because that would be &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s damned if you don&rsquo;t and damned if you do.</p>
<p>Businesses have cut their own throats. From now on, they&rsquo;re going to be at the mercy of, not only the people they don&rsquo;t hire (discrimination) but also to those they do hire.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m tempted to say they got what they deserve, this could be the death of any American business tries to maintain any standards of employment.</p>

			<p>I can personally say that in my dealings with these Somalis in Minnesota and Wisconsin, they are the most arrogant group of &#8220;gimme-gimme&#8221; immigrants ever.  They came here to escape war and threats on their lives, but could they be grateful or deal with Americans from a position of humble thankfulness?  NO.  They demand, demand, demand, and when anyone says anything they protest to the high heavens.  Four of them just shot up a house party in Lakeville, MN, and their &#8220;community leaders&#8221; right away are on spin control.  Many of them are being recruited to fight Muslim holy wars back in Africa, bringing a radical element right here to the USA. </p>
