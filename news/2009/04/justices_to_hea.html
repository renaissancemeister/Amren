<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frank Ricci has been a firefighter here for 11 years, and he would do just about anything to advance to lieutenant.</p>
<p>The last time the city offered a promotional exam, he said in a sworn statement, he gave up a second job and studied up to 13 hours a day. Mr. Ricci, who is dyslexic, paid an acquaintance more than $1,000 to read textbooks onto audiotapes. He made flashcards, took practice tests, worked with a study group and participated in mock interviews.</p>
<p>Mr. Ricci did well, he said, coming in sixth among the 77 candidates who took the exam. But the city threw out the test, because none of the 19 African-American firefighters who took it qualified for promotion. That decision prompted Mr. Ricci and 17 other white firefighters, including one Hispanic, to sue the city, alleging racial discrimination.</p>

			<p>I hope they win; political correctness has got to be muzzled. It looks like if one Black firefighter had qualified then that man would have been selected right then, and every whire man who qualified been told they were rejected for &#8220;lack of character&#8221; or &#8220;lack of leadership skills&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s use the civil rights laws in favor of whites for a change.</p>

			<p>Why are white firefighters, affected by affirmative action, the only ones who ever draw media/legal attention? I remember in the 1990&rsquo;s my city newspaper running a two week long investigation of race/racism in America. The whole thing was pages and pages of investigation into minority grievances, with the exception of one quote by a white firefighter who was complaining (the paper made him out to be a bigot). </p>
<p>I remember the peak of the news series seemed to be Thanksgiving Day. On that day, I noticed it seemed almost every car in the inner city was filled with a black man riding with his white wife. A major holiday being the day you&rsquo;re required to be with your number one, apparently.</p>
<p>As for the firefighter story, I might actually feel safer if a firefighter was black.  </p>

<i>&#8220;But the city threw out the test, because none of the 19 African-American firefighters who took it qualified for promotion.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Everyone attends the same classes, reads the same text books, undergoes the same training in the same time constraints.</p>
<p>How can anyone claims these tests are discriminatory?</p>
<p>When this issue came up in Buffalo a teenage boy wrote a letter to the Buffalo News and said pretty much the same thing I did. He said he worked for his grades and everyone in his class had the same choices to study or not. He was justifiably angry that his achievements, like those of white firefighters who weren&rsquo;t hired based on their test scores, could be overturned by political correctness.</p>
<p>That a high school student saw through the PC excuses was a glimmer of hope.<br>

			<p>Equality of opportunity is not enough in today&rsquo;s multicultural paradise, only equality of results will do. Since it is forbidden to have as the premise that there are significant average I.Q. differences among racial groups, then reasons for failure to have equality of results has to be a result of some kind of discrimination against the minority group which isn&rsquo;t up to the mark when competing on a level playing field.</p>
<p>Unless whites realize that they are now a minority group, at least as far as the youngest generation in the U.S. is concerned, and play hardball like all the other minority groups do, they will have to continue to &#8220;eat crow.&#8221; We need to begin to ostracize those fellow whites who don&rsquo;t push for the best interest of their own racial group - if it&rsquo;s not racist for a black or Hispanic to push for what&rsquo;s good for his or her group, it shouldn&rsquo;t be racist for a white to support a fellow white when an injustice is taking place. &#8220;What&rsquo;s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.&#8221;</p>

			<p> In my Navy days, we would have classes (Tuesdays) on the F-14 Tom-Cat systems, very simple, pay attention for 2 hours, take a 25 question test on what you were just told and if you failed had to go in on Saturday for a make-up test. Seems the only ones that failed the tests and had to go in on Saturdays were the blacks, they complained and the training was done away with.</p>

			<p>I have no respect for the hiring practices of any &#8220;governmental service&#8221; establishment. My Father worked for the United States Post Office for 36 years. He had a black female employee 20 years ago that decided she didn&rsquo;t want to do much of any work. She was too busy in the bathroom and/or being downright defiant. My Dad found she was in the bathroom so much that he had to start deducting sick time from her hours and asking her to take a sick day or personal day if she couldn&rsquo;t address her bathroom issue. We know there really wasn&rsquo;t one- she just didn&rsquo;t want to work, due to confirmation from a fellow white female who caught the black employee casually reading the newspaper, magazines, doing nails, makeup, etc. This was long before cell phones or I am certain she would have been on one of those as well. To make a long story short, my Dad was a supervisor at the time. He had enough warnings and other disciplinary issues to fire this woman, which he did. She immediately went down and filed a complaint with the NAACP. They took it all the way to court! She claimed Racism and Sexual Harrassment! Now my Dad is from Alabama- the most southern type you can met. He would NEVER be remotely attracted to a black. He went to court and told the court how he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t care what color an employee was- green, yellow, purple, red, white or black; if they didn&rsquo;t do their job, they were going to be fired.&#8221; He thought at that point, the Post Office would back him 100% for his hard work at maintaining an effective workplace. Didn&rsquo;t happen that way. The post office left him high and dry! They implemented new &#8220;diversity class&#8221; requirement for all employees to &#8220;extend new opportunities for effective communication for our diverse environment&#8221;. Thank God the judge listened effectively to the case and ruled wisely- the black female lost her case! But it was never the same for my Dad. He retired 18 months ago and you can&rsquo;t get him to tell you anything else about the &#8220;diverse&#8221; environment he left behind at the post office. </p>

			<p>These lawsuits are sprouting up all over the country.  The idea that race trumps high grades for promotion for diversity sake is ridulous.. Blacks have equal rights to  opportunities not to outcomes.  Diversity does not trump proformance.<br>
Another case of this kind was brought in Jacksonville, Fl. Four lieutenants claim their promotion to Captain was blocked by the then Fire Chief.   They claimed that race was a major factor. <br>
The firefighters are white, the fire chief, black. The jury had no problem in finding for the firefighers and awarding damages.</p>
<p>Many lawsuits are being brought across the country alleging reverse discrimination against police, fire and Municipal employees.  </p>

			<p>I think affirmative action was unfair, and a very bad idea, from the start. But now that the U.S has a Black president and a Black First lady (and who quite possibly benefitted from affirmative action in their college years), what remaining «reason» could there be for affirmative action?</p>
<p>Down with affirmative action! </p>

			<p>Discrimination by skin shade, hair texture, facial characteristics and amount of slovenly slurring speech is unconstitutional, illegal, and morally wrong. But it has been practiced for so long by government agencies that it has become accepted as normal.</p>
<p>A few lawsuits here and there aren&rsquo;t going to reverse years of unfairness.</p>

			<p>Low IQ is an important hidden variable when discussing the poor job performance of blacks. But it&rsquo;s by no means the only one. So is ADD. Blacks just have trouble concentrating on simple tasks for extended periods of time. It&rsquo;s part of the reason stores came up with the automatic change dispensing machines and laser scanners at the checkout. Remember when cashiers had to make change in their heads based on the amount they rung up at the register and the amount you tendered? That was back in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s when most supermarket and department store cashiers were, well, white. But even with these efficiency enhancing innovations, the checkout line with the obese black woman at the till still runs at half the speed of the line run by the Hispanic guy with the earring or the heavily tattooed white lady. And blacks seem to be going on half-hourly bathroom breaks with the white or Korean store manager meekly filling in. All stores should just start paying cashiers by the number of items they ring up. Likewise other places of employment should figure out how to pay for piecework so other ethnic groups aren&rsquo;t unfairly made to pick for &#8220;black slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another example of black ADD: Just look at our POTUS. Here&rsquo;s a guy whose been assigned the most demanding executive job in the country, and he appears to be perpetually &#8220;on break&#8221; just like those black supermarket cashiers and postal clerks. His silly incompetent gophers and interns seem to be doing all his work for him while he sits around daydreaming about God only knows what.</p>

			<p>This article reflects the ubiquitous disfunctionality among virtually every governmental system in our country   &mdash;   in areas for which there is a numerically significant percentage of blacks. It is beyond my comprehension how guilt ridden whites can, and do, automatically cast a blind eye [and ear] to blacks attempting to pass themselves off as someone possessing a modicum degree of facility with the English language. Particularly, when they can&rsquo;t even seem to string together a grammatically correct simple sentence. </p>
<p>Post offices, courthouses, police stations, fire stations, administrative offices, etc. etc. are increasingly being dominated by these totally incompetent black buffoons soaking up a pay check at tax payers&rsquo; expense. </p>
<p>Furthermore, one can&rsquo;t help but notice that when something doesn&rsquo;t go right [which is more often the case than not], it is never the clerk&rsquo;s responsibility. Everything is either the customer&rsquo;s fault, the supervisor&rsquo;s fault, or is beyond their job description. </p>
<p>Show me one, just one, neighborhood, city, county, state, or country, that is run by blacks that is, or has been, successful! One, just one! Moreover, although our current charismatic President may be able to prolong his honeymoon for a year or so, he will ultimately prove to be the same abysmal failure as every black mayor has been proven to be throughout the country. And, I might add, he WILL prove to be so bad that he WILL even surpass the total incompetence of his predecessor [a  feat of no small consequence]!  </p>
<p>We are now all standing on the brink of a major depression with the four Marx brothers: Obama, Summers, Geithner, and Bernanke, telling us: &#8220;the ship ain&rsquo;t sinking   &mdash;   listen to how great the band&rsquo;s playing&#8221;. Right! The only good thing to come out of all of this mess will be that the liberal whites will finally find out just how hard it is to be politically correct on [their own] empty stomachs!</p>
<p>As Mr. John says: &#8220;May God help us all&#8221;   &mdash;   we are sure gonna need it!</p>
