<h1>Research Shows White Players Lacking on Recent Final Four Basketball Teams</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Fowler, Orlando Sentinel, April 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>College basketball teams can thrive with white players.</p>
<p>But the odds of a team cutting down the Final Four nets aren&rsquo;t good if that team is stocked with many white guys, Orlando Sentinel research shows. College basketball at its highest levels is dominated by black players even if the subject makes some people uncomfortable. Look no further than this weekend in Detroit. Only two white players  &mdash;  North Carolina&rsquo;s Tyler Hansbrough and Michigan State&rsquo;s Goran Suton  &mdash;  will be listed among the combined 20 starters for the four teams in this year&rsquo;s NCAA Tournament semifinals. And two teams  &mdash;  Villanova and Connecticut  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t have a white player on scholarship on this year&rsquo;s active roster.</p>
<p>Michigan State is the only team from this year&rsquo;s Final Four that signed more than nine white players to scholarships between 1997 and 2008.</p>
<p>Recruiting numbers spell it out in black and white: Since the 2000 tournament, 34 of 40 Final Four teams played consistently with no more than one white starter during that particular year. The 2003 Syracuse team, with white starters Gerry McNamara and Craig Forth, was the only one to win a championship.</p>
<p>The last championship team to rely on at least three white starters was Duke in 1991, its first of back-to-back championships thanks to Bobby Hurley, Christian Laettner and Billy McCaffrey, who started most of that season.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coaches say there are more good white players than ever, and the growth of the game in other parts of the world has also brought new white talent to the college game. Amateur Athletic Union basketball circuits are laced with white players.</p>
<p>Despite those encouragements, black players are a solid majority in college basketball.</p>
<p>Richard Lapchick, director of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, said black players currently comprise 60.4 percent of college basketball, which he calls &#8220;probably the highest number in a long time.&#8221; In the 1999-2000 season, that number was 55.5 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The research was compiled through team photos, rosters, recruiting databases, media guides and school sports information departments. The criteria: No walk-ons, a signee&rsquo;s or transfer&rsquo;s first season with the school must have been 1997-98 or beyond, and at least one official game of playing time was required.</p>
<p>Based on a team&rsquo;s average of about four signees per year, 12 of the 23 teams sampled by the Sentinel gave less than 20 percent of their scholarships to white players.</p>
<p>The game has changed since Texas Western, led by black players, beat all-white Kentucky in the 1966 championship game to help usher out the era of segregation and usher in widespread recruitment of black players at major programs. But you won&rsquo;t find many players or coaches who&rsquo;ll talk openly about race in basketball today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Stereotypes persist</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The perception is still this: How can a white guy possibly play today without smarts?&#8221; said Kevin Grevey, a white former Kentucky star in the early 1970s and with the NBA&rsquo;s Washington Bullets. &#8220;And how could a black player possibly play without athleticism? It&rsquo;s not fair, but it&rsquo;s the perception.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research began with 1997 because that was the year Donovan [Florida Coach Billy Donovan] arrived as coach at Florida. Since then, he has cultivated a program in which white players flourish.</p>
<p>Florida has had 14 white scholarship players since Donovan arrived, tied with traditional white-player mecca Duke for most among the 11 teams with two or more Final Four appearances since 1997. Ohio State, with 13 white players on scholarship in that span, is tied with Kentucky for third.</p>
<p>None of the other seven programs on the list  &mdash;  Kansas (11), UCLA (10), Michigan State (10), Arizona (9), UNC (9), Maryland (7) and UConn (5)  &mdash;  signed more than 11 white players that played at least a portion of a season.</p>
<p>Donovan&rsquo;s ascension into coaching royalty began with white cornerstones. He had a top-scorer in Mike Miller, talented point guards Teddy Dupay and Brett Nelson and a good shooter off the bench in Matt Bonner. That group, coupled with a collection of black players including Udonis Haslem and Donnell Harvey, guided Florida to a Final Four in 2000.</p>
<p>Signing white players in bulk hasn&rsquo;t exactly strengthened Florida lately. The Gators started three white players on the way to this year&rsquo;s National Invitation Tournament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duke signed 11 white players between 2002 to 2008. In that span, the team has been eliminated from the NCAA Tournament by a lower-seeded opponent in six consecutive years and has failed to advance beyond the round of 16 five times.</p>
<p>The Blue Devils only Final Four team in that stretch came in 2004. J.J. Redick was its lone white starter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Style of play matters</b></p>
<p>The numbers often hinge on style of play, players and coaches say. Florida forward Dan Werner, who is white, said the difference in schools signing black or white players could be playing &#8220;more up and down, and that caters to guys who are more athletic&#8221; or &#8220;Princeton (offense) stuff, slowdown and backdoor cuts maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jon Entine, author of the book Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We&rsquo;re Afraid to Talk About It, said the perception of the superior black athlete actually is based on genetics.</p>
<p>&#8220;White players can compete,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are finally able to match the style of play of the black player in some regards. But any controversy between black and white players and this topic stems from a cultural difference, because the genetic terminology isn&rsquo;t controversial. It&rsquo;s not going to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The perfect white or black player  &mdash;  the one with the skill to run a complex offense, the athleticism to knock his head on the rim and the classroom prowess to stay in school  &mdash;  is still a rarity, Mississippi State assistant coach Robert Kirby said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a [black] player is a really good athlete and great student, why would he go to Vanderbilt when he can go to North Carolina and Duke?&#8221; asked Kirby, who is black. &#8220;They&rsquo;ve been in the NCAA Tournament every year, the Sweet 16 every year. Why go to Vandy? Why would they come to Mississippi State?</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes with academic requirements it&rsquo;s hard to get kids in, so you recruit much lesser athletes and you make do with that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>See Caste Football to see why whites are discriminated against.</p>
<p>Oddly, these schools that have few whites are also have low graduation rates for their players, which the media complain about this time every year.</p>
<p>Tyler Hansborough is from Poplar Bluff, Missouri.  During his senior year of high school, his Poplar Bluff H.S. Mules beat a high-powered all-black team from St. Louis inner city for the state championship in their size class that year, it was very much an upset.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only two whites out of 20 starters in final four.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, there are still more than enough goof ball whites to fill the spectator section to watch the games.</p>
<p>Disgusting.  Too large a percentage of whites are disunited fools. <br/>

			<p> This is one of those areas where most people really DON&rsquo;T want to talk about race   &mdash;   unlike the faux claims that we need a &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221; and refuse to hold one. I remember once noting in a group of friends that there had been no White players at all in a basketball game we had all watched the night before, and one of them, a smart-aleck lawyer, said, &#8220;Why, Wayne, why would you notice something like that?&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Because I&rsquo;m not blind, that&rsquo;s why!&#8221;</p>
<p> I think a big reason that Whites don&rsquo;t go out for basketball in this country as much as they once did is that everyone has bought into this canard about basketball being the &#8220;black man&rsquo;s game.&#8221; But European players are increasingly showing that that&rsquo;s not necessarily so, at all.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see the point of this article.</p>
<p>Black athletes are just better. They got their scholarship on athletic merit. If they can stay in school, and some degrees are easy enough to obtain, there&rsquo;s no reason to care. Schools signing athletes on scholarship don&rsquo;t need to consider the academic impact these athletes will have, as long as they pass. Africans have more athletic bodies, degrees are easy enough to obtain to assume he will get one, there we go!</p>
<p>The only problem with college sports are people &#8220;passing&#8221; student-athletes when they don&rsquo;t deserve it. But that&rsquo;s a separate issue, and independent of &#8220;white athletes being discriminated against for being less athletically prone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No kidding. This has only been obvious for about, oh, 20 years. What&rsquo;s funny is when the camera pans to the students in the arena. Overwhelmingly white. Of course. </p>

<p>&#8220;Dominate sports&#8221;? Huh, I suppose I&rsquo;m just having a minor psychotic episode whenever I hear about how <i>We need more black hockey players/swimmers&hellip;</i> then.</p>
<p>(Of course, the problem with is when too many people ask why <i>&#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221;</i> when whites are clearly advantaged while <i>&#8220;race is responsible for the difference&#8221;</i> when they aren&rsquo;t) </p>

			<p>I think white guys got turned off to basketball&hellip;for a while&hellip;<br/>
lately I&rsquo;m seeing some real talent back in the game&hellip;that spurs<br/>
others&hellip;white boys can be quick and shoot the lights out&hellip;if<br/>
they work at it&hellip;.</p>

			<p>I will concede blacks are better basketball players than whites.</p>
<p>That is important until they are 21 or 22 years old.</p>
<p>After that 99.9% of them are has-beens.</p>
<p>What are they going to do the next 50-60 years?</p>

			<p>eventually whites will tire of paying these submorons to play sports for them - and their multimillion dollar salaries. take note of the faces on the paying crowd - white. also note those in the FREE front row &#8216;player&rsquo;s family seats&rsquo; - black. people are taking notice and blacksketball and nfl blootball are both getting old. unfortunately, this happens since whites are children. - getting passed over for anyone who claims to be or looks black. sad, unrecognized racism. anything and everything blacks claim is racism, racism against whites is not racism. it&rsquo;s a ridiculous double standard.</p>

			<p>The white player&rsquo;s who ride the bench, more than likely excel much greater academically than the black starters. What&rsquo;s disturbing of course, is that once the blacks players graduate from college, ones that start and the one&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;t, are almost guarenteed a good paying job because of affirmative action. </p>

			<p>Black kids should be better at basketball than white kids.</p>
<p>White young people are so much more well-rounded than blacks at the same age.</p>
<p>Of course you are going to tbe better at a certain endeavor when you narrowly focused on it.</p>

			<p>The rising sport in the West is mixed martial arts, and whites are quite good at this sport since they are typically better than blacks at wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and certain other martial arts that are essential to a good fighter. Y&rsquo;all should tune in to Spike TV, where they air the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship).</p>

<p>Where you will see Rashad Evans, Quinton Jackson (ranked 1 and 2 in the light heavyweight division)as well as Anderson Silva and several other blacks doing well.</p>
<p>One thing that mixed martial arts has shown though is the viability and importance of European skills such as wrestling and boxing. Brazilian Jujitsu is a traditional Japanese art modified by  white Brazilians. It used to be that Far Eastern martial arts had this aura of invincibility. Think of the cult of Bruce Lee.</p>

			<p>The dominance of blacks in college basketball and football would be eliminated if SAT scores of 1000, which is the real minimum of intellectual ability to achieve at the college level, was enforced.  If a 1000 SAT was mandatory for all collegients, college basketball and football teams would resemble Brigham Young&rsquo;s teams rather than Connecticut&rsquo;s or Alabama&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The &ldquo;perception&rdquo; of genetic differences between blacks and whites is real. Blacks, on average, have more muscle, less body fat and heavier bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Complete rubbish.  First off, on average blacks tend to be more obese than whites.  So much for &#8220;less body fat&#8221;.  </p>
<p>More muscle and heavier bones?  Where&rsquo;d you get that from?  <br/>
If that was true why is it Whites dominate sports requiring extreme strength and power? i.e. Olympic power-lifting, wrestling, World Strongest Man competitions, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The UFC and MMA has already been mentioned but I just want to add that there isn&rsquo;t a black man on earth that can hang in the ring with Fedor Emilanenko&hellip; (sorry if I butchered his last name)          </p>
