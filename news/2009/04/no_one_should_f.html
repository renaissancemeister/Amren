			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pauline Arrillaga, AP, April 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five men dead in an apartment.</p>
<p>In a county that might see five homicides in an entire year, the call over the sheriff&rsquo;s radio revealed little about what awaited law enforcement at a sprawling apartment complex.</p>
<p>A type of crime, and criminal, once foreign to this landscape of blooming dogwoods had arrived in Shelby County. Sheriff Chris Curry felt it even before he laid eyes on the grisly scene. He called the state. The FBI. The DEA. Anyone he could think of.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve got,&#8221; he warned them. &#8220;But I&rsquo;m gonna need help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five dead men lay scattered about the living room of one apartment in a complex of hundreds.</p>
<p>Some of the men showed signs of torture: Burns seared into their earlobes revealed where modified jumper cables had been clamped as an improvised electrocution device. Adhesive from duct tape used to bind the victims still clung to wrists and faces, from mouths to noses.</p>
<p>As a final touch, throats were slashed open, post-mortem.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Curry and federal agents to piece together clues: A murder scene, clean save for the crimson-turned-brown stains now spotting the carpet. Just a couple of mattresses tossed on the floor. It was a typical stash house.</p>
<p>But the cut throats? Some sort of ghastly warning.</p>
<p>Curry would soon find this was a retaliation hit over drug money with ties to Mexico&rsquo;s notorious Gulf Cartel.</p>
<p>Curry also found out firsthand what federal drug enforcement agents have long understood. The drug war, with the savagery it brings, knows no bounds. It had landed in his back yard, in the foothills of the Appalachians, in Alabama&rsquo;s wealthiest county, around the corner from The Home Depot.</p>
<p>One thousand, twenty-four miles from the Mexico border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some 10,560 people have been killed since 2006, the year Mexican President Felipe Calderon took office and launched his campaign against the organized crime gangs that move cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and heroin to a vast U.S. market. Consider that fewer than 4,300 American service members have died in the six-year war in Iraq.</p>
<p>The cartels are fighting each other for power, and the Calderon administration for their very survival. Never before has a Mexican president gone after these narco-networks with such force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And now the cartels have brought the fight to us: In 230 U.S. cities, the Mexican organizations maintain distribution hubs or supply drugs to local distributors, according to the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Drug Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>Places like Miami and other longtime transportation points along the California, Arizona and Texas borders. But also Twin Falls, Idaho. Billings, Mont. Wichita, Kan. Phoenix. St. Louis. Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Even Shelby County.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One reason for that shift is the ability these days to &#8220;blend in in plain sight,&#8221; as the Atlanta DEA chief puts it. The flood of Hispanic immigrants into American communities to work construction and plant jobs helped provide cover for traffickers looking to expand into new markets or build hubs in quiet suburbs with fewer law officers than the big cities.</p>
<p>Shelby has long been Alabama&rsquo;s fastest-growing county, with its proximity to Birmingham, good schools and a growing corporate corridor along Highway 280. The number of Hispanics grew 126 percent from 2000 to 2007. It was once rare to see a Latino face at the local Wal-Mart or gas station. Now, dozens upon dozens of Hispanic day laborers line Lorna Road in the northern part of the county.</p>
<p>As Bowden says, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t stand out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With some 4.9 million trucks crossing into the United States from Mexico every year, tractor-trailers have become a transportation mode of choice among traffickers. Drugs head north, but weapons and cash also head back south  &mdash;  like the $400,000 Border Patrol agents found on April 2 near Las Cruces, N.M., stashed in the refrigeration unit of a semi.</p>
<p>Shelby County is a trucking mecca, with highways 65, 20, 59 and 459 running east to Atlanta, north to Nashville, south to New Orleans, west to Dallas. Once reluctant to haul drug shipments too far beyond a border state, drivers are willing to take more chances now, because there are so many trucks on the road, Bowden says.</p>

			<p>Local police agencies should immediately turn over any murder investigation of an outsider to the feds.  Let the feds spend the time and money investigating and prosecuting murders of illegals.  Why waste state tax money on prosecutions of the murders of people that no one cares about and who shouldn&rsquo;t be here in the first place.</p>

			<p>  And another reason to celebrate diversity has been revealed to us in all its gory detail. I sure wish all the liberal loons had to spend a day in this apartment with the bodies. And stay tuned folks, this sort of grand diversity is coming to your town real soon, if it isn&rsquo;t there already. What sort of diseased mind could possibly think that diversity and multiculturalism is a wonderful thing? The only thing I can figure, is the elites that think its wonderful don&rsquo;t have to live amongst them. They live in nice communities (probably gated). They don&rsquo;t send their children to public schools. They have bodyguards to protect them. Corporate America and the liberal loons and neo-cons have shafted the working people of this country. Republicans and democrats are equally to blame.</p>

<p>Why does this surprise anyone? With our lack of border control, this is to be expected. The problem is only going to get worse. The question is how bad will it get before white America does something?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8221;We became a hub without knowing it,&#8221; Sheriff Curry says. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to wake people up because we&rsquo;re seeing it all over the place. It is now firmly located throughout this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one of the consequences of not protecting the borders, and allowing foreigners to come and go pretty much as they please.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a fractious society that is constantly in danger of being ripped apart over racial and ethnic differences on a daily basis, with each tribe trying to gain dominance and control for its group.  It&rsquo;s the squabbling boarding house that T. Roosevelt warned about.</p>
<p>Adding to the racial turmoil, we&rsquo;re over extended in two wars and involved in trying to maintain an empire while we act as the world&rsquo;s policemen.  If that weren&rsquo;t bad enough, we&rsquo;re in the midst of the worst economic catastrophe to EVER hit this country.  So, on top of all that the authorities just now  discover we&rsquo;ve had a growing drug gang problem that has been getting stronger every year for years now.  And, from the looks of what is happening on the border with the Mexican army having running gun battles with these cartels, the situation is so explosive it could well set off a civil war in Mexico that probably will see the cartels in charge and, in the process of it all, Mexico&rsquo;s war will undoubtedly spill over into this country, getting the US involved.  </p>
<p>Every decade this country gets worse in every way.  This time, though, I think we&rsquo;re coming up on the last signpost that warns us that disintegration lies just ahead.</p>

			<p>I would like to take the opportunity to urge people to make a donation to the VDARE website at this time as they are having their fund-raising drive right now and they are fighting hard against illegal immigration. </p>
<p>    However, they need help because they don&rsquo;t have the same amount of money that the anti-American SPLC has and therefore any donation at all is greatly appreciated. (I do not have any affiliation with VDARE, I just believe it&rsquo;s a great website trying to stop what&rsquo;s happening in this country, like what&rsquo;s going on with these Mexican cartels).</p>
<p>     Therefore, if you can make any donation at all, please do so at the following link and it will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Skip, what Muslims? Where are they? You mean a few isolated places like Ann Arbor? Most Muslims live far away from the US and they aren&rsquo;t coming here in any demographically significant numbers. One Arab blowing themselves up amounts to nothing but a media side show to keep you distracted from the real changes. </p>
<p>This is a demographic numbers game. That&rsquo;s why the media do their best to play down the illegal Mexican numbers to 12 million, when reality is probably closer to 20-25 million and for all we know 40 million. What happens with those 12-40 million Mexicans is going to determine your future and your children&rsquo;s future. </p>

<p>I intend to do just thay SOC.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d just like to say that there are three other vitally important sites that SHOULD DEFINITELY be monetarily supported also in addition to V-Dare, and that is this one, Amren, Council of Conservative Citizens and the Europen American Issues Forum. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the only ones I know of that are ACTIVELY pursuing our best interests.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t support those sites that are looking out for us, we deserve to continue to go downhill as a people.</p>

			<p>Why is this story being so widely distributed, clearly stating that this violence is a consequence of immigration?  For years, I&rsquo;ve heard nothing from the MSM but feel good stories about Mexicans going to college, or pity stories about Mexican who don&rsquo;t go to college.  Now they&rsquo;re doing AmRen&rsquo;s investigative stories for us.  Are they scared that a coming collapse of Mexico might blow up in their faces?  <br>
     We peasants may look on our Rulers as a monolithic bloc, but like the old Communist Party of the USSR, there are divisions and rivalries and hatreds that even surpass their hatred of the White race.  Obama is the agent of one faction, G.W. Bush was the agent of another, but don&rsquo;t doubt the the two main gangs have sub-gangs who exceed the Crips and Bloods in their animosity and ruthlessness.  Just a couple weeks ago, BHO had one group of corporate bosses over to the White house for warm water and a warning from the rival corporate bosses that Obama serves.  White politicians betray their own race on behalf of their silent backers.  Are they any less willing to betray each other?  I think it may be worthwhile to consider how the corporate Outs may seek to use Whites against the corporate Ins.  </p>

			<p>What people don&rsquo;t realize is that large, mestizo populations are stomping grounds for drug cartels.  Areas like these are already fraught with crime, so the chances of being caught by the police are smaller than a peaceful, white area.  Plus, the police don&rsquo;t patrol these places as often, and are more hesitant to investigate them due to the hostile population.  Speaking of the populace, they would rather side with drug gangs than cooperate with white police, so that means no witnesses.</p>
<p>Want to keep out drug cartels?  Keep out the mestizos first.  The gangs don&rsquo;t hang around white areas.  They stick with their own kind.</p>

			<p>These mexicans are descendants of Aztecs and Mayans&hellip; notorious bloodthirsty and ruthless peoples who our Conquistador ancestors had to wage vicious war against to get them to stop their insane mass human sacrifices.</p>
<p>They are still continuing the same grisly behavior today, but in the context of the drug business.</p>
<p>The only solutions are:</p>
<p>1) legalize drugs and regulate them and their trade.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) deport most of these illegal mestizos back south of the border.  </p>

			<p>Mike, your message is right on. It&rsquo;s incredible to believe that there are so many boomers and other citizens with children, that couldn&rsquo;t care less what they are setting them up for by not taking action on every politician who will not side with Americans on illegal immigration and the mainly Mexican invasion.</p>
