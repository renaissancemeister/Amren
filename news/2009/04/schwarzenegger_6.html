<h1>Schwarzenegger: Immigrants Not Cause of Budget Woe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael R. Blood, AP, April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Wednesday that health care and other services for illegal immigrants cost California taxpayers as much as $6 billion a year, but that&rsquo;s not the reason for the state&rsquo;s financial mess.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the huge burden that comes with millions of illegal residents, the governor said the source of a $42 billion budget hole is a broken system in Sacramento. He urged voters to support six ballot proposals in next month&rsquo;s special election that he says will repair it.</p>
<p>At an appearance at the Los Angeles Times, the Republican governor estimated that education and other services for illegal immigrants could carry a $4 billion to $6 billion price tag each year.</p>
<p>But to place blame there for the ongoing budget mess  &mdash;  or any other single factor  &mdash;  &#8220;would be the wrong thing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added that Washington holds the power to resolve immigration issues, not California, and comprehensive reform is on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s agenda.</p>

			<p>Bold face lie for this reason:the population of California is quite large and growing. This wears out infrastructure and creates a need for new infrastructure. There is always a huge price tag that comes with rapid population growth..especially if the policy goal is to create a large middle class for millions of new &#8220;Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>But this issue isn&rsquo;t even central to the concerns of White Nationalists. The fundamental issue is the racial transformation of California which is transforming California into a colony of mexico,china,india,pakistan and india. California is no longer America. Everyone knows understands this obvious point.</p>
<p>Suppose that since 1965 the only immigrants that had been allowed into California had been chinese and the population growth generated is equal to all of the population growth generated by all of the actual  post-1965 immigrants -and their children-to California. Suppose the budget was in sound shape also. Would this be a good thing? For Native Born White Americans it would be still be a catastrophe for they would have lost the state of California to millions of chinese nationals and their &#8220;american&#8221; born geneline. And in losing the land mass of Calfornia to all those &#8220;super smart&#8221; tax paying  post-1965 chinese and their offspring&hellip;. all the educational infrastructure,military infrastructure,technological infrastrucure,argricultural land and national and state parks in California. This is usually what happens when one nation invades and colonizes another nation.</p>
<p>The moral of the story:frame the issue the right way. Frame it exclusively in terms of the interests of Native Born White Americans:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of invasion and colonization&hellip;from china or any other nation.</p>

			<p>Perhaps he is right in that $6 billion is the direct cost to the state.  But he forgets about the other side of that equation   &mdash;   how much less is the state taking in because illegal aliens et al. have driven away so many white people to other states?  The interesting thing to see from the California budget is the total revenue taken in, I bet it&rsquo;s declining from year to year.</p>

			<p>Governator Swartzamillions is missing a very important point here.Illigal immigration is about MUCH more than dollars.It is about what kind of a nation we will be leaving to our children, grandchildren, etc, etc, etc.Because HE has zillions of moolahbucks, illegal immigration will not affect HIM negatively, but what about those of us with much more modest means?So what if all of the working poor have to share their wealth and prosperity with a horde of people?  As long as HE has HIS, so what?</p>

			<p>Thanks for explaining it to me, Governor.  Now I understand. The state&rsquo;s problem is that the Tax Slaves are not paying enough taxes.  Your ballot proposals are all tax increases and more of the never-ending state bonds - taxes on the future of the state.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better get the wall up around the north and east boundaries of the state very soon, as the productive class is going to flee even faster than they have been doing since the Rodney King riots.</p>

			<p>California also has had to raise, educate and otherwise provide for a huge amount of &#8220;legal&#8221; anchor babies.  I understand that Schwarzenegger (I can never get over that name) is in a difficult political position, but his statement above is more fit for a comedy routine than a serious political statement.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He added that Washington holds the power to resolve immigration issues, not California&#8221;</p>
<p>Does he mean to say that California has no power over their own checkbook? Putting a stop to the freebies would be a great first step, even if they deported no one. Not a citizen? Then no benefits for you. Simple. How hard can it be to just stop writing checks on an account with NSF? Any citizen would be in jail if they kept this up. Changing the law, or the state constitution, so that politicians faced the same penalty as the rest of us, just might help them find the motivation to balance that checkbook.</p>
<p>&hellip;&ldquo;would be the wrong thing,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swear, these politicians have no ethics, no moral compass whatsoever. No, tolerating illegal entry with the intent to steal, is what is wrong. The bigger &#8216;wrong&rsquo;? Knowingly distributing the taxpayers hard-earned dollars to illegal aliens, intentionally denying those dollars from ever reaching the American citizens they were intended for.</p>
<p>The third wrong? Thinking they can panhandle the rest of America, expecting us to pony up federal tax monies to bail them out from their irresponsible, sanctuary-state behavior. Behaviors they have no intention of changing. I see no reason to pay another dime to California.   </p>

			<p>OK, only 6 billion.  No big deal.  As long as they aren&rsquo;t the sole cause of the budget crises.  It&rsquo;s a 6 billion well spent to make permanent residents out of people who will struggle to earn a middle class income on their own, and then demand (and receive)welfare and employment preferences to offset the &#8220;racist&#8221; system that is the cause of their difficulties.  They will also help to keep the prisons full, and create jobs in the criminal justice system that they themselves will receive preferences to fill, and only those who speak their language need bother applying for.  I imagine quite a few state jobs will be &#8216;english optional&rsquo; by quarter-mark of the century, if not sooner.</p>
<p>And best of all, they will help tear down the racist class system that has been holding America back for centuries now, the same racist system that didn&rsquo;t deport them (as it should have) when it had the chance. </p>

			<p>Arnold passed himself off as a conservative when he was elected.  However, he failed to tell us that he practiced the Teddy Kennedy type of conservatism. Between Arnold and the out of control left-wing legislature, the state of California, with it&rsquo;s outrageous taxes to support ever liberal cause, is on the brink of bankruptcy. Many, if not most, of the state  legislators are Latino and place illegal alien &#8220;rights&#8221; above every other issue. State senator Gil Cadillo (One Bill Gil) wants driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal aliens and has brought that bill up numerous times.  This guy obviously thinks he is working for Mexico, or acts like it.(He is currently running for Congress) And guess what these &#8220;leaders&#8221; came up with to address the state&rsquo;s financial problems?  You guessed it, more taxes. They don&rsquo;t believe in cutting any of their hare-brained programs. The result is that the productive citizens of California are voting with their feet and fleeing the state in droves.  Yeah, Arnie is the real TERMINATOR, he is terminating the state of California./</p>

			<p>Yes, Arnold, $6 billion is really such a small amount, isn&rsquo;t it.  Nothing to even worry about.  But then consider that the majority of the illegal and legal Mexican invaders will never be able to earn or save any money their entire lives, and hence will pay few taxes, but will require massive Social Security and Medicare in their old age.  Guess who will pay for that?  </p>
<p>Then add to that the fact that this problem will continue for generations, as the explosive reproduction of Mexicans will produce ever more &#8220;wards&rsquo; of the State.  Already mortgages to minorities have crippled our economy.  Imagine when there are 10 times as many low-skilled, uneducated, and frustrated minorities, to each tax-paying European-American.  What will happen then?  Welcome to Haiti. </p>

<p>Well, I just love a captain who will go down with his ship.  </p>
<p>Next year about this time, when nothing California can do to make up for its budget shortfall, I&rsquo;m looking for the drastic forced cuts in the budget to start some serious violence there.<br>
The budget not only will not be met, declining revenues will mean that it will be next to impossible to continue running the government as it is today.</p>
<p>Adios, California.  You asked for it, and you&rsquo;re going to get it.</p>

			<p>Edward, friend&hellip;show us some love. Californians voted for Prop. 187 more than a decade ago, which would have denied education and other services to illegals, but the CA Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional. A lot of people are fed up and vocal about it, but our politicians are afraid to piss-off Hispanic voters. With so many of them here, that&rsquo;s something they figure they can&rsquo;t afford to do. If anyone has an answer for this, we welcome it.</p>

Buses in San Diego are carrying the announcement that due to the budget crisis, the State has eliminated all subsidies ($14 millilon)to public transit, therefore drastic changes in service, and raises in fares can be anticipated.</p>
<p>I assume this is going to be the case all over California.</p>

			<p>Well, the services the Governor mentions may be costing &#8216;only&rsquo; $6,000,000,000.00 per annum, but they are only one corner of the big picture. Don&rsquo;t know where to begin to describe the rest of California&rsquo;s economic picture, but I&rsquo;ll make a list:</p>
<p>Drugs: Not only are immigrants importing, manufacturing, and selling; they&rsquo;re also consuming.  I suspect a huge percentage of drugs consumed by &#8216;whites&rsquo; are being consumed by hispanics classified as white.  Illegal drugs cost any society huge sums of money.</p>
<p>Crime: Crime costs money. Fighting it, preventing it, and dealing with its aftermath all cost serious money.  We did not need to import a second criminal class.  But we have.</p>
<p>White Flight: How do you put a valuation on a white resident:  Someone who works like a dog, behaves himself, pays his taxes, reproduces responsibly and then does a passable job rearing his offspring? We know that hundreds of thousands (or millions) of middle-class whites have fled California because of immigrants and the problems they cause.  Any number we could come up with would be arbitrary&hellip;.but the number of dollars lost because of lost whites would be enormous.  Why did the new Communist nations of the twentieth century forbid emigration?  Because it is costly to lose your middle class.  Anyway, the whites who have fled California are no longer CONTRIBUTING to that state&rsquo;s economy.  They&rsquo;ve been replaced by people who drain from the economy.  And those whites who have fled California are likely to have taken much (if not all) of their net worth with them.</p>
<p>Loss in real estate values: Some of the recent drop in value is due to the Bubble Effect, but much of it is due to the fact that most people (including non-whites) do not wish to live surrounded by non-whites.  Over half of the loss in value, Nationwide, is in the &#8216;Sand States&rsquo;, the very states most blighted by inappropriate immigration.  People, including undesirables, will not continue indefinitely to pay premium prices in neighborhoods (no matter how luxurious) filled with undesirables.</p>
<p>Money sent &#8216;back home&rsquo;: I have no idea how much money, last year, was directly deleted from California&rsquo;s economy by immigrants sending money home to their families. I would assume it is in the billions.  Multiplier Effect applies to those billions.</p>
<p>It is pointless to assign a value to California&rsquo;s formerly optimistic and just-plain-heavenly social climate.  It&rsquo;s going fast, though, and going with it are a great many people like me, who used to go there to get a refill on &#8216;reason to live&rsquo;.  California made me happy long enough to heal my frustrations with the stupidity I have to endure in Mississippi. &#8216;Made&rsquo; was in the past tense, because I don&rsquo;t go to California, anymore.  Now, I drag my husband to a state in the Northeast that&rsquo;s full of white people.  He only kicked and screamed the first time.  He&rsquo;s come to appreciate the regenerative value of a week surrounded by people with good sense.  California has lost my tourist dollars, and the tourist dollars of countless others, because it&rsquo;s just not much fun, anymore.  That loss of &#8216;ambience&rsquo; is completely due to immigration.</p>
<p>Please forgive if this list is deficient.  I&rsquo;m just an old Redneck woman with a BA from a third-rate Mississippi school.  But if these things are obvious to me, then they should be obvious to anyone in a position to shape public policy.</p>

			<p>  California used to have America&rsquo;s best school system, the highest employment, reasonable housing, great weather, modern highways, and the highest standard of living in the nation. Now all of these are gone, except for the great weather. Anyone not in a multicultural stupor will acknowledge that the descent into bankruptcy and chaos was driven by uncontrolled growth due to immigration. In the last decades, that immigration has been mostly illegal from Mexico and Central America. Wake up Arnie and smell the coffee!</p>

			<p>LA teacher&hellip;if those of us who love our country and want illegals sent home, we could certainly have another &#8220;tea party,&#8221; but this time one that would send the message of how we feel about illegal immigration. I was happy to be a part of one and the turn out was great. We have watched and stayed silent while illegals and their supporters have marched in our streets. Let&rsquo;s turn the tables. Independence Day would be a great day for it, as that date had been mentioned for another gathering. However, it might be a bit late. I&rsquo;m sure Obama is busy inviting the rest of Mexico here. It seems to be an established fact that we owe Mexico their daily bread and a lot more, but it&rsquo;s worth a chance.</p>

			<p>I was in San Francisco area a couple of years ago. You might as well rename the area North Mexico or East China. It makes me think that the official estimate of illegals in the state is but a fraction of their actual number. So too must be the estimates of what they cost the state. We really have no way of determining the actual numbers. The politicians will of course spin anything they tell us, minimizing the impact. They lie to us about everything else, so why should we give credence to anything they say. The consensus amoung the residents I talked to is that the immigration problem, legal and illegal, is much worse than admitted. They firmly believe that the state&rsquo;s problems are directly related to this fact, just as many elsewhere beleive that the nation&rsquo;s problems are directly related to the cost of immigration. It all amounts to a disenfranchisment of the citizens, which is precisely the goal of the ruling elite. They do not want citizens; they want subjects. And immigrants make great subjects, mostly being quite used to the concept. Tax paying, bible reading, gun owning Americans make lousy subjects. King George found that out way back when. Maybe we should give our current &#8220;kings and princes&#8221; the same lesson, before they bury us with taxes, impose foreign religions and take our guns.</p>

			<p>Here are some of the REAL reasons that California is going down.  I love having a governor who is mellow during the collapse.  </p>
<p>1.  Over 10% of the population is collecting unemployment.</p>
<p>2.  The state sales tax has increased 2% in the last year, putting an unbearable burden on manufacturers and other WORKING PEOPLE who carry this economy.</p>
<p>3.  Teachers are generally ineffective, yet &#8220;earn&#8221; an average base income of $70k+ per year.</p>
<p>4.  Here is my favorite:  Jails in Orange County, my home, are overloaded with inmates (vast majority Mexican), mainly so the county can charge the state $1500 per day per inmate.  When inmates are released, the County officially waits until 12:01AM so that they can charge the state another day.</p>
<p>5.  Again, Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputies earn an average $100k+ per year, which is the biggest joke of all.  There are more drugs in jail than on the streets thanks to crooked deputies (as if they don&rsquo;t already earn enough).  Look up the former Orange County Sheriff, Mike Carona.  He&rsquo;s not a &#8220;bad apple.&#8221;  He&rsquo;s just a very average corrupt California law enforcement official.</p>
<p>6.  Here&rsquo;s the back breaker for the state.  All of the teachers, &#8220;firefighters&#8221; (come on, what burns down anymore? fender-bender over-responders would be more accurate&hellip; ever see 5 hook-and-ladders for a dented door panel?), sheriffs, cops, judges, etc., etc. retire on 95% of their fat income at age 50.  Plus, these institutions are receptacles for every quota program that ever existed.</p>
<p>I am with the governor.  This state is about to collapse&hellip; BRING IT ON.</p>

			<p>Good thing they got that liberal Democrat Gray Davis out of office and replaced him with a fine, upstanding, decent, conservative Republican like Gov. Hamandegger.</p>
<p>Do some of you on this forum still vote for The Stupid Party?</p>

			<p>It is the ever-increasing numbers of non-Whites that have ruined California. As recently as 1970 California was 80% White. Those numbers seem like a impossible dream today&hellip;.</p>

<p>Sounding off on these boards allows everyone a chance to vent their frustration with a system that most of us know is broke. That is somewhat therapeutic but it is wrong and serves no purpose to spew comments that are not founded on fact.</p>
<p>I am a 59 year old teacher in California wrapping up my 22nd year in the profession. It has been a second career for me. I hope to be able to retire at 62. Using STRS (Cal. State Teachers Retirement System) formula, in three more years, I may retire with approximately 40%-45% of my current take home pay. AND, let me assure you, I DO NOT GET MEDICAL! Some school districts may offer medical, but not mine.<br>
You stated, &#8220;Teachers are generally ineffective, yet &ldquo;earn&rdquo; an average base income of $70k+ per year.&#8221;<br>
You are right about teacher&rsquo;s being &#8220;generally ineffective&#8221;, but for the most part it&rsquo;s usually due more to the horse not being willing to drink from the trough as opposed to the teacher not being able to find the trough.<br>
average base income of $70k+ per year. (chuckles!)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep our focus.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Adios, California. You asked for it, and you&rsquo;re going to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by ice at 10:49 PM on April 16 </p>
<p>This is so wrong, California did not ask for it.  Californians voted to not pay for free education and health care during Wilson&rsquo;s tenure, but it got overturned due to interferrence from Hispanic lobbies filing lawsuits.  California was very much taken outright from Americans.  The same thing is happening in many other states.  So I guess you&rsquo;d better be prepared to say &#8220;adios&#8221; to most of America - if not all of it.  I think it completely non-productive to endulge in the old &#8220;hate California&#8221; reflex that I detect in this post.  And as for strategic planning - it is never intelligent to cede anything in a struggle, even if it is only serving as a buffer zone.</p>
