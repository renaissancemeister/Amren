			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Gheen, Americans for Legal Immigration (Alipac), April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>[<em>View the videos of the disruption of Rep. Tancredo&rsquo;s talk <a href="/videos/20090414tancredo/index.html"><b><u><big>here</big></u></b></a></a></em>.] </p>
<p>Tonight, I traveled to UNC Chapel Hill to hear retired Congressman Tom Tancredo speak about why he opposes the Dream Act Amnesty and in-state tuition for illegals. His views are representative of the vast majority of Americans on these issues as illustrated by numerous polls. </p>
<p>I never got to hear Congressman Tancredo speak, neither did the thirty plus other people who gathered in room 103 in Bingham Hall. </p>
<p>I was running late to the event, which was to start at 6:30pm. I arrived around 6:45 and as I entered Bingham Hall, I immediately pulled out my video camera to film the conflict between pro-illegal alien protesters and police outside door of the meeting room. </p>
<p>The meeting room had become packed, as protesters filled the seats in the back of the room. Police refused to let anymore protesters enter for safety reasons and when they did that, the pro-illegal alien protesters made physical contact with the officers. </p>
<p>Officers deployed pepper spray and activated a hand held taser, although they did not use it on anyone. </p>
<p>I briefly filmed the altercation and then entered the room to find Congressman Tancredo sitting at the front of the room calmly. Those who had come to hear him speak had dismayed, worried, and agitated looks on their faces because the illegal alien supporters were intent upon trying to disrupt the meeting and prevent him from speaking by shouting obscenities, screaming &#8220;racist&#8221;, and chanting. </p>
<p>Most of the protesters were younger and many were from the UNC campus Hispanic groups. Among their ranks were some students that had a style of dress and hair styles similar to many of the anarchist groups seen around campuses. </p>
<p>I entered and greeted Tom and then I went to find a seat but found the braying protesters to be highly disrespectful and anti-American in their attempts to suppress free speech in the room. </p>
<p>So I raised my voice and asked them to calm down. It took them by surprise for a second, but I explained that this was America and that free speech cannot be attacked using mob rule tactics. When I explained that UNC was my Alma matter and that their actions here would reflect poorly on the University, things calmed down for a few minutes. </p>
<p>Some Hispanic students came up to the front and said that this affects them and that they want to be heard too. </p>
<p>Congressman Tancredo was so polite and so tolerant. He told them that he would certainly let them speak as long as they showed him the same respect. He told the crowd that they could certainly shout him down and stop him from speaking if they chose, but that many had gathered to hear him and that he wanted to proceed. </p>
<p>While things were calming down in the meeting room, you could hear protesters out in the hallways being held at bay by police and they were banging on drums or something similar to try and create enough noise to disrupt the meeting. </p>
<p>There were some older adults in the ranks of the protesters near the back of the room who appeared to be the ring leaders. I hope that we can identify them from the videos to determine if they are UNC employees or merely old school leftist radicals from outside of the campus. </p>
<p>As Congressman Tancredo started speaking, two anarchist looking girls stood up and unfolded a long banner that read &#8220;No One Is Illegal&#8221; and many in the crowd sighed and said come on now. Tancredo said that signs were fine and he tried to continue. </p>
<p>Then after a few seconds the two girls winked at each other to give the signal and they moved directly in front of Tancredo putting the sign up physically on his face. Tom tried to pull the sign out of his way and while that altercation took place, the large glass window to the right of Tancredo was shattered by protesters outside of the building. </p>
<p>Luckily, there was a blind in place but the glass did rain down on two students who were there to hear Mr. Tancredo speak. </p>
<p>Police rushed in and the event organizers rushed Congressman Tancredo out of the room. The campus security said the event was over, yet I asked them to secure the building and let it go on. I explained that a broken window was of little cost compared to the value of free speech in America and that the university was setting a dangerous precedent by allowing protesters to silence any view with a broken window. </p>
<p>The security officer in charge understood what I was saying but it became clear that his officers did not have control of the building nor the grounds around the building. </p>
<p>Supporters and protesters alike began to file out of the room. One of the protesters tried to ram his shoulder into me as he passed me, but I did not engage him because I was filming what was happening and telling the protesters that they were not the first group to smash out windows of those they hated. </p>
<p>I kept looking at that broken window and images of bricks thrown through the windows of black families and black churches ran through my mind along with images of Jewish store fronts shattered by the Hitler youth. </p>
<p>As we were all leaving the room the protesters set off the fire alarm in the building and they regrouped outside to march with their banners outside of the building in front of many onlookers. </p>
<p>I looked around but could not find any of the event organizers or people I knew. I filmed for a few minutes and went to the side of the building. </p>
<p>About six people in different groups thanked me for coming and trying to settle the protesters down and secure the meeting. </p>
<p>Three black girls who appeared to be students were talking next to me as I spoke to a couple who shook my hand. I told these students that I was ashamed that in my nation there were people willing to destroy free speech by using violence like this. </p>
<p>One of the black girls looked at me, with what felt like sheer hatred and she said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not from this country. You can have it!&#8221; </p>
<p>So many students are turned down by UNC Chapel Hill each year. I remember how proud and excited my family was when I was admitted as a Freshman in 1987. I was one of only four people from my High School that got in that year. So tell me, why is this top University in America have seats filled with foreigners who hate America? </p>
<p>I walked to the offices of the student newspaper, the Daily Tarheel. I met with a reporter there and told him what happened. I told him I wanted it known how embarrassed I was for my old University and how shameful it was that groups in such a place of higher learning were willing to use mob rule tactics like violence, assault, and destruction of property to silence those they disagree with. It certainly does not sound like &#8220;diversity&#8221; to me. </p>
<p>I also told the student paper that we would be very interested in the UNC administration&rsquo;s response to this incident. I explained that if UNC was a breeding ground for this kind of violent and anti-American radicalism, then our education system has truly failed and NC taxpayers should have that in mind during the legislative budgeting process. </p>
<p>I have returned home to Raleigh, NC now and aside from a few whiffs of pepper spray, I am physically fine. But the hatred, aggression and violence that I saw today at UNC Chapel Hill was a real eye opener. These illegal aliens and their supporters have no respect for the freedoms and principles once so cherished in the United States. </p>
<p>UNC Chapel Hill and the surrounding towns in Orange, County are known as the most liberal areas in my home state. While I know that most American students at UNC will not approve of what the protesters did, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how much the local liberal politics of Chapel Hill contributed to the enraged mob that lashed out today. </p>
<p>Long ago, I was once a fashionably liberal young freshman at UNC-Chapel Hill myself and my personal experiences tell me that many of those in the violent mob tonight have been both misinformed and heavily indoctrinated. </p>
<p>The illegal aliens and their supporters had big smiles on their faces after the building was damaged, the false fire alarm was triggered, and Tancredo had left the area. You could clearly see they were jubilant and feeling victorious, as if their suppression of free speech and uncivilized conduct had won them some great victory. </p>
<p>This was no victory for any American. What happened at UNC Chapel Hill tonight was a disgrace to the University, the UNC System, the town of Chapel Hill, and the state of North Carolina. For those who came to the event to speak out on behalf of illegal aliens and their desire for the Dream Act Amnesty and in-state tuition, the message they sent will harm their cause. </p>
<p>Those who used violence to triumph over free speech and the freedom to assemble will find that their cause will be both rejected and rebuked by the vast majority of Americans who find such savagery speaks ill of both the perpetrators and their issues.<br>

			<p>  I watched the video and it is easy to see just how far our once-great country has fallen. If that was my kid, I&rsquo;d cut off her tuition, bring her home, and put her out on her own. But then, more than likely, this was the way she was raised. I was referring to the girl out front, clapping her hands, chanting the communist manifesto she was taught to chant. I am ashamed of this country, it&rsquo;s people, and what it stands for today. I&rsquo;m torn between leaving it, and making a stand to try to save it. I feel sorry for the generations to come. They will live in a slum country of self-hating white people on the verge of extinction. They will be brainwashed to worship all things non-white. This whole mess makes me want to puke. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Hallway blocked by Nineteen year old girls&#8221; Say what? Blocked how exactly?!?&hellip;. The other thing that annoyed me was hearing of the meeting be cancelled over broken glass from a window. Congratulations!! You`ve just taught the protesters that to shut down any future meeting all they need to do is start breaking windows. Bad plan!</p>

			<p>In many of today&rsquo;s universities students learn political correctness, methods of agitation and intolerance, hatred for the United States, and left-wing myths in American history. It is no accident that many of the school&rsquo;s programs are supported by far-left contributions that form a public-private partnership with a goal to move the US into socialism.  A major step towards this goal is the radicalization of students.  Even in high school parents have discovered that some textbooks present leftist myths and actively teach against the US. At the university level the pernicious unintended consequence of tenure makes it almost impossible to remove a faculty member for incompetence or using his classroom for political indoctrination. The bottom line is that our school systems are turning students into socially engineered cogs in the New World Order.</p>

			<p>Not one mention of this in the MSM.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s speech yesterday morning had one very interesting and telling sentence in it; &#8220;We will create&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; a system where anyone from ANYWHERE can come here with a good idea and pursue the &#8220;American Dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that it is being stolen from legal, native born Americans and given away for the sake of the multicultural lie and cheaper labor.  And in the practical context a &#8220;good idea&#8221; seems to be an anchor baby.  Any system that relies on essentially a slave labor (cheap worker) underclass cannot be sustained in the long run.</p>

			<p>If and when Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, they will experience extreme discrimination and violence at the hands of offspring of post-1965 non-whites&hellip;many who came into America Legally. And this brings to my next point. This news item comes from Republican party operative William Gheen&rsquo;s organization which fanatically supports LEGAL NONWHITE post-1965 immigration. Gheen can not be aware that post-1965 nonwhite LEGAL immigrants are stealing jobs from Native Born White American Males through such program as the H-1 B visa program and the L-1 visa programs and asian LEGAL immigration in general. so ask the following question:whose side is Gheen on? What is the nature of the game he is playing.</p>
<p>The only conclusion that I can draw is that Gheen is on board with the racial transformation of America via post-1965 LEGAL immigration policy&hellip;.as long as it is done LEGALLY it is quite alright.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how groups that demand &#8220;tolerance&#8221; from others show none themselves for other viewpoints. And why is it always perceived as a racial issue when American taxpayers oppose illegal immigration? </p>
<p>I see it as an issue which affects my pocketbook. Why should we pay for free meals, tutoring, and after-school daycare for the anchor babies of people who broke the law and came here illegally? I know for a fact that the same students who receive these benefits at taxpayer expense have cable TV, the latest video game systems, and weekend trips to Disneyland at $60 per person. More amazingly, these families continue to have children they cannot afford and expect us to pay their expenses. Yet, when we oppose this, we&rsquo;re &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t read a word about this attack on free speech in the SPLC&rsquo;s <i>Intelligencer</i>.  To the best of my knowledge no meeting by La Raza, LULAC or MEChA has ever been disrupted by White Nationalists.  (I&rsquo;m sure that in their heart of hearts Mo and Heidi wish that that wasn&rsquo;t so   &mdash;   they could raise millions more with headlines about the grave threats to our freedoms posed by race realist whites.)  To be sure I doubt there will be any mention of this incident in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, CBS, ABC, or any other organ of the mainstream press.  (Which is why I&rsquo;m happy to hear that the newspapers are losing money, and some are facing bankruptcy.)</p>
<p>The hatred of the left for free speech is nothing new.  Listen to the debate between Jared Taylor and Jose Angel Gutierrez linked on the right of this page.  At the end Gutierrez says that Taylor should be in prison   &mdash;   simply for stating the views that he has.<br>

			<p>Completely disrespectful.  This is what 18-22 year olds are being taught?  That if they don&rsquo;t like someone&rsquo;s point of view that it&rsquo;s okay to disrupt them, intimidate them, and destroy property?  </p>

			<p>I enjoyed this article by William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration, but, he runs to the local college newspaper afterward? I worked for a college newspaper in the early 1990&rsquo;s and it was a veritable den of student activists. Rush Limbaugh, on his TV show, when he had one, once said, &#8220;Our college newspapers are run by communists&#8221;. I was personally glad to hear him confirm what I suspected. Not that this is needed. Reporting the news on campus pretty much consists of covering pro-diversity organisations and events, with the exception of &#8216;controversial&rsquo; speakers like Tancredo on rare occasions. </p>
<p>I would have to agree with ending the event. The odds would be extremely thin, but there&rsquo;s always the possibility this could have turned out to be an attempt on Tancredo&rsquo;s life. Do ex-congressmen have secret service protection? How about &#8216;controversial&rsquo; ones?</p>

<p>No denying that. The left has almost complete control of the American education system (and the media). This is why you have so many young people with liberal views. No doubt many will eventually see the light as Mr Gheen did. In the mean time our country is going down the tubes. The left gained control of the American education system. What is to stop the right from wrestling control back from them? Or at least gaining an equal share of control? To have a university faculty composed of 95% or more leftist prof&rsquo;s and a paltry 5% conservatives is suicide. And many schools do indeed have that ratio. These radical prof&rsquo;s poison the young minds placed before them. All to promote their marxist doctrine. WE MUST STOP THIS INSANITY!!!</p>

			<p>We need to stop whining and prepare to fight back. Literally. The student organization that sponsored this event should have had their own members prepared and armed with truncheons and willing to protect themselves.  Instead, they look like toothless cowards. I don&rsquo;t care if Tancredo himself didn&rsquo;t want to fight back and was ready to duck and run. If our side doesn&rsquo;t stand up and protect themselves and their rights, they&rsquo;ll be squashed like insects.</p>

			<p>The people to really blame for this kind of nonsense are the low life spineless University Presidents and chancellors who never take the kind of precautions needed to preclude this mob behavior. Hiding under the pretense of diversity and tolerance they will not, for instance, threaten as they should, disruptive students with expulsion. In fact, I would imagine disruptive students can be arrested and charged with assault. </p>

			<p>     Conservatives continue to be stupid. They should know that things like this are going to happen because we no longer live in a civilized society. They should have had their own good squad ready to counter these creeps. At the Orlando Tea Party today there was one guy, obviously a plant, who was wearing a t-shirt calling Obama the n-word. He was quickly surrounded by members of the crowd before the tv cameras could take a picture of it. I&rsquo;m sorry, folks, but it&rsquo;s time to fight fire with fire.</p>

			<p>These kids wanting this shut down and chanting &#8220;no racist in our town&#8221; are the spoiled brat kids who apparently don&rsquo;t know what having a house and a mortgage is. They obviously have NO IDEA about illegal immigration and the problems it has caused this country so they attack free speech and show us what will happen to anyone expressing an opinion that is different than theirs. Do you ever see us anti illegal immigrant people acting like this? It&rsquo;s always these whack jobs. Their freedom of speech is actually totalism.</p>
<p>Illegal Immigration has totally transformed our formally quaint town into a little Favala. Law and order and respect for that has been thrown out the window and replaced by Socialist including our own State reps and Selectmen to cowardly to upset the apple cart, to fix the problem and enforce rules. </p>
<p>So we have a bunch of illegal&rsquo;s who are behaving like these whack jobs at this university. The police should have stepped in and ejected these anarchists and proceeded to allow free speech to take over but no, the foxes took over the hen house.<br>

			<p>I think that any future meetings would best be carried out at off-campus locations.  I know some would say that it is giving in to the loons, but you are never going to get fairness or justice at these commie schools.  The loons act like this because they know that the school administration is giving them tacit approval. </p>
<p>I was just reading about the so-called RNC Welcoming Committee, the group of anarchists that disrupted the Republican Convention in Saint Paul last summer.  University officials at the local school were involved in the planning months ahead of the event.  These tactics are well planned and repeated over and over again in various places.  Mr. Tancredo did not get to speak again.  The students lost out on their rights of free speach and the commie masterminds in the school faculty got what they wanted.</p>
<p>If Mr. Tancredo had gone off campus he would have been off out of the college&rsquo;s jurisdiction.  Instead of the college cops he would have been protected by the real police.  I think he would have had a better chance at getting some proper protection.  If they followed them to the off campus venue and committed some property damage there, the goons would have to deal with the property owner who would not be indulgent as the school faculty would be.  The lefty faculty does not care if the windows get broken because it is not their money.  If the young goons broke a window at a local hall, the owner would go after them.</p>
<p>I think that getting the venue off campus would take away the protection that the young goons are getting from the faculty and could mean that some of the punks would actually spend a night in jail.  Going off campus would call their bluff.</p>

			<p>European immigrants are being wilfully discriminated against as they are a small minority of immigrants.  Since they said that immigration is supposed to be about family reunification how is it that there are not more Europeans coming here since most of the families here are of European origin.</p>

			<p>I feel bad, as I went to Rep. Tancredo&rsquo;s University of Chicago event prepared to do battle with assorted Red, Reconquista types, no such luck - very quite night. Tom Tancredto is a great guy, Italian American - the best. Still I was prepared for battle and there would have been some REds, Latrinos missing some teeth, but they chose to not attend.</p>
<p>So why didn&rsquo;t North Carolina patriots fight back?</p>
<p>Too busy playing golf?</p>

			<p>To repeat what I previously said about moving these meetings off campus: you won&rsquo;t get fairness on a college campus.  You have to take things out of their jurisdiction.  And don&rsquo;t count on campus police, they are nothing more than mall cops.  They are paid by the leftist college officials. They are not going to bite the hand that feeds them.</p>
<p>Please no more events on campus.  Take it off campus and you will call the leftists&rsquo; bluff.  Don&rsquo;t let them have the upper hand.  Some people have talked about bringing weapons for self defence, but then the people from our side would go to jail.  These leftists are shameless liars. The school administration would turn against you and you would be in deep trouble.  No just take the meetings off campus and you will deprive them of their power.</p>

			<p>What is it about &#8220;illegal,&#8221; as in &#8220;illegal alien,&#8221; that these left-wing imbeciles do not understand?  We used to be a country founded on the rule of law, not the outbursts and violence of a rabble mob.  We must turn and fight, literally, as Deporter has written above.  Let the politicians that &#8220;run&#8221; this country continue to debate topics around the conference table.  The time for discussion is long past; it&rsquo;s time to take decisive action. Let us harken to the words of Prince Von Bismarck of long ago: <br>
&#8220;Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided &hellip;.. but by iron and blood.&#8221; </p>

			<p>No &#8220;Joe&#8221;at11:43PM.The &#8220;weasels&#8221; have taken over the hen house.This is another story that you will never see on the MSM.Thank you once again AmRen (you radical right wingers you)for keeping us informed.Some posters here have said &#8220;fight back&#8221;.That sounds good on paper my friends,but how exactly would you do that? Any right wing conservative group on any campus in any state in America are automatically outnumbered.Would you have them come armed? The leftist lunatics would love that,wouldn&rsquo;t they?If that were to happen I think we all know the result.Then there would be 24/7 MSM coverage for sure.The wheels are in motion already.&#8221;Janet&#8221; is making a list and she&rsquo;s checking it twice,she&rsquo;s gonna find out who&rsquo;s naughty or nice.It will be increasingly difficult for anyone to voice their opposing viewpoints.I foresee in the very near future these &#8220;events&#8221; won&rsquo;t even be permitted at all.All of these idiot students should be expelled.I suspect nothing will be done to them.Thank you AmRen.for giving us a voice.I suppose I&rsquo;m on the &#8220;LIST&#8221; now for being a patriotic,Christian,conservative,natural born American.Teach your children well.   </p>

			<p>Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? The immigrant protesters can&rsquo;t condemn our country enough&hellip; for wanting to keep it from degenerating into a third-world country&hellip; yet can&rsquo;t resist streaming into our country in droves.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, ANYONE who does not like our America&hellip; is more than welcomed to leave! (The sooner, the better for our country.)</p>

			<p>The truth is, the university administration tacitly supports this kind of Brownshirtish thug behavior. This is bad enough, however the MSM either ignore left wing political violence, or, if they do report on it, do it with a kind of whimsy, and in a non judgmental, non-serious, or dumbed down fashion.</p>
<p>The quotes are from ABC11, Chapel Hill News: &#8220;There are two questions following a rowdy student protest at UNC Chapel Hill Tuesday night. Did the protest get out of line and did campus police go too far?&#8221; </p>
<p>First, to describe left wing political violence as a &#8220;rowdy student protest&#8221; is to minimize the repressive nature of the act.  The description evokes images of an &#8220;innocent&#8221; drunken frat party.</p>
<p>Second, the MSM pretends not to understand the &#8220;line&#8221; demarcating the boundary of political protest v. violence.  This is despicable for a news outlet whose raison d&rsquo;etre is based on the First Amendment, and our tradition that political speech is a right held by the people.  But they play dumb, and pretend that suppression of political speech is open to honest debate, and, hence, that this particular example of goon thuggery COULD be within acceptable bounds.</p>
<p>Third, the MSM questions whether the minimal attempt by the police to maintain some semblance of order was justified.  The left wing goons (none of whom were arrested or harmed in any way) are now possible victims of repressive police action!</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who went to hear him speak were clearly upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the use of the descriptive.  &#8220;Upset&#8221; is typically an immature and unfounded emotional response to a random life event.  I doubt those who experienced this act of political intimidation were merely upset.  But it is another way for the MSM to minimize the true nature of the incident.</p>
<p>The idea that UNC (or almost any school, for that matter) upholds the importance of honest and free inquiry is a sad joke.  The administration, the faculty, the radicalized students, and their toadies in the MSM are quite transparent about their disdain for academic, political, and intellectual freedom.</p>

			<p>If you pay taxes, you are already a slave, albeit a financial slave. I have been a financial slave for 40 years and it has gotten old. In light of this,I have wondered for some time if these illegal aliens who are so very ready to take White Americans for anything and every thing, from food, to housing (which they ultimately destroy)have even once stopped to think of who will pay the bills when they manage to get rid of White Americans with,their brains and creativity. What will they do for food? Shelter? Tattooes? Ear loops? Beer? Nikes?<br>
  We are headed in the same direction as South Africa. Some races are not meant to lead. They cannot build, only take for free or steal the results of the labor and genius of the White Race. As Daniel Webster stated, &#8220;Hold on, my friends, to the Constitution and to the Republic for which it stands. Miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in 6000 years may not happen again. Hold on to the Constitution, for if the American Constitution should fail, there will be anarchy throughout the world.&#8221; What he failed to say was that some races are simply not suited to deal appropriately with law of any kind. Like small children, the more one lets them get away with it, the worse it becomes.The world is in the predicted chaos which Webster predicted. </p>

<p>This is true and anyone interested in reading the real story on how this came about ought to find a copy of Norman Cantor&rsquo;s &#8220;Inventing the Middle Ages.&#8221;  The section on French Jewish historian Marc Bloch has the answer to the riddle.  But it is not what you would expect - Bloch tried to correct his earlier misinformation about communism - to no avail.  It was his martyrdom after being betrayed to the Nazis by a jealous colleague in Paris that created the huge spread of the already existing set of ivy league idolitors.</p>

<p>I know it was already really bad by the 60s and 70s. The hippies, the counter-culture made it the &#8220;thing to do&#8221; on campus. If you weren&rsquo;t a radical, a leftist, you weren&rsquo;t &#8220;with it&#8221;.  It must be beyond imagining today!<br>

			<p>As time goes on, and it seems like things are only getting worse, I appear to be faced with just one option here in America.</p>
<p>Complete apathy - if my white brothers in the U.S. want to sit back and do nothing as our race withers away and our country is colonized (at least some european countries have viable ethnic nationalist parties!), then they can wallow in the hellhole they&rsquo;ve created, I simply won&rsquo;t shed a tear.  </p>
<p>Honestly I feel like if I keep caring about this sort of thing I&rsquo;m going to end up depressed or dead, which is sad considering I&rsquo;m only 20.</p>

This type of anarchist left is as doomed as it was in Spain in the Civil War. I should add though it is good entertainment in the meantime. I call it the &#8220;Angry Aztec Show&#8221;.   What a pathetic slogan&hellip;No One is Illegal. Are they crying in their Coronas or what?  This is power? <br>
The national fascists in China,  disciplined and the connected to their nation&rsquo;s cause, represent true power. They are ascendant and worth fearing. <br>
As a British comedian, I think it was Peter Sellars, cracked when told that a person he was talking to was from Latin America : &#8220;Well, which country is it? The one with the wretched poverty, the bloody civil war, or the one with the fancy hats?&#8221;</p>

			<p>I think it might be worth keeping in mind that, for readers of Amren who have families, college might not be too appealing to your children since they have - I assume - been exposed to the truth about what goes on there. Nevertheless, we should make sure our children are able to tackle our country&rsquo;s cultural problems when they grow up, and to do this they will need to be educated. Whenever I point out the problems in our colleges I am sure to also point out that a good education is a necessity. If you are ignorant and inarticulate, you are going to have a tough time transforming society. But don&rsquo;t let your teachers indoctrinate you!</p>

			<p>I do not understand why parents are so anxious to spend tens of thousands of dollars to send their kids off to college.  To get drunk and pick up a case of herpes along with  their noxious attitudes?  I recommend that all Whites send their kids to trade schools when they leave high school.  Have them spend a couple years at the local jr college studying auto repair or cooking or business, and maybe taking some math or science classes, along with a part time job.  They can spend a few years after that doing useful labor, and then, if they wish, they can go to college.  Instead of entering college as a 19 year old ignoramus, your kid is a young man or woman of 22 or 24, much better prepared to resist the tsunami of lies.  <br>
     If you haven&rsquo;t reared your children to expect this, they may see it as a betrayal, but you have to be firm.  It&rsquo;s your money and your decision, and you have changed your mind.  Do they really think that mommy and daddy owe them four years at a pseudo-academic resort?  If, after some time in the work force, they still want to go to college, support them, modestly.  Since you&rsquo;re paying, insist on seeing their class schedule and their grades.  Make sure that they&rsquo;re doing something worthwhile.  My brother-in-law gave his daughter a credit card, to monitor her purchases.<br>
     The purpose of a college is to turn our children into pathetic quivering worms, enemies of civilization and slaves to multicultural Marxism.  Why would anyone who loves their child spend 18 years feeding and caring for her, and then turn her over to these monsters?  <br>
