<h1>State Democrats Despoil Democracy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Graham, Boston Herald, April 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The election of President Barack Obama was supposed to usher in a post-racial and post-partisan America. But who knew that some Massachusetts Democrats dreamed of a post-American America?</p>
<p>Rep. Pam Richardson of Framingham wants the Massachusetts Democratic Party to advocate voting rights for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>You read that right. A handful of liberal Massachusetts towns already allow legal resident aliens to vote in local elections. But Richardson wants illegal immigrants canceling out your vote for school committee and town selectman.</p>
<p>And she wants the state Democratic Party to lead the way.</p>
<p>Last month, at a local party platform meeting in Framingham, Richardson looked into a video camera and bemoaned the unfairness of the crimmigrants&rsquo; plight:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a large population of people living here who don&rsquo;t have the same rights and opportunities of the rest of us,&#8221; she complained. &#8220;I&rsquo;m talking about undocumented immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea of extending the right to vote to non-citizens is disconcerting enough. But to make legal voters from criminal aliens is beyond belief for the typical American.</p>
<p>The question is, does the idea offend the Massachusetts Democratic Party?</p>
<p>Richardson says it&rsquo;s the Democrats&rsquo; job to be the &#8220;voice of the voiceless&#8221; in this case. Rep. Tom Sannicandro (D-Ashland) has already proposed legislation for one of her kooky ideas  &mdash;  driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegals.</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s up to the state party to decide if they agree with the idea that American citizenship should be irrelevant in Massachusetts politics. It may sound crazy to you, but at the platform meeting in Framingham, Richardson received a rousing ovation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But think for a moment of that blue-collar worker who has lost his construction job to illegal immigration; whose property taxes rise to provide services for those working off the tax rolls; and who then finds himself standing in line behind an undocumented-but-legally-registered voter casting ballots on a tax override.</p>
<p>He votes no. The illegal immigrant votes yes. The override passes, and he&rsquo;s told to accept the results because &#8220;the people have spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Look at her picture.  She is the type that these immigrants like to rape.  Unfortunately, it will be the innocent white females that are raped, not Pam Richardson.</p>

Hey, here&rsquo;s some other ideas. Why don&rsquo;t we leave our houses and let illegal aliens move in? Why not empty our bank accounts and give them the money? Why not quit our jobs and give them to illegals as well?</p>
<p>I bet Ms. Richardson could come up with a lot more innovative and progressive ideas if she put her two brain cells together.</p>
<p>What these people want is a world without standards and rules. After all, no one should be forced to live by community standards or follow arbitrary rules. Standards and rules amount to hate crimes.</p>

			<p>Who is to say that a post-racial America and a post-American America aren&rsquo;t the same thing?  If we can&rsquo;t discriminate based on the race of citizens, then why discriminate against people because they&rsquo;re not citizens?  Heck, let&rsquo;s extend it one step further   &mdash;   we shouldn&rsquo;t discriminate against illegal aliens just because they haven&rsquo;t been willing or able to enter the U.S.   &mdash;   just give everyone on Earth a vote in Massachusetts elections.</p>

This traitor is the reason I no longer believe in Democracy. It&rsquo;s a system in which votes can be bought and in which citizens of a country are sold out in favor of non-citizens simply because a political party wants the votes of these non-citizens and the power that comes with that vote.</p>

			<p>Is this woman too compassionate for her own good, or is she the kind of person who likes to stand up on a hill with a bullhorn and shout about how decent and caring she is? Is she just stupid?</p>
<p>Immigrants, legal or illegal, don&rsquo;t need a political voice. They came to this country - voluntarily, I would add. Even so-called refugees pass, on their way to the US, a dozen or so countries geographically closer and culturally more similar to their own while on the way to the United States. They came here because they wanted to. If they have problems with the current political conditions then they probably shouldn&rsquo;t stay. They&rsquo;d like it better elsewhere.</p>

			<p>What Pam Richardson fails to realize is, that once minorities get the right to vote, they want to vote their own into office. Maybe we will see her, Uncle Teddy and Elmer Fudd all voted out of office. Since one no longer has to be a natural born US citizen to be president, maybe we will see the first illegal non-citizen as president.</p>

			<p>Using liberal logic, those that have broken our laws deserve a vote, maybe those that have never been here (and their-by not broken the law) should get 2 votes?</p>

			<p>What do you expect?  This is the state that keeps inflicting Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank on our country.  The Democrats know that not enough white people will vote for them.  That&rsquo;s why they are so keen to give illegal immigrants citizenship, and even let them vote without citizenship.<br>
