<h1>Feds Hit Rev. Al with Record 285G Elex Fine</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Isabel Vincent, New York Post, April 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network have been slapped with a record $285,000 fine for violating a slew of federal election rules during his 2004 bid for president, the Post has learned. </p>
<p>In a decision to be made public next month, the Federal Election Commission found that Sharpton&rsquo;s Democratic primary campaign accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from private sources. </p>
<p>It also &#8220;kept poor records of its activities and expenditures&#8221; and commingled funds with Sharpton&rsquo;s civil-rights group. All are prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sharpton and former campaign manager Andrew Rivera signed an agreement with the FEC to pay the fine  &mdash;  among the highest in the regulatory body&rsquo;s 34-year history. </p>
<p>&#8220;Sharpton 2004 materially misstated its receipts and disbursements, as well as cash on hand in 2004,&#8221; says the April 8 FEC report, which followed an investigation of the Sharpton campaign&rsquo;s expenses. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At one point, Sharpton racked up $509,188 in campaign expenses on his American Express card. His campaign committee paid $121,996, according to the FEC, but the bulk was paid by the National Action Network and two private corporations controlled by Sharpton. A further $65,000 was paid by unknown sources, the FEC investigation found. </p>
<p>Sharpton also received &#8220;excessive in-kind contributions&#8221; from La-Van Hawkins, a wealthy supporter and principal of the now-defunct Hawkins Food Group. </p>
<p>{snub} </p>
<p>According to an earlier audit, Sharpton was to pay a $500,000 penalty.<br>

			<p>     If you or I did this we would be in prison. Like Obama&rsquo;s cronies, he&rsquo;ll say it was all a misunderstanding and get away scot free.</p>

			<p>People will still continue to contribute to him because he&rsquo;s a version of the African village&rsquo;s Big Man.  Basically, blacks love to have an oppressor grind their boot into their face, so they flock to their abusive ministers, abusive politicians, and abusive civil rights leaders.</p>

			<p>That fine is a drop in the bucket to the 100&rsquo;s of millions he gets in extortion fees from wimpy CEO&rsquo;s who will gladly pay him off and hire his incompetent blacks, so long as they get their 400 million dollars in bonuses for selling out their race and their country.<br>

			<p>Amex gave Sharpton a 500k credit line? I guess they don&rsquo;t call him &#8220;shakedown Al&#8221; for nothing!</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s irresponsible financial risks like this, and lending to blaks in general that caused the credit crisis and collapse in the first place. I hope everyone has learned their lesson</p>

<p>So do Glaciers, but as we all know, every one of us living today will be long dead before any results show up. Same thing with ANY action against such a &#8220;civil rights Icon&#8221; as the Al</p>
