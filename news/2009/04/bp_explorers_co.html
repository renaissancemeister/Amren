<h1><a href="/articles/2009/03/29/news/doc49cf24af59892954619631.txt">BP Explorers Collect Trash Left by Illegal Immigrants in the Huachucas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Derek Jordan, Sierra Vista (Arizona) Herald, March 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of teenagers hiked out here on Saturday morning to collect trash left over from illegal immigrant traffic in the area.</p>
<p>The teens were members of a U.S. Border Patrol program out of the Naco station that seeks to teach skills and offer basic training to teenagers who are interested in law enforcement.</p>
<p>One day a week, the U.S. Border Patrol&rsquo;s Naco Station Explorer Program teaches teenagers everything from proper handcuffing and arresting techniques to how to handle firearms and clear a building, said William Schaeck, Border Patrol agent and lead adviser of the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Explorers are required to put in 40 hours of community service before they can graduate from the 12-week training period. The garbage collection was a good opportunity to pare down a few of those hours, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bisbee resident Craig Kost, 19, has been in the Explorer program for about a year. He originally joined up for the structure the program offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to be more disciplined and respectful,&#8221; Kost said.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now thinking about a career with the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>As the group moved deeper and deeper into the brush following the wash, sparse traces of litter  &mdash;  plastic bottles, jackets, empty plastic bags  &mdash;  gave way to hundreds of discarded sweaters, shoes and other articles of clothing.</p>
<p>Border Patrol Agent Nora Cosgrove, who guided the Explorers along with Schaeck, said the group filled 27 large trash bags on the 3-mile trip in about three hours before even reaching the large deposit of discarded garbage.</p>
<p>Already faced with at least three full bags to carry per person the 3 miles back to the vehicles, the group wasn&rsquo;t able to tackle the &#8220;motherlode&#8221; of garbage.</p>
<p>However, now that the location has been established, agents will continue efforts to clean the area up, Cosgrove said.</p>

			<p>The first time I read an article some years ago about all of the garbage left on our southern border by illegals, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It isn&rsquo;t enough that they are causing great harm in so many ways here in the United States, they have to completely trash the border areas besides.</p>
<p>   I was also surprised that groups like the Sierra Club didn&rsquo;t speak out about this trashing of our border until I found out that the Sierra Club accepted a very large donation some years ago from a man who gave it with the condition that they don&rsquo;t talk about immigration and its effect on the environment.</p>
<p>  The Sierra Club took the donation and so now we know how &#8220;sincere&#8221; they are about the environment and why they deliberately look the other way at the great environmental destruction being caused on the border by illegals.</p>

			<p>THIS IS HOW THEY LIVE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, they see nothing wrong with leaving trash, being trash or relieving themselves wherever they happen to be. Isn&rsquo;t diversity GRAND?</p>

			<p>I had an idea/fantasy a few years back to rub the nose of traitor George W. Bush and his clique by collecting tons of this ilegal alien invader garbage - toxic stuff, bag it and transport it to Crawford Texas and dump it on Main street, some golf country club or the Bush estate itself and put the word out that this is where the garbage belongs, as the American president doesn&rsquo;t care if the rest of America gets trashed by the illegal alien invasion, he might as well smell the problem in his luxurious, safe, protected life.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this is still a good idea - so Bush is an ex-president, he should have more time to reflect on the things he did and didn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>However, in accordance with government policy, no effort will be made to stop the passage of illegal aliens into America.</p>

			<p>When illegals are caught, they should be transported to the border and be made to pick up the trash- - chain gang style. Then, when they&rsquo;re done, remove the chains and throw them back over the border. Sounds like a win-win to me!</p>
