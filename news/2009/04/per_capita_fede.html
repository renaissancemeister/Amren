			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Audacious Epigone, Audacious Epigone, April 02, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Commenter Jesuswarehouse helpfully dug up several links, including federal expenditures by state on a host of things. Sifting through them, I&rsquo;ve figured total per capita federal welfare spending  &mdash;  defined here as childhood nutrition programs, food stamp programs, WIC benefits, and TANF benefits  &mdash;  by state. Such a table does not appear to be floating around anywhere else on the web. For that reason, it is presented here. The latest year all necessary figures appear to be available from is 2005. Consequently, all data are from that year:</p>
<div align="left">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="215"><img src="/news/2009/04/07/welfare1.jpg" alt="table"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Vermont&rsquo;s high take stands out, as the state generally fares well on quality-of-life measures. I would have expected it to show similarity to New Hampshire. However, per capita expenditures only weakly correlate* with the usual suspects  &mdash;  with the poverty rate at .33 (p=.02), with the non-Asian minority (NAM) percentage of the population at .22 (p=.13), and inversely with estimated average IQ at .22 (p=.13). Blue states receive a little more than red states do, but a state&rsquo;s political persuasion doesn&rsquo;t reveal much  &mdash;  federal welfare expenditures correlate inversely with Bush&rsquo;s &#8216;04 share of the vote at .24 (p=.09).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are factors other than &#8216;need&rsquo; at work in determining how much the federal government doles out to its tributaries.</p>
<p>A visualization of the table appears below. Data are <a href="https://www.swivel.com/data_sets/spreadsheet/1017822" target="data" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a></p>

			<p>I agree.  It&rsquo;s a combination of race and the liberalness of the state&rsquo;s power structure.  DC has both, while Minnesota has that stereotypical Scandinavian love of big welfare states but not much actual use of it (for now, until all Somalia settles there).  The Deep South isn&rsquo;t as high as its high black population would suggest because they&rsquo;re more conservative fiscally and socially. </p>

			<p>check out D.C.-that says it all, I think the population is only around a quarter mil, wonder what percentage is drawing welfare, probably better than 90%</p>

			<p>It would be to correlate this by red-state/blue-state criteria. Republicans are either heartless, or people who vote Democrat are lazy. </p>

			<p>This is interesting! I noted several things: </p>
<p>New Hampshire pays the least. Could this be due to the fact that NH residents are gainfully employed and don&rsquo;t need welfare? Probably.</p>
<p>It was utterly shocking, however, to see that a GOP state like Arizona beat out Taxachussets!!! </p>
<p>Not surprised at Vermont, since it&rsquo;s run by ex-Hippies and  thinks it&rsquo;s part of Canada and England. I expected Maine to be quite higher on the chart. Not surprised by California but puzzled that it isn&rsquo;t Number 1 (I live in CA). I was a little surprised with Nevada, given that it has Democratic tendencies   &mdash;   but then I remembered that Nevada Dems are usually to the right of Rush Limbaugh. </p>
<p>Alaska surprised me also, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s rating has to deal with the state allotments that residents are given thru oil production revenue? </p>
<p>After this has been made public, I fully expect lilly-white Vermont to be swamped with American blacks, Somalis and Bantus   &mdash;   similar to the way Maine and Minnesota were. </p>

			<p>DC leads the list, this does not surprise me.</p>
<p>In fact it makes all the sense in the world. After all since the purpose of the traitorous Republicrat/Demoncan government is to BUY votes with money extorted from the caucasian taxpayers why wouldn&rsquo;t those closest to the master&rsquo;s house get the largest share of the payoff?<br>

			<p>You have to wonder why VA and MD are ranked so low. It&rsquo;s probably because DC serves as a poverty &#8220;sink&#8221;. If you want gov&rsquo;t goodies, you just mover there. Plus, the whole area is awash in affirmative action gov&rsquo;t jobs.</p>

			<p>I live in Minnesota and can assure you that the vast majority of the &#8216;social problems&rsquo; in our state stem from the populations of color living on white taxpayer dollars mainly in Hennepin County. Section 8 is also drawing these problem populations out to the suburbs but Hennepin County has the highest benefits so the other counties are somewhat shielded from huge problems.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;but then I remembered that Nevada Dems are usually to the right of Rush Limbaugh&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>You mean Nevada Dems such as Harry Reed?  The one who announced that &rsquo; We&rsquo;ve got to stop using fossil fuel!?&rsquo; (Wonder when the lights will go off in Las Vegas).</p>
<p>Speaking (or writing) of Rush and Harry Reed  &mdash;  who remembers the famous smear letter:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When &#8216;Dingy Harry&rsquo; Reid and the U.S. Senate turned away from the business of the nation to instead smear a private citizen, forty-one of them sent a letter demanding the &#8216;repudiation&rsquo; of their inaccurate interpretation of Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s comments about Jesse Al-Zaid&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The smear letter was auctioned off and:</p>
<p>Two million, one hundred thousand, one hundred dollars was the final bid for a 4-page Harry Reid/Rush Limbaugh smear letter which he and forty other United States Congressmen signed.  eBay Auctions has a new record for money raised for a charity, that charity being the Marine Corps - Law Enforcement Association.  Rush Limbaugh matched it with US$2,100,100.00 it was announced&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it any wonder there are loud calls from the senate for the re-implementation of the Fairness Doctrine?  It&rsquo;s called the &#8216;Hush Rush&rsquo; act for a reason.</p>
