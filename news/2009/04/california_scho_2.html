<h1>California School Tries Segregation to Boost Scores</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some parents in a Sacramento suburb are upset after school officials segregated students by race in a move designed to boost test scores.</p>
<p>Students at Laguna Creek High School in Elk Grove were divided by race this week for what the school called &#8220;heritage assemblies.&#8221; The gatherings were designed to motivate students to do better on standardized achievement tests.</p>
<p>That upset Tracy and Herbert Houston, a mixed-race couple who say their son was confused about which rally to attend.</p>
<p>Principal Doug Craig said dividing students by race allowed teachers to talk about test scores without singling out one group in a negative way.</p>
<p>Such race-based assemblies have been practiced in other California schools that are struggling to close student achievement gaps.<br>

Presumably, this should mediate the affects of &#8216;stereotype threat&rsquo;. Or will is exacerbate it?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help it, I really did burst into laughter at that!</p>
<p>I wonder if their little mulatto abomination is &ldquo;confused&rdquo;  about what race he is, when he is harassing some white girl to date him, or if he will be equally &ldquo;confused&rdquo; when seeking a college program to enter?</p>

		<p>I guess people like Tracy and Herbert Houston do have a dilemma. But this is a dilemma they created themselves. It isn&rsquo;t the school&rsquo;s problem. They should sit down as a family unit and work out themselves which assembly their son should attend. The school shouldn&rsquo;t alter it&rsquo;s decision to hold the &#8220;heritage assemblies&#8221; because of the confusion of one boy.</p>

		<p>Did you wonder if the White students had their own assembly?</p>
<p>According to the Sacramento Bee:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Students at Laguna could go to any rally they wanted, but the gatherings were designated for specific races â€“ African Americans in the gym, Pacific Islanders in the theater, Latinos in the multipurpose room&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh that&rsquo;s right, White students are expendable! </p>
<p>Parents of White students should boycott the state tests (legal via written parent permission  &mdash;   the schools try to suppress this information).</p>
<p>Let the test scores reflect the favored black, hispanic and pi students.</p>
<p>Better yet  &mdash;  White parents should boycott entirely the anti-White government schools and home school.</p>

<p>Whites must take their children out of government schools. The government is anti-white and marxist.  Whites were meant to live free.  The government wants us to be serfs and the purpose of government schools is to create serfs.  Government schools cannot be reformed. Blacks and mestizos are happy to be serfs.</p>

<p>One of my mom&rsquo;s co-workers who lives there says she and her husband are now afraid to go to town on weekends, even during the day, because of the ghetto thuggishness.  Another area lost, and unless you are wealthy this type of encroachment is your destiny in California.  </p>

For those of you that weren`t around during the Fall of Saigon, there is a famous sound bite that aptly describes this situation as well. I`m talking about the female Congresswoman who`s first name was Millicent. As the NVA rushed down thru the Highlands of  South Vietnam, our politicians debated rushing arms and airstrikes to the South to restore the situation. <br>
 The lady got before the podium and asked, &#8220;If a half a million troops, trillions upon trillions  of dollars  and battleship after battleship couldn`t save us from this debacle, what good will a dozen B-52`s do?!?&#8221;  So I ask, if 50 years of Head-Start and ten billion dollars  couldn`t do the job, what makes you think 35 minutes in an auditorium will?!?<br>

		<p>Everyone American has to realize that what happened was that in the 1960&rsquo;s many young people were influenced by communist propaganda, became Marxists and deliberately became professors in order to &#8220;change American culture&#8221;. Once they took over the universities, they trained several generations of teachers and journalists, who in turn brainwashed more countless millions, who now control at least half the congress, 90% of all media and 98% of the school system. All those institutions are now factories churning out young people by the millions with an essentially Marxist viewpoint. &#8220;Liberalism&#8221; when compared point by point with classical Marxism is identical. <br>
The critical mass was finally reached, with enough real Americans (those before the brainwashing) dying off and enough new indoctrinated Americans being created, that Obama&rsquo;s Marxist policies now suddenly &#8220;made sense&#8221; to enough Americans to elect him. It only &#8220;made sense&#8221; because they&rsquo;d been &#8220;prepped&#8221; for decades by the media and universities to accept a Marxist worldview. <br>
The only hope to save classical America is to make a total break with Neo Marxist power by refusing to participate in the schools, courts, media, etc. The Media is THE battleground right now. &#8220;He who controls the flow of information&hellip;wins&#8221; Liberals are much better at lying and manipulating people with words. <br>
Real Americans, (conservatives, libertarians, etc.) must realize they are in an all out cultural war and put everything they have into waging Political and Media warfare against the Marxist in the schools, universities and media. If we don&rsquo;t we WILL lose America.  </p>

<p>Huh? Try 100s of billions a couple times over and of course never a thank you to white taxpayers from these ungrateful blacks. </p>
<p>Did any blacks ever say thanks to the millions of whites who fought against those evil racist enslaving whites from the south who had 20% of their pure white race killed off while 70% were injured in some form and property destroyed? </p>
<p>While blacks got all they wanted and then have fed off the fed govt for the past  140 yrs for trillions while taking over the cities and running off the whites and misegenating with whites while whining about everything 24/7 have they offered a thanks as they rape murder pillage rob steal assault? </p>

<p>This is a brilliant idea.  Thanks to NCLB, and similar initiatives, schools are desperate to maintain their test scores.  If whites were to boycott the tests, then it would really leave the school administrators in a hole.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what positive good this would do - but it would positively torment and embarrass the public education establishment, and that can only be to the good.  Can we convince oriental parents to have thier kids opt out too?</p>

This entire thread disgusts me!  My disgust is not at the comments that are made, but that they are right on the money.  I have evoloved to a universal dislike of all things black  &mdash;  and I feel that it&rsquo;s justified!!  <br>
I do not have optimistic feelings about the future of America.  Moreover, I&rsquo;m in agreement with the slug, Holder, that we are &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221;. What&rsquo;s left of America is either brainwashed or terrified of being called a &#8220;right-wing extremist&#8221;.<br>
We can no longer rely upon the political process, because it&rsquo;s run by the media.  <br>
I believe that &#8220;evil prevails when good men and women-do nothing.&#8221;  What is left for us to do??<br>

		<p>Paul- Bingo! You are exactly on target, and because it happens at a generational pace no one will know what is happening until it is too late. Why, for example would a society cherish and uphold activities which would lead to its demise? Abortion and homosexuality for eons have been recognized as destructive to a societies long term survival, but in this upside down world they are promoted. Just frame in the terms of the already discredited Christian religion. What a great way to conquer an implacable foe without firing a shot. Diminish the birth rate to below replacement, and replace the population with less intelligent races.</p>

		<p>Surely it&rsquo;s not a surprise that there are inherent cultural differences between white culture and and black culture??? Western white culture, based on literary and learning, invests heavily in the education of their young. Black culture, by contrast, rears many children, but invests little in their children&rsquo;s upbringing. This contrast in cultures will inevitably result in white society being overwhelmed through sheer numbers and immoral behavior. <br>

		<p>Mr. William Hendershot, this is a website focused on Immigration, and issues of race.  But since you brought up the subjects of abortion and homosexuality, I feel it necessary to say a thing or two.</p>
<p>Disaffected homosexuals in revenge mode against society have been a plague for, as you say &#8216;eons&rsquo;.  We&rsquo;ll start with Abraham Lincoln.  We all know of the deadly mechanisms he unleashed upon our nation.  And considering Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s compulsive exhibitionism before other men, I&rsquo;d say he was also, deep-down, primarily homosexual.  His &#8216;Great Society&rsquo; bankrupted a good portion of my family, and killed the town I grew up in.  J. Edgar Hoover caused immense trouble, as did Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Both were homosexuals who lived in times of severe repression (immigrant-driven, I might add).</p>
<p>Marxism, Communism, and the &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; movement, filled their ranks in America with closeted gays: people who often could not admit their preference, even to themselves.  ALL THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SUPPRESSION OF HOMOSEXUALITY WAS THE CREATION OF A HUGE SUBVERSIVE CLASS, INTENT UPON DESTROYING SOCIETY AS THEY KNEW IT.  If those suppressions had been in place during Colonial times, we might never have had the contributions of George Washington (you can, I&rsquo;m sure, google this issue), or of any of the other founding patriots who, when not founding the nation, busied themselves with decorating their homes. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attacking homosexuals, here, but attacking the pointless and counterproductive practice of antagonizing and tormenting them. Do we want them with us or against us?  If you count bisexuals, that&rsquo;s a big percentage of the populace that&rsquo;s been alienated from conservatism by threats and insults.  We need every man and every woman we can get to be on our side.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the big &#8216;woman&rsquo; issue: Abortion.  How many women do you think vote Democrat only to preserve their (and their daughters&rsquo;) right to a safe and legal abortion?  My guess is that a lot of publicly Republican women secretly vote Democrat&hellip;.no matter WHAT (and I don&rsquo;t mean to say &#8216;whom&rsquo;)they will be helping to place in the Oval Office.  The recent election should be sufficient proof that a huge pool of women put abortion rights above anything else.  Why should we have all those women on the other side&hellip;voting against us?</p>
<p>Please, can we put aside these inconsequential issues that only divide us, and focus on the ONE THING that America and the Western World will not survive?  That one thing we will not survive is having our societies overrun and genetically-swamped by inappropriate immigration.  WE WILL NEVER COME BACK UP, AFTER BEING BROWNED-DOWN.</p>

		<p>Yes, study does improve test scores, and I am all for that.  All students should be encouraged to study as much as is reasonable.  </p>
<p>The problem, however, continues to be the disparate performance of Jews, Northeastern Asians, and Whites on one hand vs. Africans, New World Indians (Hispanics) and southern Asians on the other hand.  This disparity is due to genetic differences in IQ.  Environment can only moderately influence that.  Yet, we spend Billions and Billions on every possible scheme to try to close that academic gap (from Head start to Afro-centric teaching).  What&rsquo;s the point?  Our society would be infinately better off if we directed 1/10 of that funding to fostering gifted children.  Remember, it is those geniuses among us who make the scientific and technical discoveries that propel our civilization (janitors and ditch diggers simply don&rsquo;t make that many new scientific discoveries).  Why spend Trillions of Dollars to improve the reading ability of low IQ children from an 8th grade level to a 10th grade level, when a much smaller investiment in the gifted kids of ALL RACES will have real payoffs for our society?</p>
<p>Finally, the worst aspect is that racial disparity in IQ is blamed on &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Not admitting the true cause of the academic gap leads to useless &#8220;solutions.&#8221;  i.e., we are spending Billions on the wrong cure.  It is time that we admitted what the problem really is, and go on from there.  Heritage Assemblies may stimulate a few hours of increase study, but will not solve the racial gap in academic achievement. Such &#8220;motivational programs&#8221; will not solve the underling problem, and as such are largely a waste of time.  </p>

		<p>To blame &#8220;culture&#8221; is to buy into conspiracy theory. Somehow, somewhere, there are conspirators that keep pushing Blacks and Latinos to adopt pathological cultural traits.</p>
<p>Which is ridiculous. There is no conspiracy. And the Left&rsquo;s favorite conspiracy, White racism, is not holding back Blacks and Latinos either.</p>
<p>What is occurring is the outcome of real genetic difference in population groups. Once that part sinks in, you then understand why we&rsquo;re headed for a rocky future. There&rsquo;s is nothing that can be done to change the average test score numbers. They reflect reality and the bottom line is high IQ produces productivity while low IQ produces banana republics.</p>
<p>Without a course correction, we are going to resemble Latin America in every way imaginable, especially with affirmative action government jobs going to Latin American Indians with IQs of 80 to 85.</p>

		<p>Lauren- It is not meant as an attack, but a statement of fact. Only a slight drop in the birth rate over a few generations results in a population loss. We are presently at or below replacement. This is given as a reason to embrace wide open borders; in order to replace the aging white populace. I do not mean to moralize or condemn, and I agree with you that we need all the brothers in arms we can get in this battle.</p>
<p>However, the constant drumbeat and glorification of homosexuality and abortion has I believe, a hidden agenda. It is meant to lower the prevailing white population.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought so too.  It also splits a portion of the White male population off from the rest of us.  Since they don&rsquo;t have dependent women and children, they have more time to devote to their agenda and anti White activities than do heterosexual men who have wives and children dependent on them.</p>
<p><br>
Another reason for affirmative action for women is to make it difficult for high IQ White women to have children.  </p>
<p>Women physicians have the worst time of it. 8 years of school 6 years of internship and residency, moves across country for college, med school and residency,  a lifetime of paying off those $200,000  student loans. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a chance to breath, let alone find a man, get married and have children till they are 40.  Women attorneys and executives have it a little better, they can start looking for a husband when they are about 30.  But the reality is our most intelligent White women now spend their child bearing years in school and establishing careers. So they have just 1, if they are lucky 2 children.</p>
<p>What Lenin and Stalin could not do to the Russians with violence and gulags, the American communists are doing without a shot being fired or concentration camp being built.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Marxism, Communism, and the &lsquo;Civil Rights&rsquo; movement, filled their ranks in America with closeted gays: people who often could not admit their preference, even to themselves. ALL THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SUPPRESSION OF HOMOSEXUALITY WAS THE CREATION OF A HUGE SUBVERSIVE CLASS, INTENT UPON DESTROYING SOCIETY AS THEY KNEW IT&#8221;</p>
<p>The first homsexual political organization as opposed to private social clubs was the Mattachine Society.  It was founded in 1950 by Harry Hay, a proud member of the American Communist Party who was active in the Presidential campaign of communist Henry Wallace in 1948.  It was definitely a communist front group.</p>
<p>Many gays were happy to join the Mattachine Society.  When they realized it was a communist front the non communist gays managed to take over the organization and force the communists out.</p>
<p>Lauren is right.  I could care less about the issues of gay marriage and abortion.  The courts will decide anyway. </p>
<p>On the whole, I think gay marriage is all right.  It really will solve a lot of problems for all these gays already in what is known as common law marriage for heterosexuals.  Many lesbians are in life long common law marriages anyway and they need the protections of legal marriage for issues as mundane as consenting to medical procedures.</p>
<p>But it is true that the gay community has joined the blacks, hispanics, asians, neocons, communists and liberals from the very beginning.  Even though almost all the gay bashing and beatdowns are committed by blacks and hispanics, the gay community still allies itself against Whites.</p>
<p>White women as well as White gays are an important part of the anti White movement as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not attacking homosexuals, here, but attacking the pointless and counterproductive practice of antagonizing and tormenting them. Do we want them with us or against us? If you count bisexuals, that&rsquo;s a big percentage of the populace that&rsquo;s been alienated from conservatism by threats and insults&#8221;</p>
<p>The gays attacked us first when they joined the blacks, hispanics and marxists.</p>
<p>I am somewhat in favor of gay marriage as a matter of convenience.  I certainly don&rsquo;t oppose it as there are more important issues such as affirmative action, black on white crime and the preaching of White extermination in every college and university.</p>
<p>I was chatting to a gay man.  He brought up the subject of gay marriage.  I said I suppose it would solve a lot of problems for some gays.  He attacked me, screeching, &#8220;solve problems&#8221;? it&rsquo;s a matter of civil rights and the US constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what I mean about gays.  I am not against gay marriage, I am for it. But I am only mildly for it and not at all interested in gay issues.  But the gay guy attacked me because I do not think that the &#8220;right&#8221; of gay marriage is buried in the constitution somewhere.</p>
<p>Remember Lauren, the gays attacked us heterosexual Whites first. They are a big part of the anti White coalition.<br>

		<p>Segregated academic pep rallies are apparently vogue in California.  Schools in Concord and Pasadena have had the same sorts of disturbance.  Schools are such slaves to fashion, I&rsquo;m sure that principals read some notion in their professional journals and adopt it without thinking.</p>
