			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errol Louis, New York Daily News, April 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton will score a big personal and political coup tomorrow when Vice President Biden makes a visit to the Sheraton New York hotel in midtown to address the annual meeting of the National Action Network, Sharpton&rsquo;s organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to Biden, whose schedule was confirmed by a White House press official, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan also are speaking at Sharpton&rsquo;s conference. The ability to draw three cabinet heavyweights  &mdash;  especially the vice president  &mdash;  stamps Sharpton as a civil rights leader with high-level access to President Obama&rsquo;s inner circle.</p>
<p>It also explodes the storyline, popular in the mainstream media, that Sharpton and other black civil-rights activists have been eclipsed or rendered irrelevant by young political dynamos like Obama, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And promoters of the &#8220;new generation&#8221; myth usually overlook the ages of the various players. While Sharpton comes across as much older than Obama  &mdash;  perhaps because the reverend has been a public figure for decades  &mdash;  the two men are actually close in age (Obama 47, Sharpton 54).</p>
<p>More important than age is the reality of different political traditions and different public styles. Sharpton, who has never been slow to jump onto a picket line or controversy, cut his eyeteeth as a 16-year-old aide to Jesse Jackson, while Obama steered a cautious path through the rough-and-tumble of Chicago machine politics.</p>
<p>The result is two men with fundamentally different instincts who became friends during the long presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Older civil rights veterans like Jackson and ex-Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young dismissed the future President with crude attacks, like Young&rsquo;s ribald remarks about Bill Clinton dating more black women than Obama and Jackson&rsquo;s comment, caught on videotape, that he&rsquo;d like to castrate the candidate.</p>
<p>Sharpton, by contrast, talked to Obama and his top aides about strategy and tactics on an almost daily basis following Obama&rsquo;s victory in the Iowa caucuses. Sharpton  &mdash;  well aware of his ability to polarize voters  &mdash;  also often deliberately remained outside the campaign limelight to avoid saddling Obama with extra baggage.</p>
<p>This week proves that Sharpton&rsquo;s help has been duly noted and appreciated by Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And presiding over the session, with no small trace of glee, will be a New Yorker flexing his new muscle as a national powerbroker with A-list access to the Oval Office: Al Sharpton.<br>

			<p>I suppose that being best buddies with the new regime helps when you&rsquo;re 1.3 million behind with the taxman.  If our government is ever put on trial, it won&rsquo;t be hard to convict them, every day brings new outrages.  More time would be spent reading the charges than arguing them.  </p>

			<p>So two white-hating black supremacists - Al Sharpton and Jeremiah Wright - are trusted confidants of the Big Empty Suit. </p>
<p>One lays claim to Tawanda Brawley, the other to &#8220;God D  &mdash;  n America.&#8221; </p>
<p>To top it all off we have Eric &#8220;You&rsquo;re all cowards&#8221; Holder as Attorney General. </p>
<p>Wonderful. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Politics Needs&#8221; a slimebag deadbeat like Al Sharpton who never pays his taxes or rent?</p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t guessed, this reporter is a longtime Sharpton groupie and flunkie.</p>
<p>The only good news regarding this fawning puff piece are the readers&rsquo; comments. Even the ultraliberal democrats in New York have finally wised up to this sleaze.  </p>

			<p>Given the fact that Sharpton, Jackson, Farrakhan and other black leaders unified under the umbrella of the Millions More Movement  the day is coming when Louie Farrakhan will spend an evening in the Lincoln Bedroom - if this hasn&rsquo;t already occurred. Big Al is a shoe-in for brunch with Michelle, the kids and their Black Nationalist President. I just puked all over my shoes&hellip; <br>
Perhaps Holder is correct: When it comes to race we are indeed a nation of White cowards. <br>
Oh, Malik Zulu Shabazz is the number-two guy in the MMM - Malcolm X&rsquo;s son. And since Obama models himself after Malcolm X (Dreams from My Father)  it won&rsquo;t be long before Malik is invited to vacation at the White House, too.<br>

<p>&gt; And  now we may definately add our Commander and Chief to the list of racist bigots in the highest offices.  However he tried to excuse or correct the impression, there can be little doubt of his real feelings after yesterday&rsquo;s news wherein he greeted the president of Brazil with the ghetto bar-room salutation; &#8220;He&rsquo;s my man!&#8221;  This just a week after Lula da Silva blamed the world&rsquo;s troubles on Blue Eyed White Men - a ridiculous statement given the number of brown eyed people we see at the top of the heap - and non-Whites as well.  </p>
<p>But Blue Eyed Whites like Bill Gates may well be blamed for his practices that have sucked the wealth out of White America and passed it out to non-Whites and even to Africans in personalized aid programs.  It is White liberals that can be blamed for this..  However, the ultimate blame is on Blacks and other non-Whites who have slowly chipped away at the integrity of White society.  The permissive culture that they have always championed found its way into business and Whites who are simply clever enough to be the &#8220;Gangstas of Wall Street.&#8221;  We have allowed pop culture to negrify our culture to a point that Blue Eyed Whites were corrupted.  The political and economic world of Latin America was sure to eventually teach a more liberal minded and impressionable White executive class that replaced the staunch, conservative and stubbornly ethical bankers and corporate executives of the past.  I predicted this change in the 1970s!  So sorry to be right!</p>
<p>And if any should remind us that it was a White man who took us off the Gold Standard, I want to remind them that Nixon had brown eyes!</p>

			<p>Here is a youtube video of sharpton telling black people to follow Louis Farrakhan and talking about white people living in the caves. </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/cszfrt" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cszfrt</a></p>
<p>We need to watch Sharpton, Farrakhan, Jackson and Obama among other black leaders for the next four years.</p>

			<p>&#8221; &hellip;a national powerbroker with A-list access&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was compelled to watch the &#8220;news&#8221; yesterday evening and the top story was of course the Obama visit to Strassbourg.<br>
Did they talk about the planning of a New Global Currency?<br>
NO.<br>
Did they talk about anything discussed by the assembled henchmen?<br>
NO.<br>
Did they mention anything even remotely resembling any reluctance or scepticism on the part of the American or other peoples?<br>
NO.<br>
What did they talk about then?<br>
Well, to the best of my understanding, the entirety of the 7 minutes (split over commercial breaks to multiply effect) was devoted entirely to blathering about the glamour and elan of Michelle Obama-especially in contradistinction to Mr. Sarkozys wife.<br>
And there I saw it.<br>
I saw it again when I read the A-List bit.<br>
We now live at the intersection of Glamour and Politics.<br>
And THAT, I believe will be the new face and character of politics for the future.<br>
Please keep an eye on this emerging phenomenon.<br>
It is not too subtle to be overlooked.</p>
<p>As a postscript, as I was walking to my morning resturaunt for breakfast, I shot a glance at the newspaper rack, and saw USA Today had as a leading story telling us of the $1,500,000,000  Yankee Stadium in New York. The bi-line beneath told of $2,500 seats for those who wear the purple (as a roman citizen would have said)<br>
I sat down at my customary table and wondered if those in the skyboxes have caviar on their hotdogs? and what wine &#8216;pairs&rsquo; best with kielbasa?<br>
Yes indeed. <br>
Where HAVE you gone, Joe DiMaggio?<br>
The thought of it all essentially ruined my usually pleasant saturday morning breakfast.<br>
