<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/us/politics/09immig.html?_r=2&amp;hp">Obama to Push Immigration Bill As One Priority</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, April 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While acknowledging that the recession makes the political battle more difficult, President Obama plans to begin addressing the country&rsquo;s immigration system this year, including looking for a path for illegal immigrants to become legal, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some White House officials said that immigration would not take precedence over the health care and energy proposals that Mr. Obama has identified as priorities. But the timetable is consistent with pledges Mr. Obama made to Hispanic groups in last year&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>He said then that comprehensive immigration legislation, including a plan to make legal status possible for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, would be a priority in his first year in office. Latino voters turned out strongly for Mr. Obama in the election.</p>

			<p>I read about this this morning on the MSN page and it infuriated me.  The question is, at what point to we stop whining behind our computer screens and actually get up and start doing something?  And if you are one of the standard doomsdayers on here who thinks there is no way out of this, please spare the rest of us your pessimism.  Don&rsquo;t drag the rest of us down with you. Quite frankly, if you are one of the people on here who constantly speaks of how the destruction of our race is unavoidable, you are not fit to be posting on here.  You are just as bad as the liberal multiculturalists.  What is your problem and what are you trying to accomplish?</p>

			<p>Amazement of all amazements, Rush Limbaugh finally admitted today that &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; is a bipartisan things because (almost exact words) &#8220;both parties want open borders for one reason or another.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not often that he unloads at the Republican Party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad President Obama is so arrogant as to push this in public.   This might wake enough people up, though it was in this same time frame two years ago when they tried.  They&rsquo;re trying to time it as far away from elections as possible.</p>

			<p>Has anyone else but me noticed the estimate of illegal immigrants never changes? </p>
<p>The figure of 12 million has not been adjusted in years.</p>
<p>My hunch is the figure is at least double.</p>

			<p>I thought Obama ran on &#8220;change.&#8221; Big deal! If he wanted change, he&rsquo;d get on TV and demand that illegal aliens go home. What is so difficult about that? They&rsquo;ll find their way just as they found our borders to breach. He said, in a campaign speech, &#8220;we&rsquo;re Americans, we can do anything.&#8221; No, sir, we can&rsquo;t.<br/>
We can&rsquo;t get rid of 25 million illegals, we can&rsquo;t stop the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; fiasco, we can&rsquo;t stop benefits, we can&rsquo;t stop educating and medicating people who do not even belong here. We can&rsquo;t say &#8220;no mas&#8221; to the leaders of the corrupt countries who wrge their people to break our laws. We can&rsquo;t stop hiring them, giving them mortgages, welfare, food stamps, college educations and then handing the bill to loyal, patriotic LEGAL Americans! So, what does that make our country, Mr. President. I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip; a CAN&rsquo;T DO NATION. You&rsquo;ve got a chance to fix it. Will you, or will you follow the last few administration and finish us as a country?</p>

			<p>Obama is an open borders big spending socialist.  If he gets 8 years in office he will add as much to the national debt as the previous 232 years of United States federal deficits.  By making citizens out of 20 million illegal aliens (there are far more than 12 million by now) he will further bankrupt the government by doubling the welfare rolls.  (Those &#8220;hard working&#8221; Hispanics will be a lot less hard working when they can qualify for AFDC, food stamps, section 8 housing vouchers, and Medicaid, all without having to use fake ID.)</p>

			<p>There are 4 million illegals in greater Los Angeles alone.</p>
<p>There are over 25 million illegal aliens. This does not <br/>
count those on legal visas that have refused to go home.<br/>
We cant even be honest about simple numbers anymore.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s probably between 30-40 million illegals, plus 15-20 million anchor babies.</p>
<p>Does anyone notice how granting amnesty to illegals is called &#8220;immigration reform&#8221;?  I was always taught that reform was defined as &#8220;making better&#8221; or reigning in the excess&rsquo;s.  A true Immigration Reform would be to mass-deport illegals and drastically curtail legal immigration.</p>

			<p>Courtney, let me say something to you in all sincerity (despite my nom de plume).</p>
<p>Some of us have moved on past denial and anger.  There is no bargaining that will stop the demographic forces changing this country, and I&rsquo;m tired of being depressed about it.</p>
<p>The last stage of grief is acceptance.  Not the acceptance of the demise of the European peoples, but the acceptance that the America I grew up in, the one that three generations of my family fought for with their blood, is gone into the pages of history.</p>
<p>It is time to move on and look for a new future for my family, my people and my culture.  There are a lot of possibilities, and that is where my efforts are directed. I miss the America of my childhood, but I miss my father, too.  And neither one is coming back.</p>

			<p>Americans have this romantic vision of becoming a US citizen. What Obama and the rest of the marxist are really talking about is DUAL citizenship. In other words &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; gain US citizenship while retaining all of the voting rights of their native countries. They can then play both sides against each other for their own benefit. Either the MSM is ignorant of this or they are totally in favor. There is no third way. Giving away the Keys To The Kingdom in this fashion proves the marxists and the government-media complex are one in the same. They are NOT our friends and should be considered enemies.</p>

			<p>I hate the prospect, but this will awaken the sleeping giant that is white America.  It is amazingly stupid and egotisital of Obama that he did this as he is trying to get America to pass his socialistic agenda forward.  Finally, he has committed political suicide I think.  </p>

			<p>The time for talk is over.They will not listening. I am attending a tea party on April 15th. These demonstrations are the beginning of the end of the elitist makeover for america. If they continue down this path, I believe a full scale revolt will transpire. Our Founders paid for this piece of earth we call home in blood and treasure.We who are alive today are the stewards of their revoloutionary spirit.How dare the elites ram 40 million illegal aliens down our throats, making us a permanant minority in our own nation, and against our will.     &#8220;Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.&#8221; Jefferson</p>

			<p>If El Presidente is to make good on his &#8220;pledge&#8221; to the Hispanics&hellip; we need to make good on one of our own. To unseat Obama in 2012 and to bar the Democrats from ever again regaining control of Congress. Mission Impossible? Hardly. We White Americans still outnumber the lying cheating Hispanics and we can outvote them.</p>
<p>We just need to get politically active. To get involved. If Obama and his Tax-o-crats betray America, rest assured. The day of reckoning and payback time will happen. Starting as early as the 2010 mid-term elections.</p>
<p>November 2010 can become an instant replay of Election Day, 2006. When the Democrats won control simply because so many Americans have had it with G.W.B.&rsquo;s bumbling fumbling wars and failed domestic and international policies. Let&rsquo;s make it happen next year. Make your friends know how you feel and WHY.</p>

			<p>The numbers are likely 20 million.  However, once legalized they gain the ability legally to bring in family members.  So, if on average 2 family members per amnestied illegal were brought in, we are looking at 60 million more uneducated, unskilled, unassimilable government dependents.</p>

			<p>Obama is an anti-American globalist on steroids and will do everything in his power to bring us to our knees!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bankrupting our nation and dismantling our sovereignty&hellip;  Working quickly and furiously to bring us down to the same level as the rest of the &#8220;global community,&#8221;  we can no longer consider ourselves as &#8220;special&#8221; or extraordinary&hellip;  No.  Quite the contrary, we must crawl on bended knee and seek forgiveness for our past &#8220;arrogance&#8221; from the rest of the world, and we must learn to show more respect for the Muslim World to boot.</p>
<p>As for wide open borders and the ongoing Mexican invasion&hellip;  Janet Napolitano has effectively killed most forms of interior enforcement:  E-Verify - not good enough to attach to the $787 &#8220;economic stimulus&#8221; package; 287G - seems to propose certain &#8220;problems&#8221; so must be &#8220;reconsidered&#8221;; the fence - not necessary with a &#8220;virtual&#8221; fence; worksite raids - according to Ms. Nancy Pelosi - these raids are downright un-American; and of course, the ongoing &#8220;investigation&#8221; of Sheriff Joe for &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;&hellip;   </p>
<p>Of course, Obama will not sign any type of Amnesty Bill; but just the fact that this &#8220;debate&#8221; is once again brought up to the surface, will encourage even more illegal aliens to invade and the ones that are already here to stay&hellip;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Hope&#8221; and &#8220;Change&#8221; we can believe in!</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no way this push to legalize all these failures from south of the border is going to do anything, but bring great harm to this economy.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re here anyway, but as the following months will unequivocally reveal, the economy will collapse to the point where unemployment is going to be considerably higher than it is right now, which, in actuality, is about 15-16%, if part-timers looking for full-time are counted and those who have given up looking for work.</p>
<p>What does this mean in raw figures?  It means that a society cannot exist with an unemployment rate above 25%(with a heavier hit on the freebies programs) which is what the figure will be after legalization&hellip;..or higher.  </p>
<p>So, with an additional burden of millions on unemployment, all drawing social benefits, collapse will undoubtedly be emminent at any point after legalizing these people.</p>
<p>However, with or without them, we&rsquo;re heading for a train wreck big time.  With them, we&rsquo;ll just get there a little faster.</p>

			<p>Just in the last couple of months I&rsquo;ve noticed the talk show hosts, especially Limbaugh and Boortz, complain about race or people of color, with both declaring that certain situations involved hatred against whites.</p>
<p>Today, Boortz declared that the Black Caucus was so enamored of Castro, because he was a &#8220;person of color,&#8221; and if a white person were in charge of a country with the same track record Castro has he would be condemned by these same people vigorously.  (Since Fidel is white, I&rsquo;m assuming Boortz was referring to the fact that blacks think of him as a person of color, which they do.  They are desperate to include everyone they can in that category to get them under the same umbrella, which is quite humorous really, because blacks and Hispanics hate each other, generally.  Blacks also like to think of Spaniards, Greeks, etc, as non-white so as to minimize the white threat in their own minds and to feel as if they have more soldiers against the hated white enemy.)</p>
<p>A movement is now forming among whites in degrees.  The Tea Party demonstrations are growing and will protest high taxes and growing government control all across the US, April 15, and will be covered by Fox News&hellip;.I believe for most of the day.</p>
<p>A group of oat takers in the miitary and police are uniting into a growing unified movement.</p>
<p>All this is quite a phenomenen.  For those of you who are always beating your chests for action NOW! this could be the beginning of a third political party made up for the advancement of white interests.  After observing the below link, share your views on that and illegals becoming legal. Does it look as if there is a growing white political movement?</p>

			<p>I guess I better double down on my contributions to NumbersUSA and start calling my liberal wacko senators. I don&rsquo;t want to be caught flat footed like the last time.</p>
<p>Everyone determined to see the Obama Amnesty defeated should think about sitting down once a week to write a letter to his/her senator and congressman using specific examples of how Mexican immigration is damaging their community: tagging of freeway signs, waits of increasing length at the emergency room, threats to your kids safety and education at a local public school, incidents of vandalism and home break-ins on your block (usually coinciding with someone having their roof fixed   &mdash;   a perfect place to be a lookout while your amigo is knocking over a nearby house), or perhaps how much your tax bill went up last year to cover the ballooning cost of social services for impoverished Mexican settlers. Give plenty of details   &mdash;   use stuff right out of the last weeks crime log. Otherwise, elected officials just shrug off your letters as racist rants.</p>
<p>Really, for the life of me I don&rsquo;t understand why our federal government, with its overpopulated urban areas, its exponentially escalating, hyper-violent Hispanic drug crime in 230 cities, and its high unemployment, doesn&rsquo;t radically adjust downward its immigration quotas. And close our southern border. Immigration is certainly not benefiting the majority of US citizens as it drives them into tax slave minority status! Immigration restriction is the clear will of the people. And this is a democracy, no? So why don&rsquo;t our democratically elected representatives just cut it?</p>
<p>I have an idea. Next time your elected representative has a town hall meeting, ask him if you can buy his no vote on the Obama Amnesty. Say you are willing to cash in your 401K account and match or exceed LaRaza&rsquo;s contribution to his reelection campaign account. Moreover you&rsquo;re willing to put in 40 - 80 hours in a get out the vote effort next election to see he stays in his comfortable job. See what he says.</p>

			<p>Dear Courtney,</p>
<p>I often use criticisms and dire predictions - as they are well founded problems that need to be solved.  This does not necessarily consider the racial breakdown that others posting here and I often calculate.  I also often make criticisms of ideas that serve to suggest that Whites have the option of somehow &#8220;returning&#8221; to the &#8220;good old days.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I do that my agument has been that in order to survive, Whites must find new ways of thinking, believing and operating.  Since this means that Whites - and American Whites are extremely individualistic and isolated - a very unhelpful situation when one sizes up all the &#8220;minority&#8221; organizations and women&rsquo;s organizations, etc., that are stacked up against them - must divorce their minds from old knee-jerk reactionary thinking. Whites will have to learn to socially cooperate in larger forums than a Grange hall or a church.  Whites who wish to see their race survive must think beyond their own back yard.  &#8220;Social&#8221; must become a safe word because it is going to require a kind of socialism among Whites for any real effect to be realized.  I believe that we must become national socialists who are not Nazis - quite a trick.  And the media and government works against the least suggestion of White unity as if it must herald the rise of a new hate group or revival of a dead or near dead one.  So it is a huge problem.</p>
<p>However, it can be done.  Just take a look at the group known as The Jehova Witnesses.  If you take away the religious tennets, you have a group that is actually a sort of Socialist order.  The same goes for Mormons - especially in the past - if not so much in the present.  But it is the tennets of belief that seperates everyone.  I think that is incredibly remarkable and it shows no signs of relenting.  That makes me pessimistic about White survival.  This is because a return to the &#8220;good old days&#8221; with such baggage would most likely entail an eventual return to the really bad old days of the Inquisition, religious wars, and the attending social harm and suffering that came with it.  Think of how fast Europe would have developed and dominated the world without all that!  Leonardo Da Vinci may have succeeded in flight and even parachutes and helicopters.  European scientists would not have to have snuck around to avoid persecution by fanatical religious leaders.  So I argue for a White future where we actually benefit from our self-alleged high IQ and not on superstitious dogmas.  I argue that it is only right that any White religion - if it is really needed - ought to focus on Whites not Middle Eastern myth and concocted beliefs.  In my view, ancestor worship as many pre-Christian European religions practiced is congruent with White survival while Christianity, like Islam or Judaism is for Middle Eastern peoples.  The fault of pre-Christian Europeans, including Romans was their open mindedness regarding religious ideas.  But we cannot afford to repeat the history of how religion always politicizes itself and seeks to dominate for its own sake. </p>
<p>In the discussion of this on the Amren posting board, not everyone is going to agree and some poster&rsquo;s just think they own the board, or asssume that their view is the one that prevails or ought to prevail.  I am offering ideas that are unusual.  They don&rsquo;t have to be exactly what I say, but I sincerely believe that this or something much like it is the way to White survival.  This is the kind of fascism that got Whites into the fix they are in.  In this light, EVERYONE is FIT to post.   Anyone can criticize, but if they do, they ought to offer at least a general solution as an alternative to despair.</p>
<p>So I try to do that.  Some regular posters here probably don&rsquo;t care for my posts and I likely think they are on the wrong track and stuck in the past or in their narrow little views that few will end up sharing.  </p>
<p>In the event that society actually breaks down - which is possible - it is prudent to have some idea of likely models for the re-assembling of a White society.  I just happen to believe that the options of slavery, exploiting land, exploiting other national groups, nations, etc., will not be an option for Whites in any likely future.  That epic is over.  This means that we must find the means within ourselves to survive and even proliferate with any hope of a future.  I suggest that old models apply to a completely different and conditions unlikely to reappear.  Even if those conditions did reappear, I find it unlikely that any intelligent White would really want to engage in activities that are sure to fail in time.  Or are we just creatures with only enough sense to chase our tails?</p>
<p><br/>
Posters here often go on about how they are the real Americans.  But what does it mean to be a real American?  The U.S. was founded on the idea of freedom of speech, choice and conscience, along with the rights that all here care about like the Right to Bear Arms and defend one&rsquo;s self.  So even among White&rsquo;s some tolerance is required.  I worry that the practice of intolerance of non-Whites, immigrants, blacks, etc., even if it is justified, that is, gone beyond the requirement of normal tolerance - intolerable, creates a habit of intolerance on the most petty levels that will defeat ANY White survival.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question; &#8220;What are you trying to accomplish?&#8221; I reply with this; Discuss the likely solutions, which must include identifying likely pitfalls.  It is a philosophical discussion that must take place and I wish there was a better forum, but Amren provides the best one I know of (thank you, Amren).  In my view, the few Whites who seem to care about the survival of the White race, have an awful lot of reflecting to do before they can hope to really have any effect on the momentum of events in the West.  That is because intention must be clear before success can be realized.</p>

			<p>So, with an additional burden of millions on unemployment, all drawing social benefits, collapse will undoubtedly be emminent at any point after legalizing these people.</p>
<p>However, with or without them, we&rsquo;re heading for a train wreck big time. With them, we&rsquo;ll just get there a little faster.</p>

Without them we&rsquo;d be a predominantly White country. A great country. A first class country. Think about that for a minute.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It is time to move on and look for a new future for my family, my people and my culture. There are a lot of possibilities, and that is where my efforts are directed. I miss the America of my childhood, but I miss my father, too. And neither one is coming back.&#8221;  Posted by We&rsquo;re Screwed at 12:36 AM on April 10 </p>
<p>Yes, I agree.  If putting forth a point of view based on an accurate analysis, backed up by huge numbers of experts, seems to someone as it is dragging them down, I might just say that hiding one&rsquo;s head in the sand certainly isn&rsquo;t the thing to do, nor is denying the facts apt to be beneficial to anyone.  </p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to pick and choose one&rsquo;s beliefs based on what makes him feel good and know what the future has in store for us.   One does the analysis and goes where the facts take him, as he interprets them.  Confronting bad news is always  necessary in order to prepare for it.  We ARE all adults aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>However, if anybody thinks whites are finished as a people, I definitely don&rsquo;t agree with that, because we&rsquo;re more likely than not to come out of this better off than before, even if the country implodes. <br/>

			<p>&#8220;  &mdash;  -It really is such a shame that Black supremacists do not see that their vital interests are being severly hurt by aiding and abetting the Mestizo invasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Whitey or not, the Mestizo&rsquo;s absolutely hate your guts, and have no qualms in showing and/or acting on it. Be assured of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this country &mdash; and this world, thanks to Globalism (Globaloney) &mdash; of scarcer and scarcer resources, they will be your direct competitors in Post-European America.  &mdash;  -&#8220;</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>Fantastic points!!!</p>
<p>And being &#8216;minorities&rsquo; themselves they are JUST AS ENTITLED to AA as Blacks are.</p>
<p>With the Mestizo&rsquo;s numbers growing by leaps and bounds thanks to (h)immigration, even without their disdain and contempt, there will just be that many more of THEM to compete with!</p>
<p>So much for your puppet &#8216;leader&rsquo; (N)Obama &#8220;looking out&rsquo; for &#8216;you&#8221;.</p>

			<p>  Once these illegal mestizos are legalized, the cheap labor people won&rsquo;t want them no more. So they will hire new batches of illegals. The cycle will never end.</p>
