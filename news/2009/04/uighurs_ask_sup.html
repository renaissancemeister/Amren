<h1><a href="https://wtop.com/?nid=343&amp;sid=1643100">Uighurs Ask Supreme Court for Their Freedom</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chinese Muslim detainees at Guantanamo Bay asked the Supreme Court on Monday to order their release into the United States.</p>
<p>In court papers, a group of Uighurs (proponounced WEE&rsquo;-gurz) says the high court should overrule a federal appeals panel in Washington, which has blocked the release of the Uighurs.</p>
<p>A federal judge determined in October that the Uighurs should be freed because the Pentagon no longer considered them enemy combatants. U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina said they should be allowed into this country because the administration could find no other country willing to accept them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The US government has acknowledged that these 17 men are wrongly imprisoned at Guantanamo and have nowhere safe to go,&#8221; said Emi MacLean, staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. &#8220;If President Obama is truly committed to closing Guantanamo, these men should be on a plane to restart their lives in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said Urbina had gone too far in ordering the men released into the United States.</p>
<p>The three-judge appeals panel suggested the detainees might be able to seek entry by applying to the Homeland Security Department, which administers U.S. immigration laws. But the court bluntly concluded that the detainees otherwise had no constitutional right to immediate freedom after being held in custody at Guantanamo without charges for nearly seven years.</p>

			<p>I did not know China had much of a Muslim population.  Mainly because the Chinese government is many things, and many bad things, but they won&rsquo;t tolerate one second of the Johnny Jihad nonsense that pandering white Western governments would.  Watching the Chinese vs AQ/OBL style radical Islam is going to be like a 30-round grudge match between a Grizzley Bear and a Siberian Tiger.</p>

			<p>They should simply be returned to the country where they were captured, in this case almost certainly Afghanistan, WHETHER OR NOT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS THEM.</p>
<p>A military airlift flight would make this very simple: Put them on a C-141 or C-17 from Guantanamo to Kabul, via, say, Ascension Island and Diego Garcia.  With no-landings in non-US-controlled territory, I anticipate no nation would know who was on the plane, let alone be in any position to complain about the matter.</p>

			<p>Technically, the Uighurs are not racially Asian but rather white.<br>
Google it.  The Chinese tried to claim the White looking mummified beings as Asian but the DNA testing showed that they were more closely aligned with Europeans.  The Uranita Book is the only source to find the origin of these people.  Originally, they had more Adam and Eve blood in them.  Adam/Eve had yellow, brown,and red hair and blue eyes and fair skin.  The Uighurs by external breeding, now appear less European.  Most of Adam and Eve descendents migrated to Europe by way of Russia and to Greece.  The orignial Greeks are gone by breeding with inferior genes.  The present white race is a mixture primarily of the blue race and Adam and Eve descendents which explains the inventions, etc. primarily coming from the white race.  Race and gentics are closely linked. One cannot occur without the other.    </p>

			<p>Obama just asked almost everybody during his visit in Europe to tak the Uighurs and others in (besides also urging EU to admit Turkey&hellip;). <br>
But most countries flatly refused. Which I consider correct.</p>

			<p>I wonder what these Uighurs had to do in Afghanistan where they were made prisoners. Their home country is western China, about 3000 miles to the northeast of Afghanistan, and there is no connection -no road, no railway, no direct airline- between the two. That means that they must have planned their voyage quite carefully and that they spent quite some money to get into a country which does not have any attraction for ordinary people. Who organized that and who payed for it?</p>

			<p>Other Uighurs-under-a-cloud ended up in hospitable-but-poor Albania a couple of years ago. At least two of these seem to have moved on to sapheaded and ever-welcoming Sweden.</p>
<p>Muslim-majority Indonesia is immense and well able to accommodate these people on islands like Buru, which was the dumping ground for high-status political prisoners after the Army counter-coup which overthrew Achmed Soekarno.</p>
<p>Actually, they are NO threat to the U.S.A., look on them as armed Tibetans who happen to be East Turkestani and caught up in a civil war which was none of their business.</p>

<p><br>
The above statement is not entirely true. China has called for the release of these men into their custody. America has refused. You can defy the Chinese on principle, but be prepared to accept the consequences of your actions. You can take the Uighurs in, but my gawd don&rsquo;t complain about it.</p>

			<p>Again America is supposed to be the dumping ground of last resort for people not wanted anywhere else. That&rsquo;s because the world knows us as sap-heads. With no useful education and dumped into the most prosperous country in the world one can imagine crime will be a too big a temptation for the world&rsquo;s unwanted. This has been proven often enough.</p>

			<p>Uighurs are a Turkic people living in what was once &#8220;east Turkestan&#8221; and is now the Chinese &#8220;autonomous&#8221; province of Xinjiang. Ancient white mummies (apparently with tartan patterned tunics) found in this area are likely remains of the indo-european people that inhabited much of central Asia prior to the mongol invasions, when they were slaughtered like cattle and completely wiped out. One way or another, Xinjiang has been subjected to the same tactic of &#8220;ethnic inundation&#8221; as Tibet. When you have 1.1 billion people of the same ethnic group, its easy to move tens of millions of them around to make the demographics more to the liking of The Party. </p>

			<p>Anonymous above is correct.  One of my parents&rsquo; neighbors is Uighur and when he first moved in my Dad thought he was Turkish or Middle Eastern.  Once you get into Central Asia and the &#8216;stans, you get more of a mix of Mongoloid and Caucasian, with appearances varying from one extreme to the other.  And about those mummies in Xinjiang, I saw a special on TV where they said they were from a well-travelled Indo-European group of people.  The Indo-Europeans were probably the first to domesticate horses, so its no surprise they left evidence of their presence in such remote places.</p>
