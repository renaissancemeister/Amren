<h1>Lacrosse Accuser to Speak</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel Coleman, Daily Tar Heel (University of North Carolina), April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman involved in the Duke University lacrosse team scandal more than three years ago will make a rare public appearance today at UNC as part of an event about social injustice.</p>
<p>Crystal Gail Mangum, who accused three Duke lacrosse players of rape in 2006, will speak in the Sonja Haynes Stone Center about &#8220;the harsh realities of minority treatment both in the justice system and the media,&#8221; according to the event&rsquo;s press release.</p>
<p>The lacrosse players were later declared innocent by Attorney General Roy Cooper, who said Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong rushed to accuse based on false information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The event series, called &#8220;Cracks in the Justice System: Victims of Money, Media, and Misconduct,&#8221; is led by Theta Nu Xi Inc. sorority and Alpha Phi Alpha Inc. and Lambda Upsilon Lambda Inc. fraternities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an issue that everyone knows about, but we have never heard her voice,&#8221; said Daniele Dickerson, a sophomore and member of Theta Nu Xi.</p>
<p>The speech will focus on legal and publicity issues within the case, but Mangum will not speak about her involvement with the Duke lacrosse team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s hosts said they are not trying to declare guilt or innocence by holding the event, but simply want to allow Mangum a chance to share her experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this will be well-received by the University and maybe open people&rsquo;s minds concerning the justice system,&#8221; said Derrika Wright, a junior who helped plan the event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Organizers are ensuring that security will be present at the event in light of last week&rsquo;s protests that prevented former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo from speaking.</p>

			<p>On the one hand, they say that Miss Magnum&rsquo;s &#8220;speech&#8221; and their inviting her to &#8220;speak&#8221; should not be construed to mean that the sororities and UNC have taken sides on the issue.  Yet people are going to walk away with the implication that they have, that they&rsquo;re taking her side in spite of the proven truth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all a Duke-UNC rivalry thing.</p>

			<p>Did anybody but me wonder why the conservative talk show hosts never revealed black on white rape statistics (which are about 37,000 per year)at the time Jesse and Al were shrieking hysterically about white men raping a black woman?  </p>
<p>In fact, why wasn&rsquo;t ANYBODY talking about it?  It would have been just the ticket needed to shut the mouths of the black talking heads on television and the print media.</p>
<p>Have we become so spineless we&rsquo;re afraid to point out abuses and violence against us?</p>
<p>There will be many who will resent this false accuser being treated as a privleged guest at a left wing academia mind-conditioning factory, but if whites had stood up and loudly complained about the atrocious injustice of black on white rapes, she wouldn&rsquo;t dare show her face anywhere.</p>
<p>Do we really even deserve justice, since we won&rsquo;t even stand up to protect our women?</p>

			<p>Unbelievable.  She got nothing but special treatment.</p>
<p>She should have been prosecuted, yet because she was black she was allowed to lie with impunity.  Nifong never question her about her inconsistencies because he didn&rsquo;t want to offend her or other blacks.  Nifong even put a line-up in front of her that consisted only of Duke, white male students that were known to have attended the party, just to make sure she didn&rsquo;t do anything embarrassing like pick out the Nifong&rsquo;s brother or the chief of police.</p>
<p><br>
The media protected her identity so nobody could look at her past lies.  The same media mercilessly paraded the accused in front of the cameras and traded every tidbit gossip they could find, even though they are supposed to be presumed innocent.  Feminist made every attempt to cover her inconsistencies with &#8220;well she was traumatized, so she can&rsquo;t be held to a consistent story.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was at least some justice when the media and other activists after months of spotlighting the case had to eventually acknowledge it was a hoax</p>

			<p>How ironic is it that they get Crystal Gail Mangum to speak about the harsh realities of the justice system on minorities when she was given a free pass for her criminal behavior in the Duke case due to her race? One of the lacrosse players would have been far more appropriate in a discussion about injustice. </p>

			<p>A stripper and liar who belongs in prison is expected to somehow have something meaningful to say about &#8220;social injustice&#8221;?  Why weren&rsquo;t the falsely accused lacross players invited to share their story?  This is an embarassment.  This is such an obvious waste of time and money that the university should refuse to host this event. </p>

			<p>Why should this lying wanna-be scam artist get a chance to &#8220;tell her side of the story&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t nearly ruining the lives of several innocent young men enough? Is she going to apologize to them personally? I doubt it. It COULD have been true is good enough for shrill, hate-filled black women who want to &#8220;get one over on da man&#8221; and if they &#8220;embroider&#8221; the facts a little (well invent sheer fiction, actually) oh well, no harm done really, not any that really counts, that is&hellip; </p>

			<p>I have to get this off my chest. Obviously these guys were innocent. But keep in mind the following: the accused in this case are the 21-22 year old sons of some of the wealthiest and powerfull men in America. They are the movers and shakers of the economy. Colin Finnerty-Chaminade High grad-is the son of Kenneth Finnerty an investment banker and hedge fund manager who was used his wealth to buy the politicians who loosened financial regulation of the finacial markets and who was actively involved in the creating the subprime fiasco. Millions of White Americans are suffering terribly becauser of this. Finnety&rsquo;s father, like the other members of the Wall Street insiders cabal, are the force behind the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy.</p>
<p>As a proud White Nationalist, I have very little sympathy for these spoiled rich kids. I view the economic class that they belng to as the mortal enemy of ordinary Native Born White Americans. </p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go overboard with the sympathy. They have utter contempt for the rest of US.</p>

			<p>I tend to agree with you, Jupiter&hellip;but the point is, they were falsely accused of something and put through hell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who the person is, it&rsquo;s wrong to falsely accuse anyone like that.</p>
<p>Mangum should be sitting in jail.  I believe that if you falsely accuse someone of a crime  &mdash;  purposefully and maliciously  &mdash;  you should be made to serve the time the innocent person would have served.</p>

			<p>This article, along with the first one on AmRen, has convinced me that we really are living in the Twilight Of Civilization. When you can justify your failures just by saying &#8220;I thought I was going to fail&#8221; and proven liars and crooks are invited to speak about justice at institutions of higher learning, the world has truly gone insane.  </p>

<p>He is right. Without the tacit approval of the White ruling class, speakers expressing pro-White views could not be shut down by radical revolutionary activists. Its little different from the days of the 60s 70s &#8220;revolution&#8221; when that foul degenerate class &#8220;went with the flow&#8221; by throwing ordinary Whites to the wolves in order to save their own hides. </p>

<p>I believe the lacrosse players were intent on getting their jollies by humiliating a black female.  They hired two consenting black strippers who were in business for just that purpose, but their behavior was deplorable regardless. </p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t deserve to get falsely accused of rape, or be prosecuted by a crooked D.A., but I don&rsquo;t regret that the scheme blew up in their faces.  I have a feeling if I knew them personally, I would sympathise with them even less.</p>
<p>Mangum shouldn&rsquo;t even be outside bars right now, let alone be an invited speaker at UNC after abusing the legal system like she has.  Does this sorority understand that criminals like Mangum do harm to the cause of legitimate rape victims, including black female victims?  I guess they don&rsquo;t.  I guess blame whitey is more important.</p>

			<p>I also tend to agree with you, Jupiter&hellip;but one of the larger questions here is can anyone name any other industry that gets away with treating it&rsquo;s best customers- middle and upper class white people- as if they were criminals.

<p>Yeah, NOW they&rsquo;re interested in making sure a controversial speech doesn&rsquo;t get disrupted, when they agree with the message.  Too bad they couldn&rsquo;t have gotten religion on the 1st Amendment a few weeks ago, but all they seem to care for is &#8220;minority good, whitey bad&#8221; (to the tune of &#8220;four legs good, two legs bad&#8221;).</p>

			<p>Jupiter, the fact that they were wealthy was the only reason they got justice. If they were poor &#8220;rednecks&#8221; they would have had a public defender coerce them into taking a plea which would have involved prison time, expulsion from college, and a criminal record which would prevent them from likely ever getting a decent job. They would have been demonized as the epitomy of white evilness for all time, while Crystal made the rounds on talk shows promoting books and made for tv movies about herself. </p>
<p>Also Ms. Magnum would have probably filed a civil suit against them and bankrupted them and their families and squeezed them for whatever little assets they had.</p>

<p>If have ever voted for a Republican President and Republican Senator, you voted for the continuation of post-1965 immigration that will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. The Cenusus Bureau will announce this early 2011.</p>
<p>Colin Finnerty -from the day he entered Chaminade High School- was a Wall Street Tycoon in training. The same can be said of all his Duke Lacrosse team mates. Finnerty and Seligman already have jobs on Wall Street. In the future, they will be money men for future democratic and republican presidential candidates who with very high probability will be either hispanic and asian.The Duke Lacrosse is legendary for being a den of dabauchery.Every weekend is group sex with a mental ill lower class black female. Of course, this is excellent training for  a career on Wall Street. The economic logic of Wall Street requires a low wage economy for the rest of US. The movers and shakers of Wall Street-Colin&rsquo;s father Kevin Finnerty-cover up their extreme greed with the propaganda of the blessings of diversity-then  it is only a hop-and a skip away to the fanatical support of importing post-1965 non-white scab labor.</p>
<p>I understand the importance- to all Native Born White Males- of defending the spoiled adolescent sons of Wall Street tycoons falsely accused of rape by a mentally distuibed black female:if you can get away with going after their sons..the sons of the Native Born White America working class haven&rsquo;t a snowballs chance in hell in this society. But I do it  holding my Irish nose.</p>
<p>In my opinion, prosecutors who knowing frame and put away innocent people should be thought of as sociopaths.</p>

			<p>What is so surprising about this?  That they are allowing a known liar to give a speech, the same known liar who tried to ruin the lives of 3 innocent men.  I think they should have Mike Nifong up there too.  Do you think anybody in the audience will be allowed to hold her accountable for her deplorable and despicable actions.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been invited to speak at a function for social injustice.  What injustices were done to her?  The fact that she was born black and made bad choices in her life - are we supposed to believe that she is an example of social injustice.  How about the 3 men who she accused?  I believe they were the victims of injustice.</p>

<p>He is right. The enabling legislation for the discriminatory so called civil &#8220;rights&#8221; laws of the 60s is the &#8220;open ended&#8221; 14th Amendment. The intent of that legislation and the subsequent legislation that it enabled is to keep the White worker and yeoman classes in their place, and as things are turning out, to destroy them entirely. The 14th Amendment was legislated by the Republicans. </p>

<p>They requested white strippers, not black.  The moment the two strippers showed up at their door was when the lacrosse players knew they were black.  They didn&rsquo;t turn them away out of some warped sense of racial guilt and/or insensitivity.</p>

<p>The prosecutors, judges and lawyers, 95% white are the ones who are doing the real dirty work in killing the normal white working people.</p>
<p>Got some money or property?  <br>
Guess what?</p>
<p>You are it, the target.<br>

<p>They requested a Hispanic stripper and did not care what race the other lady was. </p>
<p>Ysome of you posters need to stop making up lies defendin these boys! While I am glad that there were not incarcerated, the fact remains that they are not racailly conscious White men and they put themsleves in the predicament they found themselves in. </p>

			<p>Somewhat off-topic, but still important, if you are going to have a party or stag and are going to have female &#8220;entertainers&#8221;, make ABSOLUTELY SURE the women are White and not black. Had this woman been White the media would have ignored this story.</p>

			<p>I wonder what the reaction would be if the accused lacrosse players all showed up at the talk and just stared at her the whole time.</p>
