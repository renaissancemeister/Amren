			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Roughneen, Washington Times, April 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Backers of Shariah-compliant finance see an opportunity for expansion amid the global economic downturn, and some Western banks are welcoming this growing source of new business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamic bankers should do some missionary work in the Western world to promote the concept of Shariah banking, for which many in the West are more than ready now,&#8221; Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said at the World Islamic Economic Forum last month in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Such statements have given rise to fears that Shariah finance is a stalking horse for hidden political or religious aims. Shariah finance is an extension of Islamic law, pushing a faith-based alternative to Western banking.</p>
<p>Key Islamists who advise Shariah financial houses have called for full Shariah law to be adopted in Western countries and, in some cases, have made statements supporting terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Shariah finance means institutions and norms that fit with Islamic law. Fully compliant Islamic financial institutions are prohibited from interest payments and require transactions to be backed by tangible assets.</p>
<p>Speculation and hedge funds are off limits  &mdash;  ditto for anything connected to porn, gambling, alcohol or pork. Shariah finance targets Muslims who want to avoid what are deemed &#8220;un-Islamic&#8221; Western banks or financial practices, and appeals to clients&rsquo; faith as well as their bottom line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Depending on the measurements used, the Shariah finance sector manages assets of $700 billion to $800 billion, according to the Islamic Financial Services Board, an industry body. Standard and Poor&rsquo;s estimates that the sector could reach $4 trillion before long.</p>
<p>Shariah banks make up a small fraction of the global banking sector, and they may have suffered less than Western counterparts by being sheltered from the subprime crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christopher Holton, vice president of the Center for Security Policy and director of its Shariah Risk Due Diligence Project, told The Times: &#8220;It is a myth that Islamic finance has provided a hedge against crisis. The FTSE Islamic Index has fallen 41 percent, and the all-world index 44 percent, similar losses over the past six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the varying prohibitions, some Shariah banks find creative ways to make the equivalent of market interest rates by other means, such as by pegging debtor repayment rates to his or her future profits, or when a bank offers a &#8220;hibah,&#8221; or gift to those who open an account  &mdash;  in essence a way of attracting new customers in lieu of interest accruals on savings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The IFSL recently published a detailed report on the sector highlighting how &#8220;the U.K. is getting ahead of the game, in Europe at least, in facilitating this sector&#8221;  &mdash;  as noted by Emile Abu-Shakra, media relations manager at British bank Lloyds TSB.</p>
<p>Lloyds stole a march on the competition by greasing the wheels for Shariah-compliant bank-to-bank transactions, and now Britain has a bigger Shariah finance sector than Egypt or Pakistan.</p>
<p>In total, 22 financial institutions offer Shariah-compliant services in Britain, compared with nine in the United States. However the American financial sector is eager to source and provide new products  &mdash;  among them Shariah finance.</p>
<p>American International Group Inc.&rsquo;s December pledge to bring Islamic home insurance to the United States was met with a written rebuke by Rep. Sue Myrick, North Carolina Republican, and Rep. Frank R. Wolf, Virginia Republican, who warned that opaque charitable transfers made by Shariah finance advisers could end up funding terrorists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most troubling, perhaps, is the appearance of Bank Melli of Iran at the top of a listing of the world&rsquo;s top 500 Islamic financial institutions, published by the Banker in November 2008 and reproduced in the IFSC report. Bank Melli is under U.S. and EU sanctions for facilitating Tehran&rsquo;s support of Hamas and Hezbollah and funding Iran&rsquo;s uranium enrichment program. In total, Iran has six of the 10 biggest Shariah-compliant institutions and double the Shariah assets of any other country.<br>

			<p>There was a story from Minnesota several weeks ago.  How do you draw mortgages for Muslims who are opposed to interest?  Especially when you consider that the nature of mortgages is that of a lot of interest, when you compare the total interest paid over the 30 year term compared to the borrowed principle.  </p>
<p>The state has a workaround:</p>
<p>Instead of asking Muslim arrivals to adhere to American mores and customs, we&rsquo;re going to appeal to their way of life, through a little bit of legerdemain.  The state will buy a house for, e.g. $180,000, by taking out a standard bank mortgage for, e.g. 7% interest.  Ordinarily, if you do this, your monthly payment (not counting property tax and insurance eskrow) would be $1197.55.  If you make all 360 payments (30 years), you would give the bank $431,118 in aggregate.  So the state will sell the house they just bought to the Muslim purchaser for $431,118, and do so by giving him or her an interest-free 30-year loan, making the new homeowner&rsquo;s monthly payment $1197.55.  The state will then use this to pay their own monthly note to the bank.</p>
<p>The Muslim homeowner will technically get away with not paying interest.  But the fundamental question remains:  Will Allah catch wise to the trick?</p>
<p>As you know, the scam can only work as long as there is a liberal white pandering bank willing to go along.  When America becomes majority minority in the middle of this century, and it&rsquo;s not near as prosperous or as powerful as it is now, will there be the financial foundation to continue this &ldquo;program?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>     Sharia banking is merely investing with a conscience<br>
No porn,no gambling and so forth. And of course no interest which they actually do but cleverly as pointed out by previous poster. As far as supporting terrorism, that is bull. Does it really make a difference how they make money? should we prefer that they invest in tobacco, whiskey and female trafficking? Oh! Then the terrorist wouldn&rsquo;t be terrorist but Crime Syndicates.<br>
     It just shows that some parts of Islamic culture really does have some righteous motivations. It would definitely not allow Pay-Day loans and Car-title rip-offs.<br>
    Defamation of Sharia banking sense is merely a scare tactic by those who know that if it takes hold it will become difficult for predatory businesses.Infomercials would be expected to be honest. Credit card companies wouldn&rsquo;t be raising your rates because they can. Because Sharia wouldn&rsquo;t allow them that lopsided power in the first place.<br>
    Accepting Sharia money sense is not accepting Islam. It may be Islam inspired but that is it.Just the same of those societies that aren&rsquo;t Christian but have laws similar to the Ten Commandments .If it is good then what is the problem.<br>
       And Sharia funds may have suffered nearly as much as other funds The principals of these funds weren&rsquo;t responsible for the crisis. And a good argument could be made that our crisis would have been avoided if Sharia money sense was more the norm.<br>
       Before one gets hotheaded about my post I can only say please just really ignore the religious aspect. It makes more sense that way. Some people think it crazy about a burning bush and Moses being pals but understand the importance of the principals of the ten commandments. Good business ethics is good for everyone. </p>

			<p>I said before that muslims can be VERY flexible when it suits their needs or agenda, this is a prime example. I also know muslims that have enjoyed BBQ Pig pickins here in the south, like I said, flexible.</p>

			<p>The muslims changed their holy days from Thursday and Friday to Friday and Saturday. They did this because the Arab muslim bean counters figured out how much &#8220;Interest&#8221; was NOT being paid on accounts, because the Muslim Arab banks were closed for one of the interest days. Like I said, muslims are flexible, and maybe Allah won&rsquo;t notice.</p>

			<p>Finance seems at first sight to be quite different from outright warfare. </p>
<p>Nowhere is the violence of creditors more pronounced than in their destruction of education, especially economic studies and knowledge of history. The first act of the Chicago Boys (University of Chicago monetarists, headed by Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman) in Pinochet&rsquo;s Chile after the 1974 military coup was to close down every economics and social science department in the nation, except for the monetarist stronghold at the Catholic University where they held sway. The idea was to strip academia of any alternative point of view. Matters are not much different in other countries. At a post-Keynesian economics conference in Berlin on &ldquo;financialization&rdquo; last November, I heard many complaints that alternative views to Chicago School orthodoxy were unable to get a hearing in the leading European academic journals. And just this March at the Eastern Economic Association&rsquo;s annual meeting in New York City, I heard similar complaints that alternative economic ideas were excluded from the major refereed journals in which aspiring academics must gain entry in order to be promoted to tenure track jobs at most U.S. universities. An intellectual Iron Curtain has been lowered by dysfunctional &ldquo;free market&rdquo; orthodoxy. Evidently a free market in ideas is anathema to financial free marketers. With such strong intellectual control, of course, overt violence is unnecessary.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>The classical economics of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, the Progressive Era reforms and Social Democracy are rooted in the moral philosophy of the 17th- and 18th-century Enlightenment. The labor theory of value can be traced from the 13th-century Schoolmen via John Locke to Adam Smith and the Scottish Deists, via David Ricardo&rsquo;s isolation of economic rent (what Mill called the &ldquo;unearned increment&rdquo; that landowners and others receive &ldquo;in their sleep&rdquo; rather than through their own labor) as an element of price in excess of cost-value. The distinction between intrinsic value and market price led to socialist and progressive theories of a just society free of economic privilege, free of prices in excess of socially necessary costs of production and of rentier income and wealth without effort.</p>
<p>&hellip;The common thread in these ideas is that people deserve to receive the fruits of their labor. This means bringing prices in line with actual labor-costs of production. It also means that one&rsquo;s wealth should be limited to only what one creates – not land and natural resources, or monopoly privileges to extract income via control of roads, the right to create money and other natural monopolies. The aim of social reform for many centuries has been to purge capitalism of its legacy of absentee rentier property ownership patterns and creditor-oriented laws inherited from medieval times. The way to do this is to treat banking like transportation and the broadcasting spectrum, as a public utility to form a just fiscal base, not something to be privatized so that individual rentiers can tax society at large for what rightly is a public utility.</p>
<p>&hellip;Asset stripping to pay debts has caused collapse time and again in history, but is strangely downplayed in today&rsquo;s academic curriculum as an &ldquo;inconvenient truth&rdquo; as far as vested financial interests are concerned. Income is siphoned off by a scheme that is elegant and simple. Hapless victims – and now entire economies, not just individuals – are maneuvered onto a debt treadmill from which there is no escape.</p>
<p>&hellip;The product they are selling is debt. They build up their own wealth by indebting others, and then forcing sell-offs to buyers who take on their own debt in the hope of making asset-price gains as property prices are impossibly inflated relative to the wages of living labor. This has become the new, euphemistically dubbed post-industrial form of wealth creation – a strategy that is now collapsing economies throughout the world.</p>
<p>&hellip;This is the context in which today&rsquo;s financial war against Iceland is being waged. Homeowners are paying tribute, not in the form of taxes to an invading occupying force, but in interest to local sponsors of the debt pyramiding that has got Iceland into such deep trouble, and to the international creditors and enablers of this over-financialization of the economy. The nation&rsquo;s public domain, its land and geothermal resources, its tourist industry and public assets are being eyed by foreign creditors as prey to be seized in the way that has occurred in many Third World countries. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. Wasn&rsquo;t it a lack of tangible asset backing  that brought us the recent crisis?<br>
For what I know, the sharia banks also use instead of mortgages the system, where the house is a property of the bank and the customer pays rent until the house is paid back.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in muslim countries?? the muslims DO EVERYTHING you just stated they do not do!!! I have an account with NBK (National Bank of Kuwait) so I know how they work. The muslim world is also full of drunkeness, drunk driving, drug dealing/manufacture, distribution, prostitution, child slave labor, abuse of foreign nationals, stolen high end cars brought to Kuwait/Saudi from the U.S. and of course the ever popular financing of terror around the world. Somalia is muslim in case some don&rsquo;t know.</p>

			<p>The cause for our current crisis was the central bank which inflated the money supply and caused an artificial boom (the boom was artificial because lots of people believed the numbers the banks said their assets were worth) which now collapsed.<br>
<p><br>
A recession would now be the only way to clear out all the rotten and losing firms (from the banks right to GM) and get back to a healthy and sound economy. Typical recessions last for about a year and come with deflation and unemployment (because people change from useless occupations that were built up during the boom to useful occupations that create real wealth), but no change is possible without suffering.<br>
<p><br>
But the politicians won&rsquo;t allow that, Bush/Obama/Bernanke try to inflate the recession away which may have some good short-term effects, but results in an perpetual unhealthy economy and a depression that gets slowly worse from year to year.<br>
<p><br>
It was state intervention that caused this crisis and state intervention will prolong it. (Just like Hoover and FDR prolonged the 1929 recession into an over a decade long depression)<br>
<p><br>
As long as there is a central bank, there will continue to be  peace-time recessions. (All recessions before the central bank were caused by wars and by that I mean a real war ravaging the country, not some fighting thousands of miles away.)<br>
<p><br>
Americans have become believers in socialism, which is really sad. Karl Marx made the central bank one of the planks of the communist manifesto, Lenin said that the easiest way to destroy a free country is to destroy it&rsquo;s currency by inflation. The USA is following the Marxist textbook road to socialism.<br>
<p><br>
History repeats itself: Economic freedom and capitalism build up a country, then welfare statism and socialism destroy it. Just like the roman empire.<br>
<p><br>
And AmRen-posters in awe about Sharia finance, which comes from one of the most stagnant and corrupt societies in existence, I can&rsquo;t believe it&hellip;<br>

<p>The muslims are finding it easier to convert America into another muslim country (like the EU) than have all of our nasty black, mulim converts (or Somali muslims) come to their deserts.</p>
