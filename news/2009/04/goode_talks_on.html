<h1>Goode Talks on Campus Tonight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brecken Branstrator, Daily Tar Heel (University of North Carolina), April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The UNC chapter of Youth for Western Civilization is trying again.</p>
<p>After former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo was not able to finish his speech last Tuesday due to protesters, the group has invited another former U.S. Representative, Virgil Goode, to speak on campus today.</p>
<p>In the past week, many on campus have spoken out against what they saw as a limit on free speech at Tancredo&rsquo;s lecture. YWC leaders said they don&rsquo;t know whether to expect protests today.</p>
<p>Goode, who represented Virginia from 1997 to 2008 as a Democrat, Independent and Republican, said he plans on speaking mostly about affirmative action and might discuss recent and future legislation surrounding the issue.</p>
<p>He has been an outspoken opponent of affirmative action during his career.</p>
<p>Riley Matheson, the president of the campus chapter of Youth for Western Civilization, said the group invited Goode because they agree with his opinions. The lecture has been planned for several weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Youth for Western Civilization, we are not in favor of racial preferences,&#8221; Matheson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flyers on The Daily Tar Heel stands label YWC as a white supremacist group and urge students to protest today.</p>
<p>Students for a Democratic Society, which planned a peaceful [sic!] protest last week, will also be protesting today&rsquo;s speech, though group members said Tuesday they do not yet know the form it will take.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the viewpoints we expect to be portrayed in Virgil Goode&rsquo;s speech need to be spoken out against,&#8221; said member Steve Milder.</p>
<p>Members of the Carolina Hispanic Association, who wore all black in opposition to Tancredo&rsquo;s speech, are not planning to protest today, said Alicia Soto, the group&rsquo;s incoming president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Goode and Tancredo often appear at public lectures at or around the same time because their views on immigration and affirmative action are similar, Matheson said. It is those similar opinions that cause some people to think more protesting will occur.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Randy Young, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said they are preparing for the speaker and will have many police officers at the speech but do not anticipate needing to take action.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It is those similar opinions (Tancredo, Goode) that cause some people to think more protesting will occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must have taken quite a bit of effort to write &#8216;similar&rsquo; opinions in place of &#8216;controversial&rsquo; opinions. Wonder if they&rsquo;ll protest the Daily Tar Heel now? To make sure they show the appropriate &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo;.<br>

			<p>Goode and Tancredo often appear at public lectures at or around the same time because their views on immigration and affirmative action are similar,</p>
<p>Their views are also similar to the great majority of American citizen taxpaying slaves.</p>

			<p>What a flake of a University Duke is. Since most youth now get their information from the internet, I only wish they exercise their natural abilities to reason on what is right and what is wrong where Duke University, or whatever University they attend is concerned. In other words, don&rsquo;t let the progressive communists that infest these institutions brainwash you.</p>

			<p>SDS was a communist-party inspired group from the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. That is why they claim they don&rsquo;t know yet. Party leaders are known for witholding information even from their own in order to get the jump on police. I still can&rsquo;t believe they were allowed to exist in this country. Communism is the arch enemy of free-thinking peoples. They are the reason for the most of our problems today. Immigration, race relations, etc. are all communist inspired.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This movement is focused on the support of Western history, identity, high culture, and pride and opposition to radical multiculturalism, political correctness, RACIAL PREFERENCES, mass immigration, and socialism.&#8221;   &mdash;   Part of the mission statement of YWC (https://westernyouth.org/About/index.htm).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate (although understandably necessary) that YWC isn&rsquo;t more honest about race.</p>

			<p>The all-powerful Left turns reality on its head rather than debate. It doesn&rsquo;t win arguments it avoids them by changing the way issues are discussed or simply by ignoring facts. In this context Youth For Western Civilization activists are automatically racial supremacists because they oppose racial preferences. Presumably no people supporting unfair preferences for blacks are &#8220;black supremacists&#8221; although that view makes sense the more you think about it. Therein lies the incoherence of the Book of Liberal which might as well have been written by Lewis Carroll. </p>
<p>I see the always-useless Students for a Democratic Society is back to throw tantrums (hey it alleviates boredom for spoiled rich kids). Back in the sixties they had such an abiding faith in &#8220;democracy&#8221; that they supported Communism in Vietnam. But there you are, liberals live by their rules and who are we common people to question them.<br>
