<h1>Chaplain&rsquo;s E-mail Sparks Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melody Y. Hu, Harvard Crimson, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harvard Islamic chaplain Taha Abdul-Basser &#8216;96 has recently come under fire for controversial statements in which he allegedly endorsed death as a punishment for Islamic apostates. </p>
<p>In a private e-mail to a student last week, Abdul-Basser wrote that there was &#8220;great wisdom (hikma) associated with the established and preserved position (capital punishment [for apostates]) and so, even if it makes some uncomfortable in the face of the hegemonic modern human rights discourse, one should not dismiss it out of hand.&#8221; </p>
<p>The e-mail was forwarded over Muslim student e-mail lists and later picked up by the blogosphere, sparking debate and, in many cases, criticism of Abdul-Basser from those who have interpreted his statement as supporting the execution of those who leave the Islamic religion. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abdul-Basser wrote in a later e-mailed statement that he &#8220;never expressed the position that individuals who leave Islam or convert from Islam to another religion must be killed. I do not hold this opinion personally.&#8221; He explained that he was not advocating for the positions mentioned in his e-mail, but rather &#8220;addressing them in the context of the evolution of an Islamic legal doctrine.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;[Abdul-Basser] was speaking as a chaplain to a student in a private e-mail exchange. One of these e-mails was misinterpreted, misconstrued, and posted on the blogosphere,&#8221; said Harvard Islamic Society spokesperson Nafees A. Syed &#8216;10, who praised Abdul-Basser for promoting diversity within HIS and the campus at large. </p>
<p>&#8220;His immeasurable contributions should not be overlooked in this matter,&#8221; she said. <br>

			<p>Hopefully this means that the muzzies will be beheading the already disarmed leftists first. As for the rest of us, if we let the libs take our guns then we deserve to perish.</p>

			<p>The key fact is that Harvard has the need for an Islamic chaplain. Harvard was the first college founded in what was to become the U.S. It has degenerated into one more center for promoting Liberalism, Diversity, and the NWO.</p>

			<p> &ldquo;never expressed the position that individuals who leave Islam or convert from Islam to another religion must be killed. I do not hold this opinion personally.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have to, the Qu&rsquo;ran says it plainly for him which means, as I have said, blacks in America, are muslims of convenience.</p>

			<p>Whatever they say, Muslims can NEVER be trusted, because of Taqiyyah (if you don&rsquo;t know what it is, look it up).</p>

			<p>Whatever they say, Muslims can NEVER be trusted, because of Taqiyyah (if you don&rsquo;t know what it is, look it up).</p>
<p>Muslims can&rsquo;t be trusted BECAUSE they are muslims. I say, and caught a lot of flak over saying, muslims should not be allowed in the U.S. military. All muslims aren&rsquo;t terrorists it is said but it only takes 1 or 19 to do some terrible damage, so don&rsquo;t trust ANY of them.</p>
