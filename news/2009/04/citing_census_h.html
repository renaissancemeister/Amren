<h1>Citing Census, Hispanics Urge Immigration Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Saying traditional census outreach will not be enough, Hispanic groups on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to follow through now on its pledge to pass immigration reform or risk an undercount of millions of people.</p>
<p>The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, Univision Inc., the League of United Latin American Citizens and SEIU announced a grassroots campaign that would supplement Census Bureau efforts to reach the traditionally hard-to-count Hispanic community. An estimated 1 million Hispanics, or about 3 percent of the Hispanic population, were missed in 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake about it: The census cannot succeed if Latinos are not fully counted,&#8221; said Arturo Vargas, executive director of NALEO, noting that Hispanics make up half of the nation&rsquo;s percentage growth. &#8220;We are the future of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said a halt to immigration raids is not enough and referred to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s pledge on immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;That needs to be decided today, not in the 2010 census,&#8221; Vargas said.</p>
<p>Ruben Keoseyan, publisher of La Raza newspaper, expressed concern about a mixed message where Hispanic groups work to build trust in immigrant communities only to have it destroyed if the government conducts a raid days later. &#8220;The federal government plays an important role in augmenting what we are doing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a news conference, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said they were opposed to suspending enforcement of immigration laws to improve the census count. They noted that Obama has a &#8220;bully pulpit&#8221; as president to emphasize that sending in the government form is safe and won&rsquo;t be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or IRS tax collectors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Hispanic groups said their media and education campaign will extend not only to California, Texas and Florida, which have high numbers of Hispanics, but also to newly emerging Hispanic areas in Georgia, the Carolinas and Arkansas.</p>
<p>There are nearly 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., many of them clustered in states such as California, New York, Florida and Texas, which stand to either lose House seats or gain fewer seats depending on whether their Hispanic communities are fully counted.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigrants should count as zero for apportioning House seats. When constituting our government they should not even be taken into consideration. And illegal border crossers are not immigrants, they are criminals.</p>

			<p>This all has to do with the proposal to use statistical sampling to arrive at more accurate numbers for the black and Hispanic population.  Traditional census methods (i.e. counting actual people) undercounts blacks and Hispanics for their transiency.</p>
<p>Use your common sense.  Blacks dominate every major city in the country just about, and we&rsquo;re supposed to believe that they&rsquo;re &#8220;only&#8221; 13% of the whole country?  Same for Hispanics.</p>
<p>If the Democrats think that telling the truth about the black and Hispanic population would help them, they are mistaken.  It might be the thing that wakes up enough white people, as if it were a slap upside the head about their own dispossession, so that they might do something about it, i.e. join the CofCC and subscribe to AR.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Make no mistake about it: The census cannot succeed if Latinos are not fully counted,&rsquo; said Arturo Vargas, executive director of NALEO, noting that Hispanics make up half of the nation&rsquo;s percentage growth. &#8216;We are the future of the United States.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Comrade Vargas, the only sane conclusion to be drawn is, that the United States has no future!</p>
<p>That is, unless it is to become a Mexico North? Which means it only has: poverty, illiteracy, disease, and lawlessness, as its future to look forward to. Do you really think that is what the USA really needs or wants, beyond a corrupt and incestuous clique of plutocrats and Communists?  </p>
<p>Perhaps, roughly 200 million whites, and for that matter about 32 million blacks, might have different (if also conflicting) ideas about just such a scenario?  And they make up what percent of the current total population?</p>
<p>232/300 equals 77.3%, and if you factor in the rest of the population that is not &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino,&#8221; it works out to be about 87%. Is that our unquestioned and collective &#8220;Hispanic future;&#8221; or perhaps is it a warning, for a much needed reassessment and redirection of that &#8220;Hispanic future&#8221; by the other (at least nominally 87%) of linguistically/culturally similar people of this land?</p>
<p>You know, the ones that have at the very least, English as a common language and toilets as normal human body waste disposal units!</p>
<p>Enough said, other than, God Help Us All!!!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We are the future of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a logical fallacy because if Hispanics become the majority then the United States will no longer be the United States,it will simply be an extension of Latin America,i.e the third world.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s definitely going to be a strong push for &#8216;sampling&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s going to result in inflated numbers.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t pass last time but this time it&rsquo;s likely to.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are nearly 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., many of them clustered in states such as California, New York, Florida and Texas&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
12M is the &#8220;official&#8221; estimate of their unofficial numbers, the one usually accepted/repeated by the MSM. I&rsquo;ve seen &#8220;unofficial&#8221; estimates as high as 38M.</p>
<p>And while 38M may be too high, 12M is certainly too low. Anyone who&rsquo;s been to the SW lately will confirm there must be AT LEAST that many in S. California alone. </p>
<p>My own best guesstimate splits the difference at somewhere around 20M. (Your mileage may vary.) </p>
<p>Although we AmRenners could argue with the actual figure until the sun comes up, one thing about the number of illegals is undeniable: it&rsquo;s WAY too damned high! </p>
<p>And nothing short of a vigorous, unapologetic deportation campaign like we had under Ike in the &rsquo;50s (&#8220;Operation W*****k&#8221;) can EVER hope to correct this unnatural and nation-threatening historical abomination. </p>
<p>Mestizos as &#8220;the future of the United States&#8221;?</p>
<p>Only if you want a future that looks, acts, and smells like Tijuana. </p>

			<p>I have noticed in this, like many mainstream media articles, the outdated and vastly understated number of &#8220;nearly 12 million illegal immigrants&#8221; is reported.  Contrast this with the reporting of an ever expanding number and greater percentages of the Hispanic population in the United States.  Therefore, illegal immigration has stopped, and the growth of Hispanics is caused by soley legal means.  I suppose there is no one at the AP who can understand basic mathematics.</p>
<p>The increasing assertiveness of the Hispanic advocacy groups is a real cause for concern as they believe they can make, or at least heavily influence public policy now that Obama is president.  The tail is now trying to wag the dog and the foolish whites who voted for Obama will find themselves overwhelmed by peoples who care little for them, their culture, or values.</p>

<p>Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p>The federal government, against the wishes of the American people, has aided and abetted massive immigration from the Hispanic Third World. This is done to create a new slave class and displace and bankrupt White Americans by forcing them to pay huge entitlement services for these low IQ&rsquo;d people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks dominate every major city in the country just about, and we&rsquo;re supposed to believe that they&rsquo;re &#8220;only&#8221; 13% of the whole country?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are thousands of counties in the US. Relatively few of these counties are urban.</p>
<p>There are many hundreds of counties, in the rural North, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest and the Intermountain West, where Whites comprise well over 90% of the population. </p>
<p>Even in northern Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, there are numerous counties where Whites are more than 90% of the population.</p>
<p>You could literally travel from coast to coast through the northern tier of states, sticking to the rural areas, and never realize that there&rsquo;s such a thing as Black people.</p>
<p>As of the 2000 Census, 1 out of 4 whites lived in a rural place. For Blacks I think the figure was 1 out of 7 or 8, concentrated, of course, in the rural South.</p>
<p>Here in Upstate NY the central cities have a large Black presence, the suburban areas much less so. In rural areas you&rsquo;d very rarely see a Black person.</p>
<p>Our situation is bad, but not fatal (yet).</p>

			<p>Just the other day, i was in a local post office, and i overheard a older gentleman say to someone standing next to him that he was a plumber. Being that my younger brother is a plumber and has his own business(a family business for the last forty five years,) i could not help mentioning to him how the local hispanic plumbers are taking a lot of work from my brother and other established white plumbing businesses. </p>
<p>His response to me was; this is no longer a county, it is a world. </p>
<p>I have never heard anyone quite put it like that.  </p>

In other words, America needs to stop enforcing it&rsquo;s immigration laws and enact amnesty as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Sadly, it is highly probable that Latinos ARE the future of America.  American Whites have been thoroughly and purposely programmed to reject any notion of White solidarity, but to celebrate and support the solidarity of other races that are working feverishly to displace them.  </p>
<p>Lulled into passive complacency by the continual diversity propaganda from their churches, schools, employers, government, and media, American Whites can not even muster enough interest in their approaching demise to be bothered to control their nation&rsquo;s borders.  This leads to the incredible scenario of illegal invaders DEMANDING that they be counted and given amnesty, while their legal citizen racial kinsmen campaign aggressively to steer benefits their way.</p>
<p>Whites do not question why the American Latino groups lobby in favor of amnesty.  If asked, they will respond that it must be out of &#8220;good intentions&#8221;, or a desire to reunite families.  They simply refuse to grasp the obvious - that the push for amnesty is an open and blatant push for more POWER for the Latino community.  Ethnic realpolitik is playing out right in front of our eyes, against our own interests, and the majority of our people refuse to recognize the threat&hellip; much less respond to it by banding together to work in the interest of their own race.</p>
<p>Western Man MUST AWAKEN, or our civilization and nations will be overrun and remade in the image of our 3rd world invaders.  It&rsquo;s happening right in front of America&rsquo;s eyes, right now, every day.</p>

			<p>     How long are they going to use that phony statistic of 12 million invaders.They&rsquo;ve been quoting that same number for 10 years.So i guess we haven&rsquo;t had any illegals comig over our borders for the last decade.Right.</p>

			<p>No, Senor Vargas, you are NOT the future of the United States. You are the DEATH of the United States. Why not urge those criminally inventive minds to change their own country and leave ours alone? We have our own problems at the moment, but Americans bounce back. We can promise you that if you keep your illegals home, we won&rsquo;t break into Mexico. In fact, as soon as we get a leader who puts Americans first, we&rsquo;ll finish the wall and not give Mexico a second thought.</p>

<p>This guy reveals his moronic thought processes with his asinine statements better than an entire essay could.  </p>
<p>By all means let&rsquo;s make certain we count all the metizos in order to determine the correct number of people who regard Mexico as a failed, corrupt state whose leaders have such low ability they can&rsquo;t provide decent jobs for at least 75% of their population.  Only then can we accurately judge the complete failure that country has degenerated to.  </p>
<p>Mexico now has about the same number of police and military as the cartels who are equipped with Mexican weapons from their deserters who number well over 100,000 these last few years.</p>
<p>If the drug gangs can agree on a truce and unite under one leadership, the state of Mexico belongs to them.  They could take it over tomorrow, if they so desired, and the ironic thing is that most of the present politicians could remain in their jobs, because they&rsquo;re on cartel payroll anyway.  The same could be said of the police.  Also, the few in the military who are not taking drug money would quickly switch allegiance, I&rsquo;m certain, after the takeover is quickly accomplished.  The cartels would give them an offer they can&rsquo;t refuse.</p>

When I first  visited New York City as a teenager, many years ago, I was told by my uncle, &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t America, this is the united nations.&#8221;  I still remember that.</p>
<p>He was being sarcastic but he was right, as time has proven, and from NY where the rot had already set in and gotten established, it has spread to much the rest of the country now. By now, most of those white inhabitants, except the rich, have long since fled. This is what is in store for everyone. That was half a century ago, but imagine what America will look like in half a century more.  It&rsquo;s no longer  a nation.  It really has become the &#8220;united nations&#8221;.</p>

<p>Arturo Vargas&rsquo; logic: &#8220;we broke in and entered your country, so give us the rest of it.&#8221; We should reform immigration all right: deport as many illegals as possible and sieze control of our borders. Mexico could be our example, since they control illegal immigration (from Guatemala) far better than we do. If Americans just once saw the government seriously TRY to stop the invasion, they would be surprised and inspired to see just how feasible it always was. Then the US might actually HAVE a future.  </p>
