<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States Supreme Court made it easier for immigrants seeking to avoid deportation to get another chance at a court hearing.</p>
<p>The decision came in the case of Jean Marc Nken, who came to the United States in 2001 and did not leave when his visa expired.</p>
<p>Nken has since applied for asylum, married a U.S. citizen and had a child, who also is an American. But immigration authorities and federal courts have repeatedly rejected asylum claims, which include the prospect of persecution if he is sent back to the African nation of Cameroon, where he says he was detained and beaten for participating in anti-government protests.</p>
<p>The federal appeals courts have split on what standard to apply to requests to temporarily block deportation while taking another look at immigration cases. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., applied a very tough standard to Nken&rsquo;s request for a stay and rejected it.</p>
<p>But Chief Justice John Roberts, writing the 7-2 decision, overturned the appeals court and sent it back for reconsideration, saying courts should use a less stringent standard. &#8220;The whole idea is to hold the matter under review in abeyance because the appellate court lacks sufficient time to decide the merits,&#8221; Roberts said.</p>
<p>But justices warned the courts not to start routinely offering stays in deportation cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The alien must show both irreparable injury and a likelihood of success on the merits, in addition to establishing that the interest of the parties and the public weigh in his or her favor,&#8221; Justice Anthony Kennedy said.</p>
<p>And the threat of deportation isn&rsquo;t enough to show irreparable injury, Roberts said. &#8220;Aliens who are removed may continue to pursue their petitions for review, and those who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return,&#8221; Roberts said.</p>

			<p>Just think how much worse this will get when Obama gets a couple of his appointees in the Supreme Court.  Obama has said that he believes in a &#8220;living Constitution&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s liberal code for letting left wing judges decide what they want the law to be and then pretending that the Constitution requires it by perceiving unheard of &#8220;rights&#8221; within its penumbras and emanations.  In short,<br>
a &#8220;living&#8221; Constitution is a dead Constitution.</p>

			<p>The supreme court is nothing but an establishment appointee run kangaroo court. What do you expect?  our establishment has decreed multiculturalism and internationalism are the rule of the day. The supreme kangaroo court simply does whats expected of it.</p>

			<p>Its all part of our establishments &#8220;progressive&#8221; agenda.  A few years ago I had an epiphany. That epiphany was, that the people at the top who run our nation such as the president and a large number of members in congress and the supreme court had absolutely no semblance of patriotism whatsoever and they were just very ruthless ambitious people who had clawed their way to the top and used the United States and its taxpaying citizens to advance their own positions in life.  Not to mention forming powerful groups that meet behind closed doors along with people in the private sectors to decide how the evolution of America will be carried out.  Remember these justices used to be lawyers.  How honest do feel lawyers are in general?  Have you ever heard of judges being described as a cross between a lawyer and a politician. This court is good at one thing I&rsquo;ll give it that and that is putting dog and pony shows on for the public and continuing to fool the public into believeing that its some sort of independent decision making entity.</p>

			<p>Chief, you said it well. For the majority of politicians who sit in Congress and the Senate, what actually helps the American citizenry is irrelevant to them, in fact, the concept of citizens is an irrelevancy to these theives. Americans are a number, an economic unit, to be exploited and used for the elites own purposes. Yes Chief, I had the same epiphany you did, many years ago. All politics in todays America, truly is a series of dog and pony shows, meant to distract the citizenry from how badly they are being screwed. </p>
