			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neely Tucker, Washington Post, April 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Long ago and far away, she was an unnamed little princess in a little story called the &#8220;The Frog Prince.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And then one day, through the magical powers of Disney animation and commercial marketing, the forgotten little princess was transformed into Tiana, a beautiful black princess from New Orleans. She became the star of &#8220;The Princess and the Frog,&#8221; a movie set to premiere in November. Her doll and toy set were unveiled last month, and the Disney promotional machine is already humming, for Tiana is the first Disney princess in more than a decade, and the first ever to be black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The implied message of Tiana, that black American girls can be as elegant as Snow White herself, is a milestone in the national imagery, according to a range of scholars and cultural historians.</p>
<p>Her appearance this holiday season, coming on the heels of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s emergence as the nation&rsquo;s first lady, the Obama girls in the White House and the first line of Barbie dolls modeled on black women (&#8220;So in Style&#8221; debuts this summer), will crown an extraordinary year of visibility for African American women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If this figure takes off, you&rsquo;re looking at 30 or 40 years of repetition and resonance,&#8221; says Tricia Rose, a Brown University professor who teaches both popular culture and African American studies, citing the enduring popularity of Disney princesses at the company&rsquo;s theme parks, on Web sites and in videos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s the first modern American [Disney] princess, and that she&rsquo;s black sends a huge message,&#8221; says Cori Murray, entertainment director for Essence magazine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Disney version, Tiana is a young waitress and talented chef who dreams, like her father, of owning her own restaurant. She eventually kisses a frog and is transformed into one. She must journey into the dark bayou to get a magical cure from a good voodoo queen. She is aided by a goofy firefly and a trumpet-playing alligator. The frog turns out to be handsome Prince Naveen, from the far-off and fictional land of Maldonia.</p>
<p>The stills released by the studio show Tiana in full princess regalia: a powder-blue gown, tiara and hair in an elegant upsweep.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first goal is to make a great motion picture,&#8221; says John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, who is overseeing the project. &#8220;But we have also worked very closely with a lot of leaders in the African American community, all across the nation, to make sure we&rsquo;re doing something African American families will be proud of. It&rsquo;s very important for us to do it right. We&rsquo;ve been very careful and cognizant about what we&rsquo;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says it was Clements and Musker&rsquo;s idea to make Tiana black, and he stresses that Tiana will be one of the &#8220;strongest&#8221; Disney heroines yet. The criticisms the film got over the character&rsquo;s name in early drafts (&#8220;Maddy,&#8221; short for Madeline, was perceived by some to sound like a &#8220;slave name&#8221;) were only hiccups on the way to a finished product, he says, noting that one of his most popular creations, Buzz Lightyear in &#8220;Toy Story,&#8221; was named &#8220;Tempest&#8221; at one point.</p>
<p>The message that Tiana learns in the film  &mdash;  Disney characters always learn something by movie&rsquo;s end  &mdash;  is that balance is important in life. Jazz Age woman that she is, Tiana needs both love and a career to find happiness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murray says she was pleased the studio is portraying Tiana with skin of a &#8220;darker hue&#8221; and slightly full lips. Tarshia Stanley, a professor of English at Spelman College in Atlanta who often writes and teaches about portrayals of black women in film, says that the character&rsquo;s hair  &mdash;  straight and pulled back in early images released by the studio  &mdash;  seems to be the appropriate, middle-of-the-road bet, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might as well make it straight so little girls can comb it when the doll comes out,&#8221; she notes, wryly. &#8220;We as African American women haven&rsquo;t fully dealt with how sensitive the subject of our hair can be, so I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t expect Disney to know what to do with [that issue].&#8221;</p>
<p>(Prince Naveen, for the record, is neither white nor black, but portrayed with olive skin, dark hair and, need we state the obvious, a strong chin. The actor who plays him, Bruno Campos, hails from Brazil.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The films featuring the darker-hued heroines  &mdash;  &#8220;Pocahontas,&#8221; &#8220;Aladdin&#8221; and &#8220;Mulan&#8221;  &mdash;  were much different from the Cinderella-at-the-ball idea of a princess. Pocahontas drew on the real-life travails of her Native American namesake, and Mulan was a warrior who spent most of the film disguised as a man. The two films have had mixed receptions among their real-life ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Tayac, a Piscataway Indian and historian at the National Museum of the American Indian, has taken her daughter to Disney World and says the &#8220;princess breakfast&#8221; the resort offers children (with real-life actresses portraying the fictional characters) was &#8220;heaven&#8221; to her child. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come across as a scold. But, as an adult, she says, &#8220;Pocahontas&#8221; often makes her wince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pocahontas was presented in an almost Frederick&rsquo;s of Hollywood costume,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The movie turned out to be more damage control for Native American parents than a moment of pride. It was nothing you wanted your daughter to grow up to be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have never seen little Native American girls try to dress up as Pocahontas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Yang, editor in chief of &#8220;Secret Identities: The Asian American Superhero Anthology,&#8221; also writes about Asian pop culture for the San Francisco Chronicle. He says that the Disney adaptation of the Chinese story of the warrior Mulan brought a &#8220;sigh of relief&#8221; from Asian American parents.</p>

			<p><i>The stills released by the studio show Tiana in full princess regalia: a powder-blue gown, tiara and hair in an elegant upsweep.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the stills and they more or less present her as a Caucasian with a dark skin tone. What is the problem with portraying her as a strong and proud African woman like the ones we used to see in National Geographic?</p>
<p>And since when did &#8220;Tiana&#8221; become an African name? I just did a quick search on it and found that &#8220;Tiana&#8221; is Greek for &#8220;Princess&#8221;. I guess she must be a descendant of the black Cleopatra&hellip;</p>

			<p>As you can already see from the article, no matter what Disney does, it will be met by the black audience with many complaints. As for myself, I have no interest, since my daughters are both adults now. I would like to think that I would have used this as a teachable moment, but who knows?  When my daughters were young enough to enjoy such cartoons, I was still of the mind that race was immaterial. Live and learn&hellip;<br>

			<p>As a black woman I&rsquo;m very excited about this movie. The media is always partnering black men with non-black women. Its about time black women were paired with some one else.  Black men are making a lot of noise about this movie, its because they don&rsquo;t want black women(the creme of the crop ones) to wake up and realize they too have options. They don&rsquo;t want any competiton because this would mean they would have to change their behavior( get married, hold a job, father legitamit   children, be reliable and responsible, etc).</p>

			<p>Disney and Mattel are setting themselves up for a marketing failure. In the past, Mattel discovered it could only market white Barbies to black and Asian girls. What makes Disney or Mattel think they can market a black Barbie and princess, now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Obama&rsquo;s influence does not extend to the psyche of little girls.</p>

			<p>when my daughter was a little girl, she loved the Little Mermaid. We must have watched the VCR over a hundred times.</p>
<p>That pretty lil mermaid had no feet! But it was entertaining for a little girl who sang along with all the songs.</p>
<p>This latest &#8220;model&#8221; for little girls uses some brown ink or whatever they call it in today&rsquo;s computer generated films. She has feet. The movie is not great art, as no Disney movie has been arguably &#8216;art&rsquo; since the mid 50&rsquo;s, Peter Pan, Pinnochio, Sleeping Beauty, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commercialism among many violent movies. Given what else is out there, I hope the kids like it. Hollywood commits greater offenses against whites and Western Civilization each and every day.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just let Disney be Disney?  I thought the whole point of Disney was originally to make Americanized adaptations of old European stories and fairytales.  </p>
<p>I was a little girl when &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; came out. The only thing that was &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; and &#8220;hip&#8221; about that one was the crab that talked with a Jamaican accent in an otherwise fully European setting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long after that that I went to Disney World for the first time. At that time, every single Disney princess up to that point was still European, thank goodness.  The Disney World from when I was little was a land of castles and blonde princesses. I&rsquo;m sorry, but to me, Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, Mulan, Pocahontas, and then this black princess, will never be &#8220;Disney&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>If minorities need their own princesses, then why don&rsquo;t they form their own networks and animation companies?  We don&rsquo;t need to be corrupting Disney.  </p>

			<p>Today, a movie is not just a movie. It&rsquo;s a message. It&rsquo;s a symbol. It&rsquo;s an allegory. It&rsquo;s a rallying point. <br>
How about making movies that are for entertainment - not for political purposes?</p>

			<p>In de foties, there were a few brilliant spoofs on the Brothers Grimm (among them showing Lil Red Ridin´Hood as a stripper seducing the countrybumpkin Wolf).<br>
But look at &#8220;Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs&#8221; (1943) for comparison in the actual case -<br>
no one would dare show it to children nowadays, though there is no sex or violence whatsoever.<br>

			<p>The only people that are going to see this fairy tale are blacks and pandering guilt-ridden whites.  The same whites that took their daughters and/or allowed their daughters to see the movie &#8220;Save the Last Dance.&#8221;  </p>
<p>When Save the Last Dance came out, I was standing at the checkout counter at the GAP store and a white woman with her approximately 11-13 year old daughter was conversing with a sales person and exclaiming at the top of her lungs how she had just taken her daughter to see &#8220;Save the Last Dance&#8221; and recommended that everybody take their pre-teen and teenage daughters to see it, because &#8220;it was such a wonderful experience and a great movie.&#8221;   </p>
<p>I have a 9 year old granddaughter and there is no way in hell that Disney will get any money from me for this movie.  So the little black girls now have their own fairy princess - well so be it.  But I don&rsquo;t have to have it shoved down my throat.</p>

			<p>My daughter is five. Most of the Disney princess merchandise has only one princess on it. In the case where there a multiples it&rsquo;s usually three white princesses. I certainly will not be buying any Disney merchandise that features a non-white character of any sort.</p>

			<p>Relax&hellip; There is no model for a black princess (Michelle Obama is the most beautiful and smartest woman in the world???&hellip; PLEASSSSSSE).  Just like Marilyn Monroe was the model for Tinkerbell, a white model will be used for Tiana.  They&rsquo;ll just paint in black.  Everybody, including black people, knows what it is.</p>
<p>However, they CAN use Janet Napolitano as a model for the evil villain and paint it white and a man.  The man part doesn&rsquo;t even need any alteration.</p>

			<p>Good for Disney. The reason they&rsquo;ve never had a Black princess before is that they play to fantasy, and most little girls acrosss America, I think, don&rsquo;t fantasize about being a Black princess. An American Indian princess is adventurous, an Arabian Nights princess is exotic, but I&rsquo;m not sure that this one will fly. </p>
<p>Disney is a private company and this is America. More power to them if they want to push the envelope, and the market will be the ultimate arbitrar. </p>
<p>But Black activists should be careful what they wish for. This movie will have to rack up some pretty amazing box office numbers to come close to The Little Mermaid, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast or any of the others. If the movie tanks, it will be a long time before Disney or another major company takes a similar chance.</p>

<p>I have some bad news for you.  If after 50 years of school desegregation, &#8220;Great Society&#8221; and Affirmative Action programs, black males haven&rsquo;t changed their behavior, silly movies like this sure aren&rsquo;t going to help.</p>

			<p>This seems redundant.  Half of the black female population already think of themselves as queens.  Apparently every African was bona fide aristocracy before evil Whitey came along and wrecked the planet&rsquo;s most advanced society.</p>
