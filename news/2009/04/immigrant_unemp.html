<h1>Immigrant Unemployment at Record High: Rate Now Exceeds Native-Born, A Change From Recent Past</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Center for Immigration Studies, April 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report finds immigrant unemployment (legal and illegal) was higher in the first quarter of 2009 than at any time since 1994, when immigrants were first separated out in the monthly data. This represents a change from the recent past when native-born Americans tended to have higher unemployment rates. The findings show that immigrants have been harder hit by the recession than natives. Although data on immigrants is collected, it is generally not published by the government. This report is one of the few to examine this data.</p>
<p>The report, entitled, &#8220;Trends in Immigrant and Native Employment,&#8221; is embargoed until Wednesday midnight, for publication on Thursday, April, 30. Advance copies are available to the media. The study will be available online at: www.cis.org.</p>
<p>The report also contains employment data for Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington State.</p>
<p>The report is coauthored by Dr. Steven Camarota, the Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies and Karen Jensenius a Research Demographer at the Center.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Steven Camarota at (202) 466-8185 or sac@cis.org<br>

			<p>Have they separated the data for legal and illegal immigrants?  My bet is that since many of the legal immigrants are here on H-1B visas, they have a lower unemployment rate because they&rsquo;re cheap labor.</p>

According to the 1986 Reagan &#8220;one-time-only&#8221; Amnesty, no illegals should be employed because employers were supposed to require proof of legal residency.</p>

			<p>As with all things non-white, whites will forever look for ways to act on their racism undercover of some other &#8220;issue.&#8221;  When the immigrants were working?  Punish them for taking &#8220;our&#8221; jobs.  When they are unemployed?  Deport them for being lazy and on welfare.  The bottomline is that whites are fundamentally an anti-social lot.</p>

<p>By all means leave the USA then. We are tired of &#8220;wealth redistribution&#8221; to people like you and ones that should not be in this country in the first place. Just wait until an illegal alien replaces you on the job, unless you are on welfare, then I guess it don&rsquo;t matter than. And FYI - illegal aliens can&rsquo;t stand black people and are making a point of killing your brothers and sisters in LA! So in other words illegal aliens hurt YOUR people as well.</p>

			<p>The immigrant unemployment problem will get far worse, and I kind of doubt that more than a handful will return home, so it&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see how this administration will handle the situation.</p>
<p>Also, note that reports lately in the news tell us that Mexico is in the beginning of a rapidly spreading swine flue pandemic, where businesses, schools, events, etc., are closed, obviously adding to their financial woes, because they&rsquo;ve been hit harder by the global meltdown than the US.</p>
<p>With all these factors converging at one time will this mean a run for the US border by millions of them, especially if they can get amnesty as Obama promised? </p>
<p>Does anybody think we can handle the extra inundation or will it cause us to drop faster and further until the country is insolvent?</p>

			<p>Hey Black Insurgent, I&rsquo;ll be delighted if an illegal immigrant or cheap H-1b worker gets your job.  And if being an &#8220;anti-social lot&#8221; is measured by rates of violent crime, your race is at the top of the heap.</p>

			<p>Third World aliens have a higher unemployment rate than us native born citizens?</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t be; after all the liberal media said they were here to do the work that us lazy Americans didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>

<p>And we Whites are also very, very good at genocide when we finally decide to do it. We are soooooo good at it in fact, that if nothing else is available, we will war amongst ourselves. Only ANTS will do that in nature you know.</p>

			<p>I see there is a &#8220;Back insurgent&#8221; posting.  My older version of the Oxford English dictionary confirms my understanding of the word, a rebel, and a revolutionary (terrorist?).   As an ex-South African who is not only seeing South &gt;Africa descending to the same level as Zimbabwe and most other African countries, I regret voting for t end of Apartheid when it will claerly show not to have been in te interests of the population especially the black people qs now they have despotic black leaders who murdred their way to power and now live high on the hog, while making a real mess of administering the countries.  Maby in the black masses are  worse off now with seriously violent crime causing the unlawful deaths of many more balck people in te 15 years since the ANC came to power than in the 44 years of Apartheid.  I already regret voting for the end and when the natural event of global warming arrives and droughts cause massive famines because the African blacks (except those in Zambia and Mozambique where the Ex-Zimbabwe white farmers have been welcomed because the blacks in these black run countries are hungry) have murdered the white African farmerts(3045 so far in SA since 1994), but we will see if the trend continues to its end as historically shown in other African countries.   Of course, we in the West will have massive demands for food and aid (again) because &#8220;we caused global warming&#8221; with our industries, whereas Artic exploration (ice cores) show that past global warming resulted in higher CO2, not te reverse. </p>

<p>Whites this and Whites that and etc. etc. etc. .<br>
Look at your own racist black race.  Blacks are the most racist people in the USA, just ask the Hispanics who they prefer to live or work with and it is always the Whites. At least the immigrants haven&rsquo;t been on the White welfare roles for 200 years while complaining about the same people who pay taxes to support them. </p>

			<p>I think this was bound to happen sooner or later. But that is just how it goes and the immigrants need to come to terms with the reality of America&rsquo;s financial problems. I still think the immigrants will continue to flood America due to the fact that the only way to stop them is by inspecting corporations for illegal workers, which the government seems to ignore completely in-order to keep their corporate dollars rolling in.</p>

<p>The bottom line, my friend, is that blacks cannot reason and logic in an adequate fashion in order to arrive at sound decisions, and nowhere is it better displayed that in your comments.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shallow, and reveal an inability to understand even a simple problem.  That&rsquo;s why black societies fail all over the world, not just Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p>

			<p> Mr. Insurgent; Most whites have been entirely consistent about illegal immigrants. Nobody thinks they are lazy..NOBODY. Also few, if any are on welfare. Most sympathize with their situation and only have a problem with the number of undocumented taking jobs that Americans should have and using up taxpayer resources that Americans should have. Whites admire the hard-working nature and strong family structure of Latinos. <br>
 If you have been here for any length of time you will notice most hostility goes to business owners (usually white) who employ illegal workers in order to raise profits, avoid payroll taxes, healthcare, overtime, etc&hellip; and exploiting illegals at the same time shafting American workers.<br>
  White admiration for Latino/Americans can be seen everyday at white owned businesses. Look how many Latino workers are employed in white -owned businesses. At the same time look how many African-Americans work alongside them. I am a business owner with 21 employees, 10 latino, 9 white, 2 asian. Ive hired four blacks in the past ALL with disasterous results. I will not do that again.<br>
  What you see as &#8220;racism&#8221; is actually the result of lifetimes of exposures to various ethnic groups. Whites dont have issues with latinos, asians, indians or even african immigrants. It is only the African Americans with their warped sense of entitlement, low self-image, various shoulder chips and extremely thin skin who most people choose to avoid. Recent immigrants from Africa who drive cabs will not pick up African Americans, try to explain that. Racism isnt to blame, perhaps it is because they have been robbed or ran out on so many times they are wary.<br>
  But if &#8220;racism&#8221; makes you feel good&hellip;..so be it</p>

			<p>I gotta say something here about this &#8220;black insurgent&#8221; character and I&rsquo;ll never comment on it again.What makes you think he&rsquo;s/she&rsquo;s a person of color? Sounds like a typical liberal guilt ridden white to me,but that&rsquo;s not the content of my comment.It&rsquo;s simple really,STOP RESPONDING (encouraging) TO HIS POST! If you do this he will go away.Please consider my suggestion. I will &#8220;not&#8221; comment on this matter again. Thank you for your time and as always, Teach your children well&hellip;.</p>
