			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paloma Esquivel, Los Angeles Times, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As they sipped tea and nibbled on dates, more than 100 men and women listened to a litany of speakers sounding the same message: The FBI is not your friend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the months and years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, FBI officials met privately with Muslim leaders, assuring them that a spate of hate crimes would be vigorously investigated and at the same time asking for help in the campaign against terrorism. Local leaders promised to encourage cooperation.</p>
<p>But even as relations warmed, a series of revelations  &mdash;  including allegations that the FBI sent an informant into a mosque in Orange County, surveilled community leaders and sent an agent to UC Irvine  &mdash;  caused some to begin questioning the FBI&rsquo;s real intentions.</p>
<p>Now, the leaders of several Muslim organizations say they feel betrayed. Because Orange County has been at the center of many of the revelations, local leaders have taken a lead in challenging the FBI, but the issues are resonating nationwide. </p>
<p>On Sunday, a coalition of the nation&rsquo;s largest Muslim organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Islamic Society of North America, issued a statement demanding that the Obama administration address FBI actions, including what they describe as the &#8220;infiltration of mosques,&#8221; the use of &#8220;agent provocateurs to trap unsuspecting Muslim youth&#8221; and the &#8220;deliberate vilification&#8221; of the council.</p>
<p>&#8220;It reached a level where we felt we had to do something,&#8221; said Agha Saeed, chairman of the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections. &#8220;The FBI is doing things which are not healthy. They are creating divisions and conflict, creating a totally negative, Islamophobic image of Muslims in America.&#8221; </p>
<p>Over the years, there&rsquo;s been a gradual erosion of trust between the groups and the FBI. Months ago, the agency told local leaders it was suspending relations with the council, one of the largest Muslim civil rights groups in the country. </p>
<p>Since then, things have unraveled rapidly. Like other Muslim communities in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, many in Orange County  &mdash;  home to more than 100,000 Muslim Americans, dozens of mosques and several prominent Muslim community organizations  &mdash;  worried about FBI investigations.</p>
<p>The FBI, in turn, believed terrorists were either trying to get to Southern California to carry out attacks or were already here. To gain intelligence and demystify the agency&rsquo;s operations, the FBI met with local leaders and formed a committee that met monthly. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations was named in 2007, along with hundreds of other organizations and individuals, as an unindicted co-conspirator in a case against the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation, which the government accused of funneling money to terrorists. </p>
<p>As a result, the FBI suspended relations with the council this year.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe today&rsquo;s FBI is a &#8220;friend&#8221; to pro-American, racially-conscious whites either.  Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wong.<br>

			<p>Muslims do not belong in any civilized country and they don&rsquo;t belong in the U.S. military. Muslims cannot be trusted, period.</p>

			<p>  Before I even started reading the article, I knew cair had to be behind it. These people have no respect for anybody outside the muslim faith. If it were up to me, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any muslims left in this country.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.the use of &ldquo;agent provocateurs to trap unsuspecting Muslim youth&rdquo; and the &ldquo;deliberate vilification&rdquo; of the council.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, if a Muslim &#8220;youth&#8221; agrees with a provacateur that committing a bombing is a good idea and eagerly wants to participate he&rsquo;s being &#8220;trapped&#8221; by the agent?</p>
<p>Well, now, that&rsquo;s no good.  I mean, isn&rsquo;t that like unjustly stopping two black males by racial profiling just because they&rsquo;re driving slowly back and forth past a store that has been robbed numerous times by blacks?</p>
<p>Such racism!  Darling little non-whites just don&rsquo;t have a fair chance when the evil police are honkies.<br>

			<p>Moslems were not listed on the Nepollotano Gastapo Report on terrorists.  The GREAT SATAN OBAMA will no longer refere to Tela Ban terrorists as terrorist or the War on Terror but he calls Whites, Catholics, Veterans, and the Amish people terrorists.  </p>

			<p>Muslims, like members of another religion I won&rsquo;t name, have a hive mentality. The tribe&rsquo;s interests come first and foremost, the end justifies the means if it was for the good of the tribe, and loyalty is to the tribe only. If you do anything the tribe perceives to be against its interests, you are considered an enemy even by people you believed were &#8220;American first.&#8221;</p>
<p>People can say I&rsquo;m &#8220;racist&#8221; for saying so, but it&rsquo;s the truth.</p>

			<p>If sending in agents and infiltrators into Mosques is all they&rsquo;re doing, then these CAIR groups should stop complaining, because they have it pretty good compared to the right wing.</p>
<p>Federal LEAs do a whole lot worse when it comes to the organized right wing in America:  They actually provoke and run the most extreme elements.  Want to find two FBI agents?  Look for three &#8220;kluxers.&#8221;  Last summer, an FBI agent was found to be leading a Tampa area &#8220;neo Nazi&#8221; group (and probably most of the other members were FBI, too.)  The church bombing in Birmingham in 1965 (?) that killed four black girls?  The FBI did it, at least its &#8220;informants&#8221; and maybe its agents.  Mainly because LBJ wanted civil rights legislation, and I won&rsquo;t be convinced that LBJ didn&rsquo;t either countenance it or actually order it.  He was that much of a Machiavellian.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious.  At least when there is no legislation to push, a George Mason University Ph.D. thesis earlier this decade proved the symbiotic relationship between Federal law enforcement and the Paranoia-Industrial Complex (ADL, SPLC).  The former use the latter for spying and voyeuristic functions that the Constitution denies to them, and the former pay back the latter by dressing up in robes and bent crosses to create the fiction of &#8220;extreme right wing&#8221; activity so that the ADL and SPLC can send out fund raising letters.</p>
<p>Ironically, while the CAIR is complaining, the FBI has been hiring Muslims like hotcakes as agents or for other purposes.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is practicing &#8220;keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer&#8221; Hmmmm</p>
