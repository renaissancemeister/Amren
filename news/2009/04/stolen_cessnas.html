<h1><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7273710&amp;page=1">Stolen Cessna&rsquo;s Pilot Captured</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pierre Thomas and Luis Martinez, ABC News, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pilot who allegedly stole a Cessna plane from a Canadian flight school and was pursued for hours across the Midwest by fighter jets, was taken into custody after he landed on a Missouri highway late today and took off running, an FBI spokesman said.</p>
<p>The pilot landed the single engine Cessna 172 on U.S. Highway 60 in Ellsinore, Mo., at approximately 9:50 p.m. ET, and was caught by Missouri State Highway Patrol officers, FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said.</p>
<p>The pilot was identified as Yavuz Berke, formerly known as Adam Leon, a 31-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen who was born in Turkey, Kolko said.</p>
<p>The plane had been escorted by two F-16 fighter jets since shortly after it crossed into U.S. airspace from Canada, and the pilot did not respond to multiple requests that he establish communications with ground controllers.</p>
<p>Burke was apparently treated for depression last Friday and left his girlfriend a good-bye note, Canadian officials told the U.S. government. Berke&rsquo;s vehicle was left at the airport in Canada with the keys still in it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek said the F-16 pilots had made visual contact with the pilot and knew that the person flying the Cessna was aware that the F-16s were there. He was &#8220;unresponsive to their non-verbal directions and .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. not in contact with the FAA controllers,&#8221; Kucharek said.</p>
<p>FAA officials also said the Cessna&rsquo;s pilot did not respond to repeated efforts to hail him on all radio frequencies.</p>
<p>It was thought the fighter jets might have to shoot down the aircraft if it showed hostile intent, Kucharek told ABC News.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kucharek said it costs roughly $50,000 per hour/per jet to scramble F-16s. From the time the plane was initially intercepted over Lake Superior near the Michigan upper peninsula until it landed on the Missouri highway, it was followed by two F-16s for more than five hours  &mdash;  a likely tab of $500,000.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was flying for a while at 14,500 feet. Over 10,000 feet the air is quite thin and commercial planes would be pressurized, but the Cessna 172 is not. As a result, the pilot might have suffered from hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, which could have lead to confusion.</p>
<p>The plane later dropped its altitude to 3,700 feet, where there is more oxygen.</p>

			<p>What kind of flight school leaves the keys in the planes on the ramp? You get a nice big chewing out and wash an airplane for doing that here.</p>
<p>And on a side note, there is not LESS oxygen at higher altitudes as the article states. The air is 21% oxygen at all altitudes, but the particles are further apart at higher altitudes along with a lower air pressure.</p>

The Muslims now know we will do nothing if they send these airplanes at us. The next time, it will be thirty or forty, and they won&rsquo;t land on a highway.</p>

			<p>Reply to pilot_mkn:</p>
<p>You make some good points. The flight school should ALSO be severely punished for this oversight. I also feel security must have been poor for this guy to just show up and grab a plane out of the blue.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been at 14000 on a mountain in the Pacific Northwest.  The air&rsquo;s a little thin, but it&rsquo;s really not that bad.  Someone in his early 30s should not suffer from hypoxia.</p>

<p>Another fraudulent post by &#8220;Anonymous.&#8221;  Unless he landed as a passenger or pilot of a helicopter he would have felt some effect of the thinner air.</p>
<p>Most climbers in the Pacific Northwest carry oxygen, just in case.  Anyone who has climbed even a 10,000 ft mountain, as I did when I was 25, knows that with activity, such as &#8220;walking&#8221; up such as mountain, respiration goes up quite a bit for obvious reasons.  I was very fit too as I was in training from regular training with the national fencing squad.  It is also not unusual for a hiker to suffer polycythemia and develop even mild altitude sickness at elevations as low as 6,000 feet.  All of this with the requisite that the individual is working.  Hiking from 3,000&rsquo; to 7,000 feet in one day at the beginning of the season always brought out some symptoms in me - a fit young man in his mid to late 20s.</p>

			<p>The NYT reported in their &#8220;National Briefing&#8221; today Wednesday 8 April, that &#8220;&hellip;a Canadian flight student&hellip;&#8221; was being charged with stealing an aircraft. </p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip; </p>
<p>A Turkish Muslim who&rsquo;s been in Canada for one year and who changes his name while in Canada form a Muslim-sounding one to a more Anglicized name, steals a plane and crosses the border illegally with the intention of dying violently in said plane&hellip;. is simply a &#8220;Canadian flight student&#8221; to the New York Times. </p>

			<p>Lesson learned, if you hijack a plane and fly into American air space, no one will take the responsible of ordering you to be shot down. So go ahead and do what you like, your safe from being killed. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, this dingbat will be facing some prison time before deportation. <br>

<p>Want to bet? He&rsquo;ll get a good immigration lawyer, ask for political asylum and presto, we have another freeloader living here in America on taxpayers expense. </p>

			<p>At 9:50 ET (8:50 PM CT) it should be night in Missouri in early April. I suppose the 172 deadsticked from being out of fuel. On a highway at night? And they caught him running on foot at night?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something not quite right about this story. But crazier things have happened. I took a joy ride in a Piper Cherokee back in November from Montgomery County MD airport to Bay Bridge Airport (close to Annapolis). The entire flight was in the ultra high vigilance Administrative Air Defense Zone around DC. </p>
<p>Anyway on the outbound portion of the flight the air traffic controllers were having a devil of a time trying to get this thick accented foreign born pilot of another general aviation aircraft to obey their directives and do transponder resets. We all were amazed to listen to this over the radio.</p>

			<p>Since it landed in Ellsinore, Missouri, this has been an intense issue of interest in the media in Southeast Missouri.  The late development is that he was suicidal, but didn&rsquo;t have the courage to do it himself.  He wanted fighter pilots to shoot him down.</p>
