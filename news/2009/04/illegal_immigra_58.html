<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-na-immigrants15-2009apr15,0,1770439.story">Illegal Immigration Slowdown in California</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A study released Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center has documented a change in trend: After years of rapid growth, illegal immigration is slowing down in California, with the state&rsquo;s share of the nation&rsquo;s estimated 11.9 million undocumented migrants dropping to 22% from 42% in 1990, the study showed.</p>
<p>The state still has the largest concentration of illegal immigrants in the nation, with 2.7 million  &mdash;  a figure that has nearly doubled since 1990.</p>
<p>But, in a trend that began with California&rsquo;s recession in the 1990s, more migrants are bypassing the state for other areas of the country. The number of illegal immigrants outside the nation&rsquo;s six traditional &#8220;first stop&#8221; states of California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York has increased sevenfold, to nearly 5 million in 2008 from 700,000 in 1990, according to Jeffrey S. Passel, the study&rsquo;s coauthor and a Pew Center senior demographer.</p>
<p>The study, based on March 2008 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, comes amid renewed momentum for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include a legalization program for undocumented migrants. President Obama is expected to make a speech on immigration reform next month and launch public forums about the issue during the summer. Meanwhile, the nation&rsquo;s leading labor groups have reached a compromise about a guest worker program.</p>
<p>Passel said one of the study&rsquo;s most striking findings was the number of young families among the illegal immigrant population. Nearly half of the households headed by undocumented immigrants have young children, twice the rate of native-born households. And nearly three-fourths of their children were U.S.-born citizens.</p>
<p>The children of undocumented immigrants make up about 10% of California students in kindergarten through 12th grade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the slowdown in illegal immigration was welcome news  &mdash;  but not for the right reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s slowing down because the economy has tanked, not because the state is doing much to stop it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What you&rsquo;d like to see is illegal immigration decline because we have rational policies in place that make it clear to people that you&rsquo;re not going to benefit by coming to the U.S. or California illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, co-written by D&rsquo;Vera Cohn, a Pew Research Center senior writer, found that three-quarters of illegal immigrants are Latino, mostly from Mexico. On average, they tend to work in low-skilled jobs such as farming and construction, earn markedly less than the median national income and have lower educational levels than U.S.-born residents.</p>
<p>For instance, 47% of illegal immigrant adults ages 25-64 have less than a high school education compared with 8% for U.S.-born residents. The immigrants&rsquo; 2007 median household income was $36,000, compared with $50,000 for the U.S.-born, and they did not attain markedly higher incomes the longer they lived in the United States, unlike legal immigrants, the study found.</p>

			<p>Boo-hoo! This is truly sad news for those of us in CA. For those of you in other states, prepare for a real multicultural experience! You&rsquo;ll be treated to loud mariachi music every weekend in the park. Ladies, you&rsquo;re about to get a lot of attention from men! When you hear, &#8220;Sss&hellip;sss&hellip;sss,&#8221; don&rsquo;t be alarmed. It&rsquo;s just a well-meaning guy admiring you. Gentlemen, you won&rsquo;t be ignored either. You&rsquo;ll get plenty of resentful stares, what we call mad-dogging here in L.A. It should remind you how lucky you are to have such privilege. Kids, you won&rsquo;t have to work as hard in school, because the teachers are going to have to slow the curriculum waaay down and focus all their attention on the students who don&rsquo;t read or write English well. School will be a piece of cake for you now. Sweet! Drivers, if you are ever rear-ended, don&rsquo;t worry about getting out of your car to exchange insurance information, because the other party will drive away! But how could we have a truly multicultural experience without the food? The tamale vendor will roll through the neighborhood selling her wares from a stolen shopping cart. You are in for a real treat. Oh, almost forgot&hellip;taxpayers, you&rsquo;ll get to provide all those &#8220;free&#8221; services for other people&rsquo;s kids. That should give you a real sense of altruism. All that AND the California sunshine. We are truly blessed.</p>

<p>Please, give me a break. California alone probably has about 11.9 million illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>I live in Texas and we experience the same thing, so does most of the Southwest and the South. The illegals need to go to some of these northern, midwestern and pacific northwest states. Let New England or Iowa or Minnesota get some of this &#8220;diversity.&#8221; That&rsquo;s when the real screaming will begin. </p>

			<p>You bet they are.  Just like the Allies moved off the beaches of Normandy and spread out into France and then Germany.  It&rsquo;s a slow-motion invasion.  They won&rsquo;t just stay on the beachhead  &mdash;  they&rsquo;ll cover every square mile of the US, just like they are in Mexico.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Go there like I have.  Every place in Mexico that is inhabitable, has people living there.  Just a horrible, dirty, overcrowded country.  Just like we&rsquo;re becoming.  </p>

			<p>Well duh. CA is now part of Mexico so if you want to migrate to the USA you have to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>We in Minnesota have PLENTY of this diversity.  Not to mention the large Somali and Hmong populations that make sure our taxes keep going up. We&rsquo;ll trade you. </p>

<p>Yes, I have relatives in TX, and I hear you. Of course, I meant my post about what we experience in CA very tongue-in-cheek, and that was my point exactly: when other states are as overrun as ours are, there will have to be some serious attention paid to this matter.  </p>

<p>Washtington State is well along in with its plan to take in these wanderers as well as Black refugees from Southern California.  In Portland, OR they are still looking for a street to name after Chavez, but they have the obligatory MLK and Rosa Parks already.  Neighborhoods that used to never have a strange incident are being shocked, one by one by shootings, rapes or robberies.  So I can report that all is well and the American Dream rolls on!</p>
