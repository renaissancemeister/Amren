<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7969109.stm">South Africa&rsquo;s Hi-Tech Healer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lucy Fleming, BBC News, March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swishing a wildebeest tail and wearing a fez-like hat adorned with goat&rsquo;s gall bladders, Amanda Gcabashe seems an unlikely figure for a web-savvy African healer.</p>
<p>But from her plush home in Johannesburg&rsquo;s northern suburbs, she is the face of a modern sangoma, as a traditional healer is known in South Africa.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old former South African business executive has set up a website to try to debunk the myths and secrets surrounding healers and their powers.</p>
<p>Her practice in the middle-class suburbs has attracted people from across the racial divides  &mdash;  part of her aim to bring sangomas, who tend to be a hidden part of rural and township life, out into the open and to address their bad image.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you read media reports or any kind of publicity around an African healer, it&rsquo;s always in the negative and for me that was the starting point,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The recent killing of albino people in Tanzania and Burundi for get-rich quick potions are a case in point.</p>
<p><b>Interpreting dreams</b></p>
<p>South Africa too has experienced grisly killings for body parts used in traditional cures  &mdash;  so called &#8220;muti murders&#8221;  &mdash;  which, Ms Gcabashe says, all sangomas should condemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to stand up and have our voices heard: We don&rsquo;t kill people and we don&rsquo;t subscribe to killing people. We all get lumped together as healers when there are healers and there are those who use their medicines and abilities for other kinds of things,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m from a corporate background. I realised the power of the internet to get information out there and to start a conversation and a dialogue about what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glossary of terms on the website describes a sangoma as &#8220;one who has the inborn ability to decipher the language of amadlozi [ancestors] including the interpreting of dreams&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe our ancestors give us guidance,&#8221; says Ms Gcabashe, who became a traditional healer eight and half years ago.</p>
<p><b>Frequently asked questions</b></p>
<p>As a child, her family never used traditional healers and it was in her twenties that she found her calling  &mdash;  prompted in part by visions of herself dressed in the white and red regalia of a sangoma.</p>
<p>Now her online mission is to show that sangomas are relevant in the 21st Century, much like counsellors, and should be taken seriously along with other forms of complementary therapies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When someone comes to see a sangoma you basically discuss whatever problem they are having and try and offer solutions  &mdash;  from a spiritual point of view  &mdash;  and give them tools that they can use to make their lives easier or help them health wise,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t promise instant riches, a fulfilled life is what we try and achieve for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>People are not able to book appointments on her website  &mdash;  www.mphutungwane.co.za  &mdash;  but there is a query form.</p>
<p>She answers emails every day  &mdash;  varying from how to deal with a miscarriage traditionally to curious inquires from as far a field as France  &mdash;  so much so that she is now setting up a &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; section.</p>
<p>The website also advises first-timers and people trying to reconnect with their cultural roots about what to expect when consulting a sangoma  &mdash;  and how to behave.</p>
<p>Women should not wear trousers, shoes should be removed and mobile phones turned off.</p>
<p>And while all consultations take place on a grass mat, not all sangomas throw bones to communicate with the ancestral world.</p>
<p><b>Reference book</b></p>
<p>Ms Gcabashe says she speaks directly to her ancestors  &mdash;  something she learnt to do during her nine-month initiation.</p>
<p>For my consultation, I sat on the floor as she stood sideways before me, flicking her fly whisk as she addressed her ancestors in Zulu.</p>
<p>After some minutes she said my mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s grandmother  &mdash;  an elderly Irish lady, bent over double  &mdash;  had hobbled forward to give advice.</p>
<p>As nothing is known about my Irish grandmother&rsquo;s family, I was surprised at her appearance on the scene  &mdash;  it even felt like an impudent intrusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;She asks that you should light a candle for her later,&#8221; Ms Gcabashe said.</p>
<p>I softened and we proceeded  &mdash;  after one or two false starts  &mdash;  to discuss my career, affairs of the heart and ended with some health advice.</p>
<p>In my case, no medication was prescribed  &mdash;  and not all sangomas, who say they can communicate with the spirit world, are able to dispense medicines.</p>
<p>This is done by inyangas  &mdash;  practitioners trained to collect and prepare herbal cures.</p>
<p>Ms Gcabashe is an inyanga too and has ambitions to open an African healing centre.</p>
<p>Frustrated with the lack of reference books on African medicine, she also hopes her website will be a start towards compiling such information.</p>
<p><b>Fighting Aids</b></p>
<p>She believes sangomas have an important role to play in fighting HIV/Aids  &mdash;  by far South Africa&rsquo;s biggest health issue  &mdash;  especially addressing the stigma of HIV and making people understand that it is manageable if treated as a life-long condition.</p>
<p>But she disputes the controversial claim by a former South African health minister that remedies such as eating African potatoes can combat HIV.</p>
<p>She says traditional medicines can be used along with Western medicine in the treatment of HIV/Aids  &mdash;  by increasing appetite and strengthening the immune system.</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone&rsquo;s on ARVs [anti-retrovirals] I never say: &#8216;Throw them away and take my medicine.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The day after our interview I received a call from the taxi driver who had delivered me to the appointment in the upmarket gated estate  &mdash;  agog to hear how much &#8220;the sangoma in the suburbs&#8221; had charged.</p>
<p>In the townships, he said, a visit to a sangoma costs about 50 rand (Â£4), cheaper than a visit to the doctor.</p>
<p>Ms Gcabashe&rsquo;s fee is 200 rand for an hour-and-a-half session.</p>
<p>But with an average of five clients a week and daily queries on her website which do not necessarily translate into physical consultations, it is not a lucrative business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s my gift and I can&rsquo;t run away from it,&#8221; she says, adding that she is a consultant on traditional customs, such as weddings, to supplement her income.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re all very Westernised but when we come to get married, we want to do the traditional thing.&#8221;<br>

We should promote and encourage believers in &#8216;traditional healers&rsquo; too seek treatment from these practitioners. We can be be assured they receive the treatments appropriate to their levels of reasoning.</p>

			<p>These people, like America&rsquo;s Johathan Edwards, are all quite capable of the magician&rsquo;s art of &#8220;cold reading&#8221; whereby you can get a stupendous amount of information from someone from their appearance and the way they answer questions (including facial expressions and even the way they move their eyes and hands). </p>
<p>However, I am all for native peoples practicing THEIR OWN religions and spiritual practices&hellip; NOT OURS&hellip; in their own lands.</p>
<p>Let us engage in OUR OWN SPIRITUALITY, AS BEFITS OUR PEOPLE. </p>
<p>So &hellip; you go, girl.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the U.S. government can find a way for this woman to come to America and accept medicare/medicaid payments and all forms of credit cards.</p>
