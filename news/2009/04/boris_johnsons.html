<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/apr/15/boris-johnson-illegal-immigrant-amnesty">Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Backing Boosts Illegal Immigrant Amnesty Campaign</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hélène Mulholland, Guardian (London), April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A London rally demanding an amnesty for illegal immigrants living in the UK will be staged during May bank holiday after receiving backing from Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>Strangers into Citizens, a three-year national campaign by an umbrella group of civic bodies, has seized on the Tory London mayor&rsquo;s support for an &#8220;earned amnesty&#8221; for illegal immigrants who have been living in the city for several years.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the campaign said Johnson was not expected to attend the event, which will take place in Trafalgar Square, but added that his support for the cause had helped raise its public profile.</p>
<p>The broad-based campaign is being staged by the country&rsquo;s largest alliance of civic institutions, the Citizen Organising Foundation, which includes London Citizens and Birmingham Citizens.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the decision to stage a rally had been triggered by concern that the recent rows over &#8220;British jobs for British workers&#8221; and the recession had left migrants particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are already vulnerable to exploitation might more vulnerable,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Johnson first voiced his support for the idea of an earned amnesty during the mayoral election last April, despite opposition from both the Labour government and the Conservative party.</p>
<p>The mayor commissioned a study, conducted by the London School of Economics earlier this year.</p>
<p>Its interim findings suggested that the number of &#8220;irregular residents&#8221; and their children in Britain at the end of 2007 was in the range of 525,000 to 950,000, with a central estimate of 725,000.</p>
<p>This compared with a Home Office estimate, based on the 2001 census, of between 310,000 and 570,000, with a central estimate of 430,000.</p>
<p>The study said there were a further 175,000 &#8220;quasi-legal&#8221; migrants whose right to remain depended on the future determination of their migration status.</p>
<p>The LSE research found that between 57% and 75% of irregular residents in Britain live in London.</p>
<p>Johnson has argued that an earned amnesty in the capital would allow people currently in the city illegally to integrate and contribute more fully to society.</p>
<p>The Strangers into Citizens campaign wants immigrants across the UK who have been in the country for four or more years to be admitted to a two-year pathway to full legal rights  &mdash;  &#8220;leave to remain&#8221;  &mdash;  during which they would work legally and demonstrate their contribution to UK economy and society.</p>
<p>After that two-year period, subject to knowledge of English and employer and community references, they would be granted permanent leave to remain.<br>

			<p>Just wait until after the Euro elections when the BNP takes one or more seats.</p>
<p>Labour and possibly the Libdems will be slobbering over amnesty.  They need more minority votes to shore up their rapidly shrinking white voter base.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s just another traitor to Britain.  Of course, when 60% - or more - of the population of London is non-white, and many of those non-whites know or are related to an illegal, it doesn&rsquo;t take much thinking to understand Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;sellout&#8221; support.  People like him would sell their first born for the same reason, if they could get away with it.<br>

			<p>The conservative party in the U.K. and the Republican party of the U.S.A are hardly any different from the left-wing parties in these nations. The Conservatives (and republicans) ignore White citizens in these countries in favour of the small number of darkies. But after all this, the darkies always end up supporting the  Labour party or the Democrats. Even though the Conservatives are more preferable than the Labour to run the country, Britain has only one sane option, the British Nationalist Party.</p>

			<p>Another pertinent example of how so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are worthless to any struggle for national or racial self-determination. They will always place excessive Individualist self-interest and the pursuit of profits at any price over the good of the nation or racial community. Republican or Tory, &#8220;Gaullist&#8221; or &#8220;Christian Democrat,&#8221; these reactionaries have been utterly incompetent and worthless in doing anything to deter the social, political, economic, and demographic catastrophe presently engulfing the remnants of Western Civilization!</p>

			<p>It really hardly matters anymore.  For Britain to survive several groups of immigrants need to be rounded up and deported.  Since this will never happen expect massive riots and civil war PLUS higher taxes to pay for the insanity of importing pakistanis to live on welfare just so labour can stay in power.</p>

			<p>Many you have probably already met Boris Johnson, though you might not recall. He was the tow-headed BUFFOON who accepted the Olympic flag from the Chinese at the end of the 2008 Olympics. You might also remember the embarrassingly lame (and excruciatingly PC) entrance of the double-decker green monstrosity that was showing us what kind of Olympics we can expect in London 3 1/2 years from now. The whole world was laughing.</p>

			<p>I find it so difficult to wrap my head around how people can come up with some of these idiotic, self-defeating ideas. Come over illegally, stay under the radar for a few years, and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a citizenship - your reward for dodging around the laws and measures in place and beating the system (and the incredible sums of money spent to support these) that is supposed to be there to stop the very thing you did in the first place. </p>
<p>Unfathomably stupid. </p>
