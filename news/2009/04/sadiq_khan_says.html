<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/apr/12/foreign-affairs-pakistan-drone-raids">Sadiq Khan Says US Foreign Policy on Pakistan is Damaging Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Doward and Rajeev Syal, Observer (London), April 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The UK must distance itself from American foreign policy if Pakistani youths are to be prevented from growing up hating Britain, according to the government&rsquo;s social cohesion minister.</p>
<p>The comments by Sadiq Khan, who has just returned from a fact-finding trip to Pakistan, follow the arrests of 12 men  &mdash;  10 of whom were Pakistani nationals  &mdash;  in the north-west of England last week on suspicion of planning a terror attack. They are likely to be given short shrift from Number 10, which has been keen to ally itself to the Obama administration. Earlier this month Gordon Brown stressed the two allies were united in their fight against terrorism in Pakistan.</p>
<p>But Khan, London&rsquo;s first Muslim MP, said the UK must differentiate itself from the US after attending meetings at universities in Pakistan. &#8220;I listened to the anger and pain over the challenges that young people growing up in Pakistan face, including the anger and frustration over US drone attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The attacks by unmanned US drones have provoked fury in Pakistan, where scores of militants have been killed in the country&rsquo;s remote border regions, along with innocent civilians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anger and frustration at the drone attacks was huge,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;The view they [the students] had was that the UK was somehow responsible for this. They haven&rsquo;t understood this was purely a US matter. They lumped us together with the US, which to me is a poison. It demonstrates to me we have a big problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khan, whose parents are from Pakistan, suggested the UK should look to reach out to disaffected Muslim youths by emphasising the close links between the two countries. &#8220;Much of the Pakistani population doesn&rsquo;t realise the good we are doing,&#8221; Khan said: the UK is to double aid to Pakistan to £180m by 2011.</p>
<p>Crucial to winning hearts and minds, Khan said, was dismantling the perception that the US and the UK were one and the same over foreign policy. Acknowledging the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq had mobilised Muslim opinion against the UK, Khan said: &#8220;Because of things that happened in 2003, there is an uphill battle. We need better to explain that there has been a distinct change in UK foreign policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, this month the last troops will come home from Iraq: that&rsquo;s very different from the US. The drone attacks are US, not UK; our development policy doesn&rsquo;t have the strings that come with US aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s comments come as ministers seek to increase the numbers of security officials in Pakistan to help in vetting those applying for visas to Britain. At present there are fewer than 10 security service officers assessing the backgrounds of more than 20,000 applications a year. &#8220;At present, we are reliant on a small number of officials who do the ground work; that is reliant on the Pakistani government giving us what it knows. That should improve in the near future, and can be done with the co-operation of Pakistan,&#8221; a Home Office source said.</p>
<p>Government figures show that 42,292 student visas were issued to Pakistanis between April 2004 and April 2008.<br>

			<p>He&rsquo;s trying to drive a wedge between two white Western countries, the U.S. and Britain.  He&rsquo;s using threats of violence if the U.K. doesn&rsquo;t meet their demands.  </p>
<p>The timetable for repatriation of Pakistanis back to their homeland is overdue.  Pakistanis cannot colonize England; the people are incompatible. The English have the moral right and duty to take back their country.</p>

			<p>Well, the problem with Pakistanis not living harmoniously in the UK really has to do with the fact that they are Muslims and reject Western culture. It&rsquo;s the same reason that Bangladeshis cause problems in the UK.</p>
<p>Though, I do have to back up on the issue of the drone attacks as I agree that it was definitely wrong. First off, it&rsquo;s incredibly cowardly to use unmanned vehicles to kill anyone. I know some people say that winning is all that war is all about, but to lose your honor in the process is not worth it. It&rsquo;s hard for many Americans to imagine and comprehend the way that people in third world countries feel when they come up against us, but try to imagine the aliens in the movie, &#8220;Independence Day&#8221;. That&rsquo;s what we are to these people.</p>

<p>First, Peter K, I would ask if you have been in Combat. If you have, then this is a ludicrous statement. Second, I would ask, have you ever been to these countries, Paki, India, Philippines and and the Middle East? YES, the problems from these people (especially Pakis) is that they are muslims.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Britain&rsquo;s immigration policies undermining the &ldquo;special relationship.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s special with any relationship where the religious fanatics want to blow up native citizens?</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s lefties will get a view of this relationship up close and personal when the country keeps losing jobs, and revenue drops to serious lows. </p>

			<p>Pakistani muslim immigration to Britain is the worst thing ever to happen to Britain. The British would have been better off if they had lost the war with Germany.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;But Pakistan has 173 million people and 100 nuclear weapons, an army which is bigger than the American army,</p>
<p>The only thing that keeps the Pakis in line and their nuke weapons neutralized is INDIA! The idea of MAD keeps them civil (after a fashion) for now, but it won&rsquo;t last. The Pakis are not afraid of the U.S. because they know our politicians will crumble for any number of reasons, to political or financial pressures or bribes. The Saudis already know our Congress and Senate can be bought and then sub-let to other muslim countries:)</p>
