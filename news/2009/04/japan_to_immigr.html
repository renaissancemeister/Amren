<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s offer to minority communities in need has spawned the ire of those whom it intends to help. It is one thing to be laid off in an economic crisis. It is quite another to be unemployed and to feel unwanted by the country where you&rsquo;ve settled. That&rsquo;s how Freitas and other Brazilians feel since the Japanese government started the program to pay $3,000 to each jobless foreigner of Japanese descent (called Nikkei) and $2,000 to each family member to return to their country of origin. The money isn&rsquo;t the problem, the Brazilians say; it&rsquo;s the fact that they will not be allowed to return until economic and employment conditions improve  &mdash;  whenever that may be. &#8220;When Nikkei go back and can&rsquo;t return, for us that&rsquo;s discrimination,&#8221; says Freitas, who has lived in Japan with his family for 12 years. </p>
<p>With Japan&rsquo;s unemployment rate on the rise  &mdash;  it reached a three-year high of 4.4% in February  &mdash;  the government is frantic to find solutions to stanch the flow of job losses and to help the unemployed. The virtual collapse of Japan&rsquo;s export-driven economy, in which exports have nearly halved compared to the first two months of last year, has forced manufacturers to cut production. Temporary and contract workers at automotive and electronics companies have been hit especially hard. Hamamatsu has 18,000 Brazilian residents, about 5% of the total in Japan, and is home to the nation&rsquo;s largest Brazilian community. After immigration laws relaxed in 1990, making it easier for foreigners to live and work in Japan, Brazilians have grown to be the country&rsquo;s third largest minority, after Koreans and Chinese. But as jobs grow scarce and money runs out, some Nikkei ironically now face the same tough decision their Japanese relatives did 100 years ago, when they migrated to Brazil. </p>
<p>Japan can scarcely afford to lose part of its labor force, or close itself off further to foreigners. Japan, with its aging population that is projected to shrink by one-third over the next 50 years, needs all the workers it can get. The U.N. has projected that the nation will need 17 million immigrants by 2050 to maintain a productive economy. But immigration laws remain strict, and foreign-born workers make up only 1.7% of the total population. Brazilians feel particularly hard done by. &#8220;The reaction from the Brazilian community is very hot,&#8221; says a Brazilian Embassy official. The embassy has asked Japan&rsquo;s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to &#8220;ease the conditions&#8221; of reentry for Brazilians who accept the money. (Paradoxically, the Japanese government had recently stepped up efforts to help Brazilian residents, with programs such as Japanese-language training and job-counseling.) This particular solution to unemployment, however, is perceived as a misguided gift. &#8220;Maybe there were good intentions, but the offer was presented in the worst way possible,&#8221; says the Brazilian official. The program applies to Brazilians who have long-term Nikkei visas, but restricts their right  &mdash;  and that of their family members  &mdash;  to reentry until jobs are available in Japan. The terms are vague and will probably stay that way. Tatsushi Nagasawa, a Japanese health ministry official says it&rsquo;s not possible to know when those who accept the money will be allowed back into Japan, though the conditions for reentry for highly skilled positions might be relaxed. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And if Nikkei Brazilians, Peruvians and others who have lost their jobs go home, what will Japan do? Last week, Prime Minister Taro Aso unveiled a long-term growth strategy to create millions of jobs and add $1.2 trillion to GDP by 2020. But the discussion of immigration reform is notoriously absent in Japan, and reaching a sensible policy for foreign workers has hardly got under way. Encouraging those foreigners who would actually like to stay in Japan to leave seems a funny place to start. <br>

			<p>Unemployment is pretty bad in our country. I, myself, am looking for a job. It would be nice if our government had the same prudence as the Japanese government and took action to repatriate legal Mexicans so that Americans, such as myself, can have jobs. Putting an end to mass third-world immigration would be efficient, too.</p>

<p>I would seem that we have heard this old song from the U.N, before. I wonder if the Japanese are going to want all of those 17 million &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to be black muslims!! another civilized country down the multi-cult sewer. Wish we in the U.S. could get off so cheap as to pay all of our immigrants and blacks $3000 to get out and not come back, WoooooHoooo.</p>

<p>You got to admit, this is a little weird, with these supposed &#8220;Brazilians&#8221; actually being racially Japanese and Asian, and are being treated like their Mexican Mestizos or Dominican Mulattos or something.</p>
<p>Japan is simply too extreme in this respect, and do not deserve any admiration, or &#8216;props&rsquo;, on this one.</p>

			<p>Here we go again with the old &#8220;aging population&#8221; canard. They use this just about every time they run a &#8220;poor immigrant&#8221; story, no matter what country they are talking about. Apparently, to leftists, civilization is on the verge of extinction and allowing hordes of third-worlders into your country is the only way to stop it! </p>

			<p><i>But the discussion of immigration reform is notoriously absent in Japan, and reaching a sensible policy for foreign workers has hardly got under way. Encouraging those foreigners who would actually like to stay in Japan to leave seems a funny place to start.</i><p>Japan already has a sensible policy for foreign workers: they leave Japan and go home when the work is done.  Japan wants to stay Japanese.  You have a problem with that?  I certainly don&rsquo;t.<p>I wish white people had the healthy ethnic and racial consciousness I see so often in Asians.  They take pride in their ancestry, culture, languages, civilization, and while they often may find much to admire in other civilizations (especially Western civilization - it always amuses me when I see Westerners who are confidently criticizing the West shocked when Asians contradict them and actually defend the West!), they do not want to trade their culture and civilization in for another, or to amalgamate it so much with a different one that it is no longer recognizable.  <br>

			<p>Good to see atleast one country is displaying common sense in these crazy multi cult times.</p>
<p>If things continue as they are, down the dark path the west as descended into, it may very well be that only countries, such as Japan, will be left as first world societies. Say what you will about our Yellow cousins, they&rsquo;re practicing a policy that will solidify their genes into the future.</p>
<p>We need one</p>

<a href="/ar/2007/08/index.html#cover" rel="nofollow">/ar/2007/08/index.html#cover</a></p>
<p>And why does this &#8220;Coco Masters&#8221; care so much about Japanese or their immigration policy? Why be so generous to even suggest rewarding this very wicked Japanese society with more precious immigrants? Can&rsquo;t Japanese loss be America&rsquo;s gain in a world competing for third world immigrants? No, fewer immigrants to Japan should be Japan&rsquo;s punishment. Don&rsquo;t tell them to get smart.</p>

			<p>The funny thing is that these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; spoken of are actually ethnic Japanese themselves   &mdash;   not just East Asians like the Chinese and Koreans, but Japanese.  That is the very reason they were invited back in the first place.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite an eye-opener on the relative situations of Japan and the USA, I suppose   &mdash;   even Japan&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221; are Japanese!  Meanwhile we categorize mestizos and Arabs as &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>Japan can scarcely afford to lose part of its labor force, or close itself off further to foreigners. Japan, with its aging population that is projected to shrink by one-third over the next 50 years, needs all the workers it can get. </i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious:<br>
Not to show up the &#8220;Immigration Ponzi Scheme&#8221; (in the West and Japan) for the stack of cards it is, what do these &#8220;economists&#8221; propose to do when even the birth-rates of the immigrants, including their native spouses, start to decline? Who will shore up <i>that</i> &#8220;ageing demographic&#8221;?<br>
Papua New Guineans? Indian peasants? Pygmies?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d just like the U.N. to note that - while &#8220;the West&#8221; (suicidally it seems) decided to import warm bodies to keep up the arms race of never-ending economic growth, Japan has seen incredible developments in robotics these past few decades.</p>
<p><i>The U.N. has projected that the nation will need 17 million immigrants by 2050 to maintain a productive economy</i></p>
<p>How many more roads, houses etc must be built? How many miles of the remaining areas of nature will be gobbled up to support an ever-increasing population? How much extra pollution will be created by said population?</p>
<p>For an organisation so concerned with the environment, it&rsquo;s a shame that they&rsquo;re blinded to the effects of continual immigration on the environment.</p>
<p>But anyway, it&rsquo;s the usual sob-story of &#8220;<i>immigrants are hard done by because the natives may actually <b>want their jobs</b> now!</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p>No bias here.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Mr. Taylor speak and have been impressed with this organization, yet it seems like 50-60% of the articles posted here are from a perspective such as this one (instead of praising the Japanese for saving their culture, it denigrates their efforts).

<p>How darkly and laughably ironic, this article is!</p>
<p>The Japanese remain the one Asian people, that the white race has the most to learn from. This is particularly true in Europe, but does extend also to: the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zeeland, Argentina, etc. </p>
<p>In the face of UN and international media incredulity, they select to remove Nikkei immigrants (who are genetically, if not completely culturally Japanese, mind you) from their society in favor of their native population for economic considerations. There is little to no talk of &ldquo;cherishing&rdquo; them for the &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; diversity they bring to Japan, nor any romanticism of what is &ldquo;owed&rdquo; to these foreign born &ldquo;stepsiblings&rdquo; or &ldquo;cousins.&rdquo; </p>
<p>While such inspired nationalism might provoke horrified &ldquo;bewilderment&rdquo; in multiculturalists the whole world over, it gives me a sense of bemused and hopeful glee.</p>
<p>If they can do it, so can we!</p>
<p>Yes we can, indeed!!!<br>

			<p>The Japanese never cease to impress me. Their actions always have such a high degree of logic to it, not weighed under by any sort of feel good argument. For all the multicultural deconstructionist arguments against western culture, let them try and put forward the argument the japanese have no inherent culture. In every conceivable field that falls within a multicults definition of culture they have made their own unique and distinct way of doing things. I enjoy bringing up the Japanese example when debating issues of multiculturalism, and I encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>I am visiting Japan later this year for the reason of meeting Japanese people and experiencing their culture. I am not going there to meet brazilians or experience brazilian culture, just as I have no intentions of going to Brazil to experience Japanese culture.</p>

			<p>Maybe I&rsquo;d actually respect Japan if they practiced what they preached. They certainly don&rsquo;t have a problem immigrating to white countries. Not to mention the number of Japanese women who marry socially inept Asiaphiles. Not that I want the genes of these pathetic &#8220;men&#8221; to pollute the white race, but it does disturb me when they spawn a bunch of confused Eurasians, who almost always grow up hostile to whites. (Gee, just like most mixed kids.)</p>
<p>Just like other non-whites, the Japanese would scream like children if we told them, &#8220;White countries for whites only.&#8221;</p>

<p>The UN needs to stuff a sock in it. By 2050 not only will Japan have a productive economy, the nations  of much of the UN will not be. These airheads are so enamored with their multicult philosophy they dont see the doom in their own near futures.</p>
<p>In some respects, i cant wait. Cant wait to see them quiet up for good when they see thier countries have descended into chaos through the very inane immigrant policies they were so in love with. To me, simply knowing that one of these pompous lefty high horses could be stricken with the heavy guilt of being the ones behind their own complete eradication would soothe me. But a lefty would never know reality without casting blame elsewhere, so such is a lost cause. </p>

			<p>Confused poster- the articles posted here relate to race in the news. Mr. Taylor does an excellent job of finding these articles and linking them on his site. In this respect he is simply the facilitator of our discussion points. He makes no opinions and lets the articles speak for themselves. This is why only some of the articles look at whites favorably, due to the inherent media basis against our culture.<br>

			<p>I applaud the Japanese for their clear thinking and compassion.  The nikkei have no &#8220;right&#8221; to be in Japan at all, and the Japanese people would be fully within their rights to expel them peremptorily if they so chose.  To pay them a small stipend is more than the nikkei have a right to expect.</p>
<p>As for the UN believing that Japan needs millions of additional immigrants, they once again fail to consider the benefits of a high-tech society.  150 years ago, American farmers needed hundreds of laborers to harvest their wheat crops.  Following the invention and refinement of the combine, that same amount of work can be done faster and more effectively by a handful of people using technology to their advantage.</p>
<p>The Japanese are showing great wisdom.  By convincing foreigners to leave they will retain the Japanese nature of their society, while using their own resources to invest in the technological infrastructure they need to make their nation prosper with fewer workers.</p>

			<p>Some posters seem shocked that Japan would want to get rid of the Brazilians with Japanese ancestry, but you need to understand that many of these immigrants are barley Japanese any more. Many of the families left as long as 100 years ago and don&rsquo;t speak Japanese or understand Japanese culture. Many of them are mixed. The Japanese tried a noble experiment by trying to allow those that they felt belonged in Japan to come back, but what they found out was that they didn&rsquo;t belong. They didn&rsquo;t fit in and became a burden to the Japanese, bringing a foreign culture and language to Japan.  There&rsquo;s more to being Japanese than having a Japanese last name.</p>

			<p>Aside from the self-evident fact that Congolese and Norwiegians are NOT interchangebale (can I got to jail for saying this??):</p>
<p>Not long ago (when I was young), the US had a population ca 200 million, but no one ever said that &#8220;we were missing 120 million people, without them we can&rsquo;t possibly have a productive economy!!&#8221; </p>
<p>This insane mantra should be examined closely, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>A leaner, smarter, healthier, smaller population means higher productivity, lower crime, less welfare, less pollution, lower housing prices, unclogged freeways, uncrowded beaches and natural areas, and a seat on the commuter rail. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give it a try!</p>

			<p>Since the people referred to as &#8220;Nikkei&#8221; are ethnically Japanese, to say that Brazil is the right place for them is equivalent to saying that the ethnic Chinese colonies from San Francisco to Vancouver are right where they belong and must remain there.  </p>
<p>Same for the ethnically African, so many of whom have lived in America for more generations than those Japanese did in Brazil.</p>
<p>This action is one of Japanese abusing other Japanese, as well as the country they intend to send these Japanese &#8220;back&#8221; to.  It makes no sense from a racial perspective, and it is stunning to see how quick so many here are to fawn over the supposed wisdom of the Japanese government, apparently without knowing very much about either it or the issues involved.   This is just another government pretending to do something good and effective, when in truth it is neither. It is a typical politician&rsquo;s distraction maneuver.  Well, it may be effective as a distraction, but it won&rsquo;t change the economy. </p>
<p>The Japanese example is not necessarily the best argument against multiculturalism, since nearly everything in Japanese culture originated in other cultures.  They do guard their racial stock pretty well, but even their vaunted racial purity has been found to be 70 to 80 percent common with Korea. <br>
The Japanese DNA researcher who discovered that got bullets in his window, so you may not want to bring that up when you visit.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you, Zarathustra, that if will you spend some time in Japan &amp; if you  ask them about their government, you will discover plenty of illogic &amp; corruption.  </p>
<p>Still, it is indeed a very nice place in the main, and whatever the depth of learning you experience (or lack thereof; depends on the time you will spend &amp; your willingness to be disabused of illusion), you will almost certainly have a wonderful time.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great place to visit, and thanks to the American navy (not counting the criminal element that occasionally does so much to inflame Japanese resentment), they are very friendly towards visitors (you would not have wanted to visit Japan before the U.S. Navy got there).  It is clean, interesting, and much safer than a safari in Zimbabwe or S.A., or Detroit or L.A.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;the U.N. says Japan will &#8220;need&#8221; 17 million immigrants by 2050&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Note how it is THE U.N. AND NOT JAPAN that keeps saying this. You should bare in mind that the U.N. is made up heavily of third-worlders who wnat to get into modern countries. Jared Taylor wrote an article about this for VDARE.Com on October 29 2003.</p>

			<p>  Shouldn&rsquo;t immigration be linked to unemployment? If indigenous Japanese are unemployed and looked for work, who should be considered for employment: native Japanese or immigrants? In Japan the answer would be natives; unfortunately, in America the answer would often be recent immigrants.</p>

Right. They should be the last to go, they should get started on their other foreign communities first. </p>
<p>What a luxury they have, to be able to pick and choose who they want to get rid of like that, and still be dealing with large groups of people of their own blood. </p>
<p>Could be one of the next big debates to really heat up in western nations as the unemployment figures rise - who we start shipping off first. There are going to be fireworks there, one would imagine.</p>

The Japanese never cease to impress me. Their actions always have such a high degree of logic to it, not weighed under by any sort of feel good argument. For all the multicultural deconstructionist arguments against western culture, let them try and put forward the argument the japanese have no inherent culture. In every conceivable field that falls within a multicults definition of culture they have made their own unique and distinct way of doing things. I enjoy bringing up the Japanese example when debating issues of multiculturalism, and I encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>I am visiting Japan later this year for the reason of meeting Japanese people and experiencing their culture. I am not going there to meet brazilians or experience brazilian culture, just as I have no intentions of going to Brazil to experience Japanese culture.</p>

<p>I have been living in Japan for about 10 years and I am a minority and it seems to me that the people on this panel haven&rsquo;t the slightest clue as to how Japan works and the reasons they do what they do. Japan to an extent is at odds with its culture and its position and standing in the world. While the &#8220;older&#8221; generation are sometimes somewhat apprehensive shy towards foreigners, but the Japanese know that with a growing China and India around the corner and with an ever growing aging population and more women opting out of marriage, the country &#8220;has&#8221; to outsource in order to stay competitive and in the game.<br>
This is a battle slowly that we are winning.  Japan doesn&rsquo;t need to be like the west or follow the west, but this is 2009, the world has gotten a lot closer and it can&rsquo;t be undone, mixed children are becoming quite normal as on TV there are a few famous minorities as well as in the music industry and are hugely popular.<br>
Do I think that Japan should change their culture, of course not, but the fact remains, this country is in a serious crisis already they getting people from South East asia, Korea, China make up the largest minority in Japan, Africans, Pakistani&rsquo;s etc.<br>
Yes, they have their own way of doing things, but in the long run, it is harming them and as a whole this nation is on a downward spiral. There was an article in &#8220;Time magazine&#8221; a few years ago and the title was &#8220;Why Japan has no friends&#8221; interesting read, but multiculturalism is growing and like it or not, the Japanese have to deal with it.</p>

I am certain that Japan only agreed to admit these people in the first place on the clear understanding that these foreigners&rsquo; presence in Japan was to be only TEMPORARY. I&rsquo;m sure it was made plain to them that, when the time comes, they would have to leave. </p>
<p>The host population has decided that time has come, now the guest-workers have to leave. </p>
<p>Simple. </p>
<p>So there is ZERO duplicity or &#8220;cruelty&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221; on view here; Japan is merely doing what it said it would do. Why are these Brazilians   &mdash;   regardless of their ethnicity   &mdash;   whining about not being allowed to stay when the Japanese never promised them anything of the sort? What part of &#8220;temporary work permit&#8221; don&rsquo;t they understand? They are attempting to renege on the deal they made when they first admitted onto Japanese terrority. </p>
<p>If only we had such control over admissions and expulsions in our (formerly) white countries! </p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;When Nikkei go back and can&rsquo;t return, for us that&rsquo;s discrimination,&rdquo; says Freitas, who has lived in Japan with his family for 12 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that IS discrimination, and the natives there should be glad they have a government that returns the rabble home when the work dries up.</p>
<p>And the rabble should be thankful they get compensation, because if it were there own country in the same position, they&rsquo;d set the immigrants loose in a leaky boat and a couple of gallons of water with a &#8220;Hasta La Vista, baby.<br>

<p>Women aren&rsquo;t opting out of marriage but due to overcrowding and the expense, couples both men and women are having fewer children. However, populations have had far more serious shortages, look at Europe after the Black Death, when one-third of the people died. They didn&rsquo;t import labor and eventually recovered. Countries have recovered from far worse. The truth is, work shortages can be solved by temporary or contract work, which is what these Brazilians are and were told from the beginning. Now there are work shortages and foreigners aren&rsquo;t needed.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s &#8220;harming&#8221; them. Let&rsquo;s see, Japan doesn&rsquo;t have race riots, racial and religious bakenization, ethnic voting blocks, islamic extremists and terror cells in their country, greatly increased crime and welfare usages from 3rd worlders. While Japan is in an economic slump, that&rsquo;s due to the rest of the world, not a lack of divesity. I&rsquo;d say Japan is far better off then the rest of the West.</p>
<p> &#8220;There was an article in &ldquo;Time magazine&rdquo; a few years ago and the title was &ldquo;Why Japan has no friends&rdquo; interesting read, but multiculturalism is growing and like it or not, the Japanese have to deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should the Japanese care what others think of their immigration policies, it&rsquo;s THEIR country and THEIR business. Also, NO the Japanese do not have to &#8220;deal with it.&#8221; They have the choice and the right to keep Japan Japanese. More power to them!!!! It&rsquo;s a myth that we &#8220;need&#8221; multiculturalism. We do NOT.<br>

That is how I see it too. If a country really does need to look outside its borders to expand its labour force, ok, an argument to let some in can be made, in my opinion. They are fairly compensated with a much larger salary than they would have dreamed of earning back home, as well as higher living standards, which is what attracted them in the first place, not the kindness of their hearts to help out a country in need of workers. There should be no access to citizenship, no complaining about kids having already integrated etc, and once they&rsquo;re no longer needed or have stayed beyond a reasonable length of time it&rsquo;s thanks for the help, but it&rsquo;s time to pack up and move back home. </p>

			<p>We simply can&rsquo;t imagine a country doing well that is not diverse can we! We need to send them the reverends Jackson and Sharpton to enlighten them! How about transplanting Detroit to Tokyo? </p>
<p>Hmmm not only are the Japanese who are born in other countries not considered to be on the same level with the Japanese born in Japan, but even the Japanese who were born and reared in Japan, but who have lived abroad for too long, are also considered to be lower on the ladder as well.  </p>
<p>The term &#8220;East - West&#8221; is not meant to be a term of endearment! </p>
