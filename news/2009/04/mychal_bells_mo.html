		<p>Was this support for Mychal?  I doubt it was, because I think he lived with her at the time this support was due.</p>

		<p>I cannot imagine the hew and cry that would have risen up if any of the &#8220;noose hangers,&#8221; or even Mychal Bell&rsquo;s victim, had this legal baggage in their background. Certainly the MSM would haved deemed that worthy of wall-to-wall coverage. The media silence on this is deafening.</p>

		<p>With making the child support payment such a token amount, it&rsquo;s no wonder that she didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. $155 a month to support a teenage boy? That&rsquo;s barely $5.00 a day, not even an hour of work at minimum wage. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the same heifer that bought a new BMW or something with the donations? I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll blame all her current problems on &#8220;seeing the noose&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Half a million bucks thrown at this &#8216;family&rsquo; and they cant keep up child support payments of $155 a month? <br>
Somehow I am not surprised, once her boy finishes his football scholarship and gets a job (!!!) money will be no problem&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Surely the court could make an exception in her case, since she did such an excellent job in raising a kid who never gets into trouble.</p>
<p>(Except minor things, like attempted murder, shoplifting, assault, theft, burglary, etc.)</p>

		<p>She bought a Jaguar, not a BMW. And she lives in a glorified shack. She bought a huge wardrobe of new clothes, went on lots of fancy vacations, etc etc. all with David Bowie&rsquo;s money. </p>
<p>She also has a rap sheet a mile long, as does Mychal&rsquo;s Dad. One of those convictions is for stabbing Mychal&rsquo;s father with a kitchen knife in a fight. She cut him good too. I can&rsquo;t prove this, but I did interviews with people in Jena off the record and they told me this stuff. These were big names in the community too.</p>

		<p>I understand that when the kid is in juvie detention, the parents pay the state child support and welfare for that kid is suspended.</p>
