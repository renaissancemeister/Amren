<h1>It&rsquo;s Back: Immigration Heats Up</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Latino leaders are pressuring the White House to set a goal of signing a major immigration reform bill by the end of the year. Friction between immigrant communities and local police seeking to enforce federal law is increasing, prompting hearings on Capitol Hill and scrutiny from the Justice Department.</p>
<p>And in less than two weeks, Obama will be in Mexico for a presidential summit in which immigration issues will be on the agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, politically, [Obama] is in a tough spot, and he recognizes that the public isn&rsquo;t where he is on immigration,&#8221; said Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, which bills itself as a &#8220;low immigration&#8221; think tank. &#8220;If you are Obama, it&rsquo;s a no-win situation, and there is no reason to bring this issue up right now from a political view. You can give a few speeches to the right groups and then say, &#8216;What else is on the agenda?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama dealt with the immigration issue briefly at the White House on March 18 when the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met privately with the president. Lawmakers said he promised a high-profile event on immigration in the next month or two  &mdash;  but said he did not agree to commit to getting immigration reform passed this year. Instead, he said he&rsquo;ll support efforts to have Congress take up the issue this fall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama also committed to assign a White House point person on the immigration issue but has not yet done so, the aide said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recession and rising unemployment rates are likely to undercut the already shaky public support for legalization of illegal immigrants. Business leaders are diverted by more immediate issues of corporate survival. And a surge in drug-related killings and assassinations in Mexico could stoke public fears that any immigration-related measure might cause that violence to migrate north, even though advocates insist reform would make Americans safer.</p>
<p>Asked whether the ailing economy would increase public resistance to immigration reform, the administration official said, &#8220;You might be right if the debate is about generosity versus being harsh to immigrants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s not about whether we&rsquo;re nice to immigrants or not. It&rsquo;s about whether we&rsquo;re doing a smart thing for the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The emotion the immigration debate inspires was on clear display on Capitol Hill on Thursday as two House subcommittees conducted a hearing on local efforts to detain illegal immigrants. One very high-profile drive, conducted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., with help from a cooperation agreement with the federal government, is now the target of a Justice Department investigation into possible civil rights violations.</p>
<p>Julio Cesar Mora, a 19-year-old Arizona man who is a U.S. citizen, complained that he and his father, who holds a green card, were pulled over and detained for three hours during one of the sheriff&rsquo;s immigration raids. &#8220;They patted us down and tied our hands together with zip ties like we were criminals,&#8221; Mora complained.</p>
<p>Another witness, Ray Tranchant of Virginia, described the death of his 16-year-old daughter and a friend in a car accident caused by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk and had been arrested before. &#8220;Instead of being deported, he stayed on the streets of Virginia Beach to drink and drive and subsequently killed these two beautiful girls,&#8221; Tranchant said.</p>

			<p>This is the time that will test the meddle of moderate Democrats in the Senate, such as Claire McCaskill (MO) and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), and others.  Save the latter, who wasn&rsquo;t in the Senate in 2007, they voted against &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; in 2007.</p>
<p>Did they vote against it because they were really opposed to it, or did they vote against it merely because a &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; President in the person of George W. Bush propose it, and they presume that, just as members of the party of the President lose elections in a bad economy even if their party isn&rsquo;t in control of of the House or Senate at the time of the sinking economy, and even if they disagreed with the President&rsquo;s economic policies, they were punished for merely having the same party label as that of the unpopular incumbent President, President Bush and all Republicans would have benefited from Hispanic approval of a successful attempt at soft amnesty for illegal aliens, though it would have happened mostly because of House and Senate Democrats, and in spite of Republicans in the same bodies?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have our answer pretty soon.</p>

			<p>Latino leaders are pressuring the White House to set a goal of signing a major immigration reform bill by end of the year. Translation: We want two sets of standards when it comes to federal law,we want to be treated differently,we want you to ignore the fact that we broke the law, we want everything the United States can offer us and we don&rsquo;t want to wait and play by the same rules as the rest of the world. These people have no shame,no honor and no moral character.I for one will fight them as long as I can.I have friends that came into this country the correct way. It was a process that I am proud they went through, and I am sure they are too, to be a part of this great country. To all Latino groups that may be reading this: you won&rsquo;t win. We are gaining numbers and momentum. We won&rsquo;t let you take our country from us!</p>

			<p>The anti-Western forces who run both US political parties don&rsquo;t need a formal &#8220;immigration reform bill&#8221; to swamp the USA with even more of the Third World  &mdash;   all they have to do is be passive with border enforcement and entry checks, and undermine even modest immigration restrictions via the federal bureaucracy, as Clinton did in 1996. And then voila, white-minority USA accelerated. (We&rsquo;re already a minority in the elementary schools, and back in Arizona where I hail from, the schools are overwhelmingly non-white.) Obama is a talented figure in many ways but, like the rest of the US elite, he sees political gains in swamping out the Western identity of the USA with more pliable, cheap-labor Third World immigrants. And he&rsquo;s doing just that.</p>
<p>All of us following the wretched demographic transformation of the USA know who the enemy is  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s Antonio Gramsci, the founding father of cultural Marxism, and the Gramscians whose chief project is undermining Western civilization from within.  Gramsci taught his followers to infiltrate cultural standard-bearers  &mdash;   beginning with universities (their main power base), then fanning out into the media and legal system, then into the think tanks, political figures and even business elites. Massive non-white immigration, followed by affirmative action and other perks, is the chief tool in the Gramscian&rsquo;s arsenal  &mdash;   undermining the very identity and solidarity of our nations. It is also the Gramscians who introduced political correctness, who elevated group rights and payback for &#8220;historical victims&#8221; as a basic part of our media culture. They even pitted our own womenfolk against us so much that our family law financially ruins white men to the point of being unable to renew (let alone support) their families. (The extremist PC interpretation of Title IX  &mdash;   in its &#8220;strict proportionality&#8221; form  &mdash;   is also a Gramscian invention, decimating the sports like wrestling and track that have long been crucial to forge young men&rsquo;s identities.)</p>
<p>The threat of the Gramscians is by now well-known, and we need to act. There&rsquo;s a lot of good discussion on sites like Amren, but we need to convert our thoughts here into practical, effective actions. And I&rsquo;m tired of hearing claims that &#8220;the Gramscians control of the media and government&#8221; makes action for our people impossible  &mdash;   that&rsquo;s just an excuse.</p>
<p>As a counterexample, look at the strong resistance that much of Europe is finally putting up  &mdash;   proof that we *can* bring action to protect ourselves. The Dutch anti-Muslim, anti-Third World figure Gert Wilders, after the British government arrogantly barred him from speaking in February, is now the most admired politician not only in Holland, but in most of Europe  &mdash;   so much so that the Dutch government, afraid of his ability to tap into popular anger, is implementing many of his very policies. The Danes and Austrians recently elected tough anti-Third World, nationalist parties, and both the Austrians and Germans are kicking out all of their remaining Turks and bolting the door behind them (while reinforcing their protection for gun owners, along with the Swiss). Nationalists in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Norway and even Sweden are making rapid gains (helped a lot by Wilders, both his example and his supporters&rsquo; coordination), while even France has shut its doors and deporting the North Africans. The 24/7 anti-BNP propaganda in Britain (from all directions) is making it much harder to get a foothold, but even there, the BNP are fighting the good fight and gaining support and donations.</p>
<p>The point being: Some places in the West are fighting back, and they&rsquo;re doing so effectively, from the elites down to the common people. If they can do it there in Europe, then we can do it here in North America, too  &mdash;   there&rsquo;s no excuse otherwise. Ever since our ancestors rose up against tyranny in the late 1700&rsquo;s, white Americans have fought hard for our rights  &mdash;   where&rsquo;s that spirit now? My friend, who reads and respects Thomas Chittum, feels that some sort of partition as in Chittum&rsquo;s Civil War II book is likely inevitable. I don&rsquo;t know, but at the very least, we have to start banding together as a group and taking action to protect our people. </p>

			<p>There is already an unofficial, de facto amnesty program in place. Her name is Janet Napolitano and she is blocking every effort by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to apprehend, detain and deport illegal aliens. </p>

			<p>To Drayton:</p>
<p>Do you think though that the different environment here in the U.S. is enough to insulate the majority of white people from the negative effects necessary to galvanize them into a coherent and unified entity? Are the average white people here feeling the same level of intrusion that the Europeans are?</p>
<p>In France, foreigners practically burned half the country to the ground and attacked the police in near open warfare. In Germany the Turkish &#8220;guest workers&#8221; had become a dangerous ethnic entity that pressed inwards on Germans of all backgrounds. </p>
<p>In Europe, each country&rsquo;s citizens can coalesce around a common national identity. Here in the U.S., those who control and manipulate our social infrastructure have preached that &#8220;celebrating&#8221; your own ethnicity - unless of course you&rsquo;re white - is correct, not uniting under one flag. </p>
<p>The average beer-swilling white man worships black athletes on a regular basis. White women find Obama handsome. Guilt-ridden, self-hating white people go out of their way to accomodate whiny, undeserving blacks. White contractors get their laborers from a 7-11 parking lot. </p>
<p>I fear that the only way anyone will ever see white people as a group taking a stand will only occur when whites everywhere perceive the same level of menace. When whites of all social strata suffer anti-white motivated violence, injury, and death, at the hands of minorities and immigrants, will they snap out of their &#8220;diversity stupor.&#8221; But by then, will it be too late?</p>

			<p>Our low life sell-out politicians make me sick. They know very well that Americans overwhelmingly are opposed to &#8220;immigration reform&#8221;  - which really means amnesty and reward for breaking our laws - but they don&rsquo;t care. They don&rsquo;t really work for us.</p>
<p>This together with the extent our politicians allow billions of our money to go for monster bonuses to corporate &amp; banking big shots proves again how they only really care about re-election and the block votes they pander to. They deserve to be despised. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Since taking office, President Barack Obama has seemed intent on keeping the politically explosive issue of immigration on the back burner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back burner?</p>
<p>He came right out a short while ago and announced for the benefit of the illegals that he was going to be getting to immigration reform ASAP.  That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a back burner item to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it once again:  How could anybody in his right mind do anything that might over leverage the legitimate work force in this country, with unemployment at about 15%, counting everybody, and set to gain somewhere between 20 and twenty-five percent of the population by the end of the year, if the government&rsquo;s own projections are used?  I mean, there are plenty of other MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE analysts predicting figures that are much worse, so at the very least were looking at very, very sparse times.</p>
<p>Too, is there anybody who doesn&rsquo;t believe giving legality to 30 million illegals will impact blacks the worst?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if this carefree man just giggles his way from country to country, interview to interview, chuckling about the deteriorating economic situation.  It&rsquo;s as if he really doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh says he has it planned that way, hoping for worse times STRICTLY for invoking all nine yards of his agenda under the cover of &#8220;stimulating&#8221; the economy.  I think that&rsquo;s partly true, but I further believe that his happy demeanor is just the usual norm for the laid back non-white crowd who have a problem with understanding the seriousness of a dire situation.  Too, it has to be considered that someone who thinks his people never really belonged in this society doesn&rsquo;t care if it crashes or not.</p>
<p>His one ultimate aim for about thirty years has been to upgrade the situation of blacks by hook or crook.  I have no doubt he&rsquo;s trying to shift the wealth in this country from whites to blacks, because not one single item of his agenda excludes the betterment of blacks someway, and any benefits to whites is only an unintended consequence that can&rsquo;t be avoided.</p>
<p>Get ready.  It&rsquo;s set to get far worse in a few months.<br>

			<p>Sending illegals back home will save American tax payers billions of dollars.<br>
The ruling class Freemasons in your government are importing a revolution of monarchy through the corporation.<br>
Send a tea bag to Washington and let the King George government know you oppose their crooked scheme to flood America and line their pockets.</p>

			<p>A couple of weeks ago, I read in the local rag that the preceding month showed a loss of 743,000 American jobs. That being on top of the millions of prior jobs (laid-off/unemployed American workers). So why in hell do we need more immigrants? Much less Congress dishing out millions more visas to would-be immigrants? Does no one in Congress have brains enough to understand the stupidity of bring yet more millions into our country. To compete with legitimate Americans in a rapidly shrinking job market?</p>
<p>For pete&rsquo;s sake, America. Wake the hell up and start telephoning, writing, faxing, even e-mailing your senators and congressmen. Let them hear from you in no uncertain terms that re-election is not that far off. That starting with the 2010 mid-term elections, there will be some serious changes in the House and Senate! That you will make an all-out effort to urge  everyone you know to oust any incumbent who seemingly doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot in hell what the citizen/voters need or want!</p>

			<p>The most obvious and least discussed problem in America is that key federal officeholders have no loyal regard for what Americans really want - they only pretend to care about such things just before elections. </p>
<p>At all other times they continue to diligently advance their privately supported one-world, anti-nationhood corporate agenda.</p>
<p>The dismantlement of national patriotic and cultural traditions, along with race mixing, offer two advantages for Socialist elites, the first erodes the core social unity within a population, and the second inevitably lowers average IQ among its citizenry. </p>
<p>The effects of both tactics make winning future control of a nation&rsquo;s collective political consciousness far easier for Socialist elites - who will, of course, never reveal themselves as such.</p>
<p>Take a look around at our national media and our national &#8220;leadership,&#8221; notice any tacticians out there?    </p>

<p>I think your right Quiet Professional. It will take a major depression or a series of natural catastrophes leeding to chaos to bring most whites out of their &#8220;diversity stupor.&#8221;</p>
