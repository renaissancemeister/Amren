<h1>County to Pay $4 Million to Settle Jail-Beating Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Norberto Santana Jr. and Tony Saavedra, Orange County Register, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>County officials have agreed to pay more than $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by an undocumented Mexican immigrant who was beaten by inmates while in custody at the Orange County jail, the man&rsquo;s attorney said Monday.</p>
<p>The settlement appears to be the largest ever paid by Orange County for an in-custody incident involving county sheriffs, according to county officials and the man&rsquo;s lawyer.</p>
<p>Fernando Ramirez, then 21, was left brain-damaged by inmates in Module A at the Orange County Central Jail in June 2006. He was jailed after a 6-year-old girl told her mother a stranger touched her over her clothes on her private parts at El Salvador Park in Santa Ana. Ramirez was charged with child molestation but eventually pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of non-sexual battery, said his attorney, Mark Eisenberg.</p>
<p>But Eisenberg said the jail&rsquo;s classification of his client contributed to the attack because other prisoners became aware of the sexual assault allegation. Deputies in charge of monitoring the jail that night were elsewhere in the jail when the attack occurred, Eisenberg said.</p>
<p>The ensuing beating left Ramirez with the intellect of a 4-year-old child. He is unable to walk unassisted and will need help for the rest of his life, said Eisenberg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eisenberg said a final settlement was approved Apr. 17 and described the amount as $3.75 million for Ramirez&rsquo;s family along with nearly $900,000 to cover all outstanding medical liens for medical care rendered while in custody.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eisenberg called the settlement &#8220;fair&#8221; noting that it will take care of Ramirez&rsquo;s medical needs for the rest of his life. He credited county officials for &#8220;stepping up and doing the fair and responsible thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>While County Supervisor John Moorlach would not comment on the details of the Ramirez settlement, he did say that Sheriff Sandra Hutchens has turned around a lax culture within the jails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moorlach also said several changes  &mdash;  such as cameras, more visible and mobile guards and a full shuffling of top managers  &mdash;  has helped to begin changing the culture that contributed to the Chamberlain and Ramirez beatings.</p>

<p>Which will be very, very short since I&rsquo;m sure his &#8216;loved ones&rsquo; are going to want to spend all of that money on his upkeep.</p>

			<p>I commented about the &#8220;F Street&#8221; story because I saw the protest and I live in Las Vegas, now I have to comment about my former stomping grounds of Orange County. Even Mexicans will beat one of their own if they are child moloesters. This is a taboo offense and child molesters and rapists are usually kept away from the general pop. because they will be killed by the other inmates. This is nothing new. And I do believe that Orange County will be renamed Aztlan in about 10 years.</p>

<p>Maybe he had the intellect of a 4-year old child before the beating. When a 21 year old man is trying to play &#8220;doctor&#8221; with a six year old girl, you gotta wonder.</p>

			<p>And then these idiots can&rsquo;t figure out why their county is going broke!  It really is beyond belief!</p>
<p>At least California has Carrie Prejean, the Miss USA contestant that finally stood up against the &#8220;political correct&#8221; movement that is very effective at eliminating free speach in this country.</p>

			<p>How about all the White inmates who have suffered beatings, and rapes in our desegregated prisons? No compassion for them? No9 dinero for them??? This illegal molester not only gets 4 MILLION but I will wager WE the taxpayers will pay for his SSA/SSI and he will become a citizen and a on our medicaid system that will pay for all his MILLIONS in medical costs! Not to mention bringing in all his family and cousins from Mexico to &#8220;help&#8221; care for the poor misfit.</p>

			<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less, California deserves this. They opened the door for these illegal invaders and now they reep what they have sown. I hope these invaders bankrupt this state and then maybe the revolution can begin.</p>

			<p> Ramirez, El Salvador Park in Santa Ana?? Sounds pretty third world south-of-the border to me</p>
<p>But lest us forget, this coumtry was built by mostly hispanic immigrants (and blacks)and though we may not understand or agree with this man&rsquo;s cultural mores, that makes them no less valid than our own. Or in the words of &#8216;The Decider&rsquo; George W. Bush, &#8220;Family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande.&#8221; </p>
<p>We should embrace this &#8220;Hard working man of family values&#8221; (another Bushism) and see what we can do as individuals to compensate his family and all his relatives in mexico for their pain and suffering in the face of unspeakable bigotry in the country he entered illegally.. </p>
<p>The six year old girl was probably White and asking for it. I&rsquo;m certain closer scrutiny would reveal her as an operative with the racist, vigilante Minutemen organization.</p>
<p>Let us place the blame where it is due and celebrate the diversity that made us the greatest nation in recorded history!!</p>

			<p>So how do the taxpayers feel about having their earnings paid off to the family of an illegal alien who was in jail for molesting a young girl.  Money well spent?   </p>

			<p>   Like I&rsquo;ve said for a long time, Kalifornia is a different country. Let them go broke. Let the masses of non-citizen (illegals) do their magic. We must cut them off, it is far too late to save Kalifornia. Whites should be helped to relocate out of that strange country. </p>

			<p>What else is new? Child rape is a national pastime with them (though I would question the testimony - which no doubt has been done). Child abusers are the very lowest life forms in prison - nothing new there either. There have been worse cases of inmates dealing with them.<br>
The only argument the family could make is the county was negligent in not putting him into solitary - or deliberately did it (in which case, they´d probably have sued also).<br>
One of the first things a guard learns is to keep away child molesters from the hard cases.</p>
<p>- My pity for both the perp and the county is somewhat limited.</p>

			<p>there is an attitude that if someone goes to prison that they deserve whatever might happen to them. i strongly disagree. there are many people in prison for victimless crimes ie possession of drugs. now, i dont support substance abuse of any kind. but i dont think someone should be beaten or raped for it. furthermore, i suspect there are many people in prison who were falsely accused of sexual crimes. ive read that its common in divorce/custody battles for lawyers to advise their clients to claim abuse whether any exists or not. and in some states youre considered GUILTY until proven innocent, which can be very difficult to do. yeah, its easy to say the sob deserved a beating and shouldnt have been compensated. but we need to look at the bigger picture and see that prison violence is out of control. and that the people bearing the brunt of it are more likely to be some sap who went in for pot or dui than murder. in summary, i think prison should be unpleasant. take away their television, put them on chain gangs and feed them beans and water three times a day. but dont let prisoners beat and rape them. because thats just not right. money talks and maybe this will encourage oc to clean up its act.</p>

<p>In Kuwait and Saudi, if a non citizen (legal of not) is involved in an accident, a ruling is generally AGAINST the foreigner. The Arab&rsquo;s way of looking at it is that if YOU weren&rsquo;t in the country, the accident wouldn&rsquo;t have happened!!</p>

			<p>Are these $4 million plus damages compensatory or punitive?  I can understand the compensatory part, with his lifetime health care needs.  But that much money for compensatory not regarding health care is insane, because there is no way that a Hispanic in Hispanic-heavy cheap labor Southern California is going to earn $4 million in aggregate through his whole life, such that the county needs to pay his family that much for compensation.</p>
<p>He would have to average $80,000 a year for the next 50 years to get to $4 million.  He would have been lucky to get to a half a million.</p>

			<p>I believe that a week or so back, we were estimating what illegals actually cost California, as opposed to Gov. Schwartzenjammer&rsquo;s lowball figure. So let&rsquo;s add $4,650,000.00 to that total, because (and only because) Fernando Ramirez was in this country.</p>
<p>None of this would have happened if he had not been here.</p>

<p>Not quite true. If the girl had been 10 years old and up, instead of 6, the mexicans would have left him alone. This is well known here in SoCal. They have a very different view of what child molestation is, in that they don&rsquo;t consider 10 year olds a child as we do. </p>
<p>If this guy hadn&rsquo;t been a pedophile, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been in jail for touching a 6 year old girl. If he hadn&rsquo;t sneaked across the border, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been in a U.S. jail period. I would bet the attorney will be sure to pocket 40% of the money as they usually do here in CA, not the &#8220;mere&#8221; 33% that people think they do. This stuff has been a goldmine for many attorneys, which is why they favor continued illegal immigration. </p>
