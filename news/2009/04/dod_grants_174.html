<p>IMMEDIATE RELEASE 	No. 204-09</p>
<p>March 31, 2009</p>
<p>The Department of Defense announced today the awarding of 37 grants totaling $17.4 million as part of the fiscal 2008 Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program.  The grants will enhance education programs and research capabilities at the 30 recipient institutions in scientific disciplines critical to national security and the DoD.</p>
<p>This announcement is the result of a merit competition for HBCU/MI funding conducted for the DoD Research and Engineering directorate, the Army Research Office (ARO), and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  This is the second HBCU/MI grant award for fiscal 2008. In June 2008, the DoD announced $14.1 million in phase one grants (http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11976).</p>
<p>Research grants ranging from $245,000 to $574,000 will have a performance period of 36 months. Grants will be made by the ARO and all awards are contingent on the successful completion of negotiations between the DoD and the academic institutions.</p>
<p>The list of recipients for the second fiscal 2008 funding is available a[t] http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20090331HBCU2.pdf .<br>

			<p>The FY08 DoD Program for HBCU/MI AWARD RECIPIENTS includes surnames that are rarely associated with someone who is African-American.</p>
<p>It appears the grants went to people of Oriental and Caucasian ancestry suggesting HBCU find it easier to hire people for science, engineering, and mathematics faculty positions from those cultures.</p>

			<p>Since when did Black People become vital to our national defense.  In reality, the expense of maintaing the Black Man in America has jeapordized US Securiety.</p>

			<p>Blacks are basically a drag on the military services, just like they&rsquo;re a drag on everything they go near. Still, they join the military in large numbers so I guess the DoD figures throwing money at historically black colleges can&rsquo;t hurt and might help.</p>
<p>It was my military experience that convinced me that anyone over age forty who is still dealing with blacks on a daily basis  &mdash;  unless he is a cop or a prosecuting attorney  &mdash;  probably messed up somewhere in the game of life.</p>

Maybe the DoD is paying them fat bonuses as combat pay.</p>

			<p>Is there anything more useless than a black with a college education.  Propped up their whole lives.  Never held to any real standard.  Never made to work or accomplish anything.  Its even worse when from a black college.  Maybe African American studies are critical to the US Defence.  Real African American studies reveal things that aren&rsquo;t very PC.</p>

			<p>I followed a link from AmRen to the Caste Football site, and it proved to be a good choice. One article there detailed how programs like this are necessary to have any hope of finding black people with advanced degrees. </p>
<p>For instance, major universities will gladly fill their student bodies with blacks of questionable academic ability, but they usually won&rsquo;t go so far as to completely fudge a degree in a hard science&hellip;thus, for instance, major universities produce more black communications majors than physics majors. </p>
<p>However, an HBCU/MI, protected by the Cult of Diversity, can goof around with its degree requirements in absolute secrecy. So, for instance, Morgan State University can produce a math major of dubious ability&hellip;and should anyone be foolish enough to question the quality of said &#8220;mathematician&rsquo;s&#8221; skill level, immediate accusations of racist intent will silence everyone involved.</p>
<p>With this grant program, the DoD can avoid the difficult position of not finding an Obama-acceptable number of blacks with a degree in a hard science at the major universities. Instead, they get the bargain-basement deal from an HBCU/MI, then bury them in an obscure, non-mission essential posting somewhere deep in the bowels of the defense industry. </p>

			<p>You may as well take that $17 million and flush it down the toilet. And then we as a nation wonder why we are broke and why our economy is in &#8220;crisis.&#8221; What a sick joke&hellip;</p>

			<p>This is now happening in England. £206 million EXTRA just for ethnic schoolchildren, this is over and above the cost of the existing national corriculum spent on all pupils. But there is regular comment on how poor White boys are failing in their studies and exams. Just a cursery look at where these live is telling. They reside, almost without exception, in &#8216;mixed&rsquo; black/pakistani or areas with a high proportion of immigrants or decendents of immigrants. These boys are afflicted with the mumbo-jumbo african &#8216;street culture&rsquo; of rap, drugs, crime and a total lack of respect for society but the government shows no inclination to spend money on these White English boys. No great surprise that &#8216;Wire&rsquo; has been such a success over the first week of viewing over here. The programme content really has it&rsquo;s parallel in UK and most commentators agree that we do have a very serious black african street crime problem. I only hope it&rsquo;s not lost on our police force.</p>

			<p>RE: &ldquo;If I were smart enough to teach college level science, engineering, and math, I&rsquo;d still rather teach in a White high school than a black college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OK but it&rsquo;s easy for a foreign professor to get an H-1B visa to teach in HBCU at salaries and under working conditions much better than in third-world countries.</p>
<p>That often leads to citizenship and wholesale immigration of the professor&rsquo;s extended family.</p>
<p>Just look at any HBCU roster of faculty in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and you will find very, very few black faculty members.</p>
<p>Any black professor minimally qualified to teach in those departments can get salaries from top tier Ivy League schools two or three times the amount HBCU can pay.</p>
<p>Moreover, foreign professors in the math-science areas are brilliant and work tirelessly so that if they come up with a new invention or discovery, they will qualify for 8(a) Business Development Programs to finance a new company.</p>

			<p>Enough venting! The DoD spends billions for all sorts of causes that appear to be useless. Some are useless, some, like DARPA grants that support new technology are more constructive.</p>
<p>In this case, propping-up the traditionally black-racist colleges is a bribe to appease the mulatto-in-chief. It surely is not a legitimate investment in research.</p>
<p>However, little will change if the readers of this blog do nothing more than vent here. Stand-up at your next town-hall meeting and speak in favor of having our government banned from recording race data. Insist that we return to a MERIT based society and that we cease all selection, hiring, and promotion that is based on race or gender.</p>

Interesting idea, Clairese, but I&rsquo;m not so sure it&rsquo;s really a good one. That would make us just like France, which also bans collection of racial date, and it&rsquo;s not working so terribly well there. Cuba too, I believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily the collection of racial data that&rsquo;s bad, but how - and for what -  it&rsquo;s used.    </p>
<p>And also, I should add, by whom.<br>

<p>We must have relevant race data so we can know where the benefit checks go.</p>
