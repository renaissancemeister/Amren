<h1>Elephant Exodus Reported From Troubled Zimbabwe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angus Shaw, AP, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Growing pressure from poaching and human encroachment in Zimbabwe has driven hundreds of elephants to migrate from the country and at least one leopard to stalk an upmarket Harare suburb, conservationists said Monday.</p>
<p>The independent Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force appealed in its latest monthly bulletin for more action  &mdash;  and money  &mdash;  to preserve the troubled nation&rsquo;s wildlife.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe&rsquo;s economic meltdown, &#8220;humans are encroaching more and more into areas previously reserved for wildlife,&#8221; the task force said.</p>
<p>As many as 400 elephants have crossed the Zambezi River, which separates Zambia from northern Zimbabwe, in recent months, said Johnny Rodrigues, head of the task force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The task force and a Zimbabwe animal group received official authority to capture and transport the elephants to Chipinda Pools, believed to be their original home area 125 miles (200 kilometers) to the south.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In northern Harare, rangers also wanted to track and kill at least one leopard, which also is suspected of having a cub. Rodrigues said the task force set up drugged, baited traps for predators so they could be returned to the wild, but none has been caught since a guard dog was attacked earlier this month.</p>
<p>Tourism and photographic safaris have dropped sharply during years of political and economic turmoil since the often violent seizures of thousands of white-owned farms began in 2000, disrupting the agriculture-based economy in the former regional breadbasket.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Poaching of small animals has intensified, with villagers torching the bush to drive even rodents and rock rabbits into traps for food, conservationists say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conservationists already have raised the alarm for Zimbabwe&rsquo;s rare rhinos after a sharp increase in poaching over the past year because of a breakdown of law enforcement in the country.</p>
<p>The head of the state Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, Morris Mtsambiwa, told state media Monday that his nation faced censure from CITES, which regulates trade in endangered species, for the surge in rhino poaching blamed on &#8220;well-coordinated local, regional and international syndicates.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Here is an unbelievable article I found a year ago. White farmers in Zimbabwe also had huge wildlife preserves on their land. Since whites were driven off or murdered, blacks have killed and sold off 90+% of the wildlife. They have used chainsaws to mutilate elephants, so they could sell the ivory to the Chinese to buy weapons. You can&rsquo;t even make this level of savagery up, happening now to the most magnificent creatures on earth.<br>
  This is a great example of the racial difference between whites and blacks, as far as the way we treat animals. <br>
  This is also the best article to show to the &#8220;green / animal rights&#8221; types, as usually they are also &#8220;anti-racists.&#8221; Watch them fumble for an excuse to describe this:  <br>

			<p>The NAACP and the ASPCA have joined forces in stamping out stories in which black Africans are cruelly slaughtering endangered species.  These obviously invented stories are but another example of white racism.</p>

			<p>As some one who lived in that area for 24 years, escaping in 1999 to retire in Spain but keeping in touch as relatives are still stuck in SA, liberals just will not accept the facts that despite all the evidence. black Africans(as opposed to white ones), especially Marxist trained terrorists, just cannot administer effectively and so these African countries never reach the potential that they had under former white rule.   An ex-SA friend, now legally resident in the US, told us that she recently went back for a visit and cried when she saw the filthy state of the streets and the ongoing terribly violent crime still. She wishes she had never gone to see her old home. </p>
<p>The ANC promised all the blacks homes and jobs to get the votes but 15 years later, apart from a few brick shacks that have been built with tax payers (mainly whites&rsquo;) cash and they are falling down within 6 months (affirmative action builders) and the HIV problem is still major, etc, etc..</p>
<p>So sad, as the continent has a lot of potential but watch out for major food-aid claims in the near future as the West will get blamed for global warming when it finally arrives due to the expected solar activity, and te productive white farmers have had their land stolen or they have been one of the 3 045 murdered since 1994.</p>

			<p>These elephants have been roaming Africa for millenia and will find alternative grazing land elsewhere.</p>
<p>As far as the people are concerned only this: African governments have been telling the west (whites) that Zimbabwe is not the west&rsquo;s concern. It&rsquo;s time the west start believing them and allow them to fix their own problems by cutting aid.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe chased away their whites and now want ( or actually demand) aid from foreign whites.</p>
<p>Each and every black citizen of Zim at some or other point voted for Mugabe and the Zanu-PF. Let them enjoy the fruits of their &#8221; liberation &#8220;.</p>

<p>Reminds me of an article I read on zasucks.com (actually its blogspot predecessor) over 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Basically a lion or similar big cat was terrorizing a village. So they set up a bait with some meat&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
&hellip;someone stole the meat.</p>

			<p>I was in Zimbabwe back when it was called Rhodesia and was governed by Whites. You know, even in the midst of a guerrilla war, this sort of thing did not happen. You had a lot of &#8220;African&#8221; wildlife, giraffes and elephants, roaming about without much in the way of danger to them.</p>
<p>One wonders if there is going to be anything left of this country in another decade of black majority rule?</p>

			<p>In the great film about post-colonial Africa, [i]Africa Addio[/i], they show what happened to the wildlife after the whites turned over power: it was systematically exterminated. </p>
<p>The whites came back, and the game laws were enforced again, for a time. The whites were driven out again, the poaching started anew. </p>

<p>How can this be, now that with Bad Old Whitey driven out of the country, there is no shortage of farmland?</p>
