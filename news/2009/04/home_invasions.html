<h1>Home Invasions Soar As Thugs Seek Mexico Drug Cash</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maria, who has no connection to the criminal underworld, is among scores of law-abiding Tucson residents caught up in a wave of violent so-called home invasions, most of them linked to the lucrative trade in drugs smuggled from Mexico. Maria had bought the house weeks before and the gunmen believed drug traffickers were using it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Five years ago, police say home invasions were virtually unheard of in Tucson. Now the crimes run at three to four a week, as criminals go after the profits of the illicit trade in marijuana, black-tar heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine through the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve always dealt with those in business establishments, banks and convenience stores, it was very unusual to see them in houses,&#8221; Roberto A. Villasenor, Tucson&rsquo;s assistant chief of police said of the recent trend. &#8220;The home was seen as a safe spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>CAUGHT UP</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A year ago, Tucson police department set up a special unit to target the rising number of home invasions. Since then, the officers have investigated at least 173 cases scattered across the city, three-quarters of them tied to the drug trade, investigators say.</p>
<p>The assailants  &mdash;  typically teams of two to six people  &mdash;  frequently dress in tactical gear and identify themselves as police officers, Drug Enforcement Administration agents or SWAT team members as they burst into houses to steal drugs, cash or guns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While most raids target the drug trade, some have branched out and gone after students and other law-abiding residents, Azuelo said. Others assault families who just happen to live in a house that was once used to deal drugs, or simply because the attackers got the wrong address.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SEEKING MORE AID</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced a $184-million plan to crack down on the smuggling of narcotics, guns and money by criminal gangs that threaten security on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>The plan also allocated $59 million to help local law enforcement tackle border-related crime  &mdash;  a lifeline welcomed by Tucson police.</p>

			<p>Much of the blame for this can be laid at the feet of government policies such as the &#8220;War on Some Drugs&#8221; and no-knock raids.  Because government acts with tyranny and impunity toward citizens, there&rsquo;s no way to discern whether armed goons, breaking in your door, are police or drug cartel members.  Even if you&rsquo;re armed and prepared, how are you supposed to know whether the people you&rsquo;re defending your family against are law enforcement or criminals? Really, they&rsquo;re both criminals, only with different bosses.</p>

			<p>There is really only one solution to what is happening to the white world, and that is for whites to drive out virtually all the non-whites.</p>
<p>The way it needs to be done is by doing whatever it takes.</p>

			<p>The Big &#8220;O&#8221; answer is to disarm Americans citizens so to make it safer for illegals to do home invasions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both sides of the border?&#8221;  If she even thinks about interfering with ANYTHING on the Mex side, she&rsquo;s going to run into a brick wall.  The Mexicans will demand that the US keep its nose out of their business.  And all the while they will instruct her on how many illegals she must give citizenship to, and that she must not put armed military on the border as they do on both of their borders, north and south.  They&rsquo;ll also require more Mex offices in more cities in the US to overseer US treatment of its citizens, who illegally sneaked into the US.</p>
<p>And, she will meekly obey, because she&rsquo;s a wimp and shouldn&rsquo;t be in charge of anything, let alone a department assigned to protect the US.</p>

			<p>  Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid that Mexico is exporting its problems to the United States. As more Mexicans move North a tipping point will be reached and it will be difficult to know where the border stops. Arizona seems to be on the front line of these troublesome trends. </p>

<p>Not really, there may be more Mexicans and their gangs on OUR side of the border than the Mexican side.</p>

			<p>All this money to protect the border.  I know many people who would love to sit on the border and plink the illegals as they show their faces.  Our traitorus government continues to pretend to protect us!  Can you imagine what these criminals would do to the general population if we didn&rsquo;t have the RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS??</p>

<p>Those were exactly my thoughts as I read the above.</p>
<p>The police really need a better way for their boot and shoot raids, because if it&rsquo;s an innocent household and the homeowner answers their bashing with a half dozen rifle shots I really doubt the authorities could get a conviction from juries in most rural locations. Maybe urban or suburban areas, but some of those types will refuse to convict as well. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not part of the &#8220;castle&#8221; law enacted in several states, but if I&rsquo;m on the jury I&rsquo;ll let the prosecution know right up front that I won&rsquo;t convict the people protecting themselves, if they&rsquo;re not involved with drugs and would reccommend that the police be charged as well.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the answer?  I don&rsquo;t know.   But if I were on a police force I&rsquo;d keep working on the problem until I came up with a foolproof way the inhabitants would know for sure when it is the police.</p>
<p>Of course, the best thing to do would be to legalize drugs.  Like alcohol the war on drugs will never be won&hellip;..nor even reduced significantly.</p>
<p>When alcohol was illegal, crime and violence were rampant everywhere, just as drugs are today.</p>
