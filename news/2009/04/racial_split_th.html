<h1><a href="/articles/2009/04/02/opinion/columns/04022009column01.txt">Racial Split Threatens State Democrats</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Minor, Greenwood Commonwealth (Greenwood, Mississippi), April 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A rump group of state [Mississippi] Democratic Executive Committee members, led by Vice-Chair Barbara Blackmon, who is black, held a special meeting on March 21 with a goal of ousting several previously chosen white leaders of the state party  &mdash;  a move that had classic signs of driving white Democrats out.</p>
<p>Removal of state Democratic Chairman Jamie Franks was in the air, but the group decided only to sack their other target, state party Director Sam Hall, and replace him with Blackmon&rsquo;s hair dresser. Both Franks and Hall are white.</p>
<p>In a further insult, the rump group voted to restore controversial Ike Brown to the executive committee, despite a federal court finding that Brown violated the Voting Rights Act by intimidating white voters as a Noxubee County party official.</p>
<p>Franks immediately disavowed the rump meeting and its actions. Then, a week later he convened a session of the administrative committee to formally put Hall back on the payroll as the state party director. At the same time, the committee hired Christopher Smith, who is black, as the party&rsquo;s field man. Smith gained creds last year working in the successful campaign of 1st District Democratic U.S. Rep. Travis Childers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Mississippi Democrats had high hopes that the election on Nov. 4 of Barack Obama as the nation&rsquo;s first black president would bring new energy for a resurgence of the state Democratic Party, after years of seeing the state trending Republican.</p>
<p>When the 1965 Voting Rights Act enfranchised thousands of black voters in Mississippi, they flocked to the Democratic Party as the party of their heroes, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. They became the backbone of the state party, but for a decade the party ranks were riven by a racial split.</p>
<p>In a historic reconciliation, the division between the black-white wings of the state party was healed in 1976 when they united behind Jimmy Carter as the party&rsquo;s presidential standard-bearer at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.</p>

			<p>90% of Mississippi&rsquo;s whites (and 80% of whites under 30) voted McCain, or more specifically, voted against Obama.  The problem for white Democrats in Mississippi is that there are hardly any left.  Politics in MS are becoming a racial headcount.  And that&rsquo;s what we need for the whole country if whites are to survive.</p>

			<p>The smart thing to do would be for the Republicans and White Democrats to find some common ground and gang up on them.  Blacks would never win another election in Mississippi.</p>

			<p>I went to high school with Jamie Franks&rsquo;s cousin. Both of them are huge Obama supporters, to the extent that I could no longer maintain our friendship. I say it serves him right after pandering to blacks and ignoring his own people.</p>

<p>Well-meaning, naive, foolish, ignorant, whites will never understand how the sting is run.</p>
<p>First blacks play the victim. Whites rally to their aid. Blacks become the majority. Blacks show their true racist nature. Whites are shocked. Repeat.</p>

<p>Why is anyone surprised?</p>
<p>This is what confuses me so much about white &#8220;Leftists&#8221;, Democrats etc:<br>
Did they honestly think that - after repeatedly favouring their black, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, etc electorates over their white ones for decades - that the aforementioned electorates wouldn&rsquo;t eventually replace them with &#8220;<i>someone <b>who looks like me</b></i>&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Something like this happened in my town, a considerable sized city. 6 or 7 city counsel prospects, all black with the exception of one white, fared off in a primary election, with the winner (being stamped as the democratic) virtually being guaranteed a seat on city counsel in the general election. The lone white guy got the most votes. The democratic party got together and decided to field the next highest voter in the general election instead. </p>

<p>Here in North Carlina, although the state has voted Republican in presidential races (besides Obama), the state legislature has a prominence of Democrats and Democratic influence. As does almost every large city in &#8216;North Carolina&rsquo;.<br>

			<p>When you&rsquo;re 13% of the population, identity politics is not a good way to get or maintain power. If whites get kicked out of the Democratic Party, it will dissolve as an institution due to the lack of votes behind it.  </p>

<p>On a national level but blacks are about 40% of the population in Mississippi. I&rsquo;m under the assumption, and maybe I&rsquo;m wrong but I thought most Southern Democrats were the so called &#8220;Blue Dog&#8221; Democrats who were conservatives.  I don&rsquo;t understand why they would operate in the same party as the athiests, sexual perverts and the femnazis.    </p>

<p>Exactly! Can&rsquo;t wait. What we will be left with is a Democrat Party of Angry Black Socialists and Us.</p>

			<p>Each year I become less sympathetic to blacks complaining about the discrimination heaped upon them in days of yore when I see that as soon as they have some power themselves, they discriminate against other races shamelessly and relentlessly.</p>
<p>I recently read a book, &#8220;Deer Hunting With Jesus&#8221;, in which the middle class author returns to his rural, blue collar Virginia neighborhood and writes about the people there.  His basic thesis is that they&rsquo;ve been duped, regularly voting for Republicans who work against their class interests.  Why don&rsquo;t they wake up and vote for Democrats who&rsquo;ll give them free health care?  (Funded with those vast surpluses our Federal government always runs.)  Well, aside from the fact that the Democrats are all very eager to grab their guns and teach their children about homosexual marriage in elementary school, there is the simple matter that the Democrats have become the anti-white party.  The Democrats overwhelmingly favor illegal immigration and mass immigration, and consider it their sacred duty to make whites a minority as soon as possible.  They also favor relentless discrimination against whites.  It is true that the Republican Party hardly puts the concerns of the working class high on their agenda.  But when the only alternative is the party of Nancy Pelosi Barney Frank, and <a href="https://www.congressionalbadboys.com/Savage.htm" rel="nofollow">Gus Savage</a> what is there to do but hold one&rsquo;s nose and vote Republican?</p>

People who don&rsquo;t like the Democrats should see this as good news. It is a form of disintegration of the party.</p>

<p>Hahahahahahahaha!!  The only thing they will get together on is how to pander to more minorities and getting more money out of White taxpayers.  The Republicrats and Demolicans are the SAME PARTY.  Only a fool believes there is any difference.</p>

			<p>This runs much deeper than a simple party split. It&rsquo;s a party being split along racial lines. Eventually this could evolve into &#8220;Da Black Democratic Party&#8221;. Then as a minority party they could seek &amp; likely get federal funds like the naacp, black caucus &amp; la raza have managed to do. Then, in the classical black tradition they would allege that the white Democrats are racist. Then they would file endless lawsuits paid for by the American taxpayer against the white party attempting to financially destroy it. The very same thing could happen the the Republican party as well should enough black become members. </p>

			<p>1976 is not a good indicator of anything, b/c Jimmy Carter was a Southern Governor, which fooled many white Southerners into thinking he was one of them.  George Wallace (who was in the Democrat field for President with Jimmy Carter) even got sucked into this, by endorsing Carter.</p>
