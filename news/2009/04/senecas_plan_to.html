<h1>Senecas Plan to Establish Independent School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Herbeck and Peter Simon, Buffalo News, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unhappy with the education their children receive in traditional public schools, leaders of the Seneca Indian Nation plan to start their own independent school in the fall of 2010.</p>
<p>They also intend to seek state and federal aid for the new school, and the diversion of those funds has public school administrators worried.</p>
<p>Planning for the new school  &mdash;  which would be known as the Seneca Academy and would have campuses on the two main Seneca Nation territories  &mdash;  is being done with help from experts at Buffalo&rsquo;s prestigious Nichols School.</p>
<p>Seneca leaders complain that their children aren&rsquo;t learning enough about Seneca traditions, culture, language and history in the public schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, we&rsquo;re sending Seneca children into a foreign enterprise which is designed to educate them into becoming good New Yorkers and good Americans,&#8221; said Robert Odawi Porter, counsel to the Seneca Nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through history, [educators] have tried to turn Indian children into white people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to preserve our Seneca identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those accusations draw heated denials from public school administrators, who say they provide American history and language courses to help Senecas succeed.</p>
<p>In addition, the educators are concerned that losing Seneca students would mean the loss of millions of dollars in government funding and could lead to layoffs in districts where Seneca students attend school in large numbers.</p>
<p>The decision also has set off a debate among the Senecas themselves, with some tribe members worried about the effects of separating their children from the outside world.</p>
<p>Seneca children for generations have received their education at schools run mostly by white people. Currently, about 1,050 Seneca children attend public schools in the Salamanca, Gowanda,</p>
<p>Lakeshore and Silver Creek districts where they attend classes with white, Hispanic and black children.</p>
<p>But some Seneca leaders also claim that their children can be treated unfairly in the public schools.</p>
<p>Seneca students who attend public schools have unusually high suspension rates and unusually low graduation rates from high school, Porter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are obviously good people involved in public education,&#8221; the Seneca attorney said, &#8220;but they&rsquo;re selling a product that doesn&rsquo;t work for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plan approved by the Seneca Tribal Council last August calls for the establishment of the Seneca Academy, which would run schools on the Cattaraugus and Allegany reservations. Nichols School headmaster Richard C. Bryan is advising the Senecas and is a member of the Seneca Academy&rsquo;s board of trustees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brian Seneca, a tribe member who lives in Irving, likes the idea of a separate school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Seneca language is disappearing,&#8221; said Seneca, who has two sons in the Silver Creek schools. &#8220;My sons are getting a good education. They do get some training in Seneca history and language, but I would like them to get more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyce Waterman Cruz, 64, of North Collins, also supports a Seneca school, saying it will help preserve the tribe&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to make sure this school teaches them about the outside world, too,&#8221; said Cruz, who has five grandchildren attending the Lake Shore schools.</p>
<p>But Maxine Black, 69, and Reggie Crouse, 72, of Salamanca, are not in favor of the new Seneca school. Both said they consider it a bad idea to segregate Seneca children from others.</p>
<p>Seneca culture, history and language are already taught in public schools and can be reinforced by individual families, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bad part about it is isolating the kids from other people,&#8221; Crouse said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not &#8216;us versus them.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re all part of the same world.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Decades of dispute</b></p>
<p>Many Senecas have felt that some public school teachers show little sensitivity about the Indian nation and its customs, said Lana Redeye, who served as the tribe&rsquo;s education director in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>Hard feelings also stem from the negative experiences many Senecas had at the state-operated Thomas Indian School, which closed in the 1950s, and long-standing resentment over the fact that the Seneca Nation owns all the land in Salamanca and leases property to city residents, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Seneca parents staged a boycott and temporarily pulled their children out of the Salamanca schools because they felt Seneca culture was being ignored and some Seneca students were mistreated, Redeye said.</p>
<p>This year, one Seneca elementary school student was threatened with suspension for refusing to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance, Waite said.</p>
<p>And a Seneca girl at the high school was threatened with suspension because she put up posters accusing Christopher Columbus of &#8220;grand theft, genocide and racism&#8221; against American Indians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Public schools reply</b></p>
<p>One charge that some Seneca leaders make against public schools is that the public schools seem determined to turn Indian children into whites. Redeye, Waite and Carrie Peterson, the tribe&rsquo;s other education director, said they strongly agree with that statement.</p>
<p>Leaders of the school districts that serve Indian children said they are stunned and upset by the allegation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s an astonishing statement to me,&#8221; said O&rsquo;Rourke, superintendent at Silver Creek. &#8220;We worked very hard to be partners with the Seneca Nation and its Education Department. We teach Seneca language and Iroquois history to all our students, not just the Native Americans. We have great respect for the cultural identity and the language of the Senecas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silver Creek staffers took a reporter to a first-grade classroom where 6-year-olds  &mdash;  both American Indians and whites  &mdash;  were learning full sentences in the Seneca language.</p>
<p>Each child could count to 31 in the Seneca language.</p>
<p>In Salamanca, Seneca customs and culture are taught at the elementary, middle and high schools, and Seneca language instruction is offered beginning in seventh grade, Hay said. Those programs are regularly evaluated by an Indian education committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school districts also provide training for their teachers about American Indian customs and the bad experiences that some Senecas have had with public schools in the past.</p>
<p>Andrea Cooke, a Seneca who teaches in the Gowanda Schools, said it&rsquo;s important for Seneca children to learn about their tribe and its history. At the same time, she said, they must also learn about the world outside the Seneca reservations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do our native children walk in two different worlds?&#8221; Cooke said. &#8220;I think they do.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I sure wish I had the choice of two worlds to walk in.  If I only had a reservation to go hang out with fellow Whites, do a little hunting and fishing, tell hero-tales, do a little polka dancing and drink a couple beers while getting government money and running gambling racketts to get more money from dumb non-Whites.</p>
<p>Obviously, very tough to be an Amerind.  Could I only have such problems.</p>

<p>Even the Indians don&rsquo;t want to be part of the rainbow coalition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the rank and file of any group want to live among another race, keeping their own traditions, culture, history, heroes, and language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering what part of &#8220;rejection&#8221; the leftist emotionally disabled doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care what we want, really, as long as we do as they say, because it makes them feel all warm and fuzzy.</p>
<p>Can somebody tell them that being in the midst of civil upheaval WILL NOT make them feel like hugging anybody?</p>
<p>But break it to them slowly, unless you can stand to see a grown up cry uncontrollably.<br>

Our own local &#8216;angry black man&rsquo; talk show radio host, Ted Kirkland, just loved this piece. He sees the same problem with blacks; black parents allow their black children to be taught by white teachers and blacks fail because whites are trying to make them &#8216;white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkland also objects to increasing the school year for Buffalo public schools. Ya know why? Because if black inner city schools have longer school years than white suburban schools, black kids will think there&rsquo;s something wrong with them that they have to be in school longer. Seriously.</p>
<p>The solution is of course segregated schools. Interestingly, when anyone calls and makes this suggestion as a caller did last week, Mr. Kirkland plays dumb, acts confused, and wonders why anyone would make such a suggestion. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how they use the phrase &#8216;rainbow&rsquo; to describe diversity.<br>
Because when you think about it, the only colors that diversity actually brings to the rainbow is different shades of brown.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;ll still be a better school than most public schools. Private and charter ones usually are. If they were Cherokee, I could definitely see it surpassing the others in the area, as we have a very strong work ethic and value education more than most other Native nations do. We&rsquo;re the butt of jokes in Indian Country for our success, but that&rsquo;s not our problem.</p>

<p>And they&rsquo;re right.  I can agree with the Senecas on this. Who can blame them?</p>
<p>For several centuries, the schools, from the earliest times of European settlement, have been trying to &#8220;make the Indians white&#8221;.  Should this be any surprise?   After all, education, schools, are a white thing   &mdash;    a white invention. (Did the Indian tribes operate schools???) So of course, they were run by whites and according to white standards. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s highly interesting that we&rsquo;re only hearing complaints about it now and a fewfound desire for separation. Could this be, just possibly, a reaction to the increasing integration of blacks in American society, and a natural desire to get away from them just as whites try to do?  Interesting thought.<br>

			<p>Good move on the part of the Senecas.  Same thing going on in Hawaai.</p>
<p>People like being around people like themselves.  We whites  &mdash;  we indigenous people of Europe in the European diaspora  &mdash;  need to start demanding our own schools for our own people.</p>
<p>Of course, as in the past, various non-whites will figure that we&rsquo;re getting the better deal and demand to soil our schools with their presence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we whites really started circling our wagons and openly reject diversity.</p>

<p>And now the public &#8220;education&#8221; (indoctrination) system wants them to be black.</p>
<p>At least the Native Americans get it&hellip;</p>

<p>That must be due to white racism. It can&rsquo;t possibly be that the white students have higher average intelligence.</p>
<p>It was just a coincidence that when whites arrived in the Americas the Indians were naked, had no written language, practiced human sacrifice and had not yet invented the wheel. Clearly their societies were just as advanced as ours!</p>

<p> When I wanted to know the language of my Italian immigrant grandparents, they came over and spoke it in our home, and I took classes in it at a local college. I nor any member of my family did not hold the public schools accountable.I remember reading  that Chinese families in our area used to send their children to Chinese language schools during the week in order to learn Chinese. I don&rsquo;t know if that is still the practice among Chinese Americans. Both these examples go to show that we don&rsquo;t need to blame or hold accountable the public schools when it comes to teaching a language or culture. </p>

<p>They probably would know. While white kids in inner city schools are tormented by black kids on a daily basis and the only ones who will ever notice (even at the schools themselves) are the folks who happen to read AmRen. Those in the city are too worried that a Black kid might be offended somehow to notice. In fact, they probably need to come up with some more news coverage about insults to black folk as we speak.   </p>

			<p>The Senecas are welcome to start their own school, I&rsquo;m sure&hellip; but does it make sense given the reality that unless the Senecas want to perpetuate the negative image of Indians, they&rsquo;d want to get the same education and acquire the same skills as Whites? If all you learn is antiquated tribal customs, practices and beliefs, how would that knowledge prepare the Seneca youngsters for a career in our &#8220;White Man&rsquo;s Country.&#8221; </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;some Seneca leaders make against public schools is that the public schools seem determined to turn Indian children into whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke, right?   He&rsquo;s saying this about government schools that are bending over backwards, using precious educational time to teach a little known/little used language and culture to ALL of students, including Whites  &mdash;  with White taxpayer funds, no less.<br>
  <br>
The reality is that the &#8216;public&rsquo; schools are determined to destroy Whites and Western Civilization  &mdash;  read a mandated high school history or English textbook lately?</p>
<p>The entire curriculum revolves around this theme: </p>
<p>Whites are the evil scourge of the earth, determined to destroy and wipe-out non-Whites through genocide.  Western Civilization represents slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, segregation, racism, economic disempowerment, disenfranchisement, and unfair White-favoring laws used to put NAMs behind bars for life.  All White inventions and achievements were stolen from non-Whites.  This country was built upon the labors of non-Whites, White wealth is a result of making non-Whites poor.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the interests of redress and social justice, Western Civilization must be destroyed along with the people that created it. The stolen wealth and land must be rightly confiscated and redistributed to the rightful owners of such.  </p>
<p>This will be done by debasing White language, distorting their history, placing all blame for non-White failures on evil Whites.  In such an evil, racist culture, non-White-on-White crime and violence are justified. And,  present-day Whites must be made to pay for what they&rsquo;ve done to non-Whites, no matter how long ago. All of them, by virtue of their skin color, are guilty, guilty, guilty. </p>
<p>With that in mind, let &#8216;em separate.  It will help build a case for White separation (no matter how far-fetched it seems now).  </p>
<p>Hopefully, in the future, the following will be said:</p>
<p>&#8220;White leaders complain that their children aren&rsquo;t learning enough about White traditions, culture, language and history in the public schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is, if Whites are even free to say any such thing in the future without a knock on the door  &mdash;  or a knock on the head.   The present communist administration in control of the government is certainly headed in that direction.</p>

			<p>The Indians don`t object to being turned into white people, they object into being turned into stupid white people. What they really want is an Indian parochial school with moral teaching, discipline, and racial pride. These things are not taught in our modern schools. Perhaps the Senecas are tired of their kids dropping out by age 14 and being alcolholics and drug addicts by age 16. They will learn what the Black Muslim parents learned in DC. Racial pride, morality, discipline, lift test scores by about a factor of three and cut drop out rates to nearly zero. I say go Senecas and be seperate. Cultural diversity destroys culuture; love of the clan and tribe saves it.<br>

			<p>Passed though the areas in question many times and it looks just like the rest of Western and Upstate New York, except maybe a little more poor and run-down than the rest of that lousy part of the country.  Their &#8220;culture&#8221; is already entirely merged with the White Man&rsquo;s.  Many of those &#8220;indians&#8221; I&rsquo;ve seen on the reservations appear to be mixed breed, as well; many could easily pass for white.  Just another scam to get free money  &mdash;  they already don&rsquo;t pay many of the taxes other New Yorkers pay. They are also trying to take back land that is supposedly owed them, currently owned by white farmers and families who barely get by in that overtaxed wasteland.  </p>

			<p>Using this logic, shouldn&rsquo;t white southerners get independent schools?  After all, most white southerners in states like GA, AL and MS have some Indian in them, the reason for that being the initial white exploring parties going west in what is now the deep south included no women.  Therefore, the white men only had Indian women to relate to when that time came.  The children were taken in as the whites&rsquo; own.</p>
