<h1>Graduate School Admissions, Race, and the White Status Game</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Sailer, VDARE, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All across the country, applicants to graduate and professional schools have been receiving fat letters of acceptance or thin letters of rejection.</p>
<p>They have a right to feel nervous. They&rsquo;ve sweated through college and through rigorous standardized exams, which they hope will open the door to their chosen professions. But the prestigious postgrad programs are ruthless about selecting the best candidates (at least if they are white or Asian). So, applicants obsess over whether their 165 LSAT K-12 education or 680 GMAT is good enough to get in.</p>
<p>But, paradoxically, the faculty of the top schools seldom preaches what they practice when it comes to K-12 education or immigration. They are fiercely selectionist about who they let in to their institutions. Yet they lecture American citizens about how we should be lax about whom we let in to our country.</p>
<p>There is much that can be learned from the study of average test scores from the major postgrad exams. The idiosyncratic scoring systems do make them seem impenetrable to outsiders, but fortunately, they are all graded on the bell curve, so I&rsquo;ve come up with a handy table that makes them easy to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve accumulated recent data on the average scores by race for five exams: the <a href="/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0809_factors_2006-07.pdf">GRE</a> for grad school, the LSAT for law school, the MCAT for medical school, the <a href="/NR/rdonlyres/F3B73942-8A93-4FC2-BB8D-1E8735158B80/0/ProfileofGMATCandidates0408.pdf">GMA</a> for business school, and the <a href="/prof/ed/testing/dat/dat_users_manual.pdf">DAT</a> for dental school.</p>
<p>To make all the numbers comprehensible, I&rsquo;ve converted them to show where the mean for each race would fall in percentile terms relative to the distribution of scores among  non-Hispanic white Americans. Most of us have some sense of what the distribution of talent is among whites  &mdash;  political correctness doesn&rsquo;t demand we  avert our eyes when it comes to whites  &mdash;  so I&rsquo;ll use whites as benchmarks.<br>
<div class="text-center"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">  <tr>    <td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td>    <td colspan="5" align="center">Mean Score as Percentile of White Distribution</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Test</td>    <td>Degree</td>    <td>Year</td>    <td>White</td>    <td>Black</td>    <td>Asian</td>    <td>Tot Hisp</td>    <td>Mex-Am</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>GMAT</td>    <td>M.B.A.</td>    <td>2008</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">13%</td>    <td align="right">55%</td>    <td align="right">27%</td>    <td align="right">24%</td>  <tr>    <td>GRE-Verbal</td>    <td>Ph.D./M.A.</td>    <td>2007</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">18%</td>    <td align="right">47%</td>    <td align="right">29%</td>    <td align="right">28%</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>GRE-Quant</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>2007</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">14%</td>    <td align="right">66%</td>    <td align="right">29%</td>    <td align="right">28%</td>  <tr>  <tr>    <td>LSAT</td>    <td>J.D.</td>    <td>2006</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">12%</td>    <td align="right">47%</td>    <td align="right">19%</td>    <td align="right">29%</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>MCAT-Verbal</td>    <td>M.D.</td>    <td>2007</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">10%</td>    <td align="right">36%</td>    <td align="right">19%</td>    <td align="right">21%</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>MCAT-Phys Sci</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>2007</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">14%</td>    <td align="right">61%</td>    <td align="right">24%</td>    <td align="right">25%</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>MCAT-Biol Sci</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>2007</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">10%</td>    <td align="right">54%</td>    <td align="right">24%</td>    <td align="right">25%</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>DAT</td>    <td>D.D.S.</td>    <td>2005</td>    <td align="right">50%</td>    <td align="right">16%</td>    <td align="right">60%</td>    <td align="right">27%</td>    <td align="right">NA</td>  </tr></table></div><br>
Thus, for example, on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the gatekeeper for the M.B.A. degree, the mean score for whites falls, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">definition,</a> at the 50th percentile of the white distribution of scores. The mean score for black test-takers would rank at the 13th percentile among whites. Asians average a little better than the typical white, scoring at the 55th percentile.</p>
<p>Most of these tests break out separate nationalities among Hispanics. Thus, my table has columns both for <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">&#147;Total Hispanics&#148;</b> (27th percentile on the GMAT) and <b>&#147;Mexican-Americans&#148;</b> (24th percentile). In the 2000 Census, Mexicans made up 58 percent of the Total Hispanic population.</p>
<p>I listed the subtest scores for the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) because the sources didn&rsquo;t aggregate them.</p>
<p>Note that language is a surprisingly small problem for Hispanics  &mdash;  they score no worse on the GRE Verbal subtest than on the GRE Quantitative, and only moderately worse on Verbal portion of the MCAT. Why? Because Hispanics who have problems with English generally don&rsquo;t finish college, or even high school.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll note, the black average scores are consistently low across all five tests, plus the listed subtests. The scores for Asian Americans are generally good, but they bounce around depending upon the balance of verbal vs. quantitative/visual questions. The Total Hispanic and Mexican-American scores are dependably mediocre  &mdash;  better than blacks, worse than whites.</p>
<p>If we look at how many people of each group take the test, we can understand the variations in average score a little better.<br>

Thus, for example, whites, who in 2007 made up 61.5 percent of the 20-24-year-old cohort, took 68.7 percent of the GMATs. Blacks took the GMAT at a per capita rate just under half (49 percent) of the white rate. Asians are more than twice (205 percent) as likely as whites to sit the GMAT. Mexicans are only a fifth (18 per cent) as likely.</p>
<p>(If you are wondering why America&rsquo;s white elites aren&rsquo;t more worried about their kids facing competition from the huge number of Mexican immigrants they&rsquo;ve let in, this educational indolence is one answer  &mdash;  at the highest levels of American society, Mexican-Americans just aren&rsquo;t much competition.)</p>
<p>We are often lectured about how our racist society crushes the fragile self-esteem of African Americans. But this combination of average score and sample size data suggests that blacks tend to have inflated ambitions, especially compared to the under-ambitious Mexican American population.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve heard a poor black child interviewed on TV say <b>&#147;I want to be a doctor or a lawyer when I grow up&#148;</b> while the television personality nods encouragingly. But it&rsquo;s many more times than I&rsquo;ve heard a poor black child say, <b>&#147;I want to own my own carpet-cleaning business when I grow up.&#148;</b></p>
<p>Consider the Law School Admission Test. Blacks made up a sizable 10.3 percent of LSAT-takers in 2006, while Mexican-Americans comprised only 1.6 percent, barely up from 1.1 percent way back in 1985. This large number of black law school hopefuls suffered from diminishing marginal returns: their mean score equated to just the 12th percentile among white test-takers.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mexican Americans scored at the semi-respectable 29th percentile among white. That was because only an elite few out of their ranks dared take the LSAT at all. If more Mexicans had tried it, their average would likely have been lower.</p>
<p>What nobody tells those black children is that even if you get into medical school or law school, you still have to pass a professional licensing exam when you get out.</p>
<p>Data gathered by Richard Sanders of the UCLA Law School shows that <a href="https://isteve.blogspot.com/2006/09/sacrificing-smart-black-kids-on-altar.html">53% of the black students</a> who enter law school fail to qualify to become lawyers, versus 24% of white students. About 40 percent of black law school graduates (many of whom will have taken out crushing loans to pay three years of tuition) never pass the bar exam, compared to 15 percent of whites. Some will also waste additional years working dead-end day jobs while paying to take bar exam review courses at night, before finally giving up in despair.</p>
<p>In effect, the legal establishment is luring a sizable number of the black race&rsquo;s more promising young people (not the very best and brightest blacks, but well above average African Americans) into a career cul-de-sac. That warm and fuzzy feeling that liberals get from <b>&#147;diversity&#148;</b> comes with very real human costs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that blacks take all five tests at relatively similar rates, while Asians specialize in the medical professions and tend to avoid grad school (probably because it prepares for generally lower paying careers). In a diverse society, it&rsquo;s natural for racial groups to specialize in certain occupations the way Asians do. Yet, blacks don&rsquo;t. One reason for that: blacks are counted as <b>&#147;diverse&#148;</b> for affirmative action purposes, <a href="https://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/asian.htm">while Asians generally aren&rsquo;t.</a> The grad schools&rsquo; <a href="https://www.leaderu.com/alumni/sowell-choosing/chpter07.html#black">institutional hunger for black students</a> means that blacks aren&rsquo;t allowed to develop ethnic specialties.</p>
<p>You might think, for instance, that blacks would be more inclined to take the DAT to try to get into dental school than the MCAT for medical school. After all  &mdash;  and this is not intended as an insult to dentists: the <i><a href="/prof/ed/testing/dat/dat_users_manual.pdf"> DAT User&rsquo;s Manual</a></i> testifies to the enormous effort the American Dental Association has put into making the DAT an extremely rigorous 4.5 hour-long test  &mdash;  studying one part of the body is surely less daunting than studying all of it.</p>
<p>But instead, blacks are relatively more likely to take the MCAT (where they do very badly: about the 11th percentile) than the DAT (where they face somewhat less competition and score at the 16th percentile).</p>
<p>Yet what would be the reaction of American Association of Medical Colleges and the <a href="/ama1/pub/upload/mm/20/testimonyoctober.pdf">American Medical Association</a> if a healthy trend developed in which blacks focused more on dental than medical school?</p>
<p>A national crisis would be declared! The medical community would be instructed to mobilize its vast resources to fight off the challenge from dentists for  precious diverse students! Bidding wars for blacks would get even more flagrant!</p>
<p>And the Law School Admission Council is probably even crazier for diversity than the medical colleges.</p>
<p>In short, none of these powerful institutions will allow blacks to develop their own specialties. All of them compete against each other for scarce black talent. This is not because they care about blacks, because (as we&rsquo;ve seen) many of blacks are burned out by being mis-selected. </p>
<p>Many blacks might be better off going to business school than to law or medical school because you don&rsquo;t have to pass a <a href="/ar/2006/01.html#article3">licensing exam</a> afterwards. You just get your diploma and put <b>&#147;M.B.A.&#148;</b> on your resume. (How much <i>that&rsquo;s</i> worth is, however, another question altogether.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another example of the intra-white status game. To adapt what I wrote some time ago: what white admissions officers in grad schools care <b>about &#147;is achieving social superiority over other whites by demonstrating their exquisite racial sensitivity and their aristocratic insouciance about any competitive threats posed by racial preferences.&#148;</b></p>
<p>Our culture doesn&rsquo;t give practical advice to young blacks  &mdash;  because it would be <b>&#147;racist&#148;</b>. <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d sure like to see the breakdown of just who is being classified as &#8220;white&#8221;. After looking at Richard Lynn&rsquo;s breakdown of IQ averages around the world etc, I found it interesting that N. Europeans had IQ averages that were basically the same as E. Asians (actually a couple of points higher) although the &#8220;structure&#8221; of the intelligence is different between the two groups. E. Asians have their IQ averages calculated separately from those of lower scoring SE Asians but in Europe and the US different caucasian groups are just lumped together as &#8220;white&#8221;.  Here in the US all kinds of Middle Easterners, Afghanis, Kurds, Eurasians and in fact hispanics and many others are classified as &#8220;white&#8221;. I wish they would break this down further. For E. Asians we know basically we&rsquo;re looking at people of Chinese, Japanese and Korean extraction. For white, it can be almost anything. Strange. </p>

			<p>Though Asians are often considered smarter than whites, this test confirmed what I already knew - that whites do better on qualitative subjects than Asians. When I went to high school, I noticed East Asians often were tops in math and hard sciences, but when it came to history and English literature, it was always whites who took first place. And that was true of East Asians who were totally fluent in English (i.e., no language barrier). Whites&rsquo; higher qualitative scores also make you wonder about why Europe achieved more productive and democratic societies than Asia. It takes more than math and science smarts to make a society really hum along.</p>

<p>They do?  What are you reading?  This is what I keep reading Lynn wrote (in &#8220;IQ and Global Inequality, 2006&#8221;):</p>
<p>Hong Kong - 108<br>
Singapore - 108<br>
North Korea - 106<br>
South Korea - 106<br>
Japan - 105<br>
PR China - 105<br>
Taiwan - 105<br>
Italy - 102<br>
Mongolia - 101<br>
Switzerland - 101<br>
Austria - 100<br>
Luxembourg - 100<br>
Netherlands - 100<br>
Norway - 100<br>
United Kingdom - 100</p>
<p>Where do you see Northern Europeans on a par with, much less outperforming, NE Asians?  By the way, note Italy (a Southern European country) outperformed most of the Northern European ones.  Also note that Portugal (a supposedly heavily racially-mixed Southern European society) outperforms Ireland, a Northern European nation.</p>

			<p>The real story is that Native Botn White Americans are being forced to compete with post-1965 asians for another scarce resouce within the borders of America.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Sailer come right out and call for a complete shutdown of asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION? Of course, what Sailer means by a more selective immigration policy is:let the asians in;keep the hispanics out.</p>
<p>It is obvious that hispanic immigration should be completely shut down. But it is also just as obvious that asian immigration should be completely shut down.</p>

			<p>Why has there never been an investigation into Obama and his militant wife as to how they got into Harvard law school and what scores they made on their SAT and LSAT to discover any minority preferential treatment they recieved in admissions and also if they got their schooling paid for by taxpayers? <br>
Neither one ever used their law degrees but was this because they failed to pass the bar exam finally sluffing off all govt free funding it cost taxpayers to educate them?<br>

<p>This a link is to an IQ table from Richard Lynn&rsquo;s &#8220;Intelligence and the Wealth and Poverty of Nations.&#8221;  I think you&rsquo;ll find it very helpful and perhaps more along the lines of what you&rsquo;re looking for:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/cvppcw" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/cvppcw</a></p>
<p>Notice that Lynn lists the IQ of Italy as 102, and the IQ of Norway as 98. Italy (obviously) is far to the south of Norway  &mdash;  does that disprove (or at least question) the theory that IQs of Whites decrease from north to south in Europe (and yes, I know that statistically scores of 98 and 102 are very close, less than one SD)?</p>

			<p>Did you ever notice when white people in positions of power want to grant preferential treatment to blacks it is always at the expense of some other white.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of any white person voluntarily giving up their job or spot in a university for a minority?</p>
<p>Neither have I. It is always another white person they have in mind. </p>

			<p>There is a very interesting response to this post by Sailer by a poster named TRUEX(I Jupiter&hellip;AM NOT TRUEX). Have a look at it.</p>
<p>His or her post makes a point that I have been making here and other places:the obssession with racial differnces in IQ scores is completetly irrelevant to the White Nationalist cause.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue facing Native Born White Americans is their racial dispossession within the borders of America at the hands of post-1965 asians,hispanics,blacks and muslims. The IQ of these different post -1965 groups is completetly irrelevant to this issue.</p>
<p>Sailer the mad calibrator posts this stuff because it is 1) an attetmpt on his part to create a White-asian coalition in the new America and 2)it is Sailers backdoor strategy to create a justification for previous post-1965 asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION and maintaining current levels of LEGAL aisn immigration. Sailer has never made a strong condemnation of post-1965 asian immigation despite the fact that a very strong case has been made against here and other places. Although to be fair to Sailer, he does not censor criticisms against post-1965 LEGAL immigant asians and its American born geneline.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s a test someone created.  It purports to identify the intelligence of people.  Yet isn&rsquo;t a test in which the results do not correlate to the reality we see around us virtually useless?  If the IQ test reported results saying Africans were the smartest people in the world, wouldn&rsquo;t these results be meaningless in light of the complete and total decripitude that exists across the African sub-continent?  But no, Africans aren&rsquo;t the smartest.  But the results do indicate that Asians are smarter than whites.  I assume this includes the Chinese?  Aren&rsquo;t these results worthless then?  China is a basically a large, overpopulated, third world country which has accomplished virtually nothing other than theft of western technology as well as severe suppression of the wages of working men and women.  You see when I look at China as a whole, I&rsquo;m not seeing a great abundance of inteligence despite what a so-called &#8216;IQ&rsquo; test indicates.</p>
<p>The most important point I&rsquo;d like to make is this.  Anyone can create a chart that lists countries and assigns numbers to them.  Where did these numbers come from?  Who took these tests?  How many people took them in each country?  What was the criteria for selecting test takers?  Did they select ten of the top Chinese students at Beijing University?  Did they then select ten fat white guys from a trailer part in Mississippi?  We don&rsquo;t know?  What was the objective of the chart preparer?  It would be so easy to create the chart and desired results in advance of any testing.  You could then test suitable individuals to collaborate the fake results.  The point is that I&rsquo;m not buying it!</p>

			<p>Everyone knows of the bell curve.</p>
<p>For those us that don&rsquo;t know, the bell curve is a graph. On the horizontal axis you have IQ and on the vertical axis you have population numbers, so typically the IQ versus population numbers graph would be in the shape of a bell.</p>
<p>On the left where the bell starts you would find the idiots and as the IQ increases so to would the population numbers, until it reaches the population&rsquo;s AVERAGE IQ, then as the IQ increases further the population will decrease, as you have fewer and fewer geniuses. It always forms the shape of a bell.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare the IQ/population graphs of different population groups. One comparison that has been taken out of context, is the Asian and Caucasian comparison.</p>
<p>All we are told is that the Asian AVERAGE IQ is higher, but that is only part of the story.</p>
<p>If one were to superimpose the bell curves of the Asians and the Caucasians one would note that the Asian bell curve would have a narrower bell with an higher apex. </p>
<p>The Caucasian bell would be shorter and fatter.</p>
<p>What this means is that although the Asians have a higher AVERAGE IQ, the Caucasians have more people at the ends of the bell curve.</p>
<p>This means that although there are more idiots in the Caucasian population group when compared to the Asian population group, the Caucasian population group also have a lot more geniuses.</p>
<p>It takes genius to invent things, which explains why the Caucasian population group have always been the pioneer in terms of inventions.</p>
<p>So whilst the Asians have a higher average IQ the Caucasians have more people with very high IQ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we also have more retards. LOL  </p>

			<p>The debate over how Europeans could create much greater countries and technology than E.Asians who have slightler higher IQ&rsquo;s has been answered. I have been all over the world, and trust me, ancient China could not compare to Greece, Rome, etc&hellip; So what causes the difference? The anwser is in the bell distribution. European&rsquo;s have  a much greater variation in IQ than do East Asians. We have more dummies but we also have more men at the highest level&rsquo;s of IQ which are the men that propel society. Asia has no Da Vinci, Kepler, or Newton. Men like Newton were not of this world, almost freakish in intelligence.He could go home on holidays and invent calculus. The smaller range of genetic distrubution in Asia shows up not only in metal capacity but physical as well. The average Asian is 5&rsquo;8 with black hair with a slim build and it does not deviate that much from the baseline. Not as much as Europeans anyway.</p>

<p>Itis one minute before midnight for Native Born White Americans within the borders of America and some people want to have have a discussion about the Bell curve,Muray-Hernstien and Lynn. It is complete insanity. Just take a look at the two repsonses to your post. The reduction of Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority bceause of the passage of the 1965 immigration reform act should be the only topic of discussion. What is this nonsense about the bell curve being relevant because it will play a role in formualating a more selective immigration polcy. These arwe just code words for eithetr maintaining or increasing LEGAL asian IMMIGRATION. It is a stupid wonkish discussion that Sailer loves delve into on vdare.com. Itis a compete waste of scarce resources. All non-white post-1965 immigration should be shut down to 0!!!! And this is just the beginning. How did Native Born White Americans survive all those decades when there was basically 0 LEGAL asian IMMIGRATION? Quite well thank you. Enough with these boring and irrelevant wonkish discussions.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer is completely silent about asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Considering the huge<br>
platform that Steve Sailer has over at vdare.com,the flagship immigration refrom web site&hellip;think it is about time that he and Peter Brimelow tell us their views on asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION past and present.</p>

==============================</p>
<p>Maybe social structure played a role here. Read both reviews of a now forgotten (or just as probably, suppressed) book called &#8220;Sex and Culture&#8221; by J D Unwin from the 1930s.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Anonymous&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t read Lynn&rsquo;s work - he quoted from an extract that left out bits and pieces of information. German isn&rsquo;t even listed for example. The Wiki entries on Lynn&rsquo;s work had been so full of errors and attacked by so many people that they had to be locked - with a fair amount of wrong info in place. Pull up any article on Lynn&rsquo;s work in Europe - look up the &#8220;IQ League&#8221; for example. Germany is listed at 107. Koreans are not listed at 108, they&rsquo;re listed at 105 and Japan at 103. In fact, Lynn&rsquo;s work seems to be fluid, in that the numbers seem to change every couple of years depending on which report or study you read. All I know is that E. Asians on average seem to have better math ability, and Whites on average have better verbal/analytical and divergent thinking ability. In the end, while the Asian supremacists rely on professors struggling for some way to not put Whites at the top of any lists in order to avoid being called &#8220;racist&#8221;, the fact is that on average Asians do better in academic situations than they do in real life. Look at the missile launches in Korea, China, Japan over the last two decades, most of them with stolen or bought White Western technology they can&rsquo;t master yet. There is no argument from anyone that E. Asians lead the field in intellectual and patent theft. Maybe their particular intelligence structure allows them to understand and comprehend, but not necessarily be able to put things together in creative a fashion as Whites. Someone pointed out in another thread how NASA has experienced more problems and failures since it was required to be more &#8220;diverse&#8221;. This may fall in line with Asians tending to do less well than Whites on tests that examine problem recognition. This difference in problem recognition might also be tied to innate &#8220;personality&#8221; make-up as some have suggested. </p>
<p>I do think some people are on the right track by pointing out that Whites likely have a wider field of distribution in IQ than Asians. While a lot of Asians do well academically, when we see the top &#8220;geniuses&#8221; and creative people listed in most scientific and technical fields today (not to mention other areas), the Whites easily outnumber the Asians. A wider distribution curve could be the answer. The study by Daniel Vining pointed in that direction and more studies should be done. The differences in IQ structure are already known. A little known bit of trivia regarding the SAT is that the percentages of students of all races who score over 700 in the math portion of the test are higher than the percentages who can score over 700 in the verbal portion of the test. This isn&rsquo;t a language issue. Some of it is study and even more of it is analytical reasoning. The SD (standard deviation) in IQ is always listed as 15, yet in studies (Jensen) the SD for Whites is 16.7, blacks 15.1, and the small bit of work on E. Asians (12.8). There was a &#8220;study&#8221; by Gottfredson claiming that Asians had a slightly wider bell curve than whites, but apparently his work was politically motivated, to say the least. He seems to have a wish to degrade most White &#8220;groups&#8221; and exaggerate all levels of performance in the positive for non-whites. Even &#8220;La Griffe&#8221; (www.lagriffedulion.com), who is really no friend of Whites, has openly pondered the wider SD for Whites. It&rsquo;s probably the truth. Just as some Whites are irritated if one points out that Asians seem on average to be more gifted in mathematics, Asians get out of control if it&rsquo;s suggested that Whites have a wider SD and on average have much more creative and divergent thinking ability than Asians. The results in the real world point to all of this being the way things are. Like others have mentioned, there&rsquo;s little doubt that E. Asian scientists are probably researching Caucasian DNA (and physical brains) to find that element responsible for the difference in creativity. Even an article in an African Publication pointed out what seems to be obvious in the real world - Asians may average a few ticks higher in IQ, while Whites seem to have the edge on the far right hand of the curve against Asians (and on the left, lol): https://www.africancrisis.co.za/Article.php?ID=8403&  Some of the Africans amazingly enough don&rsquo;t seem to be as edgy as the Whites. </p>
<p>There are most likely elements of intelligence or types of intelligence that can&rsquo;t be measured yet, at least not quantitatively. But people do know what they see in the real world. For all the PC praise the ancient culture in China for example receives, it really doesn&rsquo;t match the Greeks for intellectual advancement, Rome, etc as noted above. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;There was a &#8216;study&rsquo; by Gottfredson claiming that Asians had a slightly wider bell curve than whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I have not seen that particular study by Gottfredson, and in general have no quibble with your fine post about IQ differences as the field is wide open to interpretation  &mdash;  some of it quite outlandish (but amusing as &#8216;experts&rsquo; such as Gould, twist in the wind trying to explain away hard evidence that contradicts his own theories).</p>
<p>Here is an excellent article by Ruston &#8220;The Mismeasurement of Gould&#8221; debunking many of Gould&rsquo;s widespread theories:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/c64xgj</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the current oppressive PC climate, voices such as the late Gould&rsquo;s are the ones that receive the most press, praise and publicity, while voices of reason, with lots of hard evidence to back them up, such as Lynn, Ruston, Francis, Murray are swept away, dismissed, ignored  &mdash;  and of course branded as racist.</p>
<p>For the record, Gottfredson is a woman  &mdash;  Leslie S. Gottfredson.</p>

<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.[S]He seems to have a wish to degrade most White &#8216;groups&rsquo; and exaggerate all levels of performance in the positive for non-whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I have read many of Gottfredson&rsquo;s articles, but not all of them, and have not sensed that she has a wish to degrade Whites.</p>
<p>Here is an article by Professor Gottfredson debunking Flynn entitled &#8220;Shattering Logic to Explain the Flynn Effect&#8221;:</p>

<p>Interesting thread.</p>
<p>Look up some of the bizarre things that have been done in E. Asian schools, particularly Japanese grade schools, in the attempt to increase creativity. It&rsquo;s not a giant leap to believe they&rsquo;re trying things at a higher level so to speak. They&rsquo;ve stolen a lot of other things, and DNA samples are rather easily available.</p>
<p>As for Ms. Gottfredson, her name is Linda, not Leslie, so both posters are wrong, but I think that&rsquo;s because almost everyone posting on threads hammers out their answers quickly. Regarding Gottfredson disparaging whites, she does. I&rsquo;ll leave it at that. But you can look up her work that involves certain groups enhancing their relationship with blacks to see her political bent, which behind all of the grandstanding seeks to attain the same goals as that fraud Gould. I doubt Gould believed one bit of the material he spouted when it came to IQ or culture. </p>
