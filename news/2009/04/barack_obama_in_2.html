<h1>Barack Obama in His Own Words (Part II of III)</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Henderson, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> April 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote><i>Part I, which is available <a href="/news/2009/03/barack_obama_in_1.html" target="part1" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none" target="part1" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here,</b></a> examined Barack Obama&rsquo;s deep agonizing over his multi-racial identity</i></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obama signals his obsession with race in the subtitle to <cite>Dreams From My Father</cite> (DMF), &#8220;A story of race and inheritance.&#8221; For Mr. Obama to have agreed to such a subtitle, both in the original and in its re-issue in 2004, is a sign of something that becomes painfully evident in the books, that here is a man possessed by race and stuffed with black victimhood.</p>
<p>In DMF, Mr. Obama parades his racial anxieties right in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>When people who don&rsquo;t know me well, black or white, discover my background (and it is usually a discovery, for I ceased to advertise my mother&rsquo;s race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that I was ingratiating myself with whites), I see the split-second adjustments they have to make, the searching of my eyes for some telltale sign. They no longer know who I am. Privately, they guess at my troubled heart, I suppose   &mdash;   the mixed blood, the divided soul, the ghostly image of the mulatto trapped between two worlds.&#8221; (DMF, p. xv.)</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obama wants to break out of the trap and be one of the &#8220;brothers,&#8221; as he casually refers to blacks in DMF. This makes him hostile to any mixed-race person who does not identify entirely as black. After describing, even with a certain sensitivity, the dilemma of one mixed-race woman, he brushes her aside.</p>
<blockquote>She was a good-looking woman, Joyce was, with her green eyes and honey skin and pouty lips. We lived in the same dorm my freshman year, and all the brothers were after her. One day I asked her if she was going to the Black Students&rsquo; Association meeting. She looked at me funny, then started shaking her head like a baby who doesn&rsquo;t want what it sees on the spoon.
<p> &#8220;I&rsquo;m not black,&#8221; Joyce said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m multiracial.&#8221; Then she started telling me about her father, who happened to be Italian and was the sweetest man in the world; and her mother, who happened to be part African and part French and part Native American and part something else. &#8220;Why should I have to choose between them?&#8221; she asked me. Her voice cracked, and I thought she was going to cry. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not white people who are making me choose. Maybe it used to be that way, but now they&rsquo;re willing to treat me like a person. No   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s black people who always have to make everything racial. They&rsquo;re the ones making me choose. They&rsquo;re the ones who are telling me that I can&rsquo;t be who I am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>They, they, they. That was the problem with people like Joyce. They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people. It wasn&rsquo;t a matter of conscious choice, necessarily, just a matter of gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way street. The minority assimilated the majority culture, not the other way around. Only white culture could be neutral and objective. Only white culture could be non-racial, willing to adopt the occasional exotic into its ranks. Only white culture had individuals. (DMF, pp. 99&ndash;100.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Or take Mr. Obama&rsquo;s conversation with Mark, a mixed-race half brother by Mr. Obama senior&rsquo;s second white wife who worked in the United States as a physicist. Mr. Obama met him during his first trip to Kenya:</p>
<blockquote> &#8220;You don&rsquo;t ever think of settling here?&#8221;
<p>Mark took a sip of his Coke. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, there&rsquo;s not much work for a physicist, is there, in a country where the average person doesn&rsquo;t have a telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I should have stopped then, but something   &mdash;   the certainty in this brother&rsquo;s voice, maybe, or our rough resemblance, like looking at a foggy mirror   &mdash;   made me want to push harder. I asked, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you ever feel like you might be losing something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark put down his knife and fork, and for the first time that afternoon his eyes looked straight into mine. &#8220;I understand what you are getting at,&#8221; he said flatly. &#8220;You think that somehow I&rsquo;m cut off from my roots, that sort of thing.&#8221; He wiped his mouth and dropped the napkin onto his plate. &#8220;Well, you&rsquo;re right. At a certain point, I made a decision not to think who my real father was. He was dead to me even when he was alive. I knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife or children. That was enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It made you mad?&#8221;   &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Not mad. Just numb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that doesn&rsquo;t bother you? Being numb, I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Towards him, no. Other things move me. Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies. Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets. I know   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not what an African is supposed to care about. But who&rsquo;s to tell me what I should and shouldn&rsquo;t care about? Understand, I&rsquo;m not ashamed of being Kenyan. I just don&rsquo;t ask myself a lot of questions about what means. About who I really am.&#8221; He shrugged. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe I should. I can acknowledge the possibility that if I looked more fully at myself, I would .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the briefest moment I sensed Mark hesitate, like a climber losing his footing. Then, almost immediately, he regained his composure and waved for the check.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&rsquo;s certain is that I don&rsquo;t need the stress. Life&rsquo;s hard enough without all that excess baggage.&#8221; (DMF, pp. 343&ndash;44.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Mr. Obama claims that racial agonizing knocked his love-life off course. Here he is talking to his half-sister Auma:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was a woman in New York that I loved. She was white. She had dark hair, and specks of green in her eyes. Her voice sounded like a wind chime. We saw each other for almost a year. On the weekends, mostly. Sometimes in her apartment, sometimes in mine. You know how you can fall into your own private world? Just two people, hidden and warm. Your own language. Your own customs. That&rsquo;s how it was.
<p>&#8220;Anyway, one weekend she invited me to her family&rsquo;s country house. The parents were there, and they were very nice, very gracious. It was autumn, beautiful, with woods all around us, and we paddled a canoe across this round, icy lake full of small gold leaves that collected along the shore. The family knew every inch of the land. They know how the hills had formed, how the glacial drifts had created the land, the names of the earliest white settlers   &mdash;   their ancestors   &mdash;   and before that, the names of the Indians who&rsquo;d once hunted the land. The house was very old, her grandfather&rsquo;s house. He had inherited it from his grandfather. The library was filled with old books and pictures of the grandfather with famous people he had known   &mdash;   presidents, diplomats, industrialists. There was this tremendous gravity to the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Standing in that room, I realized that our two worlds, my friend&rsquo;s and mine, were as distant from each other as Kenya is from Germany. And I knew that if we stayed together I&rsquo;d eventually live in hers. After all, I&rsquo;d been doing it most of my life. Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shrugged. &#8220;I pushed her away. We started to fight. We started thinking about the future, and it pressed in on our warm little world. One night I took her to see a new play by a black playwright. It was a very angry play, but very funny. Typical black American humor. The audience was mostly black, and everybody was laughing and clapping and hollering like they were in church. After the play was over, my friend started talking about why black people were so angry all the time. I said it was a matter of remembering   &mdash;   nobody asks why Jews remembered the Holocaust, I think I said   &mdash;   and she said that&rsquo;s different, and I said it wasn&rsquo;t, and she said that anger was just a dead end. We had a big fight in front of the theatre. When we got back to the car she started crying. She couldn&rsquo;t be black, she said. She would if she could, but she couldn&rsquo;t. She could only be herself, and wasn&rsquo;t that enough.&#8221; (DMF, pp. 210&ndash0;11.)<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>Despite his insistence that he cares deeply about his white mother and grandparents, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s attitude towards them is deeply mistrustful. He constantly views them through the prism of their whiteness and their, to his mind, inability to understand what it is to be other than white. (Mr. Obama, of course, never considers his inability to understand what it is to be white.) Here he is, more than a little contemptuous of his mother&rsquo;s attitude towards blacks as they are depicted in a film called <cite>Black Orpheus:</cite></p>
<blockquote>The film, a groundbreaker of sorts due to its mostly black, Brazilian cast, had been made in the fifties. The story line was simple: the myth of the ill-fated lovers Orpheus and Eurydice set in the <i>favelas</i> of Rio during Carnival. In Technicolor splendor, set against scenic green hills, the black and brown Brazilians sang and danced and strummed guitars like carefree birds in colorful plumage. About halfway through the movie I decided that I had seen enough, and turned to my mother to see if she might be ready to go. But her face, lit by the blue glow of the screen, was set in a wistful gaze. At that moment, I felt as if I were being given a window into her heart, the unreflective heart of her youth. I suddenly realized that the depiction of childlike blacks I was now seeing on the screen, the reverse images of Conrad&rsquo;s dark savages, was what my mother had carried with her to Hawaii all those years before, a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white, middle-class girl from Kansas, the promise of another life: warm, sensual, exotic different. I turned away, embarrassed for her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (DMF, pp. 123&ndash;24.)</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obama is cocksure about what he claims to have read in his mother&rsquo;s face   &mdash;   and his disdain for her is very unbecoming.</p>
<p>He also claims to love his grandmother, &#8220;Toots,&#8221; but she, too, is just another foil for his contempt for whites. A black panhandler reportedly asked her for money at the bus stop on her way to work. She was so upset that she asked Mr.&nbsp;Obama&rsquo;s grandfather to drive her to work the next day. He refuses.<blockquote>I [Mr. Obama] took her into the other room and asked her what happened. &#8220;A man asked me for money yesterday. While I was waiting for the bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips pursed with irritation. &#8220;He was very aggressive, Barry [when he was younger he went by the name of Barry]. I gave him a dollar and he kept asking. If the bus hadn&rsquo;t come, I think he might have hit me over the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>I returned to the kitchen. Gramps was rinsing his cup, his back turned to me. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; I said, &#8220;why don&rsquo;t you just give her a ride? She seems pretty upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By a panhandler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I know   &mdash;   but it&rsquo;s probably a little scary for a big man to block her way. It&rsquo;s really no big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned around and I saw now that he was shaking. &#8220;It is a big deal. It&rsquo;s a big deal to me. She&rsquo;s been bothered by men before. You want know why she&rsquo;s so scared this time? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Before you came in, she told me the fella was black.&#8221; He whispered the word. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the real reason why she&rsquo;s bothered. And I just don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were like a fist in my stomach, and I wobbled to regain my composure. In my steadiest voice, I told him that such an attitude bothered me too. (DMF, pp. 88&ndash;89.) </blockquote></p>
<p>This is classic Obama: painting his white, middle-America grandfather as a neurotically aware anti-racist, his grandmother as a covert racist, and himself as the shocked and sinless spectator. Of course, not even his grandfather&rsquo;s exhibitionist anti-racism is enough. After this episode, Mr. Obama concludes that however well his grandparents behave towards him he still knows that &#8220;men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears.&#8221; (DMF, p. 89.)</p>
<p>Mr. Obama often refers to the physical appearance of blacks and his descriptions are almost always positive: &#8220;Linda, with her dark, striking beauty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (DMF, p. 234.), &#8220;An African woman emerging from behind the customs gate, moving with graceful steps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (DMF, p. 207.) &#8220;They [Masai] were quiet, handsome men, their cheekbones accentuated by the fire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (DMF, p. 353.)</p>
<p>Conversely, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s descriptions of whites are usually unflattering. The exception is the white girlfriend mentioned above, but of course Mr. Obama had to say he had a beautiful girlfriend to boost his own ego. Here is Marty Kaufman, the man who gives him his job as a community organizer:</p>
<blockquote>His appearance didn&rsquo;t inspire much confidence. He was a white man of medium height wearing a rumpled suit over a pudgy frame. His face was heavy with two-day whiskers; behind a pair of thick, wire-rimmed glasses, his eyes seemed set in a perpetual squint.&#8221; (DMF, pp. 141&ndash;42.)</blockquote>
<p>And here are some white strangers:<blockquote>I flew out of Heathrow Airport under stormy skies. A group of young British men dressed in ill-fitting blazers filled the back of the plane, and one of them   &mdash;   a pale, gangly youth, still troubled with acne   &mdash;   took the seat beside me.&#8221; (DMF, p. 299.)</p>
<p>He was a slight, soft-spoken man with round glasses and pasty blond hair.&#8221; (DMF, p. 354.)</blockquote></p>
<p>When he goes to Kenya for the first time he finally gets away from all those white people. He is &#8220;going home,&#8221; and finds that<blockquote>a steady procession of black faces passed before your eyes, the round faces of babies and the chipped, worn faces of the old; beautiful faces that made me understand the transformation that Asante and other black Americans claimed to have undergone after their first visit to Africa. For a span of weeks or months, you could experience the freedom that comes from not feeling watched, the freedom of believing that your hair grows as it&rsquo;s supposed to grow and that your rump sways the way a rump is supposed to sway. You could see a man talking to himself as just plain crazy, or read about the criminal on the front page of the daily paper and ponder the corruption of the human heart, without having to think about whether the criminal or lunatic said something about your own fate. Here the world was black, and so you were just you; you could discover all those things that were unique to your life without living a lie or committing betrayal. (DMF, p.&nbsp;311.)<br>
</blockquote>Living among whites, in other words, is living a lie or committing betrayal. Mr.&nbsp;Obama does not consider the possibility that all races, including whites, might prefer a homogenous society in which they did not have to think about race.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Obama found Kenya to be not all he wanted it to be, with flagrant corruption and tribalism. The politically correct reader can relax, however, because this is not the fault of Kenyans but harkens back to colonialism, &#8220;when the lives of whites in foreign lands rested comfortably on the backs of darker races&#8221; (DMF, p.&nbsp;314) and left a legacy of psychological subordination. Mr.&nbsp;Obama illustrates this with a black waiter who ignored Mr.&nbsp;Obama and his half sister while he served white tourists:<blockquote>Did the waiter know that black rule had come? Did it mean anything to him? Maybe once, I thought to myself. He would be old enough to remember independence, the shouts of &#8220;Uhuru!&#8221; and the raising of new flags. But such memories may seem almost fantastic to him now, distant and na&#239;ve. He learned that the same people who controlled the land before independence still controlled the land, that he still cannot eat in the restaurants or stay in the same hotels that the white man built. He sees the money of the city swirling above his head, the technology which spits out goods from its robot mouth. If he&rsquo;s ambitious he will do his best to learn the white man&rsquo;s language,  use the white man&rsquo;s machines, trying to make ends meet the same way the computer repairman in Newark or the bus driver back in Chicago does, with alternating spurts of enthusiasm or frustration but mostly with resignation. And if you say to him that he&rsquo;s serving the interests of neocolonialism or some other such thing, he will reply that yes, he will serve if that is what&rsquo;s required. It is the lucky ones who serve; the unlucky ones drift into the murky tide of hustles and odd jobs; many will drown. (DMF, pp.&nbsp;314&#150;15)<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The same people controlling the land now as during colonial times? How about the post-colonial black elite? Did they decide to hide away during his visit?</p>
<p>Here is Mr.&nbsp;Obama deciding to serve his people by becoming a &#8220;community organizer&#8221;: &#8220;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll organize black folks. At the grass roots. For change.&#8221; (DMF, p.&nbsp;133.)</p>
<p>In <cite>The Audacity of Hope</cite> (AOH) he makes excuses for black businessmen:<blockquote>Few African American entrepreneurs have either the inherited wealth or the angel investors to help launch their business or cushion them from a sudden economic downturn. Few doubt that if they were white they would be further along in reaching their goals. (AOH, p.&nbsp;241.)</p>
</blockquote>Perhaps the most revealing passage on race in either book is in DMF, in which Mr.&nbsp;Obama considers the case for black separatism:<blockquote>In talking to self-professed nationalists like Rafiq [a follower of the Nation of Islam], though, I came to see how the blanket indictment of everything white served a central function in their message of uplift; how, psychologically, at least, one depended on the other. For when the nationalist spoke of a reawakening of values as the only solution to black poverty expressing an implicit, if not explicit, criticism to black to listeners: that we did not have to live as we did. And while there were those who could take such an unadorned message and use it to hew life for themselves  &mdash;  those with the stolid dispositions that Booker&nbsp;T. Washington had once demanded from his followers  &mdash;  in the ears of many blacks such talk smacked of the explanations that whites had always offered for black poverty: that we continued to suffer from, if not genetic inferiority then cultural weakness. It was a message that ignored causality or fault, a message outside history, without a script or plot that might insist on progression. For a people stripped of their history, a people often ill equipped to retrieve that history in any form other than what fluttered across the television screen, the testimony of what we saw every day seemed to confirm our worst suspicions about ourselves.
<p>Nationalism provided that history, an unambiguous morality that was easily communicated and easily grasped. A steady attack on the white race, the constant recitation of black people&rsquo;s experience in this country, served as the ballast that could prevent the ideas of personal and communal responsibility from tipping into an ocean of despair. Yes, the nationalist would say, whites are responsible for your sorry state, not any inherent flaws in you. In fact, whites are so heartless and devious that we can no longer expect anything from them. The self-loathing you feel, what keeps you drinking or thieving is planted by them. Rid them from your mind and find your true power liberated. <em>Rise up, ye mighty race!</em></p>
<p>This process of displacement, this means of engaging in self criticism while removing ourselves from the object of criticism, helped explain the much-admired success of the Nation of Islam in turning around the lives of drug addicts and criminals. But if it was especially well suited to those at the bottom rungs of American life, it also spoke to all the continuing doubts of the lawyer who had run hard for the gold ring yet still experienced the awkward silence when walking into the clubhouse; those young college students who warily measured the distance between them and life on Chicago&rsquo;s mean streets, with the danger that distance implied; all the black people who, it turned out, shared with me a voice that whispered inside them  &mdash;  &#8220;You don&rsquo;t really belong here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a sense, then, Rafiq was right when he insisted that, deep down, all blacks were potential nationalists. The anger was there, bottled up and often turned inward. And as I thought about Ruby and her blue eyes, the teenagers calling each other &#8220;nigger&#8221; and worse, I wondered whether, for now at least, Rafiq wasn&rsquo;t also right in preferring that that anger be redirected; whether a black politics that suppressed rage toward whites generally, or one that failed to elevate race loyalty above all else, was a politics inadequate to the task.</p>
<p>It was a painful thought to consider, as painful now as it had been years ago. It contradicted the morality my mother had taught me, a morality of subtle distinctions  &mdash;  between individuals of goodwill and those who wished me ill, between active malice and ignorance or indifference. I had a personal stake in that moral framework; I&rsquo;d discovered that I couldn&rsquo;t escape it if I tried. And yet perhaps it was a framework that blacks in this country could no longer afford; perhaps it weakened black resolve, encouraged confusion within the ranks. Desperate times called for desperate measures, and for many blacks, times were chronically desperate. If nationalism could create an effective insularity, deliver on its promise of self-respect, the hurt it might cause well-meaning whites, or the inner turmoil it caused people like me, would be of little consequence.</p>
<p>If nationalism could deliver. As it turned out, questions of effectiveness, and not sentiment, caused most of my quarrels with Rafiq.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (AOH, pp.&nbsp;198&#150;200.)<br>
</blockquote>So there you have it. Mr.&nbsp;Obama had no moral objection to black nationalism, only a practical one. As for the interest of whites, even white liberals, well, they ultimately do not matter.</p>
<p>Even if we did not have the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Obama&rsquo;s own words, his association with Jeremiah Wright and members of the Nation of Islam speak volumes. The Nation of Islam views whites as devils intent on oppressing blacks, and Rev. Wright&rsquo;s hatred for whites and for America is well known.</p>
<p>Who could sit listening to the views of the likes of Rev. Wright for 20 years without being in sympathy with them to some degree? Why else would he allow him to perform his marriage and baptize his children? It is also worth asking why a self-declared inclusive politician would want to belong to a black church rather than an integrated one and why someone who has a white mother, was brought up by whites, and attended schools which were overwhelmingly white would wish to immerse himself so deeply in blackness unless that was the only way he could feel at home.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Obama&rsquo;s current view of race is probably best expressed in this passage:<blockquote>&#8220;To say that we are one people is not to suggest that race no longer matters  &mdash;  that the fight for equality has been won, that the problems that minorities face in this country today are largely self-inflicted. We know the statistics: On almost every single socioeconomic indicator, from infant mortality to life expectancy to employment to home ownership, black and Latino Americans in particular continue to lag far behind their white counterparts. In corporate boardrooms across America, minorities are grossly underrepresented; in the United States Senate there are only three Latinos and two Asian members (both from Hawaii), and as I write today I am the chamber&rsquo;s sole African American. To suggest that our racial attitudes play no part in these disparities is to turn a blind eye to both our history and our experience  &mdash;  and to relieve ourselves of the responsibility to make things right.</p>
<p>Moreover, while my own upbringing hardly typifies the African American experience  &mdash;  and although, largely through luck and circumstance, I now occupy a position that insulates me from most of the bumps and bruises that the average black man must endure  &mdash;  I can recite the usual litany of petty slights that during my forty-five years have been directed my way: security guards tailing me as I shop in department stores, white couples who toss me their car keys as I stand outside a restaurant waiting for the valet, police cars pulling me over for no apparent reason. I know what it&rsquo;s like to have people tell me I can&rsquo;t do something because of my color, and I know the bitter swill of swallowed-back anger. I know as well that [my wife] Michelle and I must be continually vigilant against some of the debilitating story lines that our daughters may absorb  &mdash;  from TV and music and friends and the streets   &mdash;   about who the world thinks they are, and what the world imagines they should be.&#8221; (AOH, pp.&nbsp;232&#150;33)<br>
</blockquote>The kindest view is that Mr. Obama is seriously infected with the victimhood mentality. The unkindest is that he is an out-and-out separatist. Internet journalist Steve Sailer has made a good analysis of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s views on race and how they have conveniently changed over his political life. His book, <cite><a href="/half-blood_prince/half-blood_prince.pdf">The Half-Blood Prince</a>,</cite> can be found at Vdare.</p>

		<p>Obama says he stopped touting his mother&rsquo;s whiteness when he was 12 or 13.  That is about the age that children start to notice that there are generally differences between their peers of different races.  Before then, you can have an integrated classroom with generally little violence and little desire to separate, even if the academics aren&rsquo;t that good.  But 12 or 13 is when they start self-separating.</p>

<i>&#8220;I see the split-second adjustments they have to make, the searching of my eyes for some telltale sign.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I would describe this as innate cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>We all have the template in our minds for races. When we encounter someone who (and I&rsquo;ll be brutally blunt) doesn&rsquo;t look &#8216;normal&rsquo;, it throws the mind into confusion and it does take a second or more to adjust your thinking to make sense of the &#8216;abnormality&rsquo; before your eyes.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s describing is the healthy functioning of a perfectly natural and normal brain having to make sense of something it innately sees as wrong.</p>

		<p>It struck me, in reading Obama talk of his former white love interest, the one whose father lived in the historic house&hellip;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Standing in that room, I realized that our two worlds, my friend&rsquo;s and mine, were as distant from each other as Kenya is from Germany. And I knew that if we stayed together I&rsquo;d eventually live in hers. After all, I&rsquo;d been doing it most of my life. Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;So what happened?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>I shrugged. &ldquo;I pushed her away.</i></p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s Obama talking about finding it impossible to live in a white person&rsquo;s world. Isn&rsquo;t it funny that such a man has decided he wants to live in the ultimate such world, the White House, where he is surrounded by white people, white advisors, all day and every day? </p>
<p>WHY? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. From everything I have read in this article, Obama is a racist, racist, racist, if that word has any meaning at all. He looks black, thinks black, and lives black, he thinks blacks are the nobler race, and he ultimately has their interests first, last, and always. Yet he has to at least pretend that he is looking out for white people&rsquo;s interests as well as those of blacks. </p>
<p>How long can the pretense last? Can he keep it up indefinitely, or is it one day going to come crashing down around him&hellip;and us? </p>
<p>If he is as black-oriented as his writings suggest, the pretense has to fall apart eventually.</p>

		<p>As far as  the claim that Obama&rsquo;s book was ghostwritten for him by Bill Ayers, I don&rsquo;t know if a white man, even a radical like Ayers, could possibly have imagined such antiwhite animus on the part of a black man  &mdash;  especially a successful black man  &mdash;  as is shown in DMF. If a white wrote the book it would probably be talking about how the races are equal, there are no differences whatsoever, blah blah blah. In other words, all of the standard fantasies that whites have been conditioned to engage in for decades now.</p>

		<p>Everything about the Big Empty Suit is disgusting. I don&rsquo;t mind liberals tangling themselves up in their lofty, utopian foolishness, but to drag the rest of us along by sending Obama to the White House? </p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t believe Obama to be a racist at heart. To be a racist requires that one pick a side, and if there&rsquo;s anything that Obama&rsquo;s total lack of lifetime accomplishment shows, it&rsquo;s that he hasn&rsquo;t chosen a side on any issue, ever. (What kind of person takes their J.D. from Harvard and then never practices law?)</p>
<p>Obama, the Big Empty Suit, is a carefully crafted, Frankenstein-like patchwork of focus group costumes. Over here he touts his white mother and grandparents, over there he&rsquo;s a racially aware black, over here he wants to bring change, over there he recruits a longtime Washington hatchet man named Rahm Emanuel. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a front man for whatever liberal powers are driving him, the same as Bush was a front man for Cheney and his corporate raiders. I went to Iraq under Bush, now I&rsquo;ll go the poorhouse under Obama. </p>
<p>Getting yanked around by whatever man&rsquo;s in the Oval Office is a simple fact of life. At least Bush held the sharp end of the stick pointed out; Obama will soon be holding it to our throats. </p>

		<p>This brilliant piece not only gives us an insight of Barack&rsquo;s mind but also that of most biracial people. Their black side and white side rarely get along leaving them confused and most often it is their black side which wins. Most have inferiority complex feelings with respect to pure Whites. Many biracials are more anti-white than pure blacks. There are exceptions like Barack&rsquo;s half brother Mark. However this article does not mention the fact that Barack never spoke to Mark again because of Mark&rsquo;s belief even though mark was his half brother. That is why our wise ancestors warned us about race mixing.</p>

		<p>Does anybody seriously believe that this tongue-tied witless ninny actually wrote either of these black-grievance books? Absent his teleprompter he sounds like a babbling idiot.</p>
<p>Black Africans are unique among all the races of the world in claiming that their world is totally controlled by whites, assigning us the role of omnipotent but evil supermen who have somehow managed to subvert and destroy the inherent worth of the black race.</p>
<p>That we continue to listen to, nay, to celebrate this perverse interpretion of history and current reality is a blot on our collective character.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know that anyone contends that Ayers wrote ALL of the book or books. More likely they collaborated on them.  Surely Obama must have submitted at least an initial sketch, an outline,  to Ayers, and then later revised the final writing and filled it in. </p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t doubt for a moment that much of the writing is Ayers&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;m sorry that the writer of this article still fails to take note of this. It is the only flaw I find.</p>

<p>Children understand the concept of different races when they are around 3 or 4. At around the age of 12 or 13 they do have an awakening. At around 12 or 13 they begin to understand continual abuse of white kids can appear unseemly, and that it&rsquo;s not necessary to go all the way to violence to get what they want from white kids.  <br>

		<p>I agree with John, above, and in this, he is no differnt (wink) than the the departed Mr. Bush. Away from a script, he can only stumble among the thorns of his briar-patch mind.</p>
<p>Obamas chief strength is his Delivery, which is so smooth and polished that it creats a new form of revulsion to the hearer-especially when he throws in a few deliberate imperfections to appear &#8220;Folksy&#8221;.</p>
<p>What is most interesting and which bears most attention, I believe, is his use of the Dramatic Pause, which he uses with more finesse than anyone I can think of. Use of Dramatic Pause in Public Speaking is at the zenith of the craft. The Dramatic Pause has a function of inducing a hypnotic effect on the audience. It also misdirects their attention to the blank spaces and not the text.<br>
Please pay attention to it the next time you must endure an Obama proclamation. Then ask yourself if that is &#8220;natural&#8221; or quite conscious.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a sad commentary that no one cared enough to read the books and analyze them before voting. It is obvious from reading these that he is racist. Even if he didn&rsquo;t write these books, which I suspect is the case due to low intelligence, his having claimed them shows he supports what is written.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Then she started telling me about her father, who happened to be Italian and was the sweetest man in the world; and her mother, who happened to be part African and part French and part Native American and part something else. &ldquo;Why should I have to choose between them?&rdquo; she asked me. Her voice cracked, and I thought she was going to cry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not white people who are making me choose. Maybe it used to be that way, but now they&rsquo;re willing to treat me like a person. No  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s black people who always have to make everything racial. They&rsquo;re the ones making me choose. They&rsquo;re the ones who are telling me that I can&rsquo;t be who I am &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That quote reminds me of two friends of mine in college. One was born on Bermuda and was half-white half black. The other was a white, black, Hawaiian mix. Both came to college and were shocked to find that the blacks (black white mixes, let&rsquo;s face it in college) were expecting them to identify as black despite their mixed heritages. Both had a lot of friends of all races, but eventually caved to the people ranting about &#8220;blackness&#8221; and began to identify solely as black. They stopped hanging out with me and the rest of their white friends, which was quite honestly, hurtful to us. The whole thing seemed like black nationalists recruiting people, as if strengthening numbers. Believe me, if their white friends had discouraged them from making black friends, there would have been a huge mess on that little liberal campus.  <br>

Anon. @ 2:04PM</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what it is.  They want to recruit as many numbers to their side as possible. We&rsquo;ve seen the same thing right here on Amren, where black posters will indignantly  insist that anyone with one percent of black ancestry (but 99 percent white) is Black!  People like that used to complain about the &#8220;one drop rule&#8221;.   Now, they demand it!  It enhances their numbers and gives them more  power.</p>
<p>A black co-worker of mine used to argue that ALL  the world&rsquo;s  &#8220;people of color&#8221; are black.  That meant everyone in the world who wasn&rsquo;t white. To her, there were just two kinds of people: whites and &#8216;people of color&#8221;.   And &#8220;people of color&#8221; she considered basically black.  As far as she was concerned, even the Chinese are  really black. (The Chinese, I am sure, would be surprised to learn of this.)   This stuff came from her over-educated  daughter, who was in college getting her head brainwashed, and  was bringing all these trendy Afrocentrist notions  home to her.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius or even a terribly perceptive person to see that everything the Obama Administration is doing boils down to separating whitey from his hard won wealth and handing it to people of colah. Which is to say that Obama &amp; Co. are racist to the core. And yet when you post this information on a mainstream allegedly conservative site such as Pajamas Media, your comment (well, my comment) is deleted. I have little hope, in that conservatives, for the most-part, won&rsquo;t allow themselves to admit that the most dangerous reality they face, anti-white racism, even exists&hellip;for fear of being called racists themselves.  </p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s not only a racist,he&rsquo;s a nation of Islam racist! Put in the word devil in place of white and I think most on here could think of another black nationalist who might of had a hand in these writings.Just a toned down version. I personally don&rsquo;t have a problem with black nationalist if only they would go to their own homeland which they act as if its their only solution/dream,but as long as they&rsquo;re here committing millions of crimes against whites I do have a problem with them and fear we are going to see some Mugabe like policies in the near future.</p>

		<p>Reading the above reinforces my thoughts that the white South Africans were 100% correct ith Apartheid although over the years the effects would have mellowed as thye black tribes became more westernised.  Now they have been set back probably 100 years.  Now the whites are in great danger of disappearing from Africa as the racist blacks (not all blacks are racist though) rob or destroy all that the whites built up over a scant 300 years.  Consumed with jealousy at what the whites achieved in that time that they could not in thousands of years could not, not even write their history down as they had not invented the means except on cave walls before the whites arrived in te 18th century in sub-Saharan Africa, and they had not even built any permanent buildings or discovered the wheel even though it was in Africa in Egypt three thousand years ago.</p>
<p>BO is a paradoxical person who reminds me of Tony Blair, a good speaker from his university days, and Pres. BO, with his oratory skills in this case honed in the black churches with Jeremiah Wright as a tutor and the teaching in colleges (even his speeches often seem like lessons, how patronising) and now he is very concerned that whites have a history worth preserving.   </p>
<p>History will show IF he will be a good president so I will reserve my opinions at this stage, but Tony Blair and his side-kick have been a disaster for Britain and the Labour Party (Democrats?) will almost certainly be in opposition after the next general election.</p>
<p>I nearly bought BO&rsquo;s book this week but resisted the urge.   It is on sale here at a discount now.</p>

		<p>Not only is Obama a racist, he is a low-status person in the eyes of many of the world leaders he will be conferring with over the next years of his admin. The Arab popular concept of Africans is that they are no-counts, in America vernacular. Chinese similarly hold Africans in contempt and act on that contempt, openly seeking colonial control over that continent (they will achieve that goal, btw). I know that Euros will pretend otherwise but in the long run he is not one of theirs; he may be a brilliant outsider and a novelty, but don&rsquo;t expect real results from continental Euros in the cooperation dept.<br>

		<p>It sickens me to think that so many (white) Americans voted for this man. I live in the wealthy, white town of Chapel Hill, NC, and just about every other car and person is decorated with some paraphernalia of their cult leader, Obama. Little do they know, of course, Obama does not actually identify himself with these rich, white liberals  &mdash;  indeed, as has been sufficiently demonstrated by Mr. Henderson, he doesn&rsquo;t identify himself with any kind of white person. Sometimes I wish there was a better way to spread this message&hellip;</p>

		<p>Those who think Obama didn&rsquo;t write his own books (warts and all) because of low intelligence I&rsquo;m afraid are underestimating Mr. Obama. As Jared Taylor has pointed out, Obama is no ignoramus. Remember just because he can&rsquo;t speak without a teleprompter doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t write. Writing and speaking require two different skill sets. You have much more time to think and gather your thoughts when writing than you do when speaking. Also, nobody ever said Obama couldn&rsquo;t have benefited from expert editing. Again, I don&rsquo;t think a white could have possibly conceived of the anti-white animus Obama shows in his books.</p>

		<p>Many posters have noted, on this and other threads, that BHO is an empty-suited speaker, a front man for powerful interests.  Has anyone noticed the dressing down the Big Man gave the business elite last week?  Called to a conference room, a single glass of warm water at each seat (no refills for the thirsty), and a lecture, saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m the only thing between you and an angry mob with pitchforks.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m no fan of the business elite, but I&rsquo;d never expect them to be treated so rudely.  Where does a squirt like BHO get the nerve to face down these people?  Well, he wasn&rsquo;t facing them alone.  He had his handlers right there in the room with him, named in the news article, and I suspect that the men getting the spanking know better than we do exactly who owns Obama.  Will the corporate titans fight it out, with all of us as the pawns?  Or will the old elite give up and move to their private islands?  </p>

Thanks again to Robert Henderson for these articles   &mdash;   and especially for wading through two hardcovers&rsquo; worth of this drivel so I don&rsquo;t have to. Like many, I&rsquo;m sure, on the AR boards, I&rsquo;ve thought about buying and reading BHO&rsquo;s two books   &mdash;   just to find out what this guy REALLY thinks   &mdash;   but have been stopped by the thought that (a) it would really bother me to give him my money; and (b) both books look utterly unreadable to me and I&rsquo;d probably only end up hurling them at the wall while swearing loudly. </p>
<p>How wonderful then to have AR to digest them for us and present their most alarming and inflammatory passages   &mdash;   some of which are quite eyebrow-raising indeed (regardless of whether they were written by Obama, Bill Ayers, or, as I suspect, a combination of both). </p>
<p>The inescapable conclusion for any white person who&rsquo;s not a self-hating Marxist is (as other posters have noted), yes, our new president is an out-and-out RACIST. He does NOT like white people. Some of us he tolerates, a few he might actually like. But the majority of us he considers to be varying degrees of wicked. </p>
<p>That white Americans voluntarily chose a nonwhite president deeply hostile to them is something white historians will be analyzing for hundreds of years   &mdash;   assuming, that is, that whites will still be around that long. </p>

		<p>When I was a child race did not matter to me.  I did not care what color your skin or nationality you were.  If you were nice to me I was nice to you.  I was raised to treat people with respect.  The things that I have learned through the years about race has been by examples of each race.  Since we are focused on the African race; why is it that when ever &#8220;blacks&#8221; have had chances to run a government,country, or what have you that it goes to ruin??  Also, if &#8220;white people&#8221; are so terrible why do you choose to live where they live?</p>

<i> Barack Obama in His Own Words(I &II;)</i>  and the commentaries bring up the question of the extent to which BO is motivated by his love for Blacks as opposed to his antipathy toward Whites. He must know the economic damage that non-White immigration has done to his people, yet he promotes it. Indeed, he seems comfortable with a Black alliance with non-Black &#8220;people of colour&#8221; against White men and Western culture, in spite of the social, political, and economic issues that divide them from Blacks.I read where he was upset with his half-sister when she complained about Asians in Africa. </p>
<p>From what I read, this was the attitude of Obama&rsquo;s mama, and she did her best to make her son&rsquo;s as well. I think that she succeeded.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t vote this past November;the first time in my life that I didn&rsquo;t vote in a presidential election.I&rsquo;m not proud of this fact,but I saw no point in participating in this election.<br>
I had planned to vote for Mr.Obama.I thought he was the better candidate of the two parties;but then I read his book,Dreams From My Father.I felt such conflicting feelings after I read it.On one hand,I found his memoir to be rather bold and forthright.On the other side,there were too many sections in the book that were downright disturbing,some of which are quoted in the above article.(The part where Barack talks about going to see a showing of Black Orpheus  &mdash;  his mother&rsquo;s favorite film  &mdash;   w/ his mother and sister still makes my jaw drop.When you&rsquo;re reading the book,you get the impression that Barack is always sizing everyone up  &mdash;  usually in the worst way.Even the people closest to him.Less of an example of a critical thinker,and more of a display of arrogance and supposition. And yes, everything is filtered through racial lens.His antipathy for Conrad&rsquo;s Heart of Darkness is downright funny,though.That comes up several times in the book.Barak really hates that novel.LOL. ) The image I was seeing on TV and person who wrote this book didn&rsquo;t mesh. I just could not in good conscience vote for the man(too many nagging doubts).Or anyone else for that matter  &mdash;  terrible choices.</p>
<p>I do think Dreams From My Father gives us some insight into Mr. Obama&rsquo;s personality We have to remember that he wrote it when he was 33 yrs. old,before he entered politics.So,in contrast to his other book,the Audacity of Hope,it&rsquo;s an unguarded glimpse into his mind.We still don&rsquo;t know a lot about Pres. Obama,but I believe by the end of four years we&rsquo;ll know who he really is.(&#8220;Even the President of the United States sometimes has to stand naked.&#8221; Might be paraphrasing Dylan a little bit there.)</p>
<p>When I think of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s popularity in Europe,I&rsquo;m reminded of what he wrote in Dreams From My Father(Barack had a two week layover in Europe on route to Kenya).He mentions that during his stay there that he felt &#8220;edgy,defensive,hesitant with strangers&hellip;by the end of the first week or so,I realized that I&rsquo;d made a mistake.It wasn&rsquo;t that Europe wasn&rsquo;t beautiful;everything was just as I imagined it.It just wasn&rsquo;t mine&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>  Balack Odummy is another low-life Washington puppet. He can&rsquo;t even communicate with the people without a teleprompter. He has nothing to say because he is a puppet of the New World Order. He gets his marching orders the same way the past 12 or 13 presidents have gotten them. He will not do anything without the consent of his masters. All the presidential election is about, is whom will be the best whore for the new world order&rsquo;s agenda. Does anybody really think their vote counts, anymore? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still vote in every election that come up, national, state, county, city, etc. Do I really think my vote counts for anything? No, I don&rsquo;t. We are still a country with a white majority, and yet, all new laws and legislation is geared toward protecting and enhancing the lives of minorities. I am sick of it. And then you have talking heads like Glenn Beck saying that we would do a disservice to our great country if we lashed out against the government. He and Sean Hannity have shown their true colors. Sean Hannity will say anything for ratings. He proved it when he tried to butcher Ron Paul last year on the election campaign trail. Hannity knew good and well that McCain didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. Balack Odummy will do whatever it takes to secure his own future and the future of HIS people. </p>

		<p>Hello Anonymous,</p>
<p>Your last post is interesting to say the least Sir. You seem to still believe in this system. We White nationalists shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking in terms of &#8220;elections&#8221; anymore. We should be thinking in terms of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s dictum that we need a revolution every twenty years or so. We&rsquo;re long overdo on that score. Take care and have a good day.</p>

		<p>Oh come on guys, don&rsquo;t you know that you must be mistaken. Blacks are never racist. That is only a white atribute. And blacks of course have little choice in their behavior when held down by whites. Not sure how but I am quite sure that my quiet, hardworking life in the Midwest must be the cause for at least a few cases of single, crackhead mothers to abandon their crack babies to the state, and pursue the strong black thug whose only future is theft, murder, and prison. Not sure how my choices effect that, but it must be true. Thank goodness BHO and his horse-faced wife are here to save us with reckless spending and pointless social handouts. <br>
On another note, I was physically ill after he won the election that night. I was in shock that such an incompetant, inexperienced, racist fool had easily brainwashed our nation into going along with a vauge platform of &#8220;change&#8221; with lofty retoric but few details. Although I felt that Mr. McCain ran a weak campaign, I could have never imagined the foolishness displayed in the voting booths by the American people that day. It was no surprise that osama walked away with 96 percent of the black vote (but that&rsquo;s not racist of course) but what did suprise me was the level of white guilt that has been shoved down our throats and how that affected the white vote.<br>
Be careful what you wish for. As my father told me, if you burn your butt, you gotta sit on the blister. I fear this wound will be quite sore for the next four years. I pray for us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s a front man for whatever liberal powers are driving him, the same as Bush was a front man for Cheney and his corporate raiders. I went to Iraq under Bush, now I&rsquo;ll go the poorhouse under Obama.&#8221; Quiet Professional </p>
<p>  He is indeed. Barak Obama&rsquo;s entire career has been orchestrated by our privileged elite. His rise to the top from obscurity has been masterfully done.  I think they knew the bust was coming and wanted someone beyond reproach to be president, someone who could be easily manipulated. Make no mistake about it our elites are both distrustful and frightened by the average white American. What his handlers may not have counted on is  his streak of independence that could lead to unpredictability, particularly in international affairs.  </p>

		<p>We need to get Obama out of the White House. This guy is a disgrace, never mind the article, it is the direction (rather mis-direction) he is taking the country in. If he lasts the 4 years, we need to send a message and vote him out in a landslide.</p>

		<p>Despite his calls for communism and collectivism, Obama is a man much consumed with enjoying a luxurious lifestyle for himself. Witness the ostentatious home that he purchased with the assistance of the convicted felon Antonin &#8220;Tony&#8221; Rezko. Obama has five bathrooms and a wine cellar in his personal residence. He is probably tickled that the home was commissioned and built originally for a white property owner many decades ago. </p>
<p>Why are the &#8220;Obama&#8221; books so consumed with race related issues? One has to consider that this opportunist was completely orientated to self-advancement at all times. He needed to prove his racial bona fides because originally the career path that he selected was that of becoming a lifelong politician, not unlike Adam Clayton Powell or William Levi Dawson. It was no accident that he chose to work in Chicago where the political leadership of the historically black political districts was far more fluid than in New York or elsewhere. </p>
<p>Due to the weakness, greed and stupidity of some of the ghetto politicians in Chicago, no dominant black political leader has emerged since Bill Dawson died. Had Obama succeeded in defeating Representative Bobby Rush, he&rsquo;d probably be content to be a Congressional lifer, but that plan backfired on him (Rush attacked Obama as a carpetbagger, a do nothing, and as insufficiently black).</p>
<p>His ascension to the US Senate and the Presidency has more to do with his white socialist handlers than anything to do with Obama himself. </p>

		<p>This is very, very sad. <br>
But think, really, how could Obama feel any other way?<br>
His narrative describes accurately, I presume, the tragic experience of being of mixed-race.<br>
Even when he is fully accepted by whites as an individual person, he still is self-conscious and feels the anguished confusion.<br>
This dilemma can only be prevented in the future by prohibition of race-mixing. This is the most natural, logical and humane thing to do.</p>
