<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/nyregion/13paterson.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global-home">Black Voters Waver on Support for Paterson</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Confessore, New York Times, April 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a sign of just how far Mr. Paterson&rsquo;s fortunes have fallen, the governor now faces growing doubts from a group that has been among his most loyal: black elected officials, clergy members and voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [Black voters] cited Mr. Paterson&rsquo;s efforts to remake himself as a moderate, fiscally conservative politician, a break from his beginnings as a liberal Democrat and defender of social programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, fewer than half of black voters in the state approve of how the governor is handling his job, down from two-thirds last summer, reflecting a broader decline among his core constituencies, including Democrats and New York City voters.</p>

<p>Although there&rsquo;s grumbling now that they&rsquo;re not going to get the pay-off they expected from the brother, all that matters is that he&rsquo;s black. When he runs for re-election, black support will near 100%.</p>

			<p>Is there any better proof that blacks support their race over everything and everyone else?</p>
<p>Is there any better proof that we are two countries:  White and black?</p>
<p>And, is there any better proof that blacks do not want equality nor assimilation but power and control?</p>
<p>Is there anyone, besides poor white left-wing mental cases who really believe in a rainbow utopia?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be either a peaceful separation or a violent one, but there WILL be separation in either case.</p>

			<p> cited Mr. Paterson&rsquo;s efforts to remake himself as a moderate, fiscally conservative politician,</p>
<p>PC dictionary defines this statement:: no longer willing to support give away programs to blacks if it means his job.</p>

			<p>Oh trust me, if Paterson decides to run for re-election and runs against a White guy, all the blacks will vote for him reguardless of any &#8220;differences&#8221; they might have with him.</p>

			<p>This is the Times so the whole article is a lie. Blacks will vote for Paterson in the 90 plus percentile because he&rsquo;s black and a big big spender. Only in Timesworld could the likes of never cut a government program Paterson be called fiscally conservative.</p>

			<p>These are people who live in violent ghettos and eat McDonald&rsquo;s everyday because healthy food is &#8220;too expensive,&#8221; yet manage to have the biggest and most expensive cars and tons of &#8220;bling.&#8221; Why on Earth would they approve of fiscal conservatism?</p>

			<p>Fiscal conservative?  What would he have to spend for them to call him a liberal?</p>
<p>In related news, Patterson looks like he&rsquo;s going to hide behind the race card in what seems to be an uphill fight to win election in his own right in 2010.  I can see it now   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s going to hurl the &#8220;r&#8221; word at any of his critics, and the blacks will rally around him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this story.  I think it&rsquo;s all a NY Times effort to make Patterson appear moderate to sucker white people to vote for him.</p>

			<p>To his credit, Paterson has been more fiscally responsible than most Democrats.</p>
<p>As the article points out, this is deeply unsettling to black New Yorkers who are always begging for more handouts.</p>
<p>They want Paterson and Obama to increase taxes and porkbarrel spending until the US is just like Haiti and Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>This is going to be a whole lot of fun if A.G. Andrew Cuomo decides to take on Patterson in a primary next year. He is going to think back to the fiasco he went through in 2002 against another black, Carl Mc Call, in that primary. This stuff is so sweet when you get to sit back and watch these Super White Liberals get eaten and destroyed by the monster they helped create. It just makes you wish both sides could lose.</p>

			<p>Paterson is no better or worse than the usual politicians we get here.  Naturally with the financial collapse tax revenues are down (as much as liberals and populists love to bash those &#8220;Masters of the Universes&#8221;, they sure love to collect tax dollars from them).  So Paterson is raising our taxes in a recession, rather than give public employees the same raise that I got this year   &mdash;   0%.  I&rsquo;m not happy with this, but I have no illusions that a white Democrat would be any better.  (We always get Democrats here.  Our &#8220;Republicans&#8221; are Democrats, such as mayor Michael Bloomberg.)</p>
