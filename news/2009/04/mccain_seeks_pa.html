<h1>McCain Seeks Pardon for First Black Champ</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frederic J. Frommer, AP, April 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. John McCain said Wednesday he&rsquo;s sure that President Barack Obama &#8220;will be more than eager&#8221; to pardon the late black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, who was sent to prison nearly a century ago because of his romantic ties with a white woman.</p>
<p>Appearing with three of Johnson&rsquo;s family members and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., McCain unveiled a resolution urging a presidential pardon for Johnson, who was convicted in 1913 of violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for immoral purposes. The law has since been heavily amended, but has not been repealed.</p>
<p>McCain, R-Ariz., said he planned to speak to Obama about it, but added, &#8220;I think the last person I have to convince probably is President Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to erase this act of racism which sent an American citizen to prison on a trumped-up charge,&#8221; McCain said, adding, &#8220;I have great confidence this president will be more than eager to sign this legislation and pardon Jack Johnson.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The resolution announced Wednesday seeks a pardon that acknowledges Johnson&rsquo;s career and reputation were wronged &#8220;by a racially motivated conviction prompted by his success in the boxing ring and his relationship with white women.&#8221; Similar resolutions offered in 2004 and last year failed to pass both chambers of Congress.</p>
<p>Burns [filmmaker Ken Burns, who directed &#8220;Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson&#8221; (2005)] helped form the Committee to Pardon Jack Johnson, which filed a petition with the Justice Department in 2004 that was never acted on. He called Johnson &#8220;the greatest boxer of all time,&#8221; and said when Johnson proved unbeatable in the ring, &#8220;the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called a pardon for Johnson &#8220;just a question of justice, which is not only blind, but color-blind,&#8221; adding, &#8220;I think it absolutely does not have anything to do with the symbolism of an African-American president pardoning an African-American unjustly accused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson won the 1908 world heavyweight title after police in Australia stopped his 14-round match against the severely battered Canadian world champion, Tommy Burns. That led to a search for a &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; who could beat Johnson. Two years later, Jim Jeffries, the American world titleholder Johnson had tried for years to fight, came out of retirement but lost in a match called &#8220;The Battle of the Century,&#8221; resulting in deadly riots.</p>
<p>Authorities first targeted Johnson&rsquo;s relationship with Lucille Cameron, who later became his wife, but she refused to cooperate. They then found another white witness, Belle Schreiber, to testify against him. Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence. He tried to renew his boxing career after leaving prison, but failed to regain his title. He died in a car crash in 1946 at age 68.</p>
<p>Presidential pardons for the dead are rare.</p>
<p>In 1999, President Bill Clinton pardoned Lt. Henry O. Flipper, the Army&rsquo;s first black commissioned officer, who was drummed out of the military in 1882 after white officers accused him of embezzling $3,800 in commissary funds. Last year, President George W. Bush pardoned Charles Winters, who was convicted of violating the Neutrality Act when he conspired in 1948 to export aircraft to a foreign country in aid of Israel.<br>

			<p>Dang, fellow AR readers!  I think we all need to immediately subscribe to the National Enquirer!  Why, with this piece of news, I bet before the year is out, the Enquirer will be writing stories about how the McCain and Obama families are having weekend sleepovers, with the kids all busy doing fun stuff in summer camps!</p>
<p>And, Hey - all you white dummies who voted for John McCain last November!  Are you enjoying this example of treason to your white race?  Do you think McCain is aware of the 37,000 plus white females who were raped in 2005 by blacks?  Do you think he cares?</p>
<p>Answer:  No.  </p>
<p>He probably approves of it. And, if any white male were to speak out about it - I bet John McCain would want hate crime laws enacted to shut him up and maybe put him in prison for complaining about it.<br>

<p>Not in the Age of Obama.</p>
<p>Something tells me there&rsquo;s going to be an efforts to pardon every black miscreant who ever alleged &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rapists and murderers, it&rsquo;s going to be claimed, were found guilty or didn&rsquo;t receive a fair trial because of &#8216;racism&rsquo;. Then they&rsquo;ll be put on pedestals as &#8216;civil rights heroes&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Johnson was a was a woman beating low-life and drunk, he was the Mike Tyson/Michael Vick of his day. His &#8220;wives&#8221; and &#8220;girlfriends&#8221; seems to have been harlots who freely sold themselves during their &#8220;relationships&#8221; with Johnson. He also beat and abused all of these women. Johnson helped one of his harlots set up brothel and fill it with whores, so he was a pimp not just a miscegenator and fornicator. The government did not prove that Johnson received any money from his whores, but it was proven he payed the set up cost of Belle Schreiber&rsquo;s whorehouse, and I seem to recall he shipped prostitutes across state lines to work for her, thus subjecting himself to criminal liability under the Mann Act.</p>

			<p>The Mann Act has been changed so that it does not now violate the tenets of substantive due process.  However, many blacks still have a hard time following that particular law, as I found out last year:</p>

			<p> Jack Johnson served the 10 months jail sentence six years after he lost his title, decisively, to White boxer Jess Willard in a Havana, Cuba, bout in 1915. Odd how the AP described his defeats of Tommy Burns and Jim Jeffries in loving detail, but said nothing at all about his loss of the title to Willard. Then again, knowing the AP as I do, maybe it&rsquo;s not odd at all.</p>
<p> Johnson was a boxer who loved to rub his White opponents&rsquo; noses in it as often as possible, and to outrage White public opinion by his constant pursuit of White women. He was loud and arrogant, playing the role of what blacks themselves have often called a &#8220;bad (n-word)&#8221;. As to Ken Burns with his documentary on Johnson, has Ken Burns ever produced a documentary where he didn&rsquo;t tell us in excruciating detail about all the woes caused to blacks by us nasty old White people?</p>

			<p>To Anonymous:</p>
<p>Your post is the first I&rsquo;ve heard about Jack Johnson pimping for Belle Schreiber&rsquo;s whorehouse. Where did you hear about it, or read it?</p>
<p>If true, then that destroy&rsquo;s Johnson&rsquo;s claim of being hounded by Caucasians, when in fact, he was engaging in &#8220;white slavery&#8221;. And I thought up until now, he was charged with violating the Mann Act simply for dating and marrying a couple of white women.</p>
<p>To Wayne Engle:</p>
<p>There were rumors that Johnson threw the fight to Jess Willard; rumors that started almost as soon as he was counted out . That&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t hear much about it. Johnson said he broke his arm. However, there&rsquo;s a photo of him laying on the mat, with him shielding his eyes from the blazing Havana sun - his arm didn&rsquo;t look broken. The photo was shown on one of those &#8220;Classic Boxing&#8221; shows on cable.<br>
Throwing the fight is plausible, because Johnson didn&rsquo;t have to return to the USA, where he was going to be arrested for violation of the Mann Act. So he went to Europe instead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t Johnson should be pardoned, especially if he was indeed a white-slaver pimp. That makes as much sense as trying to get Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose reinstated in baseball, even though Jackson took money to fix the 1919 World Series, and Rose bet on games involving his own team, that he managed.  </p>

			<p>tommy burns was 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 170 lbs jack johnson was 6 feet 2 and 220 lbs. Jim jeffries was 35 years old and had not fought in over 6 years when he fought johnson. Johnson was defeated in his prime by a white middleweight (160 lbs joe choynski. He was also knocked out by a white man named jess willard and lost to other white boxers too.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that the government has many more important things to do than pardon Jack Johnson.  Of course, there seems to be an element in our society that are obsessed with rehashing the past and &#8220;righting&#8221; past &#8220;injustices&#8221;.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get too angry over this since Johnson, by all accounts was nothing more than an animal.  The real anger should be directed at the white women, who allowed him to control their lives, beat and use them.  </p>

			<p>As for John McCain, I&rsquo;m not surprised by this.  Yes, I did vote for him but only because of Sarah Palin.  </p>
<p>But John McCain is nothing more than a democrat wolf in republican sheep clothing.  And now his daughter has so like, had her coming out, like, she just wants to strengthen the Republican Party, like.  I saw her on Fox and Friends one morning and I couldn&rsquo;t stomach her at all.  She&rsquo;s just a bullhorn for her Daddy and his liberal policies.  Her goal from what I could ascertain between, the like this and the like that, was she wants to get more moderates to embrace the Republican Party - meaning, more liberals, until there is no 2 party system.</p>

<p>I would posit that the Republican party is dead or dying.  That is because they have been so obviously flailing about (appointing Steel, etc.) and can&rsquo;t come up with anything useful except a return to laissez-faire capitalism and tax protection for the wealthy.  Christian Conservatives need their own country,  Non-Christian Conservatives need their own country, Non-Christian Constitutionalists (me) need their own country - but all of these groups need their own exclusively White country.  The question is - can these White groups interested in White survival have their own country and not tear into one another once the other threats are removed?  My guess is based on years of reading and posting on Amren and my guess is NO.</p>

     If the states still had their rightful powers, all White nationalists could live in a White state that they found congenial.  We once had about a dozen states that had legal African slavery, and they were able to get along with states that disallowed the practice, until the abolitionists overthrew the idea of states rights.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Throwing the fight is plausible&#8221;</p>
<p>No it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fight for 26 rounds in the blazing Havana sun just to throw a fight. If you throw it, you do it in the early rounds, not the 26th round.</p>
<p>If you look at the footage of the fight before the KO,you&rsquo;ll see Johnson attack Willard furiously in a last ditch attempt to save his title before being cracked by a Willard right hand.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;I threw the fight to Willard&#8221; was one of his many excuses. <br>
He also lied about having a secret pact with middleweight Stanley Ketchel to take it easy, which Ketchel broke by &#8220;double crossing&#8221; him with a sucker punch.</p>

			<p>Jack Johnson began peddling the lie that he threw the heavyweight title fight with Jess Willard in order to cut a deal with the US authorities regarding his Mann Act conviction. Blacks accepted this lie without reservation. </p>
<p>Problems: when did boxing promoters gain sufficient status to bargain with Federal prosecutors?</p>
<p>If there was a deal, why did Johnson wait five years before returning to America? The heavyweight title bout with Willard took place in 1915   &mdash;   Johnson did not return to the USA until 1920.</p>
<p>Willard was five inches taller than Johnson, so he was unable to rely upon his reach to keep Willard away as he did with most opponents. Their fight was held in Havana, Cuba on a day when the temperature exceeded one hundred degrees. Willard knocked Johnson out in the 26th round of their fight and Johnson was struggling from the 20th round onward. </p>
<p>As Willard responded to Johnson&rsquo;s claim that the fight was fixed:  &#8220;If he was going to throw the fight, I wish he&rsquo;d done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there&#8221;.</p>
<p>Johnson was a low life liar.<br>

			<p> To Soprano Fan: Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard those rumors about Johnson &#8220;throwing&#8221; the Willard fight. I believe Johnson started the rumors himself to try to alibi for getting his butt whipped. Motion picture footage of the fight exists; it shows Johnson&rsquo;s legs slide down to the canvas from the &#8220;knees raised&#8221; position depicted in the still photo, indicating he was, in all probability, really knocked out. </p>

			<p>Personally, I do not even see the point in bringing up the old Jack Johnson case and issuing a pardon. He&rsquo;s so old-school I doubt anyone would even remember him or care.  I think these politicians should direct more energy to stopping sexual exploitation of women today.</p>
<p>I do not have any recent rape statistics, but as of 2005 I saw total of  148,110 rape victims.(111,490 White the remaining were Black according USDOJ) to  but before you spout something as 37,000 White females raped by Blacks you must also remember that at least 74,000 were raped by Whites. Also are Hispanic and Asian women counted among the Whites as the rape victims? And what about Hispanic or Asian perpetrators. (For example, in my state we often see Hispanics counted as White even if they are actually brown skinned) </p>
<p>Rape is a terrible  act of violence but you cannot always trust statistics unless they come from a reliable source. You must also remember false allegations are made, and many women fail to report their rape at all. Unfortunately, Black women are less likely to report their rapes for various reasons, and one could assume that in areas with alot of Hispanic immigrants of questionable legal status they may be unlikely to report rapes as well!</p>
<p>I am not trying to blame White people for anything. It is true that even though Blacks are less than 14% of U.S. pop, they are committing a disproportionate amount of crime. But the majority of crime they commit IS Black on Black. Since Whites are the majority of the population of the U.S. as a whole (74%)there are more likely to be more White victims.</p>

<p>NOT A CHANCE in (you know where), the blacks have a black PRESIDENT and he simply CANNOT do any wrong. Picture Mugabe, Mbeke, Mandela, Kwame Kilpatrick etc. etc. and those screw ups get elected time and again. The blacks will never give up the presidency now, Road Warrior days are coming. </p>

			<p>To put an end to the myth of Johnson throwing the fight to Willard, one merely has to look at Johnson&rsquo;s full career. Johnson basically won his title from an old man - same as Joe Louis, but no one ever wants to mention this. Johnson&rsquo;s career was padded with wins over opponents an average of 6&#8221; shorter and 50 lbs lighter. When he fought men close to his own size, he couldn&rsquo;t knock them down, never mind out and men his own size and larger beat him. Victor McLaglen, yes, the actor, lost a &#8220;decision&#8221; to Johnson but most observers, even the most liberal, felt old Victor had drubbed Johnson, but the fight was an &#8220;exhibition&#8221;. Today we have people re-writing history, saying it was a clear win for Johnson, even though they weren&rsquo;t there. These are the same people who tell us multiculturalism is good and that crime is down. Ok. Anyway, Johnson really didn&rsquo;t fight many good fighters. His most famous win was against Stanley Ketchel, the middle-weight champion, who at the time of the fight weighed in at 157 lbs to Johnson&rsquo;s 217. </p>
<p>We are being deluged with more and more boxing myths as blacks are being run out of boxing on a rail, although the powers that be in the US are trying to prop them up and rig things again as they did for decades. While blacks are fast and agile, they are not as physically strong on average as the other races, pound for pound. From 150 lbs on down, most champions are now hispanic mestizos, and from 150 lbs on up, 18 of 21 champs are white Europeans, with Slavic fighters dominating the heavyweight division, despite excuses for blacks from the US media and derision from that same media. The other Europeans have simply proven too strong physically for the blacks, having now realized that it&rsquo;s better to cut off the ring and concentrate on beating the body instead of a hard head. </p>
<p><b>McCain?</b> I think he&rsquo;s trying to pay back his handlers for getting him the nomination. Going to into the NH primary, he was dead last. He mysteriously rose from the dead, took the nomination, and his campaign made sure it did it all it could to ensure an Obama victory, working hand in hand with the US media which is run by Marxists top to bottom. But just losing wasn&rsquo;t enough, I guess he still has to do more to prove his loyalty to them and his disloyalty to his own race. What better way than to campaign for a black criminal?</p>

			<p>Yea,this is what our politians main agenda should be on.I mean our economy is in great shape and things are a little slow so lets pardon a black thug criminal who was rightly convicted.I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could compare joe jackson to Pete Rose&rsquo;s case. Pete Rose was one of the hardest playing ball players of all time and never bet against the reds.He had a gambling problem and dumping is a completly different thing. If he was black he would already be in the hall of fame,that you can bet on!He gave 100% everytime he played.</p>

			<p><i>Sen. John McCain said Wednesday he&rsquo;s sure that President<b> Barack Obama &ldquo;will be more than eager&rdquo; to pardon</b> the late black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, who was sent to prison nearly a century ago because of his <b>romantic ties with a white woman.</b></i></p>
<p>My cynical translation: <br>
&#8216;Non mulatto guy&rsquo; asks on behalf of/and for King mulatto to historically revise miscenegation as being moral.<br>
Something I&rsquo;m beginning to appreciate about how racism is percieved, is that it&rsquo;s the context that offends more than the end message, i.e. <i>who</i> did the talking more so than <i>what was actually said</i>.<br>
It proves how discrimination is a one way street, if your are assessing the race of &#8216;who said what&rsquo; to enforce political correctness when only whites can be racist.<br>
Ironically political correctness in trying to correct the white sins of the past, black slavery specifically for the US (the holocast for Europe).has made the masters and slaves swap places.<br>
Where the past charge was that blacks were supposedly silent in the white world, where as now it is becoming the opposite where only blacks can talk freely and whites have to close their mouths, choose their words carefully, show no pride in our group and be very apologetic.<br>
Even here in Oz when I talk to blue collar types who have been shafted/displaced with cheap foreign labour. I get muted facial expressions back that tell me that they&rsquo;re in agreement, but as a response I get scared, self-restrained silence back.<br>
In that hesitation is the fear of being labelled a racist and that conditioning has really taken hold in the last ten years.<br>
And thanks to the MSM most non whites have been conditioned to think that if a white person displays any sort of &#8216;racist&rsquo; behaviour in public, they (the non white) has the moral right and/or  obligation to commit violence to purge the alleged negativity.<br>
Like physical violence is somehow less evil and more justified than &#8216;bad ideas&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s scary how we&rsquo;ve gotten ourselves into this idealogical mess.<br>
The new master can now beat the new slave.<br>
To accomadate everyone, everything now has to be simplified, dumbed down and made into a basic, &#8216;one size fits all&rsquo; idealogy. With a large and diverse population our base similarities will be the only point where we all meet. And &#8216;selling&rsquo; one message from a corporate point of view is cheaper and easier that individualising messages for every single person also.<br>
Everything eventually trickles down to the lowest common dominator. The weakest links in our societies unfortunately now define us all. <br>
And in the world of law too, our knee-jerk reacting in trying to make the perfect society has worked against us when we assume that everyone is &#8216;potentially&rsquo; the same. <br>
We see the crime, we make the law to counter it. <br>
But when we have children running around who look like adults, to be fair we all get dragged down to their level.<br>
The failing in our thinking is in the expectations of other races/ strains/ breeds/ nationalities/ cultures/ groups/ people.<br>
It is flattering to say we&rsquo;re all capable of splitting the atom but it&rsquo;s just not true.<br>
Sure who wants to be part of the group whose gifts are deemed the weakest or most primitive, not me that&rsquo;s for sure. If I was told that I&rsquo;m a gorilla I&rsquo;d probably start acting like one too.<br>
So I can appreciate that it being responsible and it&rsquo;s polite not telling the slow kids that they&rsquo;re slow.<br>
Charlton Hestons line &ldquo;political correctness is tyranny with manners&rdquo;.<br>
And there are many ways of finding equality. You can raise the ego and results of the slower group with false praise and ommiting harsh truths while you lower the output of the faster group by taking away their positives and highlighting their negatives which creates a vacuum to be filled with the positives from the slower group. <br>
And you also ignore the numerous other gaps that exist between for example whites and Asians, Blacks and Latinos. In recording statistics add several other more boistorous groups to the white stats and/or stop recording other groups stats at all if they are unflattering. And if independent auditors gather these results themselves then roll out every &#8216;external&rsquo; excuse under the sun. That involves solutions that are too expensive to ever deploy 100%.<br>
And then if the victim mentality fails, silence the question asker by labelling them ignorant and evil.<br>
And then once you&rsquo;re really in charge, have the gall to call the vanquished, a coward!.<br>
So now nothing matters anymore it seems we believe in material things and feeding animalistic urges, and everyones equal, ugly people can win beauty contests, woman can have five babies of five different races without judgement, young people don&rsquo;t have to respect the old, our God has been proven to be fallible*, wars are scary so don&rsquo;t join the Army, be selfish, enjoy, consume and then drop your garbage because someone else will pick it up for you (but only suckers do &#8216;hard work&rsquo; because smart people work smart!) we&rsquo;ve really lost our ways.<br>
I was going to ask the question on another thread the other day about &#8220;what exactly was the catalyst for political upheaval/revolution in France or with Russia and China going Communist or Italy and Germany going facist?&#8221; Then I thought to myself (correct me if I&rsquo;m over simplifying or just wrong), imbalances in wealth or the hungry poor over throwing the rich.<br>
Is that not the situation we&rsquo;re possibilly heading towards now?<br>
Or will Obama trying to take away America&rsquo;s &#8216;right to bare arms&rsquo; be your fuse being lit?<br>
These mass shootings that occurred this weekend are really giving Obama the excuse.<br>
Ironically(again) the white guy who killed three cops (equally as disguisting as Mixon) was in fear himself that he may lose his guns, now his actions may be helping to have his fears come true.<br>
Interesting and scary times we live in.</p>
<p>*You&rsquo;d be surprised how much our media in Oz is still mocking S.Palin for believing in something and having some faith, yet us Ozzies have forgotten who McCain is already. And see Chuck Baldwins recent article at Vdare on how only 19% of &#8216;born again&rsquo; Christains survyed actuallly believe in the basic Christian dogmas.<br>

Since when is Mc Cain a conservative? He&rsquo;s nothing but a liberal RINO in my book. </p>
