<h1>10 Silverado Students Arrested Following Fight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beatriz E. Valenzuela, Daily Press (Victorville, California), April 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 10 Silverado High School students were arrested Thursday following an on-campus fight ignited by racial tensions, officials said.</p>
<p>Two large groups of students  &mdash;  one black and the other Hispanic  &mdash;  were facing off during the high school&rsquo;s first lunch period, according to Karen Hunt, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Victorville station.</p>
<p>The disturbance forced school officials to call in assistance from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials arrested four students for assault, two for assault on a school official and at least four other students for challenging others to fight, Hunt said.</p>

								<h2>Silverado Works to Tame Racial Tensions</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Natasha Lindstrom, Daily Press (Victorville, California), April 2, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Thursday&rsquo;s fight between black and Hispanic students is not the first racially charged incident at Silverado High School this year.</p>
<p>In early March, three Silverado students were arrested during a school lunch for being involved in what San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Victorville Station officials called a &#8220;riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Silverado Principal Art Sanchez said that incident was really just a fight between two students.</p>
<p>One black and one Hispanic juvenile were arrested for inciting the incident, and a third unidentified student was arrested for battery against a school personnel, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did have some racial tension earlier in the year,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;But we stayed on it. We meet with all the kids, we bring them in, we talk to them, we connect with kids and prevented a lot of (fights). There&rsquo;s a lot of racial tension in the community  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re not the only one.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He credits the school&rsquo;s two school resource officers, ongoing communication between students and staff and his morning meetings checking in with security personnel with cultivating a better campus climate.</p>

<p>Yeah, the police call a fist fight between two people a &#8220;riot&#8221; all the time, because both incidents are so closely related.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a typical dim-witted remark from a mestizo, thinking he is fooling someone into believing what he wants them to believe rather than what actually happened.</p>
<p>This high schgool is just one of over a dozen in the Southwest that are trouble spots for racial riots.</p>
<p>There are many others as well, but they&rsquo;re not in the news because the intensity might be just as great, but there&rsquo;s much daily turmoil all the same.</p>

			<p>&#8220;first racially charged incident&#8221;<br>
&#8220;We did have some racial tension earlier in the year&#8221;<br>
&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of racial tension in the community&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of having white folks being set upon called &#8216;racial tension&rsquo;. Or more likely: calling white folks being victimized, racism. White racism.</p>

			<p>I have a feeling that this will either be blamed on whites or they (the black and hispanic bigots) will find a way to &#8220;come together&#8221; (translation: gang up against whites).  Am I paranoid?  </p>

			<p>The results of forced multicultural-diversity is the best arguement for segregation. Remember when the world was self segregated by geography and limited travel. The inidcators of different cultures clearly demonstarte the preferences of the races/cultures.  Now, with travel/economics/legislation, once cohesive successful cultures are injected with social differeces they would never choose to live with.   V</p>

			<p>Well, another story on the beautiful returns from diversity and integration. Now if we could only get the liberals who foist all that nonsense upon us to live in that school district instead of their perfect wonderlands in the sky. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing for citizens to think about, as noted briefly in this article: school resource officers. The next time you say, &#8220;Where&rsquo;s a cop when you need one?&#8221; remind yourself that, in this town anyway, two of them are patrolling a school. </p>
<p>Think of how ridiculous that is - cops patrolling a school. And they aren&rsquo;t patrolling the perimeter, they&rsquo;re patrolling the student body. Imagine that: a school populated by children so prone to violence that actual sworn officers must remain immediately on hand. </p>
<p>So when there isn&rsquo;t a cop running purse snatchers away from bank machines, or panhandlers out of your parking garage, or illegals off the 7-11 parking lot, or spoiling the hundreds of other dangers that taxpayers put up with every day, think of the diversity-driven pointless assignments they are filling: school resource officers, community liaison officers, etc. </p>
<p>And the case for separation grows stronger&hellip;</p>

			<p>In 1977 I moved from Inglewood, California to Victorville to escape the black invasion of my hometown. I didn&rsquo;t think a small desert town would be in danger of becoming crime-ridden. 25 years later I moved again because I saw the same thing happen to Victorville. </p>

			<p>Why am I not surprised? A group of extremely racially conscious people square off against another? This happens everywhere in the world and simply points out the idiocy of multiculuralism, proposed as a solution to anything. Any and every culture will disintegrate if exposed to too much ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity.<br>

Yawn.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of racial tension in the community- we&rsquo;re not the only one&#8221;. So I was speeding, officer, but I&rsquo;m not the only one. I smell desperation.</p>

			<p>As low IQ, dimwitted bureaucrats, continue to control more and more of our schools, cities, and states, these are the results.</p>
<p>I should just reduce the effort and say, &#8220;our government&#8221; and every institution in our country.  It&rsquo;s all dumbing down.  </p>

			<p>I was a substitute teacher at Silverado some years ago, it was a nightmare. Literally, it was like a bad Hollywood movie, the &#8220;students&#8221; were openly contemptuous of the teachers and staff and refused to do anything. It is a waste of time trying to teach them anything. </p>

			<p>This will get worse. A lot worse! Wait until the economy totally collapses and then these &#8220;racially charged incidents&#8221; will ignite a &#8220;racially charged war&#8221;!</p>

			<p>Good for the Hispanics!  They will stand and defend themselves while white humans just bow in submission lest we get accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.  A whole multi-day series could be written and produced about when &#8216;they&rsquo; attack and we all know who &#8216;they&rsquo; are.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Principal Art Sanchez said that incident was really just a fight between two students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>It has been my overwhelming experience in the schools that the idiot Marxist bureaucrats who run these asylums will do anything in their power to keep these incidences quiet, and to especially keep them out of the papers, i.e. daily, vicious race-based fights, violent attacks on Whites or Asians, full-blown lunch-time racial riots will be dismissed as merely &#8216;a small misunderstanding between two students that will be worked out with mediation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Schools are also under tremendous pressure to cover up the aberrant behavior of blacks and hispanics  &mdash;  after all, according to the prevailing educational theories used today, there is NO difference between blacks, hispanics, Asians, and Whites  &mdash;  in IQ, temperament, ability to learn, and amount of self-control.</p>
<p>On the other side, the leftist multi-cults with their fat government-funded programs such as &#8216;peace builders&rsquo; will see an opportunity to swoop in and offer their anti-White services  &mdash;  believe me, there are A LOT of these organizations out there looking for any opening under the guise of &#8216;bringing the races and cultures together in peace&rsquo; (often meaning, getting the battling sides to realize they shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting each other, they should be battling Whitey, the True Enemy).</p>
<p>I have seen these programs in action and they are not only worthless, they are specious  &mdash;  stirring up further hatred in the name of &#8216;oppression&rsquo; and &#8216;social justice&rsquo;  &mdash;  code word for Whites are to blame for ALL of your problems.</p>
<p>In LA, blacks and hispanics hate each other, period.</p>
