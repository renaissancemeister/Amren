			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Carpenter, Washington Times, April 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Liberal actress and political activist Janeane Garofalo, in all seriousness, said activists who attended tea parties are racists with dysfunctional brains in a recent prime-time television appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s be very honest about what this is about. This is not about bashing Democrats. It&rsquo;s not about taxes. They have no idea what the Boston Tea party was about. They don&rsquo;t know their history at all. It&rsquo;s about hating a black man in the White House,&#8221; she said on MSNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;The Countdown&#8221; with Keith Olbermann Thursday evening. &#8220;This is racism straight up and is nothing but a bunch of teabagging rednecks. There is no way around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olbermann did not once try to challenge her on those assertions.</p>
<p>The actress went on to describe the brain size of typical &#8220;right-winger, Republican or conservative or your average white power activist.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Their synapses are misfiring&hellip; .   It is a neurological problem we are dealing with,&#8221; she said. This isn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;s offered this analysis, either. Ms. Garofalo said similar things about Alaskan GOP Governor Sarah Palin&rsquo;s brain last February in an interview with an environmental blog.</p>
<p>The actress went on to bash the GOP on MSNBC Thursday because it had &#8220;crystallized into the white power movement&#8221; as well as Fox News, which she said has captured the &#8220;Klan demo[graphic].&#8221;</p>

			<p>The most amazing part about it is that Keith Olbermann found someone more shrill, hysterical and paranoid than himself.</p>
<p>As for the tea parties themselves, I have mixed feelings.  I don&rsquo;t want to dump over some seemingly successful conservative street theater, but I also get the feeling that they&rsquo;ll amount to nothing, thanks to all the egalitarian rhetoric coming from the part of tea party organizers.</p>

			<p>Does anyone anywhere honestly take this lunatic seriously? Instead of a serious analysis of the Tea Party events, she resorts to immediate labeling. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s secretly bitter that her &#8220;Air America&#8221; network flopped and that most Americans are tired of hearing her bizarre and malignant rants. I&rsquo;m sorry, but the last person I&rsquo;m going to take seriously is someone who played on &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;. </p>

<p>Why should he have?? he and the MSNBC agree with her. As Jeraldo pointed out though, there was a decided lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; at the televised tea parties, sort of refreshing actually in the lack of loud, disruptive blacks.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;This is racism straight up and is nothing but a bunch of teabagging rednecks. There is no way around that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nice.  This leftist hypocrite supposedly denounces racism by using an ethnic slur (redneck).  Of course, that&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable, since it&rsquo;s Whites she&rsquo;s belittling.</p>
<p>This diatribe is nothing more than the pathetic whining of an ugly, no-talent, never-was who will say or do almost anything in order to get some crumbs thrown her way (in the form of tv appearances) from the powers-that-be.  She&rsquo;s not even intelligent enough to be original in her insults, since she basically rehashed her earlier Sarah Palin barbs.</p>

The cable comedians are still doing what they do best; mocking people and ideas they don&rsquo;t agree with. It&rsquo;s their ticket to riches and people are easily herded with laughter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still holding out hope for a conservative comdian. Denis Miller comes close but he&rsquo;s too esoteric and lacks popular mass appeal.</p>

			<p>Actually, the tea parties weren&rsquo;t racist  &mdash;  that was the problem.  If white men think paying a little more in taxes is the worst of their problems, they are in for a rude awakening over the next decade or so.  </p>

			<p>I like comedy and though I certainly have my prejudices, I&rsquo;ll laugh at someone from any background (racial or otherwise) if they are geniunely funny.<br>
And Janeane Garofalo is a professional comedian, who I have seen in several different projects who has honestly never even made me smile, how she gets her tattoo money is beyond me.<br>
Probably saves cash by not buying underarm deodorant and lady shaver razorblades.</p>
<p>In fact this is is the funniest thing she has ever been involved in.<br>
I believe she wrote, produced and starred in this scene.<br>

<p>And a few jokes for her&hellip;.<br>

			<p>Whose brains are small?  Oh, Jeannie, &#8220;Straight up&#8221; &mdash;  &mdash; NOT. It&rsquo;s, in fact, about taxation without representation, just like the original tea party. Jeannie talks fast as if she&rsquo;s intelligent, but a closer examination reveals that much of her copious verbiage is diarrheal in nature.</p>

			<p>These protests are middle-class protests and the middle-class is mostly white. It&rsquo;s simple demographics. Non-whites have no interest in protesting anything the government does because they are coddled and protected by the government.  </p>

			<p>The tea parties were a great thing for Whites. After ten years involved in the movement in one way or another I have decided on a more moderate approach to our problem. The &#8220;extreme&#8221; right is far too slandered to make any ground in this country. The next best thing as I see it is conservatism. What we saw on the tea party day was a grass roots coming together of normal whites, the exact people we have been targeting for so long in our fruitless attempts. Our people are fed up with this socialist government, but will never progress into our stance. There are more protests planned for May 30th and the 4th of July. This time there will be some press coverage and will be on a Saturday. Numbers will sky-rocket. Maybe this movement will blossom into another party. A conservative party which holds many of our values. Maybe with time we could get what we want. Or we can continue on the course we are as &#8220;extremists&#8221; and get nowhere. I just hope the &#8220;groups&#8221; do not clearly expose themselves at these protests and give the left what they want. A bunch of &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>

<p>He probably thought the dainty Miss Garofalo was being too moderate. It does go to show you how much hatred there is for whites in the establishment. Will anyone lose thier job for this? Will Garofaolo or OLberman get the Imus, Michael Richards, Mel Gibson, John Rocker, Fuzzy Zoeller, Trent Lott, Rush Limbaugh &hellip;etc treatment?</p>
<p>If you think there is a chance of this happening then I have a bridge in Brooklyn I&rsquo;d like to sell you.</p>

<p>Must see watching. These lefty reporters are very upset that not everyone is drinking their Kool Aid. Don&rsquo;t underestimate these tea party protesters or label them prematurely. This is something new happening in our country to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Here is something to really understand 100%. To every black and brown and yellow out there, your white skin is your uniform. It speaks for itself. Everybody seems to know that except whites themselves. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The world according to Janeane Garofalo.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly hard to believe that anybody could be so ignorant and dense at the same time.</p>
<p>I hope her and others like her keep up the denigration, along with Napolitano issuing more memos to law enforcement accusing soldiers and honest citizens of being milita terorists.  It helps us greatly. <br>

			<p>Oh, if only it were true that the tea party people would embrace white racial consciousness! Unfortunately, I strongly suspect that they are not ready to do that, and that this isn&rsquo;t anything other than partisan politics.</p>
<p>With regard to Janeane Garofalo, people like her, and the people who own and run the networks, are the reason I no longer have anything to do with television or newspapers &hellip; and I&rsquo;m much much happier as a result.</p>

			<p>Olbermann is a typical &#8220;want a be intellectual&#8221; who tends to frequent mensa like meetings. He proves beyond cavil that there is more to life than innate intelligence.  Keith&rsquo;s only ability is to generally be offensive to everyone at least some of the time   &mdash;   which leaves him in a perpetual state of job searching in the process.     </p>
<p>He is entitled to his own opinions but he is not entitled to share them with me.</p>

<p>I agree.  That they are being touted by the usual republican party flacks, like Hannity, is also troubling.  I don&rsquo;t want the republican party to just find a new issue to try to ride into office - I want a completely new republican party (one that&rsquo;s actually conservative).</p>

			<p>Keith Olbermann is what Spiro Agnew used to call a &#8220;pseudo intellectual&#8221;.  He desperately wants to be taken seriously but, alas, it will never happen. This pompous fool likens himself to Edward R Murrow, another leftist jerk/hero to the media cockroaches who infest our airwaves and newspaper/propaganda rags across the nation.  Listen to his rant against G.W.Bush on Youtube and you will laugh yourself silly.  He even ends his diatribe with &#8220;good night and good luck&#8221;. Really, this quarter wit in full regression thinks he&rsquo;s onto something big and maybe even on the fast track to journalistic glory, like, you know, Katie Couric, who just got a Walter Cronkite award. Oh man, I can barely type this without laughing. It is extremely funny how the empty phonies in the media and hollywood keep dreaming up new awards, statues, and trophies to give each other. </p>

			<p>What this liberal wacko needs is for a house full of loud black section 8 freeloaders to move in next door and an extended illegal Mexican family move in on the other side. Maybe across the street too, or for that matter the whole block. Then she might get the reality check she is in such dire need of!</p>

Back to the core topic of this story: protests over taxes, and a possible racial angle. </p>
<p>It indirectly raises an interesting question. <i>What percentage of blacks in the U.S. actually pay taxes?</i></p>
<p>It would be instructive to know how much of government taxation and spending constitutes a transfer of wealth from whites to blacks.<br>

			<p>I had heard of Janeane Garofalo so I was interested when she made a recent appearance here in Australia on the Rove television program.</p>
<p>I almost fell off the couch when, after claiming that she wasn&rsquo;t a political comic, she said to Rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;There will always be a right-wing in my country and every country &hellip; and unfortunately the Republican Party has now morphed into a super-hardcore white power type of Nationalist Front.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rove seemed to agree, replying:</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&rsquo;re all falling apart, that&rsquo;s the best part &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A super-hardcore white power type of Nationalist Front? This is how she describes a party whose leaders mostly espouse an establishment liberalism and who have supported large-scale foreign immigration?</p>
<p>I can only imagine that her logic runs as follows: the very existence of whites is as a social construct designed to secure the dominance of a privileged, powered elite; the republican leaders represent the privileged, powered elite; therefore, the republican leaders must be racist oppressors.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s a flawed logic is shown by how severely, how ridiculously she mischaracterises the politics of the Republicans. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a link to the interview with Rove below (the relevant section starts at about 4:00)</p>

<p>Well said, my friend. You beat me to it. Blacks WANT the productive members of society taxed and they WANT big government handouts. If Blacks are not &#8216;carried&rsquo; by a certain amount of socialism they will perish. Of course they will not protest this.</p>

			<p>If this isn&rsquo;t proof positive that what Thomas Jefferson said<br>
is 1000 percent true, then what is?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.monticello.org/reports/quotes/memorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.monticello.org/reports/quotes/memorial.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   The Autobiography</p>
<p>These are the exact words of Thomas Jefferson, and while liberals and egalitarians and race-deniers love to cite the<br>
first part of this quote, which I believe is supposed to be inscribed on the Jefferson Memorial somewhere - the full and complete text of his words are almost NEVER mentioned or quoted, and it&rsquo;s up to the individual inquisitive nose pickers to dig this up on our own. </p>
<p>Read the tripe that oozes out of this minorities mouth!  What she is basically saying, but you would have to read between the lines to understand it, is  this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks (and nearly all non-white minorities) love Big Government and we love for that Big Government to impose higher and higher taxes upon the productive white majority because this provides us with the redistribution of income out of white family&rsquo;s pockets and bank accounts into government entitlement programs which pay for stuff that blacks (and other minorities) are not talented or ambitious or hard working enough to obtain on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, she and her minority ilk define any resistance by those hated whites to the confiscation of the fruits of their labor as racism - since when they get to keep their income, blacks and other minorities then lose access to it and are then left to fend for themselves.   Hence, tea parties and their expression of anger over a corrupt government squandering precious tax dollars on big bank bailouts for crooked bankers or squandering billions on social entitlement programs that redistribute their tax dollars into the hands of the least productive elements of our society is nothing more than more &#8216;racism&rsquo; on the part of those stingy white people. </p>
<p>Well, Tom Jefferson was dead right when he correctly said that we are incompatible.  I would not hold out any &#8216;hope&rsquo; that eventually, blacks and other minorities are going to suddenly wake up one day and start thinking like white conservative people do.  This divide is far too wide to ever overcome, and the only solution to it - is to begin a peaceable negotiation immediately for a division of this nation and to separate ourselves by geographic boundaries to be enforced with a heavily armed border security force.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we have distinct and indelible lines drawn in the sand here:</p>
<p>1.  On one side, our side, we have a demographic group of people whose ancestors created this nation based on a strong<br>
emphasis on a strictly limited, Constitutionally shackled federal government and a definite priority towards individual liberty and states rights.  Such a government protects individual liberty, because the people living in it pride themselves on self-reliance and demand that the government stay off their backs, out of their paychecks, and out of their lives as much as possible. </p>
<p>2. On the other side, we have non-majority demographic groups - most of whom are not of European ancestry and who therefore played zero role in the creation of any of the Founding documents (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc.) - and these groups love an all powerful government because such a government will steal the resources from the founding stock and use that money to play the role of their Sugar Daddy. </p>
<p>As I said, incompatible is the only word to describe what has become of our Founder&rsquo;s America.</p>

			<p>Freedom is a white issue. Self determination is a white issue. Property rights is a white issue. Taxation is most definitely a white issue. Keeping our republic is absolutely a white issue. These tea party people are already being labeled racists just for being white men and women speaking out against this government. Think of this the way a black person would. Read between the lines a little. </p>
<p>When people persistently question whether Obama was born in Kenya, what are they really saying there? Are they questioning his real patriotism? Asking if he is really one of us? Alluding to his race? That is how a black person will interpret things. </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time we learn to see the world the way blacks and browns and liberals see it: racially. A white person asking questions about their personal God given freedoms: that IS a racial issue that speaks for itself. For those who think these protests aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racial&#8221; enough. These people aren&rsquo;t quoting Marxist slogans or anything alien. They are drawing from OUR collective culture, quoting Abraham Lincoln and people like him. Anglo Saxon Americans. </p>
<p>By the way, don&rsquo;t write Lincoln off because of which side he was on in the Civil War. He said blacks and whites can&rsquo;t live under the same government. Part of what northern whites were fighting for was the freedom to work and organize as free men with a decent wage without competing with second class labor (slave labor). Sound familiar? Maybe websites like this should quote people like Lincoln in big letters where first time readers will see it. </p>
<p>Maybe someone should send some of these leaders some free books some time too. </p>

			<p>Who in their right mind, takes this woman seriously?  She is a hater and an intolerant boob.  The only reason she gets any air time at all is because most of the MSM thinks just like her.  If anybody&rsquo;s brain isn&rsquo;t operating correctly, it&rsquo;s hers.  One need only take one look at her to see that she is a sad, unhappy individual.   </p>

			<p>The comments that she made are no surprise to me at all.She&rsquo;s been spewing this liberal garbage for years now. She&rsquo;s simply an idiot and doesn&rsquo;t even deserve recognition. But I think there is a deeper motive here. I&rsquo;ve said it many times,Conservative/Christian/White American = equals = Racist,redneck,inbred retard. That must be the first rule in liberal indoctrination/training.It&rsquo;s been going on for many years now,but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s getting worse(thanks to &#8220;D.H.S.Janet&#8221;).I bet their &#8220;list&#8221; is getting awfully long by now. The way the entire main stream media portrayed descent,hard working American taxpayers as idiots,rednecks,racist ect.etc.is truly shameful! At the Alamo Col.Travers drew a line in the sand with his sword.It now seems as if our own government has done the same thing.I hope our politicians in D.C. get the message eventually.We can only hope.Thanks again to you fine folks at AmRen for giving us a voice.

			<p>The no-talent Garoffolo obviously has a strong racial preference for the presidency as does Oberman. In fact they both want a black president because he is black. They both have been open about this. Liberals such as Garaffolo and Oberman their racial prefence is the only legitmate racial preference. In their world view, Native Born White Americans aren&rsquo;t allowed to have a racial preference.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is point out what Oberman&rsquo;s and this very unattractive no talent &#8220;actress&#8221; racial preferences are. Then point out that it is manifestly antiwhite. Then accuse them of being racist. Always through the racial charge back at them.</p>
<p>Oberman and Garrafolo hate Native Born White Americans. Nothing could be more obvious. Two self-hating White Liberals with no children. Oberman is a 50 year old multimillionaire childless liberal with a three million dollar bachelor pad in Trump Towers which he uses to make it with off-the-boat Carribean women(One of whom has blogged about her unpleasant experience with Kieth).Ultimately, they are two self-hating, pathetic and abnormal liberals. Of cours,. to write &#8220;abnormal and liberal&#8221; is highly redundant. Abnormal and Liberal are interchangeable.</p>
<p>I wish these Boston tea party rallies had a strong racial overtone to them. But in reality, these are just a bunch of foolish White Republican voters who vote for their racial dispossession at election time.</p>
<p>Garrafolo, by the way, has given the DEAR LEADER Barack Obama  a blank check to committ war crimes in Iraq,Iran,Afgahnistan and Pakistan&hellip;.quite possibly triggering events that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>Go to you tube and look for Ben Affleck&rsquo;s SNL immitation of Kieth Oberman. You may need medical attetnion after-possibly during-watching it. Even political Liberal SNL has got Kieth Oberman pegged as a defective. When you look at that picture of Jeannie Garoffolo, what&rsquo;s the first word that comes to mind:</p>

<p>You can print the decidedly supremacist quotations by Abraham Lincoln in big block letters anywhere you want.  They can be matched by Lincoln quotations almost one by one showing that he was a true blue racial egalitarian, at almost the same time.</p>
<p>The answer to the riddle is that Lincoln was a typical whore politician who would say anything to anyone, and say what they wanted to hear.  I judge Lincoln on the disparate impact of his actions, and that is the application of military force to enforce:  (1) racial equality, and (2) Federal unitary supremacy in public policy.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;This is racism straight up and is nothing but a bunch of teabagging rednecks. There is no way around that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently JG can use the racist term for white working men and get away with it.  Somehow it is not racism when whites are targeted.  Certainly &#8220;redneck&#8221; can either be used as a slur or as a form of praise among friends.  However in this case, white men are being insulted.  I doubt if the term redneck hurts their feelings though.</p>
<p>In the same sentence she used the word &#8220;teabagging&#8221;.    Look up the word teabagging on wilkipedia.  It is not worth discussing openly on this board.  Let us just say that most rednecks I know will not want to &hellip;.uh&hellip;.particpate.  Oh, and BTW, the same word was also used on Anderson Cooper&rsquo;s show.  Coincidental?  I doubt it.  It is an insult directed toward conservatives about behavior that is approved by liberals.  Now isn&rsquo;t that strange.</p>
<p>As for liberal behavior, I can say that it is elitist prejudice and contempt served sraight up.  Not only are our leftist adversaries bigoted, they delight in using sexually disgusting language openly on the public airwaves.</p>

			<p>This action, along with the talk by mainstream political figures for possible secession(especially of Texas)is very important. It breaks taboos. What before was unthinkable becomes thinkable. What has to be understood is the the action comes first,the motives come later. It&rsquo;s easy for the frankly racial motives to spontaneously generate once the furniture is in place. It&rsquo;s like writing a song, once the music is written, the lyrics are relatively easy to add. </p>
<p>The American Revolution was about &#8220;taxation without representation&#8221;. The Polish Revolution was about labor rights. The bigger revolutions were something that unfolded later, and were not inherent or necessarily connected with the earlier revolutions. The early revolutions put a system is place to grow from. Once again the favorable political structure and actions come first, the motives and evolution of the direction come later. Did Martin Luther dream when he made his protests it would lead to the the Enlightenment? The fact that White People could join together for a cause is a beachhead that won&rsquo;t easily be given up.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity, you are right I got the author of that quote wrong. It was Thomas Jefferson who said that, as Luke thoughtfully outlined above. </p>
<p>I was thinking that some racially conscious people should put together a simple flier to hand out at Tea Parties rallies coming up this spring and summer. Something low key. </p>
<p>Start with quotations from our Founding Fathers like Jefferson. Then some brief eye opening but factual quotes about race and crime, race and IQ from books like &#8220;Why Race Matters&#8221; to point people towards reading materials. Reader-1 has a great idea. Find some statistics to show who is paying taxes and who is not by race. </p>
<p>If you have some space left, maybe some jarring and nasty quotes from anti-white media figures. Quotes against white masculinity, quotes against Christianity, quotes against rural people, quotes against rednecks.  </p>
<p>Nothing strident or extreme sounding or with jarring symbols or pictures, but just some sound facts for decent, hard working people to consider about their national heritage and the future of their culture. Then wrap it up with some links to informational sites like AmRen. </p>
<p>By the same token, it would benefit sites websites like AmRen to emphasize that the message here is rooted in American history and traditions. </p>

			<p> Garofolo is a caritcature. We all have seen this stereotype. The shrill,loudmouthed aging hipster wearing everything in the counter-culture accessory aisle. Ten bracelets, eight earrings, piercings, the once trendy but now jaded tattoos and a silly political t-shirt (usually Che). They sit in overpriced poser coffee shops and opine about anything and everything. They have the quintessential opinion about everything political from filling potholews to global warming. They use the faux-educated hyphenated words from the leftist social engineering textbooks they picked up at the second hand store. They let it be known they know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>The left is not interested in debates, they could care less about the facts, they have a single agenda: The total cultural and political marginalization of the White demographic. </p>

Janeane Garofalo is 45 years old(born September 28, 1964) but she plays to college age kids. Hence she feeds them the ideas they believe. It&rsquo;s very likely she believes these ideas as well but she&rsquo;s a full grown adult playing the life role of a perpetual college age women.</p>

			<p>I will never understand why any serious media outlet would ask a marginal actress what she thinks of politics (or anything else). I have seen this woman doing her part as part of Bill Mahr&rsquo;s clown circus on HBO. I am not impressed with her trashy looks and her equally filthy mouth. If this is the face of the typical white Obama voter, we have little to fear. She is just noise in the background, which we have all learned to tune out. She influences no one but her few friends&hellip;..but seems to be used by several. She is a liberal stuffed-dummy used to frighten crows from eating the corn.<br>

			<p>Anyone who would listen to this arrogant fool and take her seriously as anything other then the moronic poster child of the incoherent but completely self-deluded Left deserves the likely fate which awaits him or her.  She reminds me of another traitor from bygone days, Hanoi Jane, standing next to a downed American plane smiling with the North Vietnamese &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221; of that period.<br>
The only qualification she has to say anything is her celebrity status, something which implies either nothing or that she is a deluded fool like so many of her famous friends.  &#8220;Beneath contempt&#8221; is an appropriate phrase which comes immediately to mind here.</p>

It is quite easy to picture this &#8220;Woman&#8221; sitting next to Stalin in a Soviet era uniform discussing whom should be put up against the wall. Seriously, think about it? If she had you alone in a room with three other fellow travelers (armed) and she knew she wouldnt be caught, you would be a dead man. This is Janeane&rsquo;s tolerance in action. She is pathologically angry, evil and crazy all wrapped up in an unattractive package. By the way, her dad was in big oil and her mom in the chemical industry. Nothing worse then the wrath of a guilt ridden leftist.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 11:01 has the right idea. The only thing I would disagree with would be to put anything about racial differences, like crime stats, on the fliers. That&rsquo;s for later when some of them decide to look into WN further, with whatever organization. But the idea about the anti-white quotes is good. You can open with Janeane Garofalo&rsquo;s quote and maybe a few other accusations of racism from well known figures- &#8220;This is what they think of you&#8221;. Then leading to a slew of the vilest anti-white quotes, from as many different non-whites as can be collected. Kambon and Guttierez and that hindu national guy with the age of the brown man to Lula blaming the blue eyes to BET and so on. Then something like &#8220;If racism is so bad, then why are THESE people getting away with it?&#8221; </p>

<p>That may be but whatever your strategy is it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working real well either. We have to start somewhere. We need to use the anger and frustration of these disaffected tea bag people to move on to bigger and better things. We need to find the things we can agree on and build on that. I would be willing to bet that most of the people at these tea parties, if they would be truthful, agree with 80% of what you believe. The demographic maybe white(that&rsquo;s good isn&rsquo;t it?) but it isn&rsquo;t all republican, although I think the so called conservative politicians are trying to attach themselves to the movement. Watch the video below of the people of South Carolina booing this parasite down. This needs to happen everywhere these leeches show up. Let them know that we aren&rsquo;t listening to their lies and deceit anymore and we want results not rhetoric. The swamp in Washington needs to be drained, one way or another. <br>

<p>Anon 7:13 thanks for the good ideas. I think what you are saying is that the way whites become racialized is by finding out the hard way that everyone else is already racialist. For the black, brown, etc activists, whites skin is the only uniform needed to identify their enemy. Whites need to turn that around and see that their white skin is their birthright and heritage from thousands of years of gradual development by honorable men and women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of something to encapsulate that, because most of us whites think in terms of noble abstract principles without realizing how unique to us that really is. Maybe a concluding line could be something like: &#8220;This is what they think of our Forefathers, but we are proud of our American Heritage.&#8221; With links to AmRen, etc. </p>
<p>Maybe a picture of an eagle or American flag or just a map of our country or a patriot like Paul Revere on a horse. </p>

			<p>Anders, tattoos were taboo to the Hebrew clans who wrote the Bible as a way to set themselves apart from the pagans and heathens.  </p>
<p>You say you are proudly bourgeois. That is fine and well, but whites do all kinds of work. Some bourgeois, some with their hands. Do you have something against white farmers or auto mechanics? Or would you prefer that work be done by blacks and browns? </p>
<p>Do you have something against whites willing to defend your homeland? Because many of these whites proudly wear tattoos. Perhaps you would prefer this be done by blacks and browns, too? In that case you are a more trusting man than I, because I wonder when alien protectors will become jailers and looters. </p>

It&rsquo;s very likely she believes these ideas as well but she&rsquo;s a full grown adult playing the life role of a perpetual college age women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This: dreadfully unwashed, fecklessly unkempt, and wretchedly inked perpetual adolescent, is only appealing to those who can understand her best, actual adolescents and twenty-somethings in junior high through undergrad in college. You know the types, they look and sound just like her (be they male or female,) and think they know &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real joke here being, that they usually know nothing at all!</p>
<p>The more horrifying joke being after that, is that some of these Red creatures do come to power, such as the deranged and dogmatic Al Franken!</p>
<p>As always, God Help Us All!!!<br>

			<p>A clinical psychologist with 20 years of experience was on the Laura Ingraham show last week.  He stated he has been listening to Garofalo for years and believes she suffers from a personality disorder that is deeply entrenched and lifelong.  He went on to say it was Narcissistic Personality Disorder along with possible Histrionic Disorders.</p>

			<p>The great problem for whites is that single white females and single white mothers look to government to be their daddy/husband/protector. Single white females vote Democrat by a huge margin even though the anti-white agenda of the Dems is becoming ever more naked. I don&rsquo;t see how whites can take back power and reinstitute relatively limited government without recapturing the single white female vote. And how can that be accomplished? Beats me.</p>
