<h1>Promises, Promises: Obama and Black Farmers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Evans, AP, April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a senator, Barack Obama led the charge last year to pass a bill allowing black farmers to seek new discrimination claims against the Agriculture Department. Now he is president, and his administration so far is acting like it wants the potentially budget-busting lawsuits to go away.</p>
<p>The change isn&rsquo;t sitting well with black farmers who thought they&rsquo;d get a friendlier reception from Obama after years of resistance from President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t blame it on the Bush administration anymore,&#8221; said John Boyd, head of the National Black Farmers Association, which has organized the lawsuits. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t figure out for the life of me why the president wouldn&rsquo;t want to implement a bill that he fought for as a U.S. senator.&#8221;</p>
<p>At issue is a class-action lawsuit known as the Pigford case. Thousands of farmers sued USDA claiming they had for years been denied government loans and other assistance that routinely went to whites. The government settled in 1999 and has paid out nearly $1 billion in damages on almost 16,000 claims.</p>
<p>Farmers, lawyers and activists like Boyd have worked for years to reopen the case because thousands of farmers missed the deadlines for participating. Many said the filing period was too short and they were unaware of the settlement until it was too late.</p>
<p>The cause gained momentum in August 2007 when Obama, then an Illinois senator, introduced Pigford legislation about six months into his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Although the case was hardly a hot-button political issue, it had drawn intense interest among African-Americans in the rural South. It was seen as a way for Obama to reach out in those areas, where he was not well-known and where he would need strong support to win the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>The proposal won passage in May as sponsors rounded up enough support to incorporate it into the 2008 farm bill. The potential budget implications were huge: It could easily cost $2 billion or $3 billion given an estimated 65,000 pending claims.</p>
<p>With pressure to hold down costs, lawmakers set an artificially low $100 million budget. They called it a first step and said more money could be approved later.</p>
<p>But with 25,000 new claims and counting, the Obama administration is now arguing that the $100 million budget should be considered a cap to be split among the successful cases.</p>
<p>The position  &mdash;  spelled out in a legal motion filed in February and reiterated in recent settlement talks  &mdash;  would leave payments as low as $2,000 or $3,000 per farmer. Boyd called that &#8220;insulting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boyd noted that Obama&rsquo;s legislation specifically called for the new claimants to be eligible for the same awards as the initial lawsuit, including expedited payments of $50,000 plus $12,500 in tax breaks that the vast majority of the earlier farmers received.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They did discriminate against these farmers, maybe not all of them, but a lot of these people would prevail if they could go to court,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I heard that case used very questionable logic, in fact I think I read it in the printed version of AR.  IIRC, it revolved around the fact that black farmers couldn&rsquo;t get loans and whites could because there were hardly any black farmers that were farming beyond sustenance. </p>

			<p>It seems every ten years or so, black farmers hit the jackpot with a lawsuit.  Most lawyers will tell you it is very difficult to sue the government, but the black farmers make it look like a cakewalk.</p>

			<p>This was a huge give away of taxpayer&rsquo;s money by Pres. Clinton to blacks that turned into an even bigger scam: </p>
<p><b> &#8220;Claimants did not need to prove that they ever actually farmed &mdash; or ever applied for a loan, only that they &lsquo;attempted to farm&rsquo; explains USDA&rsquo;s General Counsel Marc Kesselman. &#8221; </b></p>
<p>And they lied about that!</p>

<p>This is just shear corruption and blacks want that give-away money irregardless. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Black farmers want the money candidate Obama promised them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if they want money all they need to do is start a bank then go belly up and the feds will trip over each other trying to be the first bureaucrat to write a check for a couple of billion.</p>

			<p>What a shameless shakedown.</p>
<p>IIRC back in the &#8216;90&rsquo;s Bill Clinton shelled out billions of tax $ to black &#8220;farmers&#8221; many of them living in Detroit, Harlem, Watts, etc. and having never seen a tractor or livestock in their lives.</p>

			<p>Obama wants all blacks in white collared professional service jobs and out of blue collar labor jobs like farming that he wants whites to perform only in a race role reversal that is currently shaping up in a major way. <br/>
Zimbabwe wanted that too but it all fell apart under black rule as usual and in the end Mugabe killed or jailed the white farmers and stole their land so nothing works for the black race in the end other than misegenation.</p>

			<p>Looks like their new Black master has sold them down the river again. The Black leadership have been shafting the Black community ever since this country was founded. Today the Blacks still don&rsquo;t get it. Is this another indication of the IQ gap?</p>

			<p>Since the beginning of this debacle its been nothing but a giant theft of taxpayers money, just another dem scheme to buy votes, I&rsquo;m sure with the libs controlling everything there will be billions more passed out to these type groups, there is information coming to light now that some of the banks receiving TARP money are funding ACORN.</p>

			<p>Black farmers?  I&rsquo;ve hunted farmland all over this country (with permission, of course) and never seen a black farmer.  Surely there are one or two of them somewhere, just as there may be one at the Lockheed Skunk Works or NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but sons of the soil they surely ain&rsquo;t.</p>
