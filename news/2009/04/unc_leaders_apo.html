<h1>UNC Leaders Apologize for Speech Fiasco</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James DeConto and Eric Ferreri, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), April 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1963, state legislators silenced communist speech on campus. Forty-six years later, protesting students silenced a conservative former congressman because of his views on immigration.</p>
<p>The result is the same: a black mark on UNC-Chapel Hill&rsquo;s reputation for academic freedom.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, UNC-CH Chancellor Holden Thorp and UNC System President Erskine Bowles both telephoned former Republican Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado to apologize after student protesters shouted Tancredo down as he tried to give a speech. Students smashed a window a few feet from where he stood and blocked his face with a banner that said, &#8220;No One Is Illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident clearly touched a nerve, Thorp said. His phone rang steadily from the early hours Wednesday. None were happy callers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some were from alums, and a lot were from all over the country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t get anything from anybody happy with the way things went. The fact that it got out of hand is embarrassing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thorp has promised an investigation that might lead to criminal charges or other disciplinary measures. Specifically, students could be punished for vandalism and pushing a police officer, he said.</p>
<p>Thorp said he was disappointed the students didn&rsquo;t uphold the university&rsquo;s commitment to free speech and diverse viewpoints.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If he really means that, then I think the university should pay for Congressman Tancredo to come back and give his speech and ensure his security,&#8221; said Kevin DeAnna, a 26-year-old graduate student at American University in Washington who founded Youth for Western Civilization last year.</p>
<p>DeAnna works as a deputy field director for a conservative education group, the Leadership Institute, which paid Tancredo $3,000 for his UNC appearance. A month ago, the institute sponsored Tancredo&rsquo;s speech at American, where hundreds of students wore black in silent protest. Tancredo said those students let him speak, whereas their UNC-CH counterparts &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; nine campus police officers.</p>
<p>The American students &#8220;respected our right to free speech,&#8221; DeAnna said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thorp said the university will look at how to better prepare for controversial speakers.</p>
<p>Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in North Carolina, said the protesters&rsquo; actions amounted to &#8220;de facto censorship.&#8221; She had seen video of Tancredo&rsquo;s appearance on YouTube.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is disturbing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That video is chilling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rudinger said Tancredo has the right to express his views against mass immigration, just as students at N.C. State had the right to paint racist remarks against President Barack Obama on the campus Free Expression Tunnel on Election Day last fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Censorship is not the answer to hate speech. Hate speech is protected by the Constitution,&#8221; Rudinger said. &#8220;If we have the better argument, Americans are pretty smart, and we&rsquo;re probably going to win the day. That&rsquo;s the way democracy is supposed to work.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A rather refreshingly intelligent response to an opposing viewpoint from I assume - rightly or wrongly - devout Lefties.  On another note, as the economy continues to tank and nerves become more frayed, I predict more and more violence breaking out at these protests because, as Gerald Celente so intelligently says, when people have nothing left to lose&hellip;. they lose it.<br>

			<p>Again, if the UNC officials really were sorry, and really are contrite, they would find a way to break the tenure of the professor(s) behind these riots.  Mark me, there were professor(s) behind it, young people don&rsquo;t do anything en masse without there some being some old person behind it.</p>
<p>Anything short of this, and they&rsquo;re countenancing future such incidents.</p>

			<p>If they are really sincere about their concern about free speech, then they should put some teeth into their lip service, and have some real security if and when someone of Mr Tancredos caliber should speak on their campus again. </p>

I appreciate that Ms. Rudinger, director of the ACLU in No.Carolina, upheld help the right to free speech and found the  incident &#8220;disturbing.  It was! </p>
<p>But  I also find it &#8220;disturbing&#8221;  that she implicitly branded Tancredo&rsquo;s speech as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.   How nice of her to put the label on him!   (Did he even get to make his speech?)   </p>
<p>Anyway, since when is calling for control of immigration into your own country  considered Hate Speech?   Obviously, &#8220;hate speech&#8221; has come to mean anything the extreme left doesn&rsquo;t like and wants to have silenced.  If anything should be censored out of the public forum, it should be that biased term, &#8220;hate speech&#8221; which is just a slick device used to silence the opposition.</p>

			<p> I hope the university moguls do as DeAnna suggested, and pay for Congressman Tancredo to make a return appearance. And this time, two things should happen: The university administration should make it clear that the &#8220;heckler&rsquo;s veto&#8221; will NOT be tolerated; and the conservative students who arranged for Tancredo&rsquo;s visit in the first place should arrange for some security of their own. Show the left that it can no longer get away with these fascist tactics directed toward every speaker or appearance it doesn&rsquo;t approve of. </p>

			<p>The fact is that we have raised an entire generation of youth who have no idea what Freedom of Speech means, along with other Constitutional Rights and other civic freedoms and responsibilities.  They voted overwhelmingly Democratic in the last election in order to take power.  I expect that the road from here will be rocky and that some states, led by Texas will eventually secede from the Union.  But by then, the situation will be more complex and dangerous.</p>

			<p>The left has as its overall goal the belittling of the concept of the nation, to be replaced, presumably, by some supra-national ideal; but what happens is simply breakdown and little else. The left has not produced a functional society in all of the 20th century. Funny how no one wants to emigrate to Cuba.  </p>

<p>WHO defines what is &#8220;hate&#8221; speech? What the hell IS &#8220;hate&#8221; speech anyway, and when did the majority get to vote on its invention? </p>
<p>&#8220;Hate&#8221; speech means - any argument which proves the Left wrong (which isn&rsquo;t difficult).</p>
<p>The truth is &#8220;hate&#8221; to those who hate the truth&hellip;</p>

			<p>Ironically, Tancredo espouses a moderate, mainstream point of view on immigration.  He doesn&rsquo;t have a past affiliation with a white nationalist group.  He&rsquo;s a conservative politician from Colorado who, to my knowledge, is fairly PC.  I don&rsquo;t think he has once laid out that both illegal and legal immigration are destroying America, and that a majority white country is in the best long-term interests all citizens.</p>
<p>If the radical left can get away with silencing Tancredo, it&rsquo;s obvious that no alternative points of view on immigration will be tolerated at all. </p>

<p>Well, see that&rsquo;s the problem there. You don&rsquo;t have the better message and Americans are smarter than you think. Lefties know that if the better message gets out there then the real Americans will win the day, not the Marxists. So the only thing they can do is try to brand conservatives as racists to try to shame them into silence. They are afraid of a real debate in America, despite their posturing and claims that they support free speech.</p>

			<p> &#8220;When someone of Mr. Tancredo`s caliber should speak on their campus again&#8221; -Peejay in Frisco<br>
From the Movie:<br>
Female Voice in Crowd: &#8220;Papillon!, You`ll be back!&#8221;<br>
Male Voice In Prison Ranks: &#8220;No you won`t&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 Most things in life are either/or  I`m afraid. I don`t see a lot of people going back instead of going forward. Other events, other schedules and other commitment. I hope Mr. Tancredo CAN get back there otherwise the lil twits won this on. By my scorecard anyway.<br>

			<p>Parents looking to send their high school grads to a good college might want to carefully avoid schools like this one.<br>
It appears that schools like this one have been turned into factories for radicals and community and street mob organizers or as Lenin called such people, &#8220;Useful Idiots.&#8221;  A good trade school might be a better use of tuition money.  At least the students are taught a useful trade instead of how to attack and destroy the American economic, political and judicial systems.</p>

<p>I agree with your assessment.</p>
<p>Celente also had a word about higher education, which he reiterated just recently, saying that many institutions will be harder pressed to meet expenses in the following months, and many will reduce their curriculums to bare bones, while many others will close altogether.</p>
<p>This economic bust is probably going to continue on with an uplift here and there, during which time Bernanke and Obama will come out and tell us there are signs the economy is beginning to recover, as both did recently, then it is reported two days later that one of the biggest mall owners is going belly up; the housing bankruptcies are continuing, with the promise of many more foreclosures; housing starts are declining again, and lower overall costs indicate that last month was a deflationary figure, on and on and on.</p>
<p>CBS news&rsquo; Dan Harris declared that Schiff and Celente were the only two analysts in the country that were pessimistic on the economy, which of course was a bold faced lie, because there have been so many agreeing, basically, to their forecasts they&rsquo;re too numerous to list.</p>
<p>If the universities are forced to cut back severely in order to survive, I can almost guarantee that these kinds of disgusting shout down displays by radical leftists will be reduced to almost nil, and the disgusting blacks/women studies will have to be discontinued as will every other subject that has been added by the radicals who have taken over academia.</p>

<p>Those are scary words.  But I can&rsquo;t disagree with them, though I wish I could.  They are, unfortunately, all too true.  Freedom and democracy are not guaranteed. Every generation must be taught anew.  (But I don&rsquo;t mean in college.)</p>
<p>PS: Sending all those young people to college was a calamitous mistake. The only &#8220;education&#8221; they got at those indoctrination centers was a brainwashing from their marxist professors.<br>

			<p>Universities love &#8220;diverse viewpoints&#8221; by which they must mean diverse people of all races and religions espousing leftist ideology. Fred Reed has written about this before and he&rsquo;s right when he says that diversity of journalists will mean lack of diversity of opinions. This applies to any intellectual institution. The more &#8220;diversity&#8221; the more subjects become off-limits because they might offend someone.</p>

			<p>The left just doesn&rsquo;t get it, do they?  They can&rsquo;t even leave others alone to hate whomever they please.  I&rsquo;d personally volunteer to be an armed guard for Rep. Tancredo&rsquo;s next visit to UNC-Chapel Hill. I&rsquo;d love to see the faces of the lefties when they understand that they would be up against all three of us (to borrow from one of my favorite Clint Eastwood lines):  Smith, Wesson, and me!  Who would have thought this could happen in the Old North State?</p>

			<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that I graduated from the university, and from what I remember, they were nothing more than indoctrination centers where &#8220;Diversity&#8221; was the buzz word. We even needed diversity credits to graduate, as I&rsquo;m sure is the case now.</p>
<p>What angers me more than the ever darkening of this country are the Marxist academics and their white liberal students. That even though are numbers are dwindling, taking back the country isn&rsquo;t possible until this problem is addressed. The only bright side is that when race wars do indeed begin to flare up, these cowards are completely useless. </p>

			<p>Only someone who hates the nation could label concern for the nation&rsquo;s integrity as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.  <br>
The actions of these agitators opened them to the possibility of arrest for a number of things (assaulting an officer, destruction of property, disorderly conduct).<br>
More fundamentally, as conspirators to deprive Mr. Tancredo of his constitutionally guaranteed rights, and that, in the name of nothing other than opposition to our national sovereignty and integrity, the defense of which they find hateful, their position and activities, as well as their support for others who illegally invade and harm the nation,  are treasonous. </p>

<p>While hate speech is indeed protected by the Constitution, it is chilling that Rudinger now equates opposition to illegal immigration as hate speech.  But it is not surprising.  The whole movement to make hate speech illegal (as it now is in almost every Western country other than the United States) is so that the left can define any views they hate as &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and thus illegal to utter.  The left is a grave and real threat to liberty.</p>

<p>Oh, so he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the students. Gee whiz. </p>
<p>But it is the same old story. It has been the cult of PC which liberal university administrations have promoted on campuses for decades that lead to debacles like this. But these same liberals refuse to see the connection   &mdash;   that if they are going to indoctrinate students with multiculturalism, then they should not be surprised (or &#8220;disappointed&#8221;) when those same students take the actions they did against Tancredo.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, if he was all that &#8220;disappointed&#8221;; one suspects like many university administrations, the prez of UNC uses radical student groups as muscle to enforce the liberal orthodoxy.</p>
<p>As for conservatives, they need to get their act together and start fighting for their rights on campus.<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s amazing is that a former U.S. congressman, who was initially a candidate for president and involved in the earlier debates with Obama, Biden, etc., can have his speech labeled &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; by a representative of the American Civil Liberties Union in North Carolina.</p>
<p>If this woman can get away with framing the debate with this kind of label and get away with it, then this is a big part of the problem. While obviously free speech is part of the U.S. Constitution, there&rsquo;s also the famous example of not being allowed to &#8220;cry fire in a crowded theatre&#8221; if there is no fire. If Tancredo&rsquo;s right to free speech is set on the same basis as the rights of Neo-Nazis to march in a Jewish area of Skokie, Illinois, then it&rsquo;s obviously on shakier ground than if he were simply described as he really is, a conservative on the issue of illegal immigration but no more than that.</p>
<p>The &#8220;News and Observer&#8221; article should definitely have called Rudinger on that one instead of letting the remarks about &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; stand, since as it is most unaware readers will now associate the mild mannered Tancredo with some kind of violent hater in a conditioned, &#8220;knee jerk&#8221; fashion.</p>

<p>This is what I believe drove the &#8216;apology&rsquo; from Bowles (who more than likely sides with the little pretend Marxists).  </p>
<p>The chancellor claimed his phone rang steadily and &#8216;none were happy calls.&rsquo; Money talks (or in this case, makes &#8216;unhappy&rsquo; phone calls).</p>
<p>I have a feeling it was much worse than &#8216;unhappy calls.&rsquo;  Probably a number of large, wealthy donors gave the chancellor and president an earful and threatened to cut off the money flow and/or promised to use their connections to oust both.  I am not a wealthy donor but this is why I refuse to donate to the universities I attended.</p>
<p>I find Bowle&rsquo;s behavior the most dispicable  &mdash;  the little ignorant, entitlement-raised anarchists were only doing what any spoiled child would be allowed to get away with, up to and including destruction of property and threats of bodily harm.</p>
<p>Bowle&rsquo;s should have forcefully put an end to the Nazi tactics on the spot and threatened to expel ANY student who interferes with a speaker&rsquo;s First Amendment rights  &mdash;  any who were not students would be arrested for inciting a riot.  He should have demanded that the lefties respect the university&rsquo;s goal of allowing a diversity of ideas to be heard whether they agreed with those ideas or not (and yes, I know the main goal as of late in these lefty institutions of higher education is Marxist indoctrination).  Debate will be allowed but only in a civil manner.</p>
<p>Bowle&rsquo;s should have announced that there will be mandated training on the tenets of the First Amendment for ALL future incoming students (as there is mandated two hour alcohol/drug training for all incoming freshmen in the U of California system).</p>
<p>I doubt anything will be done to the pretend Marxists (who are already demanding that the university look into police brutality) lest they become martyrs for their &#8216;cause&rsquo; as they did in the &#8216;60&rsquo;s.  This will empower them to become even more threatening and violent to the next speaker with whom they disagree. </p>
<p>As for Trancredo, he needs to do what David Horowitz does before he agrees to speak on any college campus:  demand that the institution provide body guards and immediate removal of ANYONE who interferes with his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;So the only thing they can do is try to brand conservatives as racists to try to shame them into silence&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately,  silencing these days includes hurled invectives, destruction of property, threats of bodily harm and including death threats. How long will it be before they start throwing fire bombs?  They will continue as long as they are allowed to with impunity  &mdash;  and someone else is paying the bills.</p>

			<p>Saying universities like a diversity of races but not a diversity of ideas is patently false. There&rsquo;s a limit to how much racial diversity universities will put up with too. They don&rsquo;t like racial diversity at all when it comes to diversity in the form of whites. Every day and in every way they show this. At Howard, Memphis U, and Brigham Young. The next time the provost attends a diversity panel staffed by the multiple &#8216;minority&rsquo; grievance groups on campus, he should ask what the white student groups have to say, also. Even one. Any new push for diversity that doesn&rsquo;t also ask for the input of White United Students isn&rsquo;t expanding diversity on campus one bit. Far from it. Something is sorely missing from their diversity rainbow. Any honest call for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; would have to start there. Let&rsquo;s see if the debate will change if white interests are also represented. Will universities value their white students too and truly begin valuing diversity? I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;d almost have to consider white men people. Then again, that could be a bad idea the way USA looks. </p>

			<p>Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in North Carolina, said &hellip; Tancredo has the right to express his views against mass immigration, JUST AS  students &hellip; had the right to paint racist remarks against President Barack Obama &hellip;</p>
<p>Do you see what is going on?  The ACLU spokeswoman implies that racist graffiti (not sure what she is talking about  &mdash;  it is not described) is the same as an open debate on immigration. The ACLU babe gets her &#8220;dig&#8221; hinting that Tancredo is a racist. Then, if the story is reported correctly, she openly states that Tancredo was engaging in &#8220;hate&#8221; speech.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, the ACLU would love to shut down this kind of political speech, but they know they would be seen for what they are.  So they just smear those they do not agree with, all in the name of &#8220;democracy.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>Ironically a small bit of inquiry into the motivations of the mob here would no doubt reveal a large bit of violent and ultimately genocidal motivator for these kids and the profs who egg them to violence (while they safely enjoy their six figure income).  A near waste of time assuming the motivations when asking them would be so much more informative.  If anyone knows of a chat group they participate in let us all know.</p>

			<p>Free speech and &#8220;politically correct&#8221; are incompatible concepts. Both it and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; are tools used to stiffle free speech. It is my right to not like someone for whatever reason. It is my right to say so, within obvious, Supreme Court defined, limits (can&rsquo;t shout &#8220;fire&#8221; in a theater when there is none, etc.). It is my right to hold my opinions, however half-baked they may be. It is another&rsquo;s right to try and convince me of the &#8220;error&#8221; of my ways. This is called &#8220;discourse.&#8221; This used to be taught in schools. Not anymore, apparently.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. Nothing gets the message across sharp and clear  like money.  As they say, &#8220;money talks&#8221;.   If  the kids don&rsquo;t hear it, the parents surely will.  </p>
<p>And if the spoiled young  know-it-alls still don&rsquo;t get it, perhaps a job in the local supermarket stacking cans, or in McBurger&rsquo;s wrapping sandwiches, will teach them something about earning a living in the real world   &mdash;    insead ot preaching to others from an ivory tower on campus. </p>

<p>I am happy to see someone, especially one of these &#8220;Anonymous&rsquo;&#8221; agree with me on something.  However, I can&rsquo;t go so far as to condemn education.  If not for curiousity, education and research, we would all be living like beasts.  I am not for burning ANY books.  What we need to do is teach our children, homeschool if necessary in order to produce more adults who can take back higher education.  Exposing the bias in the classroom is a start.</p>
<p>I would also say that it is a prime time for the formation of a real-legitimate pro-White rights national association.  But if it symbols and language remind us of Hitler, &#8220;The Lost Cause,&#8221; or any religious sanction, it will fail.<br>

			<p>It probably never occurred to UNC-CH Chancellor Holden Thorp and UNC System President Erskine Bowles that it was THEIR students who acted that way because it was THEIR leftist faculty that, hiding behind &#8220;teacher&#8221; authority figure priviledge, demagogued those same students into the mindless, ugly, anti-free speech mob they became.</p>
<p>David Horowitz was correct, America&rsquo;s real social problem is the fully successful takeover of extreme leftist activists inside the faculties of major American universities. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Then, if the story is reported correctly, she (ACLU) openly states that Tancredo was engaging in &ldquo;hate&rdquo; speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little doubt the story will be reported on &#8216;correctly&rsquo;. Bernard Goldberg talks about the cozy relationship between reporters and progressive &#8216;activists&rsquo; in his book &#8216;Arrogance&rsquo;. Judging by the story here, the ACLU is working together with the Raleigh News and Observer - if there is not a buddy-buddy personal relationship between the two. Of course, to the reporter, the ACLU is seen as a middle of the road objective barometer of morality, while he probably never even thought of contacting a group like Students for Academic Freedom. In their mind, it&rsquo;s the other guy who&rsquo;s biased. Or perhaps the newspaper simply doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s not providing balanced coverage, as long as it&rsquo;s championing a &#8216;good cause&rsquo;. Right or wrong, that&rsquo;s the way it is. They might want to keep in mind: what comes around also goes around.  </p>

			<p>At a &#8220;sports school&#8221; like UNC, nothing will change as long as alumni attend the games and support the athletic department. If those angry callers are truly sincere, they will turn in their season basketball tickets, cancel their booster club memberships and publicly refuse to give another cent to the university in any manner. People who think a school&rsquo;s sports programs are in any way removed from the rest of the school are deluded   &mdash;   or are intentionally deluding themselves.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Events are planned at both N.C. State and UNC-Chapel Hill next week so students can discuss how to protect free speech and oppose hate speech on their campuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>That will show them&hellip; Not. All I have to say is they better hurry up and change the curriculum for that program (which will probably happen on a cold day in hell). How will these free speech/hate speech events at UNC and NCS help and not make things worse? Is there any way that could be possible? I can&rsquo;t imagine it. That&rsquo;s just the kind of place these protesters train from in the first place.</p>

<p>Every corporate public relations statement and government press release should be graded on a scale from between 1 and 10 on just how Orwellian is the deception. Of course when dealing with universities, those bastions of truth, the scale would have to start at 5 and go to 10. Why waste visual space on a graph covering areas which will never chart?</p>

<p>That site is the source of most of the articles on the murders that Amren has reprinted.</p>
<p>Of course all the posts there that scream &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;hater&#8221; at those of us who&rsquo;ve noticed the defendants aren&rsquo;t white seldom get censored.</p>
<p>Come on over and join the fun  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll be taking the day off, but there will be plenty of other playmates.</p>
<p>The fight for free speech is very real at that site, since there are articles touching on race almost every day.</p>

<p>Ranger, you&rsquo;re right!  Also, whether you agree with Schiff and Celente or not, it is never prudent to outright dismiss an opposing view.  Both men appear to me to understand things most others - including those in their field - do not.  Amerians tend to be so full of themselves, that anyone who thinks the U.S. has reached its limits are sanctioned to the looney ward.  I follow both men and support their beliefs.  They do not let ridicule or propaganda interfere with their understandings and beliefs.  The truly smart ones always hope for the best but prepare for the worst.  Lastly, if you don&rsquo;t understand something, don&rsquo;t belittle those that do.  Most of their naysayers don&rsquo;t have a clue and they just follow positive news or the informtion they happen to like better.<br>

I completely aree with you  once again. I don&rsquo;t condemn education, just the way it&rsquo;s been misused  (for indoctrination).

Yes, we should stop appeasing and apologizing!  The USA was founded and built by whites for whites.  It&rsquo;s a fact. Up until recently, there never was any  denial of that.  Until then,  the USA had always been a &#8220;racist&#8221; country, which is to say a frankly and unapologetically white country.  And to that, I say &hellip; So what?!!!    If anything, be thankful!</p>
<p>Those who gripe about it should be glad it wasn&rsquo;t built on the model of the Congo, Somalia, or Nigeria. They don&rsquo;t know how lucky they are to be here instead of there.</p>
