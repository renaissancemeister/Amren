			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Selim Algar, New York Post, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No longer able to find work, Hispanic day laborers have forged a hidden network of about 20 cleared wooded campgrounds in the shadow of million-dollar Southampton homes, The Post has learned. </p>
<p>In one area, just blocks from Saks Fifth Avenue and Intermix stores, a butchered deer carcass rots near beds made of stacked Budweiser boxes. Tattered blankets and plastic vodka bottles are piled near charred campfire remains  &mdash;  a scene repeated throughout the sprawling area. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is no work, no money,&#8221; said Manuel Hernandez, a 34-year-old native of Puebla, Mexico, as he sat in the Southampton woods on a broken boom box. &#8220;When I went across the border, I know it was wrong. But I don&rsquo;t fight, I don&rsquo;t steal. I only came here to work.&#8221; </p>
<p>His friend Carlos said that he has spent nights shivering in the woods during the harsh winter months. He said the vast majority of the nearly two dozen workers living in the woods are in the country illegally and are hesitant to enter shelters for fear of detection. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>When the area&rsquo;s booming real-estate market collapsed, demand for labor all but vanished. Workers who used to earn enough money to rent homes in the area now find themselves penniless. The camp sits on property owned by the Southampton Full Gospel Church. </p>
<p>Southampton Police Chief William Wilson said his officers check on the area periodically and that several arrests have been made. &#8220;There really isn&rsquo;t much we can do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our hands are tied on this.&#8221;<br>

			<p>If they know these camps exist and can find them and write sob stories, why can&rsquo;t ICE find them and deport them? </p>

			<p>This is good.  Reality should come to these rich and elites the hard way.  Let them have these Mexicans right in their own backyards.  They deserve it.  Then of course it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>

More proof that cheap labor comes at a high cost, if not now, then later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult not to feel some degree of schadenfreude but I don&rsquo;t believe most of the people employing illegals and others cares what&rsquo;s going outside their own homes.</p>
<p>Unless or until these unemployed look for new avenues of income (robberies, burglaries), the wealthy of Hamptons aren&rsquo;t going to do anything to cut themselves off from cheap labor. Besides, most of them believe they&rsquo;re doing gods work by employing them, even for pennies a day.<br>

<p>You could deport them. After all, just let a european get caught overstaying their visa and the government doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to put them on the next plane out. Anyway, these men would be much better off back in Mexico with their families than being homeless in New York, especially during the winter.<br>

			<p>Now if only all the illegals living in my neighborhood (typically 2 families per single family home) would just pack up and move east to Southampton and put up a tent on some rich person&rsquo;s yard.  The wealthy elite love illegal immigration because they want cheap labor; it&rsquo;s long past time they stopped imposing the costs on the rest of us.<br>

<p>No work.  No money.  No prosect of work.  No shelter.  No warmth. </p>
<p>I wonder if they are too dim-witted to understand that it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love this? Talk about people reaping what they sow. Now if only this situation could replicate itself in say Beverly Hills we would have rich, elitist, snot nose snobs such as Speilberg and company getting a dose of what they wish to impose on everybody else having it imposed on them on both coasts.</p>

<p>Actually, I can&rsquo;t blame them for staying.  If they tough it out, chances are good they&rsquo;ll be able to stay indefinitely and eventually get welfare.  Going home could jeapardize that.  Plus, they can have as many kids as they want here, and the government will pick up the tab for hospital bills and their kids will be U.S citizens.  </p>

			<p>If this weren&rsquo;t so pathetic, it would be funny. With our economy in a tailspin, we now have Hooverville tent cities popping up in parks across the country made up of foreclosed folks. Maybe these displaced people can hire these illegals living in the woods to clean their tents, sweep the leaves around, collect firewood, etc. Better yet, deport them all.</p>

			<p>You will soon notice that &#8220;tent cities&#8221; will be popping up all over the place. The issue will then be: &#8220;are these people being treated better here than they would be in Mexico&#8221;? Without work and governmental subsidies, it becomes problematical doesn&rsquo;t it? Particularly if Mexico has more work to offer than does the U. S.  But there are also other considerations too aren&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>There will come a time [and soon too] that those of us who pay taxes on absolutely everything for the support of those who pay taxes on absolutely nothing will be in a full fledged tax revolt! Tea parties are merely the start.   </p>
<p>Now lets assume the worst. If, these Mexicans have neither work nor economic support here, their only options will be either crime or returning home to Mexico. I predict that soon all laws [including immigration laws] will be placing a new meaning on the term &#8220;Draconian&#8221;! Mexicans will be looking at deportation like never before.</p>
<p>Quit swallowing the Obama Kool Aide about how well Wall Street is doing   &mdash;   or more accurately, will be doing   &mdash;   and drive through your own home towns. I&rsquo;ve done that here but hey, this is Alabama, we are used to being on the bottom of every national statistic [except perhaps college football] in existence!</p>
<p>But tell me, how is your own home town or city doing?  </p>
<p>(01) Are there more or fewer businesses closing? <br>
(02) Is unemployment going up or down? <br>
(03) How is the housing market doing? <br>
(04) Any new homes or businesses being built?<br>
(05) Are taxes going up or down? <br>
(06) Is crime going up or down?<br>
(07) Is the cost of food going up or down?<br>
(08) Is the cost of fuel going up or down? <br>
(09) Do you think that the next twelve months will be better?    <br>
(10) Or worse than the last twelve?</p>
<p>Two years ago here I could go to my favorite chicken place and get twelve pieces for sixteen dollars. Yesterday I went to the same place and got eight for twenty. And, the chicken was so skinny that it looked like it had had the flu too! Bird flu I guess!</p>

			<p>I live out in the Hamptons. This was the best article I have read in a long time. No one except a small hand full of patriots says or does anything to get rid of these invaders. The politicians, religious groups, and many of the East Ends residence are firmly behind the illegals. At the north end of Main Street in the town of Southampton every day there are  hundreds of them loitering, yet the mayor, Epley, and the police do nothing. This scenerio occurs in the other major towns as well. The police chief says that our hands are tied on this, but tied by who? Who is telling the police to ignore the loitering laws when it comes to these people and where is I.C.E.? I&rsquo;m sure if it was teenagers or white men, the police would not stand for it. The leftist, liberals on the east end of Long Island have enormous compassion for the invaders and dislike for the working class white guy. Several weeks ago some of the local politicians organized a public meeting that they called &#8220;Immigration in the Hamptons&#8221;,(of course not illegal immigrants in the Hamptons), instead of having a dialogue on the issue, every one of them basically told us to accept the illegals and learn to live with them. Congressman Tim Bishop said to the audience, &#8220;deportation is out of the question&#8221;. &#8220;Do the math&#8221;, he said several times. Who is this man getting his marching orders from that he declares deportation is out of the question? Perhaps now that the wealthy have these people living in their back yards, something will happen, but if Obama gives them amnesty it&rsquo;s game over.</p>

			<p>No community in the country deserves to be invaded by hispanic crime and squalor than the Hamptons.  The neo-cons, entertainment industry and pro immigrant liberals have taken over bringing with them as they always do cheap labor crime.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait till those cute little boys grow up.  The eastern part of Long Island will have to build a jail capable of holding tens of thousands.</p>
