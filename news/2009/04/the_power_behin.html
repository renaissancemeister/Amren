<h1>The Power behind the Power</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Chappell, Ebony, April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Individually, they hold some of the most powerful positions in Washington. But get the top African-Americans in President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration together, and the pretense and formality of their titles disappear.</p>
<p>No handshakes here. Only hugs and kisses, some good-natured ribbing and shared brother  &mdash;  and sister  &mdash;  hood.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice  &mdash;  perhaps the smallest person in the room  &mdash;    &mdash;  greets Attorney General Eric Holder  &mdash;  the tallest person in the room  &mdash;  with a bear hug. Lisa Jackson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett trade stories with U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Melody Barnes, White House Domestic Policy Council director. And Rob Nabors, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, chats with Joshua DuBois, director of the White House Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and Mike Strautmanis, the chief of staff to the assistant to the president for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Liaison. All the while, White House Social Secretary Desirée Rogers mingles with her colleagues. </p>
<p>Brought together by Ebony magazine on the White House grounds for the first time since Inauguration Day, they are part of a team put together by the president to carry forth his vision for the country. With one look at the historic collection of dynamic advisers  &mdash;  12, the most African-Americans ever in such high-powered positions within the White House  &mdash;  it is obvious that change has already come to the nation&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>Holder wants to strengthen the country&rsquo;s enforcement of civil rights laws. Jackson will tackle environmental justice problems that plague Black communities, while making sure that all Americans are included in the new &#8220;green&#8221; economy. Barnes wants domestic policy to always embrace urban America. If her previous State Department experience is any indication, Rice will bring the needs of Africa to the forefront of the world community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And in the first month, Social Secretary Rogers has brought Sweet Honey in the Rock, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and Stevie Wonder to perform at the White House, while quietly working to bring green-friendly décor to the First Residence. Not to mention that Rogers, the Sister with the Harvard education, has managed to get grits put on the White House breakfast menu.</p>

			<p>If these people are qualified, then have at it.  However&hellip;I know that when I go to any sort of store in my diverse area (Sacramento) I always avoid going through a check out line with a black checker - even with everything automated and mechanized they are materially worse.  And I think anyone who has dealt with any public bureaucracy, staffed typically by black women,or sighed with dismay when they hear a black customer service rep at the other end of the phone, has to view these black appointments with sadness for our country.</p>

			<p>Aren&rsquo;t these bruthas and sisstas suppose to serve ALL the people.  This just confirms what we already know - and we now have it in writing - that they serve each other first, no matter what the national priority is.  Well, I expect them all to be gone in less than 4 years.<br>

Nonsense. These are just a dozen conspicuous people out front with &#8220;high-powered positions&#8221;.  They are not &#8220;the power BEHIND the power&#8221;!</p>

			<p>In todays America of white guilt, political correctness, multi-cultural facism, morally superior liberal elite fanatics, and affirmative action, there is no limit to what mulattos can achieve.</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t be confused by the success of this extremely small quantity of mulattos.  They represent nothing more than statistical noise in the otherwise abject failure of most mulattos and full blown blacks in this country. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exactly as I predicted months ago.  And I&rsquo;ll lay ten to one odds that not a single black appointment is really qualified intellectually for the position he/she holds.  These positions are ones where the rank and file under them can do the work while the blacks act as nothing more than privileged figureheads.</p>
<p>Look, folks.  This Obamanation has spent his entire adult life working for blacks any way he can with white, self-hating  radicals who despise whites in general.  His preacher and white hating potential rioters in his church tells every AWARE white where Obama is coming from.  Why would he magically change course just because he was elected president?</p>
<p>After all those years manipulating the system to favor blacks, and after all the despicable white hatred his friends and his wife constantly uttered, only a blind fool wouldn&rsquo;t expect this man to do exactly what he is doing right now.</p>
<p>It will get far worse.  And, as I said many times, we won&rsquo;t have to do anything, but be prepared to defend ourselves, because with this bunch in office the situation will deteriorate rapidly all on its own.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself buddy. There will be MORE of them not less in 4 years time. If you think they are here only temporarily you are sadly mistaken. The worst thing of all is that this situation is Non reversable. By voting in Obama, America has opened up a pandoras box and there is no closing the lid now.</p>

			<p>  Almost every one of President Obama&rsquo;s appointees is like Obama of mixed race. Some are light enough to be considered Quadroons. It reminds me of Haiti where the mulatto elite rules over the black majority. Of course, here, for now, whites are still in the majority. </p>

Blacks desperately believe that the reason they fall behind in so many areas is because of a white supremacist power structure that actively works to oppress them. Those of us who read AR know that black failure comes from within, not outside.</p>
<p>Now that blacks have &#8216;the power&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re going to try to dismantle this alleged white power structure. But there is no white power structure to dismantle so their work and efforts can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t change anything other than to cause more damage to whites trying to live their daily lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want. All we can do until the trouble passes is let them run their great and noble experiments which are based on absurd theories and lies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long held that we&rsquo;re going to have to suffer through a long period of failed policies based on failed theory until all the theories have run their course and what we&rsquo;re left with is the racial truth.</p>
<p>Ranger echos my views. They&rsquo;re going to forces these policies and theories on us. We need to take a defensive positions to protect our own. </p>

			<p>As AWM notes, most of these are mulattoes, very light skinned. As white as Obama, who is not black, except for political purposes.</p>
<p>Without meaning any negative implication, the important jobs are held by first, Jews, and second white of Christian background, though I doubt they practice christianity(Geitner). Obama&rsquo;s main financial supporters are Jewish-from Chicago and NY(the same crowd now receiving handouts).</p>
<p>the problem is not that Jews or any other group run the govt. The problem is that the President pulled a scam and succeeded. The media believes he is black. Obama gets much mileage from this lie. He is cut enormous slack. He is very devious.</p>
<p>Ghetto and HS level grad blacks will in the end receive nothing from Obama. The educational gaps will be as great if not greater. The inflation from his spending will hit low income people the worst, thus blacks will be disproportionately affected.</p>
<p>The &#8220;greens&#8221; will be the happiest bamamaniacs as he will shower jobs in industry, academia and govt upon them, even as carbon remains our primary fuel, because it has to. Most indeed nearly all greens are white and middle or upper middle class.</p>
<p>Obama should be an object of ridicule by blacks. Instead they worship him. </p>
<p>They really are dumb.</p>

			<p>Great.  The White House has now turned into the national headquarters for the DMV.  If you&rsquo;re in an even remotely metropolitan area, you know how these Jermyns run the show.  God help yt.</p>

			<p>I use the &#8220;3:00 A.M. test to evaluate this. All these people are there to add &#8220;color&#8221; to the staff. In a 3:00 A.M. type emergency all the personnel is non of color. If an allied country is attacked, or the Pound or Euro collapses, then a white guy will be the President&rsquo;s advisor. If a Spotted Owl gets the sniffles, or something like that, then one of the affirmative action/diversity appointments can come out to bloviate on the subject.</p>

			<p>Y&rsquo;all expected something else? They&rsquo;s gots it now! And they&rsquo;s gonna make whitey pay&hellip;</p>
<p>And ditto on the female black rep thing. Anything a little complex and they are lost. Then, please God, don&rsquo;t ask them to do anything! The results are unpredictable. My mother did a change of address with a black rep for her health insurance and wound up uninsured for a year. Just hang up and try again.</p>

<p>Well, I happen to believe the economy will get so bad, that even a few Obamamaniacs will turn.  Let&rsquo;s not forget, many whites who voted for Obama did so out of fear of the downward economy.  The vast majority of whites do not support him.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before the goons at the top run out of tricks.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement with GetBackJack.  Obama will be the &#8220;first &amp; last&#8221; black president.  Most of the whites who voted for him did so in order to prove to themselves they are not racists, and because they thought it would be good for race relations.  So now they&rsquo;ve checked &#8220;Vote for black president&#8221; off their checklist.  In 2012, things will be so bad, conservatives will look pretty dang good.  I expect Dems to lose control of Congress in 2010 and another Ronald Reagan type   &mdash;   maybe 3rd party   &mdash;   to arise by 2012. </p>
