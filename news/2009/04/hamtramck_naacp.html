<h1>Hamtramck NAACP Picks Asian to Lead</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cecil Angel, Detroit Free Press, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Bangladeshi American has become the first Asian American to head an NAACP chapter in Michigan, breathing new life into the Hamtramck chapter that had officially been inactive until earlier this year.</p>
<p>Asm Rahman said he joined the NAACP in 2003 after hearing reports about racial profiling and other forms of discrimination experienced by some Hamtramck residents of Bangladeshi and Middle Eastern descent following the 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six years later, he was elected president of the Hamtramck NAACP chapter.</p>
<p>Yvonne White, president of the Michigan State Conference NAACP, said immigrants from Bangladesh and the Middle East account for almost half the 68 members of the Hamtramck chapter, which became active again in February. The chapter, which is at least 30 years old, was inactive for about two years.</p>
<p>Chris Fleming, spokesman for the national NAACP, said that the NAACP does not track the ethnicity of its members and can&rsquo;t say how many non-African Americans are members of the group, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There have been other non-African Americans who have served in leadership posts at NAACP chapters, including Peter Leung, a Chinese American who served as the president of the Corvalis, Ore., branch, and Nilakantan Nagarajan, an Indian immigrant who served as state treasurer for the NAACP Delaware State Conference of Branches.</p>
<p>Census figures show that 18.3% of Hamtramck&rsquo;s 20,485 residents have Asian roots.</p>
<p>Ahmed Alammari, 41, a Yemeni American who works in Hamtramck for the Arab American Chaldean Council, joined the local NAACP two months ago.</p>

<p>Under black leadership, the NAACP has been on life support for years.</p>
<p>Notice how when things get really bad for blacks, blacks have to find people outside of their community to solve their problems.<br>

			<p>It is true that non-blacks have led the NAACP.  AIRC, most of the founders of the NAACP were white.</p>

<p>And what does that say about &ldquo;immigrants from Bangladesh and the Middle East?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are they really here to &ldquo;work hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;embrace the American Dream&rdquo; as is mainstream, or do they grasp for a different &ldquo;dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they are joining the NAACP in such numbers, I think the answer should be pretty obvious!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>As always, you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head. People of other colors (brown and yellow) will revive this failing organization in a way that blacks never could. Whites will pay the price and blacks will sit back and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>They will always be a people who destroy everything they touch, and then complain when someone else doesn&rsquo;t fix what they have broken.<br>

			<p>This does not surprise anybody here. We all know that as the demographics of America evolve so will the ethnicity of it&rsquo;s leaders. Thats something we can&rsquo;t contol so I don&rsquo;t waste my time thinking about it.</p>

			<p>What this means is that asian &#8220;americans&#8221; are playing the racial grievance game agianst Native Born White Americans. And they are now doing it through civil rights structures set up by blacks.</p>
<p>If and when Native Born White Amreicans become a racial minority within the borders of America, they will face vicious discrimination at the hands of post-1965 asians. I want to point out  that  Taki.com-which is basically a shrine to LEGAL asian immigration enthusiast Ron Paul-allows asian supremacist Razib Kahn to make posts on a regular basis. </p>

			<p>The word &#8220;Asian&#8221; is not useful, in this context.  Let&rsquo;s be more specific. The man is a Middle Eastern Muslim.  You can read more here:</p>

			<p>Hindu, Buddhist, Muslims, Jews, Christians and other religious representations are present in Hamtramck and we do live peacefully here.  However, during this economic time, Hamtramck is not immune to common crime.  There is absolutely no racial issues in Hamtramck.<br>
Debbie Schlussel&rsquo;s blog is full of hatred and misinformation.  Do not believe her story.  She is a right winger and has an ulterior motive in inciting hatred amongst the minorities. This is the only option left for the right wing extremists to get some attention.  Tell her Bushism is defeated.</p>
