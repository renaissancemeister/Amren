<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/17/mexicans-32-percent-of-all-immigrants-in-us/">Mexicans Total 32% of Immigrants</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama arrived in Mexico for a visit Thursday but he could have stayed home if he was looking for a Mexican audience. </p>
<p>A record 12.7 million Mexican immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2008, a 17-fold increase since 1970, according to a study released Thursday by the Pew Hispanic Center. </p>
<p>&#8220;About 11 percent of everyone born in Mexico is currently living in the U.S.,&#8221; the study said. </p>
<p>Mexicans now account for 32 percent of all immigrants living in this country {snip}.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other country in the world has as many total immigrants from all countries as the United States has immigrants from Mexico alone. Other than the United States, the country that hosts the largest number of immigrants is Russia, with 12 million foreign born,&#8221; the study said. </p>
<p>The majority of Mexican citizens in the U.S.  &mdash;  55 percent  &mdash;  are here illegally. And Mexicans comprise a majority (59 percent) of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants now within our borders. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also growing is the number of &#8220;anchor babies,&#8221; the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants whose place of birth automatically entitles them to American citizenship, an &#8220;anchor&#8221; for the rest of the family to stay in the United States. </p>
<p>Illegal immigrants &#8220;are more likely than either U.S.-born residents or legal immigrants to live in a household with a spouse and children. In addition, a growing share of the children of unauthorized immigrant parents  &mdash;  73 percent  &mdash;  were born in this country and are U.S. citizens,&#8221; the study said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>What galls me is that Mexico is considered a U.S. &#8220;ally&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>They had probably secretly laughing at the way we continue to take millions and millions of them without doing a thing to stop it. </p>

			<p>When the Mexican Presidential elections were held in 2000, one of the major candidates (was it Vincente Fox?) began his campaign in Los Angeles, because (1) There were/are so many Mexican nationals there, and (2) 2000 was the first Mexican Presidential election where Mexicans in another country illegally and Mexicans with another country&rsquo;s citizenship could vote in Mexican elections.  Fox was right when he said that where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.  Los Angeles is Mexico.</p>

			<p>Instead of groveling to the Mexican President, Obama should present him with a bill for public services Mexican illegals receive in the US, including public schools. Until the bill is paid, close the border, stop tourism, treat  Mexico like Cuba. Indeed I&rsquo;d rather open up our trade and tourism to Cuba before Mexico. At this point, Mexico is a bigger and more dangerous threat than the fumbling Castro Brothers carnival.</p>

			<p>What a shameful statistic for a country to have.  Mexico is the wealthiest country in Latin America, yet, because of the widespread endemic corruption of drug money and the wholesale theft of the nation&rsquo;s treasury by corrupt government officials, there are no jobs for the country&rsquo;s people nor is the infrastructure above a very basic third world level.</p>
<p>Too, the people themselves are not of sufficient competence to produce those who would step forward and upgrade the culture and conditions.</p>
<p>Many parts of the country are nothing but tar paper shacks with tin roofs.   Raw sewage runs openly down the streets creating a rotten odor that permeates the air in many places, making it difficult for visitors to breathe.</p>
<p>Drivers licenses, permits, vendor certificates and every other necessary government document can be purchased with bribes to local officials.    The corruption, however, isn&rsquo;t just local.  It prevails throughout the federal government itself.  </p>
<p>Legal justice is for sale to whomever can pay for it, including murder charges, rape crimes, and most certainly officials from local levels all the way up to people close to Calderon himself have been caught with drug pesos in their pockets.</p>
<p>Every Mexican in the US today is living proof of the failure and shame of Mexico.  It&rsquo;s a failed country that is far beyond corruption. If the drug gangs finally take control of the government, I seriously doubt that the change will be noticeable to the average citizen.</p>
<p>Why any Mexican in this country would proudly display the Mexican flag anywhere is a mystery that defies all reasoning.</p>
<p>If I were Mexican, I would be ashamed to admit I was from that country.<br>

			<p>Somebody could compile a list of criminal offenses and negative factors that non-white immigrants bring to every country in the West, and it would reveal absolutely shocking figures.</p>
<p>The latest in the criminal immigrant problem comes from data out of Norway that reveals that 100% of all rapes recently were by non-whites, Africans and Kurds.</p>

			<p>A 17-fold increase since 1970? I thought it would be more than that. From what I&rsquo;ve always heard, up until about the early eighties the U.S. was almost a staunchly White country (except for the South) with about 90% of people being White. In the 2000 Mexican election, Mexicans in the U.S. could vote for president of Mexico. The Southwest is a lost cause. If you are young, White and don&rsquo;t speak Spanish you&rsquo;re SOL. Where I live the majority of jobs in newspaper say billingual required.</p>
<p>The only thing bad about being White these days is that there is nowhere for our own people.</p>

			<p>Am I correct, in saying there are now more Mexican immigrants than all White immigrants? Maybe even White and Black? </p>
<p>If so, a sub-10% ethnic/racial population group having more immigrants than one of about 80% doesn&rsquo;t seem right!</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t seem very democratic! <br>

			<p>All the women attacked need to sue the government for letting these immigrants in. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Unlike Americans, Norwegians previously have had no exposure to people of different races, as such they are very naive and sheltered. Now they are finding out the hard way about blacks and others.</p>

			<p>In the same spirit of &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; that Presidents Bush and Obama have weighed in to urge Europe to allow Turkey, and millions of Islamic Turkish peasants, to move into our beautiful lands I suggest that we Europeans urge America to open it&rsquo;s borders to Mexico.</p>
<p>If that suggestion upsets anyone then you will know how mad we are with your successive Presidents.</p>
<p>You, like us, have people in charge who are determined to destroy our respective societies.</p>

			<p>Geoff M., you are speaking to the wrong crowd; we opppose Turkey&rsquo;s admission into the EU!</p>
<p>The ones you might want to address, are the Neocons and fringe &#8220;anti-racists.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When our economy totally collapses within a couple of years [which it will] most of the Mexicans will be going back to Mexico   &mdash;   providing, of course, that the middle class is not continuing to be taxed to death to provide for their on going support.</p>
<p>There is enough blame to go around here between the Republicans and Democrats. Both want the Hispanic vote at the white, working, middle classes&rsquo; expense. Fine, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way anymore! The check is coming to the table with Barney and his boyfriends busy looking the other way! Our Chinese waiter is growing impatient!      </p>
<p>With the retail tax base continuing to contract i.e. Circuit City, Home Depot, Starbucks, K Mart, Big K, Sears, Linen and Things, Macys, S and K Clothing, Blockbuster, the auto industry, the banking industry, the financial industry, the real estate industry, etc. etc. just who do you think is going to be paying for all of these bloated, politically correct, totally incompetent, totally corrupt, black city governments which have now lost their tax base? </p>
<p>WHO? </p>
<p>Ahh I see! So you think that YOU TOO are going to be getting a bailout do you? The government just needs to print more money does it? What do you think will happen when the people [like the Chinese are doing now] realize that &#8220;full faith and credit&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean much when the country printing this so called money can&rsquo;t  possibly pay its way out of debt? Fiat money? My God! Anyone ever heard of Zimbabwe?   </p>
<p>So President Obama had to pay off his rich Wall Street Backers and then he had to funnel enough money to his blacks to keep them from rioting did he? Fine,  he&rsquo;s brilliant. He&rsquo;s a Harvard man [of sorts] isn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;s smarter than all of us isn&rsquo;t he?  </p>
<p>So now the check is now coming due and guess who will be picking it up? The simple fact is that our country is now in the process of unraveling with the Mexicans already owning our South West and the Cubans owning Miami. And you think that crime is bad now do you?  </p>
<p>Another word for Balkanization is succession! A red neck, Alabama country boy, who I have known for a long time, is considering a move to New Hampshire. Trust me, it takes a lot for a boy who is used to 105 degree temperatures [with 100 per cent humidity] in the summers and 50 degree temperatures in the winter to consider a move like this. A lot! </p>
<p>The Mexican problem is just a symptom of a terminally ill patient! </p>

<p>MoMo, that&rsquo;s just wishful thinking and I don&rsquo;t even think you believe it. Why else are you moving from Alabama to New Hampshire? </p>
<p>Whites are a northern race. Part of me thinks what we really need to do is establish a homeland in the parts of this country that suit our nature and join up with Canada. We are people who like grey drizzly weather sometimes with green trees and seasons and wide open spaces. </p>
<p>There is a reason the Hispanics are taking places like Florida and southern California. Those places are not made for our kind. Maybe a realistic way separation with happen is letting go of places that don&rsquo;t suit us and unifying the places that do. It doesn&rsquo;t have to happen violently like in Chittum&rsquo;s Civil War III book, but the basic lay of the land is not far off.</p>
<p>If there is anything to global warming, then Canada and Alaska might open up and become really nice living spaces for our kind. Same for the far north of Europe and even Russia. </p>
<p>Part of believing in a way of life rooted in nature means adapting to Mother Nature&rsquo;s changes. Sometimes what seems like a loss is really an opportunity for growth and expansion. </p>
