<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6094170.ece">Young, Gifted and Black: China Unveils Ding Hui, Its New Olympic Hope</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leo Lewis, Times (London), April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sports magazines have breathlessly hailed his &#8220;special characteristics&#8221;; learned analysts have spoken in awed tones about the &#8220;athleticism of his genes&#8221; and some have praised the &#8220;whiteness and size&#8221; of his teeth. </p>
<p>At its core, though, the source of all the excitement is simple: Ding Hui, the latest addition to China&rsquo;s fiercely competitive national volleyball squad, is black. </p>
<p>His father is South African and his mother Chinese and he was brought up in the east coast industrial city of Hangzhou. The 19-year-old may be mixed-race but is still, according to participants in an online sports chat room yesterday, &#8220;exactly as black&#8221; as President Obama. </p>
<p>The prodigiously talented defender is expected to be at the heart of China&rsquo;s quest for gold at the London Olympics in 2012. He is already a central figure in the provincial team of Zhejiang and represented China in the youth squad five years ago. </p>
<p>However, Ding&rsquo;s prominence presents a challenge to many in a country where the word &#8220;foreigner&#8221; tends to conjure the image of a Caucasian and where &#8220;black&#8221; can be greeted with suspicion. </p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese views towards black people are not sophisticated, partly because it is not very common to see any in the cities and even less in the country,&#8221; a group of Beijing residents told The Times. &#8220;A lot of people will be very curious about Ding, and will be positive towards this decision to have him on the team. On the other hand, there are still plenty of Chinese who, unfortunately, think of black people as somewhat barbarous or automatically assume they are involved in crime.&#8221; The Government insists that racism does not exist in China but some commentators remain sceptical. Beijing&rsquo;s energetic investments in Africa  &mdash;  many centred on the supply of oil from Angola and other big regional producers  &mdash;  is the culmination of many decades of strong Sino-African relations. China was never involved in the black slave trade, which has eased its dealings on the continent and allowed it to talk, during the Cold War, of a &#8220;Third World coalition&#8221;. </p>
<p>However, the treatment of black students has not been without controversy and African and Chinese students clashed violently in the 1980s. There are suggestions, too, that black people living in Beijing were the target of a pre-Olympic police crackdown last summer. </p>
<p>Attempts to herald the arrival of Ding in the national squad have revealed a definite gaucheness. One of China&rsquo;s biggest internet portals described him thus: &#8220;Black skin, thick lips and big white teeth are his main characteristics,&#8221; it read, adding that &#8220;due to the special characteristics of his bloodline Ding Hui is blessed with pliability, toughness and agility&#8221;. <br>

			<p>And he looks more black than Obama.  In fact, he&rsquo;s almost as black as the average American black.  The reason is that Oriental genetics are submissive to whites, and whites are submissive to blacks.  So he&rsquo;s a a mix of the most dominant and the most submissive type of genetics, so of course he&rsquo;s going to look far more black than Oriental.</p>

<p>The PC lie in translation: racism is the result of ignorance.</p>
<p>If the Chinese come in contact with full blooded Africans, their lack of &#8216;sophistication&rsquo; will turn into a cold slap in the face of reality.</p>
<p>The more interaction you have with blacks, they more you see them as different. Experience, not ignorance, is what leads to racial awareness.</p>
<p>The Chinese are being set up for a hard lesson in reality, just like we were. </p>

<p>Actually, judging by the 1st generation white-asian hybrids i have seen, white genetics appears to be submissive to asian genetics. These hybrids look mostly asian but in an odd way. They also tend to be larger. </p>

<p>Definitely true. But I suspect the implication is also: racism is the result of the legacy whites have left on the world. In this light, maybe the Chinese and Blacks really can get along.</p>

<p>Wow!  How lucky can they get?  A superstar for their vollyball team.</p>
<p>Now if only they could produce someone bright enough to advance their weapons program so they don&rsquo;t have to continue stealing our inventions.</p>
<p>Too, when they run out of water and food, maybe he can jump up and hit the ball back over the net, which will be as good as drinking and eating.</p>

<p><br>
Within living memory that statement of black ABSENCE was also true of Great Britain, France and Canada. How ironic that this article was written by a Briton too! What the writer patronizingly derides as &#8220;unsophistication&#8221; is really just a natural and well-founded wariness of blacks. The Chinese will certainly develop very strong opinions of blacks as they interact more and more with them. But they will be negative opinions, not positive ones, &#8220;sophistication&#8221; notwithstanding.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t believe for a second that the Chinese have embraced multiculturalism. As long as they have to, they will try to win favor among dictators in resource rich Africa, and if they have to parade around little Sino-African halfings then they will. The Chinese are some of the most nationalistic people in the world (just like the Japanese) they don&rsquo;t even view full blooded Chinese born in North America as Chinese. Interracial children are viewed as abominations. <br>
I always thought it was so ironic that in legitimately Marxist regimes the people are nationalistic. The same can be said for former Marxist regimes like in eastern Europe. Its only in the &#8220;free west&#8221; where Marxism is ACTUALLY taken seriously.</p>

The article says that he is &#8220;prodigiously talented.&#8221; Upon reading this, I realized that I have never heard of an individual member of a volley ball team picked out for praise this way. Volley ball is very much a team sport.</p>
<p>So there seems to be an element of &#8220;let&rsquo;s all worship the black guy to show we aren&rsquo;t prejudiced.&#8221; It starts to get tiresome.</p>

From the article: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese views towards black people are not sophisticated.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be far more accurate to say this instead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese view black people as not sophisticated&#8221;</p>
<p>And on this the Chinese are right. </p>

			<p>Wow.  Didn&rsquo;t see that coming.  Much of it has me rolling with laughter: &#8220;My, what large, white teeth he has! &#8221;  </p>
<p>What a coincidence that in China, &#8220;black can be greeted with suspicion&#8221;.   Same here! Especially among those who&rsquo;ve been unlucky enough to have a lot of experience with them.</p>
<p>That last line is really something.  I&rsquo;d have thought they would be proud of their own, rather than awed by africans.  I mean,  Jet Li &amp; Jackie Chan sure don&rsquo;t seem to lack for &#8220;pliability, toughness and agility&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for the whole question of black athletic superiority, it seems many have neglected to actually ask it!  That is, is it true?

			<p>&#8220;The Government insists that racism does not exist in China but some commentators remain sceptical.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do they define Racism?</p>
<p>This is how the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan operates.  Straight-faced lying, or misrepresentation.  They claim to be the final word and so, feel its only right that they define ALL words.  Especially the important ones, ones that will effect our lives.  That this is nothing more than Marxism in its crudest form is clear.  They did the same thing with the word &#8220;Class&#8221;, and employed the same Caveman logic, &#8220;Them Bad, Us Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they define the word Racism or Racist and it pretty much boils down to - Racist is anyone who doesn&rsquo;t love Non-Whites unconditionally.<br>
Never mind that anyone who expects to be loved unconditionally by anyone except maybe their parents, shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised that they end up being hated intensely; we are not dealing with reasonable behavior here.  We are dealing with people who are constitutionally uncapable of grasping a manner of living that requires honesty.  They just can&rsquo;t do it.  And that is why I have said in other posts here, and not just here, that we are living in an Inverted World, a Gangster Culture.</p>
<p>The world has been turned upside down and it is Criminal Behavior that is not only promoted, encouraged, and rewarded; it is actually Placed Above Criticism!!!!<br>
This is a position formerly occupied by the word &#8220;God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, we live in an Age where the Devil has become God.</p>

			<p>Call me old fashioned, but, having good genes for volleying a ball over a net should not be applauded . <br>
This also applies to breeding for having genes that make you freakishly tall, violent, and having the ability to &#8220;slam dunk&#8221; a ball through a whoop .</p>
<p>I think I would prefer to see a desire for breeding the type of intellignet person who might cure cancer or develop alternative energy sources or technology advances, etc .<br>

			<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me to see this guy defect to the West - specifically the USA - at the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>He sucks up the adulation now, because his way is being paid by the state. But, just like Cuban baseball players and boxers, that counts for nothing. If they saw a chance to defect Castro&rsquo;s paradise, they took it. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just biding his time until the team travels to a Western venue, specifically London in 2012.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s the other way around. There are still plenty of black people who are barbarous or are involved in crime, and  other people have good reason to be nervous.  That is  what&rsquo;s unfortunate.  Don&rsquo;t blame the Chinese for their normal, healthy survival instincts. What&rsquo;s a shame is that we have lost ours.</p>
<p><i>China was never involved in the black slave trade, which has eased its dealings on the continent and allowed it to talk, during the Cold War, of a &ldquo;Third World coalition&rdquo;. </i></p>
<p>Funny, that hasn&rsquo;t impeded the Arabs or Persians from participating in a Third World coalition.   What&rsquo;s odder still is that it was whites who ENDED the slave trade, for what little  credit they get, while those same Arabs and Persians (and Africans too!) had been engaging in it for many centuries.   And they would be still if Europeans hadn&rsquo;t stopped them.</p>
<p>That  just goes to show you once again how little African Blacks know of history&hellip; even their own.</p>

			<p>My wife is Chinese.  She, and every other Chinese I ever met and talked with, have no illusions about blacks.  Indeed, generally, Chinese are essentially anti-black in their outlook.  A Chinese woman marrying a Western white man is not particularly frowned upon by families (except for Chinese men  &mdash;  but this is to be expected), and often encouraged.  At the same time, a Chinese woman marrying a black can expect problems from family, friends, and just about everyone else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with Chinese inflitration into, and exploitation of, Africa certain blacks have emigrated (at least temporarily) to China.  This is a big mistake for the Chinese to let happen, in my opinion.  The blacks are isolated in ghettos, they are often Muslim, and the situation is a time bomb ticking. The good news is the Chinese do mind enforcing discipline  &mdash;  something blacks need.  So, I doubt that any Chinese cities will wind up like, say, Detroit.  The Chinese will not tolerate black hooliganism, I don&rsquo;t believe.</p>

			<p>Sun Yat-sen was one of modern China&rsquo;s founding fathers. The Western influence in his life inspired him to make the &#8216;Three Principles of the People&rsquo; - a system of checks and balances that was expanded to include Chinese Administrative tradition. In conjunction with his belief in pan-Asianism, he literally wanted to create an Asian America. This was back in 1912. Much like the British formed the base of the USA, I think Sun wanted the Chinese to be the stock of a pan-Asian dream. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it never quite came to pass. Despite that, I see many characteristics of Old America reflected in modern China. Contrary to what many think, the Chinese are not intolerant. Yes there are nationalists, but there are more who are just concerned with trying to make a better life.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that a Chinese-black player is now on a major team for China. It also doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that a group of Chinese went around beating black foreign exchange students. This is no different than what America went through. The only difference in this case is that the Chinese are slightly more racially aware. It is this awareness that protects them, but it is also something that may be preventing them from being greater than they are&hellip; China, and indeed all of Asia, would benefit from more intra-East Asian mixing.</p>
<p>Napoleon proclaimed, &#8220;Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world&#8221;.  What did he mean? What did he see that many did not, and still do not? I think I know. He saw a 2nd USA.</p>

			<p>The reason Chinese views on blacks is &#8220;unsophisticated&#8221; is that they&rsquo;ve had little direct contact with large numbers of them.  For &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; views, ask the remaining whites of South Africa, Detroit or Haiti.  They know that, as a group, blacks are, indeed, far more crime-prone than Asians.  They also know that black males lust after non-black women far more than they lust after their own women.  Hence it is no accident that such mixed race people almost always have a black father - but rarely a black mother.</p>

			<p>So the guy can play volleyball. Big deal. How does that make him &#8220;gifted&#8221;? Is he a mental giant? Does he offer anything in the advancement of science? Is he working on a cure for cancer? Like all blacks its just about athletics or entertainment. I sincerely hope the Chinese don&rsquo;t follow the disgraceful White American trend of extolling black athlete-thugs as &#8220;heroes&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The reason is that Oriental genetics are submissive to whites, and whites are submissive to blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I am seeing where I live and there are quite a few of these people in my location.  What I have noticed about almost all of them is they have the asian eye and dark hair. I think the asian eye dominates when mixed with another race.  IMO those asian eyes do not look attractive when set upon caucasian facial structure or african facial structures.</p>
