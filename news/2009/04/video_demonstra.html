<h1>Video: Demonstrators Speak in the Pit</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While former U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode gave a speech in the Student Union, several students and activists gathered in the Pit to discuss diversity and freedom of speech. Several members of Students for a Democratic Society attended the protest.</p>

								<h2>Less Fireworks at UNC Speech This Time</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Martha Quillin, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), April 23, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The crowd that came to Virgil Goode Jr.&rsquo;s speech Wednesday night at UNC-Chapel Hill heckled and harassed the former Virginia congressman, but did not stop him from speaking.</p>
<p>A handful of people who sought to disrupt his speech were arrested.</p>
<p>Goode spoke to a crowd of about 150 in the student union auditorium, detailing the history of U.S. Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action, which he opposes, and illegal immigration, which he also strongly opposes.</p>
<p>He was brought to campus by the UNC chapter of Youth for Western Civilization, which opposes multiculturalism and mass immigration. They are the same group who sponsored Tom Tancredo, their national chairman, on campus last week.</p>
<p>At least a dozen campus police were on hand Wednesday&rsquo;s event to prevent a repeat of Tancredo&rsquo;s appearance at which protesters shouted and unfurled signs, ultimately stopping his speech.</p>
<p>The crowd had to be dispersed by pepper-spray wielding police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At one point, Winston Crisp, the UNC assistant vice chancellor for student affairs, warned hecklers in the audience that disruptive behavior would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>A news release from UNC-CH stated that several audience members set off personal body alarms that had to be located and turned off by police. There was no violence or vandalism, but six people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UNC-CH Chancellor Holden Thorp issued a statement after the event, saying he regretted the arrests, but that the audience had been warned.</p>

			<p>It will only be when white men are denied &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too, that the whole hate whitey train will seriously begin to slow down in earnest. Being race-realists, we do have to face the fact that the whole hate-theWest outlook is destined to forever be the predominant ideology in the US, but we can make strides on presenting an alternative view. I really don&rsquo;t see discrimination against white men being the solution to the problem of most black children growing up poor being viable for another 30 years, affirmative action programs, that is.  </p>

			<p>Well, I must state with unshakable resolve, that the highly thoughtful and masterfully talented &ldquo;Crunchy Cat&rdquo; has changed my views on this topic for all time to come!</p>
<p>I shall be henceforth totally committed to both Marxism and the cause of the &ldquo;undocumented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I want to be &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; and also of course a piece of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you know&hellip;just watch the video. </p>

			<p>   Hey John PM,, I was eating a sandwich when the Crunchy Cat segment came on. I almost choked to death from laughing so hard. If that was my kid, I would cut off her/his/its tuition. And to think that it was on you tube. People worldwide are laughing at this windbag.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a way to at least stop the white male protesters.  Send them to prison.  A typical majority black and Hispanic prison.  That&rsquo;s an extreme measure, but it will make a white man into a race realist if nothing else does.</p>

<p>   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s not going to take 30 years to make Whites a minority.  It&rsquo;s going to be more like 10-15 years.  That 2042 Bull_ _ _ _ is not what&rsquo;s happening.  We&rsquo;re 61% of the population right now including the illegals and at the present rate it&rsquo;s only going to take between a decade and a decade and a half to make us a minority.  That 2042 nonsense is meant to lull us into a false sense of security so we&rsquo;ll continue to be lackadaisical in letting multiculturalism continue to take over our country.<br>

			<p>At least the protesters don&rsquo;t really look scary. They look nothing like the masked crowd that forced Jared Taylor from his lectern, and indeed the room. Or the crowd that tried to beat conservative audience members leaving a Nick Griffin? speech in Michigan. Or the crowd from the day before that shouted down Tancredo and broke the windows, although I admit I&rsquo;ve never seen that last video. </p>
<p>I remember the Kent State shooting (where the national guard, probably fresh from Vietnam, fired on student protesters). I remember asking my older brother, who was enrolled at a another college at the time, about it. He said some of the students killed were just walking to class, others had been nearby just watching the protest. I even watched a good bit of the movie about it years later. Whatever that was about, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have brought it up but Oh well. </p>

			<p>   An interesting point on Kent State, either Discovery or A&E; has aired a documentary about it several times and those kid&rsquo;s parents were furious over their lawless tactics and were not real sympathetic to what befell them . In short, they blamed the kids more than the Guard . The ROTC building that had been extinguished once was set afire again and either burned to the ground or was heavily damaged, plus there was private property that was damaged uptown . I wish the whole affair could&rsquo;ve been avoided but it seems if there was any one party who could&rsquo;ve prevented it, it would have to have been the kids . </p>

			<p>The Crunchy Cat bit, while amusing, really wasn&rsquo;t all that shocking. The dope behind her (it&rsquo;s a her, right?) however, the one in the red cowboy hat bobbing her head up and down like she was really into Cat&rsquo;s rap, was just weird. </p>

			<p>They should try taking their &#8220;No Human is Illegal&#8221; sign to Mexico and see how much good that&rsquo;ll do them should they choose to settle there.  Oh, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to see that they actual got a real &#8220;person of color&#8221; (sort of) to speak at their little &#8220;protest&#8221;.  I think she said something about &#8220;challenging your mind&#8221; or being &#8220;open-minded&#8221;.  If so, she should understand that attitudes like that are what brings people to Amren.  People come to Amren because they&rsquo;ve challenged the mainstream ideology and they&rsquo;ve chosen to explore other perspectives.  Their schools, their televisions and their daily newspapers don&rsquo;t send them to Amren; only their open minds send them here.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No Human is illegal&#8221;  Right.  I mean, a human that breaks into my house isn&rsquo;t illegal, right?  A human that rapes, murders, and steals isn&rsquo;t illegal, right?  A human that breaks into my country, refuses to learn my languages, bankrupts most of public services and in turn calls me a racist, surely isn&rsquo;t illegal, right?  Right.</p>

			<p>To Roller, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey John PM,, I was eating a sandwich when the Crunchy Cat segment came on. I almost choked to death from laughing so hard. If that was my kid, I would cut off her/his/its tuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed Roller, that was quite a &ldquo;happening&rdquo; by the effervescent Crunchy Cat; it also begs for a Top Ten Questions list.</p>
<p>1.) Just what is Crunchy Cat?</p>
<p>2.) Does Crunchy Cat have parents, or was it made in an SPLC laboratory by the evil Comrade Dees?</p>
<p>3.) Just what could Crunchy Cat possibly be &ldquo;studying&rdquo; at UNC-Chapel Hill?</p>
<p>4.) Does Crunchy Cat use a litter box and who cleans it?</p>
<p>5.) If your son or daughter came home with Crunchy Cat, what would you do?</p>
<p>6.) Are those others behind Crunchy Cat its fans, or its backup singers?</p>
<p>7.) What might Crunchy Cat&rsquo;s IQ be?</p>
<p>8.) Does Crunchy Cat&rsquo;s inflated opinion of itself exceed that IQ on a comparative graph?</p>
<p>9.) Does Crunchy Cat favor Meow Mix or Cat Chow?</p>
<p>10.) Just what will Crunchy Cat be doing 20 years from now, if the freak show industry has a massive downturn and never recovers?</p>
<p>Have a great week Roller,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>
