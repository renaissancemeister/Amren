			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Isenstadt, Politico, April 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Key members of the Congressional Black Caucus are calling for an end to U.S. prohibition on travel to Cuba, just hours after a meeting with former Cuban president Fidel Castro in Havana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lee [CBC Chairwoman Barbara Lee (D-Ca.)] and others heaped praise on Castro, calling him warm and receptive during their discussion. But the lawmakers disputed Castro&rsquo;s later statement that members of the congressional delegation said American society is still racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was almost like listening to an old friend,&#8221; said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Il.), adding that he found Castro&rsquo;s home to be modest and Castro&rsquo;s wife to be particularly hospitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my household I told Castro he is known as the ultimate survivor,&#8221; Rush said.</p>
<p>Rep. Laura Richardson (D-Ca.) said Castro was receptive to President Obama&rsquo;s message of turning the page in American foreign policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He listened. He said the exact same thing&#8221; about turning the page &#8220;as President Obama said,&#8221; said Richardson.</p>
<p>Richardson said Castro knew her name and district. &#8220;He looked right into my eyes and he said, &#8216;How can we help? How can we help President Obama?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>President Obama vowed during the 2008 presidential campaign to loosen the longstanding travel embargo on Cuba, and Lee  &mdash;  who has been pushing for an end to travel and trade restrictions for some time  &mdash;  said now was as good a time as any to change the way the two countries did business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement following the meeting today, Castro said that the delegation had expressed to him that a segment of American society &#8220;continues to be racist,&#8221; and is at least partly to blame for the travel restrictions.</p>
<p>But the delegation this evening said those remarks were not expressed in the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;That did not happen,&#8221; Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), told reporters.<br>

			<p>I think black politician types have latched onto Marxism and the wealth redistribution inherent therein because of their racial jealousy, they want to redistribute from white to black.  But when they run things, they&rsquo;re anything but Marxist.  No welfare in Zimbabwe! </p>

			<p>I am all for normal relations with Cuba, as long as that means an absolute prohibition of immigration.  Overstay your visa, and off you go to Castro&rsquo;s jails.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that Fidel would go along with this, he knows that being an illegal on welfare in America is more appealing than being a peon in Cuba.</p>

From what I&rsquo;ve read by the far left, Cuba is a paradise. Why would they WANT the US to get involved with Cuba? Why would they want to taint the Cuban paradise with the filthy gains of western and American style capitalism? If the left believed their own propaganda, they should be demanding the US stay out of Cuba.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than anther anti-white coalition; blacks and browns united to bring down the blue-eyed devil.</p>

			<p>     It&rsquo;s too bad Lasy Astor wasn&rsquo;t along for the ride. She could have asked Castro, &#8221; Why are you killing people ?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oh how they love communism.  I mean, none of the brothers have to compete with anyone to get the basic necessities of life, like a car, food, clothes, etc.  Everybody is regarded the same.  (Except for the ruling elites, of course.)  </p>

			<p>Whatever you think of these backwards communists (and I&rsquo;m not talking about Castro) they do have a point. When the cold war ended with Capitalism triumphant the USA should have been more generous in victory. Once the threat of military domination (promised by the communists as official policy) ended, there was no need for this hardline anti-cuba and pro-democracy stance to continue around the world the way it did. Now the USA finds itself defending these things by war. </p>

			<p>Do you know how to get the CBC to criticize Castro?</p>
<p>If they find out white people are praising him.<br>

<p>In this post, you may have a point. Those of us that have been/served in the Middle East war sort of believe that a big WAL-MART in Iraq would go further to pacification that military intervention. But of course, WAR is just a big government business too.</p>

			<p>I am for normal relations with Cuba as long as it means that all the ex-patriots in Florida would go back.  But Cuba will likely return to being a playground for organized crime, with even better access to the U.S. - yet out of reach of U.S. prosecution.  </p>

			<p>Does anyone think Zuma, Mbeki, or any of the other ANC thugs running South Africa are any less committed to Marxism than Castro? </p>

			<p>Ex Black Panther Bobby Rush regards Castro as an &#8220;old friend&#8221;, after going to Cuba and licking Castro&rsquo;s boots.</p>
<p>The same Rush who wants to strip Americans of their gun rights with his H.R. 45 bill. Castro disarmed his Cuban subjects - that&rsquo;s one reason he stayed in power for 50 years.</p>
