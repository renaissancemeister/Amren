<h1><a href="https://www.norwaypost.no/content/view/21900/1/">Immigrants behind Most Cases of Aggravated Sexual Assault</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rolleiv Solholm, Norway Post, April 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Oslo Police have over the past three years investigated 41 cases of aggravated sexual assault, which resulted in rape. All of them were carried out by non-western immigrants to Norway. </p>
<p>The police now urge that more efforts be put into preventive measures among men with immigrant background.</p>
<p>The police have investigated all reported cases of aggravated sexual assault over the past three years, and have gained a clear impression of the offenders:</p>
<p>Most of the rapists have a Kurdish or African background, NRK reports. The cases of aggravated sexual assults all have one thing in common, namely the use of gross violence. <br>

			<p>I think they need to start some midnight hockey programs immediately, and guarantee that kurds and africans can get jobs and affordable mortgages, and this should disappear overnight.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Most immigrant rapists are either Kurdish or African.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most Rapists in Norway are immigrants or people of color, even though they are only a small percentage of the population. Is that not true? I&rsquo;m sure there is a &#8216;Tim Wise&rsquo; over there though being paid to get right on that and either cover it up or put a constructive spin on it. Probably both. <br>

			<p>Do not believe this story.  Instead believe what the television, the government, and the university professors tell you.  There are NO differences among races.  All races are exactly the same, except that some races are more vibrant or bring new ideas to the table.   </p>
<p>Keep chanting: Diversity is good. Diversity is good.  Diversity is good.  Diversity is good.  Now, pay your taxes, go fight a war for us, and shut up, or we will put you in jail.</p>

<p>The best preventive measure - hint; Don&rsquo;t bring them into your country.</p>

			<p>Immigrants also have more accidents in Norway.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.norwaypost.no/content/view/21626/" rel="nofollow">https://www.norwaypost.no/content/view/21626/</a></p>
<p>Studies by the Institute of Transport Economics (TOEI) show that non-western immigrants to Norway have a higher rate of automobile accidents than drivers born in Norway or Western Europe.</p>
<p>The studies show that men from the Middle East and Africa are twice as likely to have automobile accidents compared to their counterparts in Western Europe and Norway.</p>

			<p>I am surprised that this was even allowed to be published in that paradise of the righteous that used to be known as Scandinavia. Just wait until the feminist schoolmams there get ahold of this!</p>

			<p>Why is this so hard for many to comprehend? THEY (the invaders) break the law just by their presence proving that if it doesn&rsquo;t suit their needs they WILL ignore it. They won&rsquo;t learn the language of a country or abide by it&rsquo;s laws then they make many DEMANDS over what is due to them. The country (s) themselves ALLOW it and in many way seem to encourage this illegal behaviour, then they (the country) cry like little schoolgirls when what they have built is taken away and they themselves become the minority. ENFORCE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ALREADY AND THE PROBLEM WILL BECOME MUCH LESS OF AN ISSUE!</p>

			<p>Henrik Holappa, a man from Finland, tried to call his countrymen&rsquo;s attention to this issue and was convicted of race hatred.  He fled to the USA looking for asylum and got thrown in prison here.</p>

			<p>Why has Norway shot itself in the foot by letting non-Whites into its country?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s obviously due to the Norwegian legacy of slavery.  Oh, what&rsquo;s that?  The Norwegians did NOT enslave Africans or Kurds?  Well then&hellip; it must be due to the legacy of Norse apartheid.  What&rsquo;s that?  The Norwegians had no apartheid?  Well certainly it MUST be due to the legacy of SOMETHING!  After all, leftists cannot survive without some kind of legacy to fall back on.</p>

<p>Leftists can&rsquo;t keep white men down without some kind of legacy to fall back on. The past must be key to the human psyche. Of course using the past to stir up emotion is a sign of hate. At least, using the establishments own definition of the word it is. But that&rsquo;s Ok if you&rsquo;re ever and always rousing hatred for the white man. You just have to be on the lookout for those who would attempt to nulify that, the extreme haters.<br>

			<p>What they essentially did (the goverment) was to abandon it&rsquo;s girls and women and practically give them to the devil, in the name of &#8220;progressiveness&#8221; and &#8220;pluralism&#8221;. The state is an accomplice in this. I wonder if one of these women will ever sue the state for it&rsquo;s part in ruining her life?  </p>

			<p>Norway seems to be heading for self-destruction in a big way. In his latest Brussels Journal contribution, Fjordman quotes Prof. Thomas Hylland Eriksen&rsquo;s view that the most important thing to do right now is to &#8216;Deconstruct the majority population so thoroughly that it can never be called the majority again&rsquo;. Itis predicted that Oslo will soon have a majority of non-Westerners (i.e. Muslims). The Marxist multiculturalist agenda is well underway in every European nation, with little real resistance, especially in Scandinavia - this week&rsquo;s European news shows Swedish towns engulfed in flames as armed Muslims intimidate and attack the Swedes with impunity, and it seems with the acquiescence of their leftist government. This report is an infinitesimal part of a huge problem. Europeans must wake up and repossess their countries before it is too late.</p>
