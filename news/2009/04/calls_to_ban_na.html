			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nursing Times (London), April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of the BNP should be banned from being nurses, according to a motion passed at Unison&rsquo;s Health Care Service Group Conference today.</p>
<p>Delegates voted unanimously in favour of the motion, submitted by the National Nursing Sector, which calls for a law to prevent BNP members becoming nurses.</p>
<p>It also calls for support from the NMC, which states that nurses should not discriminate against patients on the basis of race, but does not ban BNP membership outright.</p>
<p>Proposing the motion, Mick McKeown, nursing sector committee member, said that the racist views of the BNP were incompatible with the public service ethos of nursing.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;The main thrust of this motion is to say that membership of the BNP is completely incompatible with public service, particularly as a nurse within the NHS.</p>
<p>&#8216;Despite how they try and portray themselves, the BNP is a nasty, racist, Nazi party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added that the BNP would discriminate against patients on the basis of skin colour if it ran the health service.</p>
<p>&#8216;They say on their website they would like to give nurses a pay rise  &mdash;  but the other thing they say is that the healthcare should be for the white majority. What they say is British healthcare for British people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr McKeown added that the NHS was founded on immigrant labour and that one of its major strengths has been the diversity of its workforce.</p>
<p>&#8216;The NHS could not have happened without immigration and the contribution of overseas nurses,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>UNISON will now raise the issue with the Department of Health to establish legal powers barring members of the BNP and other racist groups from being members of Unison.</p>
<p>It will also ask the NMC to support its stance and issue interim advice for nurses on the standards expected of them regarding anti-discriminatory practice.<br>

			<p>Hmm.  I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of BNP members working as nurses already.  Now that a membership list has been leaked, they can be &#8220;exposed&#8221; and potentially fired.   As if the knowledge that they are BNP suddenly makes them all potential basket cases who are just dreaming about the day they&rsquo;ll show up to work only to give lethal doses of medicines to all the nonwhite patients in the hospital.  Even though they&rsquo;ve been there for years and have done no harm.  </p>

			<p>Well, then, they better also ban surly minorities with a chip on their shoulder towards white people from nursing professions.    </p>
<p>I must add, probably the main experience contributing to my interest in &#8220;race realism&#8221; was noting the way that my mother was treated by white nurses when she had terminal cancer compared to how she was treated by black nurses and other health care professionals.  </p>

			<p>Who would you rather be?  A non-white under the care of a nurse that is a BNP member, or a white who is under the care of a Muslim nurse who is closely related to someone in an AQ sleeper cell?</p>

			<p>Nurses are race-realists.  They see the consequences of non-Whites&rsquo; behavior every day at work.  Most of the rest of us manage to avoid personally experiencing the diversity that nurses are stuck with.</p>

			<p>Yeah&hellip;.those ballerinas too! We cannot have nasty, Nazis dancing on the stage in front of decent people. Pile up the wood and tie them to the stake, then start the flames&hellip;..burn the BNP members in the village square before their herasies infect the children!</p>
<p>And so they will do to you when it comes their turn.</p>
<p>Because YOU said it was correct to do so.<br>

			<p>I wonder if immigrant nurses would give the same care to a white patient who is a BNP member as to those who aren&rsquo;t.  Heck, I doubt immigrant nurses give ANY white person equal treatment as compared to patients of their own race and religion.  </p>
<p>A close family friend recently had an extremely disturbing experience with his mother passing away in the North of England.  He and his four siblings and their spouses wanted to visit his mom during her last days.  But, the nurses and doctors told them that there was a strict limit of four visitors a day, and everyone had to leave immediately at the end of visiting hours.  When my friend and his siblings pointed out that all of the other patients, who were all foreigners, had loads of visitors at all hours of the day and night, the nurses shrugged and said, &#8220;Well, they&rsquo;re Pakistanis aren&rsquo;t they?  We have to make special allowances based on their religion or else it&rsquo;d be discrimination.&#8221;  His mother   &mdash;   a true Brit who had lived through the London blitz   &mdash;   died alone one night in a hospital surrounded by the smell of curry and the sound of foreign tongues.</p>

			<p>The left isn&rsquo;t totalitarian at all. Nope, nosiree, not at all. They don&rsquo;t want to control what you eat. Or where you live. Or who lives next to you. Or how much of your own money you can keep. Or what you can soend it on. Or what you think&hellip;</p>

			<p>The British National Health Service was founded on immigrant labor?  In the 1940s?  <br>
The Reds have been having their way for so long that they feel free to say the most absurd things.  Does anyone challenge their lies, besides the BNP?  <br>
     Every freakish cult in the West apparently has the backing of the MSM and the government.  Only normal, healthy people are expected to prove what they say, except that they&rsquo;re silenced if they try.  To be a right-winger, you really have to think for yourself, notice that what you see does not agree with what you are told, and form your own opinion.  If right wingers seem to argue amongst themselves a lot, it&rsquo;s likely because we&rsquo;ve had to be independent thinkers.  There&rsquo;s no institutional support for rational thinking, and whole industries devoted to encouraging and exploiting childish feelings.</p>

			<p>a nurse has got to have some brains,so naturally some belong to the BNP.A  nurse can not reveal by her expression or say how she<br>
feels &hellip;.only to a select few with whom she has builtup trust..I,ve been a nurse and conservative for a longtime and I enjoyed my profession very much     </p>

			<p>I read all the comments about this article in The Nursing Times. Here is a simple rebuttal to this anti-BNP movement. You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of the BNP to be refused service at a UK supermarket check-out counter because you have pork products or alcohol in your shopping. The muslims so employed should not be employed, they are in the wrong job. You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of the BNP to be refused hire of an available taxi because you are partially sighted and have a guide dog. The muslims with taxi licences should not have had them granted. You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of the BNP to have your children denied school canteen food unless it meets islamic &#8216;halal&rsquo; codes. Etc Etc Etc. Please feel free to add more, my BNP finger is getting tired!<br>

			<p>British trade unions (thanks to Maggie Thatcher who ritually castrated them - with a blunt and rusty knife!), today have virtually no power whatsoever and have seen a collapse in membership.<br>
 By and large they have degenerated into little more than sub-Marxist talking shops in which failed student politicians (who&rsquo;ve mostly never done a day&rsquo;s labor in their lives), can strut, pontificate, posture and play petty politics to a largely apathetic membership who couldn&rsquo;t care less about the pre-pubescent Che&rsquo; worshippers and their hot air.<br>
 Hence the madness we see above.Ironically it is the same student-union hot-heads who scream the loudest about &#8216;McCarthyism&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>It is illegal to discriminate based on race, it is illegal to intimidate people based on race.  Now when we begin to understand this then the left will have an enemy to be fearful of, but in the meantime we quote IQ studies, they scream &#8220;racist&#8221; (whatever that means, please tell me)and the charade of Western Civ sinks beneath the seas.</p>

			<p>First it was the ballerina. Then the school teacher. Then the policeman and now the nurse. It&rsquo;s not much different than saying, say, immigrants shouldn&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t hold a particular job, or any job in England. They could be onto something there in the UK.</p>

			<p><i>The British National Health Service was founded on immigrant labor? In the 1940s?</i></p>
<p>Maybe not built on them, but it now depends upon them. Why? Because the Britsh NHS doesn&rsquo;t pay good enough wages to attract Britons into the health care field. Talented people also don&rsquo;t want to be government bureaucrats in Britain&rsquo;s run-down medical system. Just one more service your British government provides you. This Mark Steyn column provides some good information on that. 40% of Britain&rsquo;s practicing doctors are now trained overseas, so it&rsquo;s not a problem of white Brits losing out to immigrants for medial school slots. </p>
<p>In 2007 8 British Muslims were arrested in a foiled terrorist plot. 7 were doctors in the NHS and the eighth was a lab technician in a UK hospital. You have the right to not have a BNP member as your doctor or nurse. You do not have the right to not have a Muslim terrorist who hates your white, Christian guts as same.</p>

			<p>sack all BNP supporters I see it now so when they talk about &#8216;foreigners sponging off the system&rsquo; the main 3 can go well nearly all BNP supporters are on the dole, benefits etc. therefore discrediting of them of any issue, even the less controversial ones, that they decide to raise.</p>
<p>I remember a couple of years ago a story hit was in the media spotlight that 80% of nurses graduating from the royal college of nursing could not get work because foreign nurses were being brought in.</p>
<p>As for unions I believe they are used by labour to control the workers, Hence they nearly had a heart attack when the oil refinery workers went on a wildcat strike.</p>

			<p>Just came across this article on the Mail Online.</p>
<p>The title is:</p>
<p>BNP candidate for Europe elections arrested on suspicion of selling illegal firearms</p>
<p>Firstly, suspicion (at least in the States) is not an element of Probable Cause.  As a cop I can&rsquo;t arrest you because you are merely suspicious.  I can watch you but not arrest you.  For Probable Cause, I have to know that a crime has been committed and that I believe YOU committed the crime is question.  That&rsquo;s Probable Cause.</p>
<p>Maybe now a gallows is defined as being an illegal firearm, and this guy David Lucas didn&rsquo;t have any end user certificates for the export police.</p>
<p>Anyway, try this link.  If it doesn&rsquo;t work go direct to todays Daily Mail.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What they say is British healthcare for British people.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So what is wrong with that? British healthcare should be for British citizens, Japanese healthcare should be for Japanese citizens, Indian healthcare for Indian citizens and American healthcare should be for American citizens, same for every other country. The only exceptions being for a foreign tourist or some other  legal visitor or legal resident who happens to get sick or injured in the country. </p>

<p>Same old tired arguement you hear here in the USA. Blah blah, it couldn&rsquo;t be done without immigrants, blah blah. I say bull. Not only could it be done, but it would be a whole lot better if you paid homegrown nurses a fair wage. I can remember when there were few immigrants and things were so much BETTER. The quality was better in the past and everything else.</p>
