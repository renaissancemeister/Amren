<h1>SC College Sued for Discriminating against Whites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meg Kinnard, AP, April 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A historically black college in South Carolina has been sued after three white faculty members say they were passed over for jobs or let go for because of their race, federal officials announced today.</p>
<p>Alleging that Benedict College &#8220;engaged in unlawful practices,&#8221; the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also said today that the Columbia school had also agreed to pay $55,000 to each of the three former instructors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its complaint, the EEOC says art instructor Argiri Aggelopoulou in December 2004 applied for but did not receive a position as assistant art history professor, adding she was instead passed over in favor of a black instructor.</p>
<p>In March 2005, Benedict did not renew teaching contracts for Aggelopoulou and two other instructors  &mdash;  assistant art professor Michael Hale and Katherine Mille, an associate English professor  &mdash;  because of their race, the complaint says.</p>
<p>In a response also filed today, an attorney for Benedict denied any allegations of discrimination and said the school acted in good faith and treated the employees fairly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The College further responds that it embraces diversity and opposes discrimination,&#8221; attorney Carol Ervin wrote, citing part of the school&rsquo;s mission statement, which states &#8220;Benedict College is an equal opportunity educational institution. We seek geographic, international, and racial diversity in our student body.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to its Web site, Benedict is a private, coed liberal arts school with more than 2,500 students with a &#8220;continued commitment to facilitate the empowerment, enhancement, and full participation of African-Americans in American society.&#8221;<br>

			<p>While I am glad they won their case, the article did not mention anyone being fired for the discrimination! Justice was NOT served to the fullest at all. We can expect more of this in the future when are numbers really start to dwindle.</p>

			<p>The first order of business when blacks are in charge of any organization is to force out whites and promote  blacks whenever possible. They are shamelessly racist in making all higher echelon positions closed to white applicants, it&rsquo;s a pattern that is repeated without exception.</p>

			<p>If historically black colleges want to discriminate against whites or anyone else, then they should have that right, as long as they do not get any tax moolah. How many of them do not? I would like to know.</p>

<p>Of course, if the school required competency testing of all it&rsquo;s professors as a condition of continued employment, the entire staff would be white.</p>
<p>Blacks are the most discriminatory race on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>How sad it is they don&rsquo;t have their own country to destroy instead of living in one where they&rsquo;re more apt than not to bring down the white population with them.</p>

			<p>No surprise here.</p>
<p>This is the same idiotic HBCU which bases 60% of a students grade SOLELY BASED ON SHOWING UP FOR CLASS!</p>
<p>Remember folks, these are the future affirmative action health care hires that will be taking care of us in our golden years.</p>

			<p>I may be going against the grain here but I don&rsquo;t have a problem with a black school having all black professors.  I once heard Jared Taylor say he opposes forced integration and supports the free association of people.  His meaning, as I understood it, was that whites should be free to choose whites only and blacks, etc. should be free to do the same.  Why on God&rsquo;s green earth would whites even want to work at a black school?  Are they that bad?  Can&rsquo;t find a job anywhere else?    </p>

			<p>$55,000 each?  That&rsquo;s nothing compared to what non-black institutions typically pay for discrimination against blacks.  Re: April 10, of course they should have the right to discriminate and keep their schools all black - as long as they don&rsquo;t take taxpayer money.  People should not be forced to support, with their hard-earned cash, institutions that exclude them or discriminate against them.  Government should never be in the business of education.</p>

			<p>I have a problem with this too since this is a private college.  If a private college only wanted to have whites (students and teachers) and another private college only wanted blacks (again, students and teachers) it should be their discretion.</p>

			<p>RE: Anonymous 2:28 AM  April 11  &mdash;  Benedict College may very well be a private college, but it is up to its nose in all sorts of Federally subsidized edjukashn grants and loans, therefore it is not &#8220;free&#8221; to discriminate. Once its lips touch the Federal teat (however tangentially) its &#8220;freedom&#8221; to engage in a wide variety of institutional behaviors is gone.</p>

			<p>A private organization should be allowed to discriminate.  That is particularly the case when the private enterprise involves citizens voluntarily engaging in a close-knit endeavor, such as living and learning together.  I fully support this college&rsquo;s decision to discriminate against White faculty.  I don&rsquo;t have much sympathy for any White person who chooses to teach at a college set up for black students.  These White facutly were undoubtedly guilt-ridden liberals to have worked at such a college.  They got what they had coming to them.  Of course, I fully support the rights of private organizations to remain exclusively White.</p>

			<p>Since we&rsquo;ve come to value competition so highly in this country, why not create a new kind of &#8220;March Madness&#8221;?<br>
Let&rsquo;s have a &#8220;mental madness&#8221;.  Invite every institution of higher learning in the country to participate thru written examination and indiviual questioning.  Teams would be formed according to &#8220;tryouts&#8221;, just like in sports. The finals would be conducted in the same way as the NCAA playoffs, with the winner being crowned &#8220;national champion&#8221;.<br>
Wouldn&rsquo;t this be a terrific way to showcase both the abilities of the colleges to teach (after all, isn&rsquo;t that what college is for?&hellip;), but also to demonstrate that there is no lack of intelligence along racial lines???</p>

			<p>Canbtjumpcantspell  &mdash;  Nothing new there in your proposals. They used to call that TV program &#8220;COLLEGE BOWL&#8221; in the late fifties and early sixties. Alan Luden, I believe, was the name of the MC/moderator. I just don&rsquo;t recall seeing any teams fielded by HBUCs though.  </p>

<p>This does not apply to black colleges. The area surrounding Columbia, S.C. where Benedict is, is totally black now and the crime statistice reflect that, along with abandoned businesses and the usual decay. I go through there on my motorcycle every now and then for a rush of adrenalin. </p>
