<h1>Labour Shortage Forces Canadian Immigration to Keep Borders Open</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gareth McConnell, Global Visas (London), April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Canada is facing a long-term labour shortage so the government is not going to turn off the immigration tap,&#8221; this the message from Canadian immigration minister Jason Kenney.</p>
<p>Following a lengthy review and consultation of Canada&rsquo;s economy and employment levels throughout the country, the number of Canadian visas being made available to people who want to move to Canada in 2009 will remain at a staggering 250,000.</p>
<p>There was debate earlier in the year when the global recession began to take a hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want people coming to Canada and facing unemployment. We need to be sensitive to the changing labour market, and if we need to make modifications, we will,&#8221; Minister Kenney explained at the time.</p>
<p>Meetings with provincial counterparts at the end of March proved there are thousands of opportunities still begging to be filled by immigrants wanting to work in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minister Kenney has determined that the need for immigration to Canada remains strong. Immigration numbers for 2009 will therefore remain at 250,000,&#8221; a Canadian immigration official stated.</p>
<p>The need to continue issuing so many Canadian work visas is a result of the developing economy and aging workers retiring. British Columbia and Alberta alone are going to need an additional 600,000 foreign workers over the next five years.</p>
<p>Canadian immigration remains one of the most rewarding in the world. After only three years working in Canada the visa holder is eligble to begin applying for citizenship.<br>

			<p>There are no drastic labour shortages in Canada. White &amp; skilled persons have been hard hit by the current recession. There&rsquo;s no need for immigration at this time (and in the forseeable future). But as it&rsquo;s a minority Conservative government, they don&rsquo;t dare turn off the third-world immigration taps, lest they be accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

<i>&#8220;Employment declined by 61,000 in March, all in full-time work. This decrease pushed the unemployment rate up 0.3 percentage points to 8.0%, the highest rate in seven years.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>There is something very seriously wrong in Canada if the government is lying about needing more warm bodies, because of a labor shortages.</p>
<p>The Canadian economy is being hit as hard as any other in the world today, and their future is one of economic turmoil as great as the US.</p>
<p>It will do no good to pressure these government types, because they&rsquo;re like the New York Times.  They would rather pursue an ideological agenda and collapse, rather than readjust in order to survive.</p>
<p>All we need to do is wait, watch and be prepared.  It&rsquo;s all coming down all on its own.  <br>

			<p>This is all a canard. The truth is ethnic lobbies have taken over control of Canada&rsquo;s immigration policy and are calling all the shots.</p>

			<p>Unbelievable.  The unemployment rate in Canada is increasing as fast as that of the U.S.</p>
<p>Canadian governments use immigration as an economic stimulant; immigrants buy things and need houses to live in.  Banks, speculators, and the wealthy elites are holding the government&rsquo;s feet to the fire to keep the immigrants coming.</p>

			<p>Is there any Western country that is not promoting colonization by non-Western people? The motives may differ: financial benefits for the rich, revenues for the governments, Diversity for the Liberals, but the results are the same. Indigenous citizens who point out the social and environmental consequences are ignored or vilified.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Immigration is both a Ponzi Scheme and a form of &#8216;fractional finance&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are two ways of &#8216;growing&rsquo; an economy. One is to get people to buy more things. That requires people having money to spend which requires wages increasing (which isn&rsquo;t happening). The second way is to bring in more people. Even if they earn little money, lots of them will keep the money flowing.</p>
<p>Of course, like all Ponzi Schemes, there comes a point where it can&rsquo;t support itself anymore and it collapses. Only after it does, we&rsquo;re left with real people who need lots of financial support.</p>
<p>As with slavery, all the people who profit from immigration today won&rsquo;t have to deal with the problems in coming years. They&rsquo;ll die rich. Our children and grand children will forever suffer.</p>

<p>HUH? </p>
<p>Do these people watch the news? The biggest year-over-year increase in people getting Employment Insurance benefits among major metropolitan areas across the country was seen in Calgary, Alberta where the number of EI recipients shot up 114 per cent to a seasonally-unadjusted 11,690.</p>

			<p>I keep wondering: is it stupidity? Insanity? Immorality? Corruption? Treason?</p>
<p>What is it that drives the desire to replace whites in our own countries? And it&rsquo;s happening everywhere. The entire West has been taken over by immigration insanity.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian I can tell you the present conservative government is just like the US republican party.</p>
<p>Traitors true and true.</p>
<p>They continue the fatal immigration policy of the liberals (usa version of democrats).</p>
<p>Jason Kenney is no different than the liberals that started the immigration.</p>
<p>He is just looking for the minority votes that traditionally go to the liberals.</p>
<p>In canada like the usa, there really is no choice.  They are all the same traitors.</p>

<p>Which is it Mr.Kenney? On one hand, you claim there is this drastic need for workers but then you turn around and say you don&rsquo;t want them facing unemployment when they come and will have to make &#8220;modifications&#8221; so they won&rsquo;t face unemployment. If just shows how bogus this all is.</p>

			<p>The Canadian Marxist government is 100 correct on labour shortage but that only applies to Original-Candians (Euro-stock people). In June 2006 A.D.; I waited about 90 minutes at the Vancouver, B.C. International Airport and Customs as scheduled from ending my 13 day Alaskan Holland-American Cruise and landpackage vacation ; taking a flight back to &#8221; crime city &#8221;,a.ka. Motown . What I observed was much worse than I could have imagined; not one airport &#8221; bellhop/lugage handler &#8221; was a White man but were 100 % Oriental Asian males ( I counted 45 individuals ), I&rsquo;ll assume Chinese from Hong Kong.How did they take over all of these type jobs when most just recently arrive from Hong Kong when the British relinguished control of that city to Red China just about 9-10 years earlier ? Anti-White-European Christian race/cultural bigoted &#8221; hate Crime &#8221; against them sponsored by their corrupt, non-representative government, just like in my America.</p>

			<p>On the very same day that this article was posted, here in Vancouver the MSM had an article entitled STATS CAN SAYS ECONOMY SHRUNK IN 2008.  This was after our &#8220;experts&#8221; predicted a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; growth of 4-6%, kind of what they have predicted for this year.<br>
Something is SERIOUSLY wrong here.<br>

			<p>As much as I dislike the liberal (democrat) immigration policies, I shall celebrate when Jason Kenney/Stephen Harper go down to defeat in the next election.</p>
<p>Of course they will both win their seats, but the majority will go to the liberals.</p>
<p>The show continues.</p>

			<p>Labour shortage means there are only 500 instead of 5,000 desperate applicants for every low level job. We&rsquo;ve all read stories about thousands filing out applications for a few openings at a Target or WalMart.</p>
<p>Adam Smith, Karl Marx, David Ricardo and every other economist in the world has said that the more there is of a commodity the less it is valued and the cheaper it can be obtained.</p>
<p>David Ricardo, 18th century English economist, also said that when a group of workers develop a new skill their wages will rise.  But only for a short time because other workers will soon learn the skill and bring down wages again.</p>
<p>Ricardo was writing about the 18th century English &#8220;clever mechanics&#8221;, ordinary workers who developed much of the innovative machinery and methods that created the industrial revolution.  </p>
<p>In this century, White male Europeans and N. Americans created modern technology. Asian, indian and middle eastern workers copied it.  Ricardo and Marx were right.</p>

			<p>There must be some sort of central thought headquarters.  Maybe the elites all have some sort of microchip embedded in the speech<br>
centers of their brains.  Every liberal cause is always parroted all over the world simultaneously.</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal ^ | April 30, 2009 | By FAWN JOHNSON</p>
<p>WASHINGTON   &mdash;   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that increasing skilled foreign workers in the U.S. could mollify housing-price declines that have caused &#8220;the plunge in the value of the vast quantity of U.S. mortgage-based securities.&#8221; Mr. Greenspan said a separate group of workers, illegal immigrants, have made a &#8220;significant contribution&#8221; to the country&rsquo;s economic growth. He called for a temporary-worker program that could make use of that work force in a legal fashion. </p>
<p>&#8220;Unauthorized immigrants serve as a flexible component of our work force, often a safety valve when demand is pressing and among the first to&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation, illegals keep Americans unemployed, the major goal of the federal reserve since 1912.</p>
