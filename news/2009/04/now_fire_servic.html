			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaya Narain, Daily Mail (London), March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pop into the firestation and the chances are there&rsquo;d be a group of reassuringly burly men in there waiting for the call out, with uniforms and firefighting suits tailored for their use alone.</p>
<p>The one or two women among them would have to make do with ill-fitting adaptations of the men&rsquo;s outfits while the handful of Muslim women in the service would be wearing their own head scarfs.</p>
<p>But, with the fire service anxious to attract recruits of all sexes and backgrounds, it was decided that something had to be done.</p>
<p>So yesterday the results were uneveiled, including full-length skirts, hijab headscarfs and long-sleeved shirts for Muslim women recruits.</p>
<p>The hope is that the uniforms, designed for wearing round the station and for outings such as school trips, will be smarter and better fitting for every firefighter  &mdash;  even the men.</p>
<p>For the first time also, women will get their own mustard yellow fire-fighting suit designed to protect their breasts and upper body.</p>
<p>This outfit was tried on yesterday by Lincolnshire firefighter Julie Smith.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is right that male firefighters and female firefighters to need protection in different areas,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;It is very comfortable, very new and very yellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her boss Mike Thomas, Chief Fire Officer for Lincolnshire, declared the uniforms would help &#8216;bust&rsquo; the &#8216;traditional image of the hunky, British, white, male, firefighter&rsquo;  &mdash;  even though a great many of his staff probably fit this description.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are no better positive role models than women and ethnic recruits in these uniforms, and hopefully they will encourage people to join,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Firemen in Lincolnshire will be the first to try out the new national uniform which also includes sports and maternity wear.</p>
<p>Fire minister Sadiq Khan added: &#8216;We want the widest range of applicants to apply to join the fire and rescue service.</p>
<p>&#8216;To achieve this, it is important that all applicants  &mdash;  men and women  &mdash;  know that the uniform and clothing they will be issued with will not only protect them but will also fit properly and be comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8216;The introduction of more appropriately fitted clothing is just one initiative to help to both retain female firefighters and encourage others to consider a fire service career.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The uniform now available shows that cultural beliefs are being recognised, as we seek to increase the representation of ethnic minorities within service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, in England&rsquo;s Fire and Rescue Service only 5.5 per cent of all staff are from a minority ethnic background and 3.3 per cent are women.</p>
<p>Jagtar Singh, spokesman for the Asian Fire Service Association, said: &#8216;We are pleased to note that the fire service is now taking seriously the issues of culture and religious belief when purchasing corporate and protective clothing for firefighters.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>How on Earth do they think that she could fight a fire dressed like that! Other than the headscarf that is almost exactly how I dress but I could not imagine climbing a ladder into a burning building in my long skirts. There really are jobs that are only suitable for men or women who are willing to wear pants. </p>

			<p>Hardly surprising  &mdash;   England after all has been taking the lead in allowing Shari&rsquo;a law and special courts for Muslims throughout its cities. Why is England so passively accepting such a cultural imposition on its own soil? The hijab has been explicitly banned for public uses in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, even in France  &mdash;   they all know what kind of a threat the hijab and the Muslims represent. Why is Britain knuckling under? We need the BNP in there.</p>

			<p>This is preposterous! I used to be a lifeguard, and I know bloody well that if you&rsquo;re encumbered by your clothing, there&rsquo;s no way you can carry rescues out in a timely fashion. Must public safety and innocent lives be sacrificed on the altar of multiculturalism? And let&rsquo;s not forget that a Muslim woman firefighter may refuse to administer first aid, including AR &amp; CPR, to a male victim, on the grounds that such &#8216;intimate&rsquo; contact with a male outside her family is against her religion. God help Britain!</p>

			<p>I guess you didn&rsquo;t read the memo sent out a while ago that Dhimmi Britain has been dead for a while.</p>
<p>I mean, c&rsquo;mon, who would actually want a &#8216;hunky, British, white, male, firefighter&rsquo; to save your life, when you could have a tiny, weak, pregnant, Muslim, female with a floor length skirt on (which will catch fire as soon as she enters the burning building) give it a shot.</p>
<p>Get with the program here. As long as the &#8216;correct&rsquo; skin color, gender, sexual orientation, religion and lack of strength are all present, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you go up in flames or not. After all, you&rsquo;re only white and white doesn&rsquo;t count anymore.</p>
<p>This is why you should read all those memos&hellip;</p>

			<p>I called my husband in to look at the picture and he said it had to be a joke. It IS a joke, unfortunately is is a true one, and one that will cost lives before this nonsense is stopped. I&rsquo;ve worn long dresses, and I can tell you with utter certainty that a person doesn&rsquo;t have the agility or freedom of movement needed to climb ladders, go out windows carrying a helpless or wounded person, or do many other physical manuevers required of firefighters in performance of their duties, when wearing a dress. The Britons have lost their minds.</p>

			<p>Asian Fire Service Association? Are asian fires different? I think we Englishmen have been fighting fires without asian help since lessons were learned following the great fire of London. This muslim dress is a joke. It won&rsquo;t instil confidence in our Fire Service having this spectre hanging around our children on school visits. Looks like something out of Sleepy Hollow.</p>

			<p>The biggest concern is when these women get the jobs who will die because of them? After all, how fast can you shimmy up a ladder when you&rsquo;ve got 10 yards of heavy fabric wrapped around your legs? And what about them not being allowed to touch men?   And what if the man is trapped inside a burning pig farm? Will she refuse to go inside to rescue him?  What if the alarm goes off and she refuses to get in the truck b/c it&rsquo;s one of her mandatory praying times?</p>
<p>On one hand, it&rsquo;s absurd to think they&rsquo;re bending over backwards for Muslims like this, but it&rsquo;s also very terrifying to think they&rsquo;re serious about this. </p>

			<p>You have to admit, wouldn&rsquo;t those who start the fires be the ones most able to control them?</p>

			<p>How much did the tax payer have to fork-out for the fancy design consultants who no doubt designed this joke of a uniform, and how many muslim women are, or want to be, firemen?</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, no-one could fight fires in this. It&rsquo;s just a PR exercise to show how politically correct they are.</p>
<p>The (very few) muslim women firemen will just be trotted around the schools in this costume to help brainwash the kiddies.</p>

<p>Apparently the uniform is not actually supposed to be used while fighting a fire, but it is nonetheless an utter waste of time and money. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a headscarf or skirt, it shouldn&rsquo;t be provided by the station. Not to mention that designing new uniforms just for the one or two Muslim woman who might happen to sign up is ridiculous.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed which is consistant, Pakistanis encroaching on the West are almost giddy when they talk about their people in the ascendancy, behind the deceit of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;.       </p>
