<h1>Polish Migrant Workers Leave Britain in Droves</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claudia Blume, Voice of America News, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Poland and a number of other Eastern European countries joined the European Union in 2004, Britain experienced one of the largest single waves of immigration the country has ever seen. More than one million Eastern Europeans  &mdash;  most of them Polish  &mdash;  came here to profit from Britain&rsquo;s booming economy. While the &#8216;Polish plumber&rsquo; has become something of a symbol for the new immigrants, Polish workers play an important part in all areas of the British economy, particularly in the construction, hospitality and catering sectors. Now, as a recession looms over Britain, Polish workers are leaving the country. Claudia Blume reports from London.</p>
<p>Grzegorz Mrozek is talking to an employment adviser at a London charity. The Polish construction worker is desperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost the job, I think maybe lose the house, homeless  &mdash;  very difficult,&#8221; said Mrozek. &#8220;Maybe next month I will move to Poland.&#8221; </p>
<p>The charity offers free meals to unemployed migrants like Grzegorz Mrozek. More and more Polish workers have lost their jobs since Britain started to slide into a recession. New ones are hard to find. Janie Kidston manages the employment project UR4JOBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is much, much harder now, particularly in construction, particularly in manufacturing and particularly in things like cleaning, which were the main areas of work where we were sending people,&#8221; said Janie Kidston.</p>
<p>When the British economy was booming, it was easy to find jobs, for example as construction workers or painters. Hundreds of thousands of Poles moved to the U.K. when Poland joined the European Union in 2004. Polish businesses, restaurants and shops are now a common sight throughout the country. But the boom times are over, and many Poles are returning home.</p>
<p>Krzysztof Trepczynski is head of the economic department at the Polish embassy in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the peak was at the beginning of last year when there were 700,000-750,000 Poles in the UK,&#8221; said Trepczynski. &#8220;And since that time we see a slow downturn trend. Our estimation is that at present there are about half a million Poles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trepczynski says rising unemployment is not the only reason for the exodus. The exchange rate is another, particularly for those sending money back to Poland.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we joined the European Union, [the] British pound was almost seven Polish Zloty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Last year it dropped down for a little more than four Polish Zloty. It means the salary receipt here by Poles automatically was less in Polish Zloty for [by] about 30 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trepczynski says that another incentive for returning home is that the Polish economy is still doing relatively well. While a number of Eastern and Central European countries will experience an economic slowdown this year, Trepczynski says Poland&rsquo;s projected growth rate for 2009 is still a robust 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>Not everyone, of course, is thinking about going home. Many Poles have established successful careers and businesses in Britain, such as solicitor Jacek Krawczyk-Talikowski, who specializes in the legal needs of the Polish community. He is busy, in spite of the economic downturn, but says the focus of his work has changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to have more clients interested in business development  &mdash;  setting up the companies, taking loans, thinking about future development thinking about new business initiatives  &mdash;  now I am beginning to have lots of companies, lots of clients who are either pursuing debts or in terms of individuals, I have a lot of employment law cases,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yet he and many of his fellow countrymen still see their future in Britain. So despite a growing exodus, the Polish community will remain a part of British society.<br>

<p>We won&rsquo;t see that about Africans orMuslims, because they&rsquo;re too dense to understand jobs are going to be scarce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the smart ones that leave.</p>
<p>Same thing here in the US.  The Mexicans are sitting tight waiting for amnesty, not realizing that, amnesty or not, there&rsquo;s still going to be few jobs to pick over, and the ones they might get are going to cause them to be despised for taking just a few at sub-standard pay, bringing down what amounts to low wages even lower.</p>

The Polish prove themselves to be an honorable people and live by the rules of &#8216;temporary&rsquo; workers. They would rather return to their homeland than stand in the dole que.</p>

			<p>This article describes one of the benefits of the E.U. Labo(u)r can move freely inside the E.U. to wherever it was most needed. This story shows that the system is working, as it used to in the U.S.</p>
<p>What causes problems is the huge and growing influx of people from outside the E.U. </p>

<p>Absolutely! This is exactly the problem with admitting so many millions of immigrants from overcrowded failed states like Mexico, India, the Philippines, Somalia, Bangladesh or Honduras  &mdash;   since their home country is an even greater mess, they are the ones most likely to stay in receiving countries like Britain or the United States, commit crimes and cause misery for everyone else. Whereas, more capable, hard-working white immigrants (such as Poles) have other options when Britain&rsquo;s economy collapses  &mdash;   they can go back home, or they can go to other Western countries that are a better fit, since they genuinely work and contribute rather than merely taking from the host society.</p>
<p>Since most Poles also speak German, with many also conversant in Scandinavian languages or French, they can go to many other countries that are closer to their home nation (if they don&rsquo;t return to Poland specifically). Thus, hundreds of thousands of the Poles leaving Britain are now going to Norway (one of the top destinations), the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, France and especially Germany, because these places didn&rsquo;t stake so much of their economy on financial engineering and mass-immigrant cheap labor to begin with. So even if their own economies aren&rsquo;t ship-shape, they still offer more options in tech and manufacturing than Britain does, positions which Poles are able to fill. </p>
<p>You see the same problem elsewhere in the West whenever the Third World population rises too rapidly. In Australia, the rapidly-growing Sudanian, Indian and Pakistani populations stay there even with the Australian downturn, while the white population does more &#8220;shopping around the world&#8221; because they have the skills. Canada&rsquo;s own Haitian, Indian, Moroccan and Somali population is staying put, while the whites there are far more mobile  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just like the demographic shift that took place in Lebanon. And Britain? As the Poles and Ukrainians all leave, it&rsquo;s then left with its growing millions of Africans and South Asians who have no desire to go home. Unless the BNP gains power soon, Britain has thus effectively condemned itself to ruin. Its Lib-Con-Lab politicians failed to grasp the most basic logic governing who goes and who stays in the host countries.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, because no matter how bad the British economy gets, it can&rsquo;t be worse than living and (not) working in their home countries.</p>

<p>Jobs? Who needs a job, when whitey throws everything at you for free!<br>
Why the streets are paved with gold, all you have to do is go up to any law abiding, well dressed white person and shake them and money will literally fall out of them, whilst they plead for  mercy for your amusement. </p>

			<p>East Europeans leave simply because they still have a country to go back to. That cannot be said of africans and indians. They will stay even if Britain turns into a complete mess, since they still will have it much better than in their great and spiritual motherlands. Just go visit indian subcontinent and compare it with any east european country and you will get the point.</p>

<p>The Poles are leaving because they want to work and since there is no work in the UK they leave. The hard working Poles aren&rsquo;t willing to go on welfare like the africans and muslims who have no problem being supported by the &#8220;racist white infidels&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t worry England. The hard working, law-abiding Catholic Poles may be going but you&rsquo;ll still get to keep all those wonderful blacks, Africans, Pakistanis and other Asians that have so enriched your lives. (Sarcasm off).</p>

			<p>  In my own meager experience in academia, I&rsquo;ve known only a very small handful of students from Africa to return to their homelands. Most jump their student visas and get affirmative action jobs meant for American blacks. Some just seem to hang around living on the fringes of society sort of like Obama&rsquo;s aunt. </p>
<p>Many India and Pakistani students find a way to stay as well, but some do return to India. The same is true of Chinese students, although many of them seem to get pregnant while attending the university. Lately, I&rsquo;ve seen more Chinese students return to China   &mdash;  particularly male students. We have few students from either Eastern Europe or Western Europe at my institution.  I would say the vast majority of Japanese and Korean students return to their home countries after graduating. </p>

<p>And that is caused by the EU&rsquo;s policy of taking in non-Europeans to populate the work force because - it is believed - Europeans are not having enough children.  HOWEVER - it is not Europeans or European Americans that are having too few children, it is the third worlders and nations like Indian and China who produce far too many people for less and less resources.  The capitalist model needs to always expand to work.  But there is a limit to how far anything can expand in a finite space.  What we need is population control world-wide, not economic systems that ruin the highest acheiving nations.  Ways must be found to halt unrestricted baby making world-wide.  If we do not suceed in this - nature will force it on us eventually.</p>

			<p>They are the wrong people to be leaving. They are also the right people to be leaving.</p>
<p>They are the wrong people to be leaving because they, at least, were an example of a white group that is immigrating to Britain - a mostly honest, hardworking group, at that. They could help keep Britain white going into the future. Without them the island&rsquo;s future gets blacker (literally and figuratively) by the minute.</p>
<p>They are also the right people to leave. Britain still has an immigration problem it needs to fix. That problem won&rsquo;t go away until laws change and expulsion begins. The darker Britain remains the more obvious that fact is. An economic downturn is the time when there is the most pressure to change the laws and the culture. Britain has already experimented with the multicultural socialistic welfare state, so conservativism is (hopefully) the only place left to turn to.</p>

			<p>But, they are not leaving:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that the peak was at the beginning of last year when there were 700,000-750,000 Poles in the UK,&rdquo; said Trepczynski. &ldquo;And since that time we see a SLOW downturn trend. Our estimation is that at present there are about HALF A MILLION POLES.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That means that the majority:two thirds,are remaining and they keep coming.</p>

			<p>The Poles will go home because they are workers and if there is no work they will leave.</p>
<p>The Third Worlders however have no interest in working - just scrounging and thieving.</p>

<p>Yes, Nulabour got the figures wrong on this one - by around 700,000 to be exact.<br>
Oh, and Darling Alistair, our cowboy Chancellor (no qualifications in economics, but who cares anymore?) today tells us that he got it wrong on the depth of the UK bankcruptcy.</p>
<p>Oh, and I forgot - every 4 years immigration is equivalent to a city the size of Birmingham.<br>
Our hospitals, schools, roads can&rsquo;t cope any longer.<br>
Our colleges have no money left for new buildings although we are in desperate need of retraining.<br>
Also, many of our elected representatives have been on the make with their snouts so far into the trough that you can&rsquo;t see their tails anymore (even our &#8216;Minister in Charge of Foreign Invasions&rsquo; has allegedly been taking money out of the till for bogus extra homes allowances).<br>
And yes&hellip;.oh, what&rsquo;s the point, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to go on.<br>
Little Britain - RIP.<br>
Nulabour - the second word is, &#8216;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The blacks and muslims will not go home no matter what!! they don&rsquo;t care about work, they get everything free in Britain and back in their own countries they would really BE slaves. They will never leave voluntarily, so FORCE them to.</p>

			<p>poles, like most europeans, are ashamed, and disrespect of social programs (welfare). Here in chicago, same sitaution.  many of the polish males are laid off in jobs, esp non union construction.  They will take unemployment benefits and thats it.  No welfare. For Blacks, latinos and muslims welfare is a way of life, and living.  they work cash jobs and collect welfare at the same time, especially latinoes.</p>

			<p>Addendum:<br>
Further to my posting regarding Nulabour ministers with snouts in troughs&hellip;.<br>
Breaking news: Alistair Darling, Global Gordon&rsquo;s right arm man, is being christened &#8216;Five Homes&rsquo; by the British press.<br>
It appears as if Alistair has been claiming money for extra homes from the taxpayers&rsquo; purse and renting out at the same time.<br>
(Alistair Darling officially lives at number 11 Downing Street).<br>
Honestly, you couldn&rsquo;t make this up.</p>

			<p>This Depression has come along just in time.</p>
<p>It will be fun watching all the minority programmes being cut, the public sector non-jobs being axed, benefits being scrutinised, borders beng controlled.</p>
<p>Most fun of all will be to see the immigrants whining/demonstrating/rioting. All those white numpties who voted Labour will be losing their jobs, houses, savings and going bankrupt and regreting ever having supported them while Labour bends over backwards to maintain ethnic &#8220;employment&#8221; levels.</p>
<p>Perhaps, just maybe, the Sheeple will wake up.</p>
<p>Vote BNP. <a href="http://bnp.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://bnp.org.uk/</a></p>

			<p>Poles, more than less have no patriotism to the countries in which they immigrate.<br>
Poles whome I had grown up with in the seventies still today choose to be culturally distinct mainly because Americas Socialist system allows a wide gap in which to form an enclave.<br>
Through my personal interactions with young female Polish parking lot attendents over the course of a year in 2003, I found that the newest generation sees temporary international employment as a means in which to live a happy-go-lucky vagabond lifestyle with the payback being a flight back home with cash money taken out of country.</p>
