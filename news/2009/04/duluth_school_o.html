<h1>Duluth School Officials Charged in Immigration Conspiracy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Gwinnett County residents were indicted Tuesday for operating what prosecutors say was a sham English-language school that was used as a conduit to let immigrants live here illegally.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Songwoo Shim, 47, of Lawrenceville, and In Young Park, 36, of Duluth, falsified documents and illegally obtained immigration approval for dozens of &#8220;students&#8221; who never attended the Duluth school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shim, who managed and operated the center, allegedly obtained approval for the school based on a fraudulent application he submitted to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two defendants then allegedly used the illegitimate school as a vehicle to obtain fraudulent immigration documents for dozens, and perhaps hundreds, of &#8216;students,&rsquo;&#8221; Nahmias said. Most never attended the school, he said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Shim allegedly submitted forged or fraudulently obtained letters from legitimate schools as part of his petition to the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Student and Exchange Visitor Program.</p>
<p>Once the agency approved the Humana Language Learning Center&rsquo;s application in 2006, Shim and Park began getting student visas for aliens who were not entitled to them, prosecutors said. The defendants then provided falsified documents, such as resumes, school transcripts and diplomas, to be used in support of immigration applications, prosecutors said.<br>

			<p>ALL illegal immigrants need to be deported. Including Asian illegals in addition to the Latino illegals. Why should more American jobs be lost to immigration while illegal immigrants contribute to an ever-increasing drain of our tax dollars that have to be diverted for their support.</p>

			<p>What is the justification for allowing in LEGAL IMMIGRANT Koreans? The justification given by LEGAL IMMIGRAATION Enthusiasts is this:We have to imoprt LEGAL IMMIGRANT koreans, otherwise Native Born White America would not be able to produce its own doctors,engineers,computer programmers,accountants,x-ray technicians,nurses,electricians..it is a long list. But this is a bold-face lie. And when a the ofspring of LEGAL IMMIGRANT Koreans hit US with this bold-face lie..immediatetly tell the korean &#8220;American&#8221; that this is a bol-face lie. Follow up with: how Native Born White Americans survive all the decades when there was no korean LEGAL IMMIGRATION? Quite well thank-you.</p>
<p>Of of course the korean &#8220;American&#8221; will respond:&#8221;But your ancestors were immigants also.&#8221; You should respond:You are asking me to view US immigration policy in a even-handed liberal when korean &#8220;americans&#8221; and other post-1965 non-whites do not. The framework of your statement is based upon a lie that I do not accept. </p>

			<p>If and when Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders you can be cetain that the following will never happen:Korean &#8220;American&#8221; family sitting around the dinner table having the following discussion:Korean &#8220;American&#8221; father to his wife and five children:&#8221;You know, now that asians are majority in America, I thnk its time time that asians show that they are not racist. We need to change our asianonly national origins policy and allow in two mliion Euroepan immigrants in a year. Hopefully over time this will make asians a an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders. Anyone who opposes this is a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>You see Ladies and Gentleman..it is all on big lie</p>
