<h1>Out-of-Wedlock Births Hit Record High</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Ravitz, CNN, April 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along with magazine-cover grabbers like Angelina Jolie and Bristol Palin, Hoffman, today a 39-year-old mother of three, is part of a now record-breaking trend of women who give birth outside of wedlock.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of babies born in the United States in 2007 were delivered by unwed mothers, according to data released last month by the National Center for Health Statistics. The 1.7 million out-of-wedlock births, of 4.3 million total births, marked a more than 25 percent jump from five years before.</p>
<p>Statistics such as these, which include for the second year in a row a bump in teen pregnancies, after a 14-year decline, leave Sarah Brown concerned. She worries about the children born to unwed parents  &mdash;  about the disadvantages they often face, including increased likelihood of poverty and greater high school dropout rates. See the number of out-of-wedlock births by race and age »</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish people spent as much time planning when to get pregnant, with whom, under what circumstances as they do planning their next vacation,&#8221; said Brown, the CEO and founding director of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. &#8220;The stigma [of out-of-wedlock births] has eroded, and these numbers made me feel perhaps it&rsquo;s disappeared altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>That stigma Brown speaks of, however, isn&rsquo;t one that LaShanda Henry, 28, or the women in her family before her, would have known. Her parents never married. And her grandmother only had a wedding when she was in her 60s.</p>
<p>So when Henry, of Greenville, North Carolina, and her boyfriend of now five years, Jean Paul, had Christopher two years ago, there was no pressure to race down the aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Culturally speaking&#8221; taking vows wasn&rsquo;t expected, said Henry, who runs the Black Moms Club, an online social network, and the Web-only Mahogany Momma Magazine. &#8220;Do we want to spend that money on a wedding or a house? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I guess it&rsquo;s about priorities. I was never one of those girls that dreamed about the wedding dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>What she said about cultural differences and expectations might help explain some of the numbers. Other data released last month showed the percentage of unwed mothers differs from race to race. While 28 percent of white women gave birth out of wedlock in 2007, nearly 72 percent of black women and more than 51 percent of Latinas did.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s experience also echoes what Paula England, a Stanford University sociology professor, learned when she co-edited &#8220;Unmarried Couples with Children,&#8221; which was published in 2007. That book traced for four years 50 unmarried couples, the majority of them black or Latino, that had babies in 2000, and the findings shot down some of her predictions.</p>
<p>England assumed many of the fathers would have high-tailed it out of the picture by the sixth month of pregnancy, leaving single mothers &#8220;truly single,&#8221; the sociologist said. Instead, she found that in 80 percent of the non-marital births, parents stayed romantically involved and in 50 percent of the cases they were living together.</p>
<p>Still, the bulk of responsibility often falls to the mother. According to a 2008 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 9.8 million single mothers versus 1.8 million single fathers.</p>

			<p>Decades ago liberals and feminists whined that unwed mothers were being &#8220;stigmatized&#8221; by the Christian majority.</p>
<p>Well now that the &#8220;stigma&#8221; against illegitimate births has subsised, we see the calamitous results.</p>

			<p>Add these stats to the high incarceration rates for blacks; the inability of blacks to learn, especially males, causing a high drop out rate and a standard of literacy for the ones who do graduate to be around a sixth to eighth grade level, and you have an unsustainable racial group that is destined to self-destruct.</p>
<p>I could be avoided if these eople were told the truth and pressed to understand that most of them are qualified only for menial labor and excouraged to physical labor that requires low intelligence.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it&rsquo;s the truth, and it needs to be said, because all these PC&rsquo;s have been doing for 150 years now is pretending everybody is the same when a wealth of information and experience blaringly revealing that just the opposite is the case.</p>

<p>I suppose this girl believes she&rsquo;s being clever and witty. I think her statement should be recorded and put into one of those time capsules to show people what this day and age was like. Being able to send her message into the past would prove amusing for an audience as well.</p>

			<p>Just go to any supermarket and look at all the women with little kids who don&rsquo;t have wedding rings on. There are very few families in this country who aren&rsquo;t affected by this out of wedlock childbirth syndrome.</p>

			<p>Now you see a lot of these baby-mommas on Maury Povich looking for the baby-daddy.  There&rsquo;ve been some who&rsquo;ve had like two dozen men tested and STILL can&rsquo;t find the baby-daddy!</p>
<p>You have to wonder if sometimes half-siblings marry or hook up accidentally, because they have no idea who their father is.</p>

			<p>I have worked in social services for a county agency for 20 years and in that time, I have talked to thousands of &#8216;mommas&rsquo; about their criminaly convicted children. In that same amount of time, the number of fathers I have spoken to amounts to less than ten.  Most of my &#8216;clients&rsquo; as management calls them, are black. </p>
<p> Is it any wonder that these things happen? </p>

			<p>Welcome to the new redistribution welfare state.  Within the next decade US will have more state sponsored children than ever in its history.  Along with the lack of parental supervision and love comes dependency, crime and more of same. God&rsquo;s rules no longer apply as Satan rules and state encourages behavior.   V</p>

Yes, it&rsquo;s amusing that Ms. LaShanda Henry thinks that the purpose of getting married to have have a wedding ceremony. </p>
<p>The idea of making a long term commitment of some kind doesn&rsquo;t fit very well in the mind of the average African American.</p>

<p>This is bogus. It costs very little, if anything, to get married. You do not have to have a &#8216;wedding&rsquo; in order to get married. Its a cute little phrase but its stupid. If she really believes this then she is stupid.</p>

<p>I have to respectfully disagree. The point is anymore that this society has completely passed the blacks by in every sector of living. Blacks aren&rsquo;t equipped mentally, or emotionally to do the smallest jobs any longer. You have to understand that all work/jobs has value. Even sweeping and mopping floors takes some intellect and ability. The thing with blacks is this. Suppose a black guy sweeps and mops a floor and says, see, I can do that job. But, that doesn&rsquo;t mean he [will] do the job. Nor does it mean he will do it at the appointed [time] of day. Those are the same for any and all jobs. Reliability. That&rsquo;s where the blacks fall short. Timeliness is not a big deal with black people. Anyone who is in the workforce knows these things.</p>
<p>Take care sir and have a good day.</p>

			<p>The news isn&rsquo;t all bad with regard to Black reproduction, marriage etc.</p>
<p>The Black American fertility rate is way down, close to 2.0 - thus the Black population isn&rsquo;t getting any larger.</p>
<p>No, Black Americans don&rsquo;t get married, live the 1950s American suburban dream and be responsible parents, patriotic, god fearing Americans who vote Republican, wave the flag, hate communism, are model Americans just like us only they have a little more soul.</p>
<p>But, the best news is that America is no longer being endangered by the population explosion of welfare, criminal underclass Blacks.</p>
<p>The reality is that Urban America has learned to handle the criminal, welfare Black plague in other ways - that aren&rsquo;t &#8220;Conservative&#8221;.</p>
<p>birth control, including abortion rights have been very effective.</p>
<p>Instead, White liberals in Cities do the quiet work to network with poor NW women and push the (truth) that underclass Black men are no good, and it is bad for their lives to have lots of children with them and the state will no longer increase welfare payments just because an AFDC woman keeps cranking out kids.</p>
<p>Here is another example where it is right to&hellip;.</p>
<p>Go Left young White man.</p>
<p>Conservatives are mostly clueless went confronting the real problems we face today. It&rsquo;s not 1955. We don&rsquo;t need to waste $ billions on national defense to FIGHT THE RUSSIANS and when dealing with the horrors of the Black, NW threat, Liberal/Left policies work much better than Conservative ones.</p>

			<p>  Unfortunately, the rate of white illegitimacy is increasing as well. It is even higher in some European countries. However, I wonder how many of the white illegitimate births are to a black father and white mother? My guess is the percentage would be statistically significant. Nevertheless, the state has taken over the traditional duties of the absent fathers with increasing social pathology and decay. Whites have nothing to feel good about in the area of unwed mothers. </p>

			<p>Having a baby is not taken seriously in the black community. Its made to be as casual as going to the pet store to buy a turtle. People just are out there messing around not  being se*ually responsible and then a kid just pops up.  People  are recklessly irresponsible and very promiscuous. People only live for the moment. They don&rsquo;t think about the future and how their actions will affect their child. They only care about the se*ual thrill in the heat of the moment. They don&rsquo;t think about how their going to give emotional and financial support when they are unemployed, underemployed, or still live with their parents.   The women won&rsquo;t take birth control, the abortion is the birth control.  I don&rsquo;t understand this when there are free reproductive services  and there are many planned parenthood clinics everywhere. They don&rsquo;t think about what kind of life their child is going to have, how much the child is going to suffer, all of the hardships pain and misery a child will have to endure growing up in poverty in a bad neighborhood in a family that can&rsquo;t support their ambitions or provide opportunities.</p>
<p>Reasons why marriage is so low</p>
<p>Black men are taking advantage of the imbalanced sex ratio that tips in their favor. They are chosing to play the field and not marry especially the ones who have their life together( have their own place, a well paying job, no kids, car etc.) . Black men are the slowest of any race to commit if they do this at all. And when they do commit it won&rsquo;t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Also black women have very low expectations and standards for black men, they play the role of wife without marriage. They will cook, clean, and have half a dozen babies.  Black men have no reason to marry when they can get all the benefits without it.</p>
<p>Women set the standards of how men will behave and until black women get higher standards this problem will continue.</p>
<p>The high level  and acceptance of immorality and irresponsible behavior is very disturbing  and sad.   <br>

			<p>     Perhaps they don&rsquo;t get married because that would get in <br>
the way of welfare benefits. Is it possible? Could people really<br>
be that pecuniary and selfish? Yes. To think otherwise is to not<br>
know life. The real mystery is why Society allows this. And the<br>
real tragedy is the cuckolding of the White Race.</p>

			<p>More than half of Latino children are born out of wedlock yet cretins like George W. Bush love to talk about Latinos&rsquo; &#8220;family values.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white rate of 28% is of course much higher than it should be.  It is a consequence of the steady trend of &#8220;defining morality down&#8221; that has taken place over the decades so as to not make blacks look too bad.  The radical feminists have long had as their goal the destruction of the traditional family.  They have succeeded.</p>

			<p>There are good, long-standing reasons that &#8220;Bastard&#8221; is a pejorative.  Fatherless boys are prone to feral behavior.  In the Odyssey, Odysseus returns home to find that a mob of young men whose fathers have been away at Troy for ten or more years, if they ever returned, have taken the place over.  They abuse his servants and son, and are determined that one of them shall have his wife and property.  When Odysseus shows up, disguised as an old beggar so that the punks don&rsquo;t murder him on sight, they ridicule him.  Taking advantage of their ignorant disdain of a great elder warrior, he kills them all.  Three thousand years ago, the Greeks knew that untutored boys came to no good.  That hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>Yesterday in my Business English class, the mulatto woman in my group came in (ten minutes late, as always) and said that she was &#8220;so excited&#8221; because she deliberately did not pay her rent. She has young children, and was excited about not paying her rent. Stunned, I asked why, and her reply infuriated me: &#8220;That way I can take the eviction notice to Family Services, and they cut me a check! I&rsquo;m so good at getting free money!&#8221; </p>
<p>I stared down at my hands and said &#8220;is this what my taxes pay for?&#8221; The mulatto laughed and said &#8220;of course.&#8221;</p>
