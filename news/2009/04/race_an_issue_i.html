<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In life, the playwright August Wilson had an all-but-official rule: No white directors for major productions of his work.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The selection of [white director Bartlett] Sher by the producer, Lincoln Center Theater, has prompted concern and even outrage among some black directors, who say this production [of &#8220;Joe Turner&rsquo;s Come and Gone,&#8221; which opened on April 16] represents a lost opportunity for a black director, for whom few opportunities exist on Broadway or at major regional theaters. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve learned more from this cast than any group that I&rsquo;ve ever worked with,&#8221; said Mr. Sher, who won a Tony for &#8220;South Pacific.&#8221; &#8220;But I also learned an enormous amount about the lack of opportunity in theater today. More Ibsen should be directed by black directors. More Shakespeare. More Chekhov.&#8221;</p>

			<p>What timing.</p>
<p>I happen to have been forced to read this playwrights garbage for my English 102 class. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fences&#8221;, a play done by this very man, is a horrible story anyway. Any white that&rsquo;d actually want to direct his &#8216;plays&rsquo; is nutty. </p>

<i>&#8220;More Ibsen should be directed by black directors. More Shakespeare. More Chekhov.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>And just how will this make these plays better? Will blacks infuse them with their historic anger and victimization? Will they uncover THE TRUE meaning hidden by white directors and the white playwrights themselves?</p>

			<p>  I just wonder how many blacks go to these shows? I bet not many, otherwise it would be like going to a &#8220;Spike Lee&#8221; movie in Oakland.</p>

			<p>Makes total sense to me&hellip;..since August Wilson (born as Fredrick August Kittle, Jr.)is the son of a German immigrant baker and a black woman from North Carolina. His mother remarried when he was a teenager and he moved to an all-white working class neighborhood in Pittsburg. He was the only black student at Central Catholic High School. He switched to a vocational school and finally dropped out of school altogether after being caught plagiarizing a paper. He died of liver cancer in 2005&hellip;so naturally he is a genius.</p>

			<p> Who says there are few opportunities for black directors? Where is the evidence for that bald assertion? And why should black directors be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov, when their plays have nothing to do with blacks? If White directors shouldn&rsquo;t be in charge of August Wilson&rsquo;s work because it&rsquo;s about blacks, then shouldn&rsquo;t the opposite be true also?</p>
<p> Maybe if black directors feel they have few chances on Broadway, they should go into another line of work. Or better yet, migrate to their ancestral homeland, where there is presumably a shortage of White directors.</p>

			<p>Blacks and other minorities have been directing White themed works for years.  Hollywood, in its never ending quest for diversity, gave us Ang Lee&rsquo;s (Asian) &#8220;Sense and Sensibility.&#8221;  Antoine Fuqua (Black) directed &#8220;King Arthur.&#8221;  I love to see blacks turn their anger on the most liberal of groups.  The arts of infested with PC.  If blacks aren&rsquo;t getting work in this area, its because they really, really suck.  </p>

<p>This is why we now have a black in charge of the U.S. government, because it is all about the blacks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In life, the playwright August Wilson had an all-but-official rule: No white directors for major productions of his work&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So naturally he was a great guy, humanitarian and a seeker of racial justice.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine there are all that many black theater directors.  So the simple solution to this problem is to honor Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s wishes.  If you are white, refuse to put on his plays.  Let his work just disappear from the reperatoire - let his work perish for all time.</p>
<p>&#8220;More Ibsen should be directed by black directors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, less Ibsen should be directed period - by directors of whatever color.  Ibsen was one of the original self-hating, anti western civilization culture wreckers.</p>

			<p>So, now that Obama is in the &#8216;White House&rsquo; can I (as a white male) be hired for Porgy in Porgy and Bess, here in the USA? </p>
<p>Hell, no! Even though these roles are done in blackface in Germany, and asians do it in (what? &#8216;brownface&rsquo;?) in the Far East, here in the USA, I CANNOT sing this role in any production, becuase of Gershwin&rsquo;s racist biases&hellip; even though finding an operatic basso who is black is a rarity, outside of major metro areas.</p>
<p>This is what finally woke me up to the race hustling blacks engage in DAILY. They ALWAYS want special favors for THEM, and NEVER allow YOU (if you&rsquo;re White) to even be on the PLAYING FIELD.</p>
<p>Expletive deleted hypocrites.</p>
