			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer D. Jordan, Providence Journal, April 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tom Tancredo, former congressman from Colorado, Republican presidential candidate and outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, is scheduled to speak in Rhode Island on Wednesday. But he will not be addressing students at Providence College as he had originally planned, after college officials rejected a request from a student group to invite him to campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The student group, Youth for Western Civilization, asked PC officials if they could also host Tancredo, but the request was denied, said PC spokeswoman Pat Vieira.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not an officially recognized group,&#8221; Vieira said. &#8220;They asked very late in the semester when there was not enough time for the request to go through the usual channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as important, Vieira said, were Bishop Thomas J. Tobin&rsquo;s views on immigration and how immigrants  &mdash;  whether here legally or illegally  &mdash;  should be treated, which contrast sharply with Tancredo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bishop of Providence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a member of the college&rsquo;s Board of Trustees,&#8221; Vieira said in a written statement. &#8220;If a similar request to host a speaker on this topic is made in a future semester, the college will encourage and facilitate a format that allows for multiple points of view to be expressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorman [Terry Gorman, executive director of RIILE (Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement)] said he and other anti-illegal immigration advocates are angered by the college&rsquo;s refusal to allow Tancredo to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;This college allowed Senators [Ted] Kennedy and [Sheldon] Whitehouse to speak, and they are virulently pro-abortion,&#8221; Gorman said. &#8220;That goes against Church teaching, but they were invited to campus.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Providence College will not let Tancredo speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most bigotted institutions in the world are so-called institutes of higher education, known by the aware as mind-conditioning factories that stifle free thought and opinions they don&rsquo;t agree with.</p>
<p>I just read an article yesterday outlining universities that were just now beginning to suffer budget shortfalls.  If the experts are right, and I don&rsquo;t see why they wouldn&rsquo;t be, academia will be shreiking hysterically when the hammer drops on their social engineering projects and courses.  (Better known as degrees for dummies.)</p>

			<p>It sure is interesting how whenever somebody on the far left is invited to give a talk at a university, whether that person is a white hating black nationalist, an Atzlan advocating Hispanic radical, a man hating lesbian feminist, or just an old fashioned Marxist, the speaker is never required to debate somebody with an opposing view.  But a man can&rsquo;t be allowed to speak who has the perfectly sensible view that immigration law should be enforced unless equal time is given to an opposing speaker.<br>

			<p>Remember when campus marxists wanted &#8220;free speech?&#8221;  That was before they came to power.<br>

			<p> Providence College has an active Multicult program and has had speakers that back this ideology as well as a national speaker who supports White Privilege. The &#8220;leaders&#8221; of the Catholic Church and their social beliefs are the reason many are leaving the church. Bishop Tobin is very much like a believer in Islam in that he sees religion as a vehicle to overcome secular laws he dislikes. Which are the next ones he chooses to ignore.<br>
 Christ said &#8220;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar&rsquo;s and unto God that which is God&rsquo;s&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Whether you are an Obama fan, or not, EVERYONE IN THE U. S. needs to know. </p>
<p>H.R. 1388 was passed yesterday, behind our backs. You may want to read about it. It wasn&rsquo;t mentioned on the news.It just went by on the ticker tape at the bottom of the CNN screen. </p>
<p>Obama funds $20M in tax payer dollars to immigrate Hamas Refugees to the USA . This is the news that didn&rsquo;t make the headlines.</p>
<p>By executive order, President Barack Obama has ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in &#8220;migration assistance&#8221; to the Palestinian refugees and &#8220;conflict victims&#8221; in Gaza. The &#8220;presidential determination&#8221;, which allows hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with ties to Hamas to resettle in the United States, was signed on January 27 and appeared in the Federal Register on February 4.  </p>
<p>To verify this for yourself:   &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  &gt; www.thefederalregister.com/d.p/2009-02-04-E9-2488</p>
