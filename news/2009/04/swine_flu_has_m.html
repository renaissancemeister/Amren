<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If his future weren&rsquo;t on the line, Cal State Fullerton student Carlos Reyes says, he wouldn&rsquo;t be flying to Mexico. Not with swine flu loose and having killed nearly 150 people there.</p>
<p>Nothing short of becoming a legal resident  &mdash;  and eventually, an American citizen  &mdash;  could compel him to go right now. On Monday, Reyes went to the campus health center and asked if there were any shots he could take to protect himself. There aren&rsquo;t. So tonight, Reyes, 27, will step onto a plane at LAX armed with surgical masks, sanitizers and two boxes of hand wipes that his even more anxious parents bought for him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As cases of swine flu and the number of deaths have swelled in Mexico  &mdash;  and begun to appear in other countries  &mdash;  Southern California&rsquo;s vast Latino immigrant community has been increasingly on edge and questioning whether traveling there is a good idea. The U.S. government recommended that people not go to Mexico unless it is necessary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t even go there as a joke,&#8221; Bertha Dominguez, a native of Mexico City, said as she took a break from shopping in Huntington Park. &#8220;I would maybe go if an emergency presented itself. Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dominguez said the epidemic was just the latest reason not to return her home country, on top of a flagging economy and a gruesome drug war.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, poor or rich, they&rsquo;ll take care of you if you get sick,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&rsquo;d rather get sick here.&#8221;</p>
<p>At El Mercado, a bazaar and indoor swap meet in Boyle Heights, Peruvian immigrant Armando Parodi, 50, said he canceled a trip this weekend to the state of Tlaxcala in Mexico, where swine flu has been reported. He had planned to go to a fair where vendors sell baby Jesus figures  &mdash;  like the ones clad in papal and Aztec outfits he peddles here  &mdash;  but changed his mind because of the swine flu.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Fernando Martinez, 26, owner of Antojitos Chilangos Mexican restaurant in Highland Park, said he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to travel to his native Mexico City, or elsewhere in Mexico. &#8220;If someone gave me the money, I&rsquo;d go there right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about as long as you stay away from places you&rsquo;re not supposed to be at.&#8221;</p>

And if the US medical system doesn&rsquo;t heal them faster than Jesus, they can always sue for racism and discrimination.</p>
<p>America, what a county.</p>

			<p>They all want to live in America but when they get here all they do is talk about how great Mexico is. I could never understand that about Mexicans. LOL<br>
At the moment no one is certain why swine flu has spread so rapidly in Mexico but I suspect it is due to lack of hygiene education. Try not to worry too much about it, I suggest staying away from known infection areas. </p>

			<p>Yet another similarity between Obama and Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>The last big swine flu scare was in 1976, when the left wing peanut farmer was president.</p>

<p>First U.S. swine flu death is Mexico City boy in Houston</p>
<p>By DALE LEZON, BRADLEY OLSON and TODD ACKERMAN Copyright 2009 Houston Chronicle<br>
April 29, 2009, 1:19PM</p>
<p>&#8220;The first reported death in the United States from the swine flu outbreak was that of a 23-month-old Mexico City boy who fell ill in Brownsville and was transported for treatment at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Houston, where he died Monday, officials said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The State of Texas will reimburse the hospital just 10 percent of the cost of treating this boy and the hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who will swarm over the border to US hospitals for free treatment.</p>
<p>With affirmative Action in health care soon to come, White Americans may soon be denied care so these non White invaders can be treated.<br>
