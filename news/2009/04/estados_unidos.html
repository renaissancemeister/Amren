<h1>Estados Unidos? Almost 1 of 2 New Americans in 2008 Was Latino</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics made up nearly half of the more than 1 million people who became U.S. citizens last year, according to a Hispanic advocacy group.</p>
<p>The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said the number of Latinos who became Americans in fiscal year 2008 more than doubled over the previous year, to 461,317. That&rsquo;s nearly half of the record 1,046,539 new citizens overall in 2008, a 58 percent increase from 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latinos who naturalize are eager to demonstrate their commitment to America by becoming full participants in our nation&rsquo;s civic life,&#8221; said NALEO president Arturo Vargas, whose nonpartisan group works to improve the citizenship process and increase Latino participation in civic activities.</p>
<p>NALEO based its findings on Homeland Security Department data on the number of new citizens last year who immigrated from predominantly Spanish-speaking countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, 231,815 people originally from Mexico became citizens, up almost 90 percent from 2007. Increases in citizenship among Latino immigrants from other countries were: 39,871 from Cuba, up 160 percent from the previous year; 35,796 from El Salvador, up 109 percent; 17,954 from Nicaragua, up 120 percent; and 17,087 from Guatemala, a 109 percent rise.</p>
<p>Most of last year&rsquo;s new Hispanic citizens lived in California, followed by Florida.</p>
<p>Vargas cited the data to encourage the Obama administration and Congress to ease the cost of applying for immigration benefits.</p>

			<p>Take a look at <i>Hispanics: a Statistical Portrait:</i></p>
<p><a href="/features/hispanics/index.html" rel="nofollow">/features/hispanics/index.html</a></p>
<p>Obviously, Hispanics should not be favored as for who is allowed to come to America and obtain citizenship. The said statistics, which proove Hispanics are more prone to crime and other social ills, testify to this fact.</p>
<p>Why does our government allow half a million Hispanics to obtain American citizenship but not Europeans? I&rsquo;m certain that there are plenty of Russians, Ukrainians and other eastern European peoples who would like to become American citizens. Why can&rsquo;t they come here in such numbers? Why is a disfavorable ethnic group favored over a more favorable ethnic group that is the same race as ourselves?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to point out the blatant <i>lies</i> by Ted Kennedy: &#8220;First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same&hellip;. Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia&hellip;. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think&hellip;. The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Our rulers have mandated national suicide. Of course there will be a nation, or nations, here 20 years from now, but in cultural tone it will be nothing like the United States of 20 years ago. All the passion has been on the side of the destroyers of Amerika, as they call it. There has been little passion on the part of the preservers. How else explain what has been allowed to happen?</p>

			<p>The United States is going to lose the southwest. Kind of a reversal of the Mexican-American war.</p>

			<p>I had no idea the numbers increased so much in the last few years. Their is only one remedy for this, a moratorium on new immigration and naturalization. That must be done before we can even begin sorting through the mess and deciding who to keep.</p>

			<p>This, plus their sky-high birth rates and the illegals scurrying across the border to whelp anchor babies in vast numbers mean we have lost the southwest unless we do something, and do it soon. Instead of conductine raids in Seattle and the northeast, concentrate on clearing them out of Arizona and Texas border towns.</p>

			<p>The racial transformation of America is occuring at blinding speed. In the near future-very near-the hispanic demographic time bomb is going to explode. Millions of Native White Americans will have no idea what hit them-although they  should have.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better if amnesty was passed as soon aa posible because it would trigge the White revolt much faster. Am I wrong qabout this?</p>

			<p>  These numbers really don&rsquo;t surprise me at all. We have three flea markets in the vicinity of my hometown in southwest Ohio. The numbers of hispanic attendees goes up on a weekly basis. Now there are food stands that cater to the hispanics specifically. The workers speak spanish, take orders in spanish, and are rude to you if you don&rsquo;t order in spanish. I am pretty sure the owner is arab. Not sure how that works, but he looks and dresses like an arab. I commented to another white gentleman to the effect that we were standing in the middle of little Mexico. I can&rsquo;t repeat his reply here, it wasn&rsquo;t very endearing toward our neighbors from south of the border. I enjoyed it. </p>

			<p>Does anyone think Obama is going to lift a finger to stop illegal immigration in the next 4 years (or possibly 8 years).</p>
<p>8 years from now we may have so many illegal immmigrants in the country that we won&rsquo;t be able to stop the flood even if we wanted to. </p>

			<p>We are absolutely, 100 percent going to lose this country.  It&rsquo;s a mathematical certainty.  </p>

			<p>Roller, as a good general rule, the Spanish speakers you describe above are almost all illegal aliens. Those with a green card typically have decent to ok English, they like to speak English, they want to learn more English, and often they want to become citizens. When you see them babbling away in Spanish all the time, that&rsquo;s often a clue that they are illegal aliens. I like the legal Hispanic immigrants a lot better than the illegals and the anchor babies. The legals have to jump through a lot of hoops and are often trying to keep their noses clean.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to Hispanic legal immigrants naturalizing. Legal&rsquo;s legal. Around here, you have to pick your fights. Let&rsquo;s start with the illegals first and then see about the legal ones. I think it&rsquo;s imperative that we start being way more selective about legal Hispanic immigrants. There&rsquo;s a group of them that clearly could make a fine addition to our society, but that&rsquo;s not in general who is coming here.</p>

<p>I think this is true but I do advocate stopping ALL MUSLIMS from coming into the country and kicking out converts, (they&rsquo;re mostly black anyway)</p>

This is a Whie Nationalist web site. White Nationlaist are opposed to the race replacement of Native Born White Americans with the  post-1965 &#8220;good&#8221; immigrants.</p>
<p>Legalizing the &#8220;good&#8221;non-whites means a massive voting for the complete racial dispossession of the majority Native Born White American population.</p>
