			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bryn Mickle, Flint (Michigan) Journal, April 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fourteen children by 13 different women in Genesee County and more than $530,000 in unpaid child support.</p>
<p>Even in a county with $700 million in uncollected child support, Thomas Frazier may hold the unenviable title of biggest deadbeat dad.</p>
<p>After years of dodging support payments, Frazier was thrown in jail this week and given the choice of doing 90 days or coming up with about $28,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before leaving the Flint area in 2002, Frazier amassed court cases for 14 children born since 1989 and has not paid any money on any of his Genesee County child support cases in at least the past six years, according to court records.</p>
<p>Frazier, 42, portrays himself as the victim.</p>
<p>The victim of a system that he says saddled him with debt for children he claims aren&rsquo;t all his and the victim of a poor upbringing that he said caused him to seek affection from older women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to find someone who would love me for me,&#8221; said Frazier, who believes he may have fathered his first child at age 15.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frazier owes Talisha Tyler about $40,000 for a 14-year-old daughter. Tyler said he has never even bought so much as a diaper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Genesee County judge on Thursday ordered Frazier to spend 90 days in jail unless he comes up with $4,100 for Tyler.</p>
<p>Even if he comes up with that money, the judge ordered him to spend 90 days in jail on another case. On top of that, the judge gave him 45 days jail on six other cases.</p>
<p>In all, Frazier is looking at three months in jail unless he comes up with at least $27,900.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frazier doesn&rsquo;t dispute that he owes a sizable amount, but said it was unrealistic for the county to expect him to pay so much support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he believes in his hear that only three of the children  &mdash;  two daughters and a son  &mdash;  are actually his.</p>
<p>The rest, he says, were born of women he may have slept with but who lied and claimed he was the father, giving the court false addresses for Frazier so that he could never show up to contest paternity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frazier said he is unemployed and local officials said they do not know what he does for a living.</p>
<p>Frazier said he was actually on his way back to Flint and planned to use the $5,000 as a good faith payment on his child support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His current jail term aside, Frazier is also looking at further legal woes for his probation violation cases.</p>
<p>Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton is not in a forgiving mood, noting that Frazier was rolling around in Mercedes Benz with thousands of dollars and plane tickets at the same time he wasn&rsquo;t paying his child support.</p>

			<p>The mommas of these children are equally guilty of irresponsible procreation.The welfare system should not give them more moolah to have more kids that only Whitey will support with his taes.</p>

			<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, some deadbeat dads might actually be dead BROKE dads.  I&rsquo;ve heard men over the years complain that so much child support is taken out, they don&rsquo;t have enough to live on, and they can&rsquo;t try to find a better job, because then they&rsquo;ll have to pay out more.</p>
<p>I think $200 a month per child is reasonable&hellip;especially if the mother is on welfare or has a job.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if this guy is tooling around in a Mercedes, it might be time for him to sell the thing and pony up some cash.</p>

			<p>Typical black male. Very juvenile and cares only for himself- hence having an expensive imported car and plane tickets when he has no visible means of support. DNA tests on all 14 kids will tell the tale&hellip; I wonder how may of the women are white.</p>

			<p>At only a year older than Frazier, I have one child by one woman and drive a used Saturn instead of a Mercedes.  I also don&rsquo;t owe anyone half a million dollars.</p>
<p>The fact that the law can not offer Frazier a choice of immediate, complete payment or immediate, forced sterilization and a payment plan can only be described as a crying shame.</p>

			<p>Well I can see from this man&rsquo;s picture how super-delicious he is, no wonder these women couldn&rsquo;t resist him.</p>
<p>Child support laws were not written to apply to these people.  Most white men do not have 14 children by 13 different women.  If this man is supposed to give even a small percentage of his income, presuming he has one, to each mother, he&rsquo;d go broke. </p>
<p>Shame on him, but shame on the women who had irresponsible sex with him too.  Many white women actually have a contraceptive plan in place. </p>

			<p>Of course, the taxpayers will end up footing the bill in legal costs, DNA tests and jail time to sort this mess out. Frankly, I blame the women as much, if not more, than this guy. He didn&rsquo;t do anything they didn&rsquo;t let him do. You lie down with dogs, you get fleas. </p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t throw this man in prison. Make him live with all the women he impregnated. At one time. I guarentee if punishments like that were handed down, there would be a lot fewer men out doing this. </p>

			<p>Instead of throwing him in jail, they should neuter him, his &#8220;babymamas,&#8221; and the offspring. It&rsquo;d certainly be more cost effective in the long run.</p>

			<p>      It just amazes me that girls have sex with people that they should obviously expect has no real ambition or earning potential. Then expect child support. It would be like us expecting the homeless man to pay us back or wash our car for the handout from a few weeks back but more stupid.</p>

			<p>Usually, when you hear about child support enforcement, and about some father thrown in jail for child support in arrears, it&rsquo;s white.  I had never heard of a black man who had numerous children by numerous women being thrown in jail for c/s, until now.</p>

			<p>When will this country have the courage and the will power to impose mandatory sterilization/birth control on people who should not be reproducing?  For this particular individual, it would have been better for him and society.  To reproduce is not a right but a privilege which at this point future generations will have to come to grips with.</p>

			<p>I disagree with mandatory sterilization for anyone&hellip;to reproduce is not a privilege, it&rsquo;s a right.  More of a mandate, really.  I&rsquo;d hate to see that slippery slope&hellip;the state would get to determine who&rsquo;s fit, and guess where that could go&hellip;?</p>
<p>Perhaps there should be penalties for fornication and adultery  &mdash;  jail time.  It would keep these breeders out of society.  And no welfare.  How many of these women are punching out kids just for that welfare check?</p>

			<p>I had the regretable experience of living in Flint MI,and the slum Detriot has become is middle-class in comparison,it is RARE to see a girl beyond nineteen without an illegitimate child-and regardless of the mothers race the un-planned children are almost always black,it is beyond me why we reward illresponsible reproduction in this country-if they knew they could&rsquo;nt get welfare they would spend the buck for a condom.</p>

			<p>I must have missed something what NBA or NFL team does he play for? It is stories like this that make me proud to be an American. He is making the white taxpayers atone for 400 years of slavery and discrimination. He is no Uncle Tom, more like Father Abraham. Obama needs to pardon him and set aside play days with his daughters when they turn 13.<br>
     Of the fourteen, I wonder how many had white mothers. If he played for the Pistons or Saints, I`d say about ten. if he never played for a pro team, I`d say about 8.<br>

			<p> Frazier is typical of so many black men: Impregnate as many women as possible, then go on your merry way, caring not a fig for the welfare of the children you&rsquo;ve fathered. Naturally, there are men of all races who are just as uncaring and irresponsible   &mdash;   but my considered opinion is that the percentage of blacks who are that way is much higher than any of the others.</p>
<p> My grandfather sired 14 children, too   &mdash;   but they were all born to my grandmother, and he supported and raised them!</p>

			<p>We once had a young 20-something black guy working part time in our mail room.  I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t want to work full time?  He told me that if he worked full time his check would be garnished by the welfare authorities in order to support various illegitimate kids. I don&rsquo;t know if what he said was true, but it made since considering his way of life.  Needless to say, he didn&rsquo;t last long, even at part time.  He just didn&rsquo;t seem to motivated, from a work standpoint.  But he did manage to impregnate one of the black secretaries, before he left.</p>

			<p>Blame the women. </p>
<p>Men have to work, go to war, and do just about everything else in society.</p>
<p>Sexuality is traditionally the only thing that women were responsible for.</p>
<p>Then came welfare&hellip;</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s keep in mind that the women involved in these stories aren&rsquo;t very bright. They chose lousy mates. It cracks me up when people feel sorry for them when they get abandoned by their men. Didn&rsquo;t they have a choice in who to make a baby with? Are we really supposed to feel sorry for them? They get no sympathy from me.</p>

			<p><i>Frazier, 42, portrays himself as the victim</i>.</p>
<p>He is just a victim of his &#8216;nature&rsquo; or genes.<br>
A good design for the feral world, but bad for civilisation.</p>
<p>And his fatherless children and our children who&rsquo;ll have to assoicate with them are the true victims, not to mention whoever will end up paying the bill to raise them (stepfathers or the state).<br>
There will be another 14 little broken hearted people released into society.<br>
Who will probably be full of anger and low self esteem, along with a negative view of who and where they come from.<br>
And judging from their mothers lack of vision and foresight, will be without the tools to overcome their burden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair to us who make efforts to raise our children properly..<br>
One of my neighbours here is a grandmother(doormat) whose two children are junkies (white if it matters), one of whom has had 4 kids and who are working on no.5, the son is a drug induced schizophonic and she prosititutes on the side, and has had numerous arrests for fraud and the like. And already I can see that their children who are always screaming, or just floating around with vacant looks in their eyes are broken people who will turn their rage on some decent naive person in the future.</p>
<p>Providing this Frazier&rsquo;s children learn to read, there will be another 14 copies of &#8216;Dreams of my father&rsquo; sold in the next couple of years. And they too will probably think for a short time at least, that they as fatherless blacks/ mulatto&rsquo;s can be President too. <br>
Once that bubble bursts, it&rsquo;ll be another reason for them to be angry.<br>
