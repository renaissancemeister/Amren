<h1>Furious Protest Stops Tancredo&rsquo;s UNC Speech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James DeConto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>UNC-CH police released pepper spray and threatened to use a Taser on student protesters Tuesday evening when a crowd disrupted a speech by former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo opposing in-state tuition benefits to unauthorized immigrants. </p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters converged on Bingham Hall, shouting profanities and accusations of racism while Tancredo and the student who introduced him tried to speak. Minutes into the speech, a protester pounded a window of the classroom until the glass shattered, prompting Tancredo to flee and campus police to shut down the event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inside the classroom, several student protesters screamed curses at Tancredo and Riley Matheson, president of the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of Youth for Western Civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the free speech crowd, right?&#8221; Tancredo joked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The protesters relented, and Tancredo began to speak, describing failed state and federal legislation aimed at providing in-state tuition benefits for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Two women stretched out another banner, first along one of the aisles and then right in front of Tancredo. Tancredo grabbed the middle of the banner and tried to pull it away from one of the girls. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t want to hear what I have to say because you don&rsquo;t agree with me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The sound of breaking glass from behind a window shade interrupted the tug-of-war.</p>
<p>Tancredo was escorted from the room by campus police.</p>
<p>About 200 protesters reconvened outside the building. &#8220;We shut him down; no racists in our town,&#8221; they shouted. &#8220;Yes, racists, we will fight, we know where you sleep at night!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re very sorry that former Congressman Tancredo wasn&rsquo;t able to speak,&#8221; Chancellor Holden Thorp said in a prepared statement. &#8220;We pride ourselves on being a place where all points of view can be expressed and heard, so I&rsquo;m disappointed that didn&rsquo;t happen tonight. I think our Public Safety officers appropriately handled a difficult situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police spokesman Randy Young said he couldn&rsquo;t recall student protesters shutting down another campus event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fascists are fascists,&#8221; Tancredo said. &#8220;Their actions were probably the best speech I could ever give. They are what&rsquo;s wrong with America today. &hellip; When all you can do is yell epithets, that means you are intellectually bankrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p>UNC graduate student Tyler Oakley, who had organized the protest, said he regretted the broken window but not silencing Tancredo. &#8220;He was not able to practice his hate speech,&#8221; said Oakley. &#8220;You have to respect the right of people to assemble and collectively speak.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Protesters Stop Speech</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Laura Hoxworth, Daily Traheel (University of North Carolina), April 15, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Police used pepper spray to disperse crowds of protestors in Bingham Hall on Tuesday outside the room where former congressman Tom Tancredo was scheduled to speak on immigration but was forced to leave. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo, a former Republican U.S. Representative from Colorado, a former presidential candidate and an outspoken critic of immigration, was brought to UNC by the new student organization Youth for Western Civilization.</p>
<p>About 150 people gathered in Bingham Hall auditorium, and many more protestors gathered in the hallway after police declared the room full and blocked the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m here because I represent UNC-Chapel Hill and I don&rsquo;t support racism or fascism in the institution in which I am an educator,&#8221; graduate student Jason Bowers said.</p>
<p>Riley Matheson, president of Youth for Western Civilization, introduced Tancredo amid hissing, booing and shouts of &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After Tancredo entered the room, protesters kept him from speaking by shouting insults and holding a sign declaring &#8220;no dialogue with hate&#8221; in front of his face. Tancredo waited calmly while protestors held the sign and chanted.</p>
<p>Two protestors holding the sign in front of Tancredo were escorted into the hallway by police, where the Taser and pepper spray were used.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After protestors exited the hallway, Tancredo spoke for about two minutes before a protestor outside the building banged on a window, shattering the glass. </p>
<p>Tancredo was escorted out of the room by police after he deemed the situation too volatile, Young said.</p>
<p>Protestors then exited the building and gathered outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free speech was destroyed today at Chapel Hill by the breaking of glass and violence,&#8221; said William Gheen, a former UNC student and president of Americans for Legal Immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sophomore Adrian Lopez, a member of the Carolina Hispanic Organization, attended the speech to protest Tancredo&rsquo;s view, but said he did not agree with how the protest was handled. </p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very embarrassed about how the student body went about doing this,&#8221; Lopez said. &#8220;It got completely out of control.&#8221; </p>
<p>No arrests were made, but there will be an investigation into criminal activity by protestors and the use of force by officers.</p>

			<p>  It amazes me how diversity liberals, who pretend to believe in the first Amendment, are the first to stifle any opinion that contradicts their firmly held multicultural dogmas. They are also the most likely to hurl insults, ignore laws and disrupt legal free speech.</p>

			<p>It happened, but just how many American people will know this contradictory event took place? They cant see the hypocrisy of the illegals or of their benefactors (lefties) unless they actually know what transpired.</p>
<p>Please everyone, spread the story around as much as possible.</p>

			<p>The congressman didn&rsquo;t face a protest, he faced a riot. The people who organized the &#8220;protests&#8221; need to be found and arrested for instigation. That kind of behavior is disgraceful. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to peacefully demonstrate, quite another to start destroying others&rsquo; property.</p>
<p>Tancredo&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  they let their actions speak for themselves.</p>

Any student or faculty member who interferes with free speech in this fashion should be expelled from the school. Period. </p>
<p>And anything short of punishment by the university is the same as condoning the act.</p>

			<p>If Chancellor is so upset that Tancredo was shouted off the stage, then he should find a way to break the tenure and fire the professors that were behind this protest.</p>

			<p>Student protestors, all idealistic and naive, don&rsquo;t know who they are and don&rsquo;t know anything about the world away from the way they were raised. (But, they&rsquo;re on their own now. Surely what they have learned away from mama and daddy is important and going to make a difference.)</p>
<p>I never went to the student center at the University of Georgia. I didn&rsquo;t want to hear those idiots picking fights and complaining about those on their platform that felt they had something important to say.</p>
<p>My father has long said that I&rsquo;m living in the wrong generation. I&rsquo;m a lot like him-conservative and knowledgeable of my roots and how it&rsquo;s affected my place in this world today. Life&rsquo;s hard enough. I don&rsquo;t need to invent things to cause more problems. </p>

			<p>Patriots should give up speaking on university campuses. They have been brainwashed by radical professors who don&rsquo;t think ahead. Those who approve illegal immigration are bleeding hearts, looking for votes or getting payoffs. They&rsquo;re not thinking about the welfare of this country or its citizens. When illegals have the magic wand waved, then each brings in twenty-five close family members. Pretty soon we have another Mexico. Is that what they really want for their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;ll continue to fight for their eviction.</p>

			<p>We seem to be revisiting the mob lunacy of the Sixties, when student radicals got the notion that their indefensibly stupid &#8220;ideas&#8221; not only were correct, but that any contrary thoughts should be illegal and their proponents prevented from expressing them.</p>
<p>Strange.  What goes around comes around. </p>

			<p>How is it racist to be against immigration? Unless some races more than others are immigrating? Unless immigration itself has a racial component to it? Isn&rsquo;t this just an admission that immigration as it stands is itself an example of racism? I suppose where whites move in with anyone else it&rsquo;s called colonialism. Of course &#8216;colonialism&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really happen much anymore. For the last 100 years or so it&rsquo;s always worked the other way around, and the other way of around only. In the neighborhood or on a global scale. The reaction to this is just another example of whites = bad, non-whites = good, ideology.  </p>

			<p>I wonder what the university&rsquo;s reaction would be if members of the Youth for Western Civilization engaged in this sort of behavior during a lecture by a left-wing black or latino speaker.  Expulsion for rioters.  Swift-condemnation of incident.  An public apology to the black and latino student communities.  Will we see any of that after this incident?  If Tancredo gets a private apology, it will be a lot. </p>

			<p>There is simply NO-ONE more undemocratic, more intolerant, more intransigent and against freedom of speech than a &#8216;liberal&rsquo;! </p>
<p>There is no-one more immature than a student.</p>
<p>They believe shouting &amp; chanting equate to reasoned arguement.  But if you fight back YOUR the fascist!!?</p>
<p>&#8216;The price of freedom is eternal vigilance&rsquo; and quite frankly we went to sleep and let these lunatics and their &#8216;holier than thou&rsquo; policies creep up on us.<br/>

			<p>Did anyone see any mention whatsoever of this event on the various nightly news channels?  If so-called &#8220;white power&#8221; groups had violently interrupted a representative of the NAACP who was addressing the student body, it would have led on every news outlet, domestic as well as foreign.</p>
<p>It a sad example of how one-sided our society has become in its violent rejection of opinion that is deemed &#8220;racist&#8221; or counter to accepted liberal tenets.  This is scary, to say the least.</p>
<p>Any public forum that challenges Obama-ism will elicit censure or a knock on the door by the thought police.</p>
<p>Tancredo is no Ku-Klux-Klanner: he is a voice of reason that the left does not want to hear or let be heard.  Our campuses are no longer safe havens for open and spirited debate.</p>
<p>Poor Arthur Jensen faced the same hatred way back in the late 60s.  We have learned nothing since then.</p>

			<p>I agree with June.  Conservatives should forget about speaking at college campuses unless its Bob Jones, Hillsdale, or Liberty Universities.  What&rsquo;s the point.  They are completely beyond the pale.  Sun Tzu wrote that you should choose your battles carefully and only fight the battles you can win.  Everything else is a waste of time and energy.  If you must speak at a college, meet off campus and speak at a private hall.  I know from personal experience that college police are totally useless.   </p>

			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just wishful thinking, but it seems the tables are turning on the liberal, leftist &#8220;student protesters.&#8221; In the 1960&rsquo;s, they succeeded in claiming the moral high ground, supposedly being all about freedom, &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; peace, love, antiwar, etc.  Nowadays, they seem increasingly shrill and desperate, seeing public attitude slowly turning against, rather than towards, their point of view, and so needing to violently silence people like this legitimately elected former Congressman. Plus, their claims of being all about &#8220;freedom&#8221; are now utterly exposed as a bald-faced lie, since they are now reduced to violently stifling free speech, one of our most treasured freedoms.</p>

			<p>just goes to show you that the conservatives continue to make stupid decision&hellip;.why would mr tancredo go into a highly charged lberal venue like unc-ch to make a conservative speech.. wasn&rsquo;t there a hotel banquet room available where this speech could have been made to the public rather than a bunch of brainwashed college lefties&hellip;should have known what he was going to get..when will our side realize that they should never go on left wing tv shows or into left wing venues and speak..the liberals are smarter, they never go on right wing shows, they are smart enough to refuse..</p>

Exactly!  They need to be ARRESTED and PROSECUTED! <br/>
There has to be a penalty attached to outrageous behavior such as this. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just an amusing escapade for them to chuckle and boast about with their friends.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a good idea; a major contributing factor to this racism/diversity mess is how whites are dissuaded from taking the actions that are needed because they are convinced that they would be futile. Oh, don&rsquo;t say anything, you&rsquo;ll just lose your job and nothing will change. Oh, don&rsquo;t bother lecturing, because they&rsquo;re so far gone nothing will come of it. Oh, don&rsquo;t bother arguing with them, it&rsquo;s just a waste of time.</p>
<p>Some will probably think, if not post, that well yeah, it is futile   &mdash;   and to some degree they&rsquo;re certainly right   &mdash;   but, though I feel I cannot make many confident judgements, one I can make is that it would not be a good thing if nobody were &#8220;stupid&#8221; enough to fail to realize how futile things are and for that behave accordingly &#8220;foolish&#8221;   &mdash;   if everyone were &#8220;smart&#8221;, and there were no naive rookie cops giving frank opinions to college journalists, and there were no naive race realists arguing with Liberals, and there were no naive former congressmen going about attempting to speak about issues, etc.</p>
<p>What would we have, if everyone &#8220;smartly&#8221; shut themselves up? Just dead uneventfulness, that would be certainly hopeless?</p>

			<p>I see &#8220;both&#8221; sides as wanting to stifle free speech.  Opposed to Bush&rsquo;s policies?  You&rsquo;re with the terrorists!  Opposed to Obama?  You&rsquo;re a racist  &mdash;  and a terrorist!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against the Iraq war because it&rsquo;s based on lies.  Now if it were a just war, I&rsquo;d be for it.  But other than that you could classify me as a conservative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy for a president and his flunkies to say that anyone opposed to the current administration is someone on the opposite end of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about left vs. right, it&rsquo;s about right vs. wrong.</p>

			<p>History repeats itself. Is this, and countless other conservative speakers and events across the country who are silenced, and sometimes violently silenced, not unlike post 1917 Russia where the bolshevics silenced all but thier own propaganda. The leftist always know whats best for all citizens and cant stand it when they think for themselves. And history shows just how successful communist dogma is&hellip;.  However yesterday a glimmer of hope for America shown thru in the tea parties. Are we finally begining to wake up? I hope yesterday was but the first shot, and we must be prepared to keep fighting and take hits along the way. I am proud of the brave souls yesterday who stood out there and let their voices be heard. Kingfish  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time we started playing the propaganda game, and throwing their intolerance right back at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a disgusting display of intolerance, Hispanic terrorists started a riot to prevent former congressman Tom Tancredo from exercising his right to speak freely and without the threat of attack. Campus police had to escort Rep. Tancredo from the grasp of criminals, possibly fronted by the Carolina Hispanic Organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>See? It&rsquo;s easy! Took me all of five minutes. Most of the people posting here are literate enough to do it&hellip;so let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>To Lefties and other haters of Western Civilization, you are either with them or you are against them. There is no &#8220;voice of reason&#8221; or &#8220;moderate Conservatism&#8221; from their point of view. If you lift one finger or eyebrow when they try to push full amnesty and unlimited immigration, you are The Enemy in their book. If you question affirmative action or illegal immigration, the Lefties identify you as an Evil Racist. </p>
<p>Learn that and accept it, because the take home lesson is that there is no point in watering down your message. Might as well say what you have to say clear and true. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also high time for Christian Conservatives to stop apologizing for other people&rsquo;s history and kow towing to the Left by calling obvious anti-Western Lefty agitators &#8220;brown shirts&#8221; or &#8220;fascists.&#8221; That is idiotic, because they are no such thing. They are Communists if you want to use any label. </p>

     Sunder is dead on correct about this.  Our enemies work unceasingly to create this mind set among out people.  </p>
<p>     I am reminded of a quote of George Washington during the Revolution when he met with his staff to review an increasingly grim military situation.  He said to his officers, &#8220;We cannot guarantee victory, but we can deserve it.&#8221;<br/>
    <br/>
      What he meant by this was that the future is in God&rsquo;s hands, but the effort we put towards that future is in ours.  Imagine the effect we could all have if we all worked together unceasingly to turn our situation as a people around.  Do you really think there is any possiblity we would lose?

     So, the choice is yours.  What are you going to do today to turn this situation around?  Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.  Take it now! </p>

			<p>Everyone says not to plan events like this anymore, but I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to continue. So the liberals will scream like children and break windows&hellip; GOOD. Let people see the Tolerance Gestapo in action, even if it&rsquo;s just your community by watching the local news. Sometimes movements take off locally, you know&hellip;</p>

			<p>This type of garbage is coming from academia and it will be effectively solved when semester costs at even the lowliest state university is $1000 per credit-hour.  Then Daddy and Mommy will have to tell little Ashley and Cody that upon graduation from high school they&rsquo;ll have to either enter a technical school or find a job (or join the Navy!).</p>
<p>As a commenter at Lawrence Auster&rsquo;s &#8220;View From the Right&#8221; said, I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about a complete and total economic meltdown.</p>

			<p>Why do some people here insist on making a distinction between illegal and LEGAL immigration? In terms of the demographic-and labor market consequences-for Native Born White Americans, post-1965 LEGAL immigration is just as bad as illegal immigration.</p>
<p>In two years the census bureau will annouce that that the minority status of Native Born White Americans is inevitable. Upon this announcement, the MSM will turn up the anti-white propaganda with a vengeance. Post-1965 non-whites will in OUR faces  at work and at universities. The Republican party will publicly express a full-blown hostility to Native Born White Males. Al of this because of post-1965 LEGAL immigation.</p>
<p>It would be much better if Tancredo spoke out against LEGAL immigration during his public appearances on Universtiy campuses. The Lefties would go beserk&hellip;and this would be a good thing for it bring more MSM atetnion to the issue&hellip;thereby alerting many more of the currently politically inert Native Born Whie Americans to revolt against against post-1965 immigration policy and start contemplating steps such as mass deportations to reverse the racial transformatio of America.</p>
<p>Some of you here and in the other thread want Tancredo to stop appearing on college campuses. This would be a very foolish thing to do. WE NEED THE FREE PUBLICITY!!!! Tancredo should be encouraged to start taking on the LEGAL immigration issue. HE can start with the H-1B visa and L-1 B visa programs and start to talk publicly about the fact that post-1965 LEGAL imigrants and their &#8220;american&#8221; born chldren account for 100 percent of curent US population growth. And if the campus Lefties scream racism, Tancredo can aways respond  back..&#8221;Well if its population growth you want are you lefties in favor of White Americans increasing their fertility level significantly&#8221; It would be a wonderfull opportunity to expose the nasty agenda of the left-liberal types publicly in full view of millions of Native Born White Americans on MSM coverage. Some of you really haven&rsquo;t a clue as to how to fight back in a creative and effective way. WE are being presented with an opportunity.</p>

			<p>In the USA, everyone (theoretically) has the guaranteed constitutional right to speak his opinion.  And others have the same right to hear it. </p>
<p>Was this not a violation of Tancredo&rsquo;s civil rights? Do whites still have civil rights?</p>
<p>If this had happenedd to any black speaker   &mdash;   say Sharpton   &mdash;   the FBI and Justice Department would be crawling all over that place.  The administration would be replaced, heads would roll.  And there would be arrests made and prosecutions to the fullest   &mdash;   even if it took the next 40 years to track them down and prosecute them in their old age! And then prosecute them AGAIN if they weren&rsquo;t convicted the first time!</p>

			<p>Funny, if Tancredo is such an evil racist that so many people would riot over it, you&rsquo;d think his views would be easy to smash down in the realm of debate.</p>
<p>Apparently hate speech is speaking out about immigration and foreign colonization, and not screaming slurs and epithets at a man trying to give a speech in a civilized manner.</p>

<p>Other than the obvious reason of these young &#8220;anarchists&#8221; being egged on by a professor, I banged my head against the wall trying to assign motive to their actions, especially why the immigration issue gets them so worked up.

<p>I&rsquo;m all for putting a moratorium on legal immigration.</p>
<p>And as far as immigration&hellip;we should be able to decide our own demographics.  We should have the right to accept or reject an applicant for any reason.</p>
<p>Kick out the illegals, limit immigration, stop outsourcing jobs, and I think it&rsquo;ll help.</p>

			<p> A moratorium on immigration is needed now. This will never happen with citizen of the world-Obama. The only thing American about Obama is his wife.  Interesting how all those who sign petitions to Congress for immigration reform(amnesty) are financially benefitting religious types. Ethnics are united in destroying white America.  They have perpetrated the greatest HATE CRIME in history.  Idiots and idols have replaced free speech and equality with hate crimes.  Now, only ethnic groups represent America.  Whites have been legislated from their rigthts/heritage.  V</p>

<p>Why only a moratorium on non-white LEGAL immigration? A<br/>
moratorium means a temporary reduction on LEGAL immigration. Even with a moratorium on non-white LEGAL immigration, the demographic force of 45 years of post-1965 LEGAL immigration will result in minority racial status for Native Born White Americans. Why do some people always coddle post-1965 LEGAL immigrants?</p>
<p>Even when asian LEGAL asian immigration was on a smaller scale than it is today, it had damaging labor market consequences for Native Born White American Men who worked as engineers. And this limited asian LEGAL immigration enabled LEGAL immigant asians and their &#8220;american&#8221; born offspring to establish a political beach-head which enabled them to conquer and own the US congress(India Policy Group in the US congres)</p>
<p>Let me tell you how bad the situation is. As I mentioned, even if there was a moratorium, Native Born White Americans would still become a racial minority&hellip;unless&hellip;.Native Born White fertility increased significantly. Howewver, as much as I would be happy to see a significant increase in Native Born White fertility, a significant increase in Native Born White fertility combined with internal post-1965 demographic forces would result in a US population that will hit the billion mark in in a few decades. It would result in an enviromental and ecoogical catastrophe. And the amenties-open space,beautifull forests, national and state parks will all be lost. It will be a hellish dsytopia.<br/>
At a bare minimum, ALL NON_WHITE POST-1965 immigration must be shut down completely-0-forever. After that there will have to be deportations. The situation is far worse than anybody realizes.</p>
<p>A moratorium means maintaing LEGAL immigration at one hundred thousand a year. It would be insane to import one hundred non-whites-who harbor hostile intentions towards the majority Native Born White population. What would you like to do, import one hundred thousand asian engineers,computer programmers and medical doctors a year? This experiment has already been performed and it has been a disaster for Native Born White Americans. Shut the whole thng down to 0 forever.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;In a disgusting display of intolerance, Hispanic terrorists started a riot to prevent former congressman Tom Tancredo from exercising his right to speak freely and without the threat of attack. Campus police had to escort Rep. Tancredo from the grasp of criminals, possibly fronted by the Carolina Hispanic Organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You forgot to call Tancredo, &#8220;&#8216;popular&rsquo; former congressman Tom Tancredo&#8221;, or &#8220;&#8216;Principled former congressman Tom Tancredo&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why not split the difference and call him &#8220;&#8216;Controversial&rsquo; hate monger Tom Tancredo&#8221;? Well, they do say it&rsquo;s more effective if you imply someone&rsquo;s a jerk rather than just calling them a &#8216;jerk&rsquo;. </p>

			<p><i>I see &ldquo;both&rdquo; sides as wanting to stifle free speech. Opposed to Bush&rsquo;s policies? You&rsquo;re with the terrorists! Opposed to Obama? You&rsquo;re a racist &mdash; and a terrorist!<br/>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>
Yes, enemies of free speech exist on both left and right. But right now, the left has upper hand.</p>
<p>In a supposedly democratic, open society where everyone is constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and opinion, as well as the freedom to assemble to discuss those opinions, it is a difficult  dilemma for the totalitarians who would like to suppress such freedoms.  Freedom of speech is a terrible thorn in the side of those who would like to force us to think and live the way they decide we should.</p>
<p>However, they have found a sly way to get around the dilemma.  By inventing certain words of opprobrium they have created, by implication,  an outcast group of moral degenerates, social lepers,  who are assumed not to have the priviledges and freedoms enjoyed by decent &#8220;normal&#8221; persons.  Thus, shouts of &#8220;racist&#8221;,  &#8220;fascist&#8221;,  &#8220;hater&#8221;, &#8220;bigot&#8221;,  &#8220;extremist&#8221;,  &#8220;anti-Semite&#8221;, &#8220;xenophobe&#8221;,  etc.  are used to silence, marginalize, and isolate whomever the Left would like to imply are beyond the limits of decent society, and so are not entitled to the civil liberties otherwise guaranteed them by law.  </p>
<p>Of course, the Constitution does not define any class who is outside the pale of its protection (indeed, not anyone at all!), but that little technical fine point is a small inconvenience cavalierly overlooked by those who believe the end justifies the means.  And very few of the gullible public stop to question it or even notice it.  Not even supposedly intelligent university administrators! </p>

			<p>I think that Mr Tancredo should increase his appearances on college campuses.  There will be no mass response unless the shrinking White population is forced into it.  The MSM won&rsquo;t report this stuff, but every time a White with an ounce of sense wonders why the local riot wasn&rsquo;t mentioned on the TV news, the MSM loses credibility, and sites like this gain.  Let the White &#8220;conservatives&#8221; have their tea parties assaulted by &#8220;youths&#8221;.  Let them go home and think about what it meant to have Mexicans and their leftist supporters attack you in your own country.  Let the police choose sides, Americans or rioters.  Let the Americans note what side the cops and everyone else chooses.  <br/>
     Think about it: The Department of Homeland Security has warned against right wing terror.  It&rsquo;s not bombing or bio-warfare they&rsquo;re afraid of, they fear that too many Whites will connect too many dots.  The Reds and their Brown stooges are connecting the dots for us.  We should count our blessings.</p>
