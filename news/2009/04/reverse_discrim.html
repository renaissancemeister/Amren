<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30462129/">Reverse Discrimination Suits Flourish</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The issue of reverse discrimination first reached the nation&rsquo;s highest court in the 1970s, when a student with good grades named Allan Bakke accused a University of California medical school of twice denying him admission because he was white.</p>
<p>Strict racial quotas were unconstitutional, the court said  &mdash;  affirmative action was not. But that ruling far from decided what many considered the big-picture issue: Does protecting minorities discriminate against the majority?</p>
<p>More than 30 years, and scores of lawsuits later, the question remains unanswered. Meanwhile, more Americans came to believe that affirmation action is no longer necessary, and that instead of leveling the playfield for minorities, it unfairly punishes whites.</p>
<p>Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case filed by white firefighters who claimed they were denied promotion because of the color of their skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The laws that Congress wrote are clear  &mdash;  everyone is protected from racial discrimination,&#8221; said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank that advocates eliminating race and ethnic considerations. &#8220;Not just blacks, but whites. Not just Latinos, but whites.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>States have faced legal battles</b></p>
<p>Those who favor affirmative action say race divisions still exist in this country, 40 years after the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several states have recently faced legal battles waged by whites claiming they were unfairly treated in favor of protecting and promoting blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Earlier this month in South Carolina, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued a historically black college on behalf of three white faculty members who complained they were forced from or denied jobs because of their race.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, federal officials said they had reached a settlement agreement, with Benedict College paying $55,000 to each instructor, including an art teacher who said she was denied promotion in favor of a black professor. The institution denied the accusations.</p>
<p>Last week, a white woman in Texas filed a federal lawsuit against an assisted-living center, contending she was discriminated against and harassed by Hispanics because she didn&rsquo;t speak Spanish.</p>
<p>And in Florida, two transportation companies sued Broward County over efforts to steer public contracts to minority-owned businesses. The firms, which had provided car service for the handicapped and the elderly, claimed they were paid lower fees than other contractors because they didn&rsquo;t comply with affirmative action requirements.</p>
<p><b>Outlawing bias toward race</b></p>
<p>Affirmative action  &mdash;  policies designed to promote and protect groups previously and currently denied equal standing  &mdash;  originated with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Broadly speaking, it outlaws bias toward race, creed, color or national origin in school admissions, voting rights, employment and government contracting.</p>
<p>Sometimes those policies have set aside jobs, college admissions and government contracts for minority applicants, students and firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quotas do not end discrimination. They are discrimination,&#8221; Clegg said. &#8220;The law makes clear that race, ethnicity and sex are not to be part of who gets a government contract or who gets into a university or where someone goes to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Stop discriminating on the basis of race&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Twenty years later, a more conservative court declared that public school systems cannot try to achieve or maintain integration based on explicit race rules. In a 5-to-4 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote &#8220;the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&#8221; At issue in the case were programs in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., that tried to maintain racial diversity by limiting transfers and admissions.</p>

			<p>Why does discrimination change to reverse discrimination just because the victims are now white? I can find no dictionary that defines discrimination as a behavior exclusive to white people. Lets call this what it is, discrimination.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad to hear there are many more suits for anti-white racism.</p>
<p>But one thing this article brings to mind with Bakke is that there are many med students rebuffed in their desire to go to med school, yet the government is always complaining we don&rsquo;t have enough doctors in this country, so they import second-rate ones from the third world.  I wonder if, in all their brilliance, they ever considered the possibility of opening up MANY more medical schools to alleviate the problem.  Not only will the number of doctors increase, but nobody will have to be turned away.</p>
<p>Are they really that stupid or is there something I&rsquo;m not aware of?</p>

			<p>The courts are the primary battleground for racial policy. Whites should sue at every given opportunity. If you are a crime victim of a black criminal sue the local NAACP, diversity training companies, and anybody else who directly or indirectly contributed to the circumstances that caused your victimization.</p>

			<p> There won&rsquo;t be an end to race-based discrimination, known by the euphemism &#8220;affirmative action,&#8221; until the Supreme Court quits equivocating, and splitting hairs, and trying to decide &#8220;what IS is,&#8221; and makes a flat-out ruling that racially-based hiring, and racially-based &#8220;balancing&#8221; of schools and other public institutions, will not be tolerated any longer, period, end of discussion.</p>
<p> And another thing: What&rsquo;s all this we hear about establishing a &#8220;level playing field&#8221;? In real life, there are no level playing fields   &mdash;   someone ALWAYS has an advantage of some type.</p>
<p> Third and last, when the affirmative-action pushers claim that &#8220;Whites are still advantaged in many ways,&#8221; why don&rsquo;t they ever explain exactly what they mean? Advantaged how? And why don&rsquo;t reporters ask them that question, instead of letting them off the hook?</p>

			<p>I was involved in a debate in class many years ago on the Bakke case.  Before I did my research, I wondered what the big deal was.  I thought that Bakke and the black students had pretty much the same test scores to get into medical school, and that affirmative action was sort of like the tie-braker.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the exact scores, but I was shocked to find out that it was not a case where Bakke and the black students that were selected ahead of him had about the same scores.  It turned out that Bakke had something like scores in the 85th percentile, and the black students had on average scores like in the 40th percentile!  That was really eye opening!  I, of course, took the side of Bakke as a result!</p>

			<p>Diversity means accepting those that are radically different from us, even if their ways appear strange, racist and horrible to us. This &#8220;us&#8221; includes minorities, who by the law&rsquo;s original intent are required to tolerate whites. That works well with a sense of fair play (level playing field) but poorly with entitlement, revenge and other psychologies used by the left.</p>

			<p>Is their a federal guideline for the determination of what race is and how to classify people by race?   Once that lawsuit hits the court system the left will be scrambling like crazy.  So instead of using their language as half the posts above did by using some meaningless word &#8220;racist&#8221; instead we ask the left in the courts and in civil debate how they define &#8220;Race&#8221; legally.</p>

<p>Black Power is absolutely right.  No matter how many anti affirmative action laws are passed such as Prop 209 and other states &#8220;Civil Rights Initiatives&#8221;, the no whites need apply laws are here and will stay forever.</p>
<p>Observe California.  10 years after Prop 209 was upheld by the anti white ADL dominated marxist 9th circuit federal court, there are fewer Whites working in state and local government than back in 1996 when Prop 209 was finally voted in.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be any changes.  Our government began the extermination process back in 1955 when Eisenhower and Earl Warren sent feral black youth into the schools to beat and abuse White children and teachers.</p>
<p>It continued with Pres Kennedy coining the words affirmative action and ordering federal agencies and federally funded state and local agencies to give a little edge in the interview to QUALIFIED, and only qualified blacks.</p>
<p>Then Lyndon Johnson flooded every government agency with his war on poverty anti white commie groups run by  the grandchildren of FDR&rsquo;s New Deal agencie&rsquo;s communists.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan, the great White hope of the White working class and his EEOC chairman, Clarence Thomas got rid of the PACE exam, a simple exam required of people who applied for federal jobs that required a Bachelor&rsquo;s, Master&rsquo;s or PHD.  The PACE exam required 10th grade math and 12th grade verbal ability to pass.</p>
<p>You see, blacks with Master&rsquo;s degrees kept failing that PACE exam, so the exam was dumped.  So we have high ranking black and hispanic federal employees with Master&rsquo;s degrees who could not pass the standard high school exit exam.</p>
<p>Every President and congress, every corporation, every idiot intellectual, TV talking head and most of all, every college and university instructor wants us exterminated.</p>
<p>Black Power is absolutely right.  Unfortunately for his or her children, affirmative action aristocratic status has passed from Blacks to asians, indians and hispanics.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Whites are still advantaged in many ways,&rdquo; why don&rsquo;t they ever explain exactly what they mean? Advantaged how? &#8220;</p>
<p>White advantage means that our young men stay out of prison no matter how poor they are.  White advantage means that our single mothers don&rsquo;t beat and abuse and kill their children.  White advantage means that we do not turn to crime when savings and unemployment run out and the welfare department refuses to give us food stamps because we are White.</p>
<p>White advantage means that our high school seniors still socre high on SATs and advanced placement courses, still graduate with A+ GPAs even though such is effort as Whites are turned down by every college because they are White.</p>
<p>White advantage means that even though White computer programers have to work at Chain Bookstores at minimum wage instead of their chosen field, they still have that diploma in programming and computer systems analysis and Oracle certificates.</p>
<p>White advantage is scoring in the 99th percentile of your SAT&rsquo;s and getting turned down by every college you apply to.  You still have the &#8220;self esteem&#8221; of remembering your high score when you can&rsquo;t find any sort of job because you are White.</p>

			<p>I recall a conversation at the time of the Bakke case.</p>
<p>The conversation &#8216;winner&rsquo; said:</p>
<p>In the long run, it will even itself out. <br>
If school A takes low-scorers on the basis of their skin color and school B takes the high scorers, mainly whites and Asians, which school will end up with the better reputation? </p>
<p>Tough on Bakke and those like him in the short term, however.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never believe that. I actually feel sorry for the Hispanics. At least whites have a chance of learning an in-demand trade or going into business for themselves. Blacks have a stranglehold on affirmative action jobs, eeoc offices, employment offices in industry, and especially city, state, and federal government jobs. Sure, they&rsquo;re hired before whites but that&rsquo;s all they can say.  </p>

<p>Whites can learn every on demand trade in existence, but the affirmative action gestapo monitors every employer and imposes draconian fines on those who hire Whites.</p>
<p>A skilled trade is good only if one can practice it.</p>

<p>You must not be from California. Here hispanics have affirmative action jobs by the hundreds of thousands. In fact, those amnestied by the great(sarcasm on my part) Ronald Reagan in 1986 have many of those cushy well paid government jobs and were selected over others, even long time taxpayers. Also, hispanics have programs set up by every college, high school and even private business where they can learn an &#8220;in-demand trade&#8221;, all at the taxpayers expense. Free in other words.</p>

What I find intersting is that after all the &#8216;progess&rsquo; they have made in the last 50 years (and after all that we have lost, I think the last R.R. generation was the WW2 generation who my family has been putting in the ground over the last couple of years), they still talk about the U.S. specifically like it&rsquo;s Nazi Germany. <br>

<p>The above comments only confirm what more and more whites are learning every day. That Africans (who still practice slavery)are the most racist people on the planet. </p>
<p>Below is a link to an Irish Times article on the Red Legs of Barbados, descendants of the white indentured servants brought from the British Isles in the 17th century before Africans were brought there. These people are still poor today and live on the eastern side of Barbados, away from the tourists, where they have the added misfortune to be blamed by blacks for the slavery they themselves suffered. This poor group, which is gradually being absorbed, deserve a leg-up but of course our liberal politically-correct elite will ignore them. The Irish Times focuses on their Irishness but their surnames and historical research on a recent BBC2 Scotland documentary show that a large amount, maybe the majority, were Scots. So the truth probably is that they are descendants of exiled Scots Jacobites and Covenanters, Irish rebels and some English too.</p>
