			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tracy Wilkinson, Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Sunday vouched for Mexico&rsquo;s actions. Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of the agency, said Mexico had reported the swine flu cases &#8220;in a timely manner. They were having influenza season when the cases started .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we don&rsquo;t typically ask countries to report such cases. When they noticed increases in pneumonia and serious pneumonia, they initiated investigations, began testing and sent samples out to other labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have done a really good job in doing what a country should do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But other experts say Mexico&rsquo;s overwhelmed health system is underfunded and bogged down by useless regulations and layers of bureaucracy that will always impede a swift response to emergencies.</p>
<p>Oswaldo Medina, president of the Mexican Epidemiological Assn., said the system slows down identification of diseases, prevents fast response and hinders communication across hospitals, cities and states in the event of an epidemic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government has released scant information on who has died and on the exact path the outbreak has taken.</p>
<p>Most of those who died were of &#8220;productive age,&#8221; that is, between 20 and 50, Cordova said, a group that usually doesn&rsquo;t get flu shots and doesn&rsquo;t think it can get sick.</p>
<p>The medical community noticed a jump in flu cases, some lethal, in mid-March, when the flu season normally would be winding down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico does not have laboratories that can perform the sophisticated testing to identify unknown strains, as in this case. Calderon said he expected Mexico to have newer labs that are up to the task operating within 72 hours.</p>
<p>Sunday was another day when Mexico City residents stayed home in an effort to protect themselves. Soccer teams played to empty stadiums; priests prayed to empty pews (sermons were broadcast via radio).</p>
<p>Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard had said earlier that five more people had died in the capital overnight.</p>
<p>Six million face masks have been distributed, Calderon said. The body overseeing national elections scheduled for July told parties to suspend rallies and public meetings.</p>
<p>Still, there was widespread concern that the outbreak might be even worse than has been described. Mexicans, and especially residents of the capital, are generally mistrustful of the government. There is a long history here of less-than-truthful official pronouncements, mysterious plane crashes, assassinations and massacres, which gives rise to conspiracy theories and profound doubt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One newspaper editorial suggested that the handling of this crisis by the Calderon government could become its Hurricane Katrina, referring to the Bush administration&rsquo;s badly botched disaster relief effort after the destruction of New Orleans.</p>
<p>&#8220;New or not, the disease was manifesting itself more than a week ago .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;. enough for authorities to pay attention and come up with a plan of action,&#8221; the leftist daily La Jornada said in its principal editorial. &#8220;Instead, the government discourse has been characterized by imprecisions and fooleries that, like it or not, created confusion, uncertainty and anxiety in the public.&#8221;<br>

			<p>For the past 10 years, posters at this site have been warning that Third World immigrants bring dangerous diseases and pests to the USA.  Of course liberals called us kooks, extremists, and racists.  However, a look at facts tells otherwise   &mdash;   drug-resistant TB, drug-resistant AIDS, West Nile virus, bed bugs, and now Swine flu.  I hate to say we told you so, but we did!</p>
<p>However, liberals would rather be infested with bed bugs or have one of their children die of West Nile virus or Swine Flu than halt Third World immigration.  In their twisted minds, being accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; (because of wanting to protect the health of American Citizens) is much, much worse than dying of Swine flu.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mexico does not have laboratories that can perform the sophisticated testing to identify unknown strains, as in this case. Calderon said he expected Mexico to have newer labs that are up to the task operating within 72 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>So where and how are these &#8220;newer labs&#8221; going to pop-up in the next 3 days? Let me guess! Uncle Sam is going to dip into the white, middle-class, America taxpayer&rsquo;s pocket again for a country that has been around long enough for, one would think, to get its act together and so I&rsquo;m told, has a vast reserve of oil. How much further will we be stretched before we snap? This is going to cost us (U.S.) millions more.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this disease will not be as selective as AIDS.  But perhaps a few Whites will cancel their gardener or maid service for a few months.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did Mexican authorities move too slowly to attempt to contain the swine flu outbreak, contributing to a death toll believed to be more than 100 and still rising?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they did, but Napolitano is worse right here, because she is treating the matter as no big deal.</p>
<p>This could develop into a pandemic right here in the US.  If it comes about the markets will crash again and the entire continent of North America will be near cololapse.</p>
<p>This could be a VERY serious outbreak.  Certainly EVERY precaution should be taken, but I think the government is afraid to close the border, because it will cost them money.  So once again greed is the determining factor on decisions made by Washington.</p>
<p>This is truly disgraceful.<br>

			<p>NOW, all of the sick South of the border jumpers will be coming up for medical treatment, even if they hadn&rsquo;t planned to come already.</p>

			<p>The whole disease itself is HIGHLY suspicious.  Suspicious in that, person to person contact should be impossible.  Instead, it&rsquo;s not just possible, it&rsquo;s widespread.</p>
<p>Folks.  This is a weaponized germ.  Like everything else the mexicans do, their biowarfare program was halfassed&hellip;..and one of their bugs got away from them.</p>
<p>The very first thing we should do is militarize our border and shoot anyone who tries to cross.  Shut down ALL movement from mexico to the US.  Then, the germ needs to be examined for signs its been genetically engineered.  If evidence is found, mexico should be made to pay a high price.  A ban on all trade with the US would be an appropriate first step.  Mass deportations would be a reasonable second.</p>

<p>Why is this disease &#8220;suspicious&#8221;?  Why should person-to-person contact be impossible?  Read up on influenza in scientific journals (many of which are online) and not some crackpot conspiracy website (undoubtedly written by a medical dilettante).  The virus family Orthomyxoviridae (which produces the flu) has five genera; the one that has epidemiologists worried is Influenza Virus A, which has one species but many variants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this species (usually but not always found in wild aquatic birds) that can from time to time cross the species barrier and produce pestilent strains, killing huge numbers of humans (as it did during the Spanish &amp; Hong Kong flu influenza epidemics).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.horizonpress.com/avir" rel="nofollow">https://www.horizonpress.com/avir</a></p>
<p>There is simply no evidence this strain (actually at least two strains identified so far) was &#8220;weaponized.&#8221;  In fact, the whole idea of weaponizing the flu virus is retarded, since anyone crazy enough to release such a virus would surely suffer a Cadmean victory.</p>

<p>The whole point of this article is that Mexico is a veritable breeding ground of pathogens due to a virtually non-existent medical infrastructure necessary to identify and possibly contain them when they arise.  Add to that the fact that hundreds of thousands of Mexican peons (illegally) cross our borders annually, and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>
