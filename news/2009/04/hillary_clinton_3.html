<h1>Hillary Clinton: Haiti, Cuba Policies Are Under Review</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacqueline Charles, Miami Herald, April 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday the Obama administration is reviewing a U.S. policy of deporting undocumented Haitians and left open the possibility of expanding travel to Havana beyond the families of Cuban exiles in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She travels Thursday to Port-au-Prince and the Dominican Republic, then links up with President Barack Obama in Port of Spain to bring a message of engagement and collaboration.</p>
<p>Clinton made clear that the United States would retain its policy of interdicting Haitians trying to reach Florida&rsquo;s sun-drenched shores but said the administration was looking at its deportation practices involving Haitians, who help support their impoverished country with remittances.</p>
<p>UNDER REVIEW</p>
<p>&#8220;We are reviewing the policy, and we know what a great source of income the remittances are that flow from &hellip; principally the United States back to Haiti,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>An estimated 30,000 Haitians are currently in the deportation pipeline, and immigration advocates argue it would be cruel to send them back to a storm-ravaged country struggling to recover from four back-to-back storms that left nearly $1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>Clinton said the administration was sympathetic to &#8220;what a tremendous burden it would be on Haiti if all of a sudden they were forced to accommodate the thousands of people who were otherwise working in our country.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we expect that we will be able to look closely at this and try to come up with some appropriate responses to the challenges posed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haitian advocates want the Obama administration to add Haiti to the list of nations whose citizens here receive Temporary Protected Status. That would permit undocumented Haitian migrants to stay and work in the United States temporarily.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s trip to Port-au-Prince Thursday follows a donors conference held Tuesday in Washington in which nations and financial organizations pledged $324 million to Haiti. Clinton stressed that the U.S. pledge of $57 million was focused on enhancing security in Haiti, investment in job creation and helping the Haitian diaspora contribute their talent to their homeland.</p>

<p>I would bet more are involved in criminal activities than are working, while the rest are scamming the dumb white taxpayers </p>

<p>She IS however, willing to thrust the financial, medical, criminal and social burden of ALL of the &#8220;Haitian boat people&#8221; on the usual suspects (the U.S. taxpaying slave)</p>

Oh my god, I think they are trying to get the Haitians in on the &#8220;wet foot, dry foot&#8221; racket.</p>
<p>Cubans get to stay in the US if they can set foot on US soil.  If they are caught on the sea, they are returned.  This pisses off Haitians because they see their plight as identical.</p>
<p>So here I think Obama may be trying to insinuate them into this policy.  What a nightmare that would be.</p>

			<p>Just as Mexicans don&rsquo;t understand the word &#8220;illegal,&#8221; Our esteemed leaders do not understand the word &#8220;temporary,&#8221; when it comes time for refugees to go home.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Administration may allow Haitian illegals to stay &ldquo;temporarily.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Besides that, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re considering bringing in some more Somalis of the type who pirated our ship and those who dragged our dead military men through the streets and hung them by their feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering how many of the Haitians who are given &#8220;refuge&#8221; here are now selling drugs, since Haitian gangs in the US have carved out a nice little niche for themselves adding to our tribal third world entrpreneurs, more so, percentagewise, than other nationalities.</p>
<p>Anybody but a fool is able to see this influx of third worlders for the last several years is literally destroying this country.</p>
<p>If we lose jobs at the same rate for the next two years we have lost these last 6 months, as expected, where on earth are these people going to work?  Yet they keep bringing them in as if we&rsquo;re in the middle of a forty-niners type gold rush, and we desperately need more labor.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder aware people regard leftist dregs as simpletons who are mentally disabled?  Have you ever wondered if these &#8220;in the know&#8221; MSM &#8220;journalists&#8221; supporting this policy even have a brain at all?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary knowing that these mentally challenged people greatly influence the policy of this nation.  </p>
<p>The newspapers are all going under.  If the T.V. talking heads would collapse economically as well, how much better off we would be.</p>
<p>But, as it is they won&rsquo;t, and the entire country will collapse.  And, when the analysis is done as to the reasons why, it will be these same people who will step forward and declare it was due to some right wing action, just as they blamed the sub-prime collapse on greedy bankers instead of leftist power mongers who FORCED these same greedy lenders to give loans to non-whites who couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay for them.</p>
<p>There is no way a white nation can survive with these kinds of white incompetents having any kind of influence.  No way.</p>
<p>Bill O&rsquo;Reilly said we are at the beginning of a civil war with these leftists.  I&rsquo;m just wondering if the country might split along lines of ideology, as well as race, in about 2015, when the depression is at its worst point.<br>

			<p>The Democratic party&rsquo;s strategy is to import its non-white voting  base. If the Democratic party had to  rely exclusively on a White voting base since 1965, it would be  marginal insignificant party by now.</p>
<p>What the Democratic party is doing is really outrageous. Not doubt about it&hellip;it  is full-blown  treason for a political party to import its voting block from overseas so as to win major American elections year in and year out. But it it is more than just treason. The Democratic party is waging an aggresive race war against the majority Native Born White American population. The Republican party&rsquo;s response to the aggressive race war being waged the Democratic party:wage an aggressive race war against the majority Native Born White American population. </p>
<p>The salvation and long term survival of the Native Born White American population as a large racial majority within the borders of America requires the complete destruction of the Republican party. Peter Brimelow and Steve Sailer are wasting their time trying to save the Republican party. It will never change its ways. The only game in town for Native White Americans is uncompromising White Nationlaism which has at its core the complete rejection of the Republica-Democratic Beltway consensus to reduce Native Born White American majority to a ever dwindling racial minority within the borders where they will face vicious discramination and viooence at the hands of post-1965 asians,muslims,hispanics and africans.<br>
The Republican party-Peter Brimelow nothwithstanding-not the stupid party. The Republican a party knows exactly what it is doing. As far as the legitimate racial interests of the majority Native Born White American population goes, the Republican party is the evil party.</p>

			<p>A new civil war?  I believe that we&rsquo;re at about 1859 right now. Once a critical mass of people don&rsquo;t have jobs any more and lots of time to devote to protest, things are going to get interesting.</p>

			<p>and here is some forgotten haiti history if you think they should stay here. <br>
Dessalines, who had commanded the black and the mulatto forces during the final phase of the revolution, became the new country&rsquo;s leader; he ruled under the dictatorial 1801 constitution. The land he governed had been devastated by years of warfare. The agricultural base was all but destroyed, and the population was uneducated and largely unskilled. Commerce was virtually nonexistent. Contemplating this bleak situation, Dessalines determined, as Toussaint had done, that a firm hand was needed. </p>
<p>White residents felt the sting most sharply. While Toussaint, a former privileged slave of a tolerant white master, had felt a certain magnanimity toward whites, Dessalines, a former field slave, despised them with a maniacal intensity. He reportedly agreed wholeheartedly with his aide, Boisrond-Tonnerre, who stated, &#8220;For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!&#8221; Accordingly, whites were slaughtered wholesale under the rule of Dessalines<br>

			<p>Bleeding hearts in government are always worried that it might be cruel to send illegal aliens back to their third world dumps that they created. These officials should realize it is cruel to US citizens to inflict thousands of  3ird world immigrants on them many of whom commit crimes and exploit our social services and hospital emergency rooms. </p>
<p>Government should reminded that the welfare of its citizens are it&rsquo;s first &amp; foremost concern.</p>
