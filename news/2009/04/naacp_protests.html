<h1>NAACP Protests Outside Orlando Magic Game</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Kunerth, Orlando Sentinel Staff Writer, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About two dozen members of the local NAACP picketed outside Amway Arena on Tuesday night, protesting the lack of construction jobs for Parramore residents at the events center, as thousands of fans streamed into the arena to see the Orlando Magic play the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP says the team and the city have failed to live up to promises to make a &#8220;significant effort&#8221; to hire black-owned firms and residents of the adjacent Parramore neighborhood in building the $480 million events center, the Magic&rsquo;s new home under construction a few blocks from Amway Arena.</p>
<p>Only a small number of jobs on the construction site have gone to black workers in a neighborhood that is 95 percent black, Bracy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Construction began in July 2008, and from that time to now they have deliberately not played fair,&#8221; Bracy said. &#8220;They have not done what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orlando officials and the Magic say they have exceeded the goal of having minority-owned businesses receive 24 percent of events-center contracts, as called for in an agreement between the city and the team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, 34.6 percent of the contracts  &mdash;  worth $77.8 million  &mdash;  have gone to minority businesses, Glass [Joel Glass, spokesman for the Magic] said.</p>
<p>The latest figures, he said, show that 46 African-American businesses have been awarded contracts, compared with 28 Hispanic-owned businesses, 17 Asian businesses and 37 women-owned businesses. Since Feb. 13, he said, 25 workers have been hired by the city  &mdash;  24 of them from predominantly black neighborhoods in west Orlando.</p>
<p>The NAACP counters that while there may be more black firms, the Hispanic-owned construction companies received 18 percent of the contracts versus 8 percent for black businesses.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.myfoxorlando.com/dpp/news/042709_More_minority_contracts_awarded_for_Events_Center">More Minority Contracts Awarded for Events Center</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>WOFL-TV (Orlando), April 27, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Orlando Magic released information on Monday about minority participation in the construction of the Orlando Events Center. The city has outlined a blueprint for construction where 24 percent of all contracts would be awarded to minority-owned and women-owned businesses.</p>
<p>To date, the city reports almost 35 percent minority contracts have been issued to several companies, including some in neighboring Parramore, equaling around $78 million.</p>
<p>More than 120 minority and women firms are under contract (46 African-American owned, 28 Hispanic- American owned, 17 Asian-American owned, 37 women-owned). Since February 13, twenty-five workers have been hired via the City workforce program.</p>
<p>Construction is on schedule for the facilty, which will ultimately house the Orlando Magic and the Orlando Predators. It also will compete to host major national events, concerts and family shows.</p>

Blacks pushed for minority participation and diversity because those and other ideas were code for black.</p>
<p>By demanding diversity, they have opened the door to a world of diversity they never expected or wanted. Once again, give blacks what they ask for and watch them destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Does anyone want to take bets on how long the mythical black-brown coalition will last (if it ever existed at all)?</p>

			<p>Black &#8220;contractors&#8221; being beat out by Hispanics?  (Mainly because of cheap labor).  What is the NAACP&rsquo;s immigration position?  Amnesty and open borders all the way.  You made your own bed, now sleep in it.</p>

			<p>Last night black star player Dwight Howard for the Magic was suspended for the next playoff game by the NBA for hitting a player on the 76ers. So you know the NAACP will be back,I mean he is only suspended becaus of racism.</p>

			<p>Florida is pretty much a non union state.  Construction is one of the occupations taken over by illegal hispanics.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong NAACP??  Post office, social security and other government agencies don&rsquo;t have enough jobs to absorb every black in the country?</p>
<p>Boo hoo, sob sob</p>

<p>Turns out <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/3534" rel="nofollow">the guy he clobbered is also black</a>, which was to be expected since it&rsquo;s almost impossible to find a non-black on an NBA floor.</p>
<p>Of course Parramore, like any other black neighborhood, is a filthy ghetto precisely because it&rsquo;s black. So why should any reputable contractor, even a minority, want to have anything to do with those residents and their sloth, drunkenness, drug addiction, thievery and other social pathologies?</p>

			<p>Why would you build a new, state of the art, stadium in a poor BLACK neighborhood!!! Between the high crime that will be in and around this stadium, and the local &#8216;shake-down&rsquo; artists [commonly know as &#8216;community activists&rsquo;], this place will be shut down with-in 10 years. </p>

			<p>Do blacks understand that every new immigrant who enters the U.S. pushes them down farther?  I&rsquo;m assuming they don&rsquo;t.  This even goes for african and west indian immigrants, who businesses and universities routinely favor over american blacks.</p>
<p>The NAACP should be fervently against immigration, particularly from the third world.  The incoming immigrants snear at blacks, and want as little to do with them as possible.  Any cooperation for welfare and the like is only temporary, and will surely be outweighed by increased competition for resources and a strained U.S. economy.  The best chance blacks have of keeping their privileged minority status is living in a stable, majority white country.  The NAACP is doing their people no favors.    </p>

			<p>About 13 years ago, I had to walk with my wife and youngest son from a tourist area in Orlando to the Arena. It has been the only time in the past 20 years that I stopped and chambered a round in my carry weapon. Nuff said.</p>

			<p>How far away is the new arena from Amway Arena? is it still on the fringe of downtown?</p>

<p>The new arena is only a few blocks from the old one. Not as close as the new Yankee Stadium is to the old, but still close.</p>

			<p>The neighborhood they are talking about has been a hellish drug/crime zone for decades.  A few years ago they bulldozed the &#8220;projects&#8221; but the neighborhood is still hellish.  Consider it is flanked by Orange Blossom trail, a world-known hooker hangout, the county jail (in Orlando it&rsquo;s just called 33rd because it&rsquo;s on 33rd street), I-4 and it borders Pine hills which has been called &#8220;Crime Hills&#8221; for at least 20 years.  </p>
<p>Now that you have that in mind consider that it is unlikely anyone in Parramore is untouched by the drug trade or other crimes.  How on earth would they get a construction job?  Most can&rsquo;t get beyond the drug test.  The NAACP probably can&rsquo;t pass a drug test either.  But this protest is not about any of that.  They knew going in that they were going to have to get their money by protesting the unjust hiring practices.  To be honest, they should have hired hundreds of them and then made them do nothing.  I would probably have saved them money and blood pressure.  Ultimately that&rsquo;s all they want, a free ride.</p>
<p>They are too stupid to know a free ride has no future.  So I say give it to them so we can be rid of them.  Why can&rsquo;t we create zones these kinds of fools would naturally gravitate toward.    Call it cultural fly paper.  </p>
<p>They tried it in Atlanta, but it failed miserably.  White people will not adopt &#8220;The ATL&#8221; as a way of referring to home.  So the $2M they spent to write and produce a hip hop &#8220;branding&#8221; song for Atlanta also failed likely because once again white people don&rsquo;t like to hear &#8220;get &#8216;em up Get em up&#8221; in a branding song to remind them of their most recent mugging or MARTA experience.</p>
<p>But Alabama would be seen by black as a major trophy, even more symbolic than Atlanta.  It&rsquo;s just a thought and I&rsquo;m sure plenty of white folks from Alabama would not like to hear such a plan (trust me, you live in a hole of a state, move soon!)</p>
