<h1>Sharia Infiltrates German Courts, Schools, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sami Alrabaa, Family Security Matters, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once again a German court ruled by referring to Shrai&rsquo;a (Islamic law), which predominantly incites to denigration of women, hatred, violence.</p>
<p>Most recently, Lisa, a German woman (46) married to an Egyptian, called the police seeking protection for herself and her 17-year-old daughter from assaults by her husband. Magdi, Lisa&rsquo;s husband, threatened to kill their daughter who had been raped by a man. Magdi, a practicing Muslim, believes that his daughter committed &#8220;Zena&#8221; (adultery). He told his wife that he was always suspicious of his daughter who clandestinely had a German boyfriend. Lisa filed a divorce case against her husband, and requested deporting him.</p>
<p>The judge, Matthias Rau, at a court in Hanover, Germany, ruled (January 21, 2009), Lisa had to wait for at least one year before she is legally divorced. Her husband cannot be deported. &#8220;He must be re-educated, in hopes he would renounce his Islamic understanding of &#8216;Zena,&rsquo;&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>The German judge argued, &#8220;Muslims have a different understanding of rape than Europeans, and this must be taken into account.&#8221; </p>
<p>In an interview with a German radio, NDR on February 18, 2009, Rau said, &#8220;Sharia aligns rape to adultery, Zena, and victims  &mdash;  women  &mdash;  are often punished instead of prosecuting the perpetrators and convict them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helmut Wagner, another German judge, this time in Essen, ruled March 2, 2009, Muslim girls in Germany can not be forced to swim in public and learn about the evolution theory at school. The parents of three school girls requested a verdict freeing their daughters from taking part in swimming classes and lessons which teach the evolution theory. Wagner argued, &#8220;These things contradict tenets in Islam, the religion of these girls, and hence in light of freedom of religion, the Muslim girls cannot be forced to do or learn things which are incompatible with their religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Attorney General was indignant. He objected to Wagner&rsquo;s verdict by saying, &#8220;How would this judge rule if a Muslim kills someone who commits apostasy. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>The attorney General added, &#8220;In Islam, polygamy is permissible. Should also this be sanctioned in Germany for Muslims? It seems to me that some German judges are more royal than the king and more Catholic than the Pope. Some Arab countries use Western legal codes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Numerous cases have now been ruled with reference to Sharia in Germany. Earlier in 2007, Christa Datz-Winter, a judge in Frankfurt, also referred to a passage in the Koran that gives the right to a husband to beat his wife. She procrastinated the divorce of a Moroccan women from her Moroccan husband, Both live in Germany.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Andrea Bramsche, a lawyer in Stuttgart, Germany, told the prominent weekly newspaper, Die Zeit online, (February 19, 2009), &#8220;What is going on in German courts? Are we here in Saudi Arabia or Iran? Even some Muslim countries are obviously more secular than we are. Syria, Lebanon, and Tunisia, for example, apply the Napoleon code, and Turkey uses the Swiss code. Besides, would a Saudi judge rule allowing a German to drink alcohol in Saudi Arabia because the Bible allows that?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If German courts opt to use Sharia in their verdicts then women can be beaten, their testimony is worth half of that of men, they are disallowed to travel alone, they can inherit only half the mount their male relatives get. Women are intellectually deficient. They even cannot fast without their husband&rsquo;s permission, etc. All these commandments are entailed in Sharia.   </p>
<p>Sharia has also infiltrated German schools. The head teacher of a secondary school in Detmold permits Muslim pupils who do not want to learn the evolution theory to learn the &#8220;creationist theory&#8221; as an alternative.</p>
<p>In another school, the head teacher issued instructions to male teachers not to shake hands with Muslim girls after handing over their graduation documents. &#8220;This is haram (impermissible) in Islam.&#8221; The head teacher said.</p>
<p>Sharia has also infiltrated the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In an interview with the Egyptian Al Ahram Weekly (October 19, 2008), Gabrielle Linda Guelil, a Muslim Turk, whose real first name is Layla and who dyes her hair blond to look German, and works for this ministry as head of a new section called &#8220;Dialogue with the Islamic World,&#8221; said, &#8220;Through interaction and dialogue with the Muslim world we hope to bridge the gap between cultures and clear up any misunderstandings.&#8221;</p>
<p>What kind of &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221; is Guelil talking about? Are &#8220;beating women&#8221; and urging Muslims to kill infidels  &mdash;  Christians and Jews  &mdash;  which the Koran, Hadith, and fatwas (edicts) incite to, all &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221;? This is an insult to the intellect of all sanely-thinking people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead of lecturing us about &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; Guelil should have asked Muslims to be tolerant and renounce violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many German apologists, and for that matter many Europeans like the British Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams who endorses Sharia, argue that Muslims living in the West must have their own law, Sharia, applied next to the mundane law. They justify that by religious freedom which all Western constitutions prescribe.</p>
<p>They also argue that in a bid to integrate migrants of different religious backgrounds, these people must &#8220;feel at home.&#8221; Their religious tenets must be taken into consideration. But how about Western mundane laws and constitutions, do they use the Bible or refer to it? The answer is NO.</p>

			<p>What do these foolish European women who marry Muslims expect? They want to be seen as progressive and anti-racist at the cost of having their own offspring murdered. I feel sorry for the actual Muslim women married to Muslim men but that is the West&rsquo;s problem and should not be made the West&rsquo;s problem because these people show up on our doorstep.</p>

			<p>Interesting that the author of this article is, himself, Arab.  I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s Muslim.  Judge Wagner should be deported to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Geez some of these people are idiots. No, if muslims want Sharia, they need to GO HOME!!!! The truth of the matter, in the laws of most western countries, there is a seperation between religion and state/courts etc.  People are free to practice whatever religion they want in private so long as they do not break the laws of the country. Here in the USA, a small morman sect was secretly practicing forced marriage of young underage girls and the members doing this were arrested. They argued that it was their religion and were told you can practice what religion you want as long as you do not break american law and american law forbids forcing young underage girls into marriage. Muslims can practice islam but when it interferes with european law such as committing honor killings then no, they do not have the right.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The German judge argued, &ldquo;Muslims have a different understanding of rape than Europeans, and this must be taken into account.&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>No, it shouldn&rsquo;t be taken into account. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what muslims think about rape or anything else. When one moves to another country, one should learn and abide by that country&rsquo;s laws. If muslims can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do this, they should leave and the courts should in no way change for them.</p>

			<p>Does everyone know that the State Department issued warnings to women in college with Middle Eastern men, NOT TO MARRY THEM?? this warning totally &#8216;outraged&rsquo; the muslims in Saudi and Kuwait, with Saudi being the greatest threat to Western women.</p>

<p>As long as the practitioners were not white and not christian, who knows what some of the dopey far left would allow.<br>

			<p>Yet another example of why we should cherish and defend our nation&rsquo;s separation of church and state.  Religious dogma must not be allowed to subvert our laws.</p>
