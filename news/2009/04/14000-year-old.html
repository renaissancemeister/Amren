<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30153685/">14,000-Year-Old Hunting Kit Found in Scotland</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Viegas, MSNBC, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Archaeologists have just identified the oldest evidence for humans in Scotland, a fairly sophisticated 14,000-year-old toolkit that may have been used to hunt and prepare big game from the region.</p>
<p>According to a report in the latest British Archaeology, the flint artifacts constitute the most northern evidence for the earliest people in Britain.</p>
<p>Alan Saville, senior curator of Earliest Prehistory at National Museums Scotland, worked on the project. He told Discovery News that the toolkit find is &#8220;exciting&#8221; for two main reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly, it pushes back the earliest occupation of Scotland by some 3,000 years, and is the first real evidence for Upper Paleolithic open-air settlement occupation north of the English Midlands,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, it appears to represent a technological variant which has not been recognized anywhere else in Britain,&#8221; he added, explaining that the style of the tools matches hunting implements from southern Denmark and northern Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now believed people from those regions made their way to Scotland via a large land bridge called Doggerland, which connected the island of Great Britain to mainland Europe during the last ice age. The individuals in this case likely belonged to the Hamburg culture, known for its reindeer-hunting prowess.</p>
<p>Early Scotland supported herds of reindeer, along with mammoths, rhinos, horses and other large animals. The climate &#8220;fluctuated wildly&#8221; at the end of the ice age, resulting in more moderate temperatures, but also icy cold snaps that caused the reappearance of glaciers in the highlands.</p>
<p>Scientists unearthed the prehistoric tools in a field at Howburn Farm, Elsrickle, South Lanarkshire, in the southern part of Scotland.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tool types involve particularly a couple of tanged points (projectile heads), but also burins, end-of-blade scrapers, and a piercer of so-called Zinken-type, as well as there being evidence for a certain type of blade-core preparation technique known as en eperon,&#8221; Saville said.</p>
<p>A burin was a flaked rock tool with a chisel-like edge probably used to remove flesh from bone. &#8220;Eperon&#8221; means &#8220;spur&#8221; in French. Here it refers to a blade with a thick-ended butt at one end.</p>
<p>The toolkit suggests there were at least two major technologies in early Britain: Hamburgian and Creswellian. The latter was characterized by &#8220;Cheddar points,&#8221; tools with trapezoidal-backed blades.</p>
<p>Saville thinks early hunters followed migrating herds of big game beasts, &#8220;and that human groups would follow these migrations of what was a major food source for the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We have no way of calculating numbers or densities, but the general assumption must be that inhabitation was low-level and sporadic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archaeologist Mike Pitts, editor of British Archaeology, suggested to Discovery News that the nature of this find  &mdash;  researchers simply digging up flint tools at a Scottish farm  &mdash;  shows &#8220;what you can do without a lot of expensive technology or lengthy project designs.&#8221; He said he made similar discoveries &#8220;while still at school walking over ploughed fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents and visitors to Scotland might therefore do well to look downward while walking, as they could stumble upon the next big archaeological find.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Scotland now,&#8221; Pitts said, &#8220;the search is on for sites of this age with well-preserved stratigraphy that would hold out hope for seeing just what these people (the first Scots) then were doing.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I recently saw a show on the natgeo or discovery channel, I do not remember which, about an item found in germany, made with materials from the area that represented certain figures, including a boat, the sun and stars. It was dated earlier than similiar items with such symbology in Egypt, yet they insisted that the symbology must have come from egypt, because obviously the germans were incapable of producing something like it on their own. It strikes me that because of our Judeo-Christian heritage and previous archeological timeline theories that we are very willing to ignore the history of european peoples even when it is staring us in the face.</p>

			<p>What we already know about the Great Britain is that about 80% of the genetic base there now was already settled there near the end of the last Ice Age, 8,000 years ago. All of the so-called invasions - Roman, Viking, Saxon, Norman - only altered the gene pool by about 20%. Yet in the just 2 generations of so-called &#8220;immigration&#8221; that gene pool will be altered by more than it has in the last 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Who were the immigrants and who were the invaders?</p>
<p>There is no way to comprehend the fanaticism, insanity and immorality of our current crop of political leaders.</p>

			<p>The QUESTION IS how long will the descendents of those people still be in control of Scotland?</p>

			<p>Yep, it will be only a matter of time that the blacks will claim that it belonged to a black who was the first to set foot in Scotland and whitey stole the knife from him.</p>

			<p>Weren&rsquo;t the original inhabitants of Scotland an Irish tribe called the Scotti?</p>
