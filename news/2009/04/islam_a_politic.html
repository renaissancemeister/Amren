			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Buch-Andersen, BBC News, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With less than six months to go until Norway&rsquo;s general election, increasing tensions over immigration and Islam appear likely to play a significant role in the vote.</p>
<p>The leader of the country&rsquo;s main opposition party has warned that it is facing &#8220;sneak-Islamisation&#8221;, while some prominent Muslims say they face growing &#8220;persecution&#8221;.</p>
<p>The heated debate is a sign that Norway, renowned as one of the most peaceful and tolerant nations in the world, is facing the same issues with its Muslim minority as are now familiar in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Siv Jensen, the 39-year-old leader of the opposition Progress Party, has objected to moves to introduce special measures in order to accommodate Muslims&rsquo; religious sensitivities, traditions and rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that a kind of sneak-Islamisation of this society is being allowed,&#8221; she recently told a Progress Party conference. &#8220;We are going to have to stop this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opinion polls suggest the party could win as much as 30% of the vote in the election for the national parliament, the Storting, in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Progress Party gets to govern Norway, we will enforce Norwegian law and Norwegian rules. We are not going to allow special demands from any single group in society,&#8221; Ms Jensen added.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Islamophobia&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Khalid Mahmood, a Pakistani-born member of the governing Labour Party believes Muslims are being persecuted, and Islam confronted with hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslims are the Jews of our times, stigmatised, generalised and presented as a threat to society&#8221;, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not any longer immigrants who are targeted, but simply Muslims&#8221;, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are portrayed as uncivilised people living double lives  &mdash;  orderly and behaved when in public, but at home fundamentalists suppressing and physically abusing women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), the racism watchdog of the Council of Europe, published a report warning that Islamophobia was on the rise in Norway.</p>
<p>Specifically, the commissioned highlighted the increasingly aggressive rhetoric of the Progress Party.</p>
<p>With an estimated 150,000 of Norway&rsquo;s almost five million population being Muslims, Islam is the second-biggest religion in the country.</p>
<p>But while Norway was ranked the most peaceful country in the world by the World Peace Index in 2007, it is struggling to integrate its religious minorities.</p>
<p>In some places, Islamic traditions clash with the largely non-religious Scandinavian way of life.</p>
<p><b>Culture clash</b></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Labour Party&rsquo;s governing coalition suggested it would allow police officers to wear headscarves with their uniform, in the hope that it would attract more Muslim women to the police force.</p>
<p>But after widespread criticism of the proposal, the government dropped the idea.</p>
<p>On International Women&rsquo;s Day in March, Syrian-born Sara Azmeh Rasmussen protested against headscarves by burning hers in public in the capital, Oslo.</p>
<p>Ms Jensen&rsquo;s Progress Party has produced a list of special measures it says Muslims have requested to accommodate their religious sensitivities and traditions.</p>
<p>On top of changes to the police uniform, the list mentions prison inmates wanting Halal food, and parents of teenage girls demanding that schools separate their daughters from boys during sports lessons.</p>
<p>Most of her supporters say it is her hardline stand against Islamic values and rules that make her their favourite candidate.</p>
<p>Some polls suggest that Ms Jensen&rsquo;s party could win the election, and that she could become the country&rsquo;s next prime minister  &mdash;  though to do so she would have to secure the support of other parties like the Conservatives, the Liberals and Christian Democrats.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Empty rhetoric&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The significant success of the Progress Party has forced the governing Labour Party to react.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government tightened asylum rules despite earlier pledges not to do so.</p>
<p>And last month, senior members of the Labour Party called for a fight against radical Islam in Norway.</p>
<p>However, the former prime minister and Labour Party leader, Thorbjoern Jagland, called it an unnecessary fight that would only lead to confrontation.</p>
<p>While he argued that it was empty rhetoric, saying there was no radical Islam in Norway, the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) insists radical Islam does represent a threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Norway, extreme Islamist activity is carried out by small groups. However, the international connections the persons in these groups represent, in addition to activities they carry out, are such in nature that they can also influence that national threat picture,&#8221; it said in a recent report.</p>
<p>While the debate is getting more heated, not all Muslims agree with Mr Mahmood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three to four articles critical of religion and the burning of a headscarf is not persecution of Muslims; it is a process of modernising,&#8221; says Shakil Rehman, another Labour Party member.</p>
<p>&#8220;Criticism isn&rsquo;t a smear campaign, but necessary progress.&#8221;<br>

&#8220;Islam a Political Target in Norway&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Well, either Norway makes Islam a political target or Islam will make Norway a political target. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. </p>
<p>And the same can be said for every other country in Europe: instead of &#8220;Norway&#8221; just substitute &#8220;Netherlands&#8221; or &#8220;France&#8221; or &#8220;UK.&#8221; </p>

<p>Not true. White men are the Jews of our time. Seen as cause of all world problems in the past, up to whatever day it is today, legislated against endlessly, and seemingly targeted for virtual extermination.  </p>

<p>They can tighten the rules all they want but it won&rsquo;t make any difference because they don&rsquo;t enforce them. There is always some &#8216;humanitarian&rsquo; loophole that allows even rejected people to stay. In Western countries, if you have dark skin and can sneak across a border you are in for life.</p>

			<p>If liberals in Norway don&rsquo;t like the political climate, they should blame themselves for forcing &#8220;diversity&#8221; down their countrymen&rsquo;s throats.  This is what happens when there is no moderate political party looking out for the interests of the indigenous population.  Moderates who don&rsquo;t ordinarily support nationalist parties feel they have no alternative  &mdash;  and chances are they&rsquo;re exactly right.  Liberals should thank themselves for nationalist movements gaining steam all over globe.</p>

<p>No you are not. Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years by Christians (and Muslims sometimes) for no reason other than being Jews. Jews are now again persecuted by Muslims and Islam (along with everybody else non-muslim). Jews never tried to force their religion or way on life on anyone. Jews never bombarded civilians with rockets. Jews never sent suicide bombers/carbombs and the like. Jews never crashed planes into buildings killing thousands and I could go on and on.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of cynicism to blame Jews for anything under the sun, declare war on them and them pretend to be the &#8220;new Jew&#8221;.</p>
<p>But hey, that&rsquo;s so typically Muslim to say that, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anythng different from you. <br>

			<p>Neither liberals nor muslims seem to realize that the muslim culture produces failed societies.  That&rsquo;s why all the white nations of the Earth are being flooded by a sea of these people as they escape the poverty and violence that are the cornerstone of life in the muslim world.  Yet when they arrive in their new homes, their sole desire seems nothing short of an attempt to force these adopted countries to adapt to their ways.  This way they can recreate that which they sought to flee.  Why are we letting them in?  Why do we put up with their demands and their nonsense?  Thye have nothing of benefit to offer us!  They are a threat to our culture and our way of life.</p>
<p>Muslims as the Jews of our day?  What nonsense coming from a people for whom the basic tenet of their religion is &#8220;death to the infidels!&#8221;.  There is no integration with these people.  It&rsquo;s massive population growth, then take over due to shear numbers.</p>

In that case you need have no wories, white man.  Relax!   The Jews came through it and in fact seem to have done quite well for themselves.   </p>

<p>They followed the well beaten path made by the previous 2 million!! Surely the 150,000 figure for muslims is only about 10% of the real number there. And they are NOT plain old muslims, they are black muslims from violent prone black sub-Sahara Africa. SAHARA BTW, is a contraction of the Arabic word for &#8216;desert&rsquo;</p>

<p>I would be more worried about 20 blacks. It&rsquo;s over for whites in Scandinavia. No doubt they&rsquo;ll be partitioned off onto a smaller reservation. I hope they like Saab automobiles. </p>

			<p>Left wing Scandanavians are in a box.  Their vaunted tolerance has led them to this impasse, and now they must either abandon that tolerance in order to deal with the threat from Islam, or they must &#8220;tolerate&#8221; an Islam which will eviscerate their tolerant political system.  Now THAT is truly a Hobson&rsquo;s Choice.  And mind, there is not going to be a third way out of this from which they can wiesel.  Either they change Islam or it will change them.  Don&rsquo;t count on any kind of nationalist backbone suddenly growing out of this pseudo-Marxist society.  Ain&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>

			<p>A Muslim colonist in Norway states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are portrayed as uncivilised people living double lives &mdash; orderly and behaved when in public, but at home fundamentalists suppressing and physically abusing women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is effective propaganda for our side - it works, that is why the Norwegian Progress Party is in a position to win 30% of the vote, instead of the 0-1% that American libertarian, Constitutionalists, economic conservatives win here in the USA.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent video working against the proposed HR 1913 Federal Hate Crimes Law - the video argues the law will make a it a thought crime to criticize radical islam.</p>

<p>You raise a very interesting point.  I have read a lot about the plight of the &#8220;naziyngel&#8221; (lit: &#8220;Nazi spawn&#8221;) in Norway.  These children were the product of Himmler&rsquo;s &#8220;lebensborn&#8221; progam in that country.  It&rsquo;s estimated about 12,000 of these children were born to Norwegian mothers and German fathers.</p>
<p>After the war (and the executions of hundreds of collaborators) the Norwegians turned their anti-German fury on these unfortunate innocents, to the point that in many cases the mothers of these kids abandoned them in orphanages rather than be associated with them.</p>
<p>Norwegian citizens literally brutalized them, while the government either ignored the problem or actually &#8220;joined in the fun.&#8221;  At one point the government even tried to forcibly deport most of these children and their mothers to Australia!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/1324127/Norwegian-government-sued-over-children-Nazis-left-behind.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/1324127/Norwegian-government-sued-over-children-Nazis-left-behind.html</a></p>
<p>https://www.bt.no/kultur/article114048.ece</p>
<p>The problem wasn&rsquo;t even acknowledged until 1981 and little was done about it until fairly recently.</p>
<p>Why do I even bring all this up?  Simple: the Norwegians were perfectly willing to do all sorts of barbaric things to their own kinsmen for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of being sired by enemy soldiers, yet the majority of them (like their neighbors, the Swedes) seem perfectly willing to bend over backwards and forwards to accomadate alien non-Whites who have nothing but malicious intent towards them at heart.</p>

<p>It is precisely this neo-marxist, dysgenic-style of thinking, going on throughout the West, that is at the heart of the undoing of the White man.  There can be no other word for it: stupid!<br>
