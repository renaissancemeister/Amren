<h1>Racial Disparities Persist in Higher-Paying Jobs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, AP, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blacks and Hispanics lag behind whites for higher-paying jobs at the largest rates in about a decade as employment opportunities dwindled during the nation&rsquo;s economic woes and housing slump.</p>
<p>Census data released Monday show an increasingly educated U.S. work force whose earnings didn&rsquo;t always seem to match up with its potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lesson of most economic downturns is minorities are the last hired, first fired. They lose jobs more quickly, and they will be the last to recover,&#8221; said Roderick Harrison, a demographer at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank that studies minority issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks overall slightly narrowed the gap in 2007 with whites in average salary, but the pay disparity widened for blacks with college degrees. Blacks who had a four-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree earned $46,502, or about 78 percent of the salary for comparably educated whites.</p>
<p>It was the biggest disparity between professional blacks and whites since the 77 percent rate in 2001, when the U.S. fell into a recession due to the collapse of the tech bubble and the Sept. 11 terror attacks. College-educated blacks had previously earned as much as 83 percent of the average salary of whites in 2005.</p>
<p>Hispanics saw similar trends.</p>
<p>Those with high school diplomas earned about 83 cents for whites&rsquo; every dollar, largely unchanged from a decade ago. But Hispanics with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees had an average salary of $44,696, amounting to roughly 75 cents for every dollar made by whites  &mdash;  the lowest ratio in more than a decade  &mdash;  after hitting a peak of 87 cents to every dollar in 2000.</p>
<p>The numbers highlight some of the barriers for minorities, said Mark Mather, a demographer for the Population Reference Bureau. He said the pay disparities could widen further since blacks and Hispanics tend to be relative latecomers to the professional world and thus more vulnerable to layoffs in the current recession.</p>
<p>In 2008, a record number of workers filed federal job discrimination complaints, with allegations of race discrimination making up the greatest portion at more than one-third of the 95,000 total claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 92 percent of white adults had at least a high school diploma, compared with 89 percent for Asians, 83 percent for blacks and 62 percent for Hispanics.</p>
<p>Black adults in recent years narrowed the gap with white adults in earning high school diplomas, but the gap has generally widened for college degrees. About 33 percent of white adults had at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 2008, compared with 20 percent for blacks and 13 percent for Hispanics.</p>
<p>More than half, or 53 percent, of Asian adults had at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Foreign-born U.S. residents, which include illegal immigrants, were three times more likely than native-born to lack a high school diploma.</p>
<p>The census data came from the Current Population Survey as of April 2008. The figures for &#8220;white&#8221; refer to those who are not of Hispanic ethnicity. {snip}<br/>

			<p>The key word here is &#8220;claims.&#8221;  Has any of this alleged discrimination been proven, or are the lower salaries justified by performance issues?</p>

			<p>Surprise!  Surprise!  Now why don&rsquo;t you give us the salaries by race for the NBA, NFL and MLB, where you excel by jumping higher, running faster and longer.  I suspect that you will find no only approximately 80% black population but singnificantly higher pay for the blacks.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t specify but I suspect the &#8216;higher paying jobs&rsquo; you are developing statistics for are jobs where excellence is strongly correlated with intellect.  The last I heard intellectual prowess is strongly related to IQ, whites in US (Mean=102), Hispanics in US (Mean=90) and Blacks in US (Mean=85), all approximate.  With &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; abounding, receiving a degree may be misleading relative to intellectual capability. So, suprise, suprise that the more capable individuals rise on the corporate ladder and are paid more!</p>

<p>The mass media loves to pretend that a degree is a degree, so any income disparity between college educated blacks and college educated whites must be due to Evil White Racists (TM).  In real life of course a white person&rsquo;s degree in Electrical Engineering is likely to be somewhat more valuable than a black person&rsquo;s degree in media studies.  Check out who&rsquo;s attending the hard science and engineering courses   &mdash;   lots of whites and Asians, very few Hispanics, and almost no blacks.  (I&rsquo;ll bet that whatever income disparity there is between college educated whites and college educated native born Asians is in favor of the Asians   &mdash;   but the mass media will never mention that, or see it as a problem that needs to be solved.)</p>

			<p>For the most part, no one really likes being around someone of another ethnicity for any extended period of time. Admit it. <br/>
(I didn&rsquo;t say I dislike them. It&rsquo;s just not natural or the way I&rsquo;d choose to live my life. It&rsquo;s different cultural upbringings that don&rsquo;t go away.)I don&rsquo;t even like being around plenty of my own ethnicity for any extended period of time. It all starts at home. </p>

<p>People with markedly lower IQs earn less than people with higher IQs.</p>
<p>We have to stamp out intelligencism!</p>

			<p>Hi 9mmMax.</p>
<p>Your figures are close as far as Whites go, but further apart for Blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>With renorming, US White IQ is now ~102. This is because formerly 100 = US White IQ and now 100 = US Overall IQ. The renorming doesn&rsquo;t really change anything, and the differences are just as great afterward. But if we bump Whites up 2 pts, we need to bump everyone else up too. </p>
<p>So it should look like this.</p>
<p>US Whites = 102<br/>
US Hispanics = 92<br/>
US Blacks = 88.5* or 87</p>
<p>*I give Blacks a 13.5 pt differential as opposed to 15 pt differential.</p>

			<p>The problem is, relatively few blacks can become doctors, engineers, accountants, or lawyers.  The few that are capable of making it through school and becoming certified have many opportunities for entry and advancement, and have an edge over even better qualified whites. But the inherent complexity of the work guarantees that blacks will remain underrepresented in those fields.    </p>

<p>Have you ever noticed that when people move in together ( 2 cousins sharing an apartment for example) they start to gradually get on each others nerves. It is hard enough for me to not be irritated by white people sometimes, so if I have to spend long periods of time with blacks my head just wants to explode. It is not a matter of hatred it is a simple fact of human nature. Humans are extremely diversified.</p>

			<p>Its quite simple really. Business is a game and money is how you keep score. Companies will pay more money to recruit and retain high achievers. This makes them more money and they win.</p>
<p>Companies will pay less money to recruit and retain low achievers. I&rsquo;m not talking about people with college degrees. I&rsquo;m talking about people who actually produce on the job.</p>
<p>In order to increase the &#8216;bottom line&rsquo;, companies will relocate factories to foreign countries, hire illegal aliens and polute the environment if they can get away with it. You will never convince me that they will not hire Blacks if it would increase their bottom line. That&rsquo;s just ludicrous. The NBA is proof of that. The NBA just wants the best producers. If the best producers happen to be Black then so be it.</p>

<p>Guess we&rsquo;ll just have to double the number of layabouts lounging about government offices to accomodate all these black college graduates whether they can read at a functional 4th grade level or an illiterate 1st grade level.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before.  It&rsquo;s worth posting again.  In I think 1966 or 67 my Dad&rsquo;s employer sent him to a week long conference in Detroit.  The subject of the conference was: How affirmative action will affect manufacturers.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the conference was:  From now on, every hiring, firing, transfer, promotion and assignment decision made by every level of management from foreman to CEO is subject to litigation.</p>
<p>That conclusion from 45 years ago says it all.</p>
