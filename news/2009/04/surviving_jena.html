			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mychal Bell, Global Grind, April 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>My name is Mychal Bell and I was one of the Jena Six that was charged with attempted murder down in Jena, Louisiana in 2006. As of now, seeing that we have a black president, and with the anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. tomorrow, I wanted to share with you my dream like Dr. King shared his dream with everybody. I even had the chance, although I was in shackles and handcuffs, to meet Martin Luther King III, when he came to visit me in prison. So, I feel like I have a connection to the King family.</p>
<p>When I look back at the day that I got in a fight with Justin Barker at my high school, I now realize that I should have done what Dr. King preached, which was non-violence. A few months before the fight, I remember seeing nooses hung from a tree at my school, and none of the few black students knew who was responsible. But, what came to my mind was images of Mississippi burning, seeing how black people were hung and killed, and it felt very disrespectful. In the small town that I grew up in, I had always felt that black people and white people didn&rsquo;t get along. After all, this was Louisiana.</p>
<p>When I first entered prison, I was young, only 16, and I had been charged as an adult with attempted murder for the fight. The kids who put up the noose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing happened to them. Being in prison, I could only see my parents once a week and it was really hard to get by. But, being in prison, it helped me become a better man in life and become stronger and realize my dreams. I spent over a year in prison, before I took a plea bargain in juvenile court for a simple battery and was given time served and sent home. Since that time, my life hasn&rsquo;t been easy&hellip;a lot of people talk bad about me and the media has portrayed me as someone who I am not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know the truth about who I am and I know I am not a bad person. The media pushed me to a point where I tried to kill myself, which I didn&rsquo;t want to do, but that incident has made me a stronger person, and now I can finally see my dream in front of me. On May 13th I will graduate from high school and in the fall I will attend a four-year university on a football scholarship. As me being a young black man I know that Dr. King died for me, so I can be in the position that I am, to become anything I want in life.<br>

<i>&#8220;A few months before the fight, I remember seeing nooses hung from a tree at my school, and none of the few black students knew who was responsible.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>From what I read about the nooses, they were quickly removed before students saw them. Does anyone else remember this? Can anyone track this down? Can anyone find a link where Mr. Bell previously stated that seeing these nooses caused him to recall racial injustices of the past? This sounds like a reconstructed false memory.</p>
<p>Go to the link and read the comments of people giving their gushing love and support for another &#8216;civil rights hero&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;When I look back at the day that I got in a fight with Justin Barker&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>YOU did not get into a fight with Justin Barker, bell, you attempted to kill him, in fact you had four prior convictions for crimes of violence. </p>
<p>Here is the REAL story, from Pat Buchanan, that we&rsquo;ll never read in the msm because they gave YOU a pass, as they do with all black-on-White crimes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Two days later came the &#8216;schoolyard fight.&rsquo; Only this was no fight. Black students barricaded an exit to the gym and lay in wait for Justin Barker. As Barker went for another exit, he was struck in the head from behind by Mychal Bell. Multiple witnesses say Barker fell unconscious as a gang of eight or 10 blacks stomped and kicked him in the head. The assistant principal who reached Barker thought he was dead. Barker&rsquo;s emergency room bill ran to more than $5,000&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>You considered this cowardly, vicious ambush a &#8216;fight&rsquo;? After your conviction was overturned you: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;pled guilty in December to hitting Barker from behind, slamming his head into a concrete beam and kicking him in the head&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>YOU were given another pass, spent 18 months in juvenile detention and agreed to testify against your co-conspirator. How did the black community feel about you &#8216;snitching&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8221;..The kids who put up the noose &hellip; nothing happened to them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, that is your justification for the attempted murder of a White  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s a lie:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When school officials confronted them, all were remorseful&hellip;Far from being let off, they spent &#8216;nine days at an alternative facility, followed by two weeks of in-school suspension, Saturday detentions, attendance at Discipline Court and evaluations by licensed mental-health professionals&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I will attend a four-year university on a football scholarship&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If anyone knows which university this is, please post it so the alumni associations (you know, the ones that donate money) can be made aware, that is unless it&rsquo;s an HBCU.</p>

<p>The media has portrayed you with far more generosity and respect than you deserve, you amoral moron. </p>
<p>Please note that this entire exercise in self-exculpation is nothing but &#8220;me, me, me, Dr. King, Dr. King, Dr. King&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Only ONE mention of Justin Barker   &mdash;   whom, to hear Mychal tell it, he &#8220;got into a fight with.&#8221; No, Mychal, you didn&rsquo;t &#8220;get into a fight with&#8221; Justin, you ambushed him and   &mdash;   with the help of your FIVE homies   &mdash;   the six of you proceeded to smash in his face and send him to the Emergency Room. </p>
<p>Try to remember that when Pres. Obama is presenting you with your inevitable Presidential Medal of Honor a few years down the road. </p>

			<p>That has got to be the most nauseating thing that I have ever read. This guy participated in a beating of a young man who was thought to be dead when the ambulance came to get him. 6 on one is not a &#8220;fight&#8221;, it is a deliberate beat down. He nowhere in this piece says that he was sorry for beating an innocent boy nearly to death. It supposedly upset him so badly by seeing a piece of rope twisted in a noose that he beat a kid that had nothing to do with the supposed &#8220;crime&#8221; All he cares about is Mychal Bell. </p>

<p>Also, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the &#8220;better man&#8221; lessons he learned in jail (not prison, because only convicted adult felons to go prisons) took, as he has been in the trouble with the law at least once since then.</p>
<p><i>he kids who put up the noose &hellip; nothing happened to them.</i></p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not getting football scholarships, nor did they have the sympathy of civil rights leaders and hustlers.</p>

			<p>The kid is an outright liar.  First of all, his violent gang assault of Justin Barker had nothing to do with the fact that other kids had hung nooses on a tree.  Second, he, nor any other students saw the &#8220;nooses&#8221; that were hung, as they were removed by an administrator at the school before school started.  This violent young offender will be back in prison sooner rather than later, that I can guarantee.</p>

			<p>Well well, attempt to kill a lone student, while surrounded and helped in said assualt by 5 of your best buds, and after a little inconvenience you can go to college on a full football scholorship! Acknowledge that, &#8220;As me being a young black man I know that Dr. King died for me, so I can be in the position that I am, to become anything I want in life.&#8221; and all is forgiven. (I thought Jesus died for us, but I guess that&rsquo;s only white folks, the blacks have Dr. King&hellip;)This young thug should still be in prison, not getting a free scholorship.</p>

			<p>Has the defination of &#8220;fight&#8221; been changed? Last time I looked, a fight consisted of parties on two sides exchanging blows. What Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 participated in was not a fight. It was an outright assualt with intent to kill upon Justin Barker.</p>

			<p>Someone ghosted this for Bell, the youtube videos of him being interviewed are very revealing, he speaks a horrible form of unintelligible English and can barely be understood. I doubt that he can read and write above the third grade level. His time in college will be interesting to watch.</p>

			<p>There is reason to doubt the existence of this football scholarship.  If indeed it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s probably at a tiny black college somewhere.  I can&rsquo;t imagine a head coach or athletic director wanting this guy around.  </p>

			<p>If I were to go to the trouble of tracking down the e-mail contacts of all the Republican state representatives in Louisiana (ie White state reps) would some activists here agree to write personal introduction letters to them and then include Jared Taylor&rsquo;s the Jena 6 Fraud?</p>
<p>I have found that it does work to make personal contact with officials and present to them the truth in the right way and sending out well written Jared Tyalor articles always comes off in a good way.</p>

<p>I also noticed this. And I notice that the anti White cultural Marxist repeatedly do this - try to make &#8220;gods&#8221;, &#8220;Saints&#8221; out of anti White figures. America is supposed to worship Martin Luther King, the Kennedys and the 1960s as some holy time, immortals, the Civil Rights movement as the religious, defining spiritual movement in American history, there was supposedly no history before this morality conflict between good and evil and anyone who suggests that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t so cut and dried good and evil and maybe MLK wasn&rsquo;t a God, saint or even a &#8220;Dr.&#8221; (He plagiarized his doctoral thesis) - these bad people are evil sinners that need to be &#8220;saved&#8221; or shunned.</p>

			<p>I believe the sincerity of this as much as I believe that Mychal wrote this himself. Assuming that he actually saw the nooses in the few minutes before they were removed, which I seriously doubut, his first thought was the metaphorical comparison to Mississippi burning and those that had gone before? </p>
<p>Forget the football scholarship, let&rsquo;s get this guy a literary fellowship!</p>

<p>That was my first thought, after reading just a few sentences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s juvenile and not very good, but obviously it&rsquo;s far better than what he could do himself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of a near-moron, who has already committed crimes of attempted murder, robbery and shop lifting, plus others not mentioned because he was a juvenile, showing every promise of committing more of the same&hellip;.and probably worse&hellip;.. with each passing day.  </p>
<p>Because of his natural black arrogance, he probably thinks his juvenile attempts at sounding like Mr. Nice Guy is going to fool everybody into believing his utmost desire is to be everybody&rsquo;s idea of the perfect citizen.</p>
<p>He comes across as a total fool.  <br>

			<p>The good news is that since Bell is not one bit sorry - as evidenced by his description of this cowardly pack-assault as a &#8220;fight&#8221;, he&rsquo;ll be in serious trouble again before long.  </p>
<p>When I was in prison, and in the years since my release, it was very easy to tell which inmates would be going back and who would actually manage a successful fresh start.  Bell&rsquo;s one of the former.  He testified against a co-defendant, now downplays the whole attack, and appears to imagine that by simply repeating some happy-sounding platitudes about a womanizing Marxist being a messianic &#8220;savior&#8221; who &#8220;died for him&#8221; that he can be mistaken for a useful citizen.  This chamelionesque attempt at transformation could best be described as &#8220;sympathetic magic&#8221;.  By an absolutely amazing coincidence, we all know exactly who tends to believe in magic in the United States.</p>
<p>The &#8220;leaders&#8221; in black store-front churches must be salivating already; they have the makings of a true religious hypocrite in Bell: God&rsquo;s man on Sundays and the Devil&rsquo;s the other six.</p>

			<p>Why must so many Blacks hang on to MLK for all the inspiration in their sad lives? How about taking responsibility for your own life and your own actions for once? </p>
<p>The young man who allegedly wrote this article has nothing in common with MLK other than the color of his skin and a culture of victim hood that continues to oppress the very people that it purports to uplift.</p>

			<p>Every American should read this account by prosecutor Reed Walters, and it should be compulsory for every school in the US:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/opinion/26walters.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=jena%20prosecutor&amp;st=cse" rel="nofollow">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/opinion/26walters.html?_r=1&scp;=1&sq;=jena%20prosecutor&st;=cse</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the term &#8220;scoolyard fight&#8221; was given &#8220;official&#8221; sanction when used in speeches by candidate Obama.</p>
<p>Bell had commited a string of violent crimes by his mid-teens, his premeditated murder attempot of J Barker was as predictable as a sunrise.</p>
<p>Blacks are spectacularly violent by nature, and we are not doing them any favors by pretending otherwise. </p>

			<p>Someone please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but, weren&rsquo;t the &#8216;nooses&rsquo; painted with school colors during homecoming week? Wasn&rsquo;t the homecoming theme &#8216;hang &#8216;em high&rsquo; because the opposing football team&rsquo;s name was the &#8216;Cowboys&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Yes, someone please find out which college this waste is going to. </p>

			<p>Welcome to the USA. If you belong to the right victim group, you can act on your hatred for Whites, Christians or Jews, and win fame and fortune!</p>
<p>Al Sharpton - inciting to violence. Destroying innocent men&rsquo;s lives by perpetrating a deliberate lie. Celebrated by the democrat party.</p>
<p>9/11 hijackers - dead but famous. If they were still alive, they would just now be coming up for trial in the &#8220;trial of the century.&#8221; Their fellow religionists are now honorary members of the second most important victim group.</p>
<p>This thug - beat up and try to kill a White boy, become famous, have the best lawyers vying to defend you at no cost, give interviews, become &#8220;rehabilitated,&#8221; get free entrance to the college of your choice, be guaranteed to graduate without knowing anything, and one day rise up in the ranks of the democrat party.<br>

			<p>Here is my conservative prediction on this young victim of racist oppression`s future. He will go to some state college where he will be treated like a god. He will be given tutors, strenght coaches, under the table running around money, and the answers to those pesky tests.<br>
     Along the spring semester of his second year, and while sporting a brisk 1.6 grade average, he will be arrested for throwing his pregnant white girl friend down the stairs of his off campus apartment. He will get off but be injured and have his scholarship lifted. About 1 year later he will be shot robbing a liquor store or busted selling a pound of reefer or an eight ball of crack.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I even had the chance, although I was in shackles and handcuffs, to meet Martin Luther King III, when he came to visit me in prison. So, I feel like I have a connection to the King family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course you do.  And that connection extends to all blacks, including Jesse and Al who tried to get you off.</p>
<p>If this case isn&rsquo;t proof positive that almost every black in this country shares the same opinions and hatreds of Jeremiah Wright and his congregation against whites I just don&rsquo;t know what would.</p>
<p>And for those disgusting whites who donated money to this primitive, I hope they will learn someday, up close and personal, what it is like to be mobbed by cowardly blacks and beaten for no other reason than they are white.<br>

			<p>Hey, Mychal, did you have someone read all these comments to you?<br>
Good.  Now you know how real human beings feel about you.<br>
You are a loser, a criminal, and a coward.  You still have not realized the mistakes you made, so will continue to make mistakes.  I will give you a new word to learn: RESPONSIBILITY.<br>
Lotsa luck with that.</p>

			<p>I also remember a picture that was posted here on Amren of a gloating Mychal Bell with his mouth stuffed full of money, donations from gullable liberals and other blacks who gave donations for his &#8220;legal defense fund&#8221;. Most of the other parents who recieved donations bought expensive cars and other luxury items with money that was supposed to be for lawyers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When I first entered prison, I was young, only 16, and I had been charged as an adult with attempted murder for the fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, you were charged with attempted murder because you attempted to murder someone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kids who put up the noose &hellip; nothing happened to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because they only put up a noose, which is, you-know, not really doing anything.  You however, young master Bell, ganged up with five other guys to stomp someone to death.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, being in prison, it helped me become a better man in life and become stronger and realize my dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>So many young black men seem to think that being in jail or prison is a useful formative experience - that&rsquo;s one of their problems.  Being in jail didn&rsquo;t help him become a better man - it just temporarily insulated the citizens of his home town from the danger he poses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with many others on this post - look for his mug-shots to appear soon on &#8220;The Smoking Gun&#8221; for robbery or assault.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;nooses&#8221; were hung up as a school rivalry prank, NOT as a &#8220;racial&#8221; taunt.  The &#8220;nooses&#8221; were in the &#8220;school colors&#8221; of the school that the visiting team was playing.  Of course, this &#8220;fact&#8221; was conveniently left out by the &#8220;main stream media&#8221;.<br>
It seems that the main stream media could be brought up on charges of inciting a riot.</p>

			<p>The same reward of a &#8220;college scholarship&#8221; almost happened to the Michigan thug, nathaniel abraham.  nathaniel abraham was a career criminal (juvenile delinquent) that killed a man outside a party store for the &#8220;h#ll of it.  He was given a &#8220;blended sentence&#8221; by a bleeding heart &#8220;judge&#8221;.  Upon his release from the juvenile facility, he resumed his criminal career and is now doing &#8220;hard time&#8221; in a adult facility.<br>
Fortunately, the good citizens of Michigan got wind of the &#8220;free ride&#8221; that this &#8220;upstanding member of society?&#8221; was going to get and put a quick stop to it.  Justice prevails (sometimes).</p>

Here&rsquo;s a short interview with Mr. Bell from youtube.</p>
<p>If Mr. Bell wrote the above article, I have to believe it was heavily edited.</p>
<p>Read the comments. Most of the people who posted replies know the score. Few people are fooled. The rest are apologists, delusional, or both:</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Someone please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but, weren&rsquo;t the &lsquo;nooses&rsquo; painted with school colors during homecoming week?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Anon</p>
<p>For the record, again from Pat Buchanan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Franklin says they were a joke aimed at White friends on the rodeo team. As they were painted in Jena High&rsquo;s gold and black, Allen reports that the kids said the nooses were directed at a rival school&rsquo;s Western-themed football team. When school officials confronted them, all were remorseful&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>From Spartan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;donations bought expensive cars and other luxury items with money that was supposed to be for lawyers&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>About $500,000 was raised.  Its whereabouts, unknown  &mdash;  however:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Bell&rsquo;s mom is said to be driving a new Jaguar, and Bailey&rsquo;s mom a new Beamer. Two other Jena Sixers&hellip;appeared in rapper attire on Black Entertainment Television as presenters of a Hip-Hop Award. </p>
<p>Also from Anon:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;You still have not realized the mistakes you made, so will continue to make mistakes&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 <br>
To cretins such as bell, this was no mistake, and I doubt he feels any remorse  &mdash;  remorse requires higher thinking, courage, self-reflection, an ability to accept blame, humbling one&rsquo;s self and empathy toward others  &mdash;  a trait not found in those populations marked by low IQs, violence and impulses they cannot control.</p>
<p>And, as further proof that Western Civilization is on its last gasp, bell had plenty of support for his aberrant behavior and murderous intentions towards Whites from the msm, race activists in the black community, and the usual hostile elites including White celebrities.  Same thing in the Duke non-rape case.  </p>
<p>This is about severely punishing and destroying Whites  &mdash;  but not before their wealth is confiscated, of course.</p>
<p>Is anyone coming to Justin Baker&rsquo;s defense?  Are any organizations out there helping him to seek justice?  Nah, he&rsquo;s White and expendable.</p>

			<p>What a joke! What a liar!  Black folks don&rsquo;t have anything against gang raping black women and terrorizing little black children with nooses.  They just want to keep all the fun to themselves.   </p>
<p>Go here (https://tinyurl.com/cxht3c) and look at the picture of the black (!) teacher a few miles up the road from Jena sticking a poor terrified little black child&rsquo;s head into a noose. Big ol&rsquo; grin on her face!  Turns out she wanted to terrify the children so they would know what it felt like to be in fear of white folks and a noose.  Where I come from that is called terrorism and &#8220;teaching hate&#8221;. </p>
<p>Go here (https://tinyurl.com/dgmako) and read about Al Sharpton and the NAACP fighting to get four out of 10+ young black male rapists and torturers out on bail.  Al and the NAACP say it is racist to keep them in jail for gang-raping a black women for hours, forcing her to sex her 12 year old son, blinding him with chemicals and then trying to light both of them on fire. </p>
<p>They are truly sick as a culture that they like to do this to their children and young women and then have the gall to blame it on white folks.</p>

David Bowie gave something like 5k to his defence. I don&rsquo;t think I will ever be able to listen to him again.</p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 3:25 AM on April 7 </p>
<p><br>
It was $10K. Twice as bad. But considering how rich Bowie is, it could have been worse. </p>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll never listen to Bowie again   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve been listening to him for 35 years   &mdash;   I certainly won&rsquo;t be buying any more Bowie product, ever. He&rsquo;s had the last dollar he&rsquo;ll ever get out of me. </p>
<p>What I wonder if how much influence Bowie&rsquo;s black wife Iman had on that donation. </p>

			<p>Why are young black men so eager to claim they have been in &#8220;prison?&#8221; Mychal Bell has never been in prison. He was in the county&hellip; er, parish&hellip; jail. That&rsquo;s where people go while awaiting trial. Prison is that big farm down at Angola where men go after they&rsquo;ve been convicted. Mychal escaped prison by plea bargaining.</p>

			<p>Expect another outcry of support when he starts victimizing students at his new school.  This guy is the new OJ Simpson - except like blacks in general of this generation, he got started earlier, never accomplished anything, and has made no effort to keep his nose clean since the initial incident.</p>
