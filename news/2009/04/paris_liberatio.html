<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7984436.stm">Paris Liberation Made &#8216;Whites Only&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Thomson, BBC News, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Papers unearthed by the BBC reveal that British and American commanders ensured that the liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944 was seen as a &#8220;whites only&#8221; victory.</p>
<p>Many who fought Nazi Germany during World War II did so to defeat the vicious racism that left millions of Jews dead.</p>
<p>Yet the BBC&rsquo;s Document programme has seen evidence that black colonial soldiers  &mdash;  who made up around two-thirds of Free French forces  &mdash;  were deliberately removed from the unit that led the Allied advance into the French capital.</p>
<p>By the time France fell in June 1940, 17,000 of its black, mainly West African colonial troops, known as the Tirailleurs Senegalais, lay dead.</p>
<p>Many of them were simply shot where they stood soon after surrendering to German troops who often regarded them as sub-human savages.</p>
<p>Their chance for revenge came in August 1944 as Allied troops prepared to retake Paris. But despite their overwhelming numbers, they were not to get it.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;More desirable&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The leader of the Free French forces, Charles de Gaulle, made it clear that he wanted his Frenchmen to lead the liberation of Paris.</p>
<p>Allied High Command agreed, but only on one condition: De Gaulle&rsquo;s division must not contain any black soldiers.</p>
<p>In January 1944 Eisenhower&rsquo;s Chief of Staff, Major General Walter Bedell Smith, was to write in a memo stamped, &#8220;confidential&#8221;: &#8220;It is more desirable that the division mentioned above consist of white personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would indicate the Second Armoured Division, which with only one fourth native personnel, is the only French division operationally available that could be made one hundred percent white.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time America segregated its own troops along racial lines and did not allow black GIs to fight alongside their white comrades until the late stages of the war.</p>
<p><b>Morocco division</b></p>
<p>Given the fact that Britain did not segregate its forces and had a large and valued Indian army, one might have expected London to object to such a racist policy.</p>
<p>Yet this does not appear to have been the case.</p>
<p>A document written by the British General, Frederick Morgan, to Allied Supreme Command stated: &#8220;It is unfortunate that the only French formation that is 100% white is an armoured division in Morocco.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every other French division is only about 40% white. I have told Colonel de Chevene that his chances of getting what he wants will be vastly improved if he can produce a white infantry division.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finding an all-white division that was available proved to be impossible due to the enormous contribution made to the French Army by West African conscripts.</p>
<p>So, Allied Command insisted that all black soldiers be taken out and replaced by white ones from other units.</p>
<p>When it became clear that there were not enough white soldiers to fill the gaps, soldiers from parts of North Africa and the Middle East were used instead.</p>
<p><b>Pensions cut</b></p>
<p>In the end, nearly everyone was happy. De Gaulle got his wish to have a French division lead the liberation of Paris, even though the shortage of white troops meant that many of his men were actually Spanish.</p>
<p>The British and Americans got their &#8220;Whites Only&#8221; Liberation even though many of the troops involved were North African or Syrian.</p>
<p>For France&rsquo;s West African Tirailleurs Senegalais, however, there was little to celebrate.</p>
<p>Despite forming 65% of Free French Forces and dying in large numbers for France, they were to have no heroes&rsquo; welcome in Paris.</p>
<p>After the liberation of the French capital many were simply stripped of their uniforms and sent home. To make matters even worse, in 1959 their pensions were frozen.</p>
<p>Former French colonial soldier, Issa Cisse from Senegal, who is now 87 years-old, looks back on it all with sadness and evident resentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, the Senegalese, were commanded by the white French chiefs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were colonised by the French. We were forced to go to war. Forced to follow the orders that said, do this, do that, and we did. France has not been grateful. Not at all.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t comment on the veracity of this story, but if it true I strongly suspect that Allied commanders were far more concerned about gross midbehavior (including rape and looting) of the black Sengalese troops than they were about who allegedly &#8220;liberated&#8221; Paris.  </p>

			<p>Where were all the Senegalese (black?) soldiers at?? I have more than a small library and I have never seen black Senegalese in any of them. Not saying they didn&rsquo;t exist, but I wonder at the quoted numbers.</p>

<p>Oh, so after all this time, some revealing papers have been  &#8220;unearthed&#8221; giving us a new view on history!!  Well, well.</p>
<p>Could this timely discovery possibly have anything to do with Obama&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency? And his visit to Europe?  Are we to expect a string of more revelations over the next four years? </p>
<p>Just more revisionism, that&rsquo;s all.   We in the USA are well aware that &#8220;Blacks built America&#8221; and this country couldn&rsquo;t function without them; but now France is about to learn that blacks won the 2nd World War and liberated them from those wicked Germans who were raping and plundering the country.</p>
<p>More startling discoveries to come.  Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>France depended on Vietnames and African troops for years to project an imperial army its own population never could have supported. I would understand white troops leading the French contingent into Paris. Continetal France, at least in 1944, was white. But those who fought to liberate France should have been in the liberation parade. France covered up a lot-including its greater than average collaboration with the Nazis. DeGaulle was a great man. But he was also great at projection of image. The truth is that most French males didn&rsquo;t fight in the resistance or in the Free French forces. Many served Vichy. Many did nothing(and I don&rsquo;t condemn or judge those.).  Every African who fought for France and was in France that day should have marched under the Arch of Triumph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against the destruction of American and European civilization as anyone. I&rsquo;m against affirmative action. Our literature and culture, our intelligence and contribution to industry, is peerless and superior by far to Africa. But a man fights for a country and survives- he should be honored. Too many posters here are letting racial disdain get in the way of honoring what simple soldiers did.  Would that most blacks had the courage of the Asian and African soldiers of France in WWII.</p>
<p>In addition, many Algerians and Moroccans also honorably fought for France. France&rsquo;s stupid reluctance to honor them led in part to the bloody Algerian War, in which France got its head properly handed to it.</p>
<p>Treat soldiers right.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Germans shot blacks on sight, from what I have read, Germans were superior to the allies in their tendancies towards gentlemanly war conduct &hellip;.. by far!<br>
Some say that Germany may have won the war if they had been as vicious as the bolsheviks . <br>
I have read that blacks raped tens of thousand along with the red invaders to conquer Germany in order to &#8220;break the German spirit&#8221; as it was said.</p>
<p>The internet has much revelation on the second world war and all sorts of misconduct .  This article wreaks of tired old black victim - bad whitey  garbage. </p>

<p> Sounds too many to me. The 2nd armored division was the first &#8220;french&#8221; unit entering Paris. It had a good number of spanish republicans that had fought since norway for the french army.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Armored_Division_(France)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Armored_Division_(France)</a></p>
<p> I heard also the many of the &#8220;resistance&#8221; in south france was made by former spanish republicans. They were experienced from 3 years of war and had nothing to loose as the germans or the Vichy colaboracionist will give them to Franco.</p>

			<p>&#8220;To make matters even worse, in 1959 their pensions were frozen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governement of the newly independant african countries asked for this, arguing those pension were vastly disproportionated compared to the typical revenue amongst their compatriots.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;We, the Senegalese, were commanded by the white French chiefs,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Yes, french officier led them in combat to victory, while suffering more casualties than any other troops&rsquo;s officiers during the war.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;We were colonised by the French. We were forced to go to war. Forced to follow the orders that said, do this, do that, and we did. France has not been grateful. Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, most of the african soldiers were volonteers and their salary much higher than what they could have earned at home.</p>

			<p>My late alcoholic and beloved uncle John wasa motor cycle dispatch rider during the fight for North Africa. He and about 15 other riders who by the campaigns end had dwindled down to 6, were billeted next to the Free French .He told of African troops who would sleep all day but leave at night armed only with a curved, razor sharp, knife. They we be back by sun up and were hardley ever seen.<br>
     He was dragooned into helping Mps escort captured Italian troops to the pow assembly point. When these piasanos saw an African soldier heading to the latrine they freaked and started praying and screaming. He almost had to shoot a couple to get them to keep marching.<br>
     The Italians had the undisciplined habit of sleeping on guard and not having at least one man awake in their foxholes and dug outs. These &#8221; Goons &#8221; as they were known would cut the throats of everybody in a fox hole except one sleeper. This had a deliterious on Italian morale. They would also bring back blue eyes as they thought blue eyes were good for sexual vitality. That is why the Germans shot them on sight. They out SSed the SS.<br>
     The Allies might not have been racist just terrified that some of these fellows would start cutting throats and gouging eyes before the movie camaras  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll let others deal with any factual errors in the article. What I find of greater importance is its anti-White attitude. This article doesn&rsquo;t simply point out the contributions of the Senegalese and other Blacks; it vilifies White leaders. The implicit message of the article: White men always have been evil Racists, and have to be controlled to prevent damage to normal humanity.</p>

			<p>Currently, what percentage of France and Germany is white? I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I haven&rsquo;t been there and those countries don&rsquo;t take straight-forward racial statistics. In those countries is the non-White TFR significantly higher than the White TFR?</p>

			<p>Since the liberal mainstream media is well known for it&rsquo;s anti-white biased manipulations, then pretty much anything I read like this article only makes me think that even if any of this is true, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the damage that blacks have done to white society. <br>
