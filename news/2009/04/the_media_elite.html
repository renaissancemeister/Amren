<p><b>Boosting Obama</b></p>
<p>The networks have given President Obama more coverage than George W. Bush and Bill Clinton combined in their first months  &mdash;  and more positive assessments to boot.</p>
<p>In a study to be released today, the Center for Media and Public Affairs and Chapman University found the nightly newscasts devoting nearly 28 hours to Obama&rsquo;s presidency in the first 50 days. (Bush, by contrast, got nearly eight hours.) Fifty-eight percent of the Obama evaluations were positive on the ABC, CBS and NBC broadcasts, compared with 33 percent positive in the comparable period of Bush&rsquo;s tenure and 44 percent positive for Clinton. (Evaluations by officials from the administration or political parties were not counted.)</p>
<p>On Fox News, by contrast, only 13 percent of the assessments of Obama were positive on the first half of Bret Baier&rsquo;s &#8220;Special Report,&#8221; which most resembles a newscast. The president got far better treatment in the New York Times, where 73 percent of the assessments in front-page pieces were positive.</p>
<p>A striking contrast: Obama&rsquo;s personal qualities drew more favorable coverage than his policies, with 32 percent of the sound bites positive on CBS, 31 percent positive on NBC and 8 percent positive on Fox.</p>

								<h2>Media Boost Obama, Bash His Policies</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Press Release, Center for Media and Public Affairs, April 27, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Study Finds President Fares Best in New York Times, Worst on Fox News</p>
<p>He Attracts More Early Coverage Than G.W. Bush and Bill Clinton Combined<br>
Contact: Donald Rieck</p>
<p>The media have given President Obama more coverage than George W. Bush and Bill Clinton combined and more positive coverage than either received at this point in their presidencies, according to a new study by researchers at George Mason and Chapman Universities. But the study also finds that Mr. Obama&rsquo;s positive media image hasn&rsquo;t precluded heavy criticism of his policies.</p>
<p>This research was conducted jointly by researchers at George Mason University in Fairfax VA and Chapman University in Orange CA, and coordinated by the Center for Media and Public Affairs (CMPA). It covers all news about Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency that appeared on the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox evening newscasts (the first half hour of Fox News Channel&rsquo;s &#8220;Special Report&#8221;) as well as front page stories in the New York Times, during the first 50 days of his term in office (January 20 through March 10). We examined all evaluations made by reporters and non-partisan sources, i.e., those not affiliated with either political party. For additional information on our methodology see https://cmpa.com/about_methods.htm</p>
<p>During his first 50 days in office, the three broadcast network evening news shows devoted 1021 stories lasting 27 hours 44 minutes to Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency. The daily average of seven stories and over 11 minutes of airtime represents about half of the entire newscasts. By contrast, at this point in their presidencies George W. Bush had received 7 hours 42 minutes and Bill Clinton garnered 15 hours 2 minutes of coverage, for a combined total airtime five hours less than Mr. Obama&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The networks varied in their attention to the Obama administration. CBS led the coverage with 365 stories and 10 hours 46 minutes of airtime, followed by NBC with 327 stories and 9 hours 38 minutes, and ABC with 329 stories and 7 hours 20 minutes. Thus, CBS has given more coverage to the Obama administration than all three networks combined gave to the first 50 days of George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>In addition, the first half hour of Fox News &#8220;Special Report&#8221; (which most closely resembles the broadcast network newscasts) devoted 10 hours 24 minutes to the Obama administration, nearly as much airtime as CBS gave him. And the New York Times devoted 115 front-page stories running 3385 column inches, the equivalent of over 28 full pages of text, to the Obama presidency.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has received not only more press but also better press than his immediate predecessors. On the ABC, CBS, and NBC evening news, fifty-eight percent of all evaluations of the president and his policies have been favorable, and 42 percent were unfavorable. CMPA&rsquo;s previous studies of network news found that George W. Bush received only 33 percent positive evaluations by sources and reporters during the first 50 days of his administration in 2001, and Bill Clinton received only 44 percent positive evaluations during his first ten weeks (70 days) in office in 1993. (As noted above, these figures are based on judgments by reporters and sources not affiliated with either political party.)</p>
<p>The three networks have evaluated Mr. Obama very similarly  &mdash;  57% positive comments on ABC, 58% positive on CBS, and 61% positive on NBC. But he fared far better in New York Times stories, where nearly three out of four evaluative comments (73%) by sources and reporters were favorable. And he fared far worse on Fox News, where only one out of eight such comments (13%) were favorable. Examples:</p>
<p>Positive Example: &#8220;I was blown away by President Obama&rsquo;s grasp of the subject. How he connected the dots. How he answered the questions without any script.&#8221;   &mdash;  George Stephanopoulos, ABC, March 5</p>
<p>Positive Example: &#8220;President Obama has done more in one week to reduce oil dependence and global warming than George Bush did in eight years.&#8221;   &mdash;  Environmentalist, New York Times, Jan. 26</p>
<p>Negative Example: &#8220;The [employment] numbers the Obama administration is throwing around are absolutely inaccurate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a gross exaggeration.&#8221;   &mdash;  Economist, Fox, Feb. 20</p>
<p>While Mr. Obama&rsquo;s personal qualities and leadership abilities have drawn mostly praise from the mainstream media, his policies have not fared so well. On the broadcast networks fewer than two out of five evaluative soundbites (39%) praised his policies and proposals. ABC&rsquo;s policy coverage was relatively balanced (48% positive), while source and reporter comments ran over two to one negative at both CBS (32% positive) and NBC (31% positive).</p>
<p>TV news coverage of the president&rsquo;s economic policies, which focused mainly on the economic stimulus and the various proposed and enacted industry bailouts, garnered support from only 37% of evaluative soundbites. He fared better on domestic issues other than the economy, where praise for his health care proposals and new stem cell research policy brought balanced coverage overall (50% positive). But only one out of four comments (24%) praised his foreign policy decisions, including the war on terror.</p>
<p>Negative Example: &#8220;The Obama administration is paying too much money to the wrong people.&#8221;   &mdash;  Economist, CBS, March 20</p>
<p>The New York Times policy coverage, while less positive than its personal coverage of Mr. Obama, was about evenly divided between praise and criticism (48% positive). Although similar to the broadcast networks in its treatment of economic policy (40% positive), the Times portrayed other domestic policy areas relatively favorably (60% positive), and its 39% positive coverage of foreign policy domains was still more favorable than the networks&rsquo; 24% positive coverage.</p>
<p>Positive Example: Mr. Obama&rsquo;s actions &#8220;reaffirmed American values and are a ray of light after eight long, dark years.&#8221;   &mdash;  ACLU executive, New York Times, Jan. 22</p>
<p>By contrast, Fox News coverage was even more negative toward Mr. Obama&rsquo;s policies than the Times was positive. Only one out of twelve evaluative soundbites (8%) praised any of the president&rsquo;s policies, including six percent positive judgments on the economic matters, seven percent on other domestic issues, and 17% on foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Negative Example: &#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to spend someone else&rsquo;s money.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s not only irresponsible, it&rsquo;s unethical.&#8221;   &mdash;  President, Peterson Foundation, Fox, February 20</p>
<p>Across all outlets, the ten most frequently debated issues were: 1. Economic stimulus-287 stories; 2. Industry bailouts-114 stories; 3. Budget/deficit-74 stories; 4. Terrorism-64 stories; 5. Healthcare-61 stories; 6. Taxes-45 stories; 7. Economic conditions-38 stories; 8. Afghanistan-31 stories; 9. Defense-16 stories; 10. Iraq-12 stories.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just that they have the same ideology, the media and Obama, for they didn&rsquo;t swoon over Bill Clinton as much.  It&rsquo;s all race.</p>

			<p>The economy is in terrible shape. Recent reports show that the GDP contracted 6% during the third quarter of 2008. That&rsquo;s almost incredible. That&rsquo;s depression, not recession. Just think how the &#8216;media&rsquo; will portray Obama after the economy corrects itself.</p>

If you want proof of how the MSM gives the Obama administration a pass, all you have to do is look at the photo-op fly-over of NYC.</p>
<p>Had this happened under the Bush administration, it would have been headline news with demands that Bush himself step down.</p>
<p>All we got from the media was a few comments from people who were upset. Certainly no outrage was reported. The press made little of this stupid act and there are few serious calls for a full inquiry or disclosure.</p>
<p>President Obama got a pass.<br>

			<p>This &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; concept is questionable in my book.  Fox News and WABC radio somehow don&rsquo;t count as mainstream?  How is that?  </p>

			<p>The organs of the mass media (neocon Fox aside) have finally got a President as left wing as they are.  Even better, he&rsquo;s not a member of the Oppressor Race.  So naturally they&rsquo;re so excited they&rsquo;re practically peeing in their pants.  Obama will tax us into oblivion to give us socialized housing, food, and health care for illegal immigrants.  That&rsquo;s just what the New York Times wants.</p>

			<p>When the media is finally forced to admit that the Emporer Has No Clothes, the subscriptions to TIME and NEWSWEEK will fall faster than Bill Clinton&rsquo;s trousers.  It&rsquo;s not &#8220;just about sex&#8221;;  it&rsquo;s just about time for &#8220;turkey neck&#8221; to do something outrageous.  Has any president ever done something as stupid as giving the Queen of England an electronic toy(made in China, no less!) as a gift representing America??  The only thing more tacky would have been to put a collection of his speeches on it&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Trash will tell.  Keep the faith, gang.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the never-ending, fawning coverage of obama&rsquo;s family&hellip;dog included! The nauseating fuss over his wife has probably taken up more time than Bush ever received.  </p>

			<p>Ah Yes! Tis the age of Obama, and all shall hail him - and his fashion-setting wife, and his fashion setting wife&rsquo;s arms, and his tykes, and their tyke cuteness, and his tiny dog, and its undeniable fuzzy cuteness, and his cool, and his amazing super-calm as he spends your great, great grandchildren&rsquo;s entire income before they earn it, and his impressive muscles in his presidential Hawaiian swimsuit, and his giant intellect delivering overarchingly vague profundities, and his triumphant travels unendingly touring his adoring planet, and of course, his unforgettable televised speeches signifying hope and change, and hopeful change, and occasionally changed hope, each and every night of our lucky sucker lives. </p>

			<p>Its just as bad in England.Anyone would imagine that he was our elected leader(maybe he is )the way that the press and television are prostrating themselves to this mediocrity.To make matters worse when visiting England,the Obamas actually went about stirring up our own blacks,most notably when Michelle visited a school in north London that did not have a single English student.The hysterical response,more befitting the arrival of a rap star was nauseating in the extreme.</p>
