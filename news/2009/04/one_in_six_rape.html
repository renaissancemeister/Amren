			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One in six rapes in Britain were carried out by foreigners last year, police figures have revealed.</p>
<p>Migrant workers and illegal immigrants were responsible for up to a third of all sex attacks in some areas.</p>
<p>Greater London was worst affected, with foreigners charged in connection with a third of rapes.</p>
<p>The figures were revealed following a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Express.</p>
<p>High numbers of non-UK citizens charged with sex attacks were also prevalent in areas with large immigration populations, including Cambridgeshire, Merseyside, Hertfordshire, Avon and Somerset.</p>
<p>Conservative MP David Davies says the figures are evidence of Labour&rsquo;s failure to monitor the immigration system.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We need to make sure that anyone who has convictions for serious offences in their own country is not allowed into Britain.</p>
<p>&#8216;Anyone found guilty of this heinous crime should be given a long prison sentence and then be deported to their country of origin, whatever that country&rsquo;s human rights record.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch UK, said: &#8216;This is the downside of the free movement of people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Latvian serial rapist Viktors Dembovskis, 42, was given three life sentences for raping and murdering 17-year-old Jeshma Raithatha as she walked home from school.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrant Peter Delisser, 36, was twice deported back to his home country of Jamaica, but crept back into Britain to rape and beat a teenager in Bristol.</p>
<p>According to Home Office statistics, more than 11,500 women and 1,000 men were raped in the UK over a 12-month period in 2007-8.</p>
<p>Police say it is difficult to bring foreign rapists to justice due to the large number of migrant workers and illegal immigrants in the country.</p>
<p>An officer said: &#8216;You always have the risk of flight but with an illegal immigrant it is even more difficult because there is no record of them having come into the country in the first place.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>Given the small size of the country, its citizens will understand the dangers of having third worlders in their society faster than we will. The BNP website states this sort of thing everyday.  I believe history will show the reversal of non white invasions will begin with Great Britain.  The BNP will eventually gain wide support and will become a great example fore other nations when it comes to immigration.  Their socialists but they are Europeans after all.</p>

			<p>It seems they are only counting immigrants who have not yet become citizens.  I&rsquo;d imagine most of the other rapes are being committed by naturalized immigrants and their first and second generation progeny.</p>
<p>I grew up in an extremely &#8216;diverse&rsquo; community. Rich Delta farmland attracted people from all over Europe and the Middle East. Even after several generations as &#8216;Americans&rsquo;, people tended (and, I&rsquo;m told, still do) to behave pretty much as they did in their countries of origin.  I won&rsquo;t go into details for fear of offending: but all the steriotypes apply.</p>
<p>The tendency toward bad behavior will not go away with time.  Hybridization will possibly mitigate, but also might exacerbate. I once noted two separate but strangely similar gruesome murders in California.  One murder was committed by a man and his girlfriend.  Each was half-black/half-Japanese.  The other murder was committed by a man who was half-black/half-Japanese.  What will happen when you cross a Pakistani with a Croatian?  Nigerian with Romany?  I have no idea.  Do the English really want to find out by experiencing the result?</p>
<p>In the Mississippi Delta, there are a lot of exotic hybrids.  Once again, I won&rsquo;t specify.  But there are not a lot of happy outcomes or pretty people resulting from those crosses.  Most do far worse, and are far less attractive, than their ethnically &#8216;pure&rsquo; cousins.  The experiment failed.  The melting pot did not produce a valuable alloy.</p>
<p>I hate to see the same thing happening to England.  My Grandmother used to coo reassuringly, &#8220;There will always be an England!&#8221;  Sadly, I&rsquo;m afraid she may have been wrong.</p>

			<p>Trouble is, in UK, we are not counted out and counted back in. Anyone with a UK passport leaves and enters without any record in the passport. My latest has been used many times around Europe and to re-enter UK. There is absolutely no record and every page is still completely blank. Those pakistanis with UK passports just wander around without trace, unless they visit USA of course, then all UK citizens are treated with undue scrutiniy, even though it&rsquo;s patently obvious with one glance at the name, face and dress who is, and who isn&rsquo;t, a potential problem. This is called racial profiling (which is illegal)  instead of common sense (which is legal). That takes care of airports, now lets examine the situation along the southern border&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>This is really aimed at muslims but if the USA only scrutinzed muslims, then there would be all sorts of yelling and screaming of &#8220;racism&#8221; and profiling and tons of lawsuits so we end up at great expense treating EVERYONE the same. This is the insanity that is today. A white, elderly christian lady from say Kansas or from England taking a vacation to Florida is treated the same as a young muslim male from Pakistan. </p>

<p>Sir Andrew is certainly not a knight of old, who would have sallied forth in defense of his people&rsquo;s women and children, if only in a political manner.  Instead, he rather blandly notes that rape is something to be endured if his nation is to finish its social demise.</p>
<p>Chivalry is truly dead.</p>
