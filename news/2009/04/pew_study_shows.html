			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, the Pew Hispanic Center released a report entitled &#8220;A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants&#8221; in the United States providing some of the most recent and detailed statistics available about illegal aliens living in the United States. These statistics reveal that at a time when America can least afford additional financial and economic burdens, illegal aliens are straining taxpayers in regards to health care, education, and other social services.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic study reveals that illegal immigration is placing a strain on America&rsquo;s education system. Children of illegal aliens now represent 6.8% of the total population of students enrolled in Kindergarten through 12th Grade, up from 5.4% in 2003. In five states  &mdash;  Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas  &mdash;  10% of K through 12 students have parents who are illegal aliens. (Id. at 9).</p>
<p>Pew&rsquo;s data also reveals that illegal aliens are far less educated than the U.S. population as a whole. Pew states that illegal alien adults between the ages of 25 and 64 are disproportionately uneducated and unskilled when compared to U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. Nearly 29% of illegal aliens in the United States possess &#8220;less than a ninth-grade education; an additional 18% have some high school education but have not completed high school.&#8221; This compares to 2% and 6% of U.S. citizens in that age range who, respectively, have not reached the ninth-grade level or the equivalent of a high school degree.  (Id. at 10). Younger illegal aliens (ages 18 to 24) do not fare much better: 40% of illegal aliens in that age group have not completed high school, compared to 15% of legal immigrants and 8% of U.S. citizens in the same age group (Id. at 11-12).</p>
<p>Pew Hispanic states that the fact that illegal aliens tend to be unskilled and uneducated reveals why illegal alien adults are also disproportionately represented among the poor. Pew found that 21% of illegal aliens inside the United States are considered &#8220;poor&#8221; (compared to 13% of legal immigrant adults and 10% of U.S. citizen adults). Additionally, illegal alien adults and their U.S.-born children account for 11% of the total U.S. population living below the poverty level, &#8220;twice their representation in the total population.&#8221; (Id. at 17).</p>
<p>The Pew report contained figures concerning the impact of illegal aliens on the American health care system as well. Pew reports that 59% of illegal aliens, 45% of illegal alien children, and 25% of U.S.-born children of illegal aliens lacked health insurance in 2007. This last figure stands in stark contrast to the 8% of children of U.S. citizen parents who were uninsured in 2007. (Id. at 18).</p>

			<p>When I was in the 7th and 8th grade in Midland, TX there were alot of hellspawn from illegal aliens at the school. They were there to do two things, &#8220;free lunch&#8221; or cause trouble. They also didn&rsquo;t get along with the blacks either, having a MASSIVE fight in the gym that took the police to break up.</p>

			<p>This study will be condemmed by the PC police as racist, among other unwholesome descriptions. This would also be more enlighting if we had some stats on the U S prison population and the high violent crime rate among the illegals. Here in So. Calif. most of the fatal hit and runs are eventually attributed to the illegals. You never see them stop to offer assistance to those injured, or own up to their responsibility as humans. We will continue to see more violence until this problem is addressed by our leaders. In the meantime, don&rsquo;t hold your breath!</p>

			<p>  The US is pulled down by illegal immigrants and their supporters.<br>
  These are  just more reasons why all illegal aliens and their children need to be deported now and all the supporters of illegal aliens - who aid, abet, counsel, induce, procure for or assists in any way illegal aliens appear to me to be in violation of US Criminal Code Section 2 (a) 18 USC Sec 2 and other laws. This could include lawyers, judges, preachers, and politicians whose support for illegal aliens who violate the civil rights of US citizens, or benefit illegal aliens by allowing them to benefit from the breaking of the law can be prosecuted under other laws.<br>
The laws already exist.  Insist that the laws be enforced and stand up for your own civil rights or you will have none in a system that requires that you use or lose a right.<br>
 If I am wrong please explain to me why.</p>

<p>Anybody here want to see Geraldo Rivera go berserk, froth at the mouth, scream hysterically and threaten to spit in somebody&rsquo;s face?  (He told Michelle Malkin on Fox when she quoted stats unfavorable to illegals that he&rsquo;d like to spit in her face.  Can you imagine a non-liberal saying that to a liberal and keeping his job?) </p>
<p>Well, just show him that headline, and then step back.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a nutcase react as he does constantly on the subject, claiming that illegals are a huge plus for this country.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in about the same league as Susan Sarandan or Garafalo (sp?)</p>
<p>I promise that&rsquo;s not an exaggeration.</p>

			<p>Plus, we need to retroactively undo the 1965 immigration act and rescind the part of the 14th amendment that is no longer useful to &#8216;the immediate children of former slaves&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Only then, can we get back to a better process of &#8216;selection&rsquo; of immigrants to allow in.</p>
<p>Just because you can walk here (Mexico), steal away in the belly of a ship (China), or fudge on your expired visa (Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Auntie&#8221;), does not allow you any right to remain.</p>

			<p>I can absolutely attest to the burden that anchor babies put on our educational system. For one thing, it&rsquo;s true that most of our illegals here are illiterate. To compound matters, of these illiterates, most have no concept that parents send their children to school with a few things in place: experiences being read to, having conversations with adults, knowing some basic facts and skills, and so forth. When these kids enter our educational system, they are behind and most never catch-up enough to close the achievement gap. Worse, it&rsquo;s tough to convince the parents that the children are behind and need to work hard to catch-up when they perceive that compared to themselves, their children are academic wonders.</p>
<p>Of course, the blame for their low achievement lands squarely on their teachers. Teachers are urged to spend more time working exclusively with these students. Even whole group instruction suffers since teachers frequently have to teach a &#8220;lesson before the lesson&#8221; to provide these kids with the necessary background information. This slows down instruction for OUR kids. As a parent, this frosts me. </p>
<p>Lastly, students who receive free breakfast, lunch, and tutoring (through private companies at taxpayer expense), also have cable TV, the latest gaming systems, and a big honkin&rsquo; SUV dropping them off at school. There is no requirement for income verification whatsoever. Yet, when our paying kids lose their lunch money at school, they get a &#8220;snack&#8221; and a disgusted look from the lunch lady. How is this right?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Illegals are bankrupting hospitals, schools.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, illegals are being allowed to bankrupt the heritage of Americans because Americans have no leaders that represent them, AND, WE Americans won&rsquo;t get off our collective butts and remove each and every official that is not representing us as per the Constitution and laws that Americans have created to protect US. PERIOD!!</p>

			<p> I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that most Americans don&rsquo;t care about illegal immigration. If enough citizens did care about it politicians would be jumping over one another yelling &#8220;down with illegal aliens, deport them now!&#8221; Yes, it must be a sad fact that most Americans are oblivious to the world around them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that most Americans don&rsquo;t care about illegal immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above statement is inaccurate.  In fact, poll after poll, after poll shows that the MAJORITY of American citizens want to stop illegal immigration.  It is just that politicians ignore our desires, because they are paid off in campaign contributions by industries that want wage-slaves.  Politicians are also threatened by the liberal media if they don&rsquo;t toe the leftest PC line.</p>
<p>It is about GREED!  Meat-packing plants, carpet mills, agriculture, restaurants, hotels, contractors, etc. can make enormous profits if they fire American citizen workers and hire illegals at lower salaries.  Also, these selfish businesses don&rsquo;t pay for the health care, education, policing, housing subsidies, public transportation, etc., for these immigrants   &mdash;   we do!.  These greedy businessmen privatize profit and socialize costs. </p>
<p>The worst part is, not only do millions and millions of uneducated, low-skilled, desperate immigrants drive down wages and replace American workers, but American citizens (who now have lower wages b/c of competition, or are unemployed) are forced to pay for all of this in taxes.  Ask yourself: That money you paid in taxes to educate the children of the Mexican family down the street or to pay $20,000/yr to incarcerate that Mexican criminal   &mdash;   Could your family have used that money?  Every government agency in your city, state, and federal gov. office is staffed with people with thick foreign accents (recent immigrants).  Could your children have benefited from those jobs?  Your taxes paid for that job, why can&rsquo;t your children be employed there?  You go to work and work hard, and then the government takes away YOUR and spends it on illegal immigrants.  This scheme is marketed as &#8220;We&rsquo;re a nation of immigrants&#8221; or &#8220;Diversity is our Greatest Strength&#8221; or &#8220;No humans are illegal.&#8221;  Note how your healthy and correct desire to keep the government from robbing YOU and your family and giving YOUR money to foreigners is twisted into &#8220;racism.&#8221;  If you complain about illegal immigration taking American jobs, then they call you a racist.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re  oblivious to the world, it&rsquo;s that many have been so braiwashed by political correctness or the media telling them that diversity is their strength, or are too afraid of being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; to speak out.<br>

			<p>Most Mexicans wandering into our country have children who are scoring on average at near imbecile levels on IQ tests (82) that presume no academic training whatsoever, the so-called culture fair tests, according to recent research at Harvard and Princeton. By inheritance, they have low power intellects due probably to small brain size, and expensive educational efforts to train and mainstream them only frustrate them, making them deeply resentful.</p>
<p>Most are acculturating to the black underclass cultural norms, as past AR posts have noted: hip hop, petty larceny, gangs, narcotics distribution and retail, women getting serially pregnant by different men, and living off government dole. We are being colonized by people who can barely scratch out a living if left to their own devices without the benefit of welfare or crime. Why do we tolerate it? </p>

			<p>I canceled my subscription to our local communist progaganda rag several months ago.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you know, the first time I read it in months, and the front page features an article discussing how difficult it has gotten for teenagers to find jobs these days.  And the reason given was increased competition from older workers in this bad economy.  Not one word about the competition from from millions of illegals flooding into the U.S. over the years.</p>
<p>For any AmRen readers out there that still subscribe to their local papers   &mdash;   please help our cause and cancel your subscriptions immediately!<br>

			<p>Los Angeles is filled with Latin American tribesmen working as security guards.  The biggest employer of these guys is Securitas.</p>
<p>Securitas has a lot of contracts with hospitals and government agencies.  It is of course illegal for government contractors to employ illegal aliens. But they do and the government agencies never check and pride themselves on the diversity of their contractors.</p>
<p>The securitas tribesmen average about 4 ft 10.  Some are smaller.  They weigh maybe 80 pounds.  They do not speak Spanish or English.  Instead they speak their tribal language that makes a sort of barking noise.  They are from such primitive areas that they do not speak any Spanish at all.</p>
<p>I have to laugh at the security guards.  Tiny little men who are the size of a 10 year old boy.  Security guards aren&rsquo;t supposed to get physical, but they are supposed to call 911 as needed.</p>
<p>When I hear them barking away in their pre literate language I wonder how they can call 911 if needed.  LAPD has dispatchers who speak many languages, but not any who can speak these rainforest tribal languages that only maybe 5, 000 people in the entire world speak.  I often wonder how they can make a report to the police if needed, or testify or answer an officer&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>Being illiterate, they cannot write out an incident report.<br>
Since they can&rsquo;t speak Spanish they cannot communicate with anyone other than their fellow tribespeople, all 5,000 of them.</p>
<p>A major job of security guards is giving directions and helping people.  They can&rsquo;t understand or speak a word of any other language than their tribal tongue. So they just bark or shrug their shoulders when a customer asks for directions.</p>
<p>Given their size, I can&rsquo;t imagine that any agressive, obnoxious person, let alone a criminal would be intimidated by them.  Also they would not understand if a clerk or customer called for help.</p>
<p>I first encountered one of them when I went into a big drug store on a very rainy night.  I heard someone barking.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell who it was.  Then I saw this 10 year old dressed up in a Securitas uniform barking away at me.  Finally the cashier said &#8221; He wants you to put your umbrella in the bucket&#8221;  Then I saw the store had put out plastic buckets so umbrellas wouldn&rsquo;t drip on the floor.</p>
<p>This happened in Westwood Village where the only languages spoken are English, Farsi, Mandarin and Spanish.  Actually the only language spoken in Westwood is English since all the Persian, Chinese and Spanish immigrants speak English most of the time.  Even the hispanic dishwashers speak English to themselves most of the time.</p>
<p>Securitas has to bring in a 4ft 10 guy who looks like a ten year old and cannot communicate in Spanish, let alone English.</p>
<p>I began seeing them manning the metal detectors at various government offices around town.  The social security offices all have security guards.  I&rsquo;m retired now and when I went to social security there it was, another 4ft 10 illiterate unable to speak a word of Spanish let alone English.</p>
<p>I ran into another one at a hospital.  I finished up my treatment and was walking out when I heard this barking behind me.  I just continued where I was going.  He kept barking and barking.  Finally someone else said in Spanish, &#8220;Senora, he&rsquo;s just tryiing to tell you where is the exit.&#8221;  I turned around and there he was in all his glory, 4ft 9 and trying to give me directions in his obscure tribal language.</p>
<p>Another company that hires these 4ft 10 tribesmen is Iron Mountain.  Iron Mountain is a major, major wealthy nationwide company.  Among other things they handle file and record storage.</p>
<p>A few years ago they moved into Los Angeles in a big way.  They have massive warehouses in the East LA industrial area and trucks of all sizes running around all over delivering records.</p>
<p>They have long contracts with the public school system, colleges, big comapnies, hospitals and government agencies.  Iron Mountain has taken over the records storage business in Los Angeles. They succeeded by underpricing the competition with their cheap, cheaper, cheapest labor.</p>
<p>The employees are these Latin American Indians.  A lot of hospitals and large companies use Iron Mountain. Of course the American record clerks were fired.  And when the Americans file for unemployment who works there?  Got it, non white immigrants who barely speak English.  </p>
<p>Last time I was on unemployment was about 20 years ago.  The guy I had to deal with was some sort of Pacific Islander Malay type.  He had such a thick accent I could not understand a word he said. He could not understand a word I said. He could not read the forms.  He did manage to usethe keyboard.</p>
<p>I at least speak perfect English.  But I was unemployed in an English speaking country and the guy who could not speak or understand a word of English worked in a life long tenure government job. Of course I&rsquo;m white and therefor unemployable by law.</p>
<p>There are only 2 explanations for a non English speaker working for the State of California.  (1) He paid someone who spoke English to do his interview, which is very common in Asian Pacific Islander corrupt cultures or (2) The California Unemployment Department hired him knowing full well he could not speak or understand English.<br>
