			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Mercer, BBC News, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The sounds of a lost language echo across a packed classroom in suburban Sydney as high school children help to revive an ancient part of Australia&rsquo;s rich indigenous culture.</p>
<p>Dharug was one of the dominant Aboriginal dialects in the Sydney region when British settlers arrived in 1788, but became extinct under the weight of colonisation.</p>
<p>Details of its demise are sketchy but linguists believe the last of the traditional Dharug speakers died in the late 19th Century, and their unique tongue only survives because of written records.</p>
<p>In a remarkable comeback, Dharug now breathes again  &mdash;  its revitalisation helped by the efforts of staff at Chifley College&rsquo;s Dunheved campus in Sydney.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve already reclaimed it. That&rsquo;s why there is so much interest. People are already speaking it,&#8221; said teacher Richard Green, who, like others, has fought passionately to rejuvenate the ways of his ancestors that were lost after European settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&rsquo;t allowed to speak it. They had to learn English or they were punished,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><b>Language &#8216;engineering&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>When the British ships arrived, there were about 270 different Aboriginal languages in Australia. Today, only about 60 or 70 are spoken on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Of these, roughly half a dozen are considered to be strong and are being passed from adults to their children, according to John Hobson, a lecturer at Sydney University.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can regard any language in the world as worth preserving because it has its own unique nature and contains information that we might not be able to express or find in other languages,&#8221; he told the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the first languages of Australia. They have suffered incredible attrition at the hands of over 200 years of the invasion of English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other indigenous dialects in Australia have been revived but the revitalisation process may require what experts describe as &#8220;language engineering&#8221;  &mdash;  the borrowing of phrases and words or the coining of new vocabulary for a modern world in ways similar to those undertaken by New Zealand&rsquo;s Maori and the Hawaiians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I often compare Aboriginal languages to something somewhere between Japanese and Latin. That surprises people because the gut approach is to go for something primitive and simplistic which they are definitely not.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are an item of cultural pride and are very complex languages,&#8221; said Mr Hobson.</p>
<p><b>Talking culture</b></p>
<p>At Chifley College, where around a fifth of the students are Aboriginal, Dharug is taught twice a week with great energy through repetition and song.</p>
<p>&#8220;Badagarang!&#8221; shouts the class when asked the word for kangaroo. Dingo, wallaby and koala are derived from Dharug.</p>
<p>The language courses are open to non-indigenous pupils, who now have a greater understanding of their country&rsquo;s rich indigenous history.</p>
<p>For Aboriginal students like Steven Dargin, 16, it is all about identity and pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s good especially for the black fellas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You get to talk about your own culture and all that. Learn more stuff and speak it out of school.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cousin Colleen Dargin, 16, was equally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s all about the Aboriginal language because not many people know it and it&rsquo;s real good that Mr Green is in there teaching us,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Dharug is firmly embedded in the college&rsquo;s curriculum and Joyce Berry, the deputy principal, wants to export the idea to other schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a really big journey that we are on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would be wonderful if it could go across to other schools as well and that is the aim.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this can work, it is something that a school in western Sydney has been able to achieve with the support of the elders,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can do that it&rsquo;s going to be such a wonderful thing not just for the school but for the Dharug community.&#8221;<br>

&ldquo;I often compare Aboriginal languages to something somewhere between Japanese and Latin. That surprises people because the gut approach is to go for something primitive and simplistic which they are definitely not.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The Japanese language expresses itself on the page using Kenji characters. Latin uses our familiar European alphabet. Aboriginal languages, having no written version at all, necessarily has neither characters nor an alphabet. It can&rsquo;t express itself on the page using its own symbols or alphabet because it is only a SPOKEN language. </p>
<p>This being the case, how much could these Aboriginal languages REALLY resemble either Japanese OR Latin?</p>
<p>And considering Australia&rsquo;s Aborigines have the lowest mean IQ in the world   &mdash;   under 70, which is even lower than African blacks; and &#8220;borderline-retarded&#8221; by white standards   &mdash;   then &#8220;primitive and simplistic&#8221; is probably an apt description for them after all. &#8220;Primitive and simplistic&#8221; may be impolite, but it is accurate. </p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t fluent in this Aboriginal language, it might be difficult for you to say whether it is primitive or not? </p>

			<p>I wonder how many decades it will be until English is extinct in Australia. I wonder if the conquerors will have punished the Native Australians for speaking English, or simply exterminated them. I wonder how many of the Euros and Abos in that packed classroom will live to find out. </p>
<p>If they want to teach useful language skills, they should concentrate on Arabic and Chinese. Start with expressions like: &#8220;Yes sir&#8221;, &#8220;No sir&#8221;, &#8220;Right away Sir&#8221;, and &#8220;I enjoy being your slave&#8221;.</p>

<p>That happened to the non-English speaking people of the British Isles way before the indigenous Australians copped it.</p>

			<p>Few things here Anon. I have an advanced degree in Linguistics and have worked as a linguist and anthropologist before. The Aboriginal languages are renowned for being the most maddeningly and insanely complex and near-impossible to learn as any languages on Earth. We are still trying to get to the bottom of some of them. They are up there with Japanese, Chinese, Caucasian, Finnish, Hungarian and Basque as some of the toughest languages to learn on Earth.</p>
<p>Primitive people the world over usually have way more complex languages than civilized people. As a people civilizes, the language radically simplifies. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the Aboriginal is &#8220;retarded&#8221; in the same way that a US sub-70 IQ is. Language is innate in the human mind and all humans can learn and probably even create the most insanely complex languages you could possibly imagine. I doubt if IQ has anything to do with it at all.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t a country betetr off with just one language? Look at Canada. Look at Belgium. Linguistic unity is a great thing and should be promoted, not reduced.</p>

			<p>With all due respect, commentors on this website really hurt their cause with low brow stupidity. Too often comments on this site amount to ignorant jeering at other races, which is at the end a hindrance to really understanding the issues facing whites today. </p>
<p>Whites are the only race to have ever taken an interest in history as a whole and other kinds of people. There is a great benefit to really understanding other races, and understanding at all levels, from street level experiential all the way up to high brow intellectual, for those who are capable. </p>
<p>Change of topic, for those able to understand: the written word is a powerful tool, but it also has a seed of destruction because it allows people to have &#8220;book knowledge&#8221; that is at complete odds with real world experience. This bookishness has hurt our race by allowing our young to be filled with fabricated ideas that are at complete odds with reality. Feminism, racial equalitarianism, &#8220;one world&#8221; ideas of justice. </p>
<p>What our young people need most is to snap out of the bookish false ideas and instead of listening to the ORAL testimony of their own elders, which would tell them many truths about race. So &#8220;text-ism&#8221; is not always a godsend, it can be a tool for separating the head from the heart. A language is first and foremost the ORAL testimony that comes from the heart, and ignoring this truth is perilous. </p>

<p>Every language is a spoken language. No one questios the value of written language, but writing is not language. Writing is a way to represent language.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if this language includes a system of counting that extends beyond the number 2.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe not, but it may have ten times as many kinship terms as English does. You might be surprised.</p>
<p>Surely there is something to be learned from this obscure little language. I&rsquo;m not apologizing for the ways this language revival may be misused by leftists, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with preserving a language that would otherwise become extinct. There will never be another chance for this language to develop, and once it&rsquo;s lost, it&rsquo;s lost.</p>

			<p>Some Amren posters would be shocked and amazed to read an alleged English classic like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in its original Old English.  I have a copy and it is fascinating, but also a witness to how much language changes over time.</p>
<p>It is not the act of preserving Aboriginal languages that is a threat, it is the assumption that any interest in other humanity is co-opted by Marxists as a tool for undermining the existing order.  That is what ought to be resisted.</p>

<p>I for one would not be upset if this language were lost. If there is something worthwhile still to say, by all means translate it. The problem isn&rsquo;t too little diversity but too much. More diversity just means more fault-lines. Isn&rsquo;t racial separation enough? </p>

			<p>As a Canadian I can only say that there is absolutely nothing at all to be gained from linguistic duality or diversity. Canada would have been better off in every possible way if it had absorbed it&rsquo;s French-speaking population.</p>

			<p>What most here seem to forget is that languages and terms encompass a worldview. When a language and its vocabulary are lost, insight into the part of the world where the language is from is lost as well.  </p>
<p>I speak, read and write seven languages, including Cherokee. There never was much of anything primitive about Southeastern Natives, as we&rsquo;re known to have been the members of the Mississippian civilization before Europeans visited the region. A very sophisticated culture with laws and regulations.</p>
