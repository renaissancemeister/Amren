<h1><a href="https://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/04/27/daily11.html?ana=yb_atl">UPS Makes $750K Grant to National Council of La Raza</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Atlanta Business Chronicle, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>United Parcel Service Inc. gave $750,000 to Hispanic civil rights group National Council of La Raza (NCLR) to help that organization develop programs and services for Latino communities.</p>
<p>The grant will go to NCLR&rsquo;s Campaign for Stronger American Communities to provide direct services or advocacy for millions of Latinos in education, health, home ownership and workforce development.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based UPS (NYSE: UPS) has worked with NCLR since 1982 and is the 2009 Title Sponsor of Latino Expo USA, which will be held at the NCLR 2009 Annual Conference, July 25-27 in Chicago.</p>

			<p>The trouble is&hellip; we&rsquo;ve allowed ourselves (whites) to become victims of our consumerism.  Little did we know that supporting all these companies that forced out the mom &amp; pops was also destroying what little remained of our influence on America.  Since we can&rsquo;t seem to live without certain things (sports included), we are excelerating our own demise.  We can&rsquo;t even swing an election anymore and we&rsquo;re still the majority.</p>
<p>Refuse to spend your money anywhere that doesn&rsquo;t give back to YOU and YOUR KIND!<br>

			<p>UPS is based in Atlanta, and that metro area and parts of Georgia are growing quickly in terms of Hispanic population.  Any UPS executives live in Hispanic neighborhoods?  Or are they just jonesing for cheap and non-union labor?</p>

			<p>Why not thousands for &#8216;programs and services&rsquo; for white communities? Because there are none? And if there were, we would denounce it as evil and work to foster diversity there?</p>
<p>Why not money for AmRen instead of La Raza? because there are thousands of groups working for whites and only one group looking out for Hispanic interests?</p>
<p>Wait, I got that backwards.</p>

			<p>$750K is probably only a small fraction of what the U.S. Government gives to Hispanic enterprises.</p>
<p>I saw an &#8220;Hispanic Yearbook&#8221; several years ago that was filled with advertisements from various branches of the Armed Services and Government agencies.  The yearbook itself may have been paid for by the U.S. Government.  Hispanic organizations were encouraged in the Agency where I worked and corresponding white organizations were prohibited. Conventions of Hispanic and black employees were sponsored by the Government and employees, as I recall, were given offical time to attend.</p>
<p>In downtown Washington, DC close to the National Geographic Headquarters a large flag flew proudly with LA RAZA (The Race) written on it in large letters.  </p>
<p>That flag did not refer to the Caucasian race.  If it did the people of color would have ripped it down.</p>

			<p>Whatever cause will cause UPS to make more moolah for itself is all that they care about. If it makes our country poorer as a whole, or if it makes the working poor of this land poorer, so what? Would they give mooolah to organizations that help only  Polish, Russian, Irish, Italians? No, that would be racist. </p>

			<p>How is UPS any different from all the other race traitors, who vote for marxists and worship diversity?  Ultimately, UPS is buying support from the marxist federal government.  They can say, &#8220;look what we&rsquo;re doing for your mestizo minions, now protect us from lawsuits and throw some business our way&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Whites are the real cause of their own destruction.  Do you think a group like La Raza could exist in any sane civilization?  La Raza is supported and empowered by marxist Whites.  They are the enemy.  Marxist Whites will be destroyed by their peons, but unfortunately they will take the rest of us with them.</p>

			<p>Go to the NCLR website and check out their corporate partners. Then send each an email telling them why you are going to boycott them. Then tell a friend to do the same thing.</p>

			<p>UPS, unscrupulous as it is, is just staying ahead of the curve.  UPS sees the direction this country is heading, and the donation is like a welcome basket to it&rsquo;s new customers.  The latinos are sauntering across our border daily, and our government is doing almost nothing to impede or remove them.  Once here, they rapidly outbreed whites, and their influence is ballooning. </p>

Fedex <a href="https://about.fedex.designcdt.com/corporate_responsibility/diversity/community/outreach" rel="nofollow">supports</a> La Raza, the Urban League, the NAACP, and a group called the National Hispanic Corporate Achievers Awards. It also contributes to <a href="https://about.fedex.designcdt.com/corporate_responsibility/diversity/community/scholarship_funds" rel="nofollow">scholarship funds</a> for blacks, Hispanics and Asians (!) - because you know there aren&rsquo;t enough Asians attending college. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s immigration - the money all lines up on one side of the issue.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s in this for UPS?  I&rsquo;m going to guess that, just as the Ford and other foundation has been taken over by Reds with degrees from elite universities, many corporations are also run by Marxists.  Whatever Marxism has claimed to be, in practice it has always been about bright people with a grudge against normal society taking power and using it to destroy their enemies.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that the traitors on the boards of directors of these corporations laugh when they think how they can live like filthy rich capitalists, and carry out the Revolution too.  </p>

<p>Google &#8220;FedEx La Raza&#8221; and see what that gets you.  I did.  About the fourth item down is a listing of corporate donors to La Raza.  FedEx is there, along with UPS and a load of others.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take my word for it.  Google them yourself.</p>

			<p>Starting today, I will not use UPS for anything.  I will also request anyone shipping to me use someone other than UPS.  If enough people BOYCOTT UPS they might get the message.  Lets start the boycott here and keep it going from now on.  This is one way we can actually do something about it.  Why spend your money with companies that do not care about you?  If the white people will stick together for once then we can accomplish something.  Maybe someone could start a boycott UPS movement on the internet. </p>

			<p>absurd for a company that primrily derives revenue from the white community(businesses!) gives money to a political advocacy, anti-white group. No excuse. </p>
<p>A Broadly-based company like UPS should focus on charities that help everyone-cancer, heart, boys clubs, Girl Scouts, etc.  UPS is setting itself up for demands to hire a minimum percentage of Latinos.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who they hire since I don&rsquo;t think the govt should tell any employer who they should hire. But this is a first step in quotas. Something about La Raza scares UPS, and this contribution smells like a payoff.</p>

			<p>What is this obsession with Mexicans? Their country is as bad as Iran with the beheadings, kidnappings and crime of all sorts? It is a wealthy country, but that wealth is concentrated within the government/elite/drug lords (all one and the same), their poor and uneducated flood across our borders bringing crime, disease and financial drain on citizens of this country. Yet one administration after another fawns over them and almost begs them to come even though we have millions here out of work. Maybe I&rsquo;m missing something, but if I had my way, we build the fence, back it up with military and forget it&rsquo;s on the other side.</p>

			<p>It is inconvenient for me to have my ebay purchases shipped by US Postal. But from now on, and for all business purchases, I will insist that neither Fedex nor UPS be the carrier.  Enough is enough.  Supporting LaRaza is beyond insane.  How these companies could do such a thing taxes the limits of my comprehension.</p>
<p>Folks, please tell me that the Postal Service is not donating to RaRaza, too!</p>

			<p>Whether you use UPS or not, there are no real alternatives.  FedEx and USPS both push diversity and contribute to the people that will eventually take our place.  I am sure DHL and all the little players are no different.  You reap what you sow has never been truer.</p>

			<p>So if we want something shipped we have 3 choices, UPS(anti-White), FedEx(Anti-White), or the fedreral gov&rsquo;t. This sounds like a good oppurtunity for the formation of a pro-White, co-op shipping co. Who&rsquo;s in? </p>

			<p>This is simply a shakedown. UPS and other companies pay off La Raza and there are no problems, no lawsuits, no pickets. La Raza learned from Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpten.</p>

			<p>&#8220;advocacy for millions of Latinos in education, health, home ownership and workforce development.&#8221;</p>
<p>More free health care, more affirmative action college admissions, more money poured into the drain of public schools, more $800,000 mortgages granted to people on welfare who can never pay them and more no whites need apply policies.</p>
<p>Advocacy for Latinos means more transfer of White&rsquo;s taxes to latins.</p>
<p>UPS, like every corporation is the enemy of Whites.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Their country is as bad as Iran with the beheadings, kidnappings and crime of all sorts? &#8220;</p>
<p>I live in West Los Angeles also known as Little Teheran. The area is full of Iranians who fled Iran.  They are mostly Jews.  Muslim, Zoroastrian and Christian Iranians have their enclaves elsewhere in S. California.</p>
<p>The Iranians go back and forth and keep in touch with friends and relatives.  According to these Iran-Americans who claim to be refugees from an oppressive society, Iran is not so bad as long as one goes along to get along.  Iran does not tolerate dissidents, but leaves people alone who conform to the laws.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mexican crime and corruption hurts everyone in Mexico, even the elites who must hire drivers and bodyguards to keep their children from being kidnapped on their way to school.</p>
<p>Iranian police can go about their work without being murdered by criminals more powerful than the government.  Iran has a pretty good welfare system although it is administrated by the mullahs.</p>
<p>Iran is a great country compared to Mexico.</p>

			<p>Much of this kind of thing is extortion.  $750 million is cheap compared to the cost of years of discrimination litigation which UPS would probably lose.  Their would also be massive boycotts including by government agencies.</p>
