<p>{snip} But under a new program that began Feb. 23 and is intended to increase the number of highly skilled soldiers, the American military is now allowing some temporary immigrants to enlist.</p>

<p>Those of you old enough to have children considering an enlistment in the U.S. armed forces, think about how you would like your 18 to 21 year old son or daughter facing down the enemy, with the person right next to them from God knows where, who speaks little English, and keeps muttering prayers to allah while the moslems are throwing grenades at him or her. Or how about your child called up to protect the southern border and he is placed in a troop filled with La Raza, whose loyalty is to mexico and the drug lords who have already bought and paid for his fellow soldiers.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe such tripe would come out of the mouth of a general. If diversity strengthens the military, why wear uniforms? Why have grooming standards? Why have standards at all? Why teach everyone to work as a team? Shouldn&rsquo;t they let handicapped people enlist? What about people with mental issues? I&rsquo;m sure this would make for some interesting diversity.  </p>

<p>Strange coming from someone very high up in the Armed Forces.  Of course the inconvenient truth of the matter is that any good Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine unit is going to know about a concept called collective responsibility.  You screw up, everyone in your unit is going to get punished.  They&rsquo;re trying to teach you that you are responsible for so many other people, and so many other people are responsible for you.  The reason is obvious   &mdash;   on the battle field, one boneheaded mistake by one man, and the whole unit is dead.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like conformity, and something wholly unlike diversity.</p>
<p>Also, the Army, being the most &#8220;diverse&#8221; (read: black) of the branches of the Armed Forces, is for some strange reason the least competent.  The Pentagon can&rsquo;t even rely on the U.S. Army to occupy Iraqi cities, they had to give that job to the Marines.</p>

<p>The vast majority of generals &amp; admirals will spew any amount or level of tripe needed to curry favor with their superiors. Never forget, these are <i>political</i> appointees. Look at what happened to <a href="https://www.antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=8861" rel="nofollow">the generals who questioned the lies of Bush and Rumsfeld</a> in the run-up to the Iraq war.</p>
<p>The higher up the ranks one goes, the stronger the &#8220;go along to get along&#8221; syndrome becomes. Those with stars care only about what I call the &#8220;four P&rsquo;s&#8221;   &mdash;   power, prestige, perks and pension   &mdash;   and will do anything to preserve them. The few exceptions noted above only prove the rule.</p>

<p>It astounds me more and more each day that so many people running the &#8220;show&#8221; actually believe this bull.  It is really frightening because it is so obviously false.  The only things that really strengthen us, or anyone else for that matter, are discipline, belief, commitment, determination, perseverance, integrity, honesty, patience, and one helluva great plan.  The government and the vast majority of our ignorant populace have few to none of the above.  <br>

			<p>What worries me is what these people will be doing after they&rsquo;re left the military.  South and Central America have for decades been plagued with paramilitary groups going around torturing, robbing, and murdering (usually with some flimsy excuse, but not always)anyone they think they can squeeze money out of. Frequently they rob and torture middle and upper class people. The men in these paramilitary units generally came out of someone&rsquo;s military.  Military training makes a bad man into a very, very dangerous man.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, we&rsquo;ll have Russians, Hmong, Nigerians, Somalis, Haitians, Salvadoreans&hellip; Do we really want to give advanced military training to tomorrow&rsquo;s gang leaders?  </p>
<p>And while they are still in the military, assuming we are under martial law, for some reason or another (remember Katrina?), do you really want some Nigerian having power of life or death over you and your family?</p>

			<p>Actually their is something called  the OATHKEEPERS. These people are composed of retired and active duty police and military personel who are dedicated to refuse to obey certain orders given by our commander in chief. I guess if Barack Obama wanted to declare martial law he has figured out how unreliable white men would be in order to enforce such an order. He would certainly need non-whites in the armed forces. This exactly what I think when I hear how the government is willing to recruit anyone for the army. I guess Barack Obama missed the HBO series Rome.It did its best to warn Barack Obama what could happen to an army under certain circumstances.</p>

			<p>The American Empire can not be separated from the current open borders immigation policy. To be more specific, the American Empire can not be separated from the race replacment of Naative Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Millions of Native Born White Americans give their support to the brutal and criminal invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, but these same Americans will not give their sons and daughters up to fight in these two wars. But if you support these two inerventions, the question arises&hellip;WHERE WILL THE WARM BODIES COME FROM?</p>
<p>The invasions if Iraq and Aghanistan requires thousands of warm bodies. This growing need of the Empire requires a propaganda sytem about the blessings of diversity and how importing immigrants is crucial to national defense&hellip;for how else will the EVIL EMPIRE secure  warm bodies to die for the Empire?</p>
<p>The conclusion is obvious:Native Born White Americans should oppose any foriegn intervention that they are unwilling to let their own sons and daughters serve as soldiers in an die in. This would have blocked the emergence of an ideology that  justifies  the race replacement of Native Born White Americans on the basis of national security concerns.</p>
<p>In 2011 the Census bureau will announce-check out yestrdays Peter Brimelow post at vdare.com for more on this- that minority status of Native Born White Americans is inevitable. I blame all you foolish people who post here with your Ronald Reagan nostalgia.</p>
<p>The Repulican party war mongering that you voted for has resulted in Native Born White Americans becomming an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. Your Children and grandchildren are going to expereince vicious racial discrmination and violence at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,africans,asians and muslims.</p>
<p>How ironic  all this is. These wars of aggression waged by both the Republican and Democratic  parties to protect us against the evil commie chinese will result in China&rsquo; borders-through colonization by LEGAL IMMIGRANT chinese-at least a hundred miles into America.</p>

			<p>I have always taken heart from the fact that the actual fighting forces of the U.S. are mostly White, that White infantry would not massacre other Whites on behalf of foreigners.  I suppose that our Rulers have always been troubled by that same fact.  Now, they are going to do something about it.  </p>

			<p>General Casey is a toady who is more than willing destroy Native Born White Americans to advance his career.</p>
<p>Think about what this traitor is saying:1)Nuclear submarine commander Mohammad 2)airforce officers Mohammad,Said and Abdul in the missle sihlos 3)import a couple of hundred thousand chinese nationals,a couple of hundred of theousand and sihk nationals toserve in the US military&hellip;and to top things of ..how about one hundred thousand Mexican Nationals into the US marine core&hellip;.and of course their loyalty will be towards America. Look it is just a bold-face lie.</p>
<p>Here is something to think about:in2011 the majority of births will be non-white. It follows from this fact that the US military in the very near future will be majority non-white. If this ever happens, Native Born White Americans will not have the power to shut down post-1965 immigration policy. The racial transformation of America will accelerate dramatically.</p>

			<p>In Roman history, it was more often than not that the ARMY appointed the Emperor. When, in later years, those soldiers were less and less  Roman citizen, wer begin seeing Emperors who were NOT Romans. This was just before the capitol of the Roman world was changed from Rome to Constantinople. Where shall we have our new capitol??? Mexico or Saudi Arabia??? or HELL!! why not Africa!</p>

			<p>With the economy in the commode why are we having problems recruting soldiers? The only answer is that the 65 years since WW-11 has seen our man hoods bred out of us. The day after 9-11 there were no volunteers at the Times Square recruiting office. We have killed and maimed every other hill billy kid from Appalachia and the human offal in our cities are too busy selling dope and making babies with white women to join. I hope Obama fails and we get into a real depression when our worthless white young bums can generate back bones and we once again have a Scotch-Irish army of murderous whites.<br>

<p>Well said.  Obviously, the military is founded on the principal of a certain lack of diversity - hence the term &#8220;regimentation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&rsquo;t this one of the last stages of a dying empire; recruiting non-citizens?</p>

<p>Yes, it is.  And the last stage of a dying empire?&hellip;&hellip;Dying.</p>
<p>I get the impression that a lot of higher-ups in the armed forces are just political animals - souless toadies who will say or do anything for advancement.  I can only assumed that General Casey is one such.</p>

But I would say that the situation is already dire, since the predominantly white<br>
Congress is not only in sympathy with the directives of the &#8216;65 Act but utterly out of<br>
sympathy with our dwindling majority&rsquo;s strongly expressed will to curtail immigration<br>
from the Third World (both legal and illegal).  A new, domestic colonialism is being<br>
created in Washington:  the overlords will remain, mostly, white, but the servants<br>
of their will mostly be not.  </p>

<p>No but an &#8220;army&#8221; of Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans,Salvadorans and God knows how many Arabs and Pak Muslims who want to kill us has been invading us for years and the above mentioned &#8220;want to kill us&#8221; crowd has been in place and ready for the marching orders when they are issued.

			<p>   The ONLY thing General Comrade Casey is qualified to do is clean toilets in a seedy motel somewhere. This man is so politically correct that he would sell out his country to keep his coozy, cushy job.</p>

			<p>I hate to throw a wet blanket on the quite valid comments here, but I must point out that the U.S. Armed Forces have always &#8220;recruited&#8221; and during the Civil War DRAFTED, that is pressed recent arrivals into service.  In the South, poor Whites were forced to serve while rich Whites bought their way out.  In the North, the Irish immigrants were infamously forced into service.  That eventually resulted in draft riots in NYC where Blacks were attacked as they were seen as the cause for the new Irish &#8220;slavery.&#8221; </p>
<p>Also, as in the South, wealthy Northern men could buy their way out of the draft or service.  (Those who did serve voluntarily, like my great, great uncle, did so for the &#8220;fun&#8221; and financial gain of it.  We have some records of his time in service and there are actually regiment songs whose words reflect the attitude of the volunteers from Upper NY state).</p>
<p>I do agree with the post comparing Roman recruitment of foreigners as a cause of its eventually fall - although there are a number of chief causes, including Christianity (read Gibbon).  But since the U.S. has existed for such a short time and has almost continually been in turmoil, it could be argued that we have been in decline since the moment of formation.  Alexander de Tocqueville pretty much declared this idea.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the link to Abu Jihaad&rsquo;s picture. Gee what a freakin&rsquo; surprise!<br>

<p>This is exactly WHY I say muslims should not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military. Muslims have ONE allegience and it is NOT to the U.S.</p>
