			<p>No, the United States doesnt need the &#8220;strength&#8221;of Mexican workers.It needs to keep the hordes of multiplying Mexicans out.Does Barack Obama see what a phoney Calderon is? Maybe so, but he cant come out and say it. </p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander.  Mexico should open its own southern border, and also dismantle the nationalist portions of its Constitution when it comes to land ownership (though they&rsquo;re only enforced on the coasts, where Mexican land is most valuable).</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Open up the door of hope,&rdquo; Mr. Calderon said</p>
<p>The door of hope for Mexicans should be in Mexico, not another country! If Mexico cannot offer its citizens hope then it is not the responsibility of the USA to allow them to live here. Hope Obama understands this but I&rsquo;m not  so  sure.</p>

<i>&ldquo;Open up the door of hope,&rdquo; Mr. Calderon said</i></p>
<p>What Mr. Calderon is admitting is that Mexico is hopeless and the people have no other hope than to leave.</p>
<p>Imagine President Obama tell Americans, &#8216;your only hope is to leave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>How do people who can neither think or reason obtain these positions of power and influence?<br>

			<p>We might ask ourselves: why would Mexico want an exodus of its own people?</p>
<p>When I was in college, I lived with a Mexican.  He was as White as I am: half German and half Spaniard, with green eyes and the skin tone to match.  He went to a meeting of a Latin Students association.  He came back to our dorm vowing never to return.  Why?  The group was almost entirely mestizos; in his view, they weren&rsquo;t &#8220;real&#8221; latins.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a Mexicans versus Americans issue.  This is a white versus non-white issue.  And the whites in Mexico are elated to see their non-whites flock to the US.  Imagine how you would feel if blacks in the US decided to migrate en masse to Mexico.  America isn&rsquo;t being flooded with average Mexicans; it&rsquo;s become a dumping ground for the least educated, skilled and productive of that society, those whom the rest of Mexico   &mdash;   including its President   &mdash;   are pleased to see leave.  And that&rsquo;s really alarming.</p>

<p>Cultural contributions?  I know Obama is a politician, but how do you say that with a straight face?  I would be worried my face would betray my insincerity.  I lived in Chicago. By &#8220;contributions&#8221; does he mean gangs, wandering pittbulls, and shopping carts filled with children at the grocery store?  In that case, yeah, thanks a whole bunch.  </p>

			<p>If any country on earth is in need of birth control, it is Mexico.  They are overpopulating to the point that there are serious water shortages that threaten their national security.  <br>
And, where there are repreated water shortages there are food shortages as well, because it takes so many thousands of gallons of water to produce just one acre of food.</p>
<p>If North America somehow escapes the ongoing recession without erupting into violence, the continued high birth rate of Mexicans is going to make their country even poorer yet, and they just might implode from a lack of resources in just a few more years.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I imagine they have to keep the drug gangs from taking over first of all.</p>
<p>What an absolute mess that country is.</p>

			<p>The incessant importuning by successive Mexican presidents to open our border and pass &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; is not only infuriating but also pernicious. The Mexican ruling elite simply wants to clear the country of the riff-raff. They have too many poor and want to get rid of them. They need only enough to run the place for them and provide them the amenities they are accustomed to. Income distribution in Mexico is comparable to that of a 1950s style South American junta; if you are not part of the elite or one of its minions, you get nothing and like it.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t like it and show it with their eagerness to flee their country and with its lawlessness. The lawless Mexican cartels may in fact be precusors to a general rebellion against the Mexican ruling elite. Mexico is a pressure cooker and one day it will pop. We should not interfere with this. We should do all we can to insulate ourselves from it. We can not serve as a pressure release valve by surrendering to their version on immigration reform or by not securing our borders and vigorously pursuing and removing Mexican illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The problem with Mexican illegal aliens is a Mexican problem. That is where the problem originates. We Americans are just forced to deal with the consequenses of this problem. But it is not our problem. The Mexican government has a long history of failure and corruption, of irresponsibility towards their people. They continue to exhibit this in their expectation that we should agree to their importuning. They think that this will solve their problem. It won&rsquo;t. We would be fools to play along.<br>
Unfortunately we have become a nation of fools and anything is possible.</p>

<p>What I find so humorous about Calderon saying &#8220;open the door of hope&#8221; is that Mexico has enough of its own.  Any country that could have one of its own, Carlos Slim, be anywhere between the 1st and 3rd richest person in the world, year in and year out, has something going for it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right   &mdash;   Mexico is the typical Latin American plutocracy kleptocracy.  Say what you want about Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, but I think the Chavezian paradigm just might be the right one for countries with the racial makeup of most Latin American ones.  The heavy-handed populist who gravitates toward generous but not ubiquitous wealth redistribution and social welfare programs.  Enough so it keeps them there and not &#8220;migrating&#8221; here.  Chavez doesn&rsquo;t want his poor migrating to America because they&rsquo;re his voters.  That&rsquo;s why I was hoping for an Obrador win in the Mexican elections in 2006. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want the Chavez paradigm for America, though, in that degree</p>

			<p>I agree with QD 100%. The Chavez types make the Latin American rich want to come to the US, but they are no problem. The rest of the Latin American elite is a tiny group of light skinned thieves who steal everything that is not locked down and sentence everyone else to cardboard shacks and tortillas and salt. They export their poor to the US so they don&rsquo;t have fairly divvy up the loot! C&rsquo;mon. Is this not obvious?</p>
<p>Latin American plutocracy and oligarchy creates mass unemployment and poverty and mass illegal immigration to the US. </p>
<p>The Mexican Elite is the cause of the whole mess. Get a clue people.</p>

			<p>Have I missed something? Mexico is the only nation I know of that demands we take care of their people as a God-given right. Suppose all the third world countries in the world could get here and break into our country. When Obama waves the magic wand of citizenship for the illegal criminals (which are all of them), no one will ever be foolish enough to do it right. He&rsquo;s setting a precedent that wipes out any orderly application to become a citizen of this country. We will continue to have people pouring across our borders from everywhere. Here in Texas, Hispanics are already a majority. Soon, it will spread across this once-proud country and we will no longer be the nation our forefathers intended where laws were enforced and the Consitition was upheld. It&rsquo;s going to happen unless we continue to fight.</p>

			<p>It is disturbing how certain terms have become interchangeable when their meaning is in fact different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration&#8221; refers to a legal process. A Mexican citizen crossing the border into the United States is not an immigrant if this person does not do so legally by engaging in the process of immigration. More technically correct would be to call this person an illegal migrant. It has nothing to do with immigration.</p>
<p>An illegal alien migrant can not be dealt with by &#8220;immigration reform.&#8221; This is a law enforcement problem. Let us separate Mexican citizens who legally apply for immigration status from those who illegally migrate here. We do those who participate in a legal process a great disservice by lumping all together and confuse the issue. We don&rsquo;t really need &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; except to establish limits on who we legally allow to be here and to define the reasons why we allow it at all. That would be immigration reform.</p>
<p>Securing the borders and pursuing illegal alien migrants is the job of law enforcement. Let&rsquo;s let them do their job.<br>

<p>Apparently, it wouild appear that instead of Mexico demanding this, it is more like our own Congress and Senate along with respective state legislative representatives who ALSO demand this. </p>
