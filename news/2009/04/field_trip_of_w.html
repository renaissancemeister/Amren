			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Mozingo, Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In his quest to have students experience firsthand how people around the world worship, Varun Soni, the dean of religious life at USC, did not start up some expensive study-abroad program. He just ventured a few blocks from campus.</p>
<p>Within a square mile, he and his staff discovered 67 places of worship. And that was without crossing the Harbor Freeway just to the east.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday about 10 a.m., four Wiccans, a Buddhist, a Sufi and an agnostic filed up the rickety stairs to the balcony of the Virgin Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Hundreds of congregants filled the pews, many men wearing suit coats, women wrapped in gauzy white scarves. They chanted joyously with the choir in Amharic, tended restless children and clapped the deep detonations of the kubaro drum.</p>
<p>With no English translation, the students took in the distinct mix of African sound  &mdash;  the ululating and drums  &mdash;  with the Western fixtures of votive candles, incense and stained glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was beautiful,&#8221; said Jaclyn Kalkhurst, 23, who runs a Pagan-Wiccan group on campus. &#8220;We love the drums. We want to get one now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Soni, a Hindu, says he wants students not just to study religion, but to see how it &#8220;is lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>The volunteers who come along  &mdash;  just for the experience, not for class credits  &mdash;  sit in on the services and then meet with the congregants or clergy to ask questions about their faiths.</p>
<p>This semester, a revolving cast of students went to services at First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chabad, Omar al Khattab Mosque, Senshin Buddhist Temple and Ministerios Manantial de Amor  &mdash;  all near USC. And for a bit more variety they expanded their range, going to a Sikh Gurdwara in Los Feliz, a Krishna temple in Culver City, the Thien Hau Taoist Temple in Chinatown and the Church of the Nazarene on skid row.</p>
<p>The students Sunday said the visits have been fascinating and deepened their own faiths.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to understand what you believe, it&rsquo;s important to understand what other people believe,&#8221; Kalkhurst said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finley took questions from the students as they ate an Ethiopian meal of wat and spongy injera bread.</p>
<p>The priest was not your typical Ethiopian Orthodox officiant  &mdash;  being a white Midwesterner with a big gray beard  &mdash;  but he had a unique vantage from which to introduce newcomers to the religion. Finley, 62, grew up Catholic but did not like the reforms brought about by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, and sought something different. He became a member of the Russian Orthodox Church for 30 years before the spirit of the Ethiopian church captivated him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He explained to Nazanin Angoshtari, 33, an Islamic Sufi, how the Ethiopian and Egyptian Christians, among others, split with the Romans over how to define the nature of Christ in 451 A.D. Romans defined Christ as both man and God, while Ethiopians were among the group that felt Christ had a single divine nature.</p>
<p>Finley laughed about how these technical rifts widened through history with racism and all manner of offenses and power plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the same story with the different seats of Islam,&#8221; said Angoshtari, who described the split between Sunni and Shiite Islam.</p>

			<p>I hope that conservative white Christians who don&rsquo;t think anything about race (I&rsquo;m a white Christian who *does* think about race), will consider this example the next time they call for prayer in school, etc.  They want the kids from their church to be able to pray, which is fine, but haven&rsquo;t thought much about the religious Tower of Babel they&rsquo;re tacitly creating here in America.</p>

			<p>  I will be the first to defend everybody&rsquo;s right to worship whom and where they wish to do so. HOWEVER, nobody should be allowed to push their beliefs on anybody else. Nor should one person&rsquo;s beliefs hinder or obstruct anybody else. That said, I have found in many cases, that the masses are expected to bow down to minority belief systems, that is wrong and should not be allowed to happen. Nor should there be any special considerations made for any religious beliefs that are in the minority.</p>

			<p>Well, we do have freedom of religion in this country.  If one wishes to be a Wiccan or a Sufi, one can.  I just wish the ACLU would extend the principle of freedom of religion to Christians.</p>

			<p>This just isn&rsquo;t worth commenting on, not much  is said above about the religion of pieces!</p>

			<p>Those devoted to &#8216;Futurama&rsquo; are aware that in centuries to come our descendents will have a single undemanding and non-judgemental almalgamated religion. </p>
<p>The students on this Los Angeles field trip - Buddhist, Wiccan and Sufi, seem well on the way now. Stir in some Jedi believers, a primitive Shintoist or two, some low-caste Hindus, Bon practitioner from Tibets and a few Ethiopian Jews and that&rsquo;s about the mix needed</p>
<p>Smells, bells, fancy dress, stained glass windows, nice music, bells and mayve drums and cymbals plus non-judgemental hamony and feel-good fellowship is all we need in a religion.</p>
<p>For those who need something harsher, there&rsquo;s the Landover Baptist Chuch website or the Fred Phelps [&#8216;God hates fags&rsquo;] nutters.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like first-hand experience as oppossed to book knowledge. I got a lot of the latter with a little bit of the former in my study of world religions. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that this massive push for diversity has produced what it has in this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that the weak-minded are swayed by the new, the charismatic, the emotional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied in knowing what all is out there. I got my fill. I don&rsquo;t need to be anywhere else to try anything new. New is not always better. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve read a couple fine books on World Religions, and it is true that these have helped me better understand the faith I was brought up in.</p>
<p>However, I agree with Rudyard Kipling who, in his novel &#8220;Kim,&#8221; pointed out that each faith has &#8220;merit in its own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>California has long had a thorough mix of religions, so this is hardly &#8220;news.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I do think that the American and European cultures are undergoing a radical change in allowing nearly unlimited worldwide immigration to change their national atmospheres. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite sad.</p>
