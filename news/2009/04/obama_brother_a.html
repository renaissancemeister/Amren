			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gloria De Piero, News of the World (London), April 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>American president Barack Obama&rsquo;s half brother was REFUSED a visa to enter the UK after being accused of an attempted sex attack on a young girl in Berkshire.</p>
<p>The News of the World can reveal that Kenya-based Samson Obama tried to get into Britain on his way to Washington for his family&rsquo;s big day, the historic inauguration in January.</p>
<p>But eagle-eyed immigration officials at East Midlands Airport, using the latest biometric tests, discovered he was linked to an incident here last November. The hi-tech database revealed that Samson  &mdash;  who manages a mobile phone shop just outside Nairobi  &mdash;  was the same man arrested by British police after he approached a group of young girls, including a 13 year-old, and allegedly tried to sexually assault one of them.</p>
<p>He then followed them into a cafe where he became aggressive and was asked to leave by the owner. That&rsquo;s when police were called and Samson was arrested.</p>
<p>He supplied officers with his mother&rsquo;s address in Bracknell but gave them a false ID, claiming to be Henry Aloo, believed to be a genuine asylum seeker.</p>
<p>Mum Kezia, 67, has lived in Bracknell for six years. She married the US president&rsquo;s father Barack Obama Snr in Kenya when she was a teenager.</p>
<p>Following Samson&rsquo;s arrest he was fingerprinted but not charged, then left the country. However, all his details were stored on the Home Office&rsquo;s new database of prints and biometric details. And that&rsquo;s what finally pinpointed Samson&rsquo;s link to the world&rsquo;s most powerful leader  &mdash;  as he tried to slip back into Britain to visit relatives en route to the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>The White House was informed and a Home Office source told the News of the World: &#8220;This was obviously an extremely sensitive issue when it was flashed up by the database.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the system is designed to flag up people who have come to the attention of the police in the UK and are then trying to return.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is thought that Samson  &mdash;  one of the President&rsquo;s 11 half brothers and sisters by his father who had four partners  &mdash;  managed to travel on to Washington by boarding a connecting flight to the US from East Midlands.</p>
<p>He was able to do so despite not having a UK visa because he remained in transit and never left the airport. A stewardess from nearby Nottingham told her local newspaper how she met him on his flight to America. Dawn Stewart, of Sherwood, described how Samson told her his nickname was Abo and said he was on his way to the US capital for the presidential swearing-in.</p>
<p>She recalled: &#8220;I asked him how he feels being the brother of the next president and he said, &#8216;I can&rsquo;t tell you the depth of excitement we feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked what Barack was like as a teenager and he said he was always charismatic and calm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flight attendant said Samson claimed he had never travelled before and proudly showed her a headed letter from his half-brother requesting his three-week visa to the USA.</p>
<p>Last night a Home Office spokesman confirmed Samson Obama was refused a visa after immigration officers noticed one of the documents he supplied with his visa application was false. That led to further inquiries.</p>
<p>A UK Border Agency spokesman said: &#8220;We consider all visa applications based on their merits. We will oppose the entry of individuals to the UK where we believe their presence is not conducive to the public good.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK&rsquo;s border controls are among the toughest in the world. All visa applicants are fingerprinted and checked against watchlists. Using this hi-tech system we have detected more than 5,600 attempts to use false identities since December 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our officers in 135 countries are working with law enforcement agencies and airlines to clamp down on forged passports and visas.&#8221;<br/>

Every family has their characters but the Obamas are over represented.</p>
<p>His half-brother (on his black side) is accused of sexual assault. His aunt (on his black side) is an illegal alien on public welfare. His father (a black Kenyan) abandoned his white mother to rear their child without a father (how stereotypical black is that?).</p>

			<p>Put a black in the White House and all of a sudden Billy Carter seems like model of culture, integrity and intellectualism. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s unbelieveable this creature was given a tour of the White House.  He was actually allowed INSIDE the White House and shown things that you and I would be permitted to see. <br/>
Basically, the presidency has been grossly devalued.  It really isn&rsquo;t that prestegious to be the president any longer.  </p>

			<p>Many Presidents have been burdened by kooky brothers, but I think this is the first who&rsquo;s been accused of sexual misbehavior. The first 100 days have been verrrrrry interesting.<br/>
Can&rsquo;t wait to see what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>

			<p>So the difference between this guy and Hussien, is a white womb and nuture. <br/>
The outcomes couldn&rsquo;t be much further apart.<br/>
I&rsquo;m curious, if this brother received the tutorage from his father that little Hussien &#8216;dreamed of&rsquo; so deeply?<br/>
Or was he just just another baby of Africa who was just thrown out into the world without much planning and parental guidance?<br/>
Hussien surely would not have the most powerful job on earth if his father was present in his life.<br/>
You have to be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>I still suspect that when Hussien was elected, that somewhere in the background there were some Randolph and Mortimor Duke type charactors exchanging a single dollar in settling a wager.<br/>

<p>So? Just do your job. Let other people worry about what&rsquo;s senstive or not sensitive. </p>
<p>(Fortunately, that&rsquo;s what they did in the UK, but it&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing with Obama&rsquo;s illegal immigrant aunt in Boston.)<br/>

<p>I was going to say, no surprises here, and this is a relatively good black family. My kingdom for a horse. A horse that would open whites&rsquo; eyes to how shockingly low and primitive the average black really is. It would blow the mind of even most AmRen readers. </p>
<p>Someone should make a black version of &#8220;Being John Malkovich&#8221; where the film shows you the daily life of a black and what is going on (or not going on) in their head. If you want to know what the average black male is thinking at any given moment, just think of James Brown singing &#8220;Bee-Bop-a-Loop-Bop-a-Whop-Bang-Boop&#8221; while robbing and beating and fornicating with every person or shiny object in the field of vision. That would get you pretty close. </p>

			<p>The new movie &#8220;Tyson&#8221; coming out this month should be required viewing for all AmRen readers. The trailer alone (it&rsquo;s online, find it) has some eye opening quotes. </p>
<p>Watch it and really comprehend what is going on inside these people&rsquo;s minds. Think about it next time you let a black man into your home to to service work and next time you feel sorry for a black child. Also think of this when you see the more well behaved black women and know that they know these men up close and personal and defend them and shield them from your vision and acquit them of their crimes when they are on jury duty. </p>

			<p>And the President would reply as follows: &#8220;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you noticed how singularly quiet everyone is with respect to ANY member of the President&rsquo;s family? Kind of like those members of his law review team that actually did the work!   </p>
<p>That being said, I am quite sure that if the need were to ever arise there would be absolutely no question that the President couldn&rsquo;t, albeit perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t, address the status of any member of his family: past, present, distant, or close. All that our erudite President would require would be a month&rsquo;s notice to prepare and a teleprompter with which to read Bill Ayer&rsquo;s answer. </p>

			<p>Let me understand this correctly. This man is now in USA and touring the White House with impunity? What a waste of time by the UK Border Agency. They rarly stop anyone so this must be serious and I thought anyone on the UK watch list was automatically barred from entering USA. I bet I couldn&rsquo;t get in, not without a zillion checks about my 1,000 year proven White English ancestry. So, yah boo sucks&hellip; I refuse to visit.</p>

<p>Ah, but this is also the first one who is African! </p>

It looks like we will have to get used to a few cultural changes.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Following Samson&rsquo;s arrest he was fingerprinted but not charged, then left the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand this!  He was arrested, and fingerprinted    &mdash;   for approaching, following, and harassing a group of young girls, and for sexually assaulting a thirteen year old child &hellip;.  and THEN he was allowed to leave the country?  </p>
<p>I realize that in Kenya a thirteen-year-old is considered a mature woman and fair game to every prowling lothario.  But this is still Britain, isn&rsquo;t it? <br/>
Or isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Lowest age of consent in the world is in the Vatican - 12 years.</p>
<p>This use to be the age of consent in Italy until not very long ago.</p>
<p>The current age of consent in Spain is 13.</p>
