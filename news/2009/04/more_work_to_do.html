<h1>&#8216;More Work to Do&rsquo;: Police Force is Still Struggling to Attract Women, Minorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hinton, Winston-Salem Journal, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite its efforts to build a diverse work force, the Winston-Salem Police Department still struggles to attract women and minorities. </p>
<p>A look at this year&rsquo;s class of police recruits shows that among the 30 recruits, 24 are white men, two are Hispanic men, two are black women, one is a white woman and one is an American Indian man, Chief Scott Cunningham said. Only 20 percent of the recruits are members of underrepresented groups, a fact that concerns him. </p>
<p>&#8220;The department is not where we want to be,&#8221; Cunningham said. &#8220;We want to mirror our community.&#8221; </p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t new  &mdash;  city officials have wrestled with it for 30 years, and the department has made some slow progress in diversifying its ranks. But this is the first class recruited since Cunningham was hired in June 2008. He said last week that the department will &#8220;aggressively recruit&#8221; more minorities and women to the force. </p>
<p>In late January, Cunningham sent a letter to 400 churches in the city, asking for their help in encouraging people to apply to become police officers. </p>
<p>Police recruiters also have visited several historically black colleges and universities in North Carolina, and the department has advertised in brochures distributed at Winston-Salem State University. </p>
<p>The city also has a program to recruit black police officers at WSSU, in which the city pays the tuition of a student who subsequently becomes a Winston-Salem police officer. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to attract diverse candidates,&#8221; Cunningham said. &#8220;We are not as successful as we need to be.&#8221; </p>
<p>Council Member Molly Leight of the Winston-Salem City Council said she was surprised and disappointed at the low numbers of minorities among the recruits. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
Blacks make up 34 percent of Winston-Salem&rsquo;s population, and women make up 52 percent, according the U.S. Census Bureau. Whites make up 51 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, and 12 percent is Hispanic. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The qualifications to become a police officer include being at least 21 years old, having a high-school diploma, and no felony convictions, serious misdemeanors or impaired-driving convictions. Recruits also must pass physical and written tests. </p>

<p>For the first, Allah is indeed merciful. For the second&hellip;the written test will disqualify the rest the dept is FORCED to hire. What color is Cunninbgham anyway?</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m beginning to sound like a repeating CD, but don&rsquo;t these higher echelon politicians in the department know we&rsquo;re in a depression?  I mean, they&rsquo;re going to be lucky keeping the people they have right now.</p>
<p>I truly believe that some whites are such unsophisticated pushovers for brainwashing, they can&rsquo;t depart from the party line even in the face of budget shortfalls so large they have the politicos wringing their hands with worry about finding enough money to keep city hall open.</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing.  But, look at the New York Times.  They&rsquo;re going to go belly up very, very shortly, because of their loss of credibility they&rsquo;ve earned by being recognized as no more than an organ of leftist propaganda, yet they will go straight down the tubes rather change their agenda to fair reporting one iota.</p>

		<p> Try this, all police departments should represent the criminals in the community, that would mean 100% in most major cities would be black law officers. And yes, send in a 95 # female into a black bar to stop a riot. I was in Oakland Ca. in 1976, they had a budget crunch in the police Dept. had to cut down to only have one cop in a patrol car at night unless that was a female, had to have 2 in the car in that case.</p>

<p>In reference to employment, you can&rsquo;t if your community is made up of non-white criminals who wouldn&rsquo;t be eligible for the police force. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make someone want to have a specific job. <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they intend to keep the ones they have, buit replace them with politically correct &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; minorities i.e. blacks (women too, but they must be black)</p>

<p>Last I checked the population of NYC was pretty liberal. As is the population of every large city in the nation, aside from a minority of crazies. <br>

		<p>&ldquo;Despite its efforts to build a diverse work force, the Winston-Salem Police Department still struggles to attract women and minorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city needs to decide if it wants to pander to women and minorities or have the best department that it can possibly have. Sure, there are good police officers who happen to be minorities or females, but they&rsquo;re the ones who could compete on the same scale white males are held to. </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a fast-food restaurant we&rsquo;re talking about. It&rsquo;s a matter of public saftety. This story, and the firefighter storby posted today show that cities are willing to lower the standards to have more &#8220;diverse&#8221; emergency response units. I&rsquo;ve said this on the boards before, but I&rsquo;ll say it again: when lives are lost due to this, there will be lawsuits filed against the city. </p>

<p>More liberal in urban areas?  Yes, a bit more to one degree or another, but who are these Liberals?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you who they are.  Mostly non-whites who are uneducated, and mentally disturbed white leftists who suffer from mental disorders, both of whom do very little reading on hard news coverage.</p>
<p>So, in the final analysis, it is independents and conservative leaning people who comprise the greater portion of newspaper readers, on the net or in newspaper print.</p>
<p>But, whatever the case, every large ultra liberal newspaper in the country is going under.  Check the web site, &#8220;newspaper deathwatch&#8221; to update your information.  </p>
<p>Why are the liberal yellow journalistic rags failing and a lot of the consevative ones, like the Washington Times, are doing fine?  Obviously it&rsquo;s because people are fed up with lying liberal rags.</p>
<p>Too, are you totally unaware that the biggies like the NYT, the LA Times, the Houston Chronicle, and the Chicago papers are all considered to be dependent on out of the area readers and advertisers?</p>
<p>Bottom line.  Brainwashed leftist dregs will get more and more scarce as the economy worsens, and they will be lucky if all they lose are their businesses.</p>
<p>As the economy goes, so goes the New World Order, the North American Union, the European Union, one world government, etc., and any leftist radical who believes his side should never let a good crisis go to waste is going to learn that this good crises isn&rsquo;t going to waste.  It&rsquo;s going to decimate the leftist ranks. </p>

		<p>So the chief wants his department to mirror his community. To be really representative of the &#8220;community&#8221; he might want to recruit from within the prison population, since it&rsquo;s so heavily black.</p>

		<p>Hiring or firing anybody because of the color of their skin and their race is against the discrimination laws of this country.  As far as I am concerned all those that are a part of the  Winston-Salem Police Department are breaking the law and should be fired or sued.  <br>
   Isn&rsquo;t it funny how those that are supposed to uphold the law are the greatest at breaking the law and it is worse in their case because they are supposed to know better. <br>
   Aside from breaking the law any idiot ( liberals ) knows that people should be hired because of their qualifications for that particular job, which is just common sense, but of course common sense is not in the liberal dictionary.<br>
    It&rsquo;s obvious ( to anybody with a brain! ) that the reason there is not many minorities in the Winston-Salem Police department is because they can&rsquo;t meet the basic requirements to be a police officer.  So eventually they will have to reduce the standards to near nothing like they have done throughout the whole country so people because of the color of their skin can get hired with no qualifications to do the job and plunge America further into the chaos it is already in.    </p>

		<p>I will be back to read everybody else&rsquo;s responses since I have to go to work, but trying to &#8220;mirror the community&#8221; sounds like an enormous waste of money.  Women generally are not attracted to police work due to the physical aggression required.  Blacks generally are not attracted to police work due to the criminal culture of the &#8220;black community.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>The Liberals have made great progress since the 1950&rsquo;s. Than they claimed that their goal was to stop discrimination against women and &#8220;men of colour&#8221;. &#8220;Select the best people for the job.&#8221; was their slogan; race, religion, gender, and ethnicity are irrelevant. Today, Liberals label such an attitude as Racist, Sexist, and/or Nativist. Liberals demand and achieve Diversity, which means discrimination against White men (at least the heterosexuals). </p>

		<p>The &#8220;lily white&#8221; Chief cunningham has had this &#8220;desire for diversity&#8221; disease before. On a town website, they proudly proclaim that in his last job as police chief in Cary NC, cunningham &#8220;enhanced community outreach and increased diversity within the ranks&#8221;. </p>
<p>He apparently wants fewer whites on his current Winston-Salem police force as well. The only way to achieve this goal is to remove some whites from the force and replace them with those wonder minorities that we all adore. Thats very big of the chief to request that whites sacrifice their jobs so minorities can have them. It must be lost on chief cuningham that he could resign on condition that he be replaced by a minority. That would increase diversity on the force chief. Or would you prefer that other whites make this sacrifice while you keep your job?</p>

		<p>Cunningham is known to be a pro-enforcement chief. There are few of these around. He replaced a VERY politically correct black female liberal chief. </p>
<p>With Winston-Salem&rsquo;s liberal politics, he is probably just saying what he feels he needs to say to get along. </p>
<p>When he was police chief in Cary, NC, he hired good officers. I have worked around Cary and have never seen a black Cary police officer. I am sure there are some, but he did NOT make Cary look like New Orleans.</p>

<p>Well!!! thanks for letting that little tidbit of knowledge slip out. NOW Cary will have to scramble for the much wanted minorities who, because of their value, will be able to demand athlete high salaries.</p>
