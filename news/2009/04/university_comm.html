<h1>University Community Reacts to Diversity Statistics From Committee</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cameron Feller, Cavalier Daily (University of Virginia), April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 2008-09 Honor Committee released statistics last week about the demographics of cases reviewed during its term. Although the data dealt specifically with cases reported, accused and brought to trial, the information also lends itself to several discussions about some students&rsquo; concerns pertaining to the University&rsquo;s honor system and diversity.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious areas of interest within the statistics were the numbers that dealt specifically with reporting. According to the statistics, a total of 64 cases were brought before the past Committee. Of these cases, 27 reports were brought against white students, 21 against black students, 11 against Asian and/or Asian-American students, four against Latinos and four against students of unknown race.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw [the statistics], I was a little bit surprised at the disproportionate number of minority students reported compared to [white] students,&#8221; said Vice Chair for Investigations Mary Siegel, a third-year College student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking at these numbers, there are almost as many [black] students reported as [white] students, which is not at all proportional [to the actual number of students enrolled at the University],&#8221; Siegel said.</p>
<p>These concerns with respect to reporting extend beyond just Committee members, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of data collection, I can&rsquo;t help but be startled by the discrepancy,&#8221; African-American Affairs Dean Maurice Apprey said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some members of the University attribute such statistical discrepancies to spotlighting, which is when certain minorities  &mdash;  such as blacks, athletes and Asians  &mdash;  are reported at a much higher rate than white students for reasons like standing out in the room more, as well as some reporters&rsquo; inherent biases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Siegel said she hopes to help explore the reasons behind allegedly biased reporting by speaking to reporters more frequently than the current system allows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the first place we have to start is reporters and ask them why they suspected this person of the Committee offense,&#8221; Siegel said. &#8220;If there seems to be a pattern, then the Committee can try and correct that pattern.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the statistics excluding last weekend&rsquo;s trials, 35 students were formally accused of committing an honor offense by the I-Panel, 13 of whom were black. Twelve white students were accused and 10 Asian and/or Asian-American students also were brought to trial. A total of 29 trials, including last weekend&rsquo;s trials, occurred during the past Committee&rsquo;s term. Of the 11 white students brought to trial, six were found not guilty, whereas 14 of the 19 black students brought to trial were found not guilty. A total of 32 males, meanwhile, were brought to trial, nine of whom were found guilty. Comparatively, four of the 11 female students brought to trial were found guilty.</p>
<p>After looking at the statistics, several Committee members said they believe that any bias present in the beginning of the honor trial process is lost during the process.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I challenge the notion that students of different color are on par with white students&#8221; after trials, Oronce said, noting that though Committee members have told him a &#8220;balance&#8221; eventually exists, his own data analysis yields different conclusions. He explained that his conclusions are based on a study done six years ago; the Committee has yet to do a similar study since.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s something like a 6 percent difference in guilt rate between [white] students and black students,&#8221; Oronce said. &#8220;Six percent comes off to me as a huge difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several members of the University community also have expressed concern about representation within the actual Committee itself in regards to diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you look at the Committee and support officer pools, they are admittedly not very diverse,&#8221; said Committee Chair David Truetzel, a third-year Commerce student. La Alianza Chair Carolina Ferrerosa, a fourth-year College student, agreed, noting that one of her organization&rsquo;s major concerns is increasing diversity within the Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to see more of a push&#8221; to get more minority representatives on the Committee, and make sure that &#8220;the Committee is realistic when it looks in the mirror,&#8221; Ferrerosa said.</p>
<p>Members and non-members alike hope that by increasing minority representation within the Committee, other diversity issues can be addressed, like increasing outreach and personal relationships between minority contracted independent organizations and the Committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you lack diversity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you don&rsquo;t have diversity of thought, diversity of ideas,&#8221; Truetzel said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boswell [BSA President-elect Boswell] said that first-year students in the black community often are approached by a lot of different programs focused on black students their first semester to create &#8220;a sense of family and place here&#8221; at the University. It is therefore sometimes difficult, however, to attract first-year students that are minorities within the Committee and other organizations during their first semesters, Boswell said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, there are still many things the Committee can do to encourage minorities to participate in the honor system, Boswell said. Even though the Committee attends The Source, the black community&rsquo;s activities fair, Boswell said she does not know if it is &#8220;the most effective way&#8221; to help recruitment.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re blaming the disparity on &#8220;spotlighting&#8221; minority students?  If anything, they&rsquo;re less likely to be punished for what they do, because they are minorities.</p>

			<p>  That makes as much sense as saying  &#8220;The USA population is 52% female so stands to reason that 52% of those in prison should be females as to fairly represent the population&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;When you lack diversity &hellip; you don&rsquo;t have diversity of thought, diversity of ideas,&rdquo; Truetzel said</p>
<p>So, everyone that looks the same automatically thinks the same.  No, no racism in that statement.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;When you lack diversity, you don&rsquo;t have a diversity of thoughts&hellip;&#8221;, blah, blah, blah!<br>
I worked in a research and development function for 40 yrs,where innovative thinking and novel approaches were the catalysts for many successful new products.  No question, &#8220;diversity of thoughts&#8221; was an essential stimulus for finding &#8220;the   <br>
big idea&#8221;. <br>
However, diversity of team members had absolutely nothing to do with any &#8220;diversity of thought&#8221; leading to any of the numerous billion-dollar new products we successfully introduced. On the contrary, we usually spent time waiting for the &#8220;rich cultural mosaic&#8221; to catchup.  No patents were ever issued to any one of the 30-odd blacks on our development teams.  No big ideas were ever attributed to any of them.  None ever contributed anything meaningful to any idea sessions I chaired. Was it just me?  Some left to go to other companies(black scientists were/are at a premium) and none of them ever did anything elsewhere either.</p>
<p>How do I know this?  I was the senior vice president of R&D; and I knew &#8216;em all.  My contacts in my industrry were at my level, and we all shared the same frustrations.<br>

I&rsquo;m sure that if the 27 &ldquo;white&rdquo; students accused of cheating showed up at the American Renaissance convention, many if not a majority would stand out and be judged many things, but WHITE would not be among them.</p>
<p>Because real Whites make up the overwhelming majority of the university and what passes for &ldquo;white&rdquo; is at best a jest, what we really see, is that Whites are under represented for honor code violations.</p>
<p>Whites have always had a higher sense of honor than other races.</p>

			<p>Stop everything.<br>
Assemble a special committee.<br>
Rework the statistics.<br>
Publish a report on the racism of reporters.<br>
Send them off to critical whiteness studies program and more intense diversity training.<br>
Through a couple of blacks on the panel, anyone will do.<br>
Apply for a grant to cover the costs</p>
<p>There, I think I&rsquo;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>Now, never mention these findings again.</p>

			<p>More than likely the blacks got off because the university did not want any sort of repercussions like lawsuits, riots or visits from Al $harpton or Je$$e Jack$son. </p>

			<p>Unmentioned in the discussion is the probability that because of affirmative action, more lower-qualified Blacks and Hispanics are admitted to the university.  Unable to compete fairly for grades,  they then cheat.  The problem is caused by the liberal administrators who admit minorities who are often woefully unqualified for university.  One of the consequences is the necessity for remedial courses, and the possibility of greater numbers of cheaters.  This is just one more horrible consequence of affirmative action.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM </p>

			<p>Committee Chair David Truetzel should look into the political affiliations of UVA faculty; I think he&rsquo;ll be surprised at how little &#8220;diversity of thought&#8221; finds expression there.</p>

			<p>I wonder how often infractions by black students are &#8220;overlooked&#8221; by sympathetic white faculty who know full well why they&rsquo;re there, and that they just aren&rsquo;t UVA material.  Is it any coincidence that the least qualified members of the student body are also the most likely to cheat?  What is the average black GPA at UVA?  You won&rsquo;t see that kind of the discussion in the article; yet, diversity on the Committee, presumably in hopes of getting more guilty blacks get acquitted, is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Like special tutoring in Math, etc. These are race based and ultimately taxpayer funded and are unconstitutional. Lots of white students can use special tutoring and &ldquo;a sense of family and place&rdquo;, but if you&rsquo;re a poor white, tough, if your the son of a wealthy black lawyer, well then you can get special attention.</p>

			<p>You have to wonder how many Cavalier readers deconstructed this story the way everyone commenting here did.<br>
1.  There are a lot of unqualified African-Americans at UVA who can&rsquo;t compete w/ their White peers.<br>
2.  AA culture condones cheating (how many educated Blacks are embarrassed by MLK&rsquo;s plagiarisms?)<br>
3.  The percentage of AA Honor Code violators is probably understated.  A lot of professors and students are happy to look the other way.<br>
4.  The Honor Committee has bent over backward to exonerate AA defendants.</p>
<p>And how many Cavalier readers were satisfied w/ the answer to the question the article raises  &mdash;  why is there such a high percentage of AA Honor Code violators? &#8220;Spotlighting?&#8221;  This was a new one for me.  Like the White kid craning his neck to look at someone else&rsquo;s exam or the notecard in his lap is less visible?  Most of the reporting by faculty is based on suspicious exams or papers.  They may not even know the student by sight.</p>
<p>And how many Cavs were happy with the solution:  persecute the &#8220;reporters&#8221; and lower the standards of the Committee?</p>
<p>The numbers in the article don&rsquo;t even add up:<br>
35 students were accused:  13 Blacks, 12 Whites, 10 Asians<br>
29 were brought to trial<br>
But these 29 included 19 Blacks, and 32 males and 11 females<br>
The Committee should think about &#8220;diversifying&#8221; by appointing a math or stat major.</p>
