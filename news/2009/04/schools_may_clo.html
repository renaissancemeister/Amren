			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Schools are closing for non-Christian religious festivals as well as Christmas and Easter to help curb absenteeism.</p>
<p>Growing numbers of councils are allowing schools to give pupils the day off to mark occasions such as Ramadan and the Hindu festival of Diwali.</p>
<p>Parents are legally entitled to take their children out of school for non-Christian festivals but end up missing lessons if the dates fall mid-term.</p>
<p>Now local authorities including Manchester, Oldham and Tower Hamlets in East London are granting schools permission to close for up to three days to cover holy days such as the Islamic festivals of Eid al Fitr and Eid ul Adha.</p>
<p>In guidance likely to be finalised in the summer, schools in some areas are being told they can consider closing for the day if 40 per cent of pupils are likely to be absent to observe a religious festival.</p>
<p>They must still offer 190 days teaching time so are scheduling staff training days to coincide with religious festivals or docking days from main holidays.</p>
<p>Figures for Manchester schools have shown a big rise in absences for &#8216;religious observance&rsquo; which accounts for almost one in ten of all missed days.<br>

			<p>they can consider closing for the day if 40 per cent of pupils are likely to be absent to observe a religious festival.</p>
<p>WOW!!! only muslims would do this, so the stated figure of 5% of the British population would now seem to be more like 40% or better, just like the black population in America is more like 45% instead of the oft quoted 10-12%</p>

			<p>Schools may close, to keep students from missing class? That&rsquo;s the headline? I must say I&rsquo;m not a friend to modern journalism or their causes, but clearly whoever wrote the headline was trying to inject a little humor into the day there.</p>

			<p>Undeniable benefit of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong here, public holidays abound - as we have all Western holidays, such as Xmas and Easter, and Chinese holidays.</p>

			<p>Want your civilization back white man? Close them all for good. We flourished for thousands of years without them. The schools are the antiwhite left&rsquo;s castle. Get busy</p>

			<p>They would not have done this for Jewish holidays. They are doing it only to appease the massive hordes of neck-slicers who are invading a formerly great country.</p>

<p>The weird thing about UK &#8220;populist&#8221; and &#8220;working class&#8221; and &#8220;conservative&#8221; papers like the Daily Mail, right now, is that they&rsquo;ll run article after article about the damage multicultural immigration is doing   &mdash;   and yet they still abide by the NUJ&rsquo;s dictum to mention the British National Party only negatively or not at all. The BNP is the ONLY party that even acknowledges the problems the Mail (et al) constantly complains about, let alone can offer sensible, pragmatic solutions to these problems. </p>
<p>The answer these Daily Mail writers are looking for is staring them in the face. The cognitive dissonance they&rsquo;re feeling must be intense. Too intense to be ignored much longer, I&rsquo;d guess. Pretty soon, some Fleet Street hack will crack and admit in print that they actually LIKE the BNP. </p>
<p>And then watch all hell break loose. </p>
<p>Earlier this week the Mail ran a plea by a Labour party Minister urging people to vote Conservative (sic) in the June EUros   &mdash;   just to thrwart the ascendent BNP! At the time I read this item, there were 125 comments   &mdash;   and 124 of them were either overtly pro-BNP or were at least passively approving, by saying things like &#8220;If the BNP does get in it&rsquo;ll be Labour&rsquo;s fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stay tuned, folks&hellip;</p>

			<p>It turns out that people can recognize a fast invasion like the one that took place on the beaches of France in 1944, but we can&rsquo;t recognize a slow motion invasion that takes place over the course of years.  </p>
