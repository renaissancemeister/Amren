<h1>Protesters Call for Reopening of Street</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathleen Hennessey, AP, April 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Protesters marched on the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday as they called for the reopening of a street described as a gateway into the city&rsquo;s historically black neighborhood.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 people chanted and waved signs urging city and state officials to tear down the wall that blocks off F Street as an entry point to West Las Vegas. The neighborhood has long been the heart of the black community and was home to city&rsquo;s black casino, The Moulin Rouge.</p>
<p>The street was closed in September as part of a highway widening project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think we&rsquo;re being segregated and redlined and that we&rsquo;re no longer included in progress in this city,&#8221; said Trish Geran, the chairwoman of Stop the F Street Closure.</p>
<p>Geran is among residents and activists who argue the closure isolates the black community from the rest of Las Vegas and stifles possible development in the area.</p>
<p>Her group and two residents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit seeking the immediate reopening of the street.</p>
<p>Las Vegas police Lt. Dan McGrath said officer estimated about 75 people rallied Saturday. The crowd chanted &#8220;No justice, no peace, reopen F Street!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;We think we&rsquo;re being segregated and redlined and that we&rsquo;re no longer included in progress in this city,&rdquo; said Trish Geran, the chairwoman of Stop the F Street Closure.</i></p>
<p>and then:</p>

<p>Why do you think you&rsquo;re &#8220;no longer included in the progress&#8221; of Las Vegas?  Because of BAMC attitudes like &#8220;no justice, no peace&#8221; and the implications of violence.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that they&rsquo;re not &#8220;no longer included in the progress&#8221; of Las Vegas.  It&rsquo;s just that the Hispanics have supplanted them.</p>

			<p>From the article: &#8220;Geran is among residents and activists who argue the closure isolates the black community from the rest of Las Vegas and stifles possible development in the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and when a developer finally comes in to develop the area, you will see blacks howling and screaming about the &#8220;injustice&#8221; of corporations and &#8220;racism&#8221;, of course! And they will pitch a fit about how they are being &#8220;driven&#8221; out of Las Vegas. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been to LV many, many times and I don&rsquo;t recall any &#8220;historically black&#8221; area of LV, historically biker, historically stripper, historically mafia but no black.</p>

<p>They had to do that, since they couldn&rsquo;t build a wall around the neighborhood which is so intense with crime and violence even the police are somewhat reluctant to go in there.</p>
<p>Along with the huge mestizo population, blacks have made Las Vegas a VERY dangerous place in areas that have few surveillance cameras.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip; a street described as a gateway into the city&rsquo;s historically black neighborhood.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Take note that these people can demand the government preserve and protect their &#8216;historically black neighborhood&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Just try asking your government to preserve your historically white neighborhood. Go on, try.</p>

			<p><i>The plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit have &#8220;failed to present any competent evidence that the F Street closure was motivated by discriminatory intent,&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Honestly now&hellip; can anybody reading this remember ANY time ANY black in the last 30 years or so has ever presented ANY kind of valid evidence of discrimination? These *people* just seem to be constantly seeking out some imaginary instance of &#8220;raysiss &#8216;scrimination&#8221; in hopes of hitting a lawsuit lottery. It&rsquo;s just extortion and we have to stand up to it and &#8220;Just Say No&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I drove by the demonstration on Saturday. They were huddled up in front of O&rsquo;Sheas&rsquo;s(right across the street from Caesars Palace). Nobody was paying any attention to them. I did notice 1 white man who was marching with the blacks. The traffic and street closures are getting ridiculous in this city. F Street has nothing to do about race though.</p>

			<p>As I sit in a public library printing this, just a few minutes ago there was a black kook was rambling and complaning and cursing about a whole lot of things, and he seemed to be very racial and bigoted, against Whitey. He complained to the librarian about a lot of things that she had nothing to do with. He said White folks this, White folks that,and he wiould call Barack Obama if anything bad happened to him. The police got him out of here before he did any real harm. I was ready to jump in if he laid a hand on the librarian, and I really would have taken care of him.It is just another reminder of how bigoted  and dangerous the black mindset can be</p>

<p>There can be a &#8220;historically black neighborhood&#8221;, but THEY are the victims of segregation? If so, then they are the victims of THEIR OWN SEGREGATION!</p>

			<p>Blacks whine about most everything and certainly will destroy practically anything when left to their own devices. This is why I along with most all of the people I know keep our contacts with them to a bare minimum. Life is just easier &amp; much safer maintaining this approach.</p>

			<p>I wonder, now that this street into &lsquo;historically black neighborhood&rsquo; has been closed, is there a drop in crime along the strip?</p>

			<p>Well it really is too bad that they would have to go one block south and west, or two blocks north to cross under the freeway.<br>
I have been watching this, In Lost Wages we have freeway bridges that drop chunks of concrete on to the street below, I would be glad if they were to close a death trap like that so near a park in my neighborhood. I would be willing to go a block out of my way to avoid shoddy construction hazards. Of course I can and do make my own way through life, I&rsquo;m not a &#8220;&#8221;victim&#8221;&#8220;.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see; this highway-widening project, a taxpayer-funded infrastructure improvement that will actually IMPROVE access to this neighborhood in the long run, is being met with protests of &#8220;racism&#8221;?  The ability of these folks to conjure up the dark forces of &#8220;racism&#8221; on demand, anywhere they want is simply beyond belief.</p>

			<p>Blacks blame Whitey for not doing enough about crime in their neighborhoods, but then want only the most royal treatment of the thugs that are victimizing them. They will also complain whenever any kind of change is being made, might be made or is even discussed. </p>
<p>If F Street is closed, they will agitate to benefit in some way from its closing, just as they agitate now against its closing. Blacks are certain of only one thing: Whatever happens, they stand to benefit. If F Street were to stay, they would demand an infusion of tax money (handouts) to foster the development of this black paradise. No concrete benefits would need to be demonstrated since no one really believes that this would be money well spent. </p>
