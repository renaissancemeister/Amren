<h1>Yamato Workers Freed As Immigration Probe Continues Into Bellingham Company</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Stark, Bellingham (Washington) Herald, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many if not all workers detained in the Feb. 24 immigration raid at Yamato Engine Specialists have been released from the federal detention center in Tacoma.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that many of the individuals .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;. have indeed been released pending the further investigation of Yamato Engine,&#8221; said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lorie Dankers.</p>
<p>Besides their freedom, the workers also have permission to look for work.</p>
<p>The workers have been given a document advising them &#8220;that per the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to this case, all persons involved with the Yamato Engine Specialists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should be afforded the benefit of Deferred Action and an Employment Authorization Document, valid for the duration of this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The workers also have the option of declining the release and work permit offer and returning to their home country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Barack Obama and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, have indicated they want to shift immigration enforcement policy away from workplace raids that target workers, cracking down instead on the employers who hire those workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE officers arrested 28 workers in last month&rsquo;s raid. Three were women who were released later in the day to care for their children, pending a hearing on their immigration status. Guillen said two others have already been deported, but all of the rest have now been released.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Guillen said the freeing of workers was surprising, because those detained in immigration raids can expect to be jailed for months to await a hearing, unless they can post large amounts of bail or are willing to accept immediate return to their homelands.</p>
<p>While the release of the workers is a welcome development, Guillen also expressed concern that the workers are being confronted with complex legal decisions about the consequences of cooperating in a federal investigation, without having lawyers to represent them. She said the workers have been told to expect further questioning from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p>

			<p>This is where my logic of a couple of days ago is going awry.  If HLS goes after the employers and neither prosecutes nor gives virtual amnesty to the illegal workers, then it will mean that there is no incentive to hire illegal workers.  But since they&rsquo;re giving virtual amnesty to the illegal workers, they will remain here and therefore remain a temptation for other employers to hire them.  And drive wages down.</p>

Okay three of them had kids, just stop on the way out of town with the rest of them and pick up the kids as you go. If their mothers are illegal, the children should be declared illegal too, until they turn 18 and can contest the ruling  &mdash;  after Mexico picks up the tab for their education and medical care. I really cannot see the reasoning behind why this would be so hard to do. Simply repeal the automatic, anchor baby ammendment.  </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of what I pointed out a couple of days ago when an article told of what was an obvious pretense to go after employers instead of the illegals themselves, which, of course, they will not do.  It&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
<p>Headline: &#8220;DHS shifting focus from illegals to the employers that hire them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ranger:  &#8220;That&rsquo;s absolutely false. Pretending to be going after employers is an obvious ruse to make it appear as if nothing has changed, only the targets, which will deflect howls of protest from the 79% of the population that want these illegals out of the country. Almost all enforcement of illegal aliens has now STOPPED. The next step is universal amnesty for them and their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be NO persecutions of employers who hire illegals.  Amnesty is here.  The only people who will be given any grief for being in this country illegally, will be whites.</p>
<p>Sorry, but that&rsquo;s a fact we might as well deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad, however.  By invoking this policy, the radical leftists are causing the country to more rapidly disintegrate economically, and eventually, riotously, if they had removed them all.</p>
<p>This continuing collapse will correct a lot of wrongs.  Don&rsquo;t allow an uptick now and then to divert your concentration of the big picture, and it is still telling us the economy is continuing to crash.  A few days increase in the stock market means nothing compared to another monthly loss of well over 700,000 jobs.  The game is over.</p>

Does that mean this government will be arresting and charging the owners of this company? And when are the American citizens who are out of work going to start picketing and boycotting these companies</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this give illegal workers an incentive to turn in their employers?</p>

			<p>Who are they kidding!  There is nothing to indicate there is any intention to enforce US founding immigration laws because the benefits to DNC are more beneficial everyday they enter and reproduce. This is fraud to all American taxpayers of which there are fewer and fewer while the entitlement state advances in size and power. Our President/Congress are in violation of office because they are not protecting US from foreign interests.<br>
The end game is when there are no longer taxpayers to support it.</p>
