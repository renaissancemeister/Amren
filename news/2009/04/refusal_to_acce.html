<h1>Refusal to Accept Reality is Killing Detroit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rochelle Riley, Detroit Free Press, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit&rsquo;s fantasy will be its downfall.</p>
<p>Many residents and elected officials think the city cannot only survive but look the way it did 50 years ago by the sheer force of their will and ignorant audacity. They appear unaware of the economic crisis that the rest of America is struggling to survive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School board members let politics keep them from telling parents they cannot keep open schools that hold a fifth of the population for which they were built.</p>
<p>Some council members are watching the city die before our eyes, but this out-of-step, out-of-date faction is too busy finding insult in every offer of help, threats in every suggestion to share responsibility. They&rsquo;d rather see the city die than relinquish what matters more to them than survival  &mdash;  power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about power</p>
<p>The City Council&rsquo;s motives are clear. A majority is fighting to maintain sole control of the Cobo convention center, even if it means losing the North American International Auto Show and other events that would bring much-needed money into Detroit.</p>
<p>Worried that the regional Cobo authority embraced by nearly all other elected officials might cut into their power, this slim majority has decided not to share. They would rather the hall sit dilapidated and empty  &mdash;  and lose the auto show  &mdash;  than to admit that a city $300 million in debt might need help.</p>
<p>The school board&rsquo;s motives are clear. Detroit Public Schools&rsquo; emergency financial manager, Robert Bobb, the new sheriff in town, quickly determined that the district has more school buildings than students to fill them and proposed closing some to pare down the district&rsquo;s $300-million-plus deficit. Bobb plans to close 23 schools that were built for 19,275 students but currently hold only 7,095.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit, as it once was, does not exist. DPS, as it once was, does not exist.</p>
<p>And the new Detroit that is struggling to meet its needs is getting no help from many of its residents and too many of its leaders.</p>
<p>We need to see Detroit as it is.</p>
<p>Detroit wants neighborhood schools in neighborhoods where it can no longer afford to provide service.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m originally from the Detroit area myself.  I heard that back in the 70s Detroit school principals were behind bulletproof glass.</p>
<p>I live in Ohio, and when I go to the Detroit suburbs to see my mother, I don&rsquo;t like to take I-75 straight through Detroit.  I prefer to take I-275 to I-696 and go around it.  A bit out of the way, but worth it.</p>

			<p>Readers should note that this article is from the Detroit Free Press, a daily paper that&rsquo;s the ultimate in liberal birdcage liners. </p>
<p>For decades the &#8220;Freep&#8221;, as it&rsquo;s referred to here, has defended every liberal idea and spending plan the Detroit city clowns-in-charge threw out, and woe be unto any critic from the suburbs. The latter would instantly be labled &#8220;racist&#8221;. If the critic was black, he or she would be called an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221;, an &#8220;Aunt Jemima, or an &#8220;oreo&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whenever a new, (always) black, garishly-clad politician takes any office in that third world dump, the Freep trumpets &#8220;new ideas!&#8221; and &#8220;talent&#8221; are about to &#8220;lead Detroit in a new direction!&#8221;.  This shameless pandering has gone on for years while the city has continued its slide into political corruption, incompetence and mediocrity. Now it prints this article.  Well Gee Whiz!</p>
<p>The Detroit News, the other daily which used to be somewhat conservative, occasionally writes about the latest city council meeting where the peacock-strutting dandies on the board bicker like school children, and nothing gets done. Often they have to close their meetings early due to their chronic arguing. </p>
<p>I had to go to Detroit&rsquo;s downtown a few weeks ago on business, the first time I had been down there in years, and it was worse than I had ever seen it. A small business was in its death throes, and I was called to help determine if they had any chance of survival. It doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Although freezing cold, the empty buildings that comprise most of downtown still had their raggety black panhandlers out on the front sidewalks hassling any passerby. Trash blew across the streets while the bums were working same, and there was not a city worker or cop in sight. </p>
<p>I give DIEtroit another 3 years before it becomes completely dead. Blacks have governed the city for the past 40 plus years, and the result today is the best of their &#8220;thinking&#8221;. I wonder if the Freep will admit to its part of the destruction.</p>
<p>To a race of people that are obviously devoid of personal shame, all of the above means nothing, however.    </p>

Detroit is on deathwatch. No people, no money, no future. Its bonds are rated as &#8220;junk,&#8221; its mean price of a house sold was $7,500 recently, and it keeps losing people. One of its former biggest employers, GM, is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It is probably going to be one of the big headline &#8216;crisis&rsquo; stories of the next twelve months, followed by the state of California.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Columnist: Detroit&rsquo;s leaders still think it is 1950.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s debatable, because with minds that are on such a low level it&rsquo;s difficult determining if they think anything at all in rational terms.</p>
<p>If blacks are viewed as children, which they are regarding mentality, emotional make-up, and capability, then everything they do and say isn&rsquo;t really a surprise</p>
<p>And like children, we must pretend they are really proficient at things so they won&rsquo;t get mad and riot.</p>
<p>But how much longer can we keep playing this game without bringing ourselves down with them?<br>

			<p>coleman a young, the first &#8220;black&#8221; mayor of detroit was instrumental in destroying a once great city.  Now they blame the &#8220;age&#8221; of the infrastructure for making it difficult to &#8220;rebuild&#8221;.  coleman a young drove whites out by his constant harping about the &#8220;racists&#8221; who were trying to take the city away from blacks.<br>
One only has to look at satellite images of detroit to see what a wasteland it is.<br>
By the way, Detroit STILL has the best water quality of any large municipal water system.</p>

			<p>I saw on FOX News this evening an article about a number of areas around ChiCONGO attempting to secede from the county in which ChiCONGO garners all the taxes from. One city mayor says they pay ChiCONGO 18million a year in taxes and get back only 4mil in services. I hope they are able to do so. I think the muslims in all of Michiganistan will soon stop sending all of their taxes into Detroit too, unless all the blacks there convert to muslim.</p>

			<p>Ice, as you so accurately said:</p>
<p>&#8220;And like children, we must pretend they are really proficient at things so they won&rsquo;t get mad and riot. But how much longer can we keep playing this game without bringing ourselves down with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Placating blacks is a national pasttime here in the good old U.S. of A, right up there with baseball. &#8220;Playing pretend&#8221; regarding their abilities has killed so many cities along with Detroit, and the state and federal taxes continue to finance the insanity.</p>
<p>Everytime blacks riot when something doesn&rsquo;t go their way be it an expected entitlement, a government handout, a jury decision they don&rsquo;t agree with, or when one of their beloved thugs gets popped by the police, the black &#8220;academics&#8221; and victicrats come crawling out of the woodwork to blame whites and &#8220;the system&#8221;. Liberal whites harumph and nod in serious agreement. </p>
<p>Then the tax money pours in again for a few more years only to disappear with nothing accomplished, and the problems in black cities growing worse than ever.</p>
<p>The black power potentates in Detroit are openly racist when it comes to white involvement or input. They want to demonstrate to their willfully ignorant black serfs in the city that they&rsquo;re &#8220;authentically black&#8221; and &#8220;down wit da struggle&#8221;. </p>
<p>Millions of dollars for new charter schools were recently refused by a majority on the city council, money that was to be donated by a private individual, a white multi-millionaire, because they angrily saw it as White encroachment into their turf. In the city dailies, members of the city council said that &#8220;whites were trying to steal the minds of their children&#8221; with the free money.</p>
<p>Within the next few years, look for more marches by blacks to include a few riots thrown in when Detroit gasps its last. The survivors, see also black predators and their mommas, have already begun the final exodus by taking their section 8 vouchers and heading for the surrounding suburbs. </p>
<p>The process of continued destruction has begun again in those areas to include Oak Park, Eastpointe, and Southfield. Those suburbs are now majority black, crime has ballooned, and the home values have fallen far below the rest of the state.  </p>
<p>And Detroit&rsquo;s news outlets will continue to trumpet black folk&rsquo;s &#8220;new and bold direction!&#8221; </p>
<p>The insanity of placating blacks will not end until we&rsquo;re all under fire and burying our children due to drive-bys.  Wait until you see this becomes the norm with illegal Mexicans. The state of the country will be almost surreal by then in its terrifying condition.       </p>

			<p>      We should take a cue from one of the ancient pharoahs.<br>
He barred all Blacks past one of the cataracts. If subsequent<br>
pharoahs had continued his policy, Ancient Egypt might never<br>
have died. Ridiculous? Not at all: China is just as old but still<br>
the same Culture because still the same Race. <br>
      No Blacks past the Eight Mile crosswise or past the third<br>
mile (cataract) lenghtwise. The penalty will be to be locked up<br>
and forced to listen to White Rappers like Vanilla Ice and Eminem.</p>

			<p>In 1950 Detroit had 1.8 million souls and was a vibrant city. Anonymous has it exactly right   &mdash;   Coleman Young was elected in a flurry of racial excitement as he set about to make Detroit black. Young carped about suburban racists abandoning the city at the same time he was forcing whites out. What a fool! </p>
<p>But this is a good lesson for us today. Watch as another racist takes the reins of power and tries to guide us into a post-racial consciousness. Blacks will never condemn Young for destroying Detroit as they will not tolerate a bad word about their new homeboy. Watch as Juan Williams ties himself in knots trying to justify that which is unjustifiable.</p>

			<p>When Detroit comes up, I mention the political problems of diversity: it creates an internal power struggle. I never have to mention race. Just the idea that different groups are in conflict tells everyone all they need to know   &mdash;   like every dying empire, its people fall into bickering amongst themselves, and so they ignore reality and get destroyed.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good way to subvert liberal thought. Race isn&rsquo;t the problem; not having everyone going in the same direction is the problem. Diversity can exist in many forms   &mdash;   race, religion, philosophy, intelligence   &mdash;   and each one of them undermines civilization.</p>

			<p>Big Steve at once tells us that a &#8220;racist&#8221; is going to take power and &#8220;guide us into a post-racial consciousness&#8221; makes as much sense as Liberal fairy dust.  Perhaps just once when a liberal spouts out an inanity someone, anyone ask them what they mean with strict definitions so the sane and logical can decipher it.  What does &#8220;racist&#8221; mean and what is a &#8220;post racial consciouness&#8221; mean?</p>

I went to the original article to read it in full and to see if I could make sense of what this writer was talking about.</p>
<p>I googled the author and found this:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;One of the top young African-American journalists in the United States, Rochelle Riley received several awards for her nationally syndicated columns in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This confirmed what I had suspected from reading this standard black logic and black writing style.</p>
<p>The logic and reasoning of the black mind is a wonder. No coherent understanding of the issue or underlying causes.</p>
<p>While this American-African woman is aware of dysfunction, she can&rsquo;t grasp the cause: African control of Detroit.</p>
<p>Africans, no matter where they are in the world, run their communities as African tribes run by dictatorial chieftains. It&rsquo;s the only way they know how to run their societies. The end results are the same. Detroit, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Congo, and on and on.</p>
<p>Africans can&rsquo;t live by White western standards. They simply can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why they fail in White societies. What&rsquo;s even worse, when they try to run things the African way, everything, and I do mean everything, falls apart.</p>
<p>The reality is that blacks can&rsquo;t function in White societies and they can&rsquo;t maintain their own. There is no answer because they refuse to let White people run things and they can&rsquo;t run things themselves.</p>

			<p>Today, we witness the complete collapse of Detroit, soon to be followed by Baltimore and D.C.  But this is just the beginning.  Blacks and hispanics are growing in numbers and political power.  Their influence and control is spreading; now, they are doing to entire States what they have done to cities like Detroit.  Next, we&rsquo;ll witness the complete collapse of California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey due to the havoc and incompetence wrought by minorities. America continues its descent into second world status.  By the 22nd Century, America will resemble today&rsquo;s Venezuela or South Africa.  It will be a ghost of its former glory.  </p>

<p>Yes, that was the first &#8220;Blacks not allowed sign in history.&#8221; </p>
<p>Egypt brutally crushed the blacks several times and one instance took 70,000 survivors of one wartime battle as slaves.</p>
<p>I wonder why we never hear any of this from Calypso Louie or the other black racists?  Blacks were slaves not masters of Egypt.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the ancient Egyptian era when it was no longer more than a burnt out country, failing and filled with riff raff, a mulatto or two was probably a pharoah.</p>
<p>Of course that would be like saying 1000 years from now that America was founded and built by blacks, because, as they were collapsing economically, a mulatto was president.<br>

			<p>Even the Liberal white kids do not want to move to Detroit or any other &#8220;Black&#8221; city.  Of course conservatives are too polite to ask them specifically why not.  So if there are any liberals here maybe they can tell us why they would move there or what excuses they have for not moving there? (besides the economy)</p>

<p>I grew up on &#8220;County Line Road&#8221;, that&rsquo;s the road that separates Chicago dominated Cook county Ill from conservative white dominated suburban and rural Lake County Ill.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my parents bought the land and built our home on the Lake County side of County Line Road, thus escaping both high taxes and the disfunctional and corrupt Cook county officials and employees.</p>
<p>There are a lot of restaurants and small businesses right on the dividing lines around Cook County.  That way they get Cook County customers avoiding the high Cook County sales and other taxes.<br>

<p>True, BUT as we in the U.S. have learned, the same thing has happened to Egypt that is HAPPENING to us. Egypt is hard to tell from the CONGO now as most &#8216;egyptians&rsquo; appear to be black. White race GONE, blacks running everything into the ground!! sound familiar?</p>

			<p>To &#8220;q&#8221; and SKIP above.  I recently stumbled upon this anthropology blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/category/ancient-egypt/page/3/" rel="nofollow">https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/category/ancient-egypt/page/3/</a></p>
<p>&hellip;and it is excellent reading for anybody interested in the racial makeup of the ancient Egyptians.  She comes down hard on the afro-centrists - but also on the euro-centrists - and her opinions are based on cold, hard science.  There is a comment section so you may (politely) voice your reasoned disagreements (or agree, whatever the case).  There are also many cool mummy photos for anybody who enjoys that sort of thing.  Like other civilizations, Egypt was keen on defense of the Mummy-land.</p>

			<p>When will European Americans stop running and take a stand in this, the country built by the brains, brawn, and work ethic of our forefathers? City after city, county after county, school district after district, the story is the same: once it reaches the racial tipping point, kiss civilized Western standards (and the public schools) goodbye.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the ascendant liberal orthodoxy of contemporary American &amp; Western Society, which is still predominantly white and which celebrates virtually every other form of racial or ethnic consciousness, has labeled white racial consciousness a hate crime.</p>
<p>&#8216;sbuffalonative&rsquo; hits the nail on the head with his 11:11 April 11 post. I only hope &#8216;proactive&rsquo; is right and that there is some limit to what whites will tolerate in &#8216;placating blacks&rsquo; - endlessly kissing their rear-ends (excusing sub-civilized behavior), while subsidizing their inability to exercise adult responsibilities. But it&rsquo;s so very sad that it may take too many of us burying our own children. Shame on us.<br>

			<p>      I read an artilce about an old Black man who grew up down<br>
South who now hunts racoons in the wilds of Detroit. Not only is<br>
he feeding himself, he is selling the meat. Who says Blacks lack<br>
an entrepeneurial spirit? They just need a simple lifestyle away<br>
from Whites. I can see a future where a hundred thousand or so<br>
live a traditional life in the Deep South and Mississipi Delta.<br>
The rest? They&rsquo;ll be gone. We wont hurt them, but we wont save<br>
them either. We wont be able to even if we wanted to-we&rsquo;re going<br>
to be hard pressed ourselves. It just like New Orleans: the gov-<br>
erment didn&rsquo;t build it, why should it (us) rebuild it? And again,<br>
we don&rsquo;t have the money anyway so it&rsquo;s a moot point except to us<br>
philosophers who take the principle and run with it.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a reason so many blacks came to Detriot  &mdash;  -GM,  Ford, et al, wanted cheap workers, and it eventually killed them.  If Boeing had imported tons of blacks to build planes, Seattle would have been killed just like Detroit.  It&rsquo;s just that simple.  The car industry brought the cancer into the their city, and it eventually killed it. </p>

			<p>I have just re-read AMREN archive August 1991, Vol 2, No.8. &#8216;The late great city of Detroit&rsquo;. It is almost impossible to believe that the black riots in 1967 were so bad that the 101st and 82nd Airbourne were sent in to restore order. This is recommended reading, and should be mandatory. This comes from an Englishman who has never set foot in USA but a big fan of &#8216;The Wire&rsquo; True.</p>

To &ldquo;q&rdquo; and SKIP above. I recently stumbled upon this anthropology blog:<br>
<a href="https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/category/ancient-egypt/page/3/" rel="nofollow">https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/category/ancient-egypt/page/3/</a></p>
<p>An excellent article, thanks for the link. Too, exactly the conditions I see in the middle east in my association/working relationships with the Arabs, to include Egyptians.<br>

			<p>There is a simple solution. <br>
&#8220;<br>
• 1 of 3 California students attends an overcrowded school.<br>
• California has more students per class than any state except Utah.<br>
• Overcrowded California schools enroll up to 5 times the number of students they were built to serve. 4200 students attend South Gate Middle School in Los Angeles &mdash; a school designed for 800.<br>
• Most students in overcrowded schools are Latino and still learning<br>
English; most overcrowded schools are in poor neighborhoods.<br>
• By 2009, California will need schools for 1 million more students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just bus students in from California. The flight from California to Detroit is not much longer than the time some kids spend being bussed.<br>

			<p>There was a Time Magazine article about Detroit earlier this year that said exactly what this article does.  The city leadership not only thinks it can return Detroit to where it was 50 years ago, but they don&rsquo;t understand that even a future as a smaller, but still prosperous city requires the return of a white middle class that were given very good reasons for leaving in droves when they did.</p>

			<p>Detroit is about 88% black. No city in the world can have such a high percentage of blacks and be ANYTHING OTHER then a complete and total catastrophe. Tell me any city ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD as black (or more black) as Detroit that is NOT a disaster.</p>
