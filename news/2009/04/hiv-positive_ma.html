<h1><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/614215">HIV-Positive Man Killed With Hatred</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosie DiManno, Toronto Star, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When he wasn&rsquo;t busy fornicating them to death, Johnson Aziga must have hated women.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the former Ontario civil servant was entirely indifferent to females, without feeling or conscience as he introduced a silent killer  &mdash;  cloaked in lust  &mdash;  into their lives.</p>
<p>Dishonest and duplicitous, thinking only of his immediate sexual gratification, the 52-year-old knowingly and intentionally exposed his unsuspecting lovers to the HIV virus right up until the morning of his arrest on Aug. 30, 2003.</p>
<p>He cut a wide swath with his penis.</p>
<p>On Saturday, after deliberating for three days, a Hamilton jury found Aziga guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of attempted aggravated sexual assault.</p>
<p>It was a historic verdict: The first time in Canada  &mdash;  or anywhere in the world, as far as the prosecution is aware  &mdash;  that a criminal case involving the reckless transmission of HIV has resulted in a murder conviction.</p>
<p>Deliberate, without prophylactic protection, done in full awareness that infection of others might result, withholding his HIV-positive status and repeatedly denying his condition to sexual partners who inquired.</p>
<p>Two of those women subsequently died from AIDS-related lymphoma, their videotaped testimony  &mdash;  given shortly before they passed away  &mdash;  played for the jury.</p>
<p>Five other women have tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Four more women have tested negative. But it&rsquo;s still aggravated sexual assault because, as the Crown successfully argued, valid consent cannot be given when information about a partner&rsquo;s diagnosed HIV-positive status has been withheld.</p>
<p>There is an obligation, legally and morally, to disclose.</p>
<p>Aziga did not tell and, further, denied it when directly quizzed by girlfriends who were persuaded to cease using condoms.</p>
<p>All the while, Aziga was receiving antiretroviral therapy to control the advance of his illness. Early detection is crucial for treatment of HIV, modern drugs now extremely effective as intervention, such that the virus is no longer a looming death sentence.</p>
<p>Aziga never gave his many lovers that benefit. He, however, appears perfectly healthy, continuing his drug regimen through the nearly six years thus far spent in custody.</p>
<p>Now, he will likely die in prison: First-degree murder means a mandatory life sentence, with no parole eligibility for 25 years.</p>
<p>The trial took five years to come to court, Aziga firing several lawyers along the way, and six months to conclude. Aziga never did take the stand in his own defence. But he&rsquo;d hardly been a mute defendant. Superior Court Justice Thomas Lofchik allowed the separated father of three to indulge in oratory during earlier phases of the judicial proceeding, which could not be reported at the time.</p>
<p>In late 2006, Aziga  &mdash;  who often scoured legal textbooks in court  &mdash;  mounted his own arguments in opposition to the criminalizing of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an issue in which it takes two to tango, the sex issue,&#8221; he expounded. &#8220;Somebody may be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fraudulent and so mean, but it takes two. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, some people are being reported dead.&nbsp;.&nsbp;.&nbsp;. As I said, this is a statement of frustration, not necessarily of anger, especially when you see the exercise that is going on. When we are talking about somebody dying, trying to see whether it should be accepted (as evidence) or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shockingly, there are some AIDS activists who support the view that HIV-positive individuals have no obligation to reveal their status to sexual partners; that everyone is responsible for taking their own precautions. One school of thought contends that criminalizing even reckless behaviour will discourage people from being tested for HIV as a pre-emptive legal defence: They didn&rsquo;t know they were infected, so can&rsquo;t be held accountable for passing on the virus.</p>
<p>Aziga was diagnosed with HIV in 1996. He received counselling from medical staff on both safe sex practices and his legal obligation to disclose positive status to sexual partners. Fully educated about the virus, Aziga nevertheless continued his reckless behaviour before and after separating from his wife. Twice he was issued with orders under the Health Protection and Promotion Act to abstain from sex involving penile penetration unless he disclosed his HIV and wore a latex condom &#8220;from onset of erection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following his arrest  &mdash;  his photo circulated in the media  &mdash;  several other women came forward to lodge complaints with police. In the end, there were 13 complainants, though two were dropped en route to trial.</p>
<p>The Crown presented evidence that all the women contracted an HIV strain from a shared source, a strain rare in North America but common in areas of Africa. Aziga hails from Uganda.</p>
<p>He liked his women white, plain, even homely and probably lonely. They were co-workers, single-mom neighbours and ladies picked up in bars.</p>
<p>Of course, to make love is not necessarily to like and clearly not to give a damn.</p>

			<p>The second to last paragraph admits that race was a motivation (probably THE motivation), but this article spends most of its words going on and on about gender, about his misogyny.  That might be true, but where were his black women victims?  </p>

			<p>What a wonderful culture of equality and acceptance!  All those homely, lonely &#8216;ladies&rsquo;, embracing the richness Aziga&rsquo;s diversity.  And all of it voluntary.</p>
<p>In these parts, lots of white women pick up venereal diseases from black men.  But they have to be abducted and raped, first.</p>
<p>As to the assertion that Aziga &#8220;preferred&#8221; women really pitiful white women&hellip;&hellip;well, POOH!  Even in Canada, &#8216;marginal&rsquo; females are the best he could hope for.  I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d try for Pamela Anderson if he had the chance.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Canadians, the same thing happens in New Zealand too!</p>
<p>(Yes, down to the race of both parties)</p>

			<p>I clicked on the link to read the full story on the Toronto &#8220;Red&#8221; Star, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that on many newspapers webpages any stories like this where whites are victims of nonwhites, readers don&rsquo;t have the option of posting comments.</p>

			<p>The average black person probably believes if enough white people get HIV the government will make a greater effort to cure it. There is nothing that is not a political act for these people. Stupidity has developed into a legitimate science.</p>
<p>HIV is a serious problem. The media coverage, though, is always about &#8216;new infection rates&rsquo;.</p>
<p>600,000 Americans have actually died AIDS. Why do we never, ever, learn the race of those who died?  </p>

			<p>I do not understand. Why would so many White women sleep with such a ugly, evil and obnoxious man? Do these women not have any taste? There have been many such cases in laces such as Australia and Poland where several White women have slept with ugly, cheating HIV positive black guys. Never made any sense to me.</p>

<p>This is an evil psychopath. It has nothing to do with two people having sex, it has to do with him having AIDS and deliberately not telling women and  knowingly and deliberately spreading the disease.</p>
<p>PS- After looking at his picture, one would have to be really hard up to sleep with him. Yuck!!!!</p>

			<p>Some background on Aziga:</p>
<p>At the time of his arrest on Aug. 30, 2003, the native of Uganda was employed as a research and evaluation analyst with the business planning and research division of the Ministry of the Ontario Attorney General.  Ontario Government agencies go out of their way to hire non-whites as part of affirmative action, to diversify the workplace.  This policy gave Aziga the economic opportunity and status to lure his victims.</p>
<p>To ad injury to insult, thje recent immigrant imposed financial burdens on his adopted country: during his incarceration, he fired several lawyers and relied on Ontario Legal Aid to pay his legal bills. But after funding four previous defence teams, the financially strapped agency refused to give him any more money. His trial was rescheduled for a fifth time, and the Ministry of the Attorney General, his old employer, agreed to pay his fees to get the trial over with.</p>
<p>He was the second AIDS murderer from Uganda to infect victims in Canada, the first being Charles Ssenyonga, an immigrant who did his crimes in the late 1980&rsquo;s to early 1990&rsquo;s.  </p>

			<p>This story is written in such a bizarre way. It&rsquo;s about as far from &#8216;news&rsquo; as it could possibly be. It&rsquo;s like a harlequin romance, except that it contradicts itself so much. I truly wonder if the reporter, and Johnson Aziga the perp, would make a good match for each other. </p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s the possibility this is really at it&rsquo;s heart a political act. People like this feel that if enough whites get AIDs, those in power will take bolder steps to a cure. This is exactly the way these people live and think. Every word and personal action is a political statement. All for a good cause of course. They&rsquo;ve been allowed to get away with it without remorse. This is exactly how most liberals live their lives.  </p>

			<p> The psychopathic personality can be a smart and sexually beguiling one.  He didn&rsquo;t &#8220;hate&#8221; women as the smarty-pants author would have you believe (&#8220;his many lovers&#8221; indeed). He simply ejaculated into them and forgot about them when he was through. He simply didn&rsquo;t give a rip either way.<br>
 As for the political angle, maybe. Psychopaths can be cunning in the extreme and even though their calculations can be greatly erroneous ( see Hitler and the lebensraum idea) their energies can be highly focused; after all, they have no moral anxieties.<br>

<p>&gt; I know from experience that the way liberal women tend to spend their time sexually is through a trivialized view of sex partners and the absense of fathers except as cash cows - if they need it.  This allows them to be played for suckers by men they see as &#8220;exotic&#8221; as opposed to the boring, White Bread guys they grew up with - examples of whom post here regularly.  Well, at least these liberated women aren&rsquo;t bored any longer - funny how risk and terminal illness wakes one up.  They will also have the solace of having done their part in advancing People of Color in the world.</p>

			<p>Of course Canadian taxpayers will pay for his expensive treatments as well as his legal expenses. Why not ship him back to Uganda? As a matter of fact, why was he even let into the country. Immigration can kill.</p>
<p>Ps- I too don&rsquo;t think he hated women. I just think he was a sociopath devoid of all conscience who wanted sex and didn&rsquo;t tell his HIV status because if he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t get sex.</p>

			<p>Oh man and he is 52 years old!!  This was never on TV, and the only explanation I have is the women she infected are around same age as he, and all of them are homely.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Shockingly, there are some AIDS activists who support the view that HIV-positive individuals have no obligation to reveal their status to sexual partners; that everyone is responsible for taking their own precaution.&#8221; </p>

<p>Then make it a legal requirement for everyone to be tested!! </p>
<p>and the Toronto Star website does not have a picture of him posted.  Let me assure you, it is impossible for such a well-known media company like the Toronto Star not to have a picture of him available, especially during days like today with such advanced technologies.</p>
