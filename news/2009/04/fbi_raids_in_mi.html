<h1>FBI Raids in Minn. Aimed at Africa Money Transfers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Forliti, AP, April 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal agents searched three money-transfer businesses in Minneapolis on Wednesday, carrying away boxes of documents and copying computer hard drives for details of transactions between the U.S. and several African nations.</p>
<p>Agents searched Mustaqbal Express, also known as North American Money Transfer Inc.; Quran Express; and Aaran Financial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A copy of a search warrant executed at Mustaqbal Express and obtained by The Associated Press said authorities were looking for documents, books, records, ledgers and other materials &#8220;relating to the transfer of money, currency or funds&#8221; to Somalia, Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and the United Arab Emirates. It also sought documents on ownership and management of the business and lists of clients. It covered materials from January 2007 to the present.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abdirahman Omar, the general manager of Mustaqbal Express, said about 15 agents spent more than four hours at his business. He said they took about 10 boxes of documents and copied computer hard drives.</p>
<p>Mustaqbal Express&rsquo; Minneapolis office serves as a central collection point for money from other locations around the country, including Seattle, St. Louis and Denver and Columbus, Ohio, Omar said  &mdash;  from $1 million to $1.5 million per month. The office then ships it overseas, mostly to Somalia.</p>
<p>Omar said the service is especially important because it is one of the few ways Somalis can send money back home. He added that he was angered by the raid, saying it gave his business a bad image.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minnesota is home to a large concentration of African immigrants, particularly Somalis who have mostly settled in Minneapolis. The most recent U.S. Census figures estimate the state has about 32,300 Somalis.</p>
<p>The two other money-transfer businesses were in another location, known as the Karmel Mall. Several people and shopowners declined to be quoted, but said a dozen or so federal agents were at the mall from about 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.</p>

			<p>So, the government taxes you, uses the money to import tens of thousands of  Somalis.  Once here, these people (and their children and grandchildren) must be supported for their entire lives by welfare (again your taxes).  Our government gives them money, which is then sent to Somalia.  Part of that money goes for anti-American activities, including killing Americans.  Then, even more of your money must be spent by the government to &#8220;study&#8221; this  problem.</p>
<p>Your government: Carefully managing your money and always thinking of your welfare!  Think about that when you pay your taxes.  You are being forced to pay for your own displacement, from your own country.  </p>

			<p>And this sending money to terrorists surprises anyone?? Somalis are so enriching our country, when does piracy on the Great Lakes begin?</p>

			<p>Back in 1993, when Canadian troops served alongside the coalition forces in Somalia, they learned many lessons about Somali behaviour.  </p>
<p>In one instance, Canadian engineers constructed a much-needed public works for a village:  a footbridge. When they returned the next day, the footbridge was gone.  </p>
<p>The thing to know about the Somali clans is that they take everything for themselves, and share nothing with anyone else.  It&rsquo;s where we differ in values, and the reason our society works and theirs doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take the African out of them.  It&rsquo;s just who they are.  All we can do is expect that behaviour and govern ourselves accordingly.</p>

<p>In view of our own banking scandals and economic, business corruption in a land where scams are the business of nearly everything and everyone, right down to your stockings that won&rsquo;t last half as long as they did 30 years ago - I can&rsquo;t imagine you could write this with a straight face, or actually mean what you are writing.</p>
<p>I mean, if our society was working, we wouldn&rsquo;t be making all the complaints we do on this posting site!  </p>
<p>If you think America works, where have you been in the past 50 years? - 100 years - 150 years&hellip;. etc.?  We have been at war with ourselves and our society for at least that long if not from the very beginning when different colonies persecuted members of other colonies for not being the right religion!!</p>
<p>&#8220;Works&#8221; is an illusion.  We have had short periods when it seemed to be working, but it was always expensive for someone else.  I posit that we have yet to make our society really work.</p>

			<p>Catch the anti-American tidbit: &#8220;He added that he was angered by the raid, saying it gave his business a bad image&hellip;&#8221;<br>
And the Star Trib, which probably printed, or will print, this story, wonders why it is going broke. No one reads its stupidities anymore.</p>

			<p>200,000 years of evolution in brutal Africa have selected for traits in Africans that favor survival in that harsh place, such as rapid reproduction and reliance on violence.  Unfortunately, those traits are totally incompatable with modern technological civilized Western societies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the circumstances you describe, which are true enough, I would still rather be an American in America than a Somali in Somalia. It also seems that a Somali would rather be a Somali in America than a Somali in Somalia too. I still say keep Somalis, Ethiopians, Nigerians and any other African blacks out of the U.S. <br>

			<p>Our Western society will continue &#8216;working&rsquo; despite a complete economic collapse, which seems imminent.</p>
<p>Communities will be reconstituted, law and order will be reorganized, and a new economy will take root.  </p>
<p>White values have survived much worse.  By comparison, even under the most favorable conditions, with 20 - 30 years of foreign aid flowing in, Somalis could not organize a society without the deprivations of ritualistic clan wars, hunger, and savagery.  </p>

			<p>And as we speak, some Somali pirates are holding the U.S. Navy at bay with a group of blacks in a LIFEBOAT!!!! If snipers had their way, when the Capt. jumped overboard the blacks could have been shot then, but NOOOOOOOOOOO mustn&rsquo;t &#8216;outrage&rsquo; the muslims by killing any of them. These &#8216;people&rsquo; are like small Peccary pigs in Mexico&hellip;you can&rsquo;t see all of them but mess with one and hundreds come out of EVERYWHERE to attack you.</p>

<p>Africa is still such a hard, dangerous, brutal place BECAUSE of dangerous,brutish African black people.</p>
