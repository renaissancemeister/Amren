<h1>Former Professor in Noose Case Seeks $200M in Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edmund DeMarche, CNN, April 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A professor who gained national attention when a noose was found on her office door and was later fired for alleged plagiarism has filed a defamation lawsuit against her former school.</p>
<p>Madonna Constantine, formerly of the Teachers College of Columbia University, is seeking $200 million in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York State Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Constantine contends her scholarly reputation was ruined when the school in February 2008 released the results of what it said was an 18-month investigation into the plagiarism allegations. The school at the time said it found &#8220;numerous instances in which she used others&rsquo; work without attribution in papers she published in academic journals over the past five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was immediately suspended and later fired in June 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a scheme cooked up between the head of the department and former faculty,&#8221; said Paul J. Giacomo Jr., the lawyer representing Constantine. &#8220;We had evidence of her original writing that dates back to the 1990s, but it was altered or dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Teachers College said, &#8220;This case is totally without merit and (the college) intends to defend against it vigorously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giacomo said the &#8220;baseless&#8221; charges of plagiarism, coming on the heels of the October 2007 noose incident, made some members of the media question that incident.</p>
<p>The plagiarism investigation was under way when the noose was found, and Constantine has charged that the two were connected. During the controversy she sent an e-mail addressed to students that read, &#8220;As one of only two tenured black women full professors at Teachers College, it pains me to conclude that I have been specifically and systematically targeted.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Columbia Professors Get Images of Swastikas, Noose in Mail</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jason Kessler, CNN, April 3, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Three professors and a former professor at Columbia University&rsquo;s Teachers College received hate mail this week, the New York Police Department said. It&rsquo;s the campus that was shaken by several bias crimes directed at black and Jewish professors in 2007.</p>
<p>Three professors received manila envelopes Tuesday with images of swastikas in them.</p>
<p>The fourth, a former professor who is an African-American, was sent a manila envelope containing an image of a noose, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne.</p>
<p>Among those receiving a swastika image was Elizabeth Midlarsky, a Jewish psychologist who has studied psychological principles in the context of the Holocaust, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NYPD Hate Crimes Unit is leading the investigation into the incident. No arrests have been made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No arrests were made in the 2007 incidents. Police declined to say if they believe there is a connection between those cases and the mailings this week.<br>

			<p>I hope they look real hard at Madonna Constantine as the possible culprit of this recent round of hate mail. Looks like she may be trying to beef up her lawsuit with a little more propaganda.</p>

			<p>The plagiarism investigation was under way when the noose was found.  Guess who planed the noose.  Constantine was an &#8220;expert&#8221; on race relations and was undergoing an 18 month investigatgion into the plagiarism charges.   A law firm hired by the school concluded that there were numerous instances in which Constantine used others&rsquo; work without attribution in papers she published over the past five years. So much for her &#8220;scholarly&#8221; reputation.   The real question in the case is whether you can fire a black person even if the evidence is crystal clear that he lied, cheated and hung a noose on her door.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s little doubt that Madonna Constantine was specifically and systematically targeted by Columbia because of her race  &mdash;  when she was hired and when she was tenured.  If not for her race, it&rsquo;s doubtful that she would be teaching at Columbia in the first place.  Maybe she can find a way to sue Columbia for her biased hiring?  </p>
<p>She was terminated for committing blatant academic dishonesty, embarassing herself and the teachers college; case-closed.  We can safely assume that the ultra-liberal Columbia Teacher&rsquo;s College is negotiating with another black professor to replace her as we speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also safe to assume that the noose incident, as well as the swastika mailings, are completely unrelated to this professor&rsquo;s termination, unless the whole thing is a scam designed to make Columbia appear racist and buttress her lawsuit.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprising if we learn that a non-white is responsible for the mailings.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The school at the time said it found &ldquo;numerous instances in which she used others&rsquo; work without attribution in papers she published in academic journals over the past five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How is can a black seem partially qualified if she doesn&rsquo;t utilize plagiarism?  I mean having AA for hiring isn&rsquo;t enough. It is required that they be able to read and write a little bit, unless they&rsquo;re a math major then they have to be able to add, subtract, divide and multiply on an eigth level.</p>
<p>What was the teacher tests revealed a couple years ago?  Something like 60% of teachers couldn&rsquo;t pass elementsry tests?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t say anything about race, but I doubt anybody with a brain thinks it didn&rsquo;t involved blacks and a few mestizos.</p>

&#8216;That white man looked at me funny. That must be worth a few hundred thousand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The only way to protect yourself is to stay away from blacks but that&rsquo;s the last thing blacks want. If that happens, the money stops flowing.</p>

			<p>Posters at this site called this six months ago.  <br>
As an aside, I think that AmReners are generally better at predicting social and financial trends than the average member of the public because we have a more accurate view of reality and human nature.  For instance, I distinctly remember a few posters here who accurately predicted the bursting of the housing bubble due to bank loans given for racial reasons.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;???</p>
<p>Does this mean that the college will be petitioning the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, to reopen their investigations of the &ldquo;noose incident?&rdquo;  I bet Comrade Constantine would loose a bit of her Mau Mau bluster, if they did that.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

i can always tell when Foxman is coming to town.  Swastikas suddenly appear just on the night the security cameras malfunction.</p>

			<p>Great news.  I hope she wins the $200 million plus legal fees including all sorts of things like $10.00 per page for copying, $350. per hour for typists and couriers and other ways attorneys pad their bills.  </p>
<p>I would totally rejoice to see Columbia Teacher&rsquo;s College bankrupted, disgraced adn forced to take her back with full back pay.</p>
<p>That college has been a center of radicalism since its beginnings.  For the past 50 years it&rsquo;s mantra and 10 commandments has been anti white hatred.  It is a major, major creator of all the anti white studies courses for evey level from kindergarten to grad school.</p>
<p>Its hiring practices have provided a haven for every anti American, anti White, anti Christian, anti Western Civilization<br>
radical feminazi since 1920.</p>

			<p>Bon posted the following in the comments about the proposed all Seneca school in New York.</p>
<p>Columbia Teachers College played a big part in developing the current curriculm that Bon describes below. CTC graduates and profs write the anti white textbooks.  They become the administrators that buy the books.  They run write the teacher&rsquo;s continuing education courses.</p>
<p>As I wrote before, I hope CTC goes bankrupt. The Rockefellers will bail CTC out.  After all, it was Rockefellers who funded and organized CTC nearly 100 years ago.</p>
<p>The reality is that the &lsquo;public&rsquo; schools are determined to destroy Whites and Western Civilization &mdash; read a mandated high school history or English textbook lately?</p>
<p>The entire curriculum revolves around this theme: </p>
<p>Whites are the evil scourge of the earth, determined to destroy and wipe-out non-Whites through genocide. Western Civilization represents slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, segregation, racism, economic disempowerment, disenfranchisement, and unfair White-favoring laws used to put NAMs behind bars for life. All White inventions and achievements were stolen from non-Whites. This country was built upon the labors of non-Whites, White wealth is a result of making non-Whites poor.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the interests of redress and social justice, Western Civilization must be destroyed along with the people that created it. The stolen wealth and land must be rightly confiscated and redistributed to the rightful owners of such. </p>
<p>This will be done by debasing White language, distorting their history, placing all blame for non-White failures on evil Whites. In such an evil, racist culture, non-White-on-White crime and violence are justified. And, present-day Whites must be made to pay for what they&rsquo;ve done to non-Whites, no matter how long ago. All of them, by virtue of their skin color, are guilty, guilty, guilty. <br>

			<p>I am shocked&hellip;shocked that there is racial shakedown going on here!  </p>
<p>I think of all the fake &#8220;hate crime&#8221; stories on here over the past few years, this has been the most transparently phony. </p>
<p>It starts to make sense, though, when you pair it up with the stories about blacks not saving for retirement.  Why bother when you can just sue for absurd sum and settle for pennies on the dollar, as this perpetually aggreived liar will undoubtedly do. </p>

			<p>So, nooses and swastikas show up at the Faculty of Education just as Professor Constantine files a $200 million suit which, no doubt, will focus on her &#8220;victimization&#8221; of being the recipient of a noose.  Coincidence?!?  Remember, this so-called &#8220;professor&#8221; pilfered the work of her own students for her own ends.  What would she do for increasing her chances at $200 million?!?  Stay tuned folks, I think the results of this police investigation could get very, very interesting!</p>

			<p>The real question in the case is whether you can fire a black person even if the evidence is crystal clear that he lied, cheated </p>
<p>The answer to the &#8216;real question&rsquo; is a resounding NO!! I predict that this will be settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. It will emerge again a few months after the settlement and hush agreement, blacks are never satisfied.</p>

And, present-day Whites must be made to pay for what they&rsquo;ve done to non-Whites, no matter how long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I notice there is always a Historic norming. That is, white evil must always be made apparent up to whatever time it is in the present. That is, make white evil and white oppression current to whatever day it is today. In 1910, it was probably about &#8216;slavery&rsquo;. 1970 it was slavery + Jim crow. In 1980 it&rsquo;s well who knows. In 1990 it&rsquo;s &#8216;profiling&rsquo; from earlier that year. Nothing changes and the evil is always made right up to date, no matter how many &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; laws are passed. No matter how many whites are killed or intimidated, discriminated against, etc, it&rsquo;s always about people of color. No matter how many poor white folks their are. At one point, up until around 1950, almost everyone lived in poverty. Of course poverty causes crime, which somehow didn&rsquo;t really kick off until the 1960&rsquo;s as poverty rates were decreasing steadily and dramatically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a broken record really, and though, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of a &#8216;racist&rsquo;, well I have, though at one point I remember in elementary school being called a &#8220;&#8216;N&rsquo; lover&#8221;, sort of affectionately actually. I was the only one in class called that. It&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s helped increase my white nationalism. The tales of oppression never change no matter how old you are. Maybe I believed it when I was a kid, but now I&rsquo;m older and see for myself. The same lies they are telling now are the same ones they were telling when I was a kid. Now that I&rsquo;m older I know they&rsquo;re not true. At least, when they talk about the horrible oppression back from the bad old ignorant days of my time.   </p>
<p>I notice this Historic-norming even on AmRen sometimes. There are a few &#8216;historicists&rsquo; who post on occasion.   </p>

<p>Thanks for the &#8216;shout out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only calling it as I see it and it pains me deeply to write such things  &mdash;  I fear for my children and grandchildren and all Whites who will follow my generation.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a world where a PC reign of terror prevents Whites from warning their loved ones about the massive amount of vicious, violent black crime directed at them-and that blacks should be treated as if they are dangerous and to be avoided at all times.  Our people are left open to murder and mayhem.</p>
<p>This same reign of terror has eliminated our heroes and holidays  &mdash;  Easter is now a Spring Holiday, any hint of Christmas is under attack, holidays dedicated to our presidents have been consolidated, we are now made to bow down to a non-White plagiarizer, womanizer and communist, our monuments are under attack, our roads and schools are being renamed  &mdash;  all part of a plan to eliminate Western Civilization and replace it with a NWO with Whites at the bottom.</p>
<p>We are being replaced in our own homelands by low IQd, hostile, angry, White-hating people of the Third World and made to hand over our land, treasure and jobs to people who did not create these things and do not deserve them under any circumstances.  They are put above our own children for careers, college placements and scholarships and they are showered with our money, used to expand their own numbers (while ours shrink). </p>
<p>I used to think the destruction of Whites and Western Civilization was the result of a World Gone Mad.  I now know that I was profoundly wrong.  This destruction and PC reign of terror against Whites is the result of a decades-long, focused, well-funded, well-thought-out, well-executed, coldly calculated plan  &mdash;  or  rather juggernaut  &mdash;  that is being carried out on many fronts by the powerful forces of the hostile elites via the msm, academia and the government itself.   </p>
<p>To resist this destruction  &mdash;  to even question it  &mdash;   is to roil the fury of the frothing at the mouth PC enforcers who will then set out to destroy you, professionally and personally.  Your silence and compliance are guaranteed through threats of lawsuits, career destruction and smearing of your reputation. Your race is not allowed to organize and band together for the protection and advocacy of your people (as is allowed every other race/ethnic group) you may only remain divided as individuals.</p>
<p>And they are succeeding.  Our wealth and property will be the next targets through implementation of massive new taxes, punitive legislation directed at wealth and retirement funds and a coming hyperinflation that will wipe out the rest.</p>
<p>As one poster here wrote to me:  They understand your psychology better than you do.</p>

			<p>This woman strikes me as too dumb, hateful, and impulsive to cover her tracks. Likely she figures the threat of a lawsuit will be enough to stop the college from investigating the charges thoroughly and to get an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>I hope she figures wrong.</p>
<p>Geez, when I was a little kid I used to think that everyone who worked in a university was smart. But then, I also used to think that everyone who worked in a bank was rich&hellip; </p>

			<p>After the noose incident, Madonna Constantine had a press release of her talking to the students at the college. She was RADIANT, beaming at the cameras, obviously not distraught, but glowing with a smile of righteous indignation on her face. it&rsquo;s a very telling photograph. She was enjoying the attention that she herself drummed up. </p>

			<p>An obvious ho-ax (g) like so many we have seen before.</p>
<p>The American concept of giving everybody &#8220;his day in court&#8221; is admirable - but only as long as people have a sense of shame. There should be a modicum of risk associated with such ridiculously frivolous lawsuits - not only for the plaintiff, but also for the lawyer. The current &#8220;heads I win, tails you lose&#8221; is untenable.<br>
(No, I do not know exactly where to draw the line and avoid the slippery slope towards justice only for the moneyed - but isn´t that what we have already?)</p>

			<p>Maybe the security tapes will now surface showing who exactly planted the noose.</p>
<p>The plagarism charge should be pretty easy to prove.</p>
<p>This professor was too obscure for any white person to waste planting hate symbols on.</p>
<p>If a university would accuse a black professor of plagarism you can be sure the case is solid.</p>

			<p>Everything else aside, one wonders what CNN is up to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alleged plagiarism&#8221;? Once it&rsquo;s proven, it&rsquo;s no longer &#8220;alleged.&#8221; That the guilty party continues to plead innocence in no way casts doubts on the conclusion of guilt. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&hellip; the school &hellip; released the results of what it said was an 18-month investigation into the plagiarism allegations
<p>What? 1) Was there or was there not an 18-month investigation? Is the school simply SAYING that there was an 18-month investigation although there wasn&rsquo;t one? 2) The conclusion of the investigation was that she is a plagiarist. At that point, the allegations are no longer allegations. </p></p>
