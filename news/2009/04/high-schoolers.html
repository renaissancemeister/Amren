<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/education/29scores.html?_r=1">&#8216;No Child&rsquo; Law Is Not Closing a Racial Gap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Dillon, New York Times, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The achievement gap between white and minority students has not narrowed in recent years, despite the focus of the No Child Left Behind law on improving the scores of blacks and Hispanics, according to results of a federal test considered to be the nation&rsquo;s best measure of long-term trends in math and reading proficiency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Black and Hispanic elementary, middle and high school students all scored much higher on the federal test than they did three decades ago, most of those gains were not made in recent years, but during the desegregation efforts of the 1970s and 1980s. That was well before the 2001 passage of the No Child law, the official description of which is &#8220;An Act to Close the Achievement Gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [T]here are now far more lower-scoring minorities in relation to whites. In 1971, the proportion of white 17-year-olds who took the reading test was 87 percent, while minorities were 12 percent. Last year, whites had declined to 59 percent while minorities had increased to 40 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2008 score gap between black and white 17-year-olds, 29 points in reading and 26 points in math, could be envisioned as the rough equivalent of between two and three school years&rsquo; worth of learning, said Peggy Carr, an associate commissioner for assessment at the Department of Education.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0429/p02s01-usgn.html">High-Schoolers Have Made Little Progress Since the 1970s, Study Says</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Stacy Teicher Khadaroo, Christian Science Monitor, April 28, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>American 17-year-olds aren&rsquo;t performing any better in reading and math than their bell-bottom-clad counterparts in the early 1970s. That&rsquo;s one conclusion from the latest round of a national test tracking long-term educational trends.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the test shows that younger students  &mdash;  9- and 13-year-olds  &mdash;  are making significant gains. In addition, racial differences in scores have narrowed for all three age groups over the past 30-plus years.</p>
<p>But overall, the mixed results parallel other indicators of how challenging it is to raise academic achievement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 26,000 students took the tests for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  &mdash;  a project overseen by the research wing of the US Department of Education. The results were released Tuesday. As part of the NAEP project, reading scores have been tracked since 1971 and math since 1973.</p>
<p>In the new report, long-term improvements were largest for younger age groups in math. Nine-year-olds gained 24 points since 1973, and 13-year-olds gained 15 points. In reading, the gains were 12 points and 4 points respectively since 1971. That&rsquo;s on a 500-point scale, which NAEP breaks into 50-point intervals to describe the corresponding skill level.</p>
<p>African-American and Hispanic students have improved at greater rates than white students since the 1970s, but since 2004, they&rsquo;ve made little progress in narrowing these so-called achievement gaps. In 2008, for instance, the average reading score for white 9-year-olds was 228  &mdash;  24 points ahead of African-Americans and 21 points ahead of Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NCLB critics point to various NAEP results since 2004 as an indicator of the policy&rsquo;s failure to bring about real improvements and close gaps. Some observers, however, look at the fact that the younger grades have made gains, and they say it&rsquo;s the outcome of a variety of policies, including NCLB, that have emphasized reading and math at those levels.</p>
<p>NAEP administrators caution against attributing good or bad results to any particular policy, given how many factors affect learning and how much school demographics have changed over the past few decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The flat math scores among 17-year-olds happened despite the fact that larger percentages have taken higher-level math courses than in previous decades. That raises questions about whether such courses are really offering higher-level curriculum, whether the students bring the necessary math background to be successful, and whether the teaching is effective, Ms. Wilkins and others say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new NAEP study is titled &#8220;The Nation&rsquo;s Report Card: NAEP 2008 Trends in Academic Progress.&#8221; This kind of NAEP test was last administered in 2004.</p>
<p>The results can&rsquo;t be directly compared with a separate set of NAEP tests, which take a snapshot of various subjects every few years and change over time with curriculum.</p>

			<p>As a person who has taught in New York City Schools for several years, I can only say that the way to start having any chance to advance the academic achievement of black and Hispanic students is to have a new program, what I would call &#8220;Some children left behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now there are students in the public high schools who I would call &#8220;dead wood&#8221; or &#8220;floaters.&#8221; At best, they simply waste their own time, flunk classes, and simply attend for a free lunch or socializing. At worst, they are wasting other students&rsquo; time, along with that of teachers who have to take time to try and discipline the disrupters with few means available.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to have lower class, minority students develop a desire for upward mobility through hard work and study. The &#8220;Ghetto culture&#8221; does exist, mostly as an extreme case of a nationwide, decadent youth culture which affects white students as well.</p>
<p>Which youth have less problems in advancing academically? - the oriental and Jewish students, where the peer pressure to achieve academically and go to univesity is very strong and it&rsquo;s a case of &#8220;a rising tide carries all ships.&#8221; (Think of the definition of a Jewish drop out, &#8220;one who doesn&rsquo;t have a P.H.D.&#8221;)</p>
<p>If the 10-15% minority high school students who are wasting their and everyone else&rsquo;s time in school are gotten rid of, there will be more of a chance for the detrimental ghetto cultural values to not influence so many minority youth, and maybe the peer pressure will start to shift so that academic achievement is seen as a higher value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that optimistic that this would work to a great extent, but I&rsquo;m sure it would improve the studying environment some and allow a higher percentage of minority students to push ahead to a better future.</p>

			<p>In the nature vs nurture argument I have not seen a comparison of black adopted child raised by white parents compared with white child of white parents. </p>
<p>I have seen vast differences in the home lives of hispanics compared with middle class whites where for example there is no quite place, room,  or even time for private study.</p>
<p>I would propose that the chosen lifestyle of some minorities has <br/>
significant influence on child development during critical years.</p>

			<p>So George W. Bush passed a law to make the intelligence gap between the races vanish, and it hasn&rsquo;t worked yet?</p>
<p>While Bush was at it he should have passed a law to narrow the &#8220;height gap&#8221; blacks enjoy over Asians and the &#8220;physical strength gap&#8221; that men have over women.</p>

			<p>All adopted children reached adult IQs that were equal to their biological peers and which had no correlation with their adoptive families.  Transracial studies were not limited to Blacks adopted by Whites but included Asians adopted by Whites.  The Blacks ended up with lower IQs than their adoptive families and the Asians ended up with IQs higher than their adoptive families. </p>

			<p>Where are the data on Asian students in all this?  Am I paranoid to suspect that Asian students&rsquo; scores would embarrass the left wing, and that they therefore must be left out?</p>

<p>Excellent post. We need to identify three groups of students. Those who cannot learn, those who will not learn and those who are capable and willing to learn. Those who will not learn need to be removed from school.</p>
<p>They need a different setting. Possible a psychiatric one or at least a social services one. The only thing that can be done is to try to orient these children until they are 18 years old. I&rsquo;m sure it would be successful in some cases. Even if it fails in most cases these kids need to be gotten out of the academic environment where they drag things down for everyone.</p>
<p>The students who cannot learn need a different academic environment. They need to be taught very basic skills in the hope that they can become productive citizens at some basic unskilled level.</p>
<p>This will leave the students who are capable in the higher level academic environment and improve the education of all of them black and white.</p>
<p>The problem is that more Blacks than Whites will end up in the uncapable group which is why this will never be done.</p>

<p>When will whites stop worrying about how blacks and hispanics raise their children or run their own home? Minding other peoples&rsquo; private lives is a violation of personal freedom and decency. </p>
<p>They are different races and should be in their own living spaces, away from our white living spaces. Then each can develop according to their own potential. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;that the younger grades have made gains, and they say it&rsquo;s the outcome of a variety of policies, including NCLB, that have emphasized reading and math at those levels&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason is simple:  The double-digit IQs of blacks and hispanics only allow them to understand math up to a limited,  rudimentary level, as reflected in the scores year after year.  After that they are not capable of grasping higher level math concepts (as in Algebra I) that require more than one simple step.</p>
<p>Low IQs also limit their vocabularies to the point where reading and comprehending past a low, elementary level is not possible for them.  Comprehension stops when high order thinking skills must be employed (inferences, making predictions, synthesizing works).  </p>
<p>I write this from 25+ years on the front lines of the testing battles, of trying to close what is an intractable IQ gap between NAMs and Whites/Asians, of attending endless meetings blaming NAM failure on White Racism and a White Racist curricula (Gimme a break!).</p>
<p>Even dumbing down the tests repeatedly has not touched this gap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to speak of this openly would cost me my retirement (and much more).  And, again, look for White Racism and Racist White Teachers to be blamed for NAM failures along with screams for (now) trillions of more dollars to be poured into this rat hole.</p>

			<p>BLacks shouldn&rsquo;t be in school with Whites at all, it is only teaching the blacks about how to identify their prey. Blacks and muslims are tribal animals and they cannot and will not, think beyond their tribe. Bling and things are more important and impressive to blacks than an education.</p>

			<p>Giving nonwhite students any extra attention or resources at all is bigotry.  Those who advocate it are bigots.  Everyone should be treated equally.  Same attention, same time, same resources.  Refer to any who endorse special programs for nonwhites as the bigots they are.  Call the bigots bigots at every opportunity!</p>

			<p>the gap will never close. cultural differences  speak for themselves,as others here have shown. some blacks who are willing to work hard should be offered vocational education. this has been cut back by liberals who run the public schools who engage in fantasy that every child should go to college, and that IQ is irrelevant if not dangerous. We want to recapture our industries from the Chinese and others. More jobs for both black and white workers are possible with a nationalist economic and foreign policy. </p>
<p>We have too many overpriced colleges as it is. We need to cut back on college spending, instead of throwing dollars as Obama would do at these obsolete islands of yesterday&rsquo;s thinking and overbuilt and overstaffed campuses.<br/>
Colleges should be for the truly bright: some whites, some Asians, some Jews. Every historic so called black college should be shut down or turned into a vocational institute. </p>

			<p>It may actually be multiculturalism that is affecting minorities on issues involving education. The whole U.S. educational system is so dishonest and focused on so many irrelevances because of multiculturalism, that the shear bordome of it all, makes it a wonder that anyone is interested in learning anything. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The 2008 score gap between black and white 17-year-olds, 29 points in reading and 26 points in math, could be envisioned as the rough equivalent of between two and three school years&rsquo; worth of learning, said Peggy Carr, an associate commissioner for assessment at the Department of Education.&#8221;</p>
<p>It SHOULD be envisioned as the rough equivalent of between 12 and 18 IQ points. After all, everyone has been exposed to a nearly standardized curriculum and testing regimen for K-12. The problem for black and Hispanic students isn&rsquo;t an inability to count and read, but an inability to think logically and quantitatively.</p>
<p>Ms Carr likes to figure the gap in terms of school years because it makes the problem sound soluble with more white taxpayer provided education.</p>

			<p>Bon:</p>
<p>What you observed and what this article states is also matter of that taboo subject of racial differences.  This is not the best analogy, but it&rsquo;s illustrative:  A six-month old dog is far more mature <i>relative to the typical life history of a dog</i> than a six-month old human being is relative to a typical human life cycle and development.  &#8220;Lesser,&#8221; if you will, mammal species mature relative to their own selves faster than more &#8220;advanced&#8221; ones (again, for a lack of a better word).</p>
<p>And so it is with blacks and whites.  Blacks mature more quickly in childhood than whites, including in terms of mental development, but then as a measure of central tendency, level off in the late elementary school to early middle and junior high school ages.  Stories like this are so common that all they have to do is save the prose and change the dates.  Of course black elementary school students tend to do well in terms of the achievement gap, because they&rsquo;re ahead of whites at that age.  Of course head start works, because black preschoolers tend to be more mentally and physically developed than whites of the same age.  Then comes age 12.</p>

<p>I agree that there should not be &#8220;black&#8221; colleges at all but just colleges where anyone who is bright, black or white attends.</p>
<p>&#8220;BLacks shouldn&rsquo;t be in school with Whites at all&#8221;</p>
<p>There are certainly some blacks who are intelligent and want to succeed and these blacks in schools with whites are fine. However, the many blacks, hispanics as well as some whites who are of low intelligence should be in seperate lower level rudimentary classes and given vocational training.<br/>
