<h1>Thought Police Muscle Up in Britain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hal G. P. Colebatchm, The Australian (Surry Hills, New South Wales), April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain appears to be evolving into the first modern soft totalitarian state. As a sometime teacher of political science and international law, I do not use the term totalitarian loosely.</p>
<p>There are no concentration camps or gulags but there are thought police with unprecedented powers to dictate ways of thinking and sniff out heresy, and there can be harsh punishments for dissent.</p>
<p>Nikolai Bukharin claimed one of the Bolshevik Revolution&rsquo;s principal tasks was &#8220;to alter people&rsquo;s actual psychology&#8221;. Britain is not Bolshevik, but a campaign to alter people&rsquo;s psychology and create a new Homo britannicus is under way without even a fig leaf of disguise.</p>
<p>The Government is pushing ahead with legislation that will criminalise politically incorrect jokes, with a maximum punishment of up to seven years&rsquo; prison. The House of Lords tried to insert a free-speech amendment, but Justice Secretary Jack Straw knocked it out. It was Straw who previously called for a redefinition of Englishness and suggested the &#8220;global baggage of empire&#8221; was linked to soccer violence by &#8220;racist and xenophobic white males&#8221;. He claimed the English &#8220;propensity for violence&#8221; was used to subjugate Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and that the English as a race were &#8220;potentially very aggressive&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years I have collected reports of many instances of draconian punishments, including the arrest and criminal prosecution of children, for thought-crimes and offences against political correctness.</p>
<p>Countryside Restoration Trust chairman and columnist Robin Page said at a rally against the Government&rsquo;s anti-hunting laws in Gloucestershire in 2002: &#8220;If you are a black vegetarian Muslim asylum-seeking one-legged lesbian lorry driver, I want the same rights as you.&#8221; Page was arrested, and after four months he received a letter saying no charges would be pressed, but that: &#8220;If further evidence comes to our attention whereby your involvement is implicated, we will seek to initiate proceedings.&#8221; It took him five years to clear his name.</p>
<p>Page was at least an adult. In September 2006, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, Codie Stott, asked a teacher if she could sit with another group to do a science project as all the girls with her spoke only Urdu. The teacher&rsquo;s first response, according to Stott, was to scream at her: &#8220;It&rsquo;s racist, you&rsquo;re going to get done by the police!&#8221; Upset and terrified, the schoolgirl went outside to calm down. The teacher called the police and a few days later, presumably after officialdom had thought the matter over, she was arrested and taken to a police station, where she was fingerprinted and photographed. According to her mother, she was placed in a bare cell for 3 1/2 hours. She was questioned on suspicion of committing a racial public order offence and then released without charge. The school was said to be investigating what further action to take, not against the teacher, but against Stott. Headmaster Anthony Edkins reportedly said: &#8220;An allegation of a serious nature was made concerning a racially motivated remark. We aim to ensure a caring and tolerant attitude towards pupils of all ethnic backgrounds and will not stand for racism in any form.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 10-year-old child was arrested and brought before a judge, for having allegedly called an 11-year-old boy a &#8220;Paki&#8221; and &#8220;bin Laden&#8221; during a playground argument at a primary school (the other boy had called him a skunk and a Teletubby). When it reached the court the case had cost taxpayers pound stg. 25,000. The accused was so distressed that he had stopped attending school. The judge, Jonathan Finestein, said: &#8220;Have we really got to the stage where we are prosecuting 10-year-old boys because of political correctness? There are major crimes out there and the police don&rsquo;t bother to prosecute. This is nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finestein was fiercely attacked by teaching union leaders, as in those witch-hunt trials where any who spoke in defence of an accused or pointed to defects in the prosecution were immediately targeted as witches and candidates for burning.</p>
<p>Hate-crime police investigated Basil Brush, a puppet fox on children&rsquo;s television, who had made a joke about Gypsies. The BBC confessed that Brush had behaved inappropriately and assured police that the episode would be banned.</p>
<p>A bishop was warned by the police for not having done enough to &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221;, the enforcing of which is now apparently a police function. A Christian home for retired clergy and religious workers lost a grant because it would not reveal to official snoopers how many of the residents were homosexual. That they had never been asked was taken as evidence of homophobia.</p>
<p>Muslim parents who objected to young children being given books advocating same-sex marriage and adoption at one school last year had their wishes respected and the offending material withdrawn. This year, Muslim and Christian parents at another school objecting to the same material have not only had their objections ignored but have been threatened with prosecution if they withdraw their children.</p>
<p>There have been innumerable cases in recent months of people in schools, hospitals and other institutions losing their jobs because of various religious scruples, often, as in the East Germany of yore, not shouted fanatically from the rooftops but betrayed in private conversations and reported to authorities. The crime of one nurse was to offer to pray for a patient, who did not complain but merely mentioned the matter to another nurse. A primary school receptionist, Jennie Cain, whose five-year-old daughter was told off for talking about Jesus in class, faces the sack for seeking support from her church. A private email from her to other members of the church asking for prayers fell into the hands of school authorities.</p>
<p>Permissiveness as well as draconianism can be deployed to destroy socially accepted norms and values. The Royal Navy, for instance, has installed a satanist chapel in a warship to accommodate the proclivities of a satanist crew member. &#8220;What would Nelson have said?&#8221; is a British newspaper cliche about navy scandals, but in this case seems a legitimate question. Satanist paraphernalia is also supplied to prison inmates who need it.</p>
<p>This campaign seems to come from unelected or quasi-governmental bodies controlling various institutions, which are more or less unanswerable to electors, more than it does directly from the Government, although the Government helps drive it and condones it in a fudged and deniable manner.</p>
<p>Any one of these incidents might be dismissed as an aberration, but taken together  &mdash;  and I have only mentioned a tiny sample; more are reported almost every day  &mdash;  they add up to a pretty clear picture.<br>

			<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;He claimed the English &ldquo;propensity for violence&rdquo; was used to subjugate Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and that the English as a race were &ldquo;potentially very aggressive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The meaning of this is that Jack Straw has made a mental decision that Brits somehow are more prone to agression and violence than&hellip; ?  How this is not discrimination - to make such a comment about Whites and English Whites in particular, is beyond my ability to comprehend.  It&rsquo;s unmistakeable - there is no other way to interpret him, White, British must be cleansed from Britian, but by implication - the world.</p>
<p>This constitutes far more than a thought crime; It is a call to implement the genocide of Whites.</p>
<p>I was wrong about what I have said in the past concering the feasibility of a White only nation because Jack Straw is making it clear that Whites need their own country where they will not be selected out and persecuted for being White.</p>

			<p>This utter nonsense will only help to propel the BNP to get a larger share of the votes in future elections. Everybody over there knows that political correctness has reached what could be regarded as near comical proportions, if it weren&rsquo;t for the sad cases of it&rsquo;s victims. </p>
<p>Things have gone full circle. In spite of the English being characterized as having a &#8220;propensity for violence&#8221;, they are nothing but sheep now in the face of the destruction of their society/culture/nation from within. God help them. </p>
<p>Slowly, bit by bit the United States will be heading in the same direction. First step is passage of the hate crimes bill and Fairness Doctrine in Congress, then a little bit more in bits and pieces in future legislation, so that one day we have to act like we are at a RR crossing: stop, look, listen for the PC Police before you say anything that might possibly offend some protected minority status group.</p>

<p>The Saudis already HAVE these thought police and they are coming to Britian (maybe already there) and will soon be in the U.S.</p>

			<p>Although I don&rsquo;t want to brook arguments from interlopers about whether the white race is more &#8220;moral&#8221; than others, I think it&rsquo;s accurate to denote it as more <i>&#8220;moralistic&#8221;</i> than other races.  <p>It appears to me that out of this tendency has perversely evolved a kind of self-hatred and loathing, even as I called it earlier, a &#8220;mania for extinction,&#8221; that is nowhere so strongly represented as among the governing elites of Britain.  If the native white people want to survive racially, culturally, nationally, linguistically&hellip;indeed, if they want to <b>SURVIVE,</b> full stop, they must repudiate, and if necessary, overthrow their political class.  Support for the British National Party is what I would recommend.</p></p>

			<p>Think back to the &#8216;British Invasion&rsquo; music of the 1960&rsquo;s.  Britain was the first European country to start &#8216;losing it&rsquo;; drugs, illicit sex, pornography, a break-up of the family unit.  It happened there first.  England is the furthest along the route of destruction.  By looking at England we can predict where we are going to be in about 10 years if this lunacy isn&rsquo;t stopped.  The British have lost their sense of identity as a people.  Even the lawmakers are actively committing collective suicide passing laws that only affect natural White British-born citizens.  It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>

			<p>Revolution is starting to appear as the only possible solution to these neo-communist governments in Europe.  However, it has to occur before they pack these nations with more third-world immigrants.  The government and the major political parties are non-representative and corrupt, and the legal system is rigged against any changes except those that move the laws to the left.</p>
<p>We in the Western nations are so conditioned against the concept of overthrowing governments that we have forgotten how often it has occurred throughout history.  The overthrow does not even have to be violent if a critical mass of people, and people in critical positions are behind it.  For example, the overthrow of the old communist block governments in Europe was largely non-violent.  We may be approaching such a critical point in history again in these other, formally democratic, now neo-communist nations.</p>

			<p>This is the society Obama, Napolitano and Holder are trying to create in America. The economic collapse will furnish them the excuse they need to implement emergency measures that will become permanent.  GOP apparatchicks who hailed Bush&rsquo;s executive expansion, ideologues like Harvey Mansfield and VDH who argued for more and more central authority and executive &#8220;discretion and energy,&#8221; will live to find themselves under the boot of the very apparatus they helped create.  This was the thesis of Tocqueville&rsquo;s l&rsquo;ancien regime: the King had already created a central authority that was taken over by Jacobins - enter the guillotine.  </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t even comprehend that the teacher would scream at this girl for wanting to be in another study group.  How can one study if you can&rsquo;t understand what the others are saying?  Yet she threatened this girl with the police, and then she did get hauled off.  I fail to see what was racist?  She wanted to learn and participate in class.  It is obvious this teacher set her up.  I can still hardly believe that something like this would happen.  Has England gone mad?  What sickos are in charge?  This whole article is incomprehensible.  </p>

			<p>the sad thing is&hellip; most (white) British people that would read this would say that some &#8220;right-winged crazy racist American people&#8221; wrote this and made it sound worse than it really is in the UK. and me as a reader would be called a racist. the BNP is regarded as a RACIST organisation. certain newspapers, such as the Daily Mail/Daily Express are said to be biased, racist newspapers. and Fox News is a redneck racist joke of a thing as well. <br>
what is it, denial? fear? they know it&rsquo;s all true, it&rsquo;s right under their noses. I think 99% of all British people that actually have any sense would agree with things stated in this article&hellip; except that they&rsquo;re probably too afraid to admit it. it&rsquo;s just unacceptable to display any sort of dislike for anything that is non-white, if you know what I mean. </p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m probably just saying things that everyone already knows&hellip; but I live in the UK. I know what the people are like. I feel the fear settling in. I&rsquo;m afraid to bring children into this world one day. </p>

			<p>One little thought to add in to the mix; Jack Straw&rsquo;s referrence to the &#8220;global garbage of the empire&#8221; as the &#8220;White xenophobic nationalist whites responsible for soccer game violence&#8221; is simply a continuance of elite British disdain and mistreatment of the working classes and poor.  These people, who were always oppressed, worked to death, neglected, pressed into military service, taxed, left to die in alleys, etc., throughout English history may well have produced an underclass of Whites who have nothing left to do but fight for a little turf because fighting for survival is all they have left.  They can&rsquo;t fly off to America and get a job instantly because of the &#8220;charming accent.&#8221;  Besides, we are now increasingly favoring non-Whites with British accents here in the US.  So perhaps he is right, this class of English Whites perhaps are the left-overs.  But they are the British government and Royal familie&rsquo;s responsibility and they have an obligation to do better for them than simply seek to displace them with foreigners that they imagine will be easier to abuse.  Jack Straw and his type have obviously not thought it all out.</p>

			<p><i> He claimed the English &ldquo;propensity for violence&rdquo; was used to subjugate Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and that the English as a race were &ldquo;potentially very aggressive&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always confused by the complete denial of these white &#8220;liberals&#8221; (&#8220;liberal&#8221; as in slightly to the left of Marx) as to the mere fact that <b>all</b> stronger races, nations and cultures will <b>always</b> dominate - or attempt to dominate - weaker ones.</p>
<p>Seriously, these are the loonies that believe - if sub-Saharan Africa and Europe were in each other&rsquo;s place technologically and culturally speaking - every nation would be holding hands, as opposed to the Songhai and Zulu Empires fighting over who controls Denmark.</p>
<p>And for a man so dismissive of the &#8220;violent, white trash-nature&#8221; of indigenous Englishmen, it&rsquo;s amusing that he hasn&rsquo;t fled the Isles for somewhere safer - South Africa perhaps?</p>
<p><i>Nikolai Bukharin claimed one of the Bolshevik Revolution&rsquo;s principal tasks was &ldquo;to alter people&rsquo;s actual psychology&rdquo;. Britain is not Bolshevik, but a campaign to alter people&rsquo;s psychology and create a new Homo britannicus is under way without even a fig leaf of disguise.</i></p>
<p>Many comparisons are made between modern Britain and the Soviet Union/European puppet states associated with the Soviet Union.<br>
But do you know what the saddest <i>difference</i> is?<br>
The Baltics, eastern Germany and Europe etc and even parts of western Russia - assuming them as &#8220;white&#8221; of course - were <b>almsot exactly as &#8220;white&#8221; as they were <i>before</i> the Soviet Union</b>.</p>
<p>Will the same be said of Britain pre-1960s and post-2010?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve nailed it there mate! This fellow Straw (and all those of his ilk) despise the British working class and yet for some perverse reason will fawn over aliens. Does this person (Straw - whose mind has obviously wandered) expect us to believe that he gives a damn about the Irish, Scots and Welsh either?<br>
The English underclass has, throughout history been sent to conquor countries that they have never even heard of to increse the wealth of people such as Lord Straw and sent out to be slaughtered in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><br>
Also, to whoever posted this article, was this a letter to the editor in the Australian?</p>

			<p>     Dickens, in one of his novels, wrote of a &#8220;Mrs Jellaby&#8221; who<br>
wept over the poor, starving African Children while at the same<br>
time she was throwing her tenants off her estate. Well, he has<br>
turned out to be a prophet. The Jellabies have triumphed in En-<br>
gland. You can expect no mercy from these vicious, deluded crea-<br>
tures. They are equal parts ignorance, arrogance, and hatred, yet<br>
they consider themselves as misunderstood healers and saints <br>
without honor in their own country. They must be overthrown while<br>
you still have the strength to do so.</p>
