<h1>Councilman Removes Confederate Flags From Graves</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Edge, Media General News Service, April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mary Norman was shocked Thursday afternoon when Auburn Councilman Arthur L. Dowdell pulled up a Confederate flag placed on her great-grandfather&rsquo;s grave and snapped it in half, she said.</p>
<p>Dowdell, who denies snapping the flag, said Thursday he was picking up his daughter from Auburn Junior High School near the cemetery when several people told him they &#8220;had a problem&#8221; with the flags.</p>
<p>He drove to the cemetery and started pulling up flags, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s offensive to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To me, it represents the Ku Klux Klan and racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United Daughters of the Confederacy placed the flags earlier this week, as they have done for 50 years, in preparation for a celebration Sunday of Confederate Memorial Day, Norman said.</p>
<p>Confederate Memorial Day will be celebrated as a state holiday in Alabama Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the flags had been placed on my great-grandfather&rsquo;s grave, who was a Confederate soldier,&#8221; Norman said. &#8220;He just got very upset, and he went over to my great-grandfather&rsquo;s grave, picked up the flag and broke it in two.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said Dowdell did not know the plot she stood on was her family&rsquo;s. The flags were placed on soldiers&rsquo; graves as a mark of respect, she said.</p>
<p>He pulled up Confederate flags from other soldiers&rsquo; graves, too, she said.</p>
<p>Dowdell said in his years as councilman, he had never seen so many Confederate flags in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going on the record that this will never happen again,&#8221; Dowdell said. &#8220;This will never happen again as long as I&rsquo;m on the city council.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dowdell denied intentionally snapping the flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have snapped itself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If it did, so what? If I had my way, I would have broke them all up and stomped on them and burned them. That flag represents another country, another nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Auburn Mayor Bill Ham said he was unaware of any incidents at the cemetery but said he talked with Dowdell Thursday afternoon. Ham said his understanding was that all city cemeteries have covenants governing how and what types of decorations can be placed on graves, except for Pine Hill because it is so old. Ham said he believed Dowdell asked an assistant city manager to look into making policies equal for cemeteries across the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ham said in his conversation with Dowdell, the councilman suggested the flags be placed on the graves for a shorter period of time, perhaps for 24 hours before the event.</p>
<p>For now, the remaining flags will stay on the graves because of the lack of covenant governing Pine Hill, Ham said. But that could change in coming years.</p>

			<p>  A local should charge the Councilman with theft of the flags and a Federal Charge of disturbing a grave may be possible.<br>
  Also it should be argued that changing the rules to prevent the flags must be uniformly applied and no other flags can be displayed that might be offensive including but not limited to:<br>
African American designs, African emblems,Mexican flags, the flag or banner of ALL Black organizations and others.<br>
  I have previously brought charges for removing items from graves including Confederate ones and obtained convictions.<br>
  I hope that someone took a picture.<br>
  Among the graves that I brought charges over were the graves of Black Confederate Officers. Please note that the Union had NO Black officers and the Confederacy had non-white General Officers despite what the pc crowd thinks.<br>

			<p> I suggest that the nearest encampment of the Sons of Confederate Veterans supervise the replacement of every single Confederate flag that this idiot pulled up, then warn anyone who might try to duplicate his desecration that flags aren&rsquo;t the only things that can be &#8220;snapped,&#8221; and that members of the Sons will be watching the gravesite carefully.</p>
<p> I can&rsquo;t believe the almighty gall of this so-called &#8220;public servant.&#8221; He needs to be taught some manners, promptly.</p>

			<p>But, but, according to the idea of Multiculturalism, the more different we are, the better we get along.  Could it be that people of different races have different viewpoints and that these different viewpoints might lead to discord and even violence?  Could it be that it is really, really dangerous to force people of radically different races, religions, cultures, and customs to live together?  </p>

			<p>And some people thought that blacks might moderate their behavior now that they had a black pres. Obamas election ment to the blacks that now they could get away with anything.  This just shows that they now feel that they can behave any way they feel like, and that there will be no consequences.  I&rsquo;m sure that grave desecration is a crime in Alabama; why hasn&rsquo;t Dowdell been arrested and charged?  Why hasn&rsquo;t Mary Norman filed charges?<br>
This was a gross and calculated insult, and it cannot remain unanswered without even worse consequences for our people.</p>
<p>We cannot coexist with these people on a basis of equality.  Either we RULE them, or they will RULE us.</p>

<p>Just playing a little word substitution game; actually, I do hope this political animal just ended his own career, but the mayor and his cohorts sound pretty &#8220;yella&#8221;, so unless the citizens of auburn run him out of town on a rail, I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p>

			<p>This is so outrageous that it is almost unbelievable.  This arrogant, arrogant black man thinks, as many others,that he can do anything he wants if something upsets him.  He obviously thinks that the peoples honoring their ancestors have NO rights.  Could whites descrate black graves like Malcolm X if they disagreed with what he stood for?   I can&rsquo;t say enough about this self-righteous idiot who believes he is above the law because he&rsquo;s a black city councilman.  You can just see by his picture how proud he is of what he has done.  </p>

			<p>The simple and tragic fact of the matter is that these people, as a group, simply have no place in a modern civil society. Though there are many exceptions, most lack the intellect, self-control, and motivation to be successful, contributing members of our society. Their record of failure is unvarying throughout history.  They create nothing of value.  What they&rsquo;re given to preserve for their own use they destroy, ienvitably, unvaryingly, and very quickly. They never, left to their own devices, developed a written language and thus a recorded history.  I cannot think of a single invention, however primitive, which originated in sub-Sahara Africa. And yet &#8220;sociologists&#8221; keep developing increasingly absurd and convoluted explanations for their unbroken history failure in the modern world.</p>
<p>This steadfast refusal to acknowledge clear reality cannot continue indefinitely, and when people finally cease to accept this corrosive madness the results will be violent and ugly.</p>

			<p>The imbeciles that are the American Left have already ceded the country of our forefathers - the greatest nation ever devised by man - to a future anarchy that today takes the relatively benign form of government-mandated &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221;  Sadly, these insidious leftist policies have encountered virtually no meaningful opposition from the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; American Right, which for several decades has been scared to death to stand for traditional American culture for fear of being labeled &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes both the Left and mainstream Right idiots (as well as, applicable to many on the Right, cowards) is that - unlike the readers of American Renaissance - both are largely clueless as to the inevitable, socially destructive consequences of the government-coerced policies they have visited upon us over the past 55 years. &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; captures the essence of it: incompatible cultures are in mortal conflict today in America under the absurd, Alice-in-Wonderland pretext that &#8220;diversity is our strength.&#8221; All the while, multiculturalism is slowly burying the Anglo-American culture without which there never could have been a United States of America.</p>
<p>But then, to prefer Anglo-American culture to Congolese culture would be racist. Idiots indeed.</p>

			<p>We need someone like Nick Griffin of the BNP in Britain!  There is no political party in the USA that champions the rights, history and dignity of white Americans.  For that reason we are being persecuted.  </p>
<p>Those who dislike whites recognize our unorganized, weakened state and lick their chops in anticipation of more power, money and special consideration for them and more demoralization for us.  We need to have organizations that stand up for whites, just as non-whites have all their organizations.  It is not racist to protect your family, and we whites are an extended family under siege by groups who want us gone or totally powerless.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t get a leader soon we will be a persecuted minority in a more dangerous country.  South Africa or Mexico, anyone?</p>

<p>I have thought in the past of exercising my First Amendment rights by starting a Committee to Reimpose Black Slavery in the USA by making it legal.  Lets see how they like that.  If they want to hit our hot buttons, we can touch their hot buttons.</p>
<p>I read some of the comments posted at the Dolthan newspaper.  They read like AmRen comments.  They always have to be scratching at the scab, they just can&rsquo;t leave it alone.  Rape our women.  Murder our men.  Desecrate our graves.  I rest tonight knowing full well that our Great Black Father in Washington and his black Attorney General will protect our dead to the full extent of the their law.</p>

<p>Maybe Dowdell could find some weeds to pull up or some grass to cut while he&rsquo;s out there.  If we let Obama take over the banks and automotive industry, then Dowdell should be able to take over the cemetery.</p>

			<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what to say, except that I am infuriated, I wish I could give this man a sound thrashing, and that the liberals will soon make it a law that displaying these flags is &#8220;hate&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am also quite disgusted by that emblem around this miscreant&rsquo;s neck. It has ceased to mean anything, and has been used to justify all sorts of mayhem (and violence!)against our people, ever since the Abolitionists. White righteous anger has been dampened by appeal to Christianity, with its teaching to love our enemies, turn the other cheek, and treat all as our brothers. Somehow, the Blacks did not get that message at THEIR churches.</p>

As usual, the Black kid who shot the White kid was a &#8220;hard worker&#8221;, &#8220;polite and considerate&#8221;, and a &#8220;good student&#8221;.  And takes a gun to the movies.</p>

<p>Whites gave non-Whites permission a long time ago to take advantage of them.  If only 5% of Whites in this country were racially active, none of this nonsense would be happening.  I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many times I&rsquo;ve tried to get Whites in my area to wake up (including running for political office) but I&rsquo;ve reached the point in my life where I feel like John the Baptist (&#8220;A lone voice crying out in the wilderness!&#8221;).</p>

As recently as 1985 Tom Petty had a huge Confederate battle flag as his stage backdrop during the Southern Accents tour.  Today he&rsquo;d be run out of town.  </p>

<p>Was he born a coward (nature), or was he made a coward (nurture)?</p>
<p>My candidate would be nature.  The environment for whites has radically changed in the last century. </p>
<p>Forced institutionalization from age 5 to age 18 in government schools is a new thing under the sun. As late as 1900, only 5 percent of Americans graduated from high school. </p>
<p>Is the greatly increased exposure to government schools during the formative years a partial explanation for the helplessness of whites?</p>

			<p>This infuriates me to the point that trying to be civil taxes my patience.  If the council passes a regulation forbidding Confederate flags on the graves of Confederate soldiers, I hope their descendants will make certain that each and every veteran&rsquo;s grave has a Confederate flag placed on it in defiance of this blatant interference with honoring one&rsquo;s ancestors by the local government.  Let&rsquo;s just say that if someone removed a Confederate flag from the grave of one of my relatives in such a disrespectful manner, I wouldn&rsquo;t need the authorities to remedy the situation.  I&rsquo;d let my fists and/or the nearest thing I could find to strike the hardest blow with do the talking for me. I hope Dowdell burns in Hell, even though that would be a fate too good for him.</p>

			<p><i>Just wait til the blacks get power.</i><br>
<p><br>
Not going to happen. They&rsquo;re only 12% of the population, their numbers are stable, and they have an average I.Q. of 85, which is 15 points below the white mean. <br>
<p><br>
Hispanics and Asians represent a much greater long-term threat to the white race than blacks do, even though they are, on average, less violent. They have higher I.Q.&rsquo;s, better impulse control, and their numbers are rapidly increasing. <br>
<p><br>
If and when Asians and/or Hispanics take over, they might let us stick around, but blacks will be dealt with in a ruthless, no-nonsense manner, as they have absolutely nothing to offer any society except for unskilled labor, which Mexicans will do for half the money while causing half the trouble. <br>
<p><br>
All in all, I&rsquo;d say the future is looking a lot grimmer for blacks than it is for whites. </p></p></p></p></p>

&#8221; As a young man,racism seemed to me a single-edge knife, one that whites used to hold blacks down . Now I see that our own racism can be as dangerous and insidious as that which we have battled for centuries . I see racism in people who purport to represent all African Americans .I see racism in a community that refuses to hold one of it&rsquo;s own responsible .I see racism in myself . It is wrong. We cannot defeat their racism with our own ; we cannot defeat bigotry by cheating justice .&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   Christopher Darden, African American prosecutor in OJ Simpson case .  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - I&rsquo;ve read over the post and would also like to add that Alabama&rsquo;s trucks and albums all had Confederate flags on them .&#8221;Platoon&#8221; and &#8220;Cape Fear&#8221; both had positive representations of the Confederate flag in them . Almost all current attacks on the South and her symbols can be traced back to Kwiesi Mfume assuming he reins of the NAACP.</p>

<p>Awhile back AR reprinted an article about the Chinese setting up shop in Africa. If the natives get restless it will be interesting to see how the Chinese   &mdash;   who have never imbibed the multicultural Kool-Aid   &mdash;   will deal with them. My hunch is the Africans will quickly wish they were back under European colonial rule.</p>

			<p>In 1968 in the 6th grade our priciple brought the whole white class to the auditoriun to inform all the kids due to new zoning we would be having some colored children joining us for the upcoming year.He also told us to make them feel welcome. 8 or 9 black kids joined our school that year and everyone went out of they&rsquo;re way to make them feel welcome, and they were very curtious and friendly as well.The following year segregation brought all together.With close to a 50-50 ratio of blacks to whites the ones we went out of our way to help feel welcome soon forgot who we were.I just love the liberals who claim to understand the plight of the blacks after going thru school or working with a few blacks.They speak for all yet we all pay for their ignorance.Blacks hate ass kissers worse than you think. </p>

			<p>&#8220;the liberals who claim tounderstand&hellip;after going through school or working with a few Blacks&#8221;.  Shaqeena.  Dead on.  When I was in the service, the state of racial calm was entire dependent on the proportion of Blacks.  At ten percent, the Blacks got along fine.  At 20 percent, things began to get contentious.  At 30 percent, they were out of control.  When, for some reason, a Black was alone among Whites, he was just another man, and nobody troubled him.  The same guy, back with his own, would be the ugliest spiteful White hater in the unit.  <br>
     If you&rsquo;ve seen the old movie &#8220;Animal House&#8221;, recall the scene when the White frat boys go to the Black roadhouse to hear Otis Day and the Knights, a group they had  hired to play at their parties.  The nasty look on the singer&rsquo;s face when one of the Whites calls out, &#8220;Otis, my MAN!&#8221;  says it all.   </p>

			<p>   We&rsquo;d had a few black students since around 1966 or so . We had always postulated they were getting paid to attend our school in south Georgia .Believe it or not I was somewhat liberal in those days . In the fall of 1970 we integrated fully in compliance with &#8220;Brown vs Board.&#8221; Our tiny C class school went to a quad A overnight . I was one of 15 whites out of a graduating class 120 . I had two classes where all of the other students were black and so were the teachers, I was the only white in there . The black teachers were older so they were very considerate and probably opposed integration . It was the younger black teachers right out of college who were the activist and hostile to the white students . There was a black counselor who owned a &#8216;57 Ford that looked brand new . He used to sit with me in my &#8216;57 model 210 Chevy at lunch and we would talk politics, he was against integration and a good person( I was actually in favor of integration, at least somewhat, unbelievable eh ?) . Most of the black students were equally good people . Despite all of their muscles, they did not seem to be very strong then, while they excelled at basketball, they were not very good at football and baseball . I realize that all seems to have somehow reversed itself since those days . One day in the gym I was pressing 90 or 100 pounds with one arm, they couldn&rsquo;t do it . I was tall and light weight but pretty strong for a 150 pounder . I used to deliver furniture after school, that&rsquo;s how  I purchased my &#8216;57 . 355 bucks financed by GMAC, 18/mo . Bet you wish your car payment was that low . Anyway, I got the barbell over my head and started falling backwards . Those black kids caught me, if they hadn&rsquo;t I would&rsquo;ve broken my arm and shoulder . Good kids, that&rsquo;s small town USA and regardless of what you have heard, it was small town South . But that does not in any way justify the destruction of one culture, southern whites, to noble-ize and lift up another culture,African Americans . And that is exactly what has occurred in the South, most especially in the blackbelt .          </p>
