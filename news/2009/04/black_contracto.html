<h1>Black Contractors File Bias Suit Against Toyota</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Denise Stewart, Los Angeles Sentinel, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fish &amp; Fisher, a black-owned general contractor in Jackson, Mississippi, hauled more than 1 million cubic tons of dirt to make way for a new Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., and also helped expand the Jackson-Evers International Airport.</p>
<p>But when it came time to hand out the big contracts for construction of a new Toyota plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi in 2007, Fish &amp; Fisher says it was left out of the process.</p>
<p>Fish &amp; Fisher has filed a federal lawsuit in Mississippi, claiming racial discrimination in the bid process for the Toyota plant. The company is seeking unspecified damages in the suit that also names as defendants Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and the Mississippi Development Authority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had had an opportunity, we absolutely would have bid on the project, but we weren&rsquo;t given that opportunity,&#8221; Fish &amp; Fisher co-owner Jacqueline Williams told BlackAmericaweb.com. &#8220;They invited only five companies to bid. At a time when the state gave $300 million in incentives to bring the plant to Mississippi, they still only allowed certain insiders to bid.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To bid as general contractor, a company must have annual sales four times above the value of the Toyota project, McDaniel said.</p>
<p>Williams said Fish &amp; Fisher met the requirements for minority company participation with Toyota because it is certified by the National Minority Supplier Development Council.</p>
<p>Byron Perkins, a Birmingham, Alabama lawyer representing Fish &amp; Fisher, said the exclusion of that company from the bid process is something that happens all too often to black-owned businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;This practice is still rampant, and it&rsquo;s time for it to stop,&#8221; Perkins told BlackAmericaweb.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McDaniel said Toyota is one of only 14 companies in the United States to be a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a designation given to companies who spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers and demonstrate a strong overall commitment to supplier diversity.</p>

			<p>If he&rsquo;s right, then I&rsquo;m not surprised.  The Japanese know the time of day when it comes to American blacks, and aren&rsquo;t constrained by political correctness.  Every once in awhile, a Japanese executive will be heard or overheard linking American blacks to violent crime (gee, where would they get a crazy idea like that?).  Part of the reason is that American black soldiers occupying Japan tend not to respect Japanese women.</p>

			<p>This is a brilliant article, starting out with claiming that the plaintiff in this case hauled a million &#8220;cubic tons&#8221; of dirt for the construction of a new Nissan plant.</p>
<p>But aside from the inability of the &#8220;journalist&#8221; in question to distinguish between weight and volume, the suit presumes that Toyota has no right to select its own bidders for the project.  They no doubt did so based on previous experience, reputation, and apparent qualifications of the competing bidders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s improbable that the plaintiff had either the requisite experience, reputation, or qualifications for selection.</p>
<p>But &#8220;We black.  We&rsquo;s entitled.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Say they were &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; from bid process. Toyota says they didn&rsquo;t meet standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Japan, you must use blacks even if they can&rsquo;t do the job adequately.  If you do that it means you are not a racist.  </p>
<p>Digg? <br/>

			<p>Leave it up to blacks to complain that they were not chosen to bid on something that they were not qualified to begin with.</p>

			<p>What do you mean not qualified, they were BLACK and that is all they have to be to get to bid on projects for which they are not qualified.  Black means Qualified, even if you are not.</p>

Black modus operandi: Those people have money. We deserve to have that money. Construct a convoluted argument as to why those people should turn over their money to us. </p>
<p>This is a great example of why people don&rsquo;t want any contact with blacks. Why would you want to deal with people who will turn on you in a heartbeat?</p>
<p>Blacks destroy everything they touch, everywhere they go.<br/>

			<p>I see this all the time.  They bring trumped up phony cases to court in hopes of getting a settlement of about $250k which is basically &#8220;get lost&#8221; money.  Some companies just don&rsquo;t want to defend themselves for years in court and get bad PR at the same time.</p>
<p>If there were 10,000 Black-owned firms in Mississippi was Toyota supposed to &#8220;reach-out&#8221; to all of them and invite all of them to bid?  Well, if they didn&rsquo;t, I guess they excluded them and are therefore RACISTS.  What other logic could there possibly be?</p>
<p>What a pathetic racket.</p>

			<p>Japanese automakers wouldn&rsquo;t even put up with this nonsense if they weren&rsquo;t making so much money selling their cars to Americans.  American automakers have been so crippled by unions and diversity that we can&rsquo;t compete with these companies any more, even in our own country.</p>
<p>The saddest part is, as the latter part of the article mentions, Toyota is one of the few companies that is willing to shell out graft to &#8220;diverse&#8221; contractors.  These &#8220;diverse&#8221; leeches then target them because they know the company will settle the case out of court.</p>

<p>National Minority Supplier Development Council. Sounds official to me. Certified no less! I never heard of this group but it has such a ring to it that I am sure it has nothing to do with race hustling. <br/>

			<p>What is it with these blacks already? Do they EVER do anything for themselves or do they always just lie in waiting until someone else builds or creates something of value then DEMAND inclusion? Why don&rsquo;t they start their own Companies or build their own Nice Neighborhoods? Will enough ever be enough where they can be told YOU JUST DON&rsquo;T QUALIFY or will the government and the courts always stand behind their Entitlement To Invade?</p>

			<p>How many black owned companies are having factories being built by non-Japanese-Americans ? Japanese-Americans should &#8221; sue &#8221; all these black companies for being racists; White-Americans should do the same.</p>

			<p>Why dont people look at this the right way and stop being bamboozled by these lying inferiors. </p>
<p>Blacks, who were taken from the jungles of Africa as slaves because they had no other viable function and have been the cause of the split of the white race and its destruction after recieving trillion in welfare for the past 150 yrs, always bitch and whine about everything and how they are excluded or discriminated against? </p>
<p>So where in the hell are the African car companies? African technology? African anything? </p>
<p>Whites set up whole nations in Africa and then get taken over and slaughtered and the nations revert to 3rd world choas and jungleization in 100% of the cases and that goes for American cities and anywhere they are in numbers such as the Carribeans where slaves killed all the white owners after Lincoln and Marx arrived on the scene and did their dirt. </p>
<p>Where is the African Zulu car company where blacks could actually emply their own designing and building their own vehicles and even allow the ones in America to come there to do business or even relocate there? </p>
<p>So where the is the black African technology and modernization to give millions of jobs to blacks so they wouldnt whine and bitch about whites or yellows having companies there are supposedly excluded from? </p>
<p>Why after trillions and trillions in white free  aid and wlefare have the African nations all remained status quo living in the same poor sub 3rd world standard they always did? </p>
<p>We know Obama and his elite blacks are having a field day spending white tax dollars or going in debt because thats all they can do is sponge off whitey like they always have and always will running up the tab thanks to Bush and his neocons. </p>
<p>Does GOP liberal race traitor Lincoln know what he did? Did Lincoln intend to destroy white America and white Europe ultimately? </p>
<p>Can any white imagine how magnificant the Southern America would have been had it been allowed to continue without a preemptive war of choice by the marxist tyrant? </p>
<p>Can anyone imagine the greatness and splendor the real America in the south would have experienced had it been left alone and to split off from the very nation it created? </p>
<p>There would be no Africans in America. Slavery would have ended 150 yrs ago and they would have all been safely returned to Africa without exception and the southern government compensated the elite slaveowners for their losses although we know the ending of the terrible neocon slave economy that bankrupted half the elite anyway was doing them a favor unlike any other. </p>
<p>Ending the economically worst system ever slavery and going to sharecropping and hired help would have been a 100% blessing to the elite and to the southern America who would have prospered and grown lie noneother and this what worried the north and its marxists. </p>
<p>We must conclude this with the never before mentioned greatest sting ever and this was Lincoln and his Marxists set up the South to split deliberately intentionally willfully and wontonly. It was all a rig job folks.</p>
<p>Lincoln knew what he was doing when he was rigged into office in 1860 as SC already advised it was going to seceed and this played into the hands of the tyrants entrapment.</p>
<p>Yes, the south was allowed to split starting with SC and later the other 10 states in order to destroy them although Lincoln throught it would be a piece of cake. </p>
<p>All the 60% taxations and abuse by the north for decades on the south was intentional and meant to cause the south to seceed as they knew about John C Calhouns book and writings. </p>
<p>Like everything in DC the split of the south was rigged just like everything since the 1848 Manifesto and this includes the massive influx of neocons into America by the millions after the turn of the 2oth century, the Bolshevik war, 2 world wars, and the current wars to kill off Islam and Xianity by these same vipers. </p>
<p>Slavery was the big rig that started it all. </p>

			<p>When Ford advertises on TV it shows white workers with a black or two quickly in and out of the picture.  But when the local TV channel 5 went to the Ford plant to get picture of the actual workers who were threatening to strike.  Hardly a white face; they were almost all black, and surprising many black women.</p>
<p>Why is a Toyota a better made car than American cars?  Of course there is the Auto Union, but foreign auto companies try not to hire minorities.  When they do they are not allowed to lapse into the plantation work mode.</p>
<p>My nephew works for AT&T.;  There are three kinds of workers: a) young white men, b) old men who should retire on a very good pension, and c) blacks.  The young men work; if they don&rsquo;t they are fired.  The old men know how to do the jobs and they know all the tricks.  They make very good money and get seven or eighth week&rsquo;s vacation picking the choices time of the year.  They are a drain on the company.  The blacks are worthless goldbricks.  They foul up jobs that are the least bit complicated, and will never do more than the minimum. </p>
<p>One day he was paired up with a black co-worker.  They went to lunch together.  The black guy saw a woman he knew and struck up a conversation with her and her girl friend.  There was some ribald talk with the new girl.  When lunch break was over the black worker told his white co-worker that he had to make a booty call and would join him at the work site latter.<br/>

			<p>Perhaps the result of Fish &amp; Fisher hauling more than 1 million cubic tons of dirt for Nissan brought up some sort of questionable reliability issues that made Toyota eliminate them as potential contractors. I am in the construction business and I see this all the time. Reputation is EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Simularly with the poster who said &#8220;This is one time I favor the &lsquo;equal opportunity&rsquo; crowd. I&rsquo;m not really on their side, I just think if there&rsquo;s enough bad publicity liberals may start buying American cars,&#8221; I and a lot of others got burned by detroit and the UAW when we bought their cars in the last 3 decades. We tried Toyotas and Nissans and found them to be well built, reliable, trouble free cars for a reasonable price.<br/>
I and others will NEVER buy a vehicle from a US automaker for the simple fact that we won&rsquo;t do business with a merchant that we feel has taken advantage of us.<br/>
Again, Reputation is EVERYTHING.</p>
