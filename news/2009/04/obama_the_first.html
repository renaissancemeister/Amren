<h1>Obama the First Asian-American President?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shaun Tandon, AFP, April 27, 2009 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama made history as the first African-American president but in his first 100 days he has also shown himself to be America&rsquo;s most Asian leader yet, community members say.</p>
<p>Obama appointed a record three Asian-Americans cabinet members and quickly focused his attention across the Pacific. He invited Japan&rsquo;s prime minister as his first guest and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went to Asia on her maiden trip.</p>
<p>At home, Asian-American leaders have welcomed signs Obama will take political risks to revamp the immigration system, whose rigid rules and creaky pace are blamed by many in the community for tearing apart families.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, he has done more in 100 days than the last administration has done in eight years,&#8221; said Representative Mike Honda, who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He also applauded Obama for signing a measure giving nearly 200 million dollars in back pay to aging World War II veterans from the Philippines, who fought alongside US forces but were stripped of benefits in 1946.</p>
<p>Obama through his background &#8220;understands what it means to be inclusive and to be on the other side,&#8221; Honda said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just makes me smile and makes me proud that we have someone like him as the American face,&#8221; said Honda, who was interned as a child in a World War II camp for Japanese-Americans.</p>
<p>Obama has a deep personal connection with Asia, having spent part of his childhood in Jakarta. His sister is partly of Indonesian descent; her husband in turn is of Chinese heritage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He recognizes what it means to be bicultural or bilingual  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s something we can contribute to America rather than being seen as a potential enemy or alien,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To the dismay of some Asian-Americans, Obama initially named Richardson to be commerce secretary. Richardson bowed out due to an unrelated controversy and Obama replaced him with Gary Locke, a Chinese-American.</p>
<p>The other Asian-American in the cabinet is Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, a retired general.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bob Lee, a retired telecom executive and former chair of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American group, said he was encouraged by Obama&rsquo;s early dealings with Beijing.</p>
<p>He was hopeful that Obama would disagree &#8220;collegially&#8221; when disputes crop up with China on issues ranging from the environment to human rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every Chinese-American I know is very loyal to this country,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;But when there are problems between China and the United States it creates a very concerning picture as it spills over onto us.&#8221;</p>

<p>This type of smarmy Communist claptrap, just makes me sick to my stomach. Comrade BO is the first &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; president and General Secretary Clinton was the first &ldquo;black&rdquo; president as well. What does that leave for Chairman Carter, was he the first Iranian president of the country?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>That is to say, &#8220;Chinese-Americans&#8221; are loyal to America as long as it doesn&rsquo;t conflict with their primary loyalty, which is to China.</p>

			<p><i>At home, Asian-American leaders have welcomed signs Obama will take political risks to revamp the immigration system, whose rigid rules and creaky pace are blamed by many in the community for tearing apart families.</i></p>
<p>When Mr. Wang left the land of his birth, and his wife, kids, and extended family, flew thousands of miles to a foreign country of a different race, culture, etc., he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;tearing&#8221; his family apart.  When our government allowed Mr. Wang into our territory, it was only doing so to set Mr. Wang up at the center of a dastardly plot to &#8220;tear his family apart.&#8221;  When Mr. Wang was planning his emigration, and had absolutely no clue whether his wife, kids, and extended family would be allowed to follow him, he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;tearing his family apart.&#8221;  When our government refused to allow his wife, kids, and extended family to emigrate here, it was &#8220;tearing his family apart.&#8221;  When Mr. Wang realized his wife, kids, and extended family may never be allowed to follow him, and didn&rsquo;t immediately return to them, he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;tearing his family apart.&#8221;  When our government realized that Mr. Wang wasn&rsquo;t running back to be with his family, and STILL maliciously refused entry to his wife, kids, and extended family, it was &#8220;tearing families apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>See how it works?  It&rsquo;s really quite simple, I don&rsquo;t know why people have a hard time understanding this.</p>
<p>And there are lots of applications for this kind of logic.  Every time we lock up a murderer for his crime, we&rsquo;re &#8220;tearing families apart.&#8221;  Go on, you try it!  It&rsquo;s simple fun for the whole family!</p>

<p>Yes, and in the next breath the multicults will tells us we are all one people&hellip;&hellip;..Americans.</p>

			<p>Well, he&rsquo;s the first African-American president, and last year Newsweek reported that he would be the first woman president (http://www.newsweek.com/id/115397), so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that he&rsquo;d be the first Asian president too.  </p>
<p>But then again, Toni Morrison already dubbed Clinton the first black president, so I guess that leaves Obama as our first Asian female president?  </p>

			<p>Considering how many Chinese are being arrested for espionage against the US, Bob Lee must not know many Chinese. Mr. Obama and his handlers are all for any group, as long as it isn&rsquo;t comprised of heterosexual white males. His writings show he detests that group, a group that seemingly everyone is jealous of in way or another. That&rsquo;s the real root of their hate. </p>

			<p><i>Barack Obama made history as the first African-American president but in his first 100 days he has also shown himself to be America&rsquo;s most Asian leader yet, community members say.</i></p>
<p>And what exactly did he do? He appointed some Asians to his cabinet, made a couple of diplomatic gestures, and promised to weaken our immigration laws still further. That&rsquo;s all he did to justify this whole slobbering puff piece. </p>
<p>I also have to laugh at the obscenely absurd claim that our government is &#8220;tearing families apart&#8221; simply because we haven&rsquo;t thrown open our borders (yet) to  anyone who might even remotely show a desire to come here. </p>
<p>Another all-too-common piece of shamelessly biased reporting from a supposedly legitimate news organization.</p>

<p><br>
No, that&rsquo;s not what it means. The statement by Lee says Chinese-Americans are loyal AND if there is a negative relationship or impression about China, then it may cause a backlash against them, hence &#8216;spill over&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>This is the continual decline of America wrapped in multi-culturalism. Obama is a fool and he will be remembered as a divisive figure when he loses the next election. &#8220;Chinese-American / Japanese-American or whatever&#8221; is an oxymoron, you can not serve two masters. If these asians don&rsquo;t consider themselves as &#8216;Americans&rsquo; they are not American at all but simply foreigners taking advantage of America&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>Sure the Reps. ruined America&rsquo;s economy but Obama will absolutely destroy it. He has no idea on how to formulate good economy policy and will turn America into a meritless socialist toilet. America ruled the world when it was white but now it is multi-cultural and dying. Bringing asians, africans, muslims and mexicans into your great nation will turn it into a third world hell hole.</p>
<p>If Obama had a brain he would put up trade barriers against asian imports, restrict immigration and send illegals home and charge their countries for costs incurred.</p>

			<p>This is irony at its best.  Asians, particularly East Asians, are unashamedly racist.  They consider whites inferior, at least spiritually and culturally, and black Africans sub-human.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 11:11:  If there were a bunch of French people living here who insisted on keeping their French ways, Chose to live and work separately, discriminated against Americans, demanded access to benefits that they or their ancestors had not paid for, complained about how badly they were treated by Americans, agitated for more French to move here, and called us &#8220;Francophobes&#8221; when we objected, would anyone say that they were loyal Americans?</p>

			<p>I do believe that whites are superior to asians&hellip;&hellip;asians just work in the sweat shops making cheap textiles, their women work in the brothels of the West, their young pack shelves in supermarkets. Asians will always be doing our dirty work as their population is so large and so many still libe in poverty and they want your job. America close your borders to these infected masses.</p>

<p>Nicholas is actually right.  </p>
<p>MOST asians do work in slave labor factories, brothels, and under horrible conditions in restaurants, especially those huge, cheap Chinese buffets. in many American cities the MAJORITY of prostitutes are not black, white or hispanic but asian slave girls working hidden away in asian brothels.</p>
<p>The asian elites come to America.  We see only the Asian elites, not the great mass of worse fed than slaves laborers.</p>
<p>Comparing the American asians, who are the elites who came to America because of lack of opportunity in their own country to the poverty stricken ignorant masses they left behind; is like comparing black girls who are Links Debutantes and 5th generation Spellman College students to black girls in prison and the juvenile justice system who dropped out of school after 8th grade.  </p>
<p>We see only the Indian physicians, engineers and computer programmers.  40 percent of India is completely illiterate, never having spent even one day in school.  </p>
<p>Not one, not one new sewer system has been built in India since the 1940&rsquo;s when the British left. Most have not been repaired since the British left 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Raw Indian human waste forms islands and floats across the Pacific to the shores of Peru and Chile causing cholera out breaks every few years.  Fortunately Peru and Chile have decent public health services that catch the outbreaks before they turn into epidemics.  Their coast guards also watch out for the islands of Indian human waste floating to their coasts.</p>
<p>Maybe those Indian geniuses should go home and build one of the basic infrastructures of a civilized society, a functioning sewer system and furnish every primitive stone age village wtih functioning latrines?  Naturally we cannot expect flush toilets, but outhouses and latrines would take of some of the human waste disposal problem.</p>
<p>With WESTERN EVIL WHITE MAN&rsquo;S MEDICINE keeping more and more people alive, India is drowning in human waste the Indians are unable to dispose of properly.</p>
<p>Speaking of toilets, ask your Chinese immigrant physician or pharmacist about Chinese toilets. Basically piles of human waste crawling with maggots.  Children are afraid of the maggots.<br>

			<p>Honda sounds like a racist so I assume he is.  I&rsquo;m proud to say that I don&rsquo;t eat at Japanese restaurants because of their racist policies.  They only hire Asians and Latinos.  They exclude whites.  That&rsquo;s OK.  When my co-workers (and I work in the US Gov&rsquo;t) go out to eat, I tell them - anywhere but Asian.  All the Asian restaurants need affirmative action enforced on them so they understand it like the rest of us do.  Good riddance to them - we don&rsquo;t need them here in the USA anyway.</p>

			<p>Elreyjones, it is so true that Asian restaurants are constantly being busted for employing slave labor illegal aliens, from Asia, Mexico, or elsewhere. These asian business types know every single trick in the book, on how to get what they want from our utterly incompetent and corrupt government. It sickens me to think of the multitude of scams they get away with, as described by Margaret and others including myself.</p>
