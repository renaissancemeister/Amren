<h1>Colleges Push Tuition Aid for Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The College Board, made up of 5,000 schools and best known for its SAT college admission tests, released a report Tuesday that cites a need for federal legislation that would open up in-state college tuition, financial aid and legal status to many illegal immigrants in the U.S.</p>
<p>Speaking publicly on the issue for the first time, the board is making its push after states in recent years have moved to bar illegal immigrants from paying in-state tuition and, in some cases, enrolling in their public colleges. Public colleges typically charge students from other states much higher tuition rates than in-state residents.</p>
<p>It also comes as opponents are warning that immigration reform now could reduce already-scarce jobs and college enrollment slots in the ailing economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new area for us, but it was an easy call,&#8221; said Thomas W. Rudin, a senior vice president for the College Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under House and Senate bills known as the Dream Act, illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. as children  &mdash;  defined as age 15 and under  &mdash;  and have lived here for five years could apply to the Homeland Security Department for conditional legal status after graduating from high school.</p>
<p>Such legal status would make the immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition rates and some forms of federal financial aid. Then, if they attend college or participate in military service for at least two years, the immigrants would qualify for permanent legal residency and ultimately citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The College Board is forgetting which side their bread is buttered: How can they purport to represent the interest of students while supporting legislation that promotes more competition from illegal aliens?&#8221; said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to restrict immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the College Board&rsquo;s findings:</p>
<p>* About 360,000 illegal immigrants who have a high school degree could qualify for the tuition aid. Another 715,000 immigrants between the ages of 5 and 17 would also benefit if they are motivated to finish high school and pursue a college degree.</p>
<p>* Roughly 10 states which offer tuition aid to illegal immigrants generally saw increased college revenue by enrolling these additional students, rather than financial burdens caused by an influx of immigrants paying cheaper tuition.</p>
<p>* Only a fraction of the 65,000 illegal immigrants who graduate from high school each year go to college. Their ability to receive a higher education and move into better-paying jobs would help the U.S. economy in the form of increased tax revenue and consumer spending.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Carolina bans illegal immigrants from enrolling at any of its public colleges, and Alabama blocks them from its two-year colleges. Missouri and Virginia are also considering laws that deny enrollment.</p>
<p>At least four states  &mdash;  Georgia, Oklahoma, Colorado, Arizona  &mdash;  prohibit illegal immigrants from paying in-state tuition rates.</p>
<p>The 10 states which offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants are California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington. New Jersey is now reviewing whether to offer in-state tuition, while California is considering whether to allow immigrants to compete for financial aid.<br/>

			<p>They say they should stay here because they do jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.  If they have college degree&rsquo;s, then wouldn&rsquo;t they just be taking jobs from Americans with degrees?  What will their excuse be then?</p>

			<p>Colleges are businesses FIRST! they don&rsquo;t care where the money comes from or WHO gives it as long as the college gets it. If, after they get the money they can also double as a higher learning facility, welllll, that&rsquo;s just an extra benefit.</p>

			<p>&#8220;College Board: Tuition breaks would &ldquo;motivate&rdquo; illegals to go to college.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just read yesterday where all the schools are upping their tuition costs, because of the economic crunch.</p>
<p>Where is the remainder of the tuition amount not paid by illegals going to come from?  I doubt the US Treasury will have enough capital to bail them out, like they did for the billionaire bankers.</p>

<p>O.K. I want to make sure I understand this properly. So it&rsquo;s alright for Mexicans to cross into America without obeying the law of the land by going through proper channels so that they may &#8220;do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;, but when they do, American taxpayers are obligated to foot-the-bill to educate them so that they can get a better paying job (perhaps the very same one that the American taxpayer had) so that they may help increase the tax revenue and consumer spending?</p>
<p> Both political parties are leading white Americans to their demise. Candidates from both parties pander to minorities with the goal of remaining in their comfortable, well-paying positions. White Americans built this country. No apologies.</p>

			<p>Lawless college officials need to understand that they are in violation of U.S. immigration law and subject to prosecution for enabling the stay of illegal aliens. Illegal aliens(not immigrants) need to go home, not get more U.S. citizen taxpayer breaks. Class action lawsuits against these college officials is what is needed.</p>

			<p>As the colleges in NC have proven, in each and every &#8220;study&#8221; paid for by NC taxpayers, it is good business to enroll illegal aliens.  Even if illegals take slots that out-of-state citizens could fill, and even if illegals can&rsquo;t even work legally after all this uber education, still and all&hellip;..it&rsquo;s good business.  Fact is, colleges would attempt to educate bricks if taxpayers would fund it.  Maybe we can pay for a study on that.</p>

<p>Two responses here. 1st, vote against ANY incumbent next elections but don&rsquo;t vote for any Dem either. 2nd, The college officials DO UNDERSTAND, they just don&rsquo;t GAS, college is a business like any other.</p>

			<p>Here I am in Arizona, four classes from graduating from community college with a declared major, an MS Office certificate, and I can&rsquo;t go to my first-choice in-state school: The University of Arizona! The school is in the middle of a violent drug war, a mestizo invasion, and for the final blow, it is raising tuition 31%!<br/>
I&rsquo;ve already decided that I need to leave the state; Arizona is setting up a grim future for itself with the brain-drain that is sure to accompany the violence, cultural hijacking, and ridiculous tuition prices.</p>

			<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll agree that we should pay for the tuition of illegals if they agree to do the following.</p>
<p>1) Take lots of math, science and engineering class. None of those Hate America 101 classes that liberals like to teach.</p>
<p>2) They maintain a B average.</p>
<p>And most important.<br/>
3) Upon graduation, they go home to help make life better back there for others and never come back to America to live.  </p>
<p>Four to six years of college in order to get rid of them, would be a lot cheaper than having them stay here for the rest of their lives.</p>
