<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30311735/">Detroit Councilman Walks Away From Mortgage</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was their dream home, a two-story, four-bedroom colonial in one of Detroit&rsquo;s nicest and most stable neighborhoods.</p>
<p>But then, one day in December, City Councilman Kwame Kenyatta and his wife packed up their belongings, locked the doors, mailed in the keys and walked away  &mdash;  adding another vacant house to the thousands in a city hard hit by the nation&rsquo;s mortgage crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re already underwater when it comes to what we&rsquo;re paying on the house versus what the house is worth,&#8221; Kenyatta said.</p>
<p>Around the country, the practice, sometimes referred to as &#8220;mortgage walking&#8221; or &#8220;jingle mail,&#8221; appears to be growing. But for Kenyatta, the decision could do more than hurt his credit rating.</p>
<p>It could damage his bid for mayor of Detroit this summer, particularly since he has been one of the city&rsquo;s most vocal supporters of measures to improve neighborhoods and clean up blight.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&rsquo;m going to follow you, you need to be a leader,&#8221; said Patricia Dixon, a former neighbor of Kenyatta&rsquo;s. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t show leadership by walking away from your home in the city of Detroit. You have vandalism where they find out the houses are vacant. You have people stealing fireplaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenyatta, a Democrat, is not the only elected official facing mortgage trouble. The Wayne County prosecutor&rsquo;s Detroit home has gone into foreclosure. And California Rep. Laura Richardson nearly lost her home before she paid up delinquent home loans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Detroit, the median sales price for a home is now a pathetic $5,800, down more than $66,000 from seven years ago. An estimated 16,000 foreclosed homes are on the market in the city of about 920,000 residents. Detroit also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, at around 20 percent.</p>
<p>Kenyatta&rsquo;s former neighborhood, North Rosedale Park, is unlike most of the rest of Detroit. Stately, well-kept brick homes line quiet, winding streets. It fights to hold off blight from surrounding northwest side neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Kenyatta&rsquo;s former home is the ugly duckling on its block. Dead grass spreads gray across the lawn. Withered advertising circulars are strewn about the porch and the hedges.</p>
<p>Bought for $225,000, the home nose-dived in value to $100,000, according to Kenyatta. Its manageable $2,600-a-month mortgage soon was about to soar about $1,000.</p>
<p>About five months ago, the Kenyattas moved to a rented condo on the city&rsquo;s east side. It has three bedrooms, four baths, a whirlpool bath, finished basement and garage. The rent is less than their old mortgage. (In Detroit, City Council members are elected from the city at large, not from districts, so leaving the neighborhood does not affect Kenyatta&rsquo;s eligibility to serve.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kenyatta said that because his mortgage payments were made on time and he was not in foreclosure, he did not qualify for any relief programs through his lender.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kenyatta said he hopes voters can separate the personal from the political with the August mayoral primary approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;History will show that some of the greatest leaders who did great work for the public may not have done so good by themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In most cases, they neglect themselves to take care of the people&rsquo;s business. My record in public office, I&rsquo;m proud of it. I think I&rsquo;ve done good.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Another mayor named Kwame?  The first one worked out so well.</p>
<p><i>It could damage his bid for mayor of Detroit this summer, particularly since he has been one of the city&rsquo;s most vocal supporters of measures to improve neighborhoods and clean up blight.</i></p>
<p>I think it will help him, in a city like DirtRot full of black racist voters.  He&rsquo;ll earn &#8220;street cred&#8221; for having stuck it to &#8220;da man&#8221; and his banks.</p>

<p>A savvy realtor could buy up quite a number of these homes/properties and wait for the Chinese to move in or of course, for the muslims from the rest of the state to expand to (invade) Detroit.</p>

<p>Have any of the unemployed given any thought to moving?</p>

			<p>Detroit is the harbinger of what is to come for the rest of the country&rsquo;s major cities with a significant black population. </p>
<p>Reality is gonna be hitting us all hard within the next two years![All of us old guys here - most of whom who are smarter than I - know what is coming - strange that we all seem to be pretty much in agreement].</p>
<p>Remember Detroit when you think that a [semi] black man is going to be saving your job, your family, your property, and/or your life.  </p>
<p>Running a corporation, a city, or the country ain&rsquo;t quite the same thing as playing a game of hoops or catching a football!</p>

			<p>Cut the brother some slack. If I owed 250k on a dump that was now worth 25k, I would walk away also. The &#8221; Man &#8221; forced him to sign his name on the loan. He could have stayed on the corner of Martin Luther King and Drive By but he wanted something better. Although his loan application was right out of Bullfinch`s &#8221; Mythology,&#8221; the evil bank still went along. Of course if they didn`t the outrage of another black-lined brother with political power would have assured a fedral investigagtion of the bank.<br>
     He walked away for the result of a bad decision. He is an example that all black males will follow. Walk away from your economic responsibilities, your family responsibilites and your responsibility to obey the law. Obama will make it okay.<br>

			<p>What lack of accountability. These people just walk away from obligations.They see them selves as victims even when their own bad decisions are to blame. In my world not paying your mortgage and other debts is a source of shame. Blacks do not feel this because their own leaders advocate this behavior. Anybody who says different is a racists. </p>

			<p>Why was Mr. Kenyatta&rsquo;s mortgage about to soar?  I&rsquo;d like to think our elected officials are smart enough to avoid scams like adjustable-rate mortgages. </p>
<p>What about the money invested as down payment?  Surely the Kenyattas put at least 10% down on what they envisioned as their future nest egg?</p>
<p>My advice to the Kenyattas:  Refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage.  Additionally, Mr. Kenyatta can get a second job at night (in addition to the stellar work he does on the Detroit city council).  Money earned from this second job can be applied to pay off the principal.  After 10 years he&rsquo;ll be amazed at the amount of the loan that&rsquo;s been paid off.</p>
<p>Kwame Kenyatta owes his success in politics to honesty, thrift and hard work.  I&rsquo;m sure that had our society not been plagued with injustice, Mr. Kenyatta would have handled this situation much differently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Have any of the unemployed given any thought to moving?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Flamethrower at 10:56 PM on April 21 </p>
<p>Sorry - but I have to point out a couple items regarding this comment; If you are unemployed, you have no money to pay for that moving truck or perhaps even car.  If you are unemployed, you likely also have no money for a first, last and deposite on the rudest apartment.  If you are unemployed, when you are at last forced to move, you loose all your worldly goods, what connections you had, etc.  And every application for employment that you fill out ruins your ruined credit a little more because they can check your credit rating as part of the review process.  </p>
<p>This applies to any group and it is beginning to apply to more and more Whites.  We better soften up out attitudes a little or we may find our best potential recruits as our enemies.</p>
<p>In the town where I live there are increasing numbers of foreclosures, now in the hundreds of hundreds - not sure, but the apartments are also empty, looking for tennents.  I wonder all the time where the displaced owners are going?  In the meantime, we seem to have more foreigners arriving regardless of a shrinking local economy.  Can someone tell me what that is about - I mean who exactly is doing this to American citizens, Catholics, Lutherans, US Immigration?</p>

<p>YES to all of the above, I&rsquo;ve seen it. The churches are a #1 enemy of legal, legitimate immigration reform, since the illegals tend to go to church (pay tithing) more than us Whites so it is a matter of money to the churches.</p>
