<h1>Madonna&rsquo;s African Adoptions Part of Growing Trend</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Celean Jacobson, AP, April 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Madonna&rsquo;s efforts to adopt two youngsters from Malawi have drawn the paparazzi. But she isn&rsquo;t alone: Westerners are increasingly seeking to bring home children from Africa as traditional sources like China and Russia cut back on adoptions by foreigners.</p>
<p>The rising number of adoptions from Africa  &mdash;  particularly by Americans in Ethiopia  &mdash;  comes as the AIDS epidemic ravaging the continent leaves more orphans in impoverished countries and surviving relatives are unable to care for them.</p>
<p>Americans adopted 1,725 Ethiopian children in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2008, about 70 percent of all U.S. adoptions from Africa, according to the U.S. State Department. The year before, 1,255 Ethiopian children were adopted by Americans.</p>
<p>Thomas DiFilipo, president of the Joint Council on International Children&rsquo;s Services, does not attribute the increase to a celebrity factor, but he says some high-profile adoptions by celebrities have raised awareness of the availability of orphans in Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many adoption agencies and child rights activists argue it is preferable for children to be taken care of by relatives or in their communities, with foreign adoptions allowed only as a last resort. Others say that isn&rsquo;t always realistic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adoption experts say the rise in adoptions from Africa is due to developments in China, Russia, Guatemala and other longtime sources of orphans that have reduced the number of foreign adoptions. As a result, the number of foreign children adopted by Americans fell 12 percent last year, reaching the lowest level since 1999.</p>
<p>According to the State Department, 2,399 visas were issued to African children adopted by Americans last year, out of 17,438 adoptions from abroad.</p>
<p>China, which for a decade was the leading source for international adoptions, accounted for the biggest decline and dropped out of the top spot last year. It was replaced by Guatemala, which almost certainly will lose that status in 2009 because of a corruption-related moratorium on new adoptions.</p>
<p>By comparison, only a handful of African children were adopted by Britons in 2007, the last year for which details are available. According to figures from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the largest numbers were from Ethiopia and Nigeria  &mdash;  seven children were adopted from Ethiopia and six from Nigeria.</p>
<p>But Africa was the second-most popular region for French adoptions in 2008, making up 29 percent of the 3,271 non-French children who were adopted, the French Foreign Ministry says, after the Caribbean and the Americas. The percentage was about the same the previous year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gail Gorfe, director of the Ethiopia office of U.S.-based Adoption Advocates International, said the number of adoptions in Africa has been increasing steadily each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the exposure for Africa and adoption is growing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it is much less about the celebrities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chisale, the Malawian welfare official, said there has been a slight increase in interest in adopting children from his country, mainly among Malawi&rsquo;s many international aid workers.</p>

			<p>This trend to go for &#8220;designer babies&#8221; in other countries is very disturbing. There are tens of thousands of white American children in foster care, that Childrens Services are BEGGING people to adopt, but they would rather get foreign children from anywhere and everywhere else. I realize the adoption process is overly expensive, but when you are dealing with celebrities like Madonna, cost is not a factor. I fully realize that there are poor children all around the world that need homes, and I am not lacking in compassion for them, but I just think we should provide for our own first. Whatever happened to &#8220;charity begins at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinese and Russians are smart enough to know that the American economy will collapse this year and will not let their children be adopted by people of a failed nation. The Africans are no so smart. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s children as exotic pets to get attention. Notice that Madonna seems to pick out the coal blackest kids possible. Watch as we see photos of this exibitionist wearing all white and being accompanied by a coal black kid.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much difference psychologically with Madonna and the losers you&rsquo;ll see in every city who walk around the city streets with large snakes around their necks or with various types of birds or other creatures hanging off them.  These people bask in the &#8220;glory&#8221; of standing out from the crowd. They generally have inadequate personalities.</p>

			<p>Mentally unstable Whites go to Africa to adopt &#8220;Black&#8221; children much like a normal person would go to a pet shop to purchase a pet. The growing rage among African &#8220;Blacks&#8221; who rightly oppose this hideous racist practice is totally understandable.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know why anyone of any race would adopt a child from Africa.  If you really want to adopt a black child there are countless black children here in America who are in desperate need of families.  <br>
I am guessing that most of these people adopting African children are naive, white liberals.  No doubt they will be very confused in a few years when they can&rsquo;t figure out why their child can&rsquo;t keep up in school despite the thousands of dollars they have spent on private tutors and educational toys.  </p>

			<p>I have a nephew. He is an investment banker. His wife is a college provost. They are in their late 40s. Seven years ago, they adpopted two twin Black girls from Ivory Coast. They already have two biological White children of their own who are 18 and 15. The African girls are now 12. They are cute and well behaved and excel in the private school they attend, but I cannot wonder why my nephew decided to so. They love the girls to death.</p>
<p>In a roundaobut way I asked him and he told me that they (he an Mandy his wife)saw a save the children commerical and they felt that they had to make a diffeence in the world. I told him tht he could have adopted two white eurpoean children who had no parents. He pretty much ignored me and told me that he felt that they had made a good choice.</p>
<p>I love my nephew, but it is people like him, his wife and others who will be the cause of our race&rsquo;s demise, whether intentionally or not.</p>

			<p> Why do these White (guilt) celebrities always want to not only adopt from overseas, but preferably, adopt a black child? Guess I already answered my own question: White guilt.</p>
<p> Wonder why the press never asks Madonna, for instance: &#8220;Madonna, as there are plenty of American orphans available for adoption, why have you gone all the way to Malawi? Look in the mirror. If you want to adopt overseas, why not adopt from, say, Romania? There are many, many little orphans there, and they&rsquo;ll fit in much better with you and your husband than a baby, no matter how &#8216;cute,&rsquo; from Malawi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Personally, race aside, I wouldn&rsquo;t let a divorced woman adopt, because children need two parents.  (But it would help if the adoptive parents were of the same race!)</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  In my experience, even liberals are usually not so naive as to adopt blacks. More often they go for Chinese and Guatemalans (though they would rather die than explain themselves). Just as likely it&rsquo;s people of a universalist Christian persuasion   &mdash;   the true gold standard in non-hypocritical blindness to race.<br>

<p>Your nephew and his wife (a college provost, yuck) would get no public recognition for adopting whites. What they are after is the attention from the public or their elite colleagues they will get from having blacks. They want people to fall all over themselves telling them how noble and progressive they are. Adopting white children, the only people who would ever know would be close friends and God - and what good does that do for progressive vanity?</p>

			<p>See how easy the American sheep are lead.   They&rsquo;ve watched Oprah on TV for the last 20 years and now we&rsquo;ve got Obama.  Now they watch Madonna trying to keep her name in the news and confuse it with child adoption.   The greatest dangers America faces comes through the televion.   This is why its called television &#8216;programming&rsquo;.  The leftist self-loathing white elites in America manipulate TV to promote their radical agenda which is the destruction of America and the white majority.  Turn off your televisions!!       </p>

<p>So true.  I used to know an airhead woman like this.  She liked to adopt non-White children.  This is actually a fad among liberal White women (up-scale - usually the husband&rsquo;s hard-earned money).  They think they&rsquo;re &#8220;saving the world&#8221;.  Women are far more affected by media conditioning than men are.  This is where they learn &#8220;White Guilt&#8221;.  However men have been conditioned as well and since women are &#8220;empowered&#8221; today, it is more likely that a man will do what his wife wants rather than vice versa.  They&rsquo;re genociding their own race - and they don&rsquo;t even know it.  I don&rsquo;t even think most of these people even care.</p>

			<p>To: Rick at 8:39PM. It would be interesting to know what your nephews&rsquo; biological children think about thier african &#8220;sisters.&#8221; Were they ever even asked whether or not they wanted to share Mom and Dad with 2 complete strangers? Also, your nephew and his wife are likely to find themselves downsized or out of work soon. I don&rsquo;t see much of a future for investment banks or universities. What then?</p>

<p>Exactly, though liberals have already come up with an explanation for this. When the Minnesota transracial adoption study showed that blacks that had been adopted into white families had no higher IQ than blacks in general once they reached adulthood, and that mixed race children came in almost exactly between the black and white adopted children, they attributed it to teachers having racist expectations on the black kids, and that these expectations somehow became self-fulfilling and caused their IQ to go down. We will similarly here see liberals claim that the low IQ scores that these adopted Africans will no doubt have are the result of them living in a racist society.</p>

			<p>Your race is your extended family, and the family is the first obligation one has in regards to others. Adopting outside of your race is complete disrespect for yourself, your family, and your ancestors. </p>
<p>Adopting blacks as fashionable- doesn&rsquo;t quite make since. I mean, if you are collecting something I think that you would want something that is increasingly rare- NOT something that has been so overproduced that its producers have no room left so they are trying to offload the abundance onto stupid white liberals here in the U.S.</p>

<p>Then he is not  being loveable.  <br>
Have you made your feelings clearer to him?   Perhaps you should.  You&rsquo;re risking his affection, yes, but &#8220;our race&rsquo;s demise&#8221; is not a minor matter, you know.  It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re criticizing the color of his living room rug.<br>
 <br>
Perhaps you could show him an article from Amren. This could open a whole new perspective to him. They might find it scandalous at first.  I imagine that in the liberal-left  world that they&rsquo;re in, they are wholly unaware of any other point of view.</p>
<p>Forgive what may seem gratuitous advice. I realize it is your family business; but since you have opened up the subject, I presume you are also open to suggestions.</p>

			<p>When thinking about your &#8220;designer baby,&#8221; don&rsquo;t let yourself get sidetracked by considering an African-American baby.  Although 85% of African-American kids grow up without fathers, and even though there are tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of African-American kids with neither parent, it just isn&rsquo;t fashionable to adopt one.  </p>
<p>It is much more cool to get a real African baby from Africa.  We&rsquo;ve all seen the Lion King, and those wonderful nature shows about African wildlife.  Africa is happening, man!  No one will put your picture in the newspaper if you adopt the baby of an AIDS-infected junkie from Detroit.  But imagine the envy of your friends and family when you bring your authentic African baby (from Africa) to the party.  </p>

			<p>Gucci handbags are as yesterday as bell-bottoms.   Today&rsquo;s fashion statement is designer babies.  A designer baby (preferably from Africa) says it all:  &#8220;I care.  I&rsquo;m rich.  I&rsquo;m with it.  I&rsquo;m cool.  I&rsquo;m a special person.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t stop at one   &mdash;   collect the whole set:  This year, the &#8220;In Crowd&#8221; will be working to acquire designer babies from ALL the fashionable Third World places, including India, South America, and let&rsquo;s not forget China   &mdash;   with rapidly rising wealth in China, Asian babies may not always be available.  Get yours now, while you can, and at bargain prices.</p>

<p>The Chinese will often raise some abandoned stranger&rsquo;s kid as their own.  They adopted all the orphans from that recent Chinese earthquake.  It&rsquo;s so quaintly selfless (patriotic?) that one has to go back to WWII and those British and Jewish kids sent abroad to get an example of White people doing the same;  and, even then, many of those kids were terribly abused in Canada and Australia. <br>

			<p>Adopting children is never the same as having your own because so many personal characteristics are genetic.  Adopters should always be doing it to give a home to a needy child.  These African adoptions are more about the egos of the adopters than the needs of the child.   </p>

			<p>Adopting an African baby also speaks volumes on what liberals truly think of African-Americans. They don&rsquo;t want to deal with the all too real social pathologies of African-Americans. Since they believe those pathologies are all due to environment and there is no genetic component, they believe a baby from Africa will be untainted by the poisonous culture of African-Americans.</p>
<p>What is also ironic is that these liberals bring African children here and then teach the children that their African heritage and culture is vital to their identity? If that is the case why don&rsquo;t Madonna and liberal child collectors move to Africa and raise them there?</p>

			<p>If Madonna wants to adopt African children, then she should move to Africa to do so. I am sure she would love living in a black majority rule country such as Zimbabwe or Rwanda or Congo or&hellip;</p>

			<p>As I see it, the biggest problem is that the average IQ in every African country is somewhere in the low to mid sixties.  Children with &gt;65 IQs simply cannot succeed in school or function as responsible adults or teen agers.  Children adopted from African orphanages are not from the more intelligent middle and upper classes.</p>
<p>The great difficulty will occur when they turn 5 and are expected to get through the school system.  The special education classes are not very successful with children with IQs below 80, and a complete failure with below 70 IQs.</p>
<p>&gt;65 IQ adults are eligible for mental retardation disability, but that&rsquo;s only about $500 to $800 per month depending on the State. It&rsquo;s not enough to live on independently, especially for those with IQs of 65. So I hope these adoptive parents enjoy caring for their &gt;65 IQ adoptee for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Madonna and Angelina Jolie can afford it.  Most people can&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh splendid, yet another scheme to shlep more Blacks into America!! How about, at the very least, adopting a few of the many, many Black children languishing in foster-care and the like if one is so determined to parent Black youth?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  Just a few miles from her 10 million dollar condo in NYC there is a local city agency with hundreds of cute little black toddlers in foster care who need stable homes.</p>

Consider also that she is just divorced, doubtless an emotionally wrenching experience.  Suddenly, she needs a new child in her life!    </p>
<p>Is this like someone else who goes on a shopping spree or some other binge to work off their own inner emotional turmoil?  She shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to use a child as a &#8220;thing&#8221; to feed her emotional needs.</p>

			<p>Only Whites are infected with this racial self-destructive madness. You would never see wealthy Japanese, Chinese or other Asians or Latin Americans doing this. <br>

<p><i>The Chinese will often raise some abandoned stranger&rsquo;s kid as their own. They adopted all the orphans from that recent Chinese earthquake. </i><br>

Those were CHINESE children!   Do the Chinese travel half way around the earth to adopt Africans or Guatemalans?  Do they even adopt whites or fellow Asians?<br>

			<p>Two black kids doesn&rsquo;t eradicate a lifetime of tobacco, alcohol, pills, cocaine, morphine, and sequential liaisons with various partners of questionable values and morals. </p>
<p>Time has moved on. She can&rsquo;t go back. She wears her past on her face like a cheap perfume which no amount of plastic surgery can ever eradicate. Like Michael Jackson, she has become a caricature of her former self. </p>
<p>Were she concerned solely about the children she would not have used this opportunity for adoption for yet another publicized,  political statement. How insulting to everyone.    </p>
<p>It continually amazes me that those who have received so much, for so little, from so many, constantly complain, about so much!</p>
<p>Let it go Madonna - whoever you are. Your time in the sun ended long ago.  </p>

			<p>According to the &#8220;latest news&#8221; yesterday, her bid for the kid was rejected by a judge. She was scheduled to leave yesterday, but her plane did not take off.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the &#8220;latest latest&#8221; news today is that she is throwing a big party for Malawian government officials and that the judge is now (just maybe) willing to reconsider his decision.</p>
