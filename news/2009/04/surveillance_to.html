<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9798C9O2&amp;show_article=1">Surveillance Towers Planned for Detroit, Buffalo</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eileen Sullivan, AP, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Border Patrol is erecting 16 more video surveillance towers in Michigan and New York as part of its plans to use technology to help secure parts of the United States&rsquo; 4,000-mile northern border with Canada.</p>
<p>The government awarded the $20 million project to Boeing Co., the same company responsible for the so-called virtual fence along the U.S.-Mexico border that has come under criticism for faulty technology.</p>
<p>Eleven of the towers are being installed in Detroit and five in Buffalo, N.Y., to help monitor water traffic between Canada and the United States along Lake St. Clair and the Niagara River.</p>
<p>At present, Border Patrol agents are posted along the river to keep an eye on water traffic.<br>

I think this is a deliberate strategy.  The are blowing DHS money up north so there will be less of available down south, where&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually needed.</p>

			<p>Oh yeah, gotta stop those ILLEGAL Canadian immigrants from swimming across the border. They are so desperate to get into the United States, you know&hellip;</p>

Here in western NY, once or twice a year, the news reports on someone being caught and held by border agents. Perhaps there are thousands that aren&rsquo;t being reported.</p>
<p>If I were to try to find something positive in this, I might speculate that maybe the extra attention focusing on the northern border is being done to head off any criticism from increasing scrutiny of a future crackdown on the southern border.</p>
<p>Maybe.<br>

			<p>This is the tip of the iceburg for me.  How much more money are we going to waste and how much further into the drain are we going to drive this country, because we are too afraid of offending certain groups?</p>
<p>Oh yes, let&rsquo;s seal the Canadian border so that we don&rsquo;t offend Mexicans&hellip;&hellip;.what a joke!  I never thought the day would come for me, but I am starting to be ashamed to be associated with the term &#8220;American&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Obama is fearful of offending the dear Mexicans, so getting tough on border security now means beefing up our border with Canada where there is little problem.  65-70% of Americans demand border security and deportation of illegals but Obama doesn&rsquo;t seem to care what his own countrymen think.  Some president but then again Jorge Boosh got confused and though he was elected to represent the interests of illegal Mexicans. </p>
<p>As an anti-white ideologue he believes white people are the root cause of Mexico&rsquo;s problems much like whites are to blame for the failings of the black community.  </p>

			<p>AJ: I think you&rsquo;re on the right track. MY opinion is that &#8220;something big&#8221; is in the works. The towers / security are going to be to keep US IN, not canadians and others OUT.</p>

			<p>Are you kidding me, AJ?  Some of the nuttiest drivers I&rsquo;ve seen on metro Detroit roads were sporting Ontario license plates!  LOL  Like this one turning left from the thru lane and not the left-turn lane!</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re increasing surveillance on the border with Canada to primarily monitor Muslims.  This is because Canada has become a moronically liberal country especially toward Muslims. 9/11 was not some fluke.  It could easily happen again if we&rsquo;re not diligent.  </p>

			<p>One of the great benefits of our perpetual &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; is to maintain astronomical profits for war industries.  Boeing Inc. is not stupid   &mdash;   Even during a recession, there are still ways to scam money from the American taxpayer.</p>
<p>This is all part of the great circle of corruption: Industries give money to politicians.  Politicians give contracts to industry. Industries get rich and give more money to politicians. American taxpayers pay for both politicians and useless government programs and contracts. </p>

The unmistakable message from the (formerly) White House is:</p>
<p>Illiterate brown people with 4th grade educations and a fondness for<br>
cockfighting and drunk driving GOOD! </p>
<p>English-speaking white people with college degrees BAD!</p>
<p>Then again, maybe these new guard towers aren&rsquo;t so much to keep<br>
Canadians out as to keep Americans in. Who knows WHAT our<br>
new Emperor has in mind for us. Under Obama, the US will surely come to resemble a labor camp in which productive whites and yellows are forced to toil for the benefit of unproductive blacks and browns [i]even more than it does already.[/i] </p>
<p>How do you say &#8220;Arbeit macht frei&#8221; in Ebonics?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I disagree with this at all!</p>
<p>I am originally from Dtroit and I can tell you that the Tri-County area and Windsor, are both utterly deluged with Muslims. It may seem odd for me to take this stance, and I do understand the reasonable concerns expressed here, with regard to our unprotected southern border, but we do need to keep an eye on our northern border as well. This is particularly true in the Detroit/Windsor connect.</p>
<p>If the Buffalo, N.Y. and Niagara Falls, Ontario juncture are even remotely similar, then the same holds true.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>The only way that this country will ever &#8220;catch&#8221; a Muslim terrorist is when they continually run their mouths. It must be something in the Mid East water that makes their males brag continuously about what they are going to do   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s kind of like a teen age, high school, boy before and after his first date with a college girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we do things so right its just that they do things so wrong.</p>
<p>Towers are superfluous. </p>
