<h1>Black Man Kissing White Woman Causes Stir</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Moore, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the cover of [April 10&rsquo;s] Go! magazine, a regular section of Friday&rsquo;s Post-Dispatch,  there is a photo of a couple kissing to go along with the story &#8220;The 7 Best Places To Smooch&#8221;.  The story hasn&rsquo;t generated a ton of buzz, but the photo has. Why? Because the man is black and the woman is white. The reader comments at the end of the online version clearly showed us that at least some folks out there are not comfortable with interracial relationships.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mag Cover.jpg" src="/news/2009/04/20/Mag%20Cover.jpg" width="220" height="225" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span><br>
Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From <strong>taxpayer</strong> came this remark: &#8220;This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all. Libs take every opportunity they can to shove miscegnation in our faces. Now that TV has to show blacks in every commercial, notice that they are always posed beside a blonde woman. Not a brunette, a blonde. Its done for shock value. Sickening that a once proud newspaper would resort to this. Joe Pulitzer is turning over in his grave in shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reader <strong>greggh</strong> tried a middle-of-the-road approach:  &#8220;I&rsquo;m not judging the concept of biracial couples at all, but in a city as racially polarized as St. Louis, I&rsquo;m shocked that the PD would go so out of its way to be so gratuitously provacative. This completely undercut the message of the article.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other readers were disturbed by the negative comments including <strong>dwilliams</strong>, who wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;You people make me sick! What a disgustingly racist community we live in. My husband is black, I am white, we have beautiful children and we are both educated. We teach our children tolerance and acceptance of others, even the meth smoking, trailer park rednecks portrayed in these comments. Keep your nastiness to yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quick research tells me that 7 percent of married couples are interracial and those numbers are growing as the minority groups in this country continue to grow. Tiger Woods, Halle Barry, Derek Jeter and President Barack Obama are all products of interracial parents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 42 years since the U.S. Supreme Court knocked down a law barring interracial marriage. But today, at least in St. Louis, it seems to remain a touchy subject.<br>

<p>Just because people don&rsquo;t support mixing of the races (there are many blacks and browns and yellows that also don&rsquo;t like mixing) doesn&rsquo;t make them racist.  Educated?  Hardly.  She doesn&rsquo;t even know what the word &#8220;racist&#8221; means.  The mere mention of redneck as a response to some folks not liking or accepting interracial dating and/or miscegenation is typical of an ignoramus.  Be advised that many highly-educated whites do not like interracial dating or miscegenation anymore than our like-minded kin in the trailer parks.  She&rsquo;s not only ignorant, she is totally and irrevocably brainwashed.<br>

<p>Not just blacks, they must be black MEN and the WOMEN must be white. Maybe we should see some beautiful black women with White men?? think the black panthers would like that?</p>

The story hasn&rsquo;t generated a ton of buzz, but the photo has. </i><p>And there, in a nutshell, you have the reason that an black was posed kissing a white woman.  Our late republican society has the same sort of hysterical attitude towards race that former ages had towards sex. A same race couple posed kissing would hardly attract notice, and a white man kissing a black woman might bring howls of protest from the &#8220;black community,&#8221; but a black man kissing a white woman calculatedly titillates circulation into an upward trend, and any protests against it can be turned into a (further circulation-boosting) &#8220;badge of honor&#8221; for the magazine and self-righteous counter-protestors like &#8220;dwilliams.&#8221;</p></p>

		<p>The level of disgusting immorality in the media knows no bounds.  In a few years they&rsquo;ll be two men kissing on the cover and a decade from now it&rsquo;ll be a woman and some farm animal.  What will be even more disgusting is that people will still post in the comments sections to get with the times, redneck trailer trash, etc. if other people are nauseated by it.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The story hasn&rsquo;t generated a ton of buzz, but the photo has. Why? Because the man is black and the woman is white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ugh!!!</p>
<p>Where to begin, or a better question: what new insights can I add here?</p>
<p>I think that &ldquo;taxpayer&rdquo; and his comments cited in the above article, pretty much cover my feelings about the media&rsquo;s manipulative miscegenation predilections. Also, I think that most here who have ever read my past thoughts on the topic of that officially sanctioned interracial genocide of the white race, know exactly how I feel on that topic.</p>
<p>So what more can I write here to enlighten, or at least expand upon from above?</p>
<p>Well, it goes a bit like this: we must stop as a race, thinking of &ldquo;whites&rdquo; who engage in sexual (or any other form of) race treason and our genocide through &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; as being anything other than idiots or Reds. These are not our people, these are not our allies, these are not even considered members of our race; they are at best imbecilic runts from the back of the litter, and at worst, they are abhorrently lucid and premeditated racial defectors.</p>
<p>I could say more, but what point to it; well, other than, God help us all!<br>

		<p>True ignorance never shines stronger then when people complain or are disgusted by racist attitudes toward miscegenation. These people are so blind to the dangers and destruction of what the mixing of the races can bring, that it is useless to try and educate them. All you can do is hope that most whites remain educated and smart enough to keep the race strong.</p>

<p>Yes they are shoving these abominations right in our face and the White woman is usually a blonde because a blonde White woman is the quintessential White woman.  It&rsquo;s getting worse and worse.  I can&rsquo;t go a day now without seeing some brainwashed White girl or woman with a Black, and the terrible part of it is the White girls or woman are sometimes actually attractive and somewhat intelligent and the Black can be some Rastarian, reefer-smoking lowlife.</p>

		<p>Even though I haven&rsquo;t lived in St. Louis in the past 45 years,<br>
I still follow the daily news. </p>
<p>The crimes committed by blacks against whites has increased and the violent nature of these crimes would cause most whites with any sense of civility to distrust ANY relationship with blacks, especially black males. Most white women wind up abused or worse,read Nicole Simpson, as a  prime example. If people wish to express their outrage, it&rsquo;s part of of constitutional freedoms. The PC police would like to silence you!</p>

<p>The intolerance of the &#8220;tolerant&#8221; never ceases to amaze me!</p>
<p><i>Quick research tells me that 7 percent of married couples are interracial and those numbers are growing as the minority groups in this country continue to grow.</i></p>
<p>Actually no - paradoxically &#8220;interracial&#8221; relationships will <i>decline</i> as the number of &#8220;minority groups&#8221; grows. </p>
<p>Maybe the number of black-white relationships will grow, but it&rsquo;s also probable that other ones will <i>decline</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tiger Woods, Halle Barry, Derek Jeter and President Barack Obama are all products of interracial parents.</i></p>
<p>Note: It&rsquo;s interesting how so many &#8220;biracial&#8221; (black father/white mother) celebrities grew up without said father.</p>
<p>Anyway, at least they haven&rsquo;t blocked/deleted those comments yet.</p>

		<p>From reading many of the comments posted in the original story, it appeared that only a few commentators were <b>not</b> in favor of the published bi-racial smooching photo, yet those few were set-upon by the scowling majority for being &#8220;narrow-minded&#8221; with the usual smears and jeers thrown in to add insult. But who knows what amount of editing out went on beforehand. </p>
<p>The <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> newspaper saw an opportunity to stir up a hornet&rsquo;s nest with this controversial photo, so they took it.</p>
<p>In response to some of the more liberal comments, I&rsquo;m always reminded of Tom Sunic&rsquo;s quote that went some like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans confuse the dreary recitation of politically-correct gibberish with sensitivity that they think they have arrived at through their own value clarification&#8221;.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between two people falling in love without any outside forces&hellip;&hellip;and the media trying to shove/brainwash/promote a social engineering project.  The reason why they target blondes is because &#8216;blondes&rsquo; are the most immediately visible &#8216;white&rsquo; and all things white need to be destroyed.  </p>

		<p>If the mainstream ever got up enough nerve to look on the internet, they would find some real disturbing film clips with very racial and anti-White sexual content.  That this even exists shows what this photo and all the rest of the sex for sale - race for sale sickness that is out there.</p>

		<p>I live in this rather woebegone city of St. Louis, and when I saw that picture, I just shook my head and thought, &#8220;same old thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The extremely leftist Post-Dispatch is always promoting their agenda.</p>
<p>The Post has become a worthless rag, anyway.</p>
<p>I believe several years ago they discovered that few Afro-Amers. read the paper.  (No shock there, if you ask me.)</p>
<p>Of course, they decided it had to be <i>their</i> fault.</p>
<p>So to &#8220;rectify&#8221; the situation, they began featuring pictures of black people (usually on the front page) almost every single day.</p>
<p>Often these are pictures of &#8220;students,&#8221; usually quite young ones.  I get a nice laugh every now and then as I look at their faces as they &#8220;study&#8221; biology or computers.  It looks like the teachers aren&rsquo;t quite getting through to them.  Like I say, it can be funny.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they did recently take that vile &#8220;Boondocks&#8221; comic strip out of the paper.</p>

		<p>It is innate that common sense people recognize that superior genes should not interbreed with inferior genes.  There is a world wide conspiracy to dilute the superior genes by constant brain washing that it is cool to have miscegenation.  Inferior genes should only be allowed to reproduce within their own ranks and at a lower ratio to superior genes.  The inferior genes are the worker bees in society instead of being artifically elevated to positions beyond their capabilites.  Unfortunately, there is always a natural tendency toward chaos.  The ancient Aryans in India tried through a caste system to try to prevent interbreeding with inferior genes but to no avail.  </p>

		<p>I often complain to the editors, producers and advertisers when I see this kind of provocative trash.  I know I&rsquo;m not the only one as several high-profile examples were quietly pulled:  &#8220;Doctor Who&#8220;&#8216;s paki BF for the lovely blonde co-star; Comcast Cable&rsquo;s blatantly dark-as-africa black with golden blonde wife, to name two that went down the memory hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to the point where, at 44 years of age, I have had it to my eyeballs with my own sense of politeness and propriety being used against me, almost as a self-mockery.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that she is pulling him in to kiss. The race mixing media would not depict a bacl man being aggressive towrds a white woman , atleast not for a few years yet!</p>
<p>I honestly do not agree that interracial kids are good looking, since most are not . If you see white kids with just a little black in them, they are often obese and not attractive and they have kinky and crazy hair .</p>
<p>The old saying &#8220;once black never back &#8221; has had it&rsquo;s meaning flipped to the opposite . It meant that once you have black blood, you&rsquo;ll never return to being white. </p>
<p>Blacks should oppose race mixing as should whites ( and many do)<br>
since, every person should be proud of their race so that they should not like to see their race being altered .</p>

		<p>They closed the comments. Some of the comments I saw at the link provided shows this overwhelming  sentiment that it doesn&rsquo;t matter since we are living with increasing miscegenation. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as they are in love. This is the sickening mentality that has taken over Whites and non-Whites alike(to a smaller extent). They don&rsquo;t understand things like regression to the norm and the fact that miscegenation is immoral for a host of reasons(such as increased conflict, psychological problems etc.). Whenever I hear Whites excuse interracial marriage by stating something like &#8220;That it is fine because my husband and I are educated and we teach are kids to be respectful of all races&#8221;, they don&rsquo;t get their kids will likely become more primitive and downgrading the future of their kids. And if it does not happen in the first generation, it will happen in future generations with future grandchildren. And if they do accept it as reality, why would they do it? Why would anyone take such a dangerous risk? And even if one does not have kids you are clearly setting a bad example by reproducing with others of a different race since human beings are social creatures that are more likely to do something when other people do it even when it is bad. White people who marry Black and Brown people are replicating the immoral and backward behavior that has occurred many times in human history in previous civilizations such as in Ancient India and Ancient Egypt.Since it is modern, it must be good. Since people like the look of brown, it must be good. Is it any wonder why Western civilization is collapsing. People don&rsquo;t understand genetics and history. Everyone makes me sick with their anti-moral or moral relativist remarks.

		<p>Just this weekend at a conference I saw a picture of a mixed couple displayed in the showroom of the conference hotel&rsquo;s wedding planning office. Funny how &#8220;mixed couple&#8221; always seems to go only one way: Black male, non-black female. Heaven forbid they portray something as distasteful as a white male with anyone at all!</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t bother me that much in and of itself, but why is it necessary? What exactly is the point they&rsquo;re trying to make? Is it against the law nowadays to advertise ANYTHING without showing at least one black in the illustration?</p>

		<p> I think most people of all races are uncomfortable with it. Even with the decades of the media pimping for these relationships, they are still only seven perecent. That is because we all know inside that it is wrong. Most people want children that look like them. Its natural, its human and its not wrong!</p>

		<p>Although many here think that the blatant assault on whites is bringing us closer and closer to some kind of violent revolt I have sadly concluded that most whites will settle for a kind of internal exile. They&rsquo;ll go on living their lives to the best of their ability within the traditional modes, one of which is sane race separation. But they will give up trying to fight the official culture. They will live their whole lives under the radar, so to speak. The official culture will go on confidently blaring its lies. We may end up with only 20 or 25% of the population believing the lies and 75% in opposition. But the 25% will rule. Basically the great majority of white Americans will live as slaves. As long as they keep their mouths shut they&rsquo;ll be safe&hellip;albeit taxed to death to support the lie.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;ll find that comment as incorrect as it is stupid! Increasingly white people (both sides of the Atlantic) see miscegenation as a sign of a failing society - no pride, no self-esteem, no identity and no respect for their own history/culture . A great nation in decline.</p>

<p>The media tries to make everyone think white women love black &#8220;men,&#8221; but in reality it&rsquo;s actually a minority made up of fat, ugly, and/or trashy white women. If you&rsquo;ve seen a lot of mixed couples, you know the type I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>On the contrary. As the reaction to this cover shows and the reason the comment section had to be shut down is that racial awareness is as healthy as ever. </p>
<p>That you believe racial awareness is dying or will ever die only reveals your self delusion. What you want to believe is true and what is true are two different things.</p>

<p>I agree, <br>
It&rsquo;s not ONLY that the immediate bi-racial kids are less attractive and less intelligent, it&rsquo;s that the genes are thrust into the community and will pop up in future generations. </p>
<p>You can see black genes in southern Italians or Portugese, their societies mixed with blacks and they became mediocre and the lowest amongst Europe  where they were once leaders, other European countries ramained much more white and therfore much more successful .<br>

		<p>To the poster who saw a picture of a black male/white female in a hotel showroom, a good way to cause a little trouble for them would be to turn political correctness  against them.  For instance, you could say: Why do you always feature black men with white women?  Don&rsquo;t you know that this is a stereotype?  Are you implying that black women are not beautiful enough to attract a black man? I know many black women who are very angry with black men who reject them for white women.</p>
<p>Of course if they depicted white men with black women, the black brothers would express their outrage in no uncertain terms, maybe even in violent language.</p>
<p>This would really get them in a dither.  They wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do and would then keep away from inter-racial depictions completely.</p>

		<p> One thing I have noticed in reading blogs here and elsewhere about racial matters is that the so-called &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; people today are much more likely to spew hatred of those who disagree with them, are much more likely to call them vile names, and even to wish them physical harm   &mdash;   typically, to be beaten up by a gang of blacks   &mdash;   than the people who don&rsquo;t approve of miscegenation.</p>
<p> The &#8220;tolerant&#8221; people are likely to say that it&rsquo;s &#8220;sad&#8221; that we are still so &#8220;intolerant&#8221; in the &#8220;21st Century.&#8221; No, what is really &#8220;sad&#8221; is that our school systems have managed to so thoroughly brainwash so many young White people into complacently approving behavior that dilutes their own racial bloodlines. </p>

		<p>Miscegenation means a million years of evolution wasted. Their hybrid children will very likely be of lower intelligence and morally impulsive than themselves. They&rsquo;ll divide and destroy their extended family as they lose their support network. And now we know that interracial marriages produce a spousal homicide rate 7.7 times higher than normal marriages.  </p>

		<p>By my personal observation, I&rsquo;d say that at least 80 percent of Black/White couples are Black male/fair-haired female.  If these couples were the result of Cupid&rsquo;s random arrows there would not be such a numerical disparity, therefore, there is something else going on, as any honest observer of society will admit.  That something else is the Black man&rsquo;s desire to steal the White man&rsquo;s women, and the desire of these White women to humiliate themselves and their families.  If there were no non-Whites available, these women would seek out some other form of degradation.  <br>
     If I am mistaken, I&rsquo;d like to hear some other plausible explanation for this sexual/racial imbalance.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great point Jerry because the controlled media work on our unconscious minds with these images.  It&rsquo;s like this particular deracinated White woman is saying, &#8220;This is MY choice&#8221;.  And you have to be deracinated just to pose in a photo like this.</p>

<p>He looked just plain black to me. Doctor Who himself had a black companion, Martha, for a few seasons. In one episode, Doctor Who is introduced to a new companion after Martha. The whole episode made a comedy out of it. Showing Doctor Who (or at least the audience), apparently having a hard time going back - as they say.  </p>

The ancient Aryans in India tried through a caste system to try to prevent interbreeding with inferior genes but to no avail. </p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 8:04 PM on April 20 </p>

 <br>
          Anonymous, </p>
<p>          Your claim is utterly flawed.  First of all, the<br>
          Ancient Aryans of India were pure-blooded INDIANS<br>
          native to northern India, as mentioned in the Rig-Veda</p>
<p>          They were NOT outsiders at all and they were not White<br>
          at all.   Sorry to burst  your bubble pal.  </p>
<p>          As for the existence of the Caste System, it is <br>
          based on the concept of innate abilities/qualities<br>
          and the occupation that one does.  Sort of like a <br>
          system of guilds that existed in Europe.   </p>
<p>          Nowhere is the Caste system equated with race or <br>
          skin color in its organizational set-up as per the<br>
          Hindu literature.  </p>
<p>          The Sanskrit language doesn&rsquo;t have a specific word<br>
          for &#8220;Race&#8221; unlike in European languages.    </p>

            Most of the White posters here including the <br>
            ignorant Indian (Gaurav Ahuja)above have no <br>
            knowledge about the Caste System.  </p>
<p>            They assume that Caste is the same as Race and that<br>
            it is something like a Racial system which simply is<br>
            laughable.  The problem with this belief is that it<br>
            is not supported by the actual sources of this <br>
            system (ie. the Hindu Sanskritic Literature).</p>
<p>            The Caste system is a system of Division of Labor<br>
            on the basis of abilities and occupation.  There is<br>
            no such thing as a higher or lower caste because <br>
            the emphasis is on the resposibilities and duties<br>
            of the individuals of a particular caste to the <br>
            greater society that it is part of.</p>

		<p>Far from being ignorant, I am a college professor with a Ph.D. from a prestigious university.  It is because I am not ignorant that I find miscegenation repugnant.  All cultures and peoples have a right to exist, and the leftist media, by promoting miscegenation, are advocating genocide  &mdash;  the end of whites and their civilization.  Far from being a matter of love, the promotion of miscegenation is pure hate  &mdash;  of the most bitter, racist type  &mdash;  the desire for a people&rsquo;s annihilation.</p>

If two people from different races want to get together, they have every right to do so; and no one has the right to deny those who wish to mix and mingle their God-given right to do so.</p>

		<p>British Airways (BA) on their animated information video for passengers (what to do if the plane crash lands, etc.) shows an inter-racial couple (Yes, of course the man is Black, the woman white with red hair, and their child mixed race).</p>
<p>I wrote to BA explaining that showing such a couple was (a) unrepresentative because the vast majority of couples marry within their own race group and (b) that it didn&rsquo;t promote racial equality but instead strongly endorsed multiculturalism, a position that the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t agree with, and that BA was therefore taking an extremist political position and foisting it on their customers. </p>
<p>Last time I was on BA it was still there. My next flight, which I have already booked, is not with BA. Multiculturalism just cost them $1000.</p>

		<p>Black men with white women also ticks off black women. Positively enrages them. Black women know that they can go to college hold a steady job, try to court a black man that is less retarded than average, and he will probably end up ditching her for some girlfriend anyway and maybe even a white women. </p>
<p>Black women have a very strong feeling against race mixing. They see is as treason. They see black men who go gay the same way, as race traitors. </p>
<p>Probably people here know about the &#8220;thing&#8221; blacks have with white women brushing their hair, especially if it is blond. That image drives them to a high pitch of anger and jealousy for some reason. I have a theory about that. I think on some higher level, blacks perceive a white woman combing out her hair as a spiritual metaphor for brushing out the burrs so to speak. Brushing the hair can also be a metaphor for Fate or the unseen hand that rules the cosmos. </p>

<p>I honestly do believe that love between any two people is something I would never get in the middle of.  But there is a difference between that and what the PC Police State is doing.</p>
<p>Their mindset is, you only have to be non-White and you are above criticism.  This is the Culture of Over-simplification gone Insane!  And it is justified on Moral grounds!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>This is why Wall Street, Big Business, Big Oil, and the Warmongers among us, put BO in the White House, ie; to hide a multitude of sins that they have no intention of putting a stop to.  BO provides political cover for them.  But I am convinced it is going to backfire.   The Power Elite today is motivated by Hatred that is fuelled by misrepresentations and lies.  They will do anything to keep from being exposed, obviously.  We just have to keep talking to each other, supporting each other, and understanding one another (in the best sense of that word) so we can develop the anti-bodies to protect ourselves from excessive exposure to their soul sickness.<br>

<p>   I guess that means I&rsquo;m a &#8220;trailer park redneck&#8221; because I dislike such interracial relationships. People have the freedom to have relationships with whomever they like, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to approve or &#8220;celebrate&#8221; their personal choices. The privileged media elites love to seek acceptance, as well as approval, for black/white intermixture because they believe in the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. Countries like Brazil, Egypt and India show the results of widespread racial intermixture. Are these countries really that attractive to more thoughtful people?

		<p>&#8220;Sardonicus you dork,Indians are NOT a mixed people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above statement is incorrect.  From what I&rsquo;ve read (and please, if there is an expert out there correct me), 3,000 years ago, India was inhabited by primitive, dark-skinned people who had originated in southern Asia.  They were then invaded and conquered by numerous successive waves of &#8220;Indo-Europeans&#8221; and Asians, including Mongols   &mdash;   and some parts were conquered by light-skinned Arabs.  At first, the new Indian societies consisted of the light-skinned ruling invaders and the dark-skinned &#8220;subjects.&#8221;  However, over the centuries, more and more interbreeding produced a variety of skin colors.  To preserve their blood line and power, the light-skinned rulers then set up a very race-based caste system, where the highest castes were the light skinned rulers, derived from the invaders, and the lowest castes were the dark-skinned original inhabitants. <br>
   Today, although there is still a gradation of light- to dark-color as one moves from North India to South India, by-and-large, extensive race-mixing has blended all the races.  Hence, the original conquering races are no longer in existence   &mdash;   their unique genotype has been completely swallowed up by that of the original inhabitants.  This is a reoccurring theme in the history of humans.  Again   &mdash;   please tell us if this is incorrect. </p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid that this &#8220;dork&#8221; can&rsquo;t agree with you. I agree with Mr.Gaurav Ahuja that the caste system was originally based on race. It is disingenuous to claim that Indians are not very color conscious. Most Bollywood actresses and actors are European looking with light complexions. You can even see the gradations of color from North to South Indian with the Punjabi look being the ideal Indian type. I&rsquo;ve seen some Punjabi women that resemble Sophia Loren &mdash; every beautiful women indeed. </p>

		<p>What frightens me most about the photo, and other images like it, is that it sets white women up as targets.  Targets for rape, targets for &#8216;boyfriends&rsquo; who turn out to be enslaving pimps: or maybe they will just be targets for sweet-talking, girlfriend-impregnating highschool jocks, who will turn out to be the kind of worthless husbands who leech off their wives, before finally deserting their families (the usual pattern, it seems, when white women marry black men&hellip;you know, like the &#8216;fathers&rsquo; of Halle Berry and Barak Obama).</p>
<p>I would like to address the assertions of certain posters, that &#8216;racists&rsquo; are people who live in trailers, smoke meth, and are &#8216;ignorant&rsquo;.  Instead of generalizing about others, I will offer myself as an example of the &#8216;racists&rsquo; who post here.</p>
<p>My mother was a Debutante, my father was a member of the best fraternity at his college, and our immediate ancestors typically inhabited archetypal Mississippi mansions with third-floor ballrooms.  The men were educated in New York or Europe, and the women sere sent to &#8216;finishing schools&rsquo;.  Our more distant ancestors were Norman Engilsh aristocrats and Swiss Huguenots.  Beyond that, we have documented lines of descent from signers of the Magna Carta, Holy Roman Emperors, Senators of pre-Imperial Rome, and the kings of Judea.  The likelihood of such an ancestry&rsquo;s producing stupid descendants is rather low.  It happens, but seldom.</p>
<p>The Kennedy/Johnson &#8216;Great Society&rsquo;, following the Civil War, the Boll Wevil, and the Cotton Panics, succeeded in wiping out most of our &#8216;family money&rsquo;.  However, my parents&rsquo; generation, and my own, have recovered our standing to some extent.</p>
<p>While my house is smaller than I would like (Marble House, in Newport, is what I&rsquo;d prefer.), it is within the wealthiest city, and the wealthiest county in our state.  I have never inhabited a trailer, nor has any member of my family.  I take that back: one uncle did rent an Airstream for a semester, while he was in Pre-Med.</p>
<p>No one smokes crack in our house.  No one smokes ANYTHING in our house.  Nor do they consume alcohol or eat meat.  We are vegetarians, and mostly buy Organic.  We have no domestic servants, and maintain the grounds of our home ourselves.  We wash our own cars, iron our own clothing, and put an atypically high percentage of our income into investments.  We have no pets.  Our social life is limited.  Our workdays are long.  And we long ago severed our religious affiliations, having wearied of hearing &#8216;one-worlder&rsquo; garbage coming from the pulpits.</p>
<p>When I was a toddler, I went to the most progressive nursery school in the university town where my parents then lived (my Stepfather had taught Chemical Engineering, before opening his first factory). Later, I went to the best of three private schools in our town, and have eight years of college. My husband is in one of the top two professions.  Our children have, or are getting, professional degrees.</p>
<p>I prefer to think of myself as a &#8216;realist&rsquo;, rather than as a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. But I became a racist/realist as a result of having grown up in an extremely diverse community. I got to observe the differences from close range.  I experienced my first persecution for being a white Protestant while in private school, from a marginally-white, non-protestant Principal, who went out of his way to promote students of his own religion/ethnicity, and to discredit Protestant and Jewish students.</p>
<p>I doubt this will dislodge certain individuals&rsquo; preconceptions regarding &#8216;racists&rsquo;.  But it was worth a try.</p>

		<p>I feel that white women should be aware of the consequences of interracial realtionships &hellip;..<br>
-Their odds of getting stds are much higher.<br>
-Their kids won&rsquo;t look like themselves .<br>
-Their kids will probably be less intelligent than pure white kids.<br>
-Their relationship has a VERY much greater likelihood of failure<br>
-Many people will not apporove of their interracial rel.<br>
-It&rsquo;s made to be fashionable now, but, fashions come and go&hellip;.<br>
-In all likelihood if they have mullatos, they will be left by their black man and VERY VERY FEW white men will have anything to do with them .<br>
-Most black women will despise them .<br>

		<p>There is a lot of attention given to white women who date non-white men. It looks like they are the biggest race mixers but thats not the truth. White males are the worst race mixers they created Brazil, Latin American, and the blacks we see today. I see white women almost exclusively dating black men. I see white men with women of every ethnicity. I live in Chicago and you can&rsquo;t go out without seeing whitemen with asian or black women although most of the time the woman is asian.  In Chicago race mixing is the worst, we have to compete with every ethnicity for our own men. White men think its so cool and exotic to be with a non-white. They like to walk aorund like: hey look at me, look how tolerant and progressive I&rsquo;am.<br>

unlike Brazilians or Egyptians in the history<br>
so what are you talking about about Indians <br>
mixed??? <br>

<p>Indians are distant cousins to whites, my friend, as well as other ethnicities that were prevalent in their geographical area throughout history.  Early inhabitants of what is now India were white Caucasians. </p>

<p>As one of my employees told me the other day when discussing miscegenation and white women&rsquo;s starring role in that travesty- &#8220;If you go black, we don&rsquo;t want you back.&#8221;  And that is the reality for the hunderds of thousands of white women who have been knocked up by black men in the last forty years.  Black men want them only as casual sex partners while white men want nothing to do with them.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;You people make me sick! What a disgustingly racist community we live in. My husband is black, I am white, we have beautiful children and we are both educated. We teach our children tolerance and acceptance of others, even the meth smoking, trailer park rednecks portrayed in these comments. Keep your nastiness to yourself!&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Racism means the desire to feel superior to another race and the desire to oppress another race based on that. It&rsquo;s  rare  today for white people to think like that. However, dating and marriage are very personal things and the truth is most people of all races prefer to date and marry within their own race as is evident that only 5% of couples of any race are interracial.  Just because one believes in sticking with their own race when it comes to marriage doesn&rsquo;t make them a &#8220;meth smoking trailer park redneck&#8221;. How absurd.</p>

		<p>People should not assume that the interests of black people and white people are the same on this matter.  I would think that it would be in the interest of blacks to seek to mate with whites, as their offspring will generally be more intelligent and have other positive traits (such as lighter skin) that will separate them from other blacks.  I would think that these genetic benefits would outweigh any problems caused by having family from disparate backgrounds.   </p>
<p>Regarding white interests, I agree miscegenation should be discouraged, and also that the visceral disgust many whites feel is a healthy sign of an instinct for racial/ethnic preservation.  But we shouldn&rsquo;t be critical of individuals who due to fate or personal circumstances have wound up married to someone of a different race.  There are all sorts of behaviors that we could not tolerate as a society on a wide scale, but that ought to be tolerated in small quantities.</p>

<p>I think we should accept that a VERY small percentage of our people are going to miscegenate, and that at least half of this very small percentage will regret it, since the violence level in mixed marriages is SEVEN times that of non-mixed marriages.</p>
<p>The problem is that the press is our enemy, and promotes this unfortunate practice, by a VERY SMALL percentage of our people,  as though it were the norm.</p>
<p>Americans, who pride themselves on self-reliance, are in fact some of the most sheep-like people in the world.</p>
<p>When I was in Europe, I saw a very small percentage of mixed-race kids and families, all over, even in Germany, but I was not too upset because the number of blacks in Europe is small, and they seem to be top-quality, European in spirit &hellip; for now.</p>
<p>France has these big camps of non-White immigrants, which the French do not like, near Paris, and the unemployment rate among them is forty percent. The French are proud and intelligent people, in a quiet way, so I am confident they can and will deal with this problem.      </p>

		<p>Good heavens!  This piece certainly stirred the pot.  I suspect that many of the more strident comments originate with the hard reality that, overwhelmingly, whites don&rsquo;t find black Africans attractive.  Many consider most of them even repulsive, at least in terms of sexual allure.</p>
<p><br>
Many of these same whites (especially men) find East Asians, Indians, and Amer-Indians extremely attractive in many cases.<br>
White sexual preferences don&rsquo;t appear to be altogether racist.  Rather, they&rsquo;re mainly a function of the universal standards of human beauty being underrepresented among black Africans.  It ain&rsquo;t their fault.  It&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>

		<p>You guys don&rsquo;t deserve much sympathy. You complain about race mixing and black men&rsquo;s desire for white women, but conveniently forget that the largest interracial coupling in the USA is WM/AF. How do you think Asian guys feel about that? The population of East Asian males in America is small, and they are also heavily stereotyped against. They get no help from the media, in fact, it&rsquo;s clearly against them. Does this sound familiar? It should be, because those same thoughts are reflected in many of the comments by White men on this forum. Congratulations, welcome to the Asian man&rsquo;s world. Bare in mind, you&rsquo;re still looking on. You haven&rsquo;t even stepped in yet. The fact that men from the -majority- culture are even complaining about things like this speaks volumes about how much America has changed.</p>
<p>PS. For a race that mixes to the extent it does with Asians, and yet still denounces them, I find it perplexing. I&rsquo;d ask you to make up your minds and form some sort of consistent, general consensus, but somehow I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s possible.</p>

Exactly. There is a lot of self-deluding going on in AR and other similar sites. It is not actually the women, but in fact the men who engage in most race mixing. Women get blamed and it&rsquo;s a big part of why WN doesn&rsquo;t have many females at all. Until the white men on here start acknowledging the truth, the problem will remain status quo or get worse.   </p>

<p>https://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/a-conversation-about-race/</p>
<p>It featured the cover of that Friday mag, and a couple of (presumably) white conservatives made critical comments.  White conservatives are always making critical comments on racial issues, why the P-D is making a big deal out of this is anyone&rsquo;s guess.  Also something to consider is whether white conservatives really did make these comments, perhaps they were liberal provocateurs or P-D astroturfers.</p>

<p>Wow! It didn&rsquo;t take long for a gaggle of posters to put the blame for miscegenation where it seems to belong and ALWAYS belong for any societal problem in our modern multicultural society: on the <b>WHITE MAN.</b>  These posters even seem to have personal knowledge that the white men posting on this forum all have non-white wives and girlfriends, and are simply hypocritically denying white women the same pleasures they allow themselves.  True &#8220;white [male] supremacists&#8221;!<p>But here are some facts: for some reason, according to a study I read just the other week in the NY Times, Asian women are so willing to date white men, that a white man can earn $24,000 <i>less</i> in annual salary than an Asian male and still be preferred by an Asian female (in all other cases, it told <i>more</i> in earnings for a male outside of a female&rsquo;s race to appeal to her).  Asian women, in other words, seem to be &#8220;easy pickings&#8221; for white men.<p>Yet the fact is that, race conscious or not, most white men still pair up with white women, and vice versa.   The point under discussion is the lengths to which our media and culture czars go to promote black male-white female pairings in poses such as the one accompanying the subject article, the SuperBowl commercial from about four years ago (that the late Samuel Francis acerbically commented on) involving a towel clad white woman accosting a black football player in the locker room, and numberless movies and TV shows of the last 50 years or so.  <p>Part of the object, as I said, is simply vulgar titillation and presumed concomitant market share increase, but another part is the conscious degradation of white women and the humiliation of white men.  That&rsquo;s why the cover under discussion did not feature a white man bussing a sloe-eyed, saffron-skinned, black-haired maid, even though that&rsquo;s what so many here would like to talk about instead.</p></p></p></p></p>

In fact, in private, many of them bitterly complain about how White men date, have sex with and are taking their women away from them. </p>
<p>They do not like it. Trust me.</p>

		<p>The mindless masses take their cues from the media.</p>
<p>Hollywood is ramping up the anti-white propaganda.  Whites are portrayed as the embodiment of moral corruption in films like &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo; &#8216;Doubt&rsquo; or &#8216;Crossing Over&rsquo;, while non-whites are given sympathetic treatment.  </p>
<p>Media propagandists have pretty much closed the coffin on the white race, and are enthusiastic at seeing its passing. White women (and men) in interracial relationships are displayed to us, the implication being that it&rsquo;s &#8216;progressive&rsquo; to micegenate.   </p>

		<p>     From a consistent point of viw, White Male/Minority Female<br>
pairings are equally wrong. Ditto from a moral or spiritual <br>
point of view. But from a Biological point of view, male out<br>
breeding is just not as serious as female out breeding-as long<br>
as the offspring remain with the mother. Traditional Society<br>
recognized this distinction without endorsing it-it just wasn&rsquo;t<br>
talked about. Of course, since we are no longer clearly the dom-<br>
inant race in this society, we can no longer dictate that such<br>
offspring be segregated. And plus scace resources would have to<br>
be given to the mother and child and away from the White Spouse<br>
and White Children. So it becomes an increasingly bad bargain<br>
for both White Men, Women, and Children.</p>

		<p>The above statement is incorrect. From what I&rsquo;ve read (and please, if there is an expert out there correct me), 3,000 years ago, India was inhabited by primitive, dark-skinned people who had originated in southern Asia. They were then invaded and conquered by numerous successive waves of &ldquo;Indo-Europeans&rdquo; and Asians, including Mongols  &mdash;  and some parts were conquered by light-skinned Arabs. At first, the new Indian societies consisted of the light-skinned ruling invaders and the dark-skinned &ldquo;subjects.&rdquo; However, over the centuries, more and more interbreeding produced a variety of skin colors. To preserve their blood line and power, the light-skinned rulers then set up a very race-based caste system, where the highest castes were the light skinned rulers, derived from the invaders, and the lowest castes were the dark-skinned original inhabitants. <br>
Today, although there is still a gradation of light- to dark-color as one moves from North India to South India, by-and-large, extensive race-mixing has blended all the races. Hence, the original conquering races are no longer in existence  &mdash;  their unique genotype has been completely swallowed up by that of the original inhabitants. This is a reoccurring theme in the history of humans. Again  &mdash;  please tell us if this is incorrect. </p>

<p>           Anonymous, </p>
<p>           Actually you are incorrect completely.  Three <br>
           thousand years ago, the people of India were not<br>
           primitive at all.  They had one of the earliest and<br>
           most sophisticated Urban civilizations on the earth<br>
           (ie. the Indus Valley Civilization).  That <br>
           civilization was bigger than Egypt and Sumer <br>
           combined.   Recent archaeological excavations have<br>
           in fact shown that there was Urban civilization in<br>
           India some 10,000 years ago, around 8000 BC!   </p>
<p>           It was on the BBC a couple of years ago, I remember.</p>
<p><br>
           As for the Indo-European invasions/migrations, its <br>
           debatable and not exactly a confirmed fact.  There <br>
           is no hard evidence showing that there was any <br>
           invasion around this period (1500 BC).  The decline<br>
           of the Indus Valley Civilization is attributed to <br>
           climactic/ecological reasons, not invasions/<br>
           migrations.  The Aryan Invasion theory is largely<br>
           based on an outdated 19th-century assumption of <br>
           linguistic speculation that is not supported by <br>
           other branches of Science.  In fact growing research<br>
           and the evidence reject this theory totally.    </p>
<p>          <br>
           Most of the invaders you mention as having invaded/<br>
           &#8220;conquering&#8221; India never actually did so!  You are <br>
           confusing India/Indian history with that of Pakistan<br>
           and Afghanistan.   For example, the Persians never<br>
           went beyond east of the Indus river, neither did<br>
           Alexander&rsquo;s forces nor even the Arabs.  The Arabs <br>
           were systematically defeated and kept in check by<br>
           the Indian forces.  The Hun invaders were also <br>
           repelled, as also the Scythians eventually.   </p>
<p>           You are mistaken about the Mongols conquering India.<br>
           It never happened.  In fact the Indians repulsed<br>
           the Mongols several times.  The Mughals were not<br>
           Mongols but Central Asian Turkic.  But even these<br>
           guys were defeated in the final round by the Indian<br>
           Marathas around 1730 AD.     </p>
<p><br>
           Indians are basically people living East of the <br>
           Indus river.  India is known as the land that lies<br>
           East of Indus, hence the name.  Overwhelming <br>
           majority of the invaders were repelled and confined<br>
           to the frontier areas like Pakistan and Afghanistan.<br>
           These areas at that time were also sparsely <br>
           populated.  Indian kingdoms/empires were largely<br>
           located East of the Indus, though at times they did<br>
           go further West into Pakistan/Afghanistan.  </p>
<p>           The mistake you are making is that you are clubbing<br>
           and mixing India&rsquo;s history with that of Pakistan and<br>
           Afghanistan&rsquo;s histories.  It is incorrect to do so.</p>
<p><br>
          Indians never mixed with their invaders as most of<br>
          them never reached India or if they did they were <br>
          booted out quite quickly.  </p>
<p>        <br>
          The Caste system has nothing to do with race.  The <br>
          Sanskrit literature doesn&rsquo;t mention Caste being <br>
          based on race.  So the assumption that caste is <br>
          based on race has no foundations at all.  There is<br>
          no evidence to show that caste was even hiearchical<br>
          to begin with or that it was based on physical color<br>
          as per the Hindu literature.  This is an important<br>
          point to consider.  </p>
<p><br>
          The gradations of color can be easily attributed to<br>
          genetic mutations over time (ie. internal genetic<br>
          differentiation) not necessarily due to any mixing.<br>
          Indians are an ancient race, some 60 000 years old<br>
          living continously in India.     </p>

		<p>To Zorba:  well big guy I am Korean guy working on his undergraduate, and I do not mean to argue with you or anyone else on American Renaissance. I never do.  I do not come here to argue with anyone.  I come here because I love reading what I can never read anywhere else and the comments by other AmRen members.</p>
<p>But if I may comment on your post&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;..Just go to YouTube and look up clips with &ldquo;James Shigeta&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s a Japanese-American actor) and count how many white girls he woos and kisses in the films he&rsquo;s made (not to mention how many white guys he kills) - all in films and shows that <b>date back to the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960s.</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>That is roughly 50~60 years ago, and probably more than three decades before I was born, (the Japanese dude was born in 1933) and I am not sure if you or anyone can use it as a valid evidence or proof to support your arguments.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use an example.  Tell me if it sounds reasonable to you.  There were a couple of car accidents in the state of Arkansas (just an example) 50~60 years ago.  Therefore, the whole state of Arkansas is automatically very prone to car accidents 50~60 years later to this day.  </p>
<p>Does not sound all that reasonable to me.  I would prefer proofs and evidences that would be just a little bit more recent. </p>
<p>&#8220;But here are some facts: for some reason, according to a study I read just the other week in the NY Times, Asian women are so willing to date white men, that a white man can earn $24,000 less in annual salary than an Asian male and still be preferred by an Asian female (in all other cases, it told more in earnings for a male outside of a female&rsquo;s race to appeal to her). Asian women, in other words, seem to be &ldquo;easy pickings&rdquo; for white men.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have more than a few years of working and designing this and that sometimes for myself and sometimes for others with computers, and I was asked more than a few times in the past to find things on the Internet for others they were having difficulty finding.  </p>
<p>and I failed to find the particular article you mentioned.  Could you give me the link to the webpage?  You told me you read it very recently.  is it because the article was so recent that the article has not been posted online yet?  </p>
<p>And the &#8220;fact&#8221; you mentioned, that is not how human attraction works.  &#8220;There is a woman, and man A makes 24000 more than man B therefore the woman will automatically choose man A.&#8221; That is not how human attraction works!! </p>
<p>There are many factors for a woman or a man to consider when she chooses a man or a woman.  There are some men who have no trouble winning women&rsquo;s hearts without generating any particulary high income, and there are other men who generate just as much or even more income but not having much success.  How would you explain that?  If the &#8220;fact&#8221; you specified is valid and correct, then a man who makes a specific amount of income must have the exactly same chance of winning a woman&rsquo;s heart as all other men who make the same amount of income.  </p>

Posted by Terrance at 6:22 PM on April 20</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing your definition of the word &#8216;racist&rsquo; is something along the lines of the traditional &#8216;old school&rsquo; <br>
1. &#8220;a racist is only a white supremist who believes that they are superior to all other racial groups based on their perceived unquie white qualities&#8221;. Which was was probably written for Whites by Whites.</p>
<p>How about accepting the definition I prefer of <br>
2. &#8220;a racist is someone who believes in racial differences and that each race has it&rsquo;s own distinct (mixed bag of) strengths and weakness&rsquo;s, <br>
with no one group virtue&rsquo;s completely dominating the others&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is really closer to a definition of a &#8216;Race Realist&rsquo;.<br>
Are you a Race Realist Terrance? <br>
Or do you think that the higher and lower expressions of each racial group are pretty much the same? <br>
Perhaps we were similar 50,000 years ago, but a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then.<br>
And you can not assume that all groups would have the exact same outcomes given the same opportunities now, surely.<br>
And if my second definition of a racist is what you were meaning then yes I am a &#8216;Racist&rsquo;, but that being a dirty and misunderstood word, <br>
you&rsquo;ll understand why I prefer &#8216;Race Realist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And we here who support the idea of homogenous coupling are bias towards our own, guilty as charged.<br>
We like who we are and who we come from and on these threads most posters probably are white.<br>
But we don&rsquo;t have monopoly on self pride.<br>
I&rsquo;m curious to where your bias comes from? </p>
<p>Heck, let&rsquo;s say diversity is great and diversity is wonderful! <br>
Why is it we can&rsquo;t as a group protect our basic Human Right to exist? <br>
And ensure our unquieness survives in this world,  this is what diversity is after all. <br>
Different groups comming together. <br>
Not just one big mixture of grey (or in this case brown).<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that this &ldquo;dork&rdquo; can&rsquo;t agree with you. I agree with Mr.Gaurav Ahuja that the caste system was originally based on race. It is disingenuous to claim that Indians are not very color conscious. Most Bollywood actresses and actors are European looking with light complexions. You can even see the gradations of color from North to South Indian with the Punjabi look being the ideal Indian type. I&rsquo;ve seen some Punjabi women that resemble Sophia Loren &mdash; every beautiful women indeed. </p>

<p><br>
Posted by Sardonicus at 12:50 PM on April 21 </p>
<p><br>
           Sardonicus, </p>
<p>           Let me remind you that Mr.Ahuja is not an authority<br>
           in this matter, hence you trying to take refuge in<br>
           him is not a valid argument just because he is India </p>
<p>           Your assumptions about caste being based on race is<br>
           just that, assumptions without any basis in actual<br>
           fact.  </p>
<p>           To understand the Caste System, we need to study the<br>
           sources of this system and that would obviously be<br>
           the Hindu literature from which the system arose.  </p>
<p>           Nowhere in the literature is caste defined or <br>
           organized on the principle of skin color or even<br>
           &#8220;race&#8221;.  This is something you can glean from the<br>
            Hindu Sanskrit texts if you actually studied them.</p>
<p>           I will quote a passage from the Bhagavad Gita that<br>
           clearly defines what is Caste exactly:</p>
<p>           Sanskrit Passage:  &#8220;Chaturvarnyam Maya Shrishtam<br>
           (Gita)                    Guna Karma Vibhaagasah&#8221;  <br>
         <br>
           Hindu God Krishna speaking to the Hero Arjuna.</p>
<p>           Meaning of the passage: The four-fold system <br>
                                   was created by me and<br>
                                   differentiated on the<br>
           basis of quality/character(Guna)and action/<br>
           occupation (Karma).    </p>
<p>           Now let me ask you an important question <br>
           Sardonicus, where do you see the word &#8220;race&#8221; <br>
           or skin color being mentioned in the passage <br>
           as the raison d&rsquo;etre of the caste <br>
           differentiation of the Caste system.   This <br>
           one passage neatly sums up what I have said <br>
           about the system.  It proves my point.  </p>
<p><br>
           As for gradations of skin tone among Indians,<br>
           the fact is overwhelming majority of Indians<br>
           are dark skinned (99%).  The reason for some <br>
           of the gradations is due to a combination of <br>
           climate, type of work(eg. agriculture)and <br>
           genetic mutations overtime(ie.60 000 years)<br>
           which lead to variations in skin tone.  <br>
           It is not due to any mixing.    </p>
<p>         <br>
           If I use your logic, Sardonicus, I can make the<br>
           assumption that Europeans are mixed breeds because<br>
           they don&rsquo;t have any standard hair color, eye-color,<br>
           ect.  Even in skin tone and general appearance, <br>
           there is a gradation in color from Northern Europe<br>
           to Southern Europe. Should it be inferred that <br>
           Europeans mixed with many races to come to look like<br>
           this?  No, the answer here would be autochthonous<br>
           internal genetic differentiation spread over a <br>
           period of time.  It is the same with Indians. <br>
           Indians are much more older in age than Europeans. </p>
<p><br>
           As for Bollywood Actresses, the truth is most of <br>
           them are not at all &#8220;European Looking with light<br>
           skin&#8221; if you see them offstage without all that<br>
           cosmetics, tons of make-up, and camera effects.  <br>
           I have seen many of these actresses behind the <br>
           camera. They are not what you think they are.  <br>
           In reality, they look typically Indian.  <br>
           Can&rsquo;t mistake them for anything else.       </p>
<p><br>
           Punjabis mostly come from Pakistan not so much<br>
           India.  Most of the Punjabis in India are refugees<br>
           from Pakistan 60 years ago.  So yeah, these people<br>
           might look a little different from mainstream <br>
           Indians.     </p>
<p> <br>
           Lastly, Indians are no more color conscious than <br>
           any other races/nationalities of the world.  You<br>
           want to see color conscious people, look for the <br>

		<p>Indians are distant cousins to whites, my friend, as well as other ethnicities that were prevalent in their geographical area throughout history. Early inhabitants of what is now India were white Caucasians. </p>
<p>Posted by whiteraven at 1:36 PM on April 21 </p>
<p><br>
                 White Raven, </p>
<p>                 Can you separate fact from fiction my friend?<br>
                 Indians are not the &#8220;distant cousins&#8221; of<br>
                 Whites.  Indians evolved in their own country<br>
                 racially over ten thousands of years<br>
                 independently without any external input.   </p>
<p>                 The &#8220;other ethnicities&#8221; that you talk about<br>
                 never  existed in present day India.  <br>
                 You are confusing India with Pakistan and<br>
                 Afghanistan.  Even though they are <br>
                 geographically close to India, they are not <br>
                 India!  </p>
<p>                 Here is an example, just because Spain and<br>
                 portugal were conquered by Arabs for 800<br>
                 years, shall we say that Germans and French<br>
                 were also conquered by Arabs??  I think you <br>
                 get the point.   </p>
<p>                 White Caucasians were never the original <br>
                 inhabitants of India.  How could they be??<br>
                 What a ludicrous statement.  <br>
                 If your talking about the Aryans, sorry pal<br>
                 but according to literary sources like the<br>
                 Rig-Veda ect, the Aryans were dark skinned<br>
                 native Indians who were indigenous to the <br>
                 northern part of India.  Not outsiders and<br>
                 not White.   </p>
<p>                 If you are wondering about linguistic <br>
                 affiliations, the reason for that is because<br>
                 the historical &#8220;Indo-Europeans&#8221; were originally<br>
                 from India and India is the actual homeland<br>
                 of IE dialects/speech.  Some tribes from India<br>
                 known as the Druhyus spread North-Westwards <br>
                 and gave you your language/dialect depending<br>
                 on how far they went.  So yes, you are <br>
                 connected to us linguistically but not <br>
                 racially!</p>

		<p>I was floored&hellip; FLOORED I TELL YOU&hellip; the other day when I saw a TV commercial for the matchmaking service eHarmony that featured (GASP) a WHITE MAN and a BLACK WOMAN!!!  Not because I was shocked or anything but because it is so rare&hellip; you NEVER see white man/black woman couples in the media.  EVER!</p>
<p>In the media, especially advertising, interracial couples are portrayed 99.999% of the time as black man/white woman.  I think we all know that this is no accident and I think we all know the reason behind it.  </p>
<p>Advertising is made to appeal to our basest desires.  And there aren&rsquo;t many things more base than a white woman who seeks a black man.  In my experience, white women who date black men are a particularly nasty breed, usually dealing with father issues.</p>
<p>Even a &#8220;black insurgent&#8221; must see the irony&hellip; wonder how the sistahs feel about all this?</p>
<p>Behind every white woman seeking a black man is someone deeply ashamed of themselves and their race, most likely someone who has been BRAINWASHED and taught from a very young age to hate themselves, hate their culture, hate their country, and hate the world that their culture has created.  In a way, they are victims.  The enemy is not white women&hellip; it is the race-haters infecting our schools and governments (they can&rsquo;t exist without leeching off of the taxpayers) that take great joy in seeing the white race humiliated, castrated, and ultimately destroyed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I like this&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys don&rsquo;t deserve much sympathy. You complain about race mixing and black men&rsquo;s desire for white women, but conveniently forget that the largest interracial coupling in the USA is WM/AF. How do you think Asian guys feel about that? The population of East Asian males in America is small, and they are also heavily stereotyped against. They get no help from the media, in fact, it&rsquo;s clearly against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope this isn&rsquo;t an attempt to explain all the Asian immigrant mass-murders in the USA lately&hellip; though it would explain a lot.</p>

		<p>Zorba is talking out of his hat.  The WM/AF pairing is the most common interracial relationship on a per capita basis.  Asian genes are dominant and the genetic displacement is just as severe as any BM/WF relationship.  You don&rsquo;t have to read Steve Sailer or GNXP to know that.  What the media chooses to promote has no bearing on the extent of real damage taking place.  Anecdotal asides about some guy on Youtube don&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

		<p>Just the other day, i was in a doctors office, my father&rsquo;s, when i noticed on the desk of one of the sectretary&rsquo;s, who was white, two photos of a black boy and black little girl. Out of curiosity, i asked the older woman secretary if the two children were the children of that secretary. (The younger woman had stepped out.) She said they were. I found out later from my father, that the older secretary was the mother of the younger one with the black children. This had been my first time there at that office and the mother, who had known my father for quite some time, seemed like a nice and down to earth person. But you could see on her face that she was heartbroken from her daughters&rsquo;s involvement with a black man and the black kids that were produced as a result.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the car on the way back from the doctor&rsquo;s, me and my dad got into a discussion over this matter, and he remarked to me that an old jewish doctor once told him that white women patients he treated, who were with black men, would break out in rashes and hives on there bodies from kissing and other intimate acts. Ironically, i knew a woman who worked at a local hair salon, who would sometimes cut my hair and who had a live in black boyfriend, would have this rash on her neck and upper chest area. She would tell people there, customers and co-workers, that the rash developed from the hair she cut from her various clients. Now i know different. </p>

		<p>Pragmatic Race Man, those boys were, I hope, probably just talking, basking in the glow of their own media-inspired &#8220;righteousness&#8221;, actually hoping that someone would hear their noble oratory (&#8220;What a fine, open-minded, progressive fellow I am, appreciating the delectable attributes of Michelle.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Pragmatic&#8221; is the word. Most people do not have the experience, they only have the theories that education imposes on them, so they simply cannot be intelligently pragmatic. In my experience, reality always blows the rickety framework of theory to bits, and the theory must be re-evaluated on an individual basis. ANY theory, whether it be color theory, economic theory, or psychological theory. Most who miscegenate,will, I feel, find this out, but perhaps they will serve as exemplars to a lost generation, and as an advisory against the paucity of theory?</p>
<p>I was very gratified by my trip to Europe  &mdash;  it was like a cleansing summer shower to see such an OVERWHELMING number of Whites! And they were all trim, NONE, NOT A ONE was fat! Quite a bit of smoking, though. But it was like America, in the late fifties  &mdash;  I felt at home. Even the few Blacks  I did see spoke perfect German or French, and were European in spirit.</p>
<p>A few will always make the grade. Just a few. </p>
<p>But it is America who will fall, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Europe will hold strong, once the Muslim thing is dealt with.</p>
<p>(My wife tried to politely hold the door for a French gentleman. He instead held the door for her, gently saying, I think, &#8220;Elle c&rsquo;est, Mademoiselle&#8221; which I took to mean, &#8220;You are the woman, Miss.&#8221; At any rate, that was the effect. Noticing the differences in the sexes  &mdash;  a good start to recovery, but it seems to be forbidden in America.)</p>

		<p><i>It&rsquo;s only offensive to white racists, thankfully, a dying breed.<br>
Posted by Black Insurgent at 7:07 PM on April 20</i></p>
<p>Trying to put some salt into the percieved wound hey.<br>
Us White &#8216;Racists&rsquo; are a dying breed? Yeah having a Black President is doing our numbers no good at all.<br>
The White race isn&rsquo;t even replacing itself.<br>
Ironically it&rsquo;s us White Racists (using my second definition above),<br>
who&rsquo;ll be the genetic survivors and guardians of our group in the long run.  <br>
Do you think the World will be able to sustain your ancestorial tribe and the rest of the third world&rsquo;s penchant for over breeding? <br>
Please look at the Mathematics of consistent growth, be it related to the Human population, consuming our finite natural resources or in constant economic growth. Global population growth even at it&rsquo;s current rate of 1.2% is unsustainable and within the next twenty years something is got to give seriousily! <br>
So be carefull what you wish for Mr Insurgent.<br>
Please watch this series: <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/9dsehv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/9dsehv</a> (Whiteplight you&rsquo;ll also enjoy). <br>
And &#8216;when the bow breaks&rsquo; I suspect it&rsquo;ll be a White person you&rsquo;ll be looking to stand next to.</p>
<p>In aiming for global equality, the pressure the rest of the World is putting on the West with over population and the demand for a increased standard of living, means we&rsquo;ll soon have to drop our living standards by several notchs. <br>
By denying eugenics, the World is being &#8216;socialised&rsquo; into a &#8216;One World Order&rsquo;. <br>
Global Welfare out of nesseccity to pay for those who know no self control or who weren&rsquo;t ready to receive Western technology. </p>
<p>We Whites haven&rsquo;t always collectively been the Obese, self indulgent, feminine, apologetic group who are &#8216;on the decline&rsquo;.<br>
And frankly we&rsquo;ve gotten too comfortable.<br>
We thrive in adversity!<br>
And we have always rebuilt when nature or War has destroyed all that we have.<br>
  <br>
Race Realists look at the World with open eyes, avoiding the disarming &#8216;colorblind&rsquo; ideal that the left pushes on us.<br>
Which just makes us vunerable to our Racist opponents.</p>
<p>As someone with odvious Black pride, don&rsquo;t you find it insulting yourself, that these White liberal&rsquo;s suggest that you should bred out your Blackness?<br>
In the following video a Black nationalist, lists Black celebrities who have at least dated White&rsquo;s.<br>
&#8216;Black Hollywood and interracial dating - bossip.com&rsquo;<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/c2rl2t" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/c2rl2t</a><br>
He lists virtually every Black celebrity I can think of. <br>
Dating or marrying Whites must be a sign of success to most Blacks, but it&rsquo;s still a sell out and a omission of inferiority.</p>
<p>If it is true that we are all equal, and that in education for instances it is discrimination that leads to slanted academic results. <br>
You wouldn&rsquo;t need white genes at all.<br>
I think there is a more sinster and insulting motivation to Blacks, in promoting B/W relationships by White liberals.<br>
It&rsquo;s cheaper than throwing money at schools who don&rsquo;t seem to be showing the results, that the Multi-culters so desperately desire to prove their theories.  </p>
<p>And this is where the &#8216;one drop rule&rsquo; puts WN at a disadvantage, I think historically it must have worked as a deterrent for miscegenation. <br>
But these days is working against White America.<br>
Mulatto&rsquo;s are being used to disprove our arguements, look at Pres Hussien for instances. Proof of nuture over nature.<br>
Or as a example, if Queen Latifah and Steven Hawkins (don&rsquo;t visualise) had a love child. Their prodigy progeny would be a example of a &#8216;Black&rsquo; intellectual.</p>
<p>Having that third category to explain Black/White hybrid achievement is necessary.<br>
Not only for our point if view but for the self esteem of the Mulatto offspring. <br>
Who frankly are the innocent victims and who must just see themselves as &#8216;Black&rsquo;.<br>
In South Africa under apartheid they organised their population with the categories of Black, White, Coloured and Indian.<br>
The majority Black ANC Government in South Africa <b>today</b>, <br>
does not officially recognise Coloured&rsquo;s as being equal with ethnic Blacks when satisfying A.A. requirements.<br>
Probably as a consequence of Coloured peoples receiving educations and rights better than those provided to Black South Africans, though under apartheid they were still inferior to those of Whites.<br>
A recent infamous ANC quote (that contributed to poor coloured voter turn out for their 2004 election) was  <br>
&#8220;not white enough under apartheid, and not black enough under the ANC&#8221;. <br>
A cycnical way to look at it is, when it&rsquo;s in their interest such as in the States, Mulatto&rsquo;s are Black. <br>
But when it comes time to divide the pie such as in S.A., Mulatto&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t Black. <br>
But then try creating another divisive racial category in these &#8216;post racial&rsquo; political days. <br>

<p>Nonsense, John: if nobody cares about white guys dating Asian gals, why do are there self-appointed high priests of white nationalism posting here threatening excommunication for white men who do so and doom for the movement from such behavior?  Why are there Asian guys like you here fuming about it?<p>The concocted controversy here about white guys and Asian gals is simply an &#8220;apple of discord&#8221; tossed in to throw the thread off-topic.  The white female/black male kissing visual has much more impact and should have more impact because of the racial history of this country, the crime statistics regarding black on white crime - especially black rapes of white women, and the ongoing efforts to displace white couples (still the majority in this hapless country) with mixed ones in portrayals in the popular culture.  It&rsquo;s also a good focus for raising white race consciousness, which is probably the reason why so many disruptors here are repeatedly offering their fulminations about the &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; of white guys and yellow gals.  <i>Bu dui ma?</i>

That same year, there were 286,000 white women married to black men, and 117,000 white men with black wives.  By contrast, there were 50,224,000 white women married to a husband of the same race in 2006.  Looking at these statistics, I&rsquo;d say one should raise the alarm about those &#8220;others,&#8221; unless of course that doesn&rsquo;t suit your agenda.<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like a credible reference for your <i>ex cathedra</i> claim (which you carefully covered by claiming I didn&rsquo;t need to check Steve Sailer or GNXP to confirm) that &#8220;Asian genes are dominant and the genetic displacement is just as severe as any BM/WF relationship.&#8221;  Are you making the claim that the genetic differences and distance between whites and East Asians are no different than those between whites and black Africans?

		<p>Rudy, thanks for the story about the rashes. I don&rsquo;t believe any old thing I hear on the internet, but I know that there are little racial tidbits like this that nobody who knows will mention except in a whisper. I am going to be on the lookout for this to see if I can find some verification.</p>
<p>I do know that whites keep themselves very separate from blacks, no matter how much noise they make about Obama or PC. I think it&rsquo;s instinct. It&rsquo;s not just their behavior, it&rsquo;s physical revulsion. </p>
<p>When I was a little kid, we had a dark black nanny. Every time she would touch or kiss my blond baby brother, I would run up and kiss him on the cheek. I was afraid he would turn black or something, like it was contagious! Kids do the darndest things, and I come from a household where nobody would ever say the &#8220;n-word&#8221; or anything like that. </p>

<p>Whew!  What a relief.  You don&rsquo;t know how good that makes me feel.</p>
<p>But the entire area, about 5000 BC was inundated with white Caucasians, as was all of the Mediterranean zone, including North Africa.  It was all part of the great white migration.  Indians came later, as they&rsquo;re doing now.  </p>
<p>We build the civilization; Indians show up to try to gain from our hard work and efforts.  Indians should be ashamed of themselves. </p>
<p>Incidentally, how did a country as small as Britain dominate a country as large as India for so many years?  Does it have anything to do with average group I.Q.: Britain 100; India 81?</p>

<p>Either you are for interracial dating or you are not. You cannot use the foolish, groundless, hypocritical argument that it is Asians are okay to date, yet I am against interracial dating. </p>
<p>The fact is that many of you are trying to have it both ways. If you beleive that it is acceptable for Whites and Asians to date, have sex and marry one another, but it is not okay for other non-Whites to then you need to say so, because this is what you are saying. </p>

White men in fact have been far less race conscious than Asian men - everywhere whites go they produce hybrids - the aborigines and Maoris of Australasis are mostly not full blood, the Cape coloreds, Amerinds (who are mostly not full blood), the whole continent of South America.</p>
<p>Visit any Asian country - especially Phillipines and Thailand and you see white men lusting after brown and yellow women - and they are not your average PC type liberal either.</p>
<p>From Pocahontas to Madam Butterfly, to Sayonara, to Thomas Jefferson, to Strom Thurmond with the servant girl, to the Karate Kid, white men have demonstrated themselves to be the greatest race mixers in all of human history.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with political correctness.</p>
<p>Admit it people- the outrage on display here has less to do with some notion of caring for the future of the white race, than simply maximizing the potential dating pool for white males.</p>

		<p>Oh - and another observation just to prove my point:</p>
<p>I have personally seen white men very uncomfortable when they see a black guy with an <i>Asian</i> woman! </p>
<p>This was also noticed by James Michener (I forgot the book). White soldiers stationed in Korea and Japan in the immediate post-war period did not like it when black solidiers dated Asian girls.</p>
<p>So for whites, this is just about retaining all the ladies (of whatever race) for themselves - it really has nothing to do with ideology - but everything to do with biology.</p>
<p>The author of this article has a very interesting take on it:<br>
<a href="https://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2001&amp;x=reaction" rel="nofollow">https://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2001&x;=reaction</a></p>
<p>The author notes that whites often show disapproval towards black men with yellow women. His explanation seems right on the money to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;the yellow woman is considered the white man&rsquo;s exclusive toy, and he is not willing to share this toy with other men of any color&#8221; </p>
<p>Obviously White nationlism has nothing to do with &#8216;fairness&rsquo; or &#8216;reciprococity&rsquo; as Jared Taylor would say. </p>
<p>It has everything to do with white power.</p>

Regular posters on AR have openly declared it. Judging by your comments I&rsquo;d wager that you&rsquo;re also one of those guys with (or wants) an Asian or otherwise non-white wife or girlfriend. And this talk of not being able to have relationships with them freaks you out. So now you&rsquo;re lashing out at both Asian males and WN on this forum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know why guys with Asian wives would still come to AR and think that they&rsquo;re white nationalists, so I&rsquo;m just going to chalk it up to insecurity on their part.</p>

		<p><i>The white female/black male kissing visual has much more impact and should have more impact because of the racial history of this country, the crime statistics regarding black on white crime - especially black rapes of white women, and the ongoing efforts to displace white couples (still the majority in this hapless country) with mixed ones in portrayals in the popular culture.</i></p>
<p>Zorba_the_Geek: you miss the point of White Nationalism entirely.<br>
While the reasons you have mentioned are good reasons for white women not to go with blacks, they are not the real reason.</p>
<p>The real reason why whites should not go with non-whites, has nothing to do with the virtue or lack thereof of non-whites.</p>
<p>It has <i>everything</i> and I mean <i>everything</i> to do with preserving our white genes.</p>
<p>I have met Asians whom I personally like and can well get along with. But I am against the miscgenation of white with yellow as much as white with black.</p>
<p>While the latter combination may be more problematic from an individual perspective in terms of marital discord, both combinations are as destructive as each other in destroying our white gene pool - &#8216;visual impact&rsquo; notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Remember we are only seven percent - yes seven percent of the world&rsquo;s population. We are simply vastly outnumbered by East Asiatics.</p>
<p>I find it astounding that a seemingly intelligent self-styled &#8216;geek&rsquo; such as yourself fails to see this. <br>

		<p>Jaya Deva,</p>
<p>What you just said doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. If we are only related in a linguistic sense, then did the invaders who came from India to Europe (as you claim), just turn around and go back home after giving us their language? And if the invaders came from India to Europe and not from Europe to India, then how come there aren&rsquo;t any dark skinned dravidian genes that exist in Europe today?  </p>
<p>Europeans have lighter, more recessive genes than most brown-skinned Indians. We can move down and immigrate to your country and then thousands of years later not leave much of a racial imprint.  However, when you come and immigrate to our lands, you will most definately leave a racial imprint that will last a while.</p>
<p>And how do you explain the fact the during certain periods of the distant past India had a &#8220;great&#8221; civilization but today it is a third world dump while Europe is thriving?  How do you explain that if white people didn&rsquo;t live in India at one time?</p>
<p>Now I would like to say something to all the Indians who post on here.  Why are you guys on here?  If you are so proud of your race then go post on an Indian website.  Most of the people on here don&rsquo;t think too highly of Indians at all.  Do you guys really think you are going to change our opinions? </p>
<p>In the West, the aryan invasion theory is largely accepted and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you are so certain that your side of the story is correct then what do you have to worry about, and why does it matter to you so much that we are getting your history wrong?  I don&rsquo;t see very many white people wasting their time posting on the hundreds of websites on which Indian posters are discussing how &#8220;the aryan invasion is a myth&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It sounds to me like you guys are the ones with the inferiority complex.  But then again I am not surprised at all.</p>

		<p>I do not wish to see any Whites mating outside our race, but I honestly do not feel the sort of revulsion when I see a Yellow/White mix as when I see a Black/White mix.  The differences between Whites and Yellows is so much less than between us and Blacks, that I do not get the sense of beastiality that I do when I see Black and White together.  A White with Yellow fever may have left our race, but they have not left civilization.<br>
     I understand and respect the views of Yellow men who object to White men taking up with Yellow women, but don&rsquo;t blame me, or the White race as a whole.  The Yellow women have equal responsibility, so clean up your own house.  I&rsquo;ll be happy if you&rsquo;re successful.</p>

<p>Nancy you are correct when you say this but I would add black men behave this way too.  This country has become &#8220;africanized&#8221; and I think there is something about that idea on this website.  Black men used to be known for being oversexed but now it&rsquo;s all american men that are oversexed.  I think religion was one of the tools that used to keep men faithful to their families.  I know of too many little kids who, because of their white father&rsquo;s failure to keep it zipped, are now living with mom and a stepfather and only get to visit their real father.  <br>

		<p>I also do not feel revulsion when I see White/Yellow, Schoolteacher. When I see Black/White  or Black/Yellow, I do.</p>
<p>I know I have said this before, but my DNA test reveals a small admixture of East Asian genetics, which has puzzled me and shocked my brother (&#8220;[sputter, sputter], It can&rsquo;t be!&#8221;). On my recent trip to Europe, I saw the most dark- or black-headed (like me) people in Germany. (The most light-headed and blue-eyed were in England, by far). I feel that these Germans, too, probably have a small admixture of East Asian DNA.</p>
<p>I was always perplexed about my DNA test, but I think German history provides the answer. Attila the Hun attacked the Ostrogoths, drove them out, and later allied with the  Visigoths to attack Rome before he was defeated by the Roman general, Aelius, near present-day Paris. </p>
<p>Attila hovered around northern Italy for a while, married a German princess, and retreated to Hungary, where many people carry the name of &#8220;Attila&#8221; with pride (from European History for Dummies, by Sean Lang, 2006, pp. 72-73).</p>
<p>So I think my small Asian admixture came through the Housers and Pfeiffers in my bloodline, but even if I had none, I think I would still feel the same way about &#8220;Black-and ______&#8221; couples. </p>

		<p>&#8220;As for gradations of skin tone among Indians,<br>
the fact is overwhelming majority of Indians<br>
are dark skinned (99%). The reason for some <br>
of the gradations is due to a combination of <br>
climate, type of work(eg. agriculture)and <br>
genetic mutations overtime(ie.60 000 years)<br>
which lead to variations in skin tone. <br>
It is not due to any mixing.&#8221; RN</p>
<p>  I would say that races are due to genetic mutations and mixing has occured over thousands of years. Mr. RN, if as you say the caste system has never had anything to do with race wouldn&rsquo;t you expect to see as many light as dark skinned people in the Dalit or untouchables? Why do they seem to be overwhelmingly dark skinned? </p>
<p>It is also interesting and amusing that you think that Punjabi&rsquo;s are not Indian but are Pakistani. My Punjabi friends would be surprised by that. So your admitting that Indians and Pakistani&rsquo;s are two different races?  Punjabi&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t Indian?</p>
<p>in addition, I have studied Hindu literature and read both the Mahābhārata&rsquo; and the Rāmāyaṇa and if I had the time or inclination I could extract a passage on &#8220;race mixing&#8221; from the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>As far as Bollywood actor and actresses, being light skinned and European looking, I&rsquo;ve included some images so that our AR readers can decide for themselves if it is really <br>
&#8220;cosmetics, tons of make-up, and camera effects that make them look that way&#8221;: <a href="https://www.centralchronicle.com/uploads/23amisha.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.centralchronicle.com/uploads/23amisha.jpg</a><br>

&#8220;Lastly, Indians are no more color conscious than <br>
any other races/nationalities of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Atila the Hun was West/Central Asian. Gengis Khan and the other Mongols are Central Asians. And their genetic contributions are deemed to be very small, especially west of Berlin. </p>

I think you really are missing a basic point here; the white people who are currently dating, or worse procreating, outside of the white race, are basically lost causes. This holds true for both white men and women. Or put another way, you cannot be part of the solution of white preservation, if you are contributing to (or potentially doing so) the genocide of the white race via miscegenation. That is a point of logic, that is not really open for argument.</p>
<p>While you are correct, that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what I personally think of such arrangements, or that such opinions as expressed by myself on the topic may turn off such people to the cause of White Nationalism/Preservation, they have already indicated their true allegiances, by way of reproductive/genetic realities. In effect, they have already converted to the most basic principles of multiculturalism&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>                White Raven, </p>

                Stormfront??  If you were to write a term<br>
                paper for your history class, are you honestly<br>
                going to cite &#8220;Stormfront&#8221; in your bibliography?<br>
                I think you know the answer to that.  </p>
<p><br>
                In 5000 BC, which would be around 7000 years<br>
                ago, the ancestors of modern White Europeans<br>
                were living in the Central Asian-Caucasus<br>
                region.  This is confirmed in the Indian <br>
                literature known as Brahmanas like Aitareya<br>
                Brahmana as well as the Puranas.  Also the <br>
                Tocharian mummies prove that Europeans were<br>
                living in Central Asia at one point of time.  </p>
<p>               <br>
                However, that does not mean that White <br>
                Europeans were living everywhere in the area<br>
                like India, Iran, Greater Middle-East or<br>
                even North Africa.   That claim is simply<br>
                illogical.  Also there is no objective <br>
                evidence showing that Whites ever inhabited<br>
                the above mentioned countries/geographical<br>
                areas.  They were present at one time in <br>
                the Central Asian-Caucasus regions.   </p>
<p><br>
                From the Central Asian-Caucasus regions, the <br>
                &#8220;Great White Migration&#8221; took place in a North-<br>
                 Westerly&#8221; direction towards Europe through<br>
                 the Volga into Eastern Europe and finally<br>
                 throughout the rest of Europe.  This is also<br>
                known as the &#8220;Kurgan&#8221; expansions into Europe.<br>
                There is also archaeological evidence for <br>
                these expansions towards Europe but <br>
                interestingly no evidence showing a movement <br>
                towards India, Iran or the rest of Middle East<br>
                and North Africa.   </p>
<p><br>
                According to Indian Sanskrit literature, the <br>
                people inhabiting Central Asia were known as<br>
                barbarians (ie.Sanskrit Mlecchas).  Since<br>
                at that time, Central Asia was not inhabited<br>
                by Turks or Mongols or even by Iranians or<br>
                even Indians, the only possibility of who <br>
                inhabited Central Asia could only be White <br>
                Europeans at that distant time.    </p>
<p><br>
                But there is a catch here though.  According<br>
                to the Rig-Veda, an INDIAN tribe by the name<br>
                of Druhyus were defeated by other Indian tribes<br>
                like the Purus, Anus, Yadus, Ikshvakus and<br>
                expelled from India.  The Druhyus migrated out<br>
                of India into Central Asia and became kings <br>
                of some of the European peoples there.  This<br>
                is confirmed in the Aitareya Brahmana as well<br>
                the Puranas.  The Indian Druhyu kings ruled<br>
                over the barbaric European peoples in Central <br>
                Asia and by a process known as &#8220;Elite Dominance&#8221;<br>
                made the Europeans switch over to Indo-European<br>
                dialects.    </p>
<p><br>
                The proof that Europeans were never originally<br>
                Indo-European speakers is proven by the very<br>
                existence of the Basque and Finnish languages<br>
                which are non-Indo-European.  Genetic studies<br>
                show that racially, Basques and Western <br>
                Europeans are the same people, YET one of them<br>
                speaks non-Indo-European and the others Indo-<br>
                European languages.  It is the same with the <br>
                Finns.  Basque is a much older language than <br>
                its surrounding IE languages.   </p>
<p>                The reason for this dichotomy is that non-<br>
                Indo-European speakers like Basque and Finnish<br>
                migrated towards Europe before the newly <br>
                converted IE speaking Europeans did.  The <br>
                Europeans who remained behind in Central Asia<br>
                after the Basque and Finnish speakers left <br>
                were Indo-Europeanized in language by the<br>
                process of &#8220;Elite Dominance&#8221; by the incoming<br>
                Indian Druhyu tribe from India.   </p>
<p>                That is the basic reason why there is a <br>
                linguistic connection between Indians and <br>
                Europeans but not a racial connection.     </p>
<p><br>
                Indians can justifiably be proud of their<br>
                ancient Vedic civilization and Sanskrit language<br>
                which they developed and nurtured by themselves <br>
                for millenias.  Why should they have to be<br>
                ashamed??? Whites never developed this culture<br>
  </p>
<p><br>
                Indians have been living for 60 000 years in <br>
                India, they never came later on and settled<br>
                after Whites!!  This is a ridiculous proposition<br>
                and no serious historian entertains this belief<br>
                You need to do some real reading and not some<br>
                propaganda surfing!  </p>
<p><br>
                As for the British colonial period, the only<br>
                reason it happened is that we had traitors and<br>
                collaborators among our own kind at that time.<br>
                It was due to the underhanded dealings between<br>
                our kings and the British that made it happen.<br>
                Also keep one thing in mind, it was the support<br>
                and loyalty of the Indian forces that kept the<br>
                Empire going in India and in other parts of <br>
                Asia.  But what happened once the colonial<br>
                Indian forces refused to support the Empire?<br>
                The British Empire quickly dissolved within<br>
                20 years and its imperial flag was tossed into<br>
                the bin without a murmur!   </p>
<p>                IQ has nothing to do with it.  </p>
<p>                By the way, White Iranians have an IQ of 84 <br>
                compared to White Europeans of 100.  If IQ and<br>
                racial affinity are correlated, then your theory<br>
                that Whites Iran and the Middle-East is false <br>
                because the IQ show that we are talking about <br>
                different races here even though they are <br>
                IE speaking!  This proves my point. <br>
    <br>
                 </p>

<p> I would say that races are due to genetic mutations and mixing has occured over thousands of years. Mr. RN, if as you say the caste system has never had anything to do with race wouldn&rsquo;t you expect to see as many light as dark skinned people in the Dalit or untouchables? Why do they seem to be overwhelmingly dark skinned? </p>
<p>Posted by Sardonicus at 1:48 PM on April 23   </p>
<p></p>
<p>                <br>
                      Sardonicus, </p>
<p>                      There are light skinned &#8220;Dalits&#8221; also.  <br>
                      Not just dark-skinned ones.  But one thing<br>
                      that needs to be mentioned is that Dalits<br>
                      are actually people who were once members<br>
                      of the four castes-Brahmin, Ksatriya, <br>
                      Vaishya and Shudra.  Dalits were basically<br>
                      people who were once a part of the Caste <br>
                      system, who belonged to one of the above<br>
                      four castes and were living normally in <br>
                      the society at one point of time.  </p>
<p>                <br>
                      Dalits are basically the outcastes of all<br>
                      the four castes.  Some Dalits were once<br>
                      Brahmins actually, some were members of<br>
                      royalty, that is Ksatriyas, some are <br>
                      actually Vaishyas and Shudras.  </p>
<p>                      The reason the majority of Dalits are dark<br>
                      is simply because the overwhelmingly<br>
                      majority of Indians are dark-skinned, so <br>
                      obviously it makes sense if Dalits are <br>
                      for the most part dark-skinned.  Nothing<br>
                      surprising about that.  </p>
<p>                      You are also making the mistake thinking<br>
                      that all &#8220;upper castes&#8221; are light skinned.<br>
                      No this is not the case at all.  There <br>
                      are many, many upper-caste Indians who <br>
                      are dark as well.     </p>
<p>                      The reason some people became Dalits <br>
                      is because they didn&rsquo;t perform their <br>
                      duties and responsibilities to the <br>
                      society.  So they were excommunicated<br>
                      from the social order.    </p>
<p>                      The Indian literature talks about<br>
                      &#8220;fallen Brahmins&#8221;, &#8220;fallen Ksatriyas&#8221;,<br>
                       &#8220;fallen Vaishyas&#8221;, &#8220;fallen Shudras&#8221;.  <br>
                       The &#8220;fallen&#8221; people of these castes <br>
                       became the &#8220;Dalits&#8221; or literally put<br>
                      &#8220;outcastes&#8221;.  Again race and color has<br>
                      nothing to do with it because most of <br>
                      these Dalits were once &#8220;Upper Castes&#8221; <br>
                      themselves who simply got excommunicated<br>
                      for direliction of duties and <br>
                      responsibilities to the society.  <br>

		<p><i>put another way, you cannot be part of the solution of white preservation, if you are contributing to (or potentially doing so) the genocide of the white race via miscegenation. That is a point of logic, that is not really open for argument.</i><br>  &mdash;  -Posted by John PM at 6:27 PM on April 23 </p>
<p>Why, sure, John - that&rsquo;s as &#8220;logical&#8221; as a chopped salad!  A &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; movement that won&rsquo;t accept other whites who&rsquo;ve dated or mated with non-whites -indeed, that will &#8220;ostracize&#8221; them as heretics- is as &#8220;logical&#8221; as Christians not evangelizing sinners.<p>So, let me understand your logic even better, John: there&rsquo;s a distinguished British contributor to American Renaissance named John Derbyshire who&rsquo;s married to a Chinese lady and has two children by her. Due solely to that fact, &#8220;logic&#8221; which is &#8220;not really open for argument&#8221; requires that he be &#8220;ostracized&#8221; and &#8220;kicked out from our ranks,&#8221; isn&rsquo;t that correct?<p>Or how about Mr. Jared Taylor, whose present personal life I have no details of, and which heretofore I considered none of my business,- may I not now, following your &#8220;logic,&#8221; make the impudent imputation, based on nothing but the fact that he was raised in Japan, speaks fluent Japanese, visits Japan from time to time, and has Japanese friends, that Mr. Jared Taylor dates Japanese ladies?<p>I&rsquo;m being somewhat facetious in order to make a serious point: white nationalism is indeed about saving the white race, but its adherents must never forget that the white race is not some &#8220;social constructed&#8221; monad but is made up of white <i>individuals,</i> who as white people typically do, crave their own individuality, choices and freedom.  Whether or not they are dating non-whites, white people will not be bullied or hectored into supporting the preservation of the white race by arrogant prescriptions about their personal lives.  Idiotic &#8220;presumptions&#8221; that a man or woman is &#8220;lost&#8221; to the white race or white nationalism simply because he or she has mated or dated a non-white makes WN not into a coherent movement with any chance of viability (and consequent <i>real</i> opportunity to preserve the white race), but a ridiculous druidical conclave to be despised and shunned by most other whites, even as its tiny retinue of martinets purports to despise and &#8220;ostracize&#8221; other non-conforming whites.  <p>One more point that is &#8220;not really open to argument,&#8221; John: No matter what you or any other would-be Torquemada might say, I believe in and support the preservation of the white race, and I have sense enough to see how it truly may be saved, as well as how close-minded prigs could send it to its doom.

<p>Interesting observations there Zorba; not quite chopped salad in terms of logic to be sure, but something more akin to tossing a jar of mayonnaise on a whole cabbage, and then declaring it coleslaw!</p>
<p>If you bother to reread what I wrote above, you should be able to comprehend that my point was that if anyone is engaged in miscegenation or potential miscegenation, they are part of the problem and not the solution. By definition, White Nationalism implies that one has decided that the white race is their nation, period. Much like a country or any other political entity, you cannot be loyal to outside predators or enemies. For example, I cannot state that I am &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; to the USA, while selling its military technologies to China or Russia; nor could I state that I am a committed capitalist, while openly funding or enthusiastically joining the Communist Party. It is simply not possible!</p>
<p>Indeed, whites who select to be sympathetic to White Nationalism while also mongrelizing their offspring, are free to believe whatever they like if it makes them feel good abstractly. However, they are contributing to their own race&rsquo;s multicultural genocide in tangible practice, and nothing is going to change that fact!</p>

		<p>John PM: you have hit the nail right on the head.</p>
<p>As for John Derbyshire, he has been quite explicit. He is NOT a white nationalist - &#8220;it would get me in trouble at home&#8221; - he said during a debate a few years ago with Jared.</p>
<p>John Derbyshire is simply a race realist - like Steve Sailer he recognizes racial differences in ability, and believes these to be mainly genetic.</p>
<p>But he is not a white preservationist. His views, I believe, are more or less follow Sailer&rsquo;s &#8216;citizenist&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>&#8216;Citizenism&rsquo; is the polar opposite of White Nationalism.</p>
<p>Sailer is quite insouciant about interracial marriage - he does not believe whites are endangered and has simply advised &#8220;marry who you love&#8221; https://www.vdare.com/Sailer/marriage.htm<br>

		<p>It is also interesting and amusing that you think that Punjabi&rsquo;s are not Indian but are Pakistani. My Punjabi friends would be surprised by that. So your admitting that Indians and Pakistani&rsquo;s are two different races? Punjabi&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t Indian?</p>
<p>in addition, I have studied Hindu literature and read both the Mahābhārata&rsquo; and the Rāmāyaṇa and if I had the time or inclination I could extract a passage on &ldquo;race mixing&rdquo; from the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>Posted by Sardonicus at 1:48 PM on April 23   </p>
<p></p>
<p>                  Sardonicus, </p>
<p>                  Punjabis are basically from the Punjab which<br>
                  is situated in Pakistan.  Only a small part <br>
                  of it is in India.  Punjab is a big province<br>
                  that basically stretches from the Afghan <br>
                  border to the Indian border, basically <br>
                  consisting of most of Pakistan.  </p>
<p><br>
                  Pakistanis belong to the same category as <br>
                  Afghans and are in fact for the most part<br>
                  a different race than Indians.  Only some<br>
                  Pakistanis have Indian ancestry, namely <br>
                  those who fled to Pakistan 60 years ago.  </p>
<p><br>
                  As for your comment on having read the <br>
                  Mahabharata and the passage on &#8220;race mixing&#8221;,<br>
                  no offence intended, but I believe you are <br>
                  bluffing here. </p>
<p><br>
                  I will paraphrase from the Mahabharata to <br>
                  show that what you say is false.  </p>
<p><br>
                  Mahabharata: Shanti Parva: 188/11-15    </p>
<p>                  &#8220;The Division is not based upon any <br>
                   physical differences between the <br>
                   individuals.  They have the same kind of <br>
                   body and blood&#8221;.   </p>
<p>                   &#8220;When Brahma created mankind, everyone was<br>
                   made a Brahmin.  Everyone was virtous.&#8221;  </p>
<p>                   &#8220;With time and degeneration of the mind and<br>
                   activities, people moved into other <br>
                   castes&#8221;.  </p>
<p>                   &#8220;A Brahmin who is princely, passionate, <br>
                    courageous and intelligent but has a <br>
                    sharp temperament that gives into emotions<br>
                    like anger is a Kshatriya&#8221;.  </p>
<p>                   &#8221; A Brahmin who protects the cow but earns<br>
                     a livelihood from agriculture or business<br>
                     is a Vaishya&#8221;.  </p>
<p>                   &#8220;Those who love violence, falsehood, are <br>
                    greedy and selfish and live by doing menial<br>
                    jobs are called Shudras&#8221;.  </p>
<p><br>

<p>                  Sardonicus, </p>
<p>                  Light skinned people exist throughout Asia.  <br>
                  Simply having the light skin doesn&rsquo;t mean<br>
                  that these people are Europeans or have <br>
                  anything to do with White people.  </p>
<p>                  You can find many light skinned Arabs or <br>
                  Persians who could pass for European but <br>
                  these people are not in any way connected<br>
                  to Europeans at all racially speaking. </p>
<p>                  Those pictures are taken by Camera!! </p>
<p>                  You need to see these actresses offstage <br>
                  up front.  Then you&rsquo;ll see that they are<br>
                  not all that you thought they were.  Even<br>
                  Aishwarya Rai isn&rsquo;t so light skinned as she<br>
                  is made out to be.  I was actually surprised<br>
                  when I saw her without any make-up or other<br>
                  embellishments on.  She is much darker in <br>
                  reality than what she appears in photographs<br>
                  or on camera.    </p>

<p>I like your lively and witty writings, and, as I scan the comments, if I see the John PM logo, I usually read your response first.</p>
<p>John, one time, AS AN EXPERIEMENT, I wrote an e-mail to an extreme WN group, an told them I had a SMALL ADMIXTURE (estimated 4%, not more than 10%) of Oriental genetics, as revealed by my DNA test, but I would like to join.  They did not want me to be in their group (I did admire their adherence to their own standards!) as they only took 100% purebloods, not mongrels of any type! The leader, at that time, wrote me back an email that said, &#8220;How could you be East Indian (sic)?&#8221; Bad night at the whiskey, perhaps?</p>
<p>I feel this group, who did not want an alliance with me, is ignorant of European history (see my post above), and that many of their members have probably not even had a DNA test! </p>
<p>You seem to favor German things, John. Have you ever been there, and looked at the people? They are far from the supposed &#8220;Nordic&#8221; ideal of blonde hair and blue eyes, as are the French and everyone else I saw in Europe. The Brits or Swiss came the closest, from what I saw, and blue eyes and lighter hair seems to be the norm in the area I saw of England (the Brighton area, Sussex University in Falmer).</p>
<p>Europeans are the most desirable, creative, and inquiring people on earth, and small  miscegenations, whether forced or voluntary,  will be re-absorbed by the Euro gene pool, leaving a bit of &#8220;spice&#8221; in certain individuals.</p>

<p>Many Germans east of the Elbe are of Slavic descent, not necessarily of &#8216;Oriental&rsquo; descent. And no, most Slavs are not Asiatic either.</p>
<p>Remember the Deutsche Ostsiedlung, the German &#8216;March to the East&rsquo;, to reclaim, recolonize and &#8216;reculturize&rsquo; the lands that were depopulated; starting with the Hunnic invasions up to the disastrous Thirty Years War, where Germany lost almost half her population?</p>
<p>For that matter, even early race realist writers such as Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard accounted for the differing regional physiogomies of der Deutsche volk; and their conclusion was also they were largely Slavonic and Baltic in the East, refering to them as racially &#8220;Alpine&#8221; (rather than Asian), as compared to more Nordic elements in the north and west of the country.</p>
<p>It seems to have been a MultiKult fantasy of late of European&rsquo;s supposed admixtures of/with non-European races.  Of course there is some truth to it, but it is still an exaggeration nonetheless.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not further compound the error.</p>

<p>Not my point, Melchizedek.  John Derbyshire has contributed to WN simply by being an authoritative voice for race realism, and he should not be refused entry into the ranks of WN if he were to want it simply because he&rsquo;s married to a non-white.<p>Just as races are not equal in capabilities, neither are individuals within those races.  With his intelligence, erudition, insight, and life experience, John Derbyshire is worth a whole wilderness of &#8220;race purists&#8221; howling for his exclusion from the white race, who know nothing about &#8220;race preservation&#8221; except to decry &#8220;race-mixing,&#8221; and who know everything about the white race&rsquo;s genes but nothing about its merits and soul.

		<p>Sardonicus and whiteraven, you might be interested in consulting the Wiki article on &#8220;Indo-Aryan migrations&#8221; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/d8mywv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/d8mywv</a><br>
<p>According to that extensively cross-referenced article, &#8220;India, home to only a single branch of the Indo-European language family (i.e. Indo-Aryan), is an exceedingly unlikely candidate for the Indo-European homeland.&#8221;  Moreover, it quotes Edwin Bryant&rsquo;s 2001 work on &#8220;The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate&#8221; as follows: &#8220;All scholars, whatever position they might hold on the ultimate homeland of the Indo-Europeans, accept that the Indo-Aryans, at least, entered India from the West.&#8221;  <p>I think it safe to say that the &#8220;Out of India&#8221; scenarios for some kind of eternal autochthonous Indian race, propounded with such fervor by some on this thread, are informed by Hindu religious fanaticism, not historical, linguistic, or scientific evidence.</p></p></p>

<p>Zorba_the_Greek: John Derbyshire has contributed really nothing to WN. He minself has contributed nothi.g to race realist theory - he just happens to believe most to be true - but then so do a whole lot of mainstream psychologist and other human scientists.</p>
<p>Actually Derbyshire is even worse than the average ignorant multicult lemming. The fact that he knows and understands racial differences and is completely au fait with the aims and philosophy of WN including the precarious position the white race finds itself in - and still marries an oriental and produces mixed race offspring means he is completely indifferent to the fate of our race. At least most non racially aware whites can plead ignorance as a defense. Derbyshire cannot.</p>
<p>Derbyshire can never ever be a WN. He can never ever oppose miscegenation without looking and being a total and utter hypocrite. And if one does not oppose miscegenation, one is not a WN. </p>

		<p>But, El Caudillo, I WAS in the west of Germany, the EXTREME WEST (in Boppard, Freiberg, and the Strausborg area [the city itself is actually in France]) and I did not see these &#8220;Nordic&#8221; types, not a one.</p>
<p>This is only one of the popular conceptions about Germany that I felt was not based on truth. Of course, this is only my experience, but I was aware of what I was looking for, and I looked very hard, leading some, I think, to believe that I was with the police.  </p>
<p>My point was that, given a small admixture, a man can still have, as Zorba says, the &#8220;merit and soul&#8221; of the European race. I am more in the Camp of the Saints than the ignoramuses who refused me entry into the extreme WN group, although I would not have joined, anyway.</p>
<p>This completely materialistic way of looking at racial purity just rubs me the wrong way. Of course genetics is a big part, but so is what a person&rsquo;s mind and soul does with those genetics.</p>

		<p>Hi AngloCelt Francophile -</p>
<p>Well, the extreme West of Germany is an interesting example. There is likely a fairly strong admixture with Mediterranean French genes due to the borders changing various times with France throughout its history.  Also, many Germans from the agricultural east settled in the industrialized west looking for work, especially in the Ruhr (ever hear of the Ruhrpolen?).</p>
<p>I know what you mean overall, however, with the look of many Germans. I myself have been to Berlin and Frankfurt-am-Main, and have noticed that the Nordic look was not seemingly common   &mdash;   it was definitely evident, just not common.  </p>
<p>I think that as many race realist men have written, many Germans, on average, are a Nordic-Alpine mix.  Again, this was due to the Slavs and Baltic peoples settling within Germany due to drastic population losses, particularly with the disastrous Thirty Years War.</p>
<p>And these people are completely German!  German culture did a really good job of assimilating various European peoples: Evidence the magnificent Königreich Preußen   &mdash;   The Kingdom of Prussia   &mdash;   where many of its original inhabitants were of Slavic and Baltic descent.  </p>
<p>Since the German Ost was very rural, it was further in need of additional people to help settle and develop it. Frederick encouraged Europeans from many lands to come and help build the state during the Deutsche Ostsiedlung (March to the East).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that it was possible for an agricultural state of few millions of inhabitants, on a small territory, without a fleet or direct maritime commerce, and with comparatively little manufacturing industry, to maintain, in some respects, the position of a great European power. Truly amazing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;The army was magnificent. Frederick had devised Europe&rsquo;s first-ever battle-scale maneuvers in 1743, which gave his generals invaluable peacetime experience in directing large scale bodies of troops.&#8221; (Duffy - &#8220;Instrument of War&#8221; Vol I p 117) </p>
<p>Thanks to Der Große König, Friedrich der Große [Frederick the Great], the province of Brandenburg-Prussia was turned into a major European and world power.</p>

<p>Even northern Italians came and settled in Berlin, with a distinguished soldier by the name of Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprera de Montecuccoli (there is a name for you) becoming the second Deutscher Reichskanzler (chancellor) of the recently united German Reich following Otto von Bismarck.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi</a></p>
<p>So much for German/Prussian &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo;!</p>
<p>I understand your broader point, ACF, and it is well-taken.  I completely agree with your sober point that, to qoute you &#8220;a completely materialistic way of looking at racial purity just rubs me the wrong way. Of course genetics is a big part, but so is what a person&rsquo;s mind and soul does with those genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>How true!</p>
<p>I think what Frederick accomplished with his state and kingdom has conclusively shown what you say is indeed correct, that men of high character and integrity can, and indeed do, make excellent citizens and patriots for their country and people. Regardless of their particular ethnic ancestries, they all possessed the &ldquo;merit and soul&rdquo; of the European race, and the Teutonic people.</p>
<p>Good dialogue with you, mein bruder!</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Derbyshire is simply a race realist - like Steve Sailer he recognizes racial differences in ability, and believes these to be mainly genetic.</p>
<p>But he is not a white preservationist. His views, I believe, are more or less follow Sailer&rsquo;s &lsquo;citizenist&rsquo; approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And right there you are hitting the nail on the head about those two!</p>
<p>Look, it is all well and good that they recognize and even work for the preservation of Western Civilization, but they are not white preservationists. They cannot be, since they (for all of their writings about genetic interests/imperatives) have embraced multiculturalism as their choice ideology via reproduction. They may decry and reject all of its Marxist and anti-white dictums in theory, but they have embraced them at a biologically practical level. What I think it all boils down to for them (and the link to that Sailer article does reinforce this,) is that they want their racially mixed offspring to be accepted as nominal whites for all their virtues of thought, and not the vices of their actions.</p>
<p>Or put another way, they want a &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; multiculturalism and not a left wing version of it.</p>
<p>The best to you both,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Come on folks, when will you learn that the only race is of Human origin? Why is it that some are still caught up on the subject of black/white relationships. Grow up and realize that character is the more important issue. Can&rsquo;t you see that a country divided against it self will never prosper? Europe along with other countries are way ahead of the US when it comes to this subject. This is so childish and just plain stupid. Interracial relationships will never go away because of any particular personal opinion so suck it up. If you don&rsquo;t like it then find yourself some far away island and create a colony of separatist like yourself. Then you can all sit around and see what other kind of divisive opinions you could come up with since it seems that some folks are simply bent on ignorance and refuse to grow up. Some of these post seem to come from people who are still living in the dark ages.</p>
<p>One another note, wonder what some white male ancestors were thinking when they tip toed to the slave cabin in order to rape a black woman who wanted nothing to do with him. Back then I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re no blacks wanting anything to do with whites so who was at fault then. It is because of those actions so many African Americans have mixed blood today. They don&rsquo;t like to acknowledge it because they are ashamed of that part of their heritage. Would you blame then, I sure couldn&rsquo;t. Ugly is what ugly does.<br>

		<p>&#8220;As I am already weary of pointing out, reductionist &ldquo;race purists&rdquo; who look as the white race as a bundle of haplotypes are missing the forest for the trees. White people aren&rsquo;t going to have their racial consciousness raised by obiter dicta about alphabet soup genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just it Zorba; an Asian is not any more white than a Zulu is.  As white men, we don&rsquo;t judge WM/AW couples as harshly as BM/WF couples, but white woman might, in the agregate, say the opposite.  Besides, I doubt any of us would be happy to see our fair eyed daughters in relationships with &#8220;Tahaka Fukodome.&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, there are utterly deranged fanatics in our movement who would write off anyone as &ldquo;nonwhite,&rdquo; whose ancestry is not north of the Danube, and totally excludes those to the east of the Oder and west of the Rhine. I am, however, not one of them;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about these types.  Most of them are cranks (at the very least) and next to NOBODY takes them all that seriously.</p>

<p>EverydayPeople: Do you have any evidence to support that? I was actually under the impression that that was actually rare. Although I am sure it happened, I have a feeling that its occurrence is greatly exaggerated. </p>
<p>Also, regarding your first paragraph: Your fallacy does not pass muster. In the early-mid 20 Century, commonly accepted science made it obvious Blacks are not a different species. We all have now accepted that all Humans are the same species. You would be correct that this is progress. However, with scientific trends, you are actually &#8220;behind&#8221; us. Once the Far-Left is symbolically overthrown, racial differences will be proved. And Society will accept the idea that, though we are the same species, we still have different branches of races and sub-specieses. We are fortunately out of one extreme; now, we will get out of the other extreme, and be in the correct middle.  </p>
<p>Within a generation, many will tell those of your racial opinion to get &#8220;with the times.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Princeton University recently did a study of online dating (source: free Yahoo personal ads); and the studies authors discovered that white women were LESS interested in dating outside their race than white men are, and by a considerable margin. And the white women who were open to dating black men were the less-well educated. Kind of encouraging, I think.</p>

		<p>Proof in in the pudding people.<br>
A WN should be judged by their deeds.<br>
i.e. &#8216;Ideally&rsquo; how many White children you have had or after you&rsquo;re past that stage of life how you influence other Whites to appreciate their cultural and biological heritages.<br>
Fathers/Mothers and Grandfathers/Grandmothers can be great infuences on their descendants.<br>
And even a &#8216;genetic traitor&rsquo; can still talk the truth, sure you don&rsquo;t want to hear &#8220;do as I say, not as I do&#8221;.<br>
And sure a WN who produces non-white offspring odviousily isn&rsquo;t &#8216;walking the walk&rsquo;, and they may wat to leave their kids at home when talking at a Amren conference. <br>
But we need to be inclusive, not always looking for people to remove off the list.<br>
My family is Catholic and I was told when I was young that we were on the bad list with most WN&rsquo;s of the time as were gays and the Jewish etc.<br>
In saying that who wants pedofiles or psychopaths in their mists (unless theirs a War for the latter perhaps). <br>
When White woman of child baring age are 2% of the Worlds population I think we have to be more inclusive and broader.<br>
Our exclusive club is getting ridiculously small and frankly &#8220;you attract more flies with honey&#8221;.<br>
And as for race mixing that has always occurred when two ethno-nations have over lapped or touched borders.<br>
<a href="https://racialreality.110mb.com/tatc.html" rel="nofollow">https://racialreality.110mb.com/tatc.html</a><br>
Our current problems lie in the fact that we are not even recognised as a group offically who are worth perserving, the speed of current forced mixing and the acceptable ratio&rsquo;s of mixing we should be looking for (currently there are no ideal ratio&rsquo;s).<br>
I know that &#8216;none&rsquo; would be the hardliners ideal, but look around people we&rsquo;re no longer in charge. <br>
We are only in charge of ourselves and our thoughts at the end of the day.</p>

		<p>Sardonicus and whiteraven, you might be interested in consulting the Wiki article on &ldquo;Indo-Aryan migrations&rdquo; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/d8mywv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/d8mywv</a></p>
<p><br>
According to that extensively cross-referenced article, &ldquo;India, home to only a single branch of the Indo-European language family (i.e. Indo-Aryan), is an exceedingly unlikely candidate for the Indo-European homeland.&rdquo; Moreover, it quotes Edwin Bryant&rsquo;s 2001 work on &ldquo;The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;All scholars, whatever position they might hold on the ultimate homeland of the Indo-Europeans, accept that the Indo-Aryans, at least, entered India from the West.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I think it safe to say that the &ldquo;Out of India&rdquo; scenarios for some kind of eternal autochthonous Indian race, propounded with such fervor by some on this thread, are informed by Hindu religious fanaticism, not historical, linguistic, or scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Posted by Zorba_the_Geek at 10:58 PM on April 25 </p>
<p></p>
<p>          Zorba the Geek, </p>
<p>          Nice try with the character assasination. <br>
          So if there is evidence to show that India is<br>
          the original homeland of IE peoples/languages <br>
          and there are serious supporters of it based<br>
          on objective evidence, they must all be &#8220;Hindu<br>
          fanatics&#8221;, right??   What a logic??        <br>
        </p>
<p>          The reason that India is home to only one branch of<br>
          IE languages (ie. Indo-Aryan) is because the other <br>
          branches left the country due to the migrations of<br>
          Indo-European speaking Indian tribes like the Druhyus<br>
          and Anus, so yeah, obviously, you won&rsquo;t find the other<br>
          IE branches today in present day India.  Nothing <br>
          surprising about that.  </p>
<p><br>
          But linguistic evidence shows that there is a language<br>
          spoken in India today called Bangani language that <br>
          shows in its oldest layers evidence of a Kentum <br>
          substratum with Satem overlayers later on in the<br>
          structure of the language.  In other words, India has<br>
          a language, even today, spoken that belongs to the <br>
          Kentum branch.  All the European languages with the <br>
          exception of Greek belong to the Kentum branch of the<br>
          Indo-European language family.  The Iranic, Greek and<br>
          Indo-Aryan languages belong to the Satem branch of IE.</p>
<p><br>
          What this means is that India is the only country in <br>
          the Indo-European speaking world that has living proof<br>
          of a Kentum language (ie. Bangani)and Satem languages <br>
          like Indo-Aryan.  That is a big proof of the <br>
          incompatibility of an Indo-European intrusion from the<br>
          West.   The original IE homeland had both the Kentum <br>
          and Satem branches of the IE family.  </p>
<p><br>
          The Druhyu tribe that left India were the Kentum <br>
          speakers that spread their dialects into Central Asia-<br>
          Caucasus regions which the Europeans acquired through<br>
          the phenomenon called &#8220;elite dominance&#8221;.   Another<br>
          Indian tribe known as the Anus, were Iranic speakers<br>
          that also migrated Westwards into Afghanistan, Iran <br>
          and further into South-Eastern Europe.  That is the <br>
          reason why Greek has so much similarities to the <br>
          Iranic and Sanskrit language (ie. Indo-Aryan) than it<br>
          does to the other European languages in terms of <br>
          linguistic innovations post-IE dispersal.  That could<br>
          only be if Greek was situated in a geographical area<br>
          that was proximate to the Iranic and Indo-Aryan <br>
          speakers which could only be the North-Western part<br>
          of Indian subcontinent (ie. Modern Pakistan)!   </p>
<p><br>
          Another logical fallacy you made, Zorba, is the appeal<br>
          to authority.  The case matters on the facts and the<br>
          viability of the arguments, not on the authorities in<br>
          this matter.  </p>
<p><br>

          from India and the evidence from various fields of <br>

                 Sardonicus, </p>
<p>                 As a continuation to my above post about<br>
                 the Caste System, I would like to put forth<br>
                 a counter-question to you if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p><br>
                 Just for the sake of argument, if the caste<br>
                 system was organized on the basis of skin <br>
                 color as you and other White nationalists <br>
                 allege, then how come there are many dark-<br>
                 skinned &#8220;upper caste&#8221; Indians and light skinned<br>
                 &#8220;lower castes&#8221;?   Shouldn&rsquo;t it be strictly<br>
                  100 % light skinned for every member of <br>
                  the &#8220;upper caste&#8221; and 100% dark-skinned for<br>
                  every member of the &#8220;lower castes&#8221;??  But that<br>
                 obviously isn&rsquo;t the case at all.    </p>
<p><br>
               <br>
                 If you argue saying that there was mass mixing<br>
                 which led to this dichotomy, then everyone <br>
                 would technically be of one caste or no caste<br>
                 at all.  In other words, there would be no need<br>
                 for a Caste System.  It would become redundant.<br>
                 But people still follow it and live by it.   </p>
<p><br>
                 Another argument you could make is that the<br>
                 &#8220;invading Aryans&#8221; intermarried with some of <br>
                  the natives and,their descendants became the <br>
                  Brahmins or the &#8220;upper caste&#8221; and the non-<br>
                 Brahmins being the &#8220;lower caste&#8221;.  But there<br>
                 is a problem with this scenario as well.  If  <br>
             this was the case, then there should have been only<br>
                 TWO castes at the most.  But there are FIVE <br>
                 social groupings including the Dalits.   <br>
                 This proves that the system was never organized<br>
                 on the basis of race/color.   The real reason <br>
                 for its existence and organization is for the<br>
                 reasons I mentioned in my above post, namely<br>
                 occupation and innate character.  </p>
<p><br>
                 Take a look at the quotes from the various <br>
                 Hindu literature I quoted above in my other <br>
                 post.   The answer is there.  <br>

<p>Notice that all the alleged killers of these English women are described in the most vaguest of terms   &mdash;   &#8216;a male, age 20&rsquo; for example.</p>
<p>So you know what THAT means.<br>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do the same with your deluded, utopian fanatics   &mdash;   and your envious, malcontent &#8216;friends&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>Indians and light skinned<br>
&ldquo;lower castes&rdquo;? Shouldn&rsquo;t it be strictly<br>
100 % light skinned for every member of <br>
the &ldquo;upper caste&rdquo; and 100% dark-skinned for<br>
every member of the &ldquo;lower castes&rdquo;?? But that<br>
obviously isn&rsquo;t the case at all. </p>
<p> Not necessarily RN that is my point. There has been intermixture in the upper classes over thousands of years but less in the lower castes. The lower castes have remained predominately very dark.  Many of the remaining lighter skinned people are in the higher castes. </p>

               Zorba the geek, </p>
<p>               The evidence for the Indian tribal migrations <br>
               from India is backed up by the Rig-Veda and the<br>
               Persian Avesta.  Before you condemn these sources<br>
               as &#8220;religious&#8221; and therefore unreliable, you <br>
               should know that the scholars acknowledge these<br>
               works as important in the reconstruction of Indo-<br>
               European history and accept them as such.  <br>
               So these sources are fair game in the debate.  </p>
<p><br>
               The Avesta knows around 20 homelands, if I <br>
               remember correctly, listed in the Vendidad/<br>
               Videvdad that mentions the lands that the Iranics<br>
               inhabited in the course of their history.  This<br>
               may surprise you but none of those lands are <br>
               located in Central Asia or even in Modern Iran.<br>
               Most of them are located in Afghanistan and in<br>
               fact the area of Pakistan(ie Punjab and kashmir).</p>
<p><br>
               Take a look at this book:  The Life and Times of<br>
                                          Zoroaster by Roberto<br>
                                          Gnoli.    </p>
<p><br>
               The Rig-Veda knows only the Indian geography and<br>
               no other.  The dating of the Rig-Veda is  <br>
               immensely important for Indo-European history <br>
               because it would tell us approximately how long <br>
               IE languages have been in India.  The Rig-Veda<br>
               knows two rivers in India that once existed, <br>
               namely the Sarasvati and the Drshadvati rivers. <br>
               Recent excavations and satellite imagery have <br>
               rediscovered the dried up river beds of these <br>
               lost rivers as described in the Rig-Veda.  <br>
               The Sarasvati dried up completely by 2000 BC and<br>
               the Drshadvati by 2600 BC.  The Rig-Veda <br>
               describes these two rivers as being mighty in <br>
               their flow at one time, so the logical conclusion<br>
               is inescapable that the Rig-Veda must be before<br>
               at least 3000 BC in its composition and not <br>
               after 1500 BC as standard history text-books say.</p>
<p> <br>
               What this means is that Indo-European speakers<br>
               must have been living in India prior to 3000 BC<br>
               as the Rig-Veda is composed in Vedic Sanskrit, <br>
               undoubtedly an Indo-European language.  </p>
<p>               As for the Mittani, note carefully that the <br>
               Mittani kingdom contained a population that spoke<br>
               Hurrian, a NON-INDO-EUROPEAN language.  The elite<br>
               of this society were INDO-ARYAN speakers who <br>
               worshipped Vedic deities and used the same <br>
               Sanskritic terminologies for their Gods like<br>
               Inar/Indra, Nasatya, Varuna ect.  That could only<br>
               be if there had been an Indo-Aryan migration from<br>
               India, perhaps during or soon after the decline<br>
               of the Indus Valley Civilization around this time<br>
               (ie. 1400-1500 BC).   The language of the Mittani<br>
               was differentiated already from Indo-Iranian or<br>
               even early Iranian.  Here is the quote from the<br>
               article you cited, Zorba:  </p>
<p><br>
                &#8220;The numeral aika &#8220;one&#8221; is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has &#8220;aiva&#8221;) in general&#8221;.        </p>
<p><br>
                   As for the Bangani language, you are mistaken<br>
                   Zorba.  A counter study was done by Anvita <br>
                   Abbi and Hans Hock.  Their study refuted<br>
                   the claims made by Georg Van Driem and Suhnu<br>
                   Ram Sharma.    </p>
<p>                   Here is the reason why Zoller sticks to his <br>
                   case:  </p>
<p>                   <a href="https://www-personal.umich.edu/~pehook/bangani.zoller.html" rel="nofollow">https://www-personal.umich.edu/~pehook/bangani.zoller.html</a>  </p>
<p><br>
                   It is in fact accepted that Bangani contains<br>
                   the substratum of a Kentum language <br>
                   overlayered with Satem features of a more <br>
                   recent nature.      </p>
<p><br>
                   The very fact that there is even one language<br>
                   in India with Kentum connections is a strong<br>
                   indicator of an Indian homeland theory.  <br>
                   Just because there are kentum languages <br>
                   outside of India, located North and West <br>
                   doesn&rsquo;t undermine the possibility of India<br>
                   being the original homeland at all!  </p>
<p><br>
                   I would recommend to you Zorba to read those <br>
                   above links.  It is quite scholarly argued<br>
                   and not simply propaganda as you seem to <br>
                   allege.  </p>
<p><br>
                   By the way, I found it amusing that you are<br>
                   using the &#8220;ji&#8221; and &#8220;gora&#8221;.  Are you actually<br>
                   an Indian or even a Persian in reality <br>
                   pretending to be White?  </p>
<p>                   Hope to hear from you.<br>
                 </p>
<p>               <br>
               <br>
              </p>
