			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tubman, Jack and Jill Politics, April 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Were you wondering what happened to all the rabid, wild-eyed bigots yelling, &#8220;Kill him!&#8221; and &#8220;Terrorist&#8221; and &#8220;Socialist&#8221; carrying stuffed monkey plush dolls at the McCain-Palin rallies? It&rsquo;s easy in our jubilation over Obama&rsquo;s victory to forget the many people in America who were deeply fearful and hate-oriented towards an Obama presidency. Those people didn&rsquo;t just shrug their shoulders at the Democratic victory in Nov 2008. No, they&rsquo;ve re-organized. Largely abandoned by the Republican party who tapped cynically into their ignorance, fear and hatred and whipped these folks into a racist lather as a Get Out The Vote strategy, the Tax Day Tea Party people have used the internet to find each other and organize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting plenty of news coverage. And don&rsquo;t get me wrong: the teabaggers (heh) have expressed some legitimate concerns about the impact of the economic stimulus on the ballooning deficit and the evolving structure of the financial bailout strategy. Concerns some progressives and many Americans share actually. Yet Obama&rsquo;s kept his promise to lower taxes for most Americans except the very wealthy  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t know about you but I definitely am getting more back than I expected personally on my own taxes. So&hellip;whassup, really? Are these folks really concerned about their taxes going up or is it about what they perceive their taxes to be funding? Here&rsquo;s an image from the Michelle Malkin blog that sums up their real concerns, IMHO  &mdash;  note the bloody imagery, btw.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been parsing the words and the racists have been very careful to cover their tracks and fury that a black man is President. But not well enough. I&rsquo;m starting to become pretty convinced at this point that &#8220;socialist&#8221; is some kind of code word for &#8220;nigger&#8221;. </p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;re against Obama, you&rsquo;re obviously a hardcore delusional racist xenophobe and should be villified as such.</p>
<p>As for that last bit about socialists and blacks, it&rsquo;s only true in the sense that both love leeching off of the welfare of harder working people.  Just ask Scandinavians or the the British.</p>

The liberal media has been working overtime trying to expose this grass roots movement as organized and led by the far right.</p>
<p>On cable, the two top mock new programs, Colbert Report and The Daily Show, both ran segments alleging that these events are anything but grass roots.</p>
<p>The left uses mocking comedy to demonize whites.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s funny.  I was beginning to think that &#8220;progressive taxes&#8221; was code word for taxing white men to pay for feminists and people of color.  Silly me.</p>

<p>Just who and what made these people afraid in the first place? When black folks were (supposedly) afraid of whites, the whole world had to shut down to make sure a little school girl would never be afraid (complete with much commentating and endless discussion). Now that white folks (all of a sudden) are afraid of blacks, this just shows that whites folks are racist and are in need of correction. One thing is always constant, Whites = bad, blacks = good. </p>

			<p>All this adds up to is that nobody is supposed to criticize this guy who is the president. So if it means screaming racist, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to be done. However, there were some very nice people at the Tea Party I was at and the blacks are [going to the well once too often] with their &#8220;racist&#8221; malarkey. What their doing is alienating many people who otherwise would be in their camp.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing fine for once. Our adversaries are running scared. They&rsquo;re confused. They don&rsquo;t know what to do to control us at this point. I&rsquo;ve got a good feeling this thing is going to gain momentum all by itself. That it&rsquo;s got a life all its own. There&rsquo;s no putting this genie back in the bottle. Fasten your seatbelts, we&rsquo;re in for a bumpy ride.</p>

			<p>I actually did just shrug my shoulders at Obama&rsquo;s victory. With Bush&rsquo;s lousy record and McCain&rsquo;s anemic campaign, Republicans certainly did not deserve victory. The gushing over Obama was and continues to be embarassing but I really don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m waiting for something new to come along. I&rsquo;m done with Republicans. </p>

<p>Like you, I have heard leftists spout off about these tea parties being designed by billionaires and cable news channels.  You tend to see in other people the qualities you have in yourself   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s called transferrance.  Even if those qualities are not the predominant part of the other person&rsquo;s personality, you see them because that is what you are yourself.</p>
<p>The left is only transferring its own self (George Soros astroturfers) on some other movement.</p>

			<p>Man these black folks sure get scared whenever Whites get together for a cause don&rsquo;t they. Whats so funny is that these &#8220;tea parties&#8221; have NOTHING to do with them, they&rsquo;re a protest against BIG GOVERNMENT - - that&rsquo;s it. Blacks always think everythings about THEM. They just can&rsquo;t seem to understand that Whites don&rsquo;t think about their race 24\7 like they do. Unlike them, most Whites want what&rsquo;s best for their country, reguardless of race.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s times like these that I&rsquo;m most gratified in being an open &#8220;racist&#8221; (the textbook definition doesn&rsquo;t apply, but since when does anyone use the textbook definition?  Hence the scare-quotes).</p>
<p>I have nothing to hide.  I&rsquo;ll tell blacks straight to their faces I don&rsquo;t care for them, as a race.  I&rsquo;ll tell them straight to their faces I want to live apart from them, that I don&rsquo;t want to carry them or have the sweat of my brow stolen from me to support them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want &#8220;racial healing.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t want to make blacks happy, or wealthy, or smart.  I don&rsquo;t want &#8220;dialogue.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t CARE about blacks, or their problems, or their jealousies, or inadequacies.  I want to be free to live amongst my own kind.</p>
<p>I want my freedom to pursue happiness restored.  Until it is, America is a sham.</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t &#8220;Capitalists&#8221; to use Marx&rsquo;s word. People who worship money and greed are sick, I don&rsquo;t care what color they are. Western civilization does, however, respect the sacred institution of private property and the personal right to protect and improve one&rsquo;s own belongings. &#8220;Capital,&#8221; if you will. </p>

			<p> Sounds like &#8220;Jill Tubman&#8221; is just as paranoid and &#8220;eat up&#8221; with seeing racists under the bed, behind the door and in the woodpile, as most people of her ilk. By the way: Wonder if &#8220;Tubman&#8221; is her real last name   &mdash;   or did she just appropriate it to honor a black so-called &#8220;heroine&#8221;?</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s &#8216;grassroots&rsquo; either, and I&rsquo;m a loyal AmRen supporter. Not saying I disagree with it. I&rsquo;d prefer a different issue be protested. </p>

			<p>There will be a similar rally here (high taxes,) in Westchester County, N.Y. (home of the Clintons,) on the 25th of this month. I am going to attend for the sole purpose of spreading the word of American Renaisasance, by handing out flyers. (To the white people of course.) You know, plant a few seeds.</p>
<p>This could be the start of something big! Wish me luck. <br>

			<p>Are these tea parties really grass roots or are they sponsored by big corporations and neocon shills?  I don&rsquo;t know but at some these events they&rsquo;ve had a few pseudo-conservatives like Alan Keyes show up at the events to make speeches. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m delighted that someone is identifying all the tea partiers as white racialists!</p>
<p>I hope that idea keeps getting hammered in until the tea partiers have come to believe it themselves, without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Being overrun by a changing zeitgeist makes a convert much more easily than does the thankless effort of reasoning with people.</p>

<p>Really, Ms. Tubman?  You just paid your taxes for LAST year.  And a lot of her ilk don&rsquo;t pay their fare share in taxes anyway - but you will still pay.  You&rsquo;ll pay in declining purchasing power as the result of massive inflation.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that there might be something to their claims that the tea-parties are not &#8220;grass-roots&#8221; efforts.  I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention to them, but a lot of the usual subjects have been touting them - Sean Hannity, for example.  Hannity isn&rsquo;t a conservative - he&rsquo;s just a shill for the republican party - a hack.  The democratic party is the natural party for traitors and commies, but that doesn&rsquo;t make the republicans the answer to our problems.  George W. Bush did more (save perhaps Obama - we shall see) than any single president to wreck this country.</p>
<p>We certainly don&rsquo;t need more of the same old republican party rhetoric.</p>
<p>And, Ms. Tubman, you are welcome to think anything you like of me calling you, or your idol Obama, a socialist.  I really don&rsquo;t care what black people think - not one little bit.</p>

			<p>I wish this sort of enthusiasm  &mdash;  be it a media extrapalation or not  &mdash;  could be drummed up for protecting our southern border and removing the invaders already here.  The stimulus is chump change compared to what we are in store for over the next few decades.  White men will be huring worse, much worse, than they are now.</p>

			<p>     The blogger states the obvious: the rallies were overwhelm-<br>
ingly White. Blacks aren&rsquo;t interested in the message-in fact they<br>
percieve correctly that it is quite hostile to their interests<br>
and lifestyle. And consequently, he slanders the Whites involved.<br>
But the Whites&hellip;! They wouldn&rsquo;t dream of mentioning Race. Race<br>
has nothing to do with it! These Ron Paulists and Birchers act-<br>
ally think we can take back this country without dealing with<br>
Race. Obviously, when the welfare runs out, the minorities are<br>
going to riot. Obviously these minorities, particularly the Blacks will never fit into a Traditional Republic in which people<br>
take of themselves. We are going to have to fight a race war if<br>
only to separate ourselves from these parasites. Of course, if <br>
we were complely united we could back them down. But that&rsquo;s not<br>
going to happen either. We would need a centralized goverment to<br>
do that and that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s killing us.</p>

			<p>One reason for the leftwing fear and loathing of the anti-tax movement is that for all these decades, the left has claimed to speak for the &#8220;people&#8221;. Yet here we have the people   &mdash;   and indeed, the anti-tax movement has a strong working class element   &mdash;   in a movement which is not controlled by the left. No wonder the left does not have a clue what to do, other than scream names and throw tantrums.</p>

That in some survey more people thought Tina Fey was actually Sarah Palin, than thought the real Sarah Palin was actually  herself.</p>

			<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>Good question about the neocons. The one I was at was in a cold hard driving rain at the beach. There were at least eight hundred people there and not one of them that I could see was one of those neocon jerks. But if this thing starts getting going good, they&rsquo;ll all show up. I hadn&rsquo;t even thought of that. If one or more of them shows up at anything I&rsquo;m involved with, I&rsquo;m running him off.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, this is the &#8220;Ron Paul&#8221; people who are running this. I supported Ron Paul and they never broke up their organization after he lost. They&rsquo;re active people and we haven&rsquo;t heard the last from them by a long shot.</p>
<p>Take care and have a good day.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They just can&rsquo;t seem to understand that Whites don&rsquo;t think about their race 24\7 like they do. Unlike them, most Whites want what&rsquo;s best for their country, reguardless of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem here with whites. Blacks are already racialist to the core. Whites are intellectual and make things abstract and about principle, but sometimes forget the material basis for those principles. Some clues for the confused:</p>
<p>Western civilization = the kind of society only white people can make and maintain.</p>
<p>Free men living under limited government = again a white man&rsquo;s idea, but really best maintained by the Germanic cultures including Anglo-Saxon cultures. Before the Bill of Rights we had the &#8220;Rights of Englishman.&#8221; Nothing similar in China, not in India, not in Africa, not anywhere except among whites.</p>
<p>Personal responsibility = again a white concept. Don&rsquo;t expect this among blacks or hispanics or asians, because they all think in terms of corporate/collective responsibility. Notice these non-white youth always go around in gangs and groups. </p>
<p>Respect for personal property = again this is a white man&rsquo;s institution. You won&rsquo;t find it among blacks (who enjoy destroying property, their own and other people&rsquo;s) or  hispanics (who share everything and live 20 people in one house). </p>
<p>Freedom of conscience = this gets white into a lot of trouble as a race because we quibble over principle and divided we fall. Notice Freedom of Speech is really a specifically Anglo-Saxon-AMERICAN institution that exists nowhere else in the world. If we leave it up to the Commies, this freedom of speech will be extinguished in America too.</p>
<p>Relative respect for women = Good luck finding this among blacks and browns, ladies. Probably some of us think this has gone too far with women throwing their feminine role as mothers and nurturers in the garbage to try to replace men in the work force. If you think cooking and cleaning and a little tender loving care and comfort around the house for your husband and children (future of your stock) is a burden, look into what women do in Africa or the Arab world. </p>
<p>Scientific advancement = Again, good luck finding this among blacks and browns. </p>
<p>An orderly society = ditto. Asians can do this and copy science too, but they are far away and living in their own self-contained sphere. They aren&rsquo;t taking in hordes of immigrants either. </p>
<p>So there is the problem. Whites think of all these things as abstract &#8220;principles&#8221; or slogans on a piece of cardboard, but they need to remember these institutions are coded in the biological nature of white Europeans and nobody else. For whites, these virtues are your non-transferable birthright, so if you throw them away on the blacks or the brown immigrants, they are gone. Forever. </p>

<p>So, &#8220;progressive taxes&#8221; pay for feminists? My gosh, to think that all these years I have been working and paying my own taxes! That would save me over $700 per month in property taxes alone. Thanks for the heads up, man!</p>

			<p>Go to the site, and read some of the comments.  The open, boiling hatred of white folk is imminently apparent.  I find it difficult to believe that the people that engorge their minds with this kind of tripe will suddenly, or even gradually, realize the error of their ways.  They will openly incite riot, and call for the imprisonment and subjugation of those who disagree with them.  Just look at the DHS Extremism report.  It is a sign of things to come.  And the things to come are much worse&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;they&rsquo;ve had a few pseudo-conservatives like Alan Keyes show up at the events to make speeches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally, I love Alan Keyes and every thing I&rsquo;ve heard him say. It&rsquo;s kind of obvious, tho, that it&rsquo;s his shtick to say whatever it is conservative white folks want to hear. I remember when he equated taxes with slavery during his presidential run, and was perhaps speaking for effect. Steve Forbes, another candidate that same year, was calling for a &#8216;flat-tax&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sure Keyes believes some/much of what he says, but it can seem like a show sometimes, where he&rsquo;s endlessly trying to please white folks. So, it pretty much makes Keyes like the black version of almost every white public official in America. Make that almost every white person in America. Anything less would be unsafe.   <br>

			<p>There was a black speaker at the tea party I was at (Seattle) and people were cheering her on&hellip;  No one called her a &#8220;socialist&#8221;, wink wink.  Pardon us if there are still a few level-headed people left (and by that, I mean right) who don&rsquo;t want our government to control every aspect of our lives.  When your government gives you everything, it owns you.<br>
  Where do these morons who gleefully trumpet that &#8220;We&rsquo;re getting a big tax break THIS YEAR&#8221; think the money is going to come from?  Do they truly believe that the Federal Reserve is a magic money well that never goes dry?<br>
  Yes, 1% of US citizens hold 27% of the wealth&hellip; but that same 1% pays 45% of the taxes&hellip;  And that&rsquo;s beside the point, who cares how much of the wealth that 1% holds, it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business but theirs!  They worked hard for it, or received it by right of inheritance, in which case their parents worked hard for it! Why should they be forced to give it away to a bunch of lazy whiners who have no stake in this country because they pay no taxes?! Of course those who don&rsquo;t expect to pay the bill don&rsquo;t care how high the taxes are going to have to go in four years to pay for this monstrous deficit!  It absolutely blows my mind.<br>
  Here&rsquo;s my idea: Anyone who wants to receive a welfare check has to be a slave to the nation. We&rsquo;ll lock a special GPS tracking choker around your neck so that we know you&rsquo;re on our watch.  Then you&rsquo;ll be herded to whatever part of the country we need you in where you will do manual labor working on our infrastructure, picking our apples, or helping to build a massive wall at the Mexican border.  (Whatever needs doing).  In addition, you will be commonly heralded with the appellation of &#8220;slave&#8221;.  That should get some of the leeches motivated to get off their butts. Now I understand, sometimes it&rsquo;s tough, and you almost have to ask for foodstamps, because that&rsquo;s just the way our imperfect economy presently works; hey, I&rsquo;ll admit, I&rsquo;ve had to do it.  I&rsquo;ll be the first to put a tracking device around my neck if I need government aid, just so you know this slightly humorous suggestion isn&rsquo;t coming from some wealthy elitist.<br>
  And one more thing, Jill Tubman and the rest of the left, quit slandering us for exercising our right to be heard.  When the left protests (and their rallies typically result in anarchy, whereas we started by saying the Pledge of Allegiance and didn&rsquo;t even leave a soda can behind), Hilary Clinton says that &#8220;dissent is the highest form of patriotism&#8221;, but anyone else protests and their branded extremists, radicals, and anti-government by the media.  I love that the left only cares about the Constitution (for a few minutes) when it can benefit them.</p>

			<p>It hardly matters  &mdash;  until these &#8220;tea parties&#8221; are organized around race realism, no real progress will ever be made.  There is no libertarian solution.  When the minorities are here in sufficient numbers, they will be able to exert influence by shear force.  Whites will have to pay, no matter what  &mdash;  pooling our money to jail them, pooling our money for security, pooling our to pay them off with welfare to keep the situation from degenerating further.  Race reality cannot be ignored.  This is a story of the week, nothing more.</p>

			<p>Folks, don&rsquo;t believe lefties. Lefties are shameless liars and ignorant boobs to boot. </p>
<p>The tea parties are a bandwagon the Republicans jumped on at the last minute. Talk about tea parties started with the libertarian and conspiracy theory crowd months ago. These tea parties have some real authentic grassroots support, and that is why the media people don&rsquo;t know how to react. </p>

<p>&#8220;Yet Obama&rsquo;s kept his promise to lower taxes for most Americans except the very wealthy &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know about you but I definitely am getting more back than I expected personally on my own taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sentence alone illustrates that it is impossible to wring logic or truthfulness from these people.  There is no intellectual integrity at all to be found.  Such juvenile logic, it makes me vomit. </p>

<p>If this grassroots movement gains more momentum, not only will the neocon boobs jump on the bandwagon, they&rsquo;ll try to take over the reigns and steer the horses down another path.  Be wary of any politicians like John McCain, Michael Steele, Bobby Jindal, Lyndsey Graham and John Kyle moving in to speak for us.  Perhaps Meghan McCain can show up at these events and attempt to distract us by claiming to be the voice of our youth.  If that doesn&rsquo;t work she can show pictures of her father in POW camps.  Of course, this will all be given glowing coverage by the likes of Sean Hannity and company.    </p>
