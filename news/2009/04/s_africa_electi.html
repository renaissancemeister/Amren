<h1>S. Africa Election Results Show Racial Divide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clare Nullis, AP, April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South Africa&rsquo;s ruling African National Congress neared its cherished two-thirds majority nationwide but lost power in the country&rsquo;s richest province Friday because of hostility from mixed-race voters.</p>
<p>While it was the country&rsquo;s fourth peaceful multiracial vote since the end of apartheid in 1994, the results in the Western Cape were a reminder that South Africa&rsquo;s racial divides still run deep.</p>
<p>The province is the heart of the country&rsquo;s wine and tourism industries, and also a region where mixed-race voters account for more than half the population while they are a small minority nationwide. They were treated better than blacks under apartheid&rsquo;s racist rules; now many feel marginalized and forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;I voted ANC at the first elections, but never again. Never, never. They don&rsquo;t look after us,&#8221; voter Desmonia Goff said.</p>
<p>The largely white Democratic Alliance aggressively courted mixed-race voters ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s vote and was close to gaining an outright majority in the provincial legislature there. The ANC had no hope of catching up, trailing with less than one-third of the vote, ahead of smaller opposition parties. It was a humiliating setback for the ruling party, which otherwise maintained its grip on power.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Final results were expected later Friday or early Saturday. Preliminary results from the nearly 14.5 million ballots counted so far from Wednesday&rsquo;s election showed the ANC was leading the national vote with 66.91 percent and closing in on its goal of winning at least a two-thirds majority of parliament.</p>
<p>Parliament elects South Africa&rsquo;s president by a simple majority, putting ANC leader Jacob Zuma in line for the post when the new assembly votes in May.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the ANC fails to at least match that this year, it will be seen as a message from voters that they want some limits on the party. A two-thirds majority allows the ANC to enact major budgetary plans or legislation unchallenged, or to change the constitution.</p>
<p>Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille, who has won praise for her stint as mayor of Cape Town, said ahead of the elections that her main goals were to stop the ANC&rsquo;s two thirds majority and to win the Western Cape.</p>
<p>Hundreds of supporters  &mdash;  most of them mixed-race  &mdash;  greeted her when she returned to Cape Town Friday after monitoring election results in Pretoria. Even baggage handlers and security staff danced for joy. An airline passenger with an ANC T-shirt was loudly jeered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mixed race people  &mdash;  many of whom trace their ancestry back to Malay slaves  &mdash;  enjoyed more rights than blacks under apartheid&rsquo;s racist rules, and emerged skeptical of the ANC, which they see as a black party. The ANC, though, has support from some mixed race South Africans and whites across South Africa, and politicians from both groups have prominent roles in the party.</p>
<p>Those of mixed race origin make up about half the Western Cape&rsquo;s population, while black Africans comprise about 30 percent and whites about 18 percent. This is in contrast to the national picture, where blacks account for 80 percent of the population and mixed race and whites each for 9 percent.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m curious, what are the practical (not political) obstacles to an independent white enclave in South Africa?  I&rsquo;m just not sure where the whites are scattered.  Are there any geographically contiguous areas in which whites make up the overwhelming majority that could be carved out in the future for an independent state?  Obviously the political obstacles are impossible right now.  But it would be seem that a good interim strategy would be for whites to band together in a particular area, both for protection and to plant the seeds for a future fight for political independence, once a critical mass is reached.  </p>

<p>The future of South Africa is already carved in stone.  As documented in Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s tome &#8220;The g Factor,&#8221; voluntary emigration is highly selective for g (general intelligence).  Simply put: when the going gets tough, the smart get going.</p>

<p>The smartest Whites are long gone from South Africa (and they aren&rsquo;t coming back, either).  As the blacks &#8220;tighten the screws,&#8221; more Whites will depart, taking the brighter &#8220;coloreds&#8221; with them.  Ultimately, South Africa will wind up becoming the same Zimbabwe is now.</p>

<p>Anyone looking forward to a &#8220;White enclave&#8221; being carved out of South Africa is simply not being realistic.<br>

			<p>Considerably worse then in 1994. Any and all areas of South Africa where blacks were nonexistent or a small minority have been flooded by deliberate government policy. Blacks account for about 30& of Western Cape province today, but just 20 years ago it was less than 15%. Likewise the business area of Gauteng was overwhelmingly white, until recently when it became majority black. The ANC encourage immigration from other Sub-Saharan blacks who are then systematically settled in areas where the black numbers are not the majority. Likewise, there have been massive government-assisted operations to transfer blacks from majority-black areas to minority-black areas to deliberately alter the demographics. This is one of  the definitions of genocide under international law, but sine it&rsquo;s the ANC it&rsquo;s apparently alright. Blacks constitute 30% of Western Cape today but at least half of those were living well outside Western Cape as of 1994. </p>

<p>It would have made more sense to set up a White enclave back in 1994 when Whites still had the military muscle and political organization to do it. It&rsquo;s a little late now. A black government will not allow this simply because the loss of too many Whites means that a black majority country would collapse economically as did Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>ANC leader Jacob Zuma is the consummate third-world tinhorn dictator.  If Mr. Zuma (complete with tribal garb) were given the same amount of media coverage in the United States that NBA and NFL players receive, the sheeple might awaken from their trance.  </p>

			<p>The article was somewhat edited; how many more times did the writer feel the need to inject the phrase &#8216;apartheid&rsquo;s racist rules&rsquo; in the full work?</p>
