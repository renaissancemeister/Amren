			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah R. Kaufman, Benjamin Peim, and Carrie Melago, New York Daily News, April 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two city fast-food joints are calling themselves Obama Fried Chicken  &mdash;  and the new names are ruffling some feathers.</p>
<p>Eateries in Brooklyn and Manhattan plastered the new President&rsquo;s last name on their awnings recently.</p>
<p>And some passersby are cringing, saying the name change plays into old racial stereotypes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why name it that? Just because Obama is black, they&rsquo;re going to put his name on a fried chicken place in a black neighborhood?&#8221; said Akilah Nassy, 16, outside the Brooklyn store.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, S&T Fried Chicken on St. Nicholas Ave. in Harlem formally renamed itself after the country&rsquo;s first black President.</p>
<p>And last week, Royal Fried Chicken on Rutland Road in Brownsville, Brooklyn, did the same.</p>
<p>Staff at both eateries say the names are meant to pay homage to the new President, not offend customers or capitalize on his popularity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the owner loves Obama,&#8221; said Mohammad Jabbar, 33, manager of the Brownsville store. &#8220;He loves him seriously. He supports him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some customers in Brooklyn said it didn&rsquo;t matter what the owners&rsquo; intentions were  &mdash;  the new President&rsquo;s name shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyond the racial overtones, some critics found it distasteful that a business would try to make a profit from a historic election. &#8220;You see a lot of that in this area  &mdash;  slapping Obama&rsquo;s name on businesses to make money,&#8221; said Khayeen Adams Sr., a furniture store employee in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>In Harlem, the reaction was very different. Business was brisk, and few customers seemed offended at the restaurant, which placed a portrait of the First Family near the cash register.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m betting that the owners and managers of these chicken places are all non-white.  This Mohammed Jabbar perhaps gives credence to my theory.</p>

			<p>   Reminds me of a Utah restaurant chain from the 1920s<br>
  called the Coon Chicken Inn.It was quite controversial,<br>
  even in those days.<br>
   Google it up for a little history lesson.</p>

			<p>So naming private fried chicken joints after the new guy is offensive, but renaming public schools after him is perfectly fine?</p>

			<p>Is this just because it&rsquo;s fried chicken? Would there be controvesy over Obama Burgers or Obama Donuts? </p>

			<p>Its offensive to suggest black people like fried chicken, say the black people in black neighborhoods while they are actually eating fried chicken at fried chicken joints? Makes sense&hellip;. Why don&rsquo;t they just admit they like fried chicken and end this silly controversy? Almost everybody likes fried chicken. I am Italian and I had ravioli for dinner. Its true, shocking ain&rsquo;t it. Who cares?</p>

			<p>Recently, we were watching Family Feud and a black family had made it to the end where they answer the questions with the host. One of the questions was &#8220;What food would you bring to a picnic?&#8221; The black woman said &#8220;Chicken&#8221;. Well, a few minutes later, when it was the black man&rsquo;s turn to answer the fast money questons, he was also asked &#8220;What food would you bring to a picnic?&#8221; His answer? &#8220;Watermelon&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, people can complain all they want. But it is what it is.</p>

<p>  I have never understood understood the thing about fried chicken and watermelon being an affront to blacks. The love of thses two foods is not a black thing. If you ask 10 working class southern  whites for their three favorite food 8 out  10 will have have fried chicken and watermelon in thier top three. Its a Southern thing not a Black thing.</p>

<p>Big deal.  There was a place in Harlem (perhaps still is) named Kennedy Fried Chicken. I didn&rsquo;t hear of any complaints.</p>

<p>Yes, of course. Logic, reason, rationale, common sense and FACTS only apply to <b>CIVIL</b>izations.</p>
<p>(And as far as the ravioli goes   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s ALL in the sauce!)</p>

			<p>Ask Fuzzy Zoeller the golfer about &#8220;chicken&#8221; and certain ethnicities  being linked.  Remember?</p>
<p>The old double standard works well as long as it benefits the one who was previously the minority.</p>
<p>Certain ethnic groups have little ability for equal judgement, or logical evaluation.</p>

Excellent observation. I&rsquo;ve been thinking this myself   &mdash;   specifically with regard to whites&rsquo; coming minority status. This, to me, is the major fallacy of multiracialism: it&rsquo;s incumbent on whichever group happens to have the upper hand possessing the same strong dedication to fairness and equality and empathy for others that whites have. </p>
<p>AmRen&rsquo;s news items demonstrate on a daily basis that the darker races unquestionably DO NOT possess those qualities at the same levels as we do. This single, simple fact has ENORMOUS implications for white people everywhere. </p>
<p>Liberal whites today believe that if and when whites pass into minority status, we will be treated just as well as we&rsquo;ve treated others lately. AmRen readers know they will not   &mdash;   and not even necessarily because they&rsquo;re morally lacking, but because they&rsquo;re intellectually lacking and empathy and a dedication to justice are, to large degree, functions of intellect. What all this means in the long run is, with them in charge, even if blacks and browns don&rsquo;t MEAN us harm, they will nevertheless still end up CAUSING us harm   &mdash;   because they aren&rsquo;t smart enough not to. </p>
<p>This is why we CAN&rsquo;T let them minoritize us, and MUST turn around our dwindling numbers before D-Day 2042.</p>
<p>(Sorry if this is going a little off the original topic of fried chicken and watermelon   &mdash;   both of which this Northern white boy likes a whole lot   &mdash;   but the previous poster&rsquo;s thoughtful observation gave rise to extrapolations on the theme.) </p>

			<p>If the owners of the chicken place had been white it probably would have been torn down by an angry mob by now. Anyone remember Sambo&rsquo;s restaurants? They were all taken over by Denny&rsquo;s who they greatly resembled since the name &#8220;Sambo&#8221; was considered an insult to blacks. </p>

			<p>What isn&rsquo;t an insult to blacks nowadays?</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s some serious money to be made in playing the victim.  More of the &#8220;give me that&#8221; mentality.</p>

			<p> With all the treason,dumbing down and economic problems,we are at least getting some comic relief.I guess a used car lot called Obama motors would work better with the GM bailout.They should have waited for the fastfood bailout before naming the chicken joint.</p>
