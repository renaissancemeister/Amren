				Video of an Attack on a White Man Infuriates the French

				<i>AR Staff, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> April 13, 2009</i>
			</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				The French Internet scene has been buzzing for a week over a surveillance video on a bus that caught four hoodlums beating up a young white Frenchman. The attackers appear to be dark-skinned immigrants, and can be heard calling the Frenchman such things as &#8220;French shit,&#8221; and &#8220;son of a whore.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				For a time there was suspicion about the authenticity of the video, but all doubts were laid to rest when a policeman in the Essone district admitted he had posted it. &#8220;I put it up to show a few friends the conditions under which we have to work, but it leaked,&#8221; he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				When surveillance videos are transferred to the police they are put under seal and are considered confidential material to be used in investigations. This officer in this case has been suspended pending an investigation. French authorities have forced all the French sites that had posted the video to take it down, and most of the few remaining copies are on Russian sites. A copy is available <a href="/videos/20081206bus_attack/index.html" target="video" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><u><big>here.</big></u></b></a>
			</p>
			<p>
				[The victim is in the foreground wearing a scarf. The other man who is beaten is the one who tried to help him.]
			</p>
			<p>
				After lying low for a week, the victim of the attack emerged to give an interview, which appeared on April 11 in the paper <cite>Le Figaro.</cite> The interview, printed below, shows that Frenchmen can be just as denatured as Americans. The reader comments on the article, however, show that just as in the United States, ordinary citizens are of an entirely different mind from their rulers and media spokesmen.

				<a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/04/10/01016-20090410ARTFIG00681-la-victime-agressee-dans-le-bus-temoigne-.php " target="figaro" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>The Victim of the Bus Attack Speaks</b></a>
				<p>
					Exclusive interview: The victim explains how he survived the attack and the recent publicity it has received.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interview by Christophe Cornevin, Le Figaro, April 10, 2009.
				</p>
				<p>
					Very poised, age 19, and a first-year student at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, F.G. has not forgotten anything about the attack of the night of December 6/7: Singled out on the Noctilien bus in Paris, he was beaten by four thugs. The incident was filmed by a surveillance camera and posted on the Internet, where it unleashed much controversy. A policeman, suspected of having put the film on line, has been suspended. F.G. recalls the events. In a cafe at a Paris railroad station, where he is waiting for the express train, he says he will speak &#8220;exclusively to Le Figaro, which found me first. After that, I will say no more. I want to move on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>What really happened on the Noctilien bus that night?
				</p>
				<p>
					I had spent the evening with friends and I was getting ready to go home to the 17th Arrondissement. I got on the Noctilien alone at the Gare de l&rsquo;Est railroad station. I turned my back on four young men. One of them asked for a cigarette while another went through my pockets. When I turned around, I saw one of them was opening my wallet. I instinctively tried to get it back. That&rsquo;s when things started .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>The very violent attack on you must have seemed interminable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a hard time judging what I went through in space and time. Watching the video let me see what the attack was really like. All I remember is that they pushed me toward the back of the bus and that I was knocked down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, I came back towards the conductor and was punched and kicked some more. As you can see in the video, other passengers were attacked, especially a young man who tried to help me.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>What about the driver, who remains seated?
				</p>
				<p>
					I don&rsquo;t hold anything against him. It was very hard for him to react. He did what he could according to the rules: He stopped right away and called the police. They arrested two people on the spot, and their alleged accomplices were caught a few days later.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>Internet sites say that racial slurs were shouted at you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn&rsquo;t hear anything like that. If such things were said it would have been in the context of my attackers being drunk or on drugs. In any case, they were not all immigrants. The video of my attack looks like a stereotype because I was dressed conservatively and was faced by four people who were making a lot of noise. I do not want at all to be considered an example of a certain social image of someone singled out by foreigners. I didn&rsquo;t take it that way. In any case, one of the attackers, who was shaved and wearing a sweat suit, was of a very pale color.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>What did you come away with after that trauma?
				</p>
				<p>
					Nothing has been found besides bruises and a hematoma in one eye. Two days later I went to a psychiatrist at the Hotel-Dieu hospital in Paris who told me I seemed to be getting over it fine. Since then, I started taking public transportation again, even the Noctilien line .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>But this episode came back like a boomerang because of the Internet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes. On April 6, a friend told me that a video had been posted on Facebook. When I saw the link, I was going to tell the person who has posted it to take it down. I had no idea it had been disseminated on such a scale .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Figaro: </b>It seems that this posting bothers you as much as the attack itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The situation is very difficult, very delicate. Many of my friends have been shocked by the way the video got around and the trouble it has caused me. Putting images like this on the Internet is serious because it calls into question some of our judicial principles. There is a big difference between what actually happened and the way it has been presented. This video has circulated on extremist sites and has been exploited by political types.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, I don&rsquo;t want to be used. The subject suits certain radical ideas and I don&rsquo;t want to put fuel on the fire. I had to escape from this simple-minded caricature. It is never pleasant suddenly to appear in the middle of a firestorm. It hurts me a great deal, just when I had managed to get over the facts themselves. I am leaving Paris in order to get some peace and be with family.
				</p>

			Just two days after this article appeared on the Figaro website, it had attracted more than 750 comments. The vast majority expressed frustration and even anger at the way the young man appears to excuse the attack and play down the racial angle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typical comments:
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Halleluiah! I was worried France had a race problem.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;I&rsquo;m a miserable little petit bourgeois white man, responsible for all the evils of the world and I got just what I deserved.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Without the Internet this would never have been known. Whenever it&rsquo;s a white who is attacked, the media go silent.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Next time this young man will be knifed. All he is doing is encouraging more violence.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;When I read the feeble reaction of this victim to that attack I can think only one thing: He took too many blows to the head and has lost all sense of reality.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;This interview is nothing more than an attempt to by the media to calm the sheep that we have become.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;He could have been killed, but he seems to have learned nothing!&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;This is what you get after 20 years of just one point of view, of obsessive anti-racism, and of denying reality. Disturbing. Surrealist.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;This attack on the bus is nothing compared to what happened to Delphine, a young woman who was raped for months by some 30 swine from North Africa.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;If he&rsquo;s trying to quiet the buzz, his idiot interview hasn&rsquo;t worked.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;The words of this young man show wisdom and intelligence well beyond his years. Bravo.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Grow some balls, like the kid who tried to help him. That&rsquo;s what we need, not more loudmouths.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;He&rsquo;ll end up as a minister in someone&rsquo;s government! He has already mastered the finer points of mealy-mouthed political correctness.&#8221;<br />

					There is no doubt that cameras being placed everywhere and algore&rsquo;s wonderful invention, the internet, will show reality to the world. There needs to be a web site dedicted solely to video of minorities assaulting whites. There has to be tons of this type film around the world. A site where one could anonymously send in video of these attacks. It would be a major plus for our cause. A picture says a thousand words and a video says a million words.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice how the cop is made to be the bad guy in the story for showing this assault video. The french &#8220;authorities&#8221; no doubt will set him up as an example of what will happen to you if you show those wonderful, lovable minorities in a bad light. WHat a bunch of milksops.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the young man who was attacked and his feeble response? What can you expect from a person who has been taught that whitey is the cause of all the worlds problems and minorities are his hapless victims. And if a minority does lash out? It is only an understandable response to years and years of white oppression of these poor minorities.

					If this man can&rsquo;t see the reality of what happened, at least those who viewed the video did. That&rsquo;s one against us and 750 on our side.

					Yes, appropriately, as standard operating procedure in any government that is made up of mentally disturbed leftists, it is vitally important that the truth never gets out if it reveals any kind of flaw within their diversity perversions.
				</p>
				<p>
					How these poor government fools ever bought into the idea that they needed third world rabble to bolster their societies economically is evidence of their extreme gullibility and naivete.
				</p>
				<p>
					But, as in Nurenburg, &#8220;just doing one&rsquo;s job&#8221; is no excuse for criminal government conduct, and these videos and written records will be invaluable when these government stooges are put on trial after these multicultural paradises collapse, as it appears they will, unless a miracle happens.

					What a pathetic, brain-washed liberal. One would think a beating like that would &#8216;knock&rsquo; some sense into him.
				</p>
				<p>
					A serious question - What would it take to make someone like this to finally see the light? When will people like this learn and how do you separate them from the leftist ideals of their parents and peers?
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I feel that Whites need to get their children out of the hands of government educators, and teach their children how to stand up and defend themselves. This guy is so conditioned that he didn&rsquo;t even have the foresight to flee when he had the chance, not to mention leaving his back to them. (Yes, fleeing is an option when it&rsquo;s 4 to 1)
				</p>
				<p>
					At least some of the comments posted on the Le Figaro website are encouraging. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be forced to delete most of the AMREN-friendly ones before too long.

					What I find even more disturbing than the attack itself was how much of a coward the victim appears to be. He appeared to just lay down and die. <br />
					He let a punk much smaller than him throw several unanswered hits. <br />
					If that had been me, the punk wearing the white hooded jacket would&rsquo;ve had his blood all over it. The others would&rsquo;ve thought twice about joining in.<br />
					I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the police ended up arresting ME!

					One of the bloggers on another site said that it happened so quick,he takes no blame because he couldn`t see it coming. I replied he sure wasn`t looking hard enough. I would have seen the makeup AND behavior of other riders on the bus and reacted accordingly. TO wit: Not turned my back on them, and quickly taken my scarf from around my neck and wrapped it around my hand. Then I would have found a rudimetry weapon in my pocket and bought it into &#8220;Position B.&#8221; Well I guess that`s enough for one lesson&hellip;

					Sadly reminiscent of attacks by blacks on Whites on public transportation in the U.S. Also his spineless attitude about the attack is disgustingly similar to that of some Whites in this country who have been victims of those attacks. Notice how two of the thugs appear to be exchanging &#8220;gang identification&#8221; signals just before the attack begins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Would that there had been someone on that bus with a 9-millimeter Glock, or something similar, who wasn&rsquo;t afraid to use it to help a fellow Frenchman who was being beaten like a punching bag. Wonder if the National Rifle Association has a chapter in Paris?

				</p>
				<p>
					Well, that explains everything. He&rsquo;s training to be a politician&hellip;or a political lackey. No surprise that he&rsquo;s all &#8220;politically correct&#8221; about this. He&rsquo;s endured a beating now in hopes of making a lot more money later. He ultimately wants to be a part of the &#8220;ruling elite&#8221; that tells the rest of us how to think. No doubt, though, that when it comes to choosing a neighborhood in which to live in the future, he&rsquo;ll choose the whitest one he can afford.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>If such things were said [racial slurs] it would have been in the context of my attackers being drunk or on drugs.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Amazing! He&rsquo;s a mind reader too! Of course no such rationalizations if it were a white attack on blacks (almost unthinkable) or a &#8220;racist&#8221; incident by whites.

					===================================
				</p>
				<p>
					I&rsquo;d be cvery curious just WHAT trouble has the video caused him? He&rsquo;s more upset about the video, while he&rsquo;s practically dismissing the attack!
				</p>
				<p>
					And what is the difference between &#8220;the way it actually happened&#8221; and the way it&rsquo;s seen? Has the video been doctored? Is it lying to us?
				</p>
				<p>
					He&rsquo;s also worried about calling into question some of France&rsquo;s judicial principles. Absurd! Maybe those principles NEED to be questioned! Maybe they&rsquo;re part of the reason why this happened.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously, this &#8220;nice&#8221;, &#8220;educated&#8221;, well-bred young man has been thoroughly brainwashed by all his excess of education, his upbringing, and by the ubiquitious media. He&rsquo;s still parroting the official line that he&rsquo;s been taught &mdash; probably all he knows. Well, he&rsquo;s only 19, poor kid. He&rsquo;s got a lot yet to learn. Maybe a few more incidents like this by the time he&rsquo;s 30 and he&rsquo;ll wise up. If he survives them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Btw, I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of scenes like this &mdash; just wihout coming to that level of violence. The scene is a very typical one. On many a late bus, subway, or suburban train, you may be the only white in sight. He was like bait in front of a pack of barracudas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and did you see those other passengers? Timid! Docile! That&rsquo;s typical too. Except for a couple, all wanted nothing to do with the situation and fled the scene or cowered like helpless sheep while one of their own was being devoured. You can&rsquo;t count on anyone helping you. If they had all stood together, nothing like this could happen. The brazen, swaggering immigrant thugs know they have the advantage because no one will face them. They know they are dealing with a herd of frightened sheep who are all just looking out for themselves. Shameful!

I could have wiped the floor with these guys. Those men just stood there and took it, while others watched. Where are the police? This was a shameful display in so many ways. Europe will be lost to the muslim.

					I&rsquo;m surprised that anyone helped at all. Most Whites are content with watching their society collapse right before their eyes. There are numerous videos circulating the web of Blacks and other minorities beating the daylights out of a helpless White person while other able bodied White people stand around and twiddle their thumbs. This video of the 300 pound Black guy breaking the face of some poor White person in the pizza parlor comes to mind:

					A couple of weeks ago on this site I posted a graphic video of a similar incident that occured here in Melbourne on a Australian based story.
				</p>
				<p>
					I check my local news site most days and yet I had never heard of this particular incident though it was more news worthy than most stories I see covered locally. <br />
					I found out about it by accident when I was googling something else about &#8216;cctv footage at train stations&rsquo;.<br />
					<br />
					Now today I&rsquo;ve back to the original source article at<br />
					https://www.livenews.com.au/Article/Index/187514?channel=home<br />
					And the video footage is gone.<br />
					(Comments posted are similar to those quoted in this article).

					i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right for the people commenting on the story on le figaro&rsquo;s website to insult the guy like that, he has a right to think whatever he wants about immigrants. he could stand to be a little more angry though. this definitely isn&rsquo;t the first attack on white man by immigrant youths. also if he did express any anger towards immigrants he would end up in jail and not those thugs who attacked him.

					What I don&rsquo;t get is the victim&rsquo;s dismissing the racial slurs as the result of the assailants being drunk or high. The Romans had a phrase, In Vino Veritas. Their being drunk or high (if they even were) only means their racism is more credible. This attack sounded so organized that I doubt they were drunk or high.

					A few years ago I was taking the subway home in New York when an African-&#8220;American&#8221; man pushed past me on the subway and, after determining that I had not excused him enough, smacked the book I was reading out of my hand and threatened me, all the while ranting and raving about how sick he was of being treated rudely etc. A nearby Black woman said, &#8220;Ooooh, they&rsquo;s fightin&rsquo; (like the Jena Six case, that counts as a fight). I was lucky that there was no serious violence or injury, but I didn&rsquo;t bother calling the police or anything. One of the first things I did when I got home: subscribe to American Renaissance.

					Personally while I do not condone such atrocious behavior, the fact is that many europeans are arrogant, nasty and bullish toward many of us immigrants.
				</p>
				<p>
					I myself have been the victim of hostile, disrespectful behavior from native europeans, mostly men, since i lived here. I get condescending looks from some people whenever I walk into a pub, local gym, grocery stand, biblioteche etc&hellip; Many people are kind and helpful, but there are a few that are overtly mean.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last year, an asian frind of mine and I were walking home when were soon followed by four big, tall White european males making anti-immigrant remarks. At times they would whisper among themselves. Two of the guys threatened to throw us into the local river and bragged that no one would ever find us and that they would be able to get way with it. Given the fact that my frined and I are small guys and these we were huge men we were scared for our lives. We were afraid that they would eventually turn violent.
				</p>
				<p>
					They followed us for at least twenty minutes, we quickened our pace without running. Afterwards, thy made some nasty xenophobic remarks and retreated the other way. My friend and I were relieved. Another Arab friend of mine was hit in the head with a brick by a driver in a car. The driver threw the brick from his car and immediately drove off. My friend suffered minor injuries from the incident. The driver has yet to be caught.
				</p>
				<p>
					But my earlier point was that we as immigrants are under constant assualt and disrepsectful behavior from other europeans and many of us are getting tired and frustrated of being treated like we are nothing. It has to stop!

					I would like to know one thing from the posters here:

				<p>
					Muslims make these claims how they invented 1000<br />

					even true or is it just propaganda??

					I get the suspicion that they have plagiarized most<br />
					of the mechanical inventions of Greeks and Romans<br />
					and are claiming it as &#8220;Islamic&#8221;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check-out wikipedia by the way.

				<p>
					It is a bit surprising and even incomprehensible<br />
					how a bunch of Desert dwelling nomads suddenly, <br />
					as if overnight changed into Scientists and inventors<br />
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can anybody on here verify this? I think it is <br />
					important that we confront this claim of &#8220;Muslim<br />
					inventiveness&#8221; if we want to keep these people out<br />
					our countries. Already, Muslims are claiming that<br />
					the US is based on Judeo/Christian and God Forbid<br />
					ISLAMIC FOUNDATIONS???<br />

					I noticed that a lot of posters are really bashing the poor kid for being a &#8220;wimp&#8221;.Yes,I do agree, he is a wimp,that&rsquo;s very true.He has been well trained from birth, to be a &#8220;wimp&#8221; and not stand up and fight.I blame the liberal government,the schools,his own parents are at fault.He has been physcologically conditioned to feel and act inferior,to be afraid,of the more aggressive races of the world. However I have a slightly different theory on why he reacted the way he did to the Internet video.I believe it&rsquo;s just plain old &#8220;fear&#8221;.He knows that all the publicity from this will just make him a bigger target.They will be out to get him, make no mistake about it.Other thug punks will look at him as a sort of &#8220;trophy&#8221; if you will.Do you see what I&rsquo;m saying? He knows it was racially motivated,but if he pushes the race issue he&rsquo;s doomed and he knows it.The media will turn on him,calling him a racist,etc.Even his family will then become targets.The police won&rsquo;t protect him.I for one feel sorry for this young man.I hope eventually he does become stronger and tougher because of this.He&rsquo;s just one more victim of this screwed up politically correct world that he must deal with every day of his young life.&#8221;We the people&#8221; allowed this to happen.All of our children are in danger of the same thing happening to them.It really validates what I always say&hellip;Teach your children well&hellip;&hellip;..

					This young man will go home, quietly continue his studies, and every time he sees the PC anti-white claptrap, his guts will respond and remind him of what has happened. He has not only been robbed and beaten up, he has been publicly humiliated because the video got around the internet. These things have a way of forging a man&rsquo;s character even if he doesn&rsquo;t want it to happen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice how small the little goon that started everything was. The only one who was a real physical threat to the young white man was the taller black with the bleached hair who comes in halfway through. Arabs are physically weak and not very agile. Blacks are a threat one on one but they can be cowardly. Whites need to look in the mirror and remember who they are and who their ancestors are.

					I was jumped in High School by blacks quite a few times. Eventually my parents tranfered me to another school. I was never a tough guy, however the blacks that jumped me had to be big as I fended off attacks by smaller blacks by swinging wildly under fire. I do not think one of those young men from the video could have hurt me with their fists. I am only 33. They seemed small and fragile from the video to be scaring a bus of passengers.

					How typical of &#8220;African Immigrant&#8221; to excuse violence by claiming Europeans &#8220;disrespect&#8221; immigrants. This is typical black behavior, always believing that being &#8220;disrespected&#8221; gives them the right to murder, rape, or violently assault a person. No wonder whites look down on you and think you&rsquo;re inferior, because you ARE.
				</p>
				<p>
					If anyone&rsquo;s disrespectful, it&rsquo;s you and your fellow immigrants for trashing Europe with your rampant criminality, barbaric behavior, and general nastiness towards the white population. You have no right to be in Europe, so go back to Africa where you belong!

					We should start calling liberals what this video proves they are: Self hating white boys. The time for being nice to these mealy mouth cretins is OVER. Being nice and saying things like &#8220;please&#8221;,&#8221;thank you&#8221;,and &#8220;I beg to differ&#8221; got us to exactly where we are today. We win by making the libs and thier non white pets fear and respect us. When they call you a name like &#8220;racist&#8221;,the worst thing to do is start denying and thereby putting yourself on the defensive. Always use the opportunity to call the lib another inflammatory name like &#8220;communist&rsquo;, &#8220;baby killer&#8221;, &#8220;child molester&#8221;,or &#8220;self hating white b h&#8221;. They are all true and calling them out throws them on the defensive for a change. Ask yourself: Are you going to let a bunch of weaklings like this steal everything you care about and wreck your civilization by the simple expedient of calling you the same old schoolyard slurs we&rsquo;ve been haering for at least 50 years now?

					I think the term &#8216;mealy mouth&rsquo; could be seen as offensive and demeaning. Using a phrase like this, as usual, is far more offensive than assault and even murder, by a non-white. Potential readers will be turned off by the phrase &#8216;mealy mouth&rsquo; more so than the assaults and beatings that take place when white folks don&rsquo;t properly show they know their place. Just my opinion. Frankly, I&rsquo;m more angry at the monitor who used the word mealy mouth than I am the assailants. At least the assailants didn&rsquo;t take time to think about what they were doing.

				</p>
				<p>
					A man who was beaten Monday night at the Federal Way Transit Center suffered serious injuries, and police are searching for his attackers.
				</p>
				<p>
					About 11:15 p.m., police said the victim approached a loud individual and asked him to lower his voice. A group of men approached from another area and one in the group struck the victim in the face.
				</p>
				<p>
					While they were fighting, another man from the group hit the victim in the face, causing him to fall.
				</p>
				<p>
					Officers said he suffered a broken jaw, broken facial bones and lost several teeth. He was in stable condition Wednesday evening at Harborview Medical Center.
				</p>
				<p>
					Police are following leads from the victim and a witness to find the suspects. A video from Transit Center surveillance cameras was reviewed by police.

					I hope many of you will get the point that in public, you need to be ready for violence. If confronted, you can do your best to avoid the situation but if there is impending violence (a person standing in your face and threatening you) don&rsquo;t be afraid to assume a boxers stance and insist that they stand back. If they swing on you hit back!! Move, don&rsquo;t cover up and let the attack continue until they get tired of beating on you. Fight back hard and make these guys get winded! Believe me, they will not go easy on you if you &#8220;duck and cover&#8221;. If faced with multiple opponents, think &#8220;hit and run&#8221; avoid their tackles with stiff arms etc. The bottom line is to fight and make these guys so tired that even if they try to beat you they&rsquo;ll be too tired to do a good job. I&rsquo;ve been in several multi attacker fights and I can assure you that if you don&rsquo;t fight back you will get FAR more messed up than if you do.

					The next ten or so years are also likely to be the last chance to see the real Europe, traditional Europe as it&rsquo;s always been. At least the remains of it. [And in ten years, with the collapsing dollar, Americans will be too impoverished anyway.] Massive changes are coming, just around the corner. A number of places, such as Brussels where I happen to be during Easter, are on the verge of &#8220;tipping&#8221;, and after that they will never be the same again. The Moslems and Africans are getting ready to take over, and they will be able to do so without firing a shot. Their victory will be achieved in the maternity ward, not the battle field. Their women, in a sense, are their warriors.

				<p>
					Yes, and do visit Moscow and Tokyo too, just to see the contrast. (I don&rsquo;t know about Warsaw, but from what I hear, from Poles, they&rsquo;re getting a lot of Arabs too.)<br />

					First off, I highly doubt you are an African at all, but let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of argument that you are from Africa. Let&rsquo;s assume that you emigrated from your native land to Europe, the above comments you made illustrate your lack of gratitude to your host country (again, you didn&rsquo;t specify which country).
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s interesting how you point out that Europeans (capitalize the &#8220;E&#8221; next time) are &#8220;arrogant, nasty, and bullish&#8221; and yet no one forced you to leave your country and settle in Europe! If Europeans are so nasty (read racists, apparently), why did you leave your African homeland? Why not be educated in South Africa and then go back to your respective country?
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s because you know that your people are backwards, incapable of building or sustaining a civilization! Of course you probably didn&rsquo;t like the fact that your country didn&rsquo;t have enough white women, short of the nun or homely UNICEF do-gooder.

					This is the problem. There is ALWAYS conflict when different races, language groups, or religions are forced to live together. In fact, the majority of past and current wars are due to diversity-fueled conflict. Once two groups live in the same place, there will be conflict forever, or one group will eliminate the other.

					No you don&rsquo;t! A nation is formed by a group of people of common, shared language, religion, culture, laws, work ethic, and morals. The main purpose of forming a nation is for the common welfare of the citizens of that nation. Nation&rsquo;s are not formed to &#8220;serve&#8221; people from other nations.

					I am very glad you have finally come to your senses. One can have a serious discussion about whethet or not a free market solution would be good option in certain situations. Howver, Ron Paul and his suporters are pushing an all encompassing world view that will result in the death of Native Born White America. Ron Paul supporters are pushing extreme anti-community individualism. Isolated and highly alienated Native Born White Americans whose only identity is their &#8220;rugged freemarket individualism&#8221; be picked off very rapidly until Native Born White Americans are at the mercy of a post-1965 non-whites.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is for this reason that what I see happening over at Taki magazine as not being a serious altetrnative to the fake-conservative Republican party.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his interview with Peter Brimelow over at vdare.com Ron Paul advocated increasing the H-1B and L-1 B visa programs. In other words, Ron Paul wants a massive increase in asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Taki.com has evolved into a full-blown Ron Paul cheerleading squad. It is not a coincidence, therefor, that Richard Spencer-Taki.com&rsquo;s editor-with the blessing of Taki, now has a notorious asian supremacist-Razib Kahn as a regular commenter on Taki.com.
				</p>
				<p>
					A White Nationalist movement is the only alternative to the Republican party. It is one minute before midnight for Native Born White Americans within the borders of America(actually two years before 2011 when the cCnsus Bureau -to the great joy of the Republican party and Barack Obama-annouces the inevitable minority racial status of Native Born White Americas. Only a strong uncompromising, highly interconnected and locally based-grass-roots White Nationalist political movement can reverse this.

					Factualist, I too have struggled with understanding why whites seem so individualist, while all other races stick to their own and back up their own.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have finally made peace with this apparent problem by a realization: whites are not exactly individualists. Our inner nature guides us to act as individual autonomous agents abiding by public standards of morality and behavior. That is what makes us so different from all other races.
				</p>
				<p>
					We whites are the only race on earth who have the innate capacity to live as Free Men. Not in the sense of destructive cheaters or freeloaders; in the sense of beings who become free through self-discipline and strict adherence to ideals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of the &#8220;isms&#8221; that have torn apart white society, and consider that no other race can be torn apart by &#8220;isms&#8221; or ideals of any kind. Liberalism, Feminism, Capitalism, Libertarianism&hellip; can you imagine blacks or browns living by &#8220;isms&#8221; of any kind? Other races can barely conceive of any ideal, and live by looking out for what they understand: those they personally know and close kin. These other races see whites as &#8220;suckers,&#8221; &#8220;fools,&#8221; and &#8220;naive&#8221; people because they have no inner capacity for idealism and self-sacrifice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whites have broader, higher horizons, and this has allowed us to create public spaces under the rule of universal laws. We have created the best societies in the world bar none because we have this in our nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					This idealism has become a weakness only because it has been &#8220;hijacked&#8221; and wrongly applied with no boundaries. The white liberals that we racialists criticize in truth are some of the highest specimens of our race. Their idealism is only misused against them, because they have been fed a distorted image of reality (a lie) of racial equality. The white capacity for delayed gratification has been misused to make our young people wait for marriage until they are past their best reproductive years (late teens and early 20&rsquo;s). Feminism has transformed white women with better minds than any other women in the world into careerists who neglect their own children.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. This white higher capacity for self-sacrifice and individual idealistic rule-abiding autonomy is our greatest inner asset. It only needs to be re-channeled according to what is correct and what is true and what conforms to nature, instead of allowing it to be used against us and taken advantage of by bad men and women.

					Sorry to double comment, just to sum up. White Liberals are not really selfish; they are self-sacrificing, idealistic people committed to the ideals they have been given. The problem is the poisonous ideals that have been fed to these basically superior, decent, high minded whites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any animal would react to defend itself more than the young white Frenchman in that bus. But he restrained himself, because his inner nature was guided by ideals he has been given. I hope this incident causes him to look inside himself and question those ideals, and to see that the Arab and black punks who attacked him are his natural inferiors in every way and should be recognized as such.

					Typically African. A white gets gang attacked because of his skin color and he lectures us on the supposed mistreatment of immigrants in France. Of course, immigrants in France get preferences in jobs, housing, education, health and welfare. They chose to come to France and are a preferred class. Violence against immigrants by whites is mostly non-existent and pales to the violence committed by African immigrants.

					African Immigrant is a perfect example of the type of specimen France has let in. His hatred and envy of whites and lack of gratitude leads him to excuse any type of racist violence directed at the the true French people. France is paying the price for not listening to Le Pen.<br />

					I disagree with that. While I&rsquo;ve read many critiques of liberals from figures on the far-right, and Archy Bunker too, (activist minded liberals trying to infiltrate, embarrass, monitor and control the right), I would say the success of liberal ideology is simply founded upon it being the ideology with which it easiest to hurt other people. Right or wrong, it&rsquo;s success hinges upon nothing more, and nothing less. When they go on about the poor in Africa somewhere, the ones they are really concerned with are a lot closer to them than that. <br />

					You may have the legal right, due to some weak liberal at immigration, but not the moral right. The vast majority of whites in Europe object to immigration, particularly from Turkey, Pakistan &amp; Africa, as they bring nothing but problems. UK prisons are full of non-white criminals at a cost of £39,000 PA per prisoner. Muslim prisoners are the quickest growing group.

					A year of two ago, we had an interesting French poster, &#8220;Ethno-differentialiste&#8221; &hellip;. we no longer hear from him, but I found him very informative about certain fine points of history and local details. I recall him mentioning how the Arabs and Africans derisively and openly refer to the French as <i>&#8220;les petits français&#8221; </i> &mdash; the little Frenchies. They are openly contemptuous of the French people who are their hosts and benefactors.
				</p>
				<p>
					And about a year ago, here on Amren, we saw videos of those same Africans and Arabs gratuitously attacking white university students in the street &mdash; not just attacking the French boys, but even the girls! The well behaved, well dressed French students made easy pickings; they didn&rsquo;t fight back. (Just like this young man in the video.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Several years ago in Marseilles, I was myself approached in the street by some &#8220;youths&#8221;, EXACTLY like those in this video. This occurred in the center of busy downtown Marseilles, in the financial district just a couple of blocks from the stock exchange, and in mid-afternoon, with people all around. As in the video, they first asked for a cigarette, then attempted to engage me in some harmless chitchat (which instantly revealed to them that I was American). Next thing, they suddenly tried to trip me from behind while someone grabbed for my shoulder bag. Although I&rsquo;m a good deal older than these punks were, I immediately put up my fists and assumed a fighting stance, warning them off. I think I said something like, &#8220;Get away from me, you goddamn garbage!&#8221; They were shocked. They were plainly unprepared for such an unsubmissive response and my willingness to give them a fight. Perhaps they were also disconcerted by the discovery that I was American and not &#8220;un petit français&#8221; (a little Frenchie). At any rate, they backed off, cursing me, and disappeared into the crowd. (No one had offered any help.)
				</p>
				<p>
					I have to laugh now when I recall the startled looks on their faces. They weren&rsquo;t expecting any resistance. But also I wonder now, in hindsight, what would have come of it if the police had gotten involved. Could I have been charged with ethnic incitement? Hate speech? I wonder if what they might have DONE to me would have less serious than what I SAID to them. Perhaps if these harmless, innocent &#8220;youths&#8221; had put a knife between my ribs that would have been merely a pardonable offense, understandable with all the oppression they have endured. But if I were charged with calling them &#8220;racaille&#8221; (trash) would that have been a major crime?

					For the die hard liberals, that is true. They are venom filled people who fear and hate mainstream culture. But these liberal hatemongers would have no clout were it not for naive, idealistic and intelligent college students who are convinced by their arguments out of a sense of self-sacrifice. There is a big psychological difference between the crucifiers and the crucified.

					The crucified idealistic youth who vote for Obama, many of these are fine young people who are being used. They are some of our finest: the smartest, the best educated, from the most accomplished families. Too many of these superior youth are being led to sacrifice their own culture instead of to sacrifice FOR their own culture.

					Taxi drivers are attacked so frequently in Denmark many now simply refuse to serve certain areas. They can take the bus instead, if and when the bus drivers aren&rsquo;t on strike for the same reasons.

				<p>
					In a far more benign incident, a Turk repeatedly threatened to beat me up in a tightly packed tube (subway) for no reason in particular a couple of years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I was trying to defuse the situation to seemingly little avail, an elderly woman (of all people!) eventually mustered the courage to tell him it was enough, prompting him to loudly inform the entire wagon that all we ******* Germans stink&hellip; but he fortunately backed down eventually (he was by himself, after all&hellip;).
				</p>
				<p>
					Now this wouldn&rsquo;t even be worthy of mention if similar incidents didn&rsquo;t happen with such incredible frequency.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					We change sidewalks, avoid eye-contact and take the usual verbal and sometimes physical abuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Europe - make that the West- has become a total nuthouse.
				</p>
				<p>
					And what do our politicians have to say?
				</p>
				<p>
					Chancellor Merkel thinks we need all their &#8220;talents&#8221; (Just what, exactly, would those be? I guess one can be a talented trickthieve). <br />
					President Köhler calls them our &#8220;dear loved ones&#8221; (unsere Schätze).
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe they should actually live side by side with their talented dear loved ones for a while. What&rsquo;s holding them back?
				</p>
				<p>
					Absolutely surreal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the CIA has predicted no less than the collapse (!) of Europe by 2020 according to Mark Steyn. <br />
					(Finally, someone even more pessimistic than myself. My estimate is a situation akin to civil war by 2030)
				</p>
				<p>
					With those problems and these politicians, I see a lot of trouble on the horizon.
				</p>

					African Immigrant can claim he&rsquo;s against violence all he wants. The facts speak otherwise. If he truly were against this brutal attack, he would have posted something along the lines of &#8220;I am disgusted by this crime, and there is no excuse whatsoever for what the criminals did.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					No, the fact that he immediately lectures us on the supposed &#8220;hostility&#8221; of Europeans speaks volumes. Blacks do this all the time. When one of their own commits a heinous crime, instead of shunning the criminal, they start whining about &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;poverty,&#8221; &#8220;disrespect,&#8221; etc. They never miss the opportunity to shift some (or all) of the blame onto the victim, especially when the victim is white.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe African Immigrant is a troll. Maybe he&rsquo;s not. I am not concerned about him, as anyone with an IQ over 100 can read his words and see how immoral he is. What concerns me is the sheer number of brainwashed whites who honestly believe this Marxist propaganda. The 19-year-old has proven that some whites are so mentally ill that they are beyond hope.

					Some bloggers have commented on the distant, indifferent, apparently callous attitude exhibited by the driver. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t his job to get involved in things like that and it is forbidden by union rules anyway. That said, there is another point no one else seems to have picked up on. I would take the driver to be an Arab himself. He looked it, and many bus drivers are. Therefore, given the intensity of racial/ethnic feeling on one side at least (even if the other side does not know it or refuses to acknowledge it), there is no telling what his private feelings were. He could have been sympathetic to their side and resented &#8220;Frenchy&#8221; just as much as they did. This is what happens when you have a diverse society. You don&rsquo;t know whom to trust, and no one will help you.
				</p>
				<p>
					But one further observation is necessary: the young man made absolutely no attempt to help himself! He never even TRIED to fight back! He was as helpless as a lamb in the abattoir. In fact, he was a good deal larger than the little brown shrimp in the hood (the one who kept beating him the most and was enjoying it). Except for the big Black, the other two Arabs were pretty scrawny specimens as well, as most of them usually are. And they were only amateur thugs at that. If he had any kind of training in self-defense, he could have mopped the floor with three of them. And the big Black, despite his size, was probably just an amateur too and would have gone running at the startling sight of a defiant Frenchman who could hold his own. &mdash; https://tinyurl.com/c3cb96

The thing is, when we have the converse situation, of non-Whites attacking Whites, it is not held up as an example of anti-White racism. Rather, the racial issue is conveniently swept under the rug. What is of concern to many Whites is that they are being relegated to the status of second class citizens in their own countries. A non-White immigrant who comes under attack can claim the status a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; victim; a White who comes under attack is denigrated as a member of a &#8220;privileged&#8221; group.

					I agree with M.M. that noone will support this guy. Noone stood up to help him during his attack. I am a white woman who suffered a slapping attack by a black woman 2 times my size in a public place and noone helped me either. Whites are the only people I know who deny there is such a thing as race and until they do they can expect to see more of this behavior.

					I think (I hope) that it&rsquo;s useful to take what we learn here and post it on ordinary media. It took me a year or two of being here before I felt ready to do that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think it&rsquo;s especially a good idea when we can post links to amren articles, or to articles on some other good white site. I figure anyone at the MSM site I post at (knoxnews.com) is going to learn a lot more than I can teach them if can just get them interested in hanging out here by continually leading them to good articles here.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel this video that Peter K linked for us is a special treasure in our hands &mdash; but I read that youtube often removes such videos after awhile &mdash; I hope we will be able to track it down elsewhere if that happens &mdash; I&rsquo;m not good at computer stuff, so I&rsquo;m sort of asking beforehand for help when/if that happens:

				</p>
				<p>
					If anyone wants to check out the style I&rsquo;ve developed where I post, and how I&rsquo;ve tried to get this particular video firmly into a thread there (sometimes the paper removes all my posts and bans me &mdash; so I take a new username and start over &mdash; and other days it leaves all my posts up), check out the first 9 or 10 posts, starting with the 3rd one, at:

				</p>
				<p>
					If amren thinks it suitable, it might be useful for those of us who are posting somewhere on the MSM to start exchanging a little info now and then about what we&rsquo;re doing and where we&rsquo;re doing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doing it is a challenge, because our posts get removed and we get regularly reviled, but it can also be very satisfying.

					The young male (I will not call him a man) in the video was simply adhering to the modern effeminate code of ethics that rejects all forms of self defense and violence as completely unacceptable, Neanderthal-like behavior. Cloaked from birth in a milksop security blanket, such males are ill-equipped to deal with immigrants from nations where aggression has not been bred out of the population.
				</p>
				<p>
					His reaction was not unusual; we have seen similar results in the &#8220;Happy Slapping&#8221; cases that occurred some time back. People would be randomly assaulted with a hearty slap in the face, and cower back in shocked fear.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was fortunate enough have grown up in a more aggressive rural environment and time here in the USA, so on travels overseas I have been able to unhesitatingly deal with the aggression of the natives in kind. Unfortunately, I have seen many of my colleagues shrink away from even the most trivial of confrontation. Sadly, such behavior amongst Westerners is widespread enough to have spawned the stereotype that we are all weak and unable to resist physical aggression.
				</p>
				<p>
					Western men had better start standing up for themselves and displaying courage and honor to the immigrant hordes, or they will so embolden the aggressors that soon no one will be safe from attack.

					Ha! Bad day for me to have linked my activities at knoxnews.com &mdash; a poster there has taken me as her special project and mobilized enough other posters to flag my posts, and every post of mine was removed (they leave the skeleton of a post when they remove it).

					Their paper, the Knoxville News Sentinel, is the source of almost all the amren articles on the Christian/Newsom torture/murder, which is what drew me there about a year ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main trials in that case will be starting up this summer, I believe in July.

					To Visine:

				<p>
					You couldn&rsquo;t be more correct. Another poster here on this thread already said there are plenty of videos available where whites are victimized by blacks&hellip;in the presence of other whites!
				</p>
				<p>
					I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but there will come a time when failing to act in each other&rsquo;s benefit will no longer be tenable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, I think the only thing that might ultimately motivate white people to act in unison will be a deterioration of society (as we know it) to such a low level that by that time the problem will no longer be solvable.

					I had gone to that site and read H. Dumpty&rsquo;s very mind, very reasonable posts. They were anything but &#8220;extreme&#8221;. In response to them, someone posted the comment that, <i>&#8220;I see the haters are out tonight.&#8221;</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					This was astonishing to me, considering that Mr. Dumpty&rsquo;s very calm, dispassionate posts had made NO personal statements, offered No personal opinions of any kind, but had simply quoted proven facts and sources and offered further links for their verification. I found no &#8220;hate&#8221; anywhere in them, just statements of fact.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not good enough! Apparently, even quoting verifiable facts is considered &#8220;hate&#8221; when the information is something that somebody else doesn&rsquo;t like and doesn&rsquo;t want to see printed.
				</p>
				<p>
					So this is what we have come to! This is the MSM! Even the truth is unallowable and has to be suppressed when somebody doesn&rsquo;t like it and feels &#8220;offended&#8221;.

					These were the Europeans who once went out and conquered the world &hellip; (of course considered a crime in today&rsquo;s Marxist analysis of history.)

					Today&rsquo;s pacifist Europeans, brought up in their socialist cocoon, have been wimpified, emasculated. This young man is a perfect example. They can no longer stand up for themselves.

They are now sitting ducks for any aggressive third worlders who wish to come in, abuse them, rob them, beat them, rape their women, and take over their countries.<br />

					There was an eeriely similar situation on &#8220;The Cougar&#8221; last night. I`m talking about the show of younger men dating an older woman. One guy who I`ll call The Frenchman serenaded the girl with a song. And it kind of worked. He also had that happy go lucky geek look about him. Another more testorone filled male became intoxicated and started taunting him and getting verbally agressive out of jealousy. The Frenchman/Troubador told the camera that the first guy was drunk and not worth talking to. But he quickly went to the other side of the room in a show of fear and not just disgust. When the Frenchman found out his adversary was chosen for next week also, the look of anxiety on his face was MORE than percerptable. He knew and the audience did too that he would have to face the situation and it was obvious he had no plan other than to cower out of the way. All from just tough in your face talk and nothing more&hellip;

					First: in Italy a girl was gang raped by (illegal) aliens. Days later she burst out and claimed she&rsquo;d kill them. Mysteriously she was compelled to apologize later saying she didn&rsquo;t mean it, blahblah.<br />
					So: either the victim is the stereotypical hippie garbed, well-meaning leftist who won&rsquo;t march to stop global warming tomorrow because it&rsquo;s &#8220;stop racism on campus day&#8221; OR pressure is applied on victims to endorse the meek, sympathetic mainstream explanation that (illegal) aliens just cannot be &#8220;bad&#8221;&hellip;there must be another reason, such as reaction to white hate, drugs etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second: Imagine the victim is sort of Steven Seagal (in his best days ) and manages to kill or brutally injure the attackers: he&rsquo;ll be spending time in jail and get the longest sentence for &#8220;excess&#8221;, while compassionate lefty activists visit his aggressors and outraged, servile politicians ask for more &#8220;hate laws&#8221; (that are never mentioned if victims are mainstream whites ). No joke: I read a document from a famous self-defense instructor who warned using martial arts to defeat (and injure) attackers may very well land one in jail.

					Personally while I do not condone such atrocious behavior, the fact is that many europeans are arrogant, nasty and bullish toward many of us immigrants.
				</p>
				<p>
					I myself have been the victim of hostile, disrespectful behavior from native europeans, mostly men, since i lived here. I get condescending looks from some people whenever I walk into a pub, local gym, grocery stand, biblioteche etc&hellip; Many people are kind and helpful, but there are a few that are overtly mean.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last year, an asian frind of mine and I were walking home when were soon followed by four big, tall White european males making anti-immigrant remarks. At times they would whisper among themselves. Two of the guys threatened to throw us into the local river and bragged that no one would ever find us and that they would be able to get way with it. Given the fact that my frined and I are small guys and these we were huge men we were scared for our lives. We were afraid that they would eventually turn violent.
				</p>
				<p>
					They followed us for at least twenty minutes, we quickened our pace without running. Afterwards, thy made some nasty xenophobic remarks and retreated the other way. My friend and I were relieved. Another Arab friend of mine was hit in the head with a brick by a driver in a car. The driver threw the brick from his car and immediately drove off. My friend suffered minor injuries from the incident. The driver has yet to be caught.
				</p>
				<p>
					But my earlier point was that we as immigrants are under constant assualt and disrepsectful behavior from other europeans and many of us are getting tired and frustrated of being treated like we are nothing. It has to stop!

					Incidents like these, whether committed by either side, are always regrettable, are deplorable, and are very sad. But this is what happens when defense of the homeland, one&rsquo;s own territory, <i>is left to the individual citizen. </i> It should not have to be that way&hellip; if our political representatives were doing their jobs. That is what we have governments for. They should relieve us of the necessity. This only happens when our so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; have abandoned us and betrayed our trust, leaving us as individuals to take our defense into our own hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, It should not have to be this way. And THAT is what is truly deplorable! We are the designated victims of population replacement, a utopian scheme conjured up by starry-eyed social engineers, greed-motivated capitalists, and race-motivated Marxists who do not have our interests at heart. Our rulers are &#8220;electing a new population&#8221;. Should we go submissively to our extinction simply because they have decided it? Is it any surprise that we should fight back - in any way that we can? It is unpleasant, but it is a necessity and our only resort. Our governments have betrayed us!
				</p>
				<p>
					We should not have to engage in these ugly personal confrontations. It shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. The immigrants should not have been allowed here in the first place. But, since they are here, we have every right to fight back to defend our interests, our families, our land, and our futures, since there is no one else doing it for us.

					Blacks expect a lot of grooming, high fiving, and social interactions that to whites feel is intrusive, excessive, and over the top. When whites treat blacks the same way whites treat each other, i.e. with reserve and dignity and allowing for personal space, blacks take it as a personal insult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks respond to this by ramping up their bad behavior to an even higher pitch to provoke a reaction from the whites they feel are unfairly &#8220;dissing&#8221; (ignoring) them. They are like bad, stupid children who have nothing positive to contribute to others so they act out and create scenes.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a pattern with blacks, not just in your face physical confrontation but the famous black &#8220;slip down&#8221; where grown men pretend they were pushed by the slightest brush. Then the lawsuit follows. It seems that blacks are unable to get anything in life without resorting to force or fraud.

					I DON&rsquo;T agree with Timothy/El Caudillo, although I will at least agree that it&rsquo;s good to hear all sides in a debate.
				</p>
				<p>
					But what is the other side? Where is the &#8220;debate&#8221; here? Talking about &#8220;dissing&#8221; and abuse of immigrants is deceptive and merely a sly distraction from the real issue: the abuse of Europeans in their homelands by violent invaders. The video was extremely clear and unambiguous. The white young Frenchman was not &#8220;abusing&#8221; anyone, so that argument is irrelevant. He was absolutely minding his own business when he was attacked by FOUR thugs. Four against one! He had done NOTHING to deserve this attack. He did not even respond to their violence, yet they continued beating him. HE was the victim, not THEY!
				</p>
				<p>
					Any talk about abuse of immigrants is just more black whining and excuse-making! It&rsquo;s a red herring meant to throw us off the topic and sidetrack the discussion away from the real issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					And as others have said, if abuse of immigrants in Europe is really so bad, they would be leaving in droves instead of pouring in by the millions. To the contrary, they are desperate to do ANYTHING to get into Europe somehow, by hook or by crook, legally or illegally. No matter what the &#8220;immigrants&rsquo; (ie.invaders) may say, they are voting with their feet.

					I agree with you. Whether you agree with him or not, African immigrant was civil and raised some valid points. Sad to say it is attitudes like Browswer (although that he/she is sincere in thir intentions)that contribute to the problems that the our movement faces.
				</p>
				<p>
					The July 2008 issue of American Renaissnce discusses this exact same point. I beleive that Paul Walker discussed how we cannot continue to be dismissive of others viewpoints and that a tone deaf attitude or being entirely dismissive toward dissenting viewpoints whether within or outside of the movement will be detrimental to our cause in the long run.

					&#8220;Based on the near-perfectly fluent American English in this posting, and the lack of any clear markers indicating what &ldquo;European&rdquo; city the person lives in, I am certain that the posting is a hoax. Sorry, trolls, we can see you a mile away.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					I agree. The post reminds me of those little scenes of evil whitey molesting innocent blacks we see on law and order and other anti white propaganda tv shows. I noticed a cop movie last night. 4 undercover cops working in what was obviously a black ghetto neighborhood. Suddenly they are held up by 2 white neo nazi types flourishing guns. The cops quickly disarmed and arrested the evil but comical whites. I switched channels. I refuse to watch those anti white shows.
				</p>
				<p>
					An old Sporanos re run last week showed some evil white boys ganging up on a poor, noble Somalian boy and stealing his bike. Unfortunately for David Chase&rsquo;s anti white propaganda, the Navy captain was still in the hands of Somalian pirates and it was all over the news channels.
				</p>
				<p>
					I watch a lot of true crime shows because they are better than the fiction crime shows. But I keep wondering. Why is the San Francisco Zebra killings along with the 271 other whites killed by black muslims in the same time period never shown? Why haven&rsquo;t we seen other black on white crime horror stories. Why no made for TV movie about the black muslim DC snipers?
				</p>
				<p>
					We all know the answers, it&rsquo;s the neo con control of media.<br />

					I too detect a troll. What country has both pubs (British) and biblioteche(French) I&rsquo;ve been to Europe many times and I have never seen the word grocery on any food store or stand. Europeans use whatever word means grocery in their own language.

					All I have to say, whether AI was legit or not, said poster raised his points politely and respectfully, which would be odd if the poster was indeed a &#8216;troll&rsquo;.

					For that matter, there is nothing wrong with discussing issues with those who may disagree with us. Agreeing/disagreeing should not be the primary focus.

					&#8220;I myself have been the victim of hostile, disrespectful behavior from native europeans, mostly men, since i lived here. I get condescending looks from some people whenever I walk into a pub, local gym, grocery stand, biblioteche etc&hellip; Many people are kind and helpful, but there are a few that are overtly mean.&#8221;<br />
					&mdash; African Immigrant
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, I&rsquo;ve got some shocking news for African Immigrant. There are people who are &#8220;mean and hostile&#8221; to other whites too! Not everybody loves us. Not even our own.
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine that!
				</p>
				<p>
					Does he have to interpret everything in terms of his race? What does he expect &mdash; everyone to welcome him with smiles and open arms? That doesn&rsquo;t happen to anybody, not even other whites. We encounter &#8220;overtly mean&#8221; and hostile people all the time in our daily lives. We don&rsquo;t consider it racial or see it as prejudice. African Immigrant may be &#8220;polite&#8221;, but I must say he&rsquo;s a little paranoid.

					Hank,
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks so much for the heads up on the Michael Walker article on the speech that he gave at the 2008 Amren conference!
				</p>
				<p>
					This was such an excellent read, that I forwarded a copy to everyone I know &mdash; and asked them to do the same!
				</p>
				<p>
					I think it should &mdash; nay must &mdash; be required reading for Amren members and anyone who wishes to post on this site.

					Hank,<br />
					<br />
					Just wanted to thank you for the heads up on the Michael Walker speech {&#8220;What Can I Do&#8221;} at the 2008 Amren Conference that you alluded to in your last post.<br />
					<br />
					This speech is simply EXCELLENT!<br />
					<br />
					It is so good in fact, that I forwarded a copy to everyone I know, and asked them all to do the same.<br />

					This should &mdash; nay must &mdash; be required reading for Amren members and all others wishing to contribute positively &mdash; and meaningfully &mdash; to our cause.<br />

				<p>
					No problem. I agree Michael Walker was definitely on to something. Hopefully it will be read by some of our posters who seem to think that intolerance, paranoia, refusing to look at an opposing viewpoint and that all others who are non-White are should be dismissed or not have any sympathy demonstrated toward them reconsider their draconian mindset.

					Our future as a race depends on it.
