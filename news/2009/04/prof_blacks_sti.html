<h1>Prof: Blacks Still Second-Class</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mariam Khan, The Lantern (Ohio State University), April 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The central issue facing civil rights activists today is mass incarceration, said Associate Professor Michelle Alexander of Moritz College of Law, during a speech Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the war on drugs, racial incarceration is increasingly problematic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And for many, this may sound old-fashioned, but the racial caste system is alive and well in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>With more than 75 people in the audience, Alexander spoke at the African American and African Studies Extension Center, located at 905 Mt. Vernon Ave., as part of the lecture series, &#8220;Race, Drugs and the New Jim Crow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She supports the notion that the criminal justice system has &#8220;racialized social control&#8221; that is strikingly similar to the Jim Crow laws enacted between the 1870s and 1960s.</p>
<p>She said the comparison is valid because African Americans are treated like second-class citizens, except in a more extreme form of segregation than before, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When released, they are given the prison label for life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They are legally excluded from mainstream society for the rest of their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexander also said that ex-convicts suffer from political disenfranchisement because their voting rights are stripped from them. In some states, they must pay fees to reinstate their voting power and cover court costs themselves. This ultimately leads to lower voter turnout because no one would ever do that, she said.</p>
<p>Not only do black men suffer, but also black women. Alexander said that felons are denied welfare benefits, including food stamps, for life. This proves to be troubling for women especially, she said, because many of them have children to look after.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no surprise that these felons return to prison,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She also compared plantation labor, where slaves received little to no pay, to prison labor, where felons are used for cheap labor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alexander said that blacks are always viewed as criminals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said that black men have a virtual sign over their heads that says &#8220;criminal,&#8221; and that no one will hire a convicted felon, even if it is for something as minor as a first time drug offense.</p>
<p>Alexander said it is difficult to find a young, black man that has not had a humiliating experience with the police before. Racial profiling, she said, makes blacks subject to control, even if they haven&rsquo;t committed any crimes at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said that members of the African American community should implore elected officials to help improve education and develop housing assistance.</p>

New Yorks&rsquo; Gov. Patterson just announced a relaxation of the evil racist, hateful, Rockefeller Drug Laws.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_drug_laws" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_drug_laws</a></p>
<p>The &#8216;theory&rsquo; is that by not locking up offenders, offenders will seek treatment. (I know, I had a good laughed too).</p>
<p>Watch for drugs to explode in black communities. Watch for black communities to demand that something be done to combat the scourge of drugs in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It just goes around and around. When dealing with blacks, it&rsquo;s damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t because there is no solution when dealing with blacks. They are their own worst enemies.</p>

			<p>They act like that every black person caught with a little weed goes to prison.  The truth of the matter is if you&rsquo;re white, in a rural area, are caught with a little weed, and get the wrong kind of judge, you&rsquo;re going to prison.</p>
<p>A very high percentage of black men in prison for drugs are there because of a combination of dealing and related violence.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;She said that members of the African American community should implore elected officials to help improve education and develop housing assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A simple and interesting point here.</p>
<p>As is expected, like the overwhelming majority of her co-racial guilt mongers, this Comrade Alexander decries the American sociopolitical and criminal justice systems as &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; but also expects them to solve all of her &ldquo;community&rsquo;s&rdquo; problems as well. After all, just what systems are expected to &ldquo;improve education and develop housing assistance&rdquo; here?</p>
<p>It sure isn&rsquo;t the Lollipop Guild of Munchkinland!</p>

			<p>This is where disparete impact will release tens of thousands of black and hispanic felons.</p>
<p>Anti white racist organizations such as ACLU, ADL, SPLC, NAACP, NOW have filed numerous disparate impact lawsuits re the difference in expulsion and suspension rates for black, white, and hispanic boys.</p>
<p>The outcome is that a white boy must be expelled or suspended for every black or hispanic boy who is expelled or suspended.</p>
<p>So 4 black boys form a hunting pack and beat down a lone white.<br>
They are suspended.  Pursuant to court order, 4 white boys must be suspended on whatever bogus charge the anti white minority feminazis who run the schools can come up with.</p>
<p>So 4 white boys must be suspended for such crimes as smoking a cigarette across the street, failure to bring a textbook to class, posession of a prescription ashma inhaler etc.</p>

			<p>Johnson&rsquo;s war on poverty cost American taxpayers trillions.  Laws were changed and affirmative action was initiated to help blacks going back many years.  There was also a massive busing program of school kids to intergrate black kids into all the schools.  Needless to say this investment did not  pay dividends.  Blacks are still saying it&rsquo;s Whitey fault for not providing more assistance and better schools.  An argument is also made that it is racism because of the high percentage of black males in prison instead of the fact that the blacks commit the most crime by far. It&rsquo;s a sad fact that blacks never seem to take responsibilty for their conditions but also blame racism for  their plight.  I&rsquo;m sure they also believe that the 70% out of wedlock births is also Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>  Is not what she said &#8220;Profiling&#8221;?, She profiled ALL Whites as thinking this way. Welfare is a &#8220;benefit&#8221;, for what, just being born here in the USA? I would think just being here would be benefit enough.</p>

			<p>These are valid points:</p>
<p>to dump felons (black or white) back into society without job prospects or welfare benefits virtually guarantess they will reoffend.</p>
<p>They should be under close supervision, be given jobs &amp; training, drug treatment and counseling, and housing.</p>
<p>Why increase the odds of failure by depriving such people of resources they need to succeed?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Alexander said that blacks are always viewed as criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are viewed as criminals because 10 to 1 they are.  I&rsquo;ve been robbed twice in my life, and guess who were the culprits both times?  Instead of talking about &#8220;the new Jim Crow,&#8221; how about talking about blacks&rsquo; penchant for lawlessness and violence?  If a &#8220;new&#8221; version of Jim Crow was in place, black-on-white crime would be at a minimum - just like the good old days.<br>

			<p>It took me a long time to figure something out. That is that prison is the welfare for black men. In that they have no trade and no skills, and no ability to bare a child, they must be housed, fed and clothed and prison is where they get those things. So they commit crimes because they are otherwise useless to the society they live in and get their essential needs taken care of. When they get out, it is a very short time before they commit another crime to get back inside where at least, they&rsquo;re an integral member of that society.</p>

<p>Mine too.  They do a decent job. The younger ones can be a pain because of their lack of manners, uncivilized behavior and cursing.  Sometime between  35 and 40 they start to settle down.</p>
<p>Remember Rodney King who had a lengthy felony record before he became famous got a good job as grounds keeper at Dodger Stadium shortly after he was released from prison.<br>

<p>Thats a new one on me, that felons are denied welfare.  I doubt that her claims are true.</p>
<p>Also, even if a felon was denied food stamps, why would that impact their children? Poor children qualify for food stamps on their own.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea: don&rsquo;t break the law, and then you won&rsquo;t go to prison and lose other rights.  Of course, that would mean following the rules and modicum of self-discipline   &mdash;    not exactly traits blacks exhibit in abundance.</p>
<p>By all means, if you believe that the drug laws are ill-conceived, petition your government representatives to change them.  But no one has the right to break the law because he disagrees with it or finds it inconvenient.  In a democracy, we all play by one simple rule: we elect politicians to make the law, and we agree to follow the laws they make, even if we don&rsquo;t agree with them, and our recourse for change is through elections.  If someone (read: blacks) can&rsquo;t abide by that overriding rule, they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to participated in the process (vote for politicians).  Why should I, a law abiding citizens, have to follow laws that criminals have a say in making??  Why is it so hard for blacks to follow the rules of the game?!?</p>

			<p>I have a close relative that was convicted of a felony at age 18. He served his time and is now a wonderful husband and father at age 40. I will say that he graduated college, has repaid his student loans and now has a decent job, he was able to have his record set aside and can vote and hold office if he so desired. If a youthful offender could get some simblance of an education and stay out of trouble he could possibly make something of himself in a few years. It is hard work but worth it. </p>

			<p>If a black person wants to be able to vote all he has to do is not commit a felony.  Apparently Professor Michelle Alexander is enough of a race realist to realize that this is an unreasonably high bar for black men.</p>

			<p>In regards to the caste system, the author is right but  doesn&rsquo;t go far enough.  </p>
<p>There are at least TWO caste systems here, one by imposed by government, through the courts, affirmative action, consent decrees and the like, where whites are on the bottom; and the other in the free market, where whites are on top by dint of their smarts, creativity, law-abidingness, etc. </p>
<p>I would love to see drugs legalized because, as the late Milton Friedman would say, government shouldn&rsquo;t be passing laws to punish poeple where their behaviors affect primarily themselves.  Undoubtedly, for reasons I won&rsquo;t elaborate here, there would be less drug-related violence.  </p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that that policy change would suddenly empty our prisons of blacks, though, need only read a few weeks worth of AmRen to see the truth. </p>

			<p>Regardless of what race you are, there are liabilities, if you are either convicted of a felony offense or dishonorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces.  Under these circumstances, you cannot vote or hold public office, unless you complete a legal process of having sufferage rights restored.  But also you cannot own firearms or visit certain countries like Great Britain or Canada, unless you can get visa.  Whereas, anyone not under such a category, can just go to these countries with only a passport.</p>
<p>Martha Stewart, for example, was denied a visa to visit Great Britain because of her stock sale conviction.</p>
<p>But falling under either of these two categories, makes it very difficult to find employment, and will still make you a pariah in society.  Just like what happened to Jean Valjean when he released on parole in &#8220;Les Miserables.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, I found out on the internet that if you are dishonorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces, you cannot legally own land.</p>

<p>I will bet there was a lot of family and social pressure put on him to get his act together once he got out. And I am sure there were family members there to help him when he needed them. You don&rsquo;t find those kind of things in the Black community were Black men are nothing more that sperm donors and a young Black kid&rsquo;s family is a street gang.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m with April on this one. Though it is possible to get a job even with a criminal past, it is much more difficult.  Yes, we have too many criminals in America but we also have far too many laws.</p>
<p>As for the War on Some Drugs, it is wrong.  Even though it is wrong, it does have the benefit of locking up many young hoodlums who would be out murdering, robbing and raping if not for their drug sentences.  Hence, ironically, many innocent people are alive today due to the war on drugs.  If we randomly chose 15% of America&rsquo;s population for Human medical experiments, such a policy would also lead to better lives for the rest of us - but it would still be wrong.</p>
<p>Re: Kevin.  It takes decades or generations to change unjust laws such as prohibition.  Self-ownership is the basis of all freedom.  I highly recommend Jonathan Gullible for easy and entertaining perspectives on freedom:</p>

			<p>&#8220;members of the African American community should implore elected officials to help improve education and develop housing assistance&#8221; - What ? The fed spends billions of tax dollars on education, and Section 8 is destroying my suburban neighborhood with an influx of infantile minorities from the inner-cities. The housing crisis was due to affirmative-action lending, by giving mortgages to minorities who don&rsquo;t appreciate the value and privilege of home ownership. Between the Dept. of Ed. and HUD, &#8220;assistance&#8221; has led to a serious decay of the once high standard of living in America. It&rsquo;s not White people&rsquo;s fault that these so-called &#8220;victims of the system&#8221; are dysfunctional and sociopathic. Michelle Alexander is spewing the same old ethnocentric propaganda that has hamstrung blacks for decades.<br>

			<p>Another day, another piece of leftist twaddle and I must say the black academic noise making machine shows no signs of going away even as the PC Establishment celebration of blackness reaches ever more absurd heights. They figure they&rsquo;ve got whitey on the run and it&rsquo;s time to move in for the kill. &#8220;Civil rights&#8221; activism is not about justice it&rsquo;s about power and if anything the election of Obama has only emboldened blacks to behave even more outrageously and arrogantly than before. </p>
<p>Now, about this article. It&rsquo;s been repeated ad infinitum that the high black crime rate is the reason for their troubles with the law rather than the imaginary issue of &#8220;racism&#8221;. This really isn&rsquo;t that hard to understand and it speaks volumes that black activists would bring up the treatment of CRIMINALS as a sign of societal oppression. The fact that these people are lawbreakers doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing as long as they provide another excuse to hector whites.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Disparate impact&#8221;!? &#8220;Second class citizen&#8221;&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Whites who commit crimes are much more likely to be caught. I suppose that&rsquo;s considered a success and not a &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A Black person is 600 times more likely to rape a white woman than the reverse, 104 times more likely to rob, 36 times more likely to assault, and 14 times more likely to murder a white person, and yet they are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with an officially designated hate crime (and how many of those are crimes against Hispanics, Asians, immigrants or gays?). If you really are looking for injustice and a disparate impact or just some figures that don&rsquo;t add up, a good place to start looking would be there.  </p>
<p>It might be interesting to note that the media&rsquo;s (and education systems) coverage of these events is off by an even greater margin than the actual crimes (the media must share the black gene) - being that hate crime and racism for one are normally revealed to be whites victimizing anyone else. That&rsquo;s almost the definition of hate crime. The impassioned calls to end hate-crime just top off the cake. Or lead to even more hate crimes against whites if you want to look at it from a white perspective.   </p>

			<p>Felons can&rsquo;t vote?  What is this person talking about?  There aren&rsquo;t too many states that prohibit convicted felons from voting, and thanks to the wonderful doctrine of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; discussed here on AR in other stories of the last few days, the NAACP groups want to repeal that because it &#8220;disparately impacts&#8221; black men.</p>
<p>Also even if you live in such a state, if your felony is a state crime, you can still vote in Federal elections.</p>

			<p>Blacks could end much of this disparity simply by not committing violent crimes. has any black leader told their community to obey the law?</p>
<p>Still, there used to be a concept that once one had &#8220;done one&rsquo;s time&#8221; a former convict would return to society. There is something to be said about ending these draconian policies, such as denial of voting rights to ex-felons; the alternative is the creation of an increasingly large sector of disenfranchised people who return to crime, or who become the cannon fodder for radical political movements.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;members of the African American community should implore elected officials to help improve education and develop housing assistance&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>In other words, more justification for more liberal big government spending programs. One suspects that  Miss Alexander is not too much concerned about crime or dispossession of blacks, but in guaranteeing herself and her class of future jobs in the federal bureaucracy.</p>
<p><i>Watch for black communities to demand that something be done to combat the scourge of drugs in their neighborhoods.</i></p>
<p>And this is the dilemma. It is the black community which has demanded a war on drugs. But then the black community complains when its members end up in jail due to these very demands for a war on drug. Typical of too many Americans, they can not see the consequence of their actions.</p>

to dump felons (black or white) back into society without job prospects or welfare benefits virtually guarantess they will reoffend.<br>

The topic of Mariam Khan&rsquo;s speech is &#8220;O&rsquo;po me, i is black&#8221;. The topic is not &#8220;O&rsquo;po me, i is white&#8221; or &#8220;O&rsquo;po me, i is a ex-felon&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I seriously doubt that many Black felons are inconvenienced by being disenfranchised.  What percent of Black men vote anyway?  </p>

			<p>Someone was asking if black felons being denied welfare and other social program benefits like food stamps, health care &hellip;etc is true. As far as I know, its not a cut and dried you are a felon you don&rsquo;t qualify for X benefit. It is more like: You have a drug conviction? No public housing, no HUD loan no financial aid for school, nor for job training. Behind on child support (after a stint in prison)? No food stamps (this stupidity is nationwide). Addiction as &#8220;disability&#8221; was removed quite a few years ago (which makes getting drug treatment paid for problematic). </p>
<p>As far as the parole &amp; probation system; the system is designed to keep people &#8220;in&#8221; the system. Some of the fines, fees, and other bits for &#8220;services&#8221; truly are worse than the punishment for the crime involved. E.g., plead out to a simple domestic &#8220;He pushed me, she pushed me&#8221; case in my state and get forced into 3 years of &#8220;on book&#8221; supervision. Included in this is something benign sounding like &#8220;anger management classes&#8221;, &#8220;parenting classes&#8221;, and &#8220;abuse counseling&#8221;. You may think pay $350/500 fine and go home&#8221;, but in reality you are headed for anywhere from 6 to 35K of fees and extortion over that 3 year period as each of those &#8220;services&#8221; bills you, and your probation/parole officer and every other member of the counseling &#8220;services&#8221; team has the ability to keep taking on more classes, more fees&hellip;etc  The same is true for drug posession charges, DWIs, and other relatively minor offenses. DWI ends up costing about 25-30K before its over. Think the DA did you a favor moving your case over to &#8220;drug court&#8221;? Wait until you get the 10K-60K forced treatment bill, forced psychiatrist evaluation bill, social worker bill, weekly pee in the cup fee (currently $80 a week). Even the (sometimes forced)&#8221;job training&#8221; isn&rsquo;t free, though they do very little more than the unemployment office does. Get charged in the wrong county of my state, and you end up getting billed for meals and your stay in &#8220;jail&#8221; (currently at about $160 a day) pre-trial. (No, I&rsquo;m not kidding.) </p>
<p>Aside from draconian fees like the jail fee, there are a ton of people attached to the process. They all want their 40 pieces of silver.  It isn&rsquo;t really a racial thing, so I think the author is of on that, but he isn&rsquo;t entirely wrong to point out how ridiculous some of it is. </p>

			<p>If what this professor is saying is true, then the same laws also affect ex-convicts of all races. </p>
<p>He seems to be confusing two issues here : Blacks and the treatment of ex-convicts. </p>

			<p>The seminal issue is not incarceration but the arrest. Cut out  arresting Black - African -  Americans for anything and this problem would vanish!</p>
<p>Of course there might be other problems as a result.</p>

			<p>Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>Combining your point with mine I made earlier, I think the reason why the civil rights establishment so wants the reenfranchisement of convicted felons is that they want the votes for Democrats from black men.  Not that they&rsquo;ll actually go vote themselves, but their names will be on the voter registration list (motor voter, don&rsquo;t ya know), so that some corrupt black political machine can &#8220;vote&#8221; them after hours when the polls close.</p>

			<p>Associate Professor Michelle Alexander of Moritz College of Law is typical of most somewhat educated blacks who refuse to use their intelligence and training to see their race for its undeniable potential for breaking the law, often simply because it is &#8220;white mans law&#8221;<br>
The fact is, by her acceptance into the Bar, an officer of the court and bound to uphold the law.<br>
Racism prevails.</p>
