			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTK, Ceske Noviny (Prague), April 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Krupka  &mdash;  A far-right march of about a hundred supporters of the extremist Workers&rsquo; Party (DS) took place in Krupka without any major incidents.</p>
<p>Heavily armed police prevented a clash between the radicals and Romanies from the local housing estate.</p>
<p>When the extremists marched to the estate, two young Romanies threw a metal bar and a beer mug at them.</p>
<p>After this incident, Human Rights and Minorities Minister Michael Kocab who also arrived at the housing estate he calmed down the locals, supported by Romanies arriving from other places.</p>
<p>&#8220;A clash must be avoided. This would escalate and turn into a street guerilla war and we must let this happen,&#8221; Kocab told CTK.</p>
<p>Several extremist marches recently occurred in north Bohemian towns. Last weekend, unknown attackers threw Molotov cocktails in a house inhabited by Romanies in north Moravia. Three people very severely injured in the fire, including a small girl whose condition remains critical.</p>
<p>DS deputy head Petr Kotab criticised Krupka mayor for supporting &#8220;parasites&#8221; living at the local housing estate during the march this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Workers&rsquo; Party held a similar march a week ago.</p>
<p>After the organisers ended the march, a group of anarchists tried to attack them, but the police separated the two groups.</p>
<p>Far-right activists plan a massive protest on May Day in Brno.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m encouraged by these far-right parties emerging in Europe.  What will it take for America to get one of its own?</p>

			<p>  Thank God almighty for the Czechs!!! At least a group of whites somewhere in the world will stand together. Maybe, the U.S. and U.K. can learn something from the Czechs. </p>

			<p>The Romani Gypsies have been a curse to Europe since their arrival on the continent.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why politicians allow people to come from other countries and freeload off of the working people.  Why don&rsquo;t they stay in their own countries and work to fix their situation there?   I see this is going on all over the world!  The have-nots  parasitizing the productive. </p>

			<p>It never ceases to amaze me how politicians will label patriots defending their ancestral homelands and traditions &#8216;extremists&rsquo;,&rsquo;vigilantes&rsquo; and such, and out of the other side of their face exhort these same courageous folk and their precious children to go invade foreign soil under the guise of patriotism.</p>

			<p>Was a &#8220;possible clash&#8221; possibly going to be with muslims? call them what you want, I still bet the muslims were behind it.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how it is always the leftists and minority groups who resort to violence, yet we are the ones labeled as &#8220;extremists?&#8221; How exactly is it &#8220;extreme&#8221; to not want gypsies living in your neighborhood?  They bring crime and destruction wherever they go.  </p>

			<p>It should be added that Romanie Gypsies are basically Indians by origin. They originated in the Indian state of Rajasthan and traveled all across central Asia to Europe. Bearing this in mind America and Canada with their increasing population of Romanies are not much better off.After all the looks, mindsets and customs of these two groups are suspiciously similar.</p>

			<p>No muslims involved. This is a very old problem. Gypsies aren&rsquo;t liked in Europe since their arrival 700 years ago. They were once members of a very low caste in southern India. Their IQ is very low - 72-75 was found in a Serbian study, 78 in Czech and Slovak studies. Therefore they always end at the lowest level of the society around. <br>
The current problem is related to privatization of appartements and development in the city centers. Gypsies are removed from these commercially interesting localities and the developers buy for them cheaper appartements in smaller cities. But there live normal Czech people who bought their own appartements and gave all their lifetime savings for that. With the Gypsy influx not only their appartements lose value, but the people also see that they will be forced to move out by the noisy, dirty and aggressive habits of their new neighbors.</p>

			<p>The left side with the Roma for exactly the same reasons that they support Islam.</p>
<p>They HATE our Western culture and civilisation, and wish to subvert it by any means possible. They have bought into the childish (and demonstrably untrue) dictum that &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221;.</p>
<p>As someone once remarked on this site, the left are like people who employ tigers to catch mice. Just wait till their &#8220;pets&#8221; turn on them!</p>
