<p>Sahnoun Daifallah was sentenced to nine years in prison after being found guilty of four counts of contaminating goods.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old Algerian carried a mix of his waste in a container of weed killer concealed in a laptop bag, a court found. Using the nozzle, which poked out of the bag, Daifallah was able to spray large areas, leaving a powerful stench and causing tens of thousands of pounds (dollars) worth of damage.</p>
<p>Daifallah&rsquo;s first target was The Air Balloon pub and restaurant near the south England town of Cheltenham, which he visited around lunchtime on May 14. Kate Rochead, on duty that day, told The Associated Press she didn&rsquo;t know exactly what area he sprayed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daifallah next visited a bookstore in neighboring Cirencester, dousing hundreds of books  &mdash;  most of them in the children&rsquo;s section.</p>
<p>Two days later he struck in the nearby suburban area of Quedgeley, where a customer spotting him squirting the frozen french fries at a supermarket. Daifallah then drove four miles (six kilometers) to another supermarket, where an employee in the wine section noticed him acting suspiciously and reported an overpowering stench. Both supermarkets were closed for two days for cleaning. Shoppers reported suffering from rashes and nausea.</p>
<p>Local police said the products weren&rsquo;t handled by customers, but Morrisons, one of the supermarkets targeted, said a small number of goods were returned as a precautionary measure. Tesco, the other supermarket hit by Daifallah, declined comment.</p>
<p>Police were able to identify Daifallah using security camera footage. When they raided his home, they found a stockpile of the substance and plans to spread it. Plastic bags containing excrement were marked with the names of cities on them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judge Carol Hagen said Britain&rsquo;s security agencies had labeled him a high risk to public safety. Authorities have already begun deportation proceedings.<br>

			<p>About a year ago, alarmed at how many immigrants were in restaurants and food manufacturing, I started cooking more and started to grow some veggies. I have no doubt these third world people resent having to work menial jobs and do this type of behavior more than we know.</p>

			<p>I know why he did it. He hates White people. White people have no idea how much non-Whites especially browns and blacks hate us. Whatever the reasons for this emotion (jealousy, inferiority complex feelings, racism), we are a hated people in the world. I wonder how many non White chefs and take away owners have fed their body fluids to unsuspecting Whites. As I have always said, never ever eat at an eatery which is run or which employs non Whites especially browns and blacks. Want to eat Indian, Arab, Mexican or Malay food? Learn how to make it at home. It is easy in this information age. Or else only eat at eateries run and staffed by Whites. This stops our money going to these ungrateful invaders. Keep our money within the race.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Authorities have already begun deportation proceedings.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all?  No incarceration?</p>
<p>So now what?  He&rsquo;ll go to France or Belgium and repeat the whole disgusting procedure? And so on.  What&rsquo;s to stop him?  Maybe he&rsquo;ll come here.</p>
<p>Well, he couldn&rsquo;t have found a better way of expressing his true feelings for us.  And these are the people, we are endlessly told, who are enriching our culture!</p>
<p>PS. I am very surprised this story somehow got through the censorship and made it into the news. Somebody in Britain slipped up!</p>

<p>Pee in the tea or spit in the batter.  Its your life.</p>

			<p>&#8220;and do this type of behavior more than we know&#8221;<br>
I have worked in hospitality and food service all my life. Over 35 years to date. In all that time I have seen only one incident, much less disgusting than this one. But now I have to admit with the other posters here that the staff, the situation and the motivations have changed. It breaks my heart. </p>

That&rsquo;s just one who&rsquo;s famous   &mdash;    so we know about it, and only because he chose to tell us.   But how many others are there, by the millions, who aren&rsquo;t famous and who haven&rsquo;t told us about it?</p>

			<p>Jasper&hellip;. You hit the nail on the head! I&rsquo;m a construction electrician and have to work around way too many of these 3rd worlders, most of which are hispanic. They have flooded the lower skilled jobs in the industry and YES they hate us. Stand up to them and they REALLY hate you. The feeling is mutual&hellip;</p>
