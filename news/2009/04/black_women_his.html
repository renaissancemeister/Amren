<h1>Black Women, Hispanics Fuel Voter Turnout in 2008</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, AP, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly one-fourth of voters in last November&rsquo;s election were minorities, the most diverse election ever, fueled by high turnout from black women and a growing Hispanic population, an independent research group found.</p>
<p>The study by the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, also showed that for the first time blacks had the highest voter turnout rate of any racial or ethnic group among people ages 18 to 29. {snip}</p>
<p>Pew&rsquo;s analysis of census data found that whites cast about 100 million, or 76 percent, of the 131 million total ballots last November, compared with 79 percent in 2004. It was the sharpest percentage drop in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Blacks, meanwhile, had their sharpest increase in voter participation in more than a decade, with 15.9 million casting ballots to make up 12.1 percent of the electorate. Blacks previously had seen their share decline to 11 percent in 2004 after their low turnout in Republican George W. Bush&rsquo;s re-election win over Democrat John Kerry.</p>
<p>But in 2008, about 65 percent of blacks went to the polls, nearly matching the 66 percent voting rate for whites. Black women had the highest rates of participation among all voters at 69 percent; they were followed by white women (68 percent), white men (64 percent) and black men (61 percent).</p>
<p>Hispanics also had gains in voting share, mostly due to their rapidly growing population. In 2008, about 9.7 million, or half of Hispanics eligible to vote, cast ballots. They made up about 7.4 percent of the total voters, a jump from 6 percent in 2004.</p>
<p>Due to immigration and high birth rates, the number of Hispanics eligible to vote rose by 21 percent from 2004 to 2008 to 19.5 million, compared with a 5 percent increase for the general population. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other findings:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Among voters 18-29, blacks had the strongest participation rate in last November&rsquo;s election at 58 percent, compared with 51 percent overall in that age group. Blacks were followed by whites (52 percent), Asians (43 percent) and Hispanics (41 percent).</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The greatest increases in turnout were in Southern states with large black populations who were eligible to vote: Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>*&nbsp;About 47 percent of Asians, or 3.3 million, voted in 2008. They made up about 2.5 percent of total voters, up slightly from 2004.</p>
<p>The Pew analysis is based on the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey, which asked respondents after Election Day about their voting registration and turnout. The figures for &#8220;white&#8221; refer to the whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity.<br>

			<p>&ldquo;Pew&rsquo;s analysis of census data found that whites cast about 100 million, or 76 percent, of the 131 million total ballots last November, compared with 79 percent in 2004. It was the sharpest percentage drop in more than a decade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is truly one of the most deeply disturbing news items, I have ever read here at AR. With all the above considered, the only comfort we can reasonably draw from that horror show by numbers, is the fact that John McCain was about the most abysmally uninspiring old fool the Republicans could have thrown up this time around. Heck, I think even Bob Dole in 1992 was more of an original &ldquo;firebrand,&rdquo; than McNobrains was in 2008. </p>
<p>However, we must not take this as the world (or at least the USA) coming to an early end; in fact, give just how anti-white Senator McNobrains was in this election, we can see a slight glimmer of hope here. Senator McNobrains clearly had decided that for the good of multiculturalism and his continued &ldquo;non-racist&rdquo; acceptability at Washington DC cocktail parties, he would not smash this Red interloper in the kneecaps and then kick his face in before he could hit the floor, when he could have done so. </p>
<p>He had ample opportunity to do this, from the Jeremiah Wright fiasco to the grotesquely anti-white and hatefully un-American diatribes found in Comrade BO&rsquo;s books. However, what did he do on this score? He did absolutely nothing, is the answer; or put another way, he did all that he could do to lose the election, but come out and announce the week before it was being held, that he intended to vote for Comrade BO himself and would divorce his wife if she didn&rsquo;t do the same.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, even the treasonous Senator Arlen Specter, Communist fool that he is, probably would have put up a better fight!</p>
<p>If the Republicans are smart come 2012 (never a safe bet, I know) they will find a candidate that can inspire decent whites to get out and vote. That means a candidate that only concerns himself with white majority issues, and utterly rejects the dictates of multiculturalism and nonwhite fetishism.</p>
<p>If not, God help us all!</p>

			<p>The Democratic party is waging a vicious race war against Native Born White Americans. In fact the democratic party has been very open about they are doing this for the past five years. Just take a look at the former Governor of Vermont-Howard Dean- who ran for president in the 2004 election. He  is now chair of the DNC and stated on National TV that the Republican party is too White.</p>
<p>The anti-Native Born White Republican party is also waging a vicious raced-based war against the majority Native Born White America population. The Republican National Committe is now headed by a black who is openly ant-Native Born White American. </p>
<p>As post-1965 immigration policy continues apace for the next few years, the demographics will continue to change. And as a consequence in a few years amnesty will pass. Post-1965 asians,mulsims,hispanics,carribeans and africans will be able to force amenesty on Native Born White Americans at the polling both. The point is arriving- very soon- where the non-white majority in California,Texas,Arizona and New Mexico will have the demographic power to create their own immigration laws in these states. These states will have an open borders immigration policy. And as a consequence, the racial transormation in these staes will accelerate exponentially. The military,national guard and police departments will be mostly non-white in these states. They will not enforce any restrictionist immigration policy.</p>
<p>At some point in time,  the racial transformation of America will result in the US military and police forces around the nation being largely non-white. At this point in time, post-1965 non-whites will have the power to do anything they want to US-an ever dwindling Native Born White minority. Who would stop them.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow and vdare.com should start to declare itiself as a full-blown White Nationalist organization. Sailer&rsquo;s citizenship is complete nonsense. </p>
<p>If you have ever voted for  Nixon,Reagan, Bush and Bush The Lesser at  election time, you  voted for the racial death of Native Born White Ameicans within the borders of America. Nothing could be more obvious.<br>

			<p>Alas, John, the Reublicans will not be smart.  In fact, if you want to imitate a top-shelf Republican campaign strategist, just say &#8220;Hispanics are naturally conservative, we just need to get our message out to them.&#8221;  Then devise a strategy where you spend 8-times more per hispanic vote than for white votes, get 20 percent of the brown vote, then lose another election.  </p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics (mostly) lack political principles, but experience politics on a purely transactional level, i.e. &#8220;I vote for you, you route money to me.&#8221;  I know that, you know that, my two dogs probably know it, but I have yet to hear a Republican operative say it, even in private.  </p>

			<p>The problem is that there has not been a Presidential candidate who would not discriminate against Whites since FDR.  Truman integrated the military thus subjecting thousands of White female dependents and military women to rape by blacks. But my bete noir the feminazis still claim that military rape is done by Whites when they know full well it is done by blacks.</p>
<p>It also meant that White military men were subjected to pack attacks and beatings by blacks.  It also meant that our White military men were endangered by uselsss black fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>Eisenhower destroyed the schools by sending the army to enforce his appointee Earl Warren&rsquo;s busing aka black invasion orders.</p>
<p>Since Kennedy, every President has been more anti White than the last.</p>
<p>For whom should Whites vote, Republicans or Democrats?  The answer is neither.</p>
<p>The very worst of the worst of the affirmative action Presidents was neither Johnson nor Carter, but Nixon.  Virtually all the damage was done under his administration.</p>
<p>There is no reason for a White to vote, as both parties want us gone.  I get all sorts of emails from the Republicans.  I always email back something to the effect that because they  tossed into the trash their only supporters, Whites, especially White American men. The Democrats were formed in 1791 when Tom Jefferson travelled to New York City to meet with Aaron Burr to form an alliance.  The Democrats are the oldest political party in the world.  </p>
<p>The Republicans will disappear as did the Whigs and other parties.  Who knows if another party will appear to oppose teh Democrats even if in name only.  Since 1945 every President has issued various orders detrimental to Whites.</p>

			<p>A lot of the decline in the percentage of white voters was the fact that a couple million registered republicans (almost all white) did not bother to show up at the polls because of their disgust with McCain, or they had fallen victim to the psychological warfare waged by the media that the election was over weeks before it was held.  McCain would have suffered an even more humiliating defeat if it wasn&rsquo;t for Palin.  Where McCain failed the most was among white men, getting 11 percent fewer of them than Bush in 2004, McCain lost only 3 percent among white women as compared to Bush in 2004 (the Palin effect.)  The really disturbing thing is that so many white men became so angry over the financial meltdown that they voted for the most extreme leftwing candidate ever to run for president, and who was black on top of all that.  </p>
<p>Despite all that, white people have declined to only about 66 percent of the population, but still are three quarters of those who actually vote, so we are over performing as a group.  What the republican party has to do is develope a much more effective get out the vote operation aimed at white voters, keep hitting the issues of lower taxes, smaller and more efficient government, border control, and immigration enforcement.  Surveying the prospective candidates for 2012, only Palin has the real star power to increase the white voter turn out, win back the white women beyond the share won by Bush in 2004, and win back the majority of the white men.  It won&rsquo;t be easy for the GOP to win any future elections, but it&rsquo;s not impossible.  The only thing standing in their way is their refusal to acknowledge that the overwhelming number of votes they get are cast by whites, they can&rsquo;t outpander the democrats, so any attempt to increase the number of minorities who vote for them is just wasted time and money.</p>

			<p>To Ryan Chaserian, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, John, the Reublicans will not be smart. In fact, if you want to imitate a top-shelf Republican campaign strategist, just say &lsquo;Hispanics are naturally conservative, we just need to get our message out to them.&rsquo; Then devise a strategy where you spend 8-times more per hispanic vote than for white votes, get 20 percent of the brown vote, then lose another election.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
In some respects, the &ldquo;top-shelf&rdquo; Republican operatives seem to have lost all their marbles and most of their jacks too. They seem to think that effete Indians like Bobby Jindal and the marionette style hip-hop antics by Michael Steele, are going to save the party from being out &ldquo;diversified.&rdquo;  And their media mouthpieces like Rush Limbaugh or  Sean Hannity, only fuel their mania for self-immolation. In general, the one political pundit that they should have been listening to for the last two decade, Pat Buchanan, is all but ostracized by these beltway imbeciles.</p>
<p>However, this does not  mean that all hope is lost politically in this country; if the &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of the party and their &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media cronies keep it up and a few more elections are lost, perhaps there will be a massive schism in it that will lead to the creation of a pro-white preservation third party? A long shot in some respects, but not totally out of the question either. </p>
<p>All the best to you Ryan,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that McCain alienated alot of white men with his gung-ho support of amnesty, however I think another reason he lost was his gung-ho support of permanent foreign wars.  This was at least one more reason I would never vote for him (I voted for Chuck Baldwin - a no-hoper, but at least on the ballot).  I am completely uninterested in sending young American men off to be maimed and killed in order that Pentagon and State Department beauracrats should have an empire to amuse themselves with.  The Republicans need to wise up that we want a strong defence (starting at the arrival gate of JFK), not a foreign empire.</p>

<p>Yes, quite true.  That empty suit, Sean Hannity, still invites the oily and worthless Karl Rove onto his show to dazzle us with his political acumen.  This is the man who - more than any other - destroyed the republicans at the polls last November.  And Hannity fawns over him and picks his mind about political strategy as if he were Niccolo Machiavelli.  The republicans need to lose alot more, before they figure out that they&rsquo;re playing the wrong game.  Chances are, they won&rsquo;t figure it out, and they&rsquo;ll go the way of the Whigs.  And good riddance to &#8216;em too.</p>

			<p>Jupiter is absolutely correct. The D&rsquo;s have become the &#8220;anti-white&#8221; party. So why do any of us even consider voting for any of them??!! Evens with all the minority support, this socialist idiot in the White House would not have gotten there were it not for white liberal votes. Too many of us stand by and pat ourselves on the back for having voting &#8220;progressively&#8221; as this idiot turns the US into a Scandinavian style socialist country and further drugs thew white race&rsquo;s face in the ground.    </p>

<p>Margaret,</p>
<p>On a purely emotional level I agree with you 100%. However intellectually, I can&rsquo;t conceive of why those Whites who still largely control the two parties would want to see their own destruction. These &#8220;progressive&#8221; Whites also have children and grandchildren who will suffer the same fate as will ours. Why would they want to do that? Are they so delusional as to think that they will not be eaten by the Churchillian crocodile or do they have a secret plan for survival? Or have years of indoctrination erased their natural instinct to survive?</p>

			<p>S.L. Cain:</p>
<p>I agree with you about Karl Roverrated.  George W. Bush won two national elections in spite of Roverrated, not because of him.  Roverrated was the genius who thought it was a great idea for the Republicans to dump the Southern (read: white) strategy and chase after a racial demographic that will AT BEST give 40% of their votes to Republicans. </p>

<p>Many didn&rsquo;t vote at all, or refused to vote for McCain (who has deserted all we value).</p>
