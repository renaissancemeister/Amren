<h1>He Wears Skins; We Wear Veldskoens</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Roodt, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On April 2, the Zulu leader and president of the African National Congress (ANC), Jacob Zuma, met with Afrikaner leaders at the Hilton Hotel in Johannesburg. He shocked many blacks and English South Africans alike when he said: &#8220;Of all the white groups that are in South Africa, it is only the Afrikaners that are truly South Africans in the true sense of the word.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this mark the beginning of a historic alliance of two groups  &mdash;  Zulus and Afrikaners  &mdash;  who are often brushed aside by the ANC?</p>
<p>A veteran critic of Afrikanerdom, Allistair Sparks, once said that black rule came about in South Africa because the notion of Afrikaner sovereignty had been abandoned by former president F.W. De Klerk and his moribund National Party in the 1990s. The Afrikaner quest for freedom and independence had fuelled the Great Trek, two wars of independence against Britain, as well as the republican movement during most of the twentieth century. For the last ten years, however, it was almost as if Afrikaners had disappeared from South Africa. As part of Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s Africanist revolution  &mdash;  he was president from 1998 to 2008  &mdash;  all sorts of revanchist elements were settling historical scores with the Afrikaners. White English liberals and leftists, Natal Indians, and petty local municipal chiefs have all be hard at work.</p>
<p>Some of the worst damage was done while Kader Asmal was Minister of Education in the ANC government from 1999 to 2004, when he succeeded in all but eradicating the Afrikaans language from university education. Of course, Mr. De Klerk&rsquo;s deluded followers among the Afrikaners were enthusiastic participants in this process of destroying their own heritage and identity. The heads of Afrikaans universities, especially, acted like quislings, helping Mr. Asmal to destroy Afrikaans as a language of culture and learning. Mr. Zuma&rsquo;s rise to power and new-found affinity for South Africa&rsquo;s hated white tribe have changed all that. He has become almost an honorary Afrikaner, since he is vilified to a similar degree by both the British and the local English-language media.</p>
<p>It is not all that hard to see why. Mr. Zuma is a colorful figure who probably could not become head of state anywhere but in Africa. He is a former anti-apartheid guerilla leader whose theme song is &#8220;Bring Me My Machine Gun.&#8221; He was Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s deputy president until 2005, when he was fired because of alleged corruption. The case against him dragged on until just this month, when charges were finally dropped. Mr. Zuma, who had gotten revenge for his firing by toppling Mr. Mbeki as ANC party leader in 2007, argued that he had been framed by political enemies.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuma was also tried in 2005 on rape charges, but acquitted after the woman was unable to prove that the encounter was not consensual. There was considerable public derision over the fact that Mr. Zuma admitted that he knew the woman was HIV-positive but claimed he had taken necessary precautions after unprotected sex by showering. In a typical absurdist post-script to the case, the woman who brought the charges, Fezeka Kuzwayo, was granted asylum in the Netherlands in 2007. She convinced the Dutch she was in danger from Mr. Zuma&rsquo;s supporters.</p>
<p>Such, then, is the man who is likely to become South Africa&rsquo;s head of state if, as everyone expects, the ANC wins the general election on April 22.</p>
<p>The main force driving the rather straight-laced Afrikaners and Jacob Zuma into each others&rsquo; arms is the age-old political logic of &#8220;my enemy&rsquo;s enemy is my friend.&#8221; Apart from Mr. Zuma&rsquo;s impressive following among Zulus and ordinary black South Africans, he enjoys almost no support or sympathy among local and international elites. As a Zulu, he is also something of an odd man out in a party now dominated by Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s Xhosa tribe. Afrikaner support would be very useful to him.</p>
<p>There are other factors that draw him to the white tribe. Mr. Zuma occasionally wears traditional Zulu dress, which is frowned upon in a country where mainstream political commentators have declared that ethnicity is dead.</p>
<p>The Afrikaners in turn remain attached to their ways: According to the <cite>Concise Oxford Dictionary,</cite> a &#8220;veldskoen&#8221; can be either a shoe or a &#8220;South African conservative or reactionary,&#8221; and some Afrikaners have begun to see Mr. Zuma as something of a conservative.</p>
<p>If Mr. Zuma continues his overtures toward Afrikaners, a large portion of the Afrikaans intellectual, academic, and even business elite may support him and bolster his defenses against the almost hysterical campaign waged against him by what we call the &#8220;Afro-Saxon&#8221; and Anglo-Saxon elites. Assuming that Mr. Zuma takes office as president on April 22, he will inherit a public sector packed with Mbeki supporters who might still try to undermine him. Corruption is rife in the public sector and is partly contributing to the steady collapse of South African infrastructure. Mr. Zuma will need Afrikaans expertise and discipline if he is to uproot corruption and tackle the crisis of governance, especially at the local level.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuma also appears to be sensitive to food security. Mr. Mbeki and his minister of land affairs, Lulu Xingwana, squandered billions in tax revenue appropriating mostly Afrikaner-owned farms and taking them out of production. The millers and supermarket owners applauded this destruction of Afrikaner agriculture because it would finally let them shop for the cheapest produce on the international market. South African wheat growers have virtually abandoned production and we now import lower-quality wheat from Argentina.</p>
<p>A new romanticism holds that the world should abandon large-scale industrial farming of the kind perfected by the Afrikaners in favor of traditional peasant farming on small plots, using primitive and therefore &#8220;green&#8221; methods. US and British foundations, as well as the local English universities, have long embraced this philosophy and would like to see Afrikaans farmers removed from the land. Such a move would also sound the death-knell for the Afrikaners&rsquo; age-old dream of a separate sovereign state, as they would no longer own or occupy much land in South Africa.</p>
<p>However, as Oxford economist Paul Collier wrote in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, rising food prices are a major threat to the poor, especially Africans. Despite singing about machine guns, Mr. Zuma is a realist who acknowledges the limitations of global romanticism and African-style &#8220;agrarian reforms&#8221; of the kind that are destroying Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Food  &mdash;  like oil  &mdash;  has become a strategic resource. A famine-stricken South Africa would invite intervention by America and Britain and put Mr. Zuma&rsquo;s presidency in peril. Mr. Zuma therefore needs those veldskoen-wearing Afrikaans farmers as much as they need him to stop the revolution emanating from South Africa&rsquo;s three or four large cities. Driven by Mr. Mbeki&rsquo;s pan-African philosophy of the African Renaissance and illegal immigration, those cities have adopted a cultural ideal reminiscent of the chaos of a Lagos hotel lobby, and see both Afrikaners and Zulus as unwanted relics from the past.</p>
<p>The strategic synergy between the Zuma-led ANC and Afrikanerdom is clear: the one has political clout in the form of numbers and populist appeal, the other has know-how and technical expertise, as well as agricultural capacity that could ensure South Africa&rsquo;s independence.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/13/AR2009041302994.html?sid%3DST2009041303012&amp;sub=AR">White Afrikaners in S. Africa Hear Inclusive Voice From ANC Leader</a></h2>
						<p>A white pastor spoke of the &#8220;tremendous amount of hurt&#8221; his fellow Afrikaners feel in black-ruled South Africa. A man complained that racial quotas keep white children off school sports teams. Another fretted about dwindling education in Afrikaans, the language of Afrikaners.</p>
<p>The guest of honor at the gathering of Afrikaner organizations last month, former anti-apartheid guerrilla Jacob Zuma, stood and smiled. He apologized for his &#8220;problematic&#8221; Afrikaans, which he had learned during a decade as a political prisoner, then delivered his message: Just as I cherish being a Zulu, so should you cherish being Afrikaners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve always said we are a unique country. We&rsquo;ve got a tribe, a white tribe, that is African in every respect,&#8221; said Zuma, leader of the nation&rsquo;s ruling party, which is expected to sweep elections next week that will deliver him the presidency. He received a standing ovation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His party, the ruling African National Congress, has been wooing Afrikaners  &mdash;  descendants of mainly Dutch and French settlers whose presence here dates to the 17th century  &mdash;  and other minority groups with renewed vigor. Afrikaners make up less than 6 percent of the population, 9 percent of which is white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zuma, a down-to-earth populist, visited a squatter camp of Afrikaners last year. Last month, he sent an ambassador to the most extreme example of Afrikaner nationalism, the desert town of Orania. There, Afrikaners have carved out an all-white enclave where they hope to create an independent state dedicated to preserving a culture they fear is being swallowed up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For that, some Afrikaner organizations blame the ANC government. It has closed or made bilingual 90 percent of the Afrikaans-language schools that existed in 1990, AfriForum says, and changed street and town names honoring Afrikaners. Affirmative-action laws have squeezed Afrikaners out of work, it says, and even the famed springbok mascot of rugby  &mdash;  a sport something like a religion for Afrikaners  &mdash;  has come under attack as an apartheid-era symbol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some Afrikaners have retreated into suburban isolation. Political analysts say many do not vote; of those who do, most vote for the Democratic Alliance, the main opposition party, which derives much of its support from whites. Many others have emigrated. Some research suggests that 1 million whites have left South Africa since 1995, an unknown number of whom are Afrikaners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To a casual observer, Afrikaans culture hardly shows signs of dying. Rugby matches, where ruddy Afrikaners eat barbecued boerewors, or farmers&rsquo; sausages, are wildly popular. Afrikaans-language literature sells well, and TV shows in the language are common. Rock music in Afrikaans is exploding. While scholars such as Rossouw lament the new media as superficial, others say they provide cultural space for young Afrikaners.</p>

<p>Even so, I&rsquo;ve been hearing about this Zuma guy for a long time now and my consensus is that really the article doesn&rsquo;t make him look nearly as bad as he is.  The picture, however, is perfect.</p>

		<p>The Whites in S. Africa are nuts to listen to this Zuma guy. If they fight maybe they can carve out a Whites only country. Honestly though, it is just a matter of time before a Mugabe-type is elected and the Whites in S. Africa will be wiped out or they will immigrate to America(the English speaking ones) or to The Netherlands(the Dutch speaking ones).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this?  I haven&rsquo;t heard about Orania before.  Sounds inspiring.</p>
<p>Also while Zuma is just as bad as every other african politician, it&rsquo;s better to have one in office that is corrupt in white people&rsquo;s favor, than one that openly wants them exterminated.</p>

		<p>This guy is a known savage but is not completely stupid. He has seen what Rhodesia has brought upon itself. Certainly he is no long time friend to the Afrikaners. He is lucid enough to realize stone age farming will not feed millions of city dwellers. As a farmer&rsquo;s son I feel the tie with family farm land that they Dutch feel in S. Africa. My heart breaks for the choices their kids must make.(stay or go) Their land has little value. Would you invest in S. African land? Sadly,they may have a better long term future than me here in Louisiana. </p>

		<p>Too bad American Whites couldn&rsquo;t be more supportive allies to the great Afrikaner Whites, why should they have to depend on Zulus. But, who knows. Whites have always had affection for warrior tribes - and the Zulus are one.</p>
<p>But, I feel comforted in knowing that few or any Afrikaners or Zulus will ever have to put up with the bitter, no fun American feminists that have been the curse of my life.</p>
<p>Think any Zulu will get called in front of a Human Rights Commission for saying something &#8220;sexist&#8221;?</p>

		<p>dont believe this guy, he just needs the white vote to get elected, then he will turn on them even worse than the other leaders&hellip;.remember he is a zulu and the zulus and boers are historic enemies, due to the battle of blood river 1838, where a few hundred boers defeated the zulu army of thousands. boers need to leave south africa completely, then the blacks can turn their racism on the white english liberals..its a win win situation..boers leave, all the infrastructure falls apart, blacks turn on the white liberal english who hates the boers, and the boers get their just reward&hellip;blacks suffer, english gets wiped out&hellip;.de la rey..</p>

		<p>Malema the ANC youth league leader visited Orania and stated that he was impressed with the community&rsquo;s economical &amp; developmental tactics, he obviously conveyed his findings to Zuma, who later declared that if Orania&rsquo;s strategies and idée of taking care of your own community was practiced across Africa, poverty would be a thing of the past.

		<p>My advice to Afrikaners is to work with people like Zuma to get as much living space as you can possibly hold as soon as possible. Keep your frontiers as open as possible and keep them as free of blacks as possible. The day will come when a black politician has the thought of taking all of your land. With a black army this will be hard for them, but they might get WMD from China or elsewhere to make the job easier. </p>
<p>It would be wise to fortify your position as early as possible if you intend on keeping your homeland. Make nuclear proof bunkers where there are absolutely no blacks allowed. Do not allow your civilization to become just another ruin in the African wilderness. </p>

		<p>His remarks are easily explained by the fact that he is aware of the Zimbabwean train wreck.  Mugabe removed the White farmers, and his nation is now economically crippled and starving.  The Zimbabwean situation could easily be repeated in South Africa.</p>
<p>Zuma simply wishes to coax the South African Whites into continuing to economically support the South African Blacks.  He will continue to pay them lip service as he happily takes their economic and agricultural contributions, while working aggressively to completely erase their history, culture, and future.</p>
<p>South African Whites who fall for his blarney will someday bitterly regret their lapse of reason.   </p>

		<p>I lived in South Africa for 24 years so I know the cultures.  The Afrikaners were chased out of Europe in the 18th century by religious persecution, they moved away north from the British when Britain bought the Cape area in 1810, and then they were chased off much of their land by the Nritish for the extensive mineral, but one fact still applies.  Never trust any black African as they have few scruples.  Once the land is flourishing again, the whites will be chased off the continent as this is the intention of the African Union (who prefer Mugabe to those white Africans who brought, and still do, much prosperity to Africa.  Remember that they have tried it before over the last 150 years and the black tribes treacherously attacked them, but the Afrikaners won all the days until the West interfered against Apartheid which was not as bad as the propaganda stated.  <br>
Zuma has little education and gains popularity by dancing with an AK47 chanting &#8220;Kill the Boers&#8221; (white farmers).  </p>
<p>If only Africa had been &#8220;won&#8221; as the USA was.</p>

<p>This is a part I don&rsquo;t get about White South Africaners. They seem to NEED blacks working in their homes and almost without fail, it is those same blacks that betray them. They should get rid of the blacks in their homes and keep them out, and stop keeping their GUNS IN THE SAFE!!!!! a common thread, &#8220;we heard the break in and went to the safe to get our guns when they jumped us&#8221; I just don&rsquo;t get those Whites in SA.</p>

		<p>Any South African white, whatever his ancestry, who&rsquo;s not devoting all his energy to escaping the coming hell, dispossession, and slaughter that will visit South Africa is delusional.</p>
<p>The only thing that can save Africa would re-coloninization.  Obviously, that&rsquo;s not going to happen, at least by whites.  Perhaps the Chinese are feeling charitable about restoring order, for a price.  My guess is that the surviving black Africans will remember the white European colonizers fondly if that happens.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t have it both ways, but they certainly can, and do, in every way. Every time. It looks like blacks are destined to have to have both Africa and W Europe.<br>

<p>Wrong.  If you survey the western zeitgeist honestly, you must conclude that ultimately, it&rsquo;s okay for blacks to run whites out of Africa (if not mass-murder them outright), but not okay for whites to even think about limiting the inflow of blacks into Europe, much less expatriating the blacks already there.  You&rsquo;re suggesting a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re arguing under the erroneously assumed aegis of universalism.  Blacks don&rsquo;t tell one another that they should be fair to whites in order to elicit reciprocity, so why should whites do so?  There&rsquo;s some universalism for you.  Here&rsquo;s more - neither the Amerinds, nor the original inhabitants of the territory upon which South Africa was formed (which as I understand the matter, excludes the majority of black South Africans) surrendered on the basis of universalism or anything else; they fought against the white invaders, and lost; so the true universalist message here is, &#8220;everyone has the right (if not the duty) to fight for his own and to hell with the other guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, I must have missed the part where a) non-whites reciprocate universalism, and b) non-whites surrendered the way you suggest (i.e., while in a position of overwhelming military and economic (inter alia) superiority).</p>

		<p>Food is political power. In the ancient world egypt was the breadbasket. Due to the annual flooding, it was a dependable renewable source of food. Egypt was either an empire ot the most important province of an empire. The opposite is zimbabwie.<br>
  I am unsure of the politics of the region. I recommend to the africanneers that they drive a hard bargain to support Zulu. You want an all white land- kick out your black servants and laborers, and allowed to have all white military units that are commanded by whites.</p>

		<p>Regarding &#8220;White Africans&#8221;: The Dutch Boers were in South Africa before the Blacks.  When the Dutchmen showed up, the people they saw were Brown, not Black, Bushmen, Pygmies, and related peoples.  The Blacks came along later.  Surely, if there is such a thing as an &#8220;African American&#8221;, White Africans must be a possibility too.</p>

		<p>Skip, I believe there is a law in South Africa that citizens must keep their guns in locked safes in their homes.  I don&rsquo;t know the reasoning behind the law but it does slow down a citizen&rsquo;s response time by crucial seconds when he needs to defend himself.</p>
