			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Barnes, Washington Post, April 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court has an opportunity to reaffirm or reshape the nation&rsquo;s civil rights laws as it faces a rare confluence of cases over the next two weeks, including a high-profile challenge brought by white firefighters who claim they lost out on promotions because of the &#8220;color of their skin.&#8221; </p>
<p>The cases also touch on the Voting Rights Act, the need to provide English classes for immigrant children and, more tangentially, discriminatory mortgage lending. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The court will hear the arguments, along with the others, in the midst of an evolving national conversation about the role of race and diversity and in the wake of the historic presidential election. </p>
<p>&#8220;Each of these cases goes to the ability of our society to achieve opportunity, fairness and ultimately to our ability to be the democracy that we aspire to be,&#8221; said John Payton, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve made tremendous progress as a society, and some of that progress is having in place anti-discriminatory&#8221; laws to ensure it continues. </p>
<p>His organization calls for the court in each case to affirm a vigorous role for government in recognizing the need for race-conscious vigilance. </p>
<p>But Edward Blum, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, envisions a chance for the court to acknowledge the strides that the country has made, even if it decides each case narrowly. </p>
<p>The court could &#8220;send a signal to government units that race and ethnicity should play a smaller and smaller part in their decisions,&#8221; Blum said. </p>
<p>He said he thinks the court took the firefighter case &#8220;because it wants to make a statement. And of all the cases involving race and ethnicity, I think this is the easiest for the court to answer.&#8221; </p>
<p>The justices are deeply divided about government policies involving race, even if Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has shown no such ambivalence. His view was evident quickly, when in a first-term dissent he lamented the &#8220;sordid business&#8221; of dividing individuals by race. </p>
<p>Others on the court seem just as firm, but on both sides of the issue. That often leaves Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, generally skeptical of race-based policies, as the target for opposing lawyers. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;The court will hear the arguments, along with the others, in the midst of an evolving national conversation about the role of race and diversity and in the wake of the historic presidential election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is where things get tricky, to say the least!</p>
<p>While I am for the total smashing and charring of affirmative action, I do not, nor will I ever wish for that to indicate that we are or ever should be, a &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; or &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; society. As far as I am concerned, this country must have two intertwined sets of racial polices/laws: Apartheid and White Majority Preservation.</p>
<p>Apartheid is the bulwark, through which White Majority Preservation can flourish; the ultimate goal here being, the return of the USA to an 87% or greater majority. Nonwhites in this country must be: segregated, regimented, and ultimately reduced in numbers. This does not mean slaughtering them, or even deporting them (excluding illegal alien invaders, of course.) What it means, is allowing them to live in our country under tight &ldquo;freedom of movement&rdquo; and reproductive controls. If they do not like this, if they find it intolerable, then they should be allowed to voluntarily emigrate. </p>
<p>That is what the USA should be doing toward removing &ldquo;racial conflicts;&rdquo; of course, one does not expect: General Secretary BO, the current Congress of People&rsquo;s Deputies, or the People&rsquo;s Court and Commissariat of the Interior, to implement such a rational program.</p>
<p>They prefer the alternative, the total genocide of the white race through dissembling &#8220;diversity&#8221; fiats!</p>
<p>As always, God Help Us All!!!<br/>

			<p>Usually it is the laws that have to catch up with society.  In the white firefighters case it is black society that needs to catch up with the laws.  The door has been open for a generation now but for whatever reason they seem determined to underachieve.  I think that all affirmatave action laws need to be sunsetted.  10 years, tops.  They have run out of excuses.   </p>

			<p>These whites simply want to mock Civil Rights by claiming that they are somehow oppressed.  Their depravity knows no depths.  Initially, the argument was so preposterous as to stun the Civil Rights community into a paralyzed silenced.  This shockingly obtuse reversal could only last so long.</p>

<p>One mans&rsquo; anti-discrimination is another mans&rsquo; discrimination. Some criteria for &#8216;discriminating&rsquo; (making distinctions on any number of factors) is always in the mix.</p>
<p>It is fair to discriminate against a white candidate with better qualifications in favor of a black candidate with lesser qualifications? The NAACP believes this is fairness.</p>
<p>I can see any of these cases going either way. One could argue that we have a black President because of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;. You can also argue that electing a black President shows that &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; is no longer needed.</p>

			<p> How can city corporation counsel Bolden claim that black firefighters were &#8220;locked out&#8221; by a test that &#8220;didn&rsquo;t measure the firefighters&rsquo; fitness for promotion accurately?&#8221; Whose opinion is that? For in fact it is nothing but an opinion   &mdash;   not a fact. But this IS a fact: 27 black firefighters   &mdash;   all who took the test   &mdash;   failed to score high enough to make the cut.</p>
<p> Does anyone really believe that after all these years of feverish attempts to make such tests totally &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;race neutral,&#8221; the fact that not one black firefighter was among the higher scores, doesn&rsquo;t say something significant about blacks&rsquo; collective IQ, as compared to Whites&rsquo;?</p>

			<p>White males are the only groups that is NOT protected.  The aim of this can only be seen as aimed at eliminating the White race.  While the left constantly speaks of genocide of this group, that group, etc., it ignores the insidious but obvious path American society is on.  But no one has really thought about what things really be like when there are no more White people. One thing is for certain, there will be no one left to protect and no one to protect them.</p>

			<p>THE US NUREMBERG STYLE COURT WILL DECIDE AGAINST WHITES.</p>
<p>Why was this case brought up after Bush left office.  With a Bush solicitor general, the firemen might have a chance to win, but with the Great Satan Obama&rsquo;s solicitor general, they will not have a chance.  The four conservative leaning judges will compromise (surrender) to the Marxists and decide against the firemen.  Discrimination against WHITE MALES is now institutionalized and accepted by RACIAL GUILT RIDDEN WHITES. </p>
<p>White Americans are now the equivalent of Third Reich Jews. </p>

<p>These Whites just want to mock Civil Rights by claiming to have any&hellip;&hellip; right - Black Insurgent?</p>
<p>Are you sure of the use of &#8220;obtuse&#8221; in your sentence?  Nice try at sophisticated dialogue.</p>
<p>Like the situation in Zimbabwe or SA, Blacks in America will eventually be their own worst enemy - as if they aren&rsquo;t now.  But unfortunately, Whites will suffer a great deal too.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;white firefighters who claim they lost out on promotions because of the &#8216;color of their skin.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What else could it possibly be?  The test had been vetted throughly, in fact in devising the test IOS states:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;There was a deliberate overrepresentation of minority incumbents in this process&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;New Haven paid a reported $100,000 to I/O Solutions to devise a nondiscriminatory test. It wound up being 60 percent written, 40 percent oral. To judge the candidates&rsquo; oral responses, New Haven paid to bring in 30 veteran fire department managers from around the country, two-thirds of them minority&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Firefighters today must be not only brave but technologically competent as well  &mdash;  which requires intelligence  &mdash;  otherwise why have a test at all?  There are, after all,  lives at stake  &mdash;  but the diversity police could not care less about lost lives (especially White lives).  More important is promoting unqualified NAMs  &mdash;  and ignoring inherent black-White differences in intelligence, something this test made obvious.</p>
<p>Steve Sailor writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;No blacks scored high enough to qualify for promotions. On the Lieutenants&rsquo; exam, the mean black score would have fallen at the 20th percentile among whites. On the harder Captain&rsquo;s exam, the mean black score fell at the 10th percentile for whites&hellip;There is nothing surprising or anomalous about these percentiles. They&rsquo;re almost identical to blacks&rsquo; and Latinos&rsquo; results on professional school tests such as the LSAT used by law schools and the MCAT employed by medical school&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/dhjhbg</p>
<p>And finally this triumph for Equal Protection:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;last month a court awarded $6 million dollars to the last 75 of 175 white firemen discriminated against on the City of Chicago&rsquo;s 1986 promotion test &mdash; a 23-year struggle, but one the white firemen finally won&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There may be hope after all but in this reign of terror all bets are off.</p>

<p>They were denied jobs because they were right.  Either the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; must be for all Americans, not just non-whites. That&rsquo;s the problem with most blacks like you.  You want equality&hellip;yet you want segregate yourself from others and you especially don&rsquo;t want whites to be left alone.</p>

			<p>these guilt-riddled whites need only to learn 5 things and let it sink in to heal themselves..one, they never owned any slaves. two, most white people in america today are the ancestors of the europeans that came through ellis island between 1890 and 1910. three, 600 thousand white boys died ending slavery. four, all the racial problems that america has are caused by blacks and their accusations against whites. and five, it is the year 2009, not 1840, get over it.</p>

<p>Huh? Who are &#8216;these whites&rsquo;? The New Haven firefighters? What argument? That they should be promoted because they scored the best on the qualification test?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll assume both and ask you why you think this is preposterous? What is your thinking? I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Also, they don&rsquo;t claim oppression. They claim discrimination. Are we talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>Black insurgent, we here know that expecting logic to come out of a black head is asking too much. We also know that there is no word for &#8220;fairness&#8221; or &#8220;consistency&#8221; in Ebonics. The only abstract principle that blacks understand (and understand implicitly and completely) is race. </p>
<p>Your people are our teachers in that regard. The daily abuses of your people who cannot help violating our sense of decency, our sense of reason and correctness, and our sense of law and order, sends more and more whites to racialist thinking even against our better natures. Continue in your foolish self confidence and escalate things some more. Please throw some more temper tantrums (riots) when things don&rsquo;t go 100% your way. You buffoons are the best propaganda for our cause without even trying. </p>
<p>&#8220;But no one has really thought about what things really be like when there are no more White people. One thing is for certain, there will be no one left to protect and no one to protect them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whiteplight, what these insurgents don&rsquo;t understand is that America is full of white people. We are all over the place whether they like it or not. </p>

			<p>I checked the constitution. The right to a job you&rsquo;re not qualified for is not in there, but equal protection under the law is. This should be a no brainer for the court. <br/>

			<p>Intelligence tests will ALWAYS create group level disparate impact, and everybody knows the pecking order, so either do away with intelligence tests altogether and just admit that your goal is racial quotas rather than excellence, or value color blind excellence, without regard to racial disparate impact.  It&rsquo;s one or the other.  You cannot pretend to value excellence as the standard and then elevate lower achieving, less qualified people solely to achieve a desired racial balance.</p>
<p>I hope that the court expresses in clear, unambiguous language that either excellence without regard to race, or a predetermined racial mix, without regard to excellence is the highest goal.  They&rsquo;re mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>That there is legal discrimination against whites is beyond dispute.  What I hope gets achieved by this suit is to expose as absurd the attempt to pretend that all groups are equal in intelligence, and the pretend notion that if there are disparate outcomes in intelligence tests, it is because white people deliberately created tests to keep blacks and other minorities scoring worse.  A patently absurd notion, but this is the reasoning we are asked to accept for why blacks score lower than whites.</p>
<p>Anything to expose that lie is a good thing, and I think in Roberts, we may just get that clear, unambiguous language.</p>

			<p>If there are tests at all, they will be discriminatory.  </p>
<p>The question is, do you discriminate on the basis of intelligence, or do you overtly discriminate against whites, on the basis of race.  It really is that simple, and that stark.</p>
<p>Should be entertaining to see how the leftists spin their justification for discriminating against whites while trying not to admit that real reason is that blacks are less intelligent than whites and can&rsquo;t compete on intelligence tests.  Get ready for some real pretzel logic.</p>

			<p>I saw Lou Dobbs interviewing the New Haven city attorney, an affirmative action attorney who was also counsel for the NAACP.</p>
<p>What a surprise.  Anyway, Mr. affirmative action proudly boasted that &#8220;more than 300 of America&rsquo;s biggest corporations&#8221; agree with the city and plan to file friend of the court briefs advocating discrimination against whites and assisting the city with research .  Probably with money too, all to deny white men jobs.</p>
