<h1>BMI Not an Accurate Obesity Measurement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>RedOrbit, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Published online today in British Journal of Nutrition (DOI 10.1017/S0007114509325738) the new study shows &#8220;that the number used to indicate weight category does not reflect the same amount of body fat for some races compared to others,&#8221; according to senior authors Dr. Andrew Jackson, Emeritus Professor of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston and Dr. Molly Bray, Associate Professor of Pediatrics  &mdash;  Nutrition at the USDA/ARS Children&rsquo;s Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &#8220;The results are consistent with other studies that say BMI is inexact and should be tailored to help target those at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>BMI is a formula that estimates a person&rsquo;s body fat using only his/her weight and height. The result is then used to determine weight categories: 18.5 and below is considered underweight; 18.6-24.9 healthy; 25-29 overweight and 30+ obese.</p>
<p>&#8220;This scale was created years ago and is based on Caucasian men and women,&#8221; says Bray, &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t take into account differences in body composition between genders, race/ethnicity groups, and across the lifespan.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the current study, rather than using other potentially biased methods employed in the past as &#8220;gold standards&#8221; to examine body composition, researchers used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, which is a low dose x-ray known as DXA, to determine percent fat.  DXA can be used to estimate bone density, lean mass and fat mass.</p>
<p>When the two results were compared, researchers found that the DXA estimate of percent fat of African American women was 1.76 percent lower for the same BMI compared to non-Hispanic white women. Since BMI is assumed to represent body fatness, an African American woman would not be considered overweight or obese until she reached a higher number than what is indicated by the current BMI standards. The opposite is the case for Hispanic, Asian and Asian-Indian woman. Their percent fat is higher by 1.65 percent, 2.65 percent and 5.98 percent, respectively. So they would be considered overweight or obese at amounts lower than what the BMI standards indicates. The results for men were similar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now non-Hispanic white women are not considered obese until they have a BMI of 30 or above.  Based on our data in young adults, for Hispanic women the number would be around 28,&#8221; says Bray. &#8220;For African American women the number to cross is around 32.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bone mineral content, hydration state, and the density of lean mass found in different ethnic groups are some factors that account for the differences.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results demonstrate that body composition measures obtained from DXA can be used to more accurately define risk factors and provide better recommendations for the treatment and care for patients,&#8221; explains Bray.</p>

			<p>How does this fit into &#8220;race is a social construct?&#8221;  Or &#8220;there&rsquo;s no such thing as race?&#8221;  Clearly, brown fat cells are discriminatory, so it&rsquo;s time for Morris Dees to sue.</p>

			<p>BMI is utterly useless? Tell me something i don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Though the article is just the standard pseudo scientific/racist double think by liberals.<br>
All minorities are equal&hellip; except when it comes to skin color, physical appearance, and now weight.. and genetics.. oh my it&rsquo;s looking like there is some basis to this whole &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;aparthied&#8221; thing after all!</p>

			<p>The BMI has long been questioned.  The muscle to fat ratio is the relevant one.</p>

			<p>Standard weight charts based on a person&rsquo;s sex and height increase every decade anyway. </p>
<p>Perceived exertion chart?! What?! (Let me assign a number to how I feel during a workout. That tells me nothing.)<br>
 <br>
I&rsquo;m old school. I do weights to get my heartrate up before I do cardio. I don&rsquo;t stop cold turkey during cardio. I take my 10-second heart rate when I&rsquo;m done with my cardio and do another 15 minutes to save my knees while keeping my heartrate up at the fat burning rate. </p>
<p>Know your body! (I became interested as an overweight kid.)<br>
I&rsquo;m doing something right. I&rsquo;m the thinnest and tonest at the gym with more energy than most. It&rsquo;s just natural. </p>
<p>Work smarter; not harder! No excuses! I just happen to be white with no apologies.  </p>

			<p>Who cares about BMI? Last time I checked, a mirror can tell people whether or not they need to lose weight. Although it would not surprise me if non-whites accused mirrors of racism because they dislike what they see.</p>

			<p>Apart from the muscle mass to fat ratio problem. One thing that always made me think of the BMI as a weak indicator was leg length to body length ratio.</p>
<p>Some people have relatively longer legs, and shorter bodies, and others longer bodies and shorter legs for the *same height*</p>
<p>Given that bodies would weigh more than legs, this is a definite distorting factor.</p>

			<p>The natural state of Africans is to be thin, since in their native enviroment food is scarce and the likelyhood of offspring reaching reproductive age,well&hellip;. we&rsquo;ve all seen the third world poverty infomercials aimed at Caucasians.</p>
<p>No, once the grim living in Africa is replaced with calorie/fat laden food coupled with a sedentary lifestyle (courtesy of the welfare state) Africans balloon in size. </p>
<p>This is,of course, due to racism and a lack of &#8216;free health care&rsquo; which most black females enjoy anyway so as to further produce bastard offspring and increase their numbers.</p>
<p>By removing blacks from Africa and introducing the Western welfare state we have allowed the genie to escape from the bottle. </p>

			<p>The problem with the BMI is that it goes my weight/height.  A 5&rsquo;6&#8221; body builder with a size 30 inch waist who weighes the same as a 5&rsquo;6&#8221; fat slob who has a 36 inch waist are both written off as obese.</p>
<p>How the Stalinists can turn everything into a racial thing is beyond me.  Now we whites are responsible for how minorities eat. Do they want us to police that?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right; that would be racist.</p>
<p>The more you feed maggots, the more they eat so stop feeding them.  We are going to be called racist regardless so why bother trying to appease these animals.</p>

			<p>Governments tend to put out one-size-fits-all codes. BMI is marketing the latest height-weight formula as being more scientific than it really is. A government code has to be easy to calculate and having two inputs, height and weight, satisfies this criterion.</p>
<p>My best example is the rollover rating for SUV&rsquo;s. Briefly, auto companies put a lot of engineering into their suspensions to change their characteristics for various situations, including hard turning on flat road. But, since there was no simple formula for DYNAMIC rollover (what a SUV really does), the DOT simply ranked SUV&rsquo;s by their center-of-mass height divided by their wheel width (track). This is the STATIC rollover criterion and completely ignores the suspension design. So, simplisity triumphied once again.</p>
<p>I am happy to defend the US Government when it deserves it, but I am glad to be retired. Now, the Fishhook Turn Specification is a whole nother story&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
