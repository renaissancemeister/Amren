<h1><a href="http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/04/modern-european-fascism.html#readfurther">Modern European Fascism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Baron Bodissey, Gates of Vienna, April 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This is what real fascism looks like in Europe today.</p>
<p>Modern fascism does not originate on the right wing, nor does it involve neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>It arises within the ruling social democratic establishment, and its goal is the intimidation, harassment, and suppression of any organized opposition to its oligarchic rule. Its victims include any party that questions political correctness, Multiculturalism, mass immigration, or the supremacy of the European Union and its compliant functionaries within the &#8220;provinces&#8221; of Europe.</p>
<p>This is an account of the struggle of Vlaams Belang against the fascism of the Belgian state:</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m certain Obama, Pelosi, Reed and their hacks are looking closely at how Belgium and others have managed to squash the opposition and free speech in their countries.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be attempting to see what they can get away with over here.</p>
<p>Their enablers will probably be just like in Europe - the media and the publishers.</p>

			<p>I protest against communism being identified as fascism.<br>
Fascism was always a popular movement, not the top down rule by an oligarcy.</p>

			<p>I find it rather sad, the culture of self-entitlement that is alarmingly prevalent nowadays. </p>
<p>It also slightly angers me when people don&rsquo;t want to accept the fact that if they emigrate to a new country, they are subject to the new country&rsquo;s laws   &mdash;   including immigration laws. </p>

			<p>   It is happening in the U.K. now. The labour party and conservative party are in bed together to keep the BNP out of government. In the U.S. the democrats and republicans are the same party. In the aforementioned countries, and many others, freedom of speech is being stripped away from once free peoples. All in the name of One-world government. Europe has the EU to destroy the free peoples of Europe. The U.S. will have the North American Union to destroy it. The plans are being implemented as I write this comment. God help us all, we are in big trouble.</p>

			<p>Everybody seems to have a different idea of what &#8220;fascism&#8221; is, other than that it&rsquo;s supposed to be a really bad thing.  It would be most accurate to call the Belgian political establishment totalitarian.  They place no bounds on the power of the state, and brook no opposition.</p>
<p>Race realists are always called fascists by the left, even if they vote for the most libertarian, anti-government, pro-freedom, pro-peace, least fascist politician in office   &mdash;   Ron Paul.<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s really upsetting is that the majority of these jackboots are White men. How can they do this stuff to their own people? </p>

			<p>I will vote neither for Repubs or Dems, I will vote for Independent, Green, NAZI or anything but the same ol, same ol. AND I will vote AGAINST each and every encumbent politician and NO PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS. Lawyers should also stay out of politics, they can&rsquo;t be trusted any more than muslims.</p>

			<p>Socialism.</p>
<p>National Socialism.</p>
<p>Two sides of the same coin. Hatred, intolerance and violence are at the core of the philosophy. </p>
<p>Hatred of people who do not agree with them and a willingness to suspend Democracy and freedom of speech in order that the populace &#8220;submits&#8221; to their ways.</p>
<p>Just like Islam.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget - Hitler and the Nazi Party were very close allies with Radical Muslims in the Balkans who slaughtered tens of thousands of Serbian Christians. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem colluded with Hitler in Palestein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d51poygEXYU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d51poygEXYU</a></p>
<p>Socialist European leaders, together with your President Clinton, attacked the Serbs and threw them out of their Kosovan homeland. Now the churches are either rubble or mosques. The graveyards are being paved over for car parks.</p>
<p>Now Islam is in the ascendant. Christianity has been trashed.</p>
<p>Why is it that Socialists cosy up to Islamists all the time? Why do the hate the indiginous European people?</p>

<p>I believe the answer is in the actions of the Belgian state in the video. The neo-Marxists who control the EU are aware that sites like Amren, BNP and other nationalist sites on the Internet are awakening millions of slumbering white people to the fact that they are being dispossessed of their European states by the neo-Marxist EU elite. Their campaign is in overdrive and they are desperate to make multiculturalism by mass immigration into Europe irreversible before they are kicked from office and have to face the wrath of the betrayed European peoples. If one state breaks away others will follow and the EU is finished. In the video you see the totalitarian behaviour of the Belgian state which is a puppet of the neo-Marxist EU. Islam is also a totalitarian ideology and that is what these two seemingly opposites have in common. These two totalitarian systems and their stooges hate the freedom that epitomises Western civilisation and wish to destroy European nation-states.  <br>

			<p>As one of the commentators on the video rightly points out, the writings of &#8220;Fjordman&#8221;, especially his &#8220;Defeating Eurabia&#8221; blogs on the Gates of Vienna website, are essential reading for anyone who wants to understand WHAT is currently happening in Europe and WHY.</p>
