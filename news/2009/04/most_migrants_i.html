<h1><a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4082&amp;Alias=wzo&amp;cob=405775">Most Migrants in Vienna Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wiener Zeitung, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A report issued by the Ministry of Education states that almost all students are migrants in a fifth of primary schools in some Vienna districts. The 474-page report, issued in response to 69 parliamentary questions by Freedom Party (FPÃ–) education spokesman Walter Rosenkranz, defines migrant students as those who are foreigners or whose mother tongue is not German. The report says migrants make up 90 per cent of the total number of students at 8.1 per cent of the capital&rsquo;s 262 primary schools, compared to one per cent for Austria as a whole, and are almost a majority (49.6 per cent on average) in half of city schools. Leopoldstadt is the district with the highest percentage (60.9 per cent), followed by Brigittenau (58.6 per cent). In Vienna, one-third of all students are migrants at 59.8 per cent of city schools, compared to 13.7 per cent in the entire country. Overall, Vienna has 40.4 per cent of Austria&rsquo;s migrant students, with Vorarlberg next with 19.6 per cent.<br>

			<p>This is no surprise at all. I moved to Vienna a few months ago and still to this day can&rsquo;t get over how many foreigners there are here. It doesn&rsquo;t take a mathematician to put these numbers together and figure out how&rsquo;s it going to be in 20, 30, 50 years from now. As with many Europeans, Viennese are more preoccupied with their careers than having kids. Same old story everywhere, the women pushing strollers around with 2 or 3 other kids in tow are invariably the Turks, Asians, and Africans.</p>

			<p>Vienna actually has pretty good quality immigrants compared to the rest of europe.  Night and day compared to paris.  Loads of seemingly educated asians/orientals.</p>

			<p>The majority of people live in Vienna, almost 2 million out of 8 million people in Austria.</p>

			<p>This is a bummer, especially the first comment. I was seriously considering moving to Austria with my family as a back up plan. I thought it wasn&rsquo;t swamped. The 2008 demographic states make Austria sound good, I guess they were wrong. Anyone else with any insight or experience?</p>

<p>(I am the poster of the first comment). By European standards I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s much better than many other cities, it probably hasn&rsquo;t got a patch on London or Frankfurt etc, I can only judge it on its own right not compared to other European cities I haven&rsquo;t lived in, and to me it&rsquo;s pretty bad. I don&rsquo;t know, to others it might seem relatively foreigner-free!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about them being educated. A lot of them look like they have no business being here (ie dressed like they just got smuggled here in the back of some truck), I would say there are a lot of hard working eastern Europeans, even though many don&rsquo;t bother to learn the language and are responsible for increasing levels of crime as unemployment worsens, but at least after a generation or two they integrate a lot better than Asians/Arabs etc.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds, at least from a racial viewpoint.  The vast majority of these people are from the area that used to be called Yugoslavia.  There also are alot of other Europeans in Geneva.  The most visible nonwhite minority group is the Turks.  There are a few orientals too but judging by the ages I saw they were probably exchange students or technology spies. </p>

<p>I would have to see that to believe it, I would believe that the place is being over run with North African muslims first.</p>

<p>The most visible WHITE minority group is the KURDS. Being Muslim doesn&rsquo;t change their race&hellip;</p>
<p>Asians are mostly students (or better technology spies), they also form the majority of foreign students in Germany.</p>
<p>Here, it&rsquo;s forbidden to foreigners to work on weekends in the laboratories at the uni. Last year, one copied many documents of greater importance and sent to China in a USB stick.</p>

<p>The definition of White means Europid.  Kurds, like Turks are Asians not Europeans.  There are alot of Turks in the major cities and they&rsquo;re easily distinguishable from the native populations.  Maybe the largest group is Kurds, I don&rsquo;t know.  Kurds and Turks, to me, look almost identical.</p>

<p>It DOES change their agenda and intentions towards those of us who are NOT muslims, there is no room for non-muslims in a muslim world. Believe in god or not, athiest or not, there is NO ROOM for you either in a muslim world.</p>
