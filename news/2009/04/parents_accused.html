<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/email/idUSTRE53M5I920090423">Parents Accused of Taking Children on Burglary</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, April 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mother was accused on Wednesday of driving a getaway minivan with her two young children inside after burglaries at two New York City homes.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Erika Santana, 23, drove the van with her four-year-old and five-month-old children inside after Hugo Lantigua, 22, who is the baby&rsquo;s father, and Pedro Camillo, 19, broke into two houses in the borough of Queens.</p>
<p>Santana, Lantigua and Camillo face charges including burglary, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child, and face up to 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unthinkable that a mother and father would put their children in harm&rsquo;s way while allegedly committing these crimes. It is even more unimaginable that they would allegedly do so with a loaded handgun in their vehicle,&#8221; Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said.<br>

			<p>Loaded handgun? That is the problem? Yeah, those loaded handguns in vehicles, those are ruining society.</p>

			<p>This story can&rsquo;t be true. After all, George W. Bush repeatedly spoke of &#8220;hispanic family values&#8221; and the head of the Republican Party called latinos &#8220;America&rsquo;s most conservative ethnic group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, years ago Karl Rove advocated forcing banks to give latins subprime mortgage loans on the theory that they&rsquo;d be so grateful they would switch to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s that working out?  </p>

			<p>At a gas station in El Cerrito CA last year someone was robbed at gunpoint by a Hispanic man who drove up in an SUV with a baby sitting in a car seat. I wonder if the kid was his or just happened to come with the vehicle when he carjacked it.</p>

			<p>This actually happens here in Southern California all the time. The police routinely arrest Latino criminals who have their wives and/or children with them. One of the more notable incidents was at the L.A. Airport when a car burglary ring was finally caught in the act. The criminals were bringing their children with them. They probably felt it made them look less suspicious as they drove into the airport. But some of the criminals were showing their kids how to steal. The cops caught one of the men showing a youngster of 7 or 8 how to break into a car. Hispanic Family Values. Coming to your town sooner than you think. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;This actually happens here in Southern California all the time&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the schools too.</p>
<p>The school police tell me a favorite criminal MO is to have a kid jam a door or window latch with a small piece of paper or a straw during the day so when the older relatives come back later (with the kid, of course) the door or window is already open.</p>
<p>Entire computer labs have been cleaned out this way.</p>
<p>The other after-hours activity the thieves are fond of is to pull a very small vent off of the outside of a classroom and push a small child through the opening so the kid can then open the door and his relatives can make off with taxpayer-funded electronic equipment  &mdash;  laptops being the current object of desire (many classrooms contain 30 or more laptops).  One of my colleagues lost two sets before she started  taking them home each night in her van and locking them in her garage.</p>
<p>Of course, most thefts in the schools (and there are A LOT of them) are after-hours, inside jobs.  I&rsquo;ve never known of a White who held any after-school position  &mdash;  security guard, janitor or groundskeeper  &mdash;  they are reserved strictly for non-Whites, all of whom have master keys.</p>
