<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immighealth27-2009apr27,0,1639782,full.story">California Counties Cut Healthcare to Illegal Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Forced to slash their budgets, some California counties are eliminating nonemergency health services for illegal immigrants  &mdash;  a move that officials acknowledge could backfire by shifting the financial burden to emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Sacramento County voted in February to bar illegal immigrants from county clinics at an estimated savings of $2.4 million. Contra Costa County followed last month by cutting off undocumented adults, to save approximately $6 million. And Yolo County is voting on a similar change next month, which would reduce costs by $1.2 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walker said the national ambivalence on immigration policy means that illegal immigrants are living here but without federal or state funding to provide essential medical services to them. Walker, who began his medical career treating undocumented farmworkers, said that deciding to cut their services was difficult.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Trend could spread</b></p>
<p>As the recession continues, property tax revenue decreases and the number of newly uninsured patients increases, other county health departments in California and the nation may make similar changes, said Robert Pestronk, executive director of the National Assn. of County and City Health Officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Schunhoff, Los Angeles County&rsquo;s interim health services department director, said there is no plan to eliminate health services to the county&rsquo;s illegal residents, despite significant projected deficits and concern about further cuts in state funding.</p>
<p>Eliminating illegal immigrants from health services may enable counties to balance their budgets this year but won&rsquo;t solve the problem in the long term, said David Hayes-Bautista, professor of medicine and director of UCLA&rsquo;s Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And study after study shows that illegal immigrants are less likely than U.S.-born residents to go to the doctor or seek regular medical care, he said.</p>
<p>Anti-illegal immigration activist Barbara Coe said she was thrilled that counties are beginning to restrict services. Coe&rsquo;s group, California Coalition for Immigration Reform, sponsored Proposition 187, the initiative that tried to bar the state from providing public services to illegal immigrants before it died in federal court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the policy changes have angered immigrant rights advocates, who argue that restrictions could also cause a chilling effect on legal residents and U.S. citizens in mixed-status families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even those people who qualify to get care won&rsquo;t,&#8221; said Reshma Shamasunder, director of the California Immigrant Policy Center.</p>
<p>Shamasunder also said that denying healthcare to one segment of the population puts everyone else at risk as communicable diseases go untreated and emergency rooms become even more crowded.</p>
<p>Jose Suarez, who has asthma, said he now plans to go to the hospital if he gets sick. Suarez, 25, was born in Mexico but has been living in Contra Costa County for 10 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Few options</b></p>
<p>Marina Espinoza, also an illegal immigrant in Contra Costa County, said she visits a county clinic a few times a month to monitor her diabetes and high blood pressure so that she doesn&rsquo;t end up in the hospital. Espinoza is considering returning to Mexico, where a relative has a lead on a job with health insurance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before changing its policy on illegal immigrants, Sacramento County took several other steps to reduce healthcare costs, including closing three of its six clinics. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough, said Keith Andrews, chief of primary health services in the Department of Health and Human Services. Andrews said he was left with a choice between firing staff or reducing the number of patients. The county is continuing to treat everyone for communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Andrews said about 4,000 people without legal residency or citizenship were receiving healthcare in the county. Although some are immigrants who have lived and worked in the area for years, he said, others are foreign natives who came to the county to receive free medical treatment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Seeking solutions</b></p>
<p>In Contra Costa County, which will continue treating undocumented children and pregnant women, community groups mobilized against the proposal. They helped persuade county officials to allocate additional funds to the nonprofit community clinics to help treat the 5,500 undocumented patients who will no longer be eligible for county services.</p>
<p>Those patients will receive primary care at the clinics, but they won&rsquo;t have a place to go if they need to see a specialist, such as for cancer or heart problems.</p>

			<p>Subsidizing the underclass, be it legals or illegals is like a pyramid scheme for failure. Subsidizing will only increase their numbers which will only require more subsidy. This cycle will continue until the taxpayer can&rsquo;t afford to subsidize the underclass any longer and the system collapses. Good intentions can have disastrous results in the long run sometimes.</p>

			<p>It is unfortunate that we can&rsquo;t make health care a human right, but we can&rsquo;t. With millions of Americans without health care, we need to focus on them and not illegal aliens. Compassion has nothing to do with it. The presence of illegal aliens is at the expense of citizens and any pleas for sympathy for a sick illegal alien serve to deprive those citizens of help they might get instead. Why this has been allowed to go on for so long is impossible to understand.</p>

			<p>I cannot fathom why illegal aliens who given emergency medical treatment, which is alright if it is needed to save their lives, are not immediately afterward photographed, billed, and then deported, and not legally permitted into this country until they have paid the bill entirely.</p>

<p>If illegals are living here without federal or state funding to provide essential medical services, how can these medical services be cut? They&rsquo;re not getting them, right? Am I missing something? </p>

			<p>I am glad to hear this   &mdash;   it is certainly about time.  What I would like to see is the emergency rooms cut off the non-emergency treatment.  I know by federal dictate they have to treat them for life threatening emergencies however they should be promptly shown the door if it is not an emergency.  Illegals always have money to send back to their home country but never any to pay their medical bills.  </p>

			<p>I feel very sorry for the white people of USA and Western Europe that are becoming minorities in their own countries. Invasion of third worlders is totally disgusting and unnatural for me. <br>
Sincerely I can understand that corporations and other companies hire CONTRACTORS that work TEMPORARILY in USA/EU, but why are the governments letting the asylum seekers in? Why do they reveive citizenships, right to vote, free housing, medical care? I mean people who often can&rsquo;t read, write, have HIV/AIDS, other illnesses, are aggressive and hostile, commit crimes. Why are these people allowed to pollute the 1st world?</p>

<p>How noble of John! </p>
<p>Just get back to us in less than a year&rsquo;s time after the &#8220;funneling&#8221; effect has taken hold of your county due to the more sensible county health directors throughout California having followed suit to cut services to illegal aliens.   </p>

<p>Contra Costa County is also refusing to prosecute some drug crimes, several misdeanors, and even a few felonies, because they no longer have the manpower to handle the work load.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had to lay off several people, because of a serious shortfall in revenue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to see this occur throughout many different counties across the country, just as many people predicted, which is a giant step toward third world status.</p>

<p>Couple this occurence with releasing inmates in prisons to cut costs, and California could be heading for some very high crime figures.</p>

			<p>Let the Hispanic community found hospitals to take care of their own, as the did the Irish Catholics, the Presbyterians, and the Jews. Oh, I forgot. That pesky amoral familism, not to mention the fact that Hispanics send any money they have left out of the country. When it comes to Hispanics and charity, always a recipient, never a benefactor be.</p>

			<p>I am skeptical of policies like these making a significant difference in the long term.  There is simply no incentive for the aliens to leave.  Even the most poverty-stricken American city has a far higher standard of living than much of Mexico or Central America.        </p>

			<p>I hate to say it, but the only way anything will be done about immigration is for the economy to decline further.  Prosperity promotes insouciance.  People need to get scared.  Terrified even.  If whites knew what they were in store for over the next few decades, they&rsquo;d undock their keisters, flip off the TV, and get over to their congressmen&rsquo;s office, pronto.  Things would get done.  But the politicians know that most whites would rather worry about &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221;, while hispanics would take to the streets in a heartbeat, and take their votes to whichever candidate supports their side. It&rsquo;s politics as usual, sadly.  I have a feeling whites will wake up at the conclusion of the Obama presidency to a whole new America.</p>

			<p>Of course they aren&rsquo;t going to cut back services in LA for illegal aliens&hellip;&hellip;.there are so many of them, there would be massive demonstrations, if not rioting, so better to keep paying for them than risk the consequences. </p>
<p>Since the federal government keeps statistics on just about everything, too bad they don&rsquo;t keep track of all the medical bills the illegals rack up at taxpayer expense. They ought to add it all up and send Mexico the bill for taking care of their illegal immigrant freeloaders.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigrants (&#8216;asylum-seekers&rsquo;) entering Australia by boat from Indonesia, after passing through several Muslim countries where they could have claimed asylum, have instant access to Newstart, the adult migrant English program, youth allowances, the age pension, family tax benefit, and childcare benefits. Not to mention medical care, travel rights and the opportunity to sponsor their families through the Offshore Humanitarian Program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, disadvantaged Australians and aged pensioners can wait for 7-10 years for subsidised housing, and are often placed on a waiting list for surgery and dental care.</p>
<p>The present idiot government abolished TPVs (Temporary Protection Visas) last august, resulting in a flood of illegals in leaky boats. </p>
<p>A win for the shrill &#8216;asylum-seeker&rsquo; industry at the expense of all Australians. Illegals detained on Christmas Island are eating better than the locals - thanks to Australian taxpayers.</p>
<p>The US isn&rsquo;t the only country where asylum shoppers are treated better than citizens. </p>

			<p>During times of drastic economic downturns, coupled with burdensome times, conservative opinions and attitudes reappear as dominant.  Religion becomes more prevalent in family life.  Family values, as opposed to individualism, reemerge as the best insurance policy to help defeat poverty and stagnation.  Tightening the belt, not only occurs in the home, but in government social programs as well.  Public coffers shrink and those deemed too &#8220;liberal&#8221; will feel the ax first.  Pet projects of the rich and famous, such as gay marriage and appeals to overseas welfare/food programs, take a back seat to the more obvious plight of the majority of Americans.   Mia Farrow&rsquo;s current hunger strike to bring attention to starvation in Darfur, will not get the attention it may have a few years ago.  And if things get worse, many will simply say go ahead and starve yourself Mia, who cares, more food for us.  Granted, we are not there yet.  And in some respects I&rsquo;m not so sure I want us to get to depression era status among the social enclaves, but if we do, one can be assured that a proportionate effect will be a return toward conservative viewpoints, not the least of which would be an America first attitude among its citizens.  </p>

<p>This move won&rsquo;t bother the illegal border jumpers in the least. Those of us that are familiar with their practices KNOW that they NEVER go to a doctor, no matter what, they go to the ER and usually the entire family is in tow. Since the entire family is there, why not complain about everything and get free drugs!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;others are foreign natives who came to the county to receive free medical treatment&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement just frosts me.</p>
<p>According to Dan Stein of FAIR, in California:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the costs of illegal immigration have grown geometrically, while the state has spiraled into a fiscal crisis that has brought it near bankrupt&hellip; the average native-born family in California gets handed a nearly $1,200 a year bill.. $1.4 billion of the taxpayers&rsquo; money goes toward providing health care to illegal aliens and their families&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the schools, I have seen many illegal families bring their sick or disabled child (or children) to the US specifically to take advantage of free healthcare and other services that are not available in their home countries.  </p>
<p>The disabled child is instantly eligible for life-long free medical care costing US taxpayers billions of dollars.  The costs of their schooling is approximately double that of regular children because of the special services the state mandates they receive  &mdash;  small classes, adapted buses, aides, nurses  &mdash;  until they are 22 years old.<br>
Special education costs are breaking the backs of many school districts.</p>
<p>Also, translation services must be provided in the schools, courts and hospitals and many of the newest immigrants are 4 ft. 10 in. indians that do not speak English or Spanish.  Often translations must be made from English to Spanish to Mixtec or Nauhtl.</p>
<p>As the legislature raises taxes yet again on California&rsquo;s producers, and imposes ever more punitive regulations and oversights on businesses, California&rsquo;s taxpayers will continue to flee, the downward spiral will continue and the quality of life in the Golden State will deteriorate further.</p>

			<p>Glendale, California, has especially good programs for Special Ed.  The kids are almost all immigrants, and most of them live in apartments.  That means that the Whites who own the houses and pay most of the taxes are providing very expensive day care for foreign retarded and disturbed children who moved there just to get into the local system.  The situation of the kids is sad, and I don&rsquo;t blame the parents for taking advantage, but why is it the responsibility of Whites to take care of Korea&rsquo;s and Armenia&rsquo;s and the Phillipines&rsquo; damaged children?  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll keep posting these things.  </p>
<p>Whites need to be aware that affirmative action is coming to health care.  The medical and nursing schools and medical establishment is brainwashing young physicians to favor non whites just as the law school profs brainwashed young law students now Judges to favor non whites 2 generations ago.</p>
<p>Here it is, the latest anti white medical program.</p>
<p>       THE CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESEARCH</p>
<p>The CVRP is presenting seminars &#8220;Voices of Vlunerable Populations in Health Disparities Research&#8221;</p>
<p>Speakers will yammer on and on about how illegal hispanics don&rsquo;t get enough health care. I haven&rsquo;t yet heard Tim Wise&rsquo;s term White Privilege yet, but that&rsquo;s what they mean. </p>
<p>Whites have some sort of demonic, satanic power that keeps us healthy, just as our poor white children on welfare have satanic, demonic powers that enable them to stay our of Juvenile prisons and complete high school easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange.  The hospitals are always complaining that medi-caid and other government programs pay only 10 percent of the actual cost of care.</p>
<p>Yet the health care industry wants more and more health care for illegal hispanics who pay either nothing or have some sort of government plan like medi-caid that pays only 10 percent months after the treatment.</p>
<p>One of the workshops will be &#8220;obesity prevalance in latino chiildren.&#8221;  It is true.  Latino children are total butterballs compared to any other ethnic group.  </p>
<p>Why?  Let&rsquo;s see, WIC coupons as soon as the pregnancy test is positive.  WIC coupons and food stamps until age 5.  Food stamps at home and free school breakfast, lunch and after school snack until high school graduation.  During the summer hispanic kids get free breakfast, lunch and snacks in the parks and playgrounds.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be obese too if I had a life time of free food behind me.</p>
<p>As more and more Asian physicians steal jobs and med school places from white men, expect more and more of this.</p>
<p>The white female physicians and nurses, especially the older nurses who run the nursing associations are in the forefront of the affirmative action for non whites in health care movement.</p>

<p>They also get $770.00 per month in SSI disability benefits per child.  They get these benefits until they die.  Low IQ is considered a disability and cause for life long benefits.<br>
