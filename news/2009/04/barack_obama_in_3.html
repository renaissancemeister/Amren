<h1>Barack Obama in His Own Words (Part III of III)</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Henderson, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>Part I, available <a href="/news/2009/03/barack_obama_in_1.html" target="part1" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here,</b></a> described how Barack Obama has agonized over his multi-racial identity. Part II, available <a href="/news/2009/04/barack_obama_in_2.html" target="part2" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here,</b></a> explored his deep resentment of whites, including his white mother and grandparents.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s ethnic interests are selective. He worries constantly about the &#8220;brothers and sisters,&#8221; but shows little concern for any other group. He mentions Latinos briefly but always in the context of how they have linked their cause to that of blacks. There are also a few token waves at various types of Asians.</p>
<p>The one group whose ethnic interests he never considers is whites. He shows no awareness that they have any ethnic interest, at least none they have any right to defend. Early on in AOH (pp.&nbsp;36&#150;37.) he makes this claim:<blockquote>The victories that the sixties generation brought about  &mdash;  the admission of minorities and women into full citizenship, the strengthening of individual liberties and the healthy willingness to question authority  &mdash;  have made America a far better place for all its citizens. <br>
</blockquote>Better for all? The &#8220;victories&#8221; of the sixties ushered in racial preferences that deny opportunities to whites. They brought about an immigration policy that is reducing whites to a minority. They required whites, especially men, to bow the knee to all sorts of insults about their motives, their history, and their very legitimacy. But whites, of course, have no interests, so all this is invisible to Mr. Obama.</p>
<p>Sometimes his obtuseness to white thinking is astonishing. In AOH, he writes, &#8220;The process by which I was selected as the keynote speaker [at the 2004 Democratic Convention] remains something of a mystery to me.&#8221; (AOH p354.)</p>
<p>A mystery? How can it not have occurred to him that he was chosen for one reason only: he was that great rarity, a black senator. One wonders whether Mr. Obama actually believe what he writes about race or simply uses race as a means to power.</p>
<p><b>Political Adversaries</b></p>
<p>When Mr. Obama&rsquo;s ran for the Senate the Republicans put up a black candidate, Alan Keyes, to oppose him. Mr. Obama claims that &#8220;one Republican colleague of mine in the state senate provided me with a blunt explanation of their strategy: &#8216;We got our own Harvard-educated conservative black guy to go up against the Harvard-educated liberal black guy. He may not win, but at least he can knock that halo off your head.&rsquo;&#8221; (AOH, p.&nbsp;209.)</p>
<p>Whether or not that was the strategy it certainly flustered Mr. Obama. First, he could not play the race card. Secondly, he had an opponent who was not afraid to attack him personally. Here is a sample:<blockquote>Alan Keyes, deployed a novel argument for attracting voters in the waning days of the campaign. &#8220;Christ would not vote for Barack Obama,&#8221; Mr. Keyes proclaimed, &#8220;because Barack Obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved.&#8221; (AOH p.&nbsp;209.) <br>
</blockquote>Mr. Keyes was probably referring to support for abortion rights, but Mr. Obama does not say. But perhaps most cruelly, Mr. Keyes played the reverse race card as it were:<blockquote>There was no doubt that the man could talk. At the drop of a hat Mr. Keyes could deliver a grammatically flawless disquisition on virtually any topic. On the stump, he could wind himself into a fiery intensity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He accused me of taking a &#8220;slaveholder&rsquo;s position&#8221; in my defense of abortion rights and called me a core, academic Marxist&#8221; for my support of universal health and other social programs  &mdash;  and then added for good measure that because I was not the descendant of slaves I was not really African American. (AOH p.&nbsp;210.)<br>
</blockquote>Mr. Obama did not know how to respond. In an unusual admission of defeat he writes:<blockquote>And yet, as the campaign progressed, I found him getting under my skin in a way that few people ever have. When our paths crossed during the campaign, I often had to suppress the rather uncharitable urge to either taunt him or wring his neck. Once, when we bumped into each other at an Indian Independence Day parade, I poked him in the chest while making a point, a bit of alpha-male behavior that I hadn&rsquo;t engaged in since high school and which an observant news crew gamely captured; the moment was replayed in slow motion on TV that evening. In the three debates that were held before the election, I was frequently tongue-tied, irritable, and uncharacteristically tense  &mdash;  a fact that the public (having by that point written Mr. Keyes off) largely missed, but one that caused no small bit of distress to some of my supporters. &#8220;Why are you letting this guy give you fits?&#8221; they would ask me. For them, Mr. Keyes was a kook, an extremist, his arguments not even worth entertaining. (AOH p.&nbsp;211.)<br>
</blockquote>This political pantomime of putting up a black to fight a black has its comical side, and I suspect Mr. Obama will be rattled again by Michael Steele, the newly appointed first black leader of the Republican Party, or any other black person who challenges him. But it is also a pitiful thing that no white mainstream politician would tackle Mr. Obama honestly.</p>
<p>Near the end of the 2008 campaign for president, some of John McCain&rsquo;s advisors told him his only chance of beating Mr. Obama was to spend his remaining television money reminding voters of his opponent&rsquo;s close ties with Jeremiah Wright. Mr. McCain refused to take this advice for fear he would be accused of &#8220;playing the race card.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect that anyone who really went after Mr. Obama would find he has a very thin skin. He has not been toughened because he has always had a smooth ride both from the media and political opponents.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has rarely met with mainstream political or media opposition, and he handles it badly. In this passage he is reacting to criticism for making a speech about free expression that implied he might not be entirely unsympathetic to some form of censorship:<blockquote>You would have thought I was Cotton Mather. In response to my speech, one newspaper editorial intoned that the government had no business regulating protected speech, despite the fact that I hadn&rsquo;t called for regulation. Reporters suggested that I was cynically tacking to the center in preparation for a national race. More than a few supporters wrote our office, complaining that they had voted for me to beat back the Bush agenda, not to act as the town scold. (AOH p.&nbsp;61.) <br>
</blockquote>In April 2005, Mr. Obama wrote an article for <cite>Time</cite> in which he noted that &#8220;in Lincoln&rsquo;s rise from poverty, his mastery of language and law, his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat  &mdash;  in all this, he reminded me not just of my own struggles.&#8221; He thought highly enough of this sentence to repeat it in <cite>The Audacity of Hope</cite> (AOH pp.&nbsp;122&#150;23) and records his astonishment to find that journalist Peggy Noonan was not impressed. He quotes her as follows:<blockquote>&#8220;This week comes the previously careful Sen. Barack Obama, flapping his wings in <cite>Time</cite> Magazine and explaining that he&rsquo;s a lot like Abraham Lincoln, only sort of better.&#8221; She went on to say, &#8220;There is nothing wrong with Barack Obama&rsquo;s resume, but it is a log-cabin-free zone. So far it is also a greatness-free zone. If he keeps talking about himself like this it always will be.&#8221; (AOH p 123)<br>
</blockquote>Mr. Obama has a high opinion of his wife, Michelle, too  &mdash;  so high it begins to sound suspicious:<blockquote>Most people who meet my wife quickly conclude that she is remarkable. They are right about this  &mdash;  she is smart, funny, and roughly charming. She is also very beautiful, although not in way that men find intimidating or women find off-putting; it is the lived-in beauty of the mother and busy professional rather than the touched-up image we see on the cover of glossy magazines. Often, after hearing her speak at some function or working with her on a project, people will approach me and say something to the effect of &#8220;You know I think the world of you, Barack, but your wife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wow! (AOH p.&nbsp;327.) <br>
</blockquote>We also learn that &#8220;her employers loved her, and everyone remarked on what a good mother she was.&#8221; (AOH p.&nbsp;341.)</p>
<p>Needless to say, only a supremely attractive and wonderful man could get such a beautiful and talented woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama devotes a chapter of AOH to his family, and he seems more than ordinarily keen to acknowledge his wife&rsquo;s support as a wife and mother. Page after page is filled with minute details about how Michelle organizes the house, arranges children&rsquo;s parties, etc. Here is a sample of his minutely tedious description of his family life&#8221;<blockquote>When I can, I volunteer to help, which Michelle appreciates, although she is careful to limit my responsibilities. The day before Sasha&rsquo;s birthday party this past June, I was told to procure twenty balloons, enough cheese pizza to feed twenty kids, and ice. This seemed manageable, so when Michelle told me that she was going to get goody bags to hand out at the end of the party, I suggested that I do that as well. She laughed. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t handle goody bags,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let me explain the goody bag thing. You have to go into the party store and choose the bags. Then you have to choose what to put in the bags, and what is in the boys&rsquo; bags has to be different from what is in the girls&rsquo; bags. You&rsquo;d walk in there and wander around the aisles for an hour, and then your head would explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling less confident, I got on the Internet. I found a place that sold balloons near the gymnastics studio where the party would be held, and a pizza place that promised delivery at 3:45 p.m. By the time the guests showed up the next day, the balloons were in place and the juice boxes were on ice. I sat with the other parents, catching up and watching twenty or so five-year-olds run and jump and bounce on the equipment like a band of merry elves. I had a slight scare when at 3:50 the pizzas had not yet arrived but the delivery person got there ten minutes before the children were scheduled to eat. Michelle&rsquo;s brother, Craig, knowing the pressure I was under, gave me a high five. Michelle looked up from putting pizza on paper plates and smiled.</p>
<p>As a grand finale, after all the pizza was eaten and the juice boxes drunk, after we had sung &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; and eaten some cake, the gymnastics instructor gathered all the kids around an old, multicolored parachute and told Sasha to sit at its center. (AOH pp.&nbsp;349&#150;50.)<br>
</blockquote>One gets the impression that it is Michelle wears the trousers, which suggests Mr. Obama is something of a subordinate personality. Subordinates should never be in positions of power because they are inherently weak and prone both to making no decision when one is needed and being pushed into reckless decisions because of a lack of will.</p>
<p><b>The Obama Intellect</b></p>
<p>Mr. Obama is always portrayed as highly intelligent, though this is not readily apparent from his books. DMF is essentially a prolonged retailing of racial anxiety and victimhood. These subjects are largely expressions of emotion and do not test the intellect. The book says little about Mr. Obama&rsquo;s views on non-racial matters.</p>
<p>AOH is different. Here Mr. Obama does address matters of policy, but he still cannot do so without a fair bit of DMF-style agonizing. The problem is that when Mr. Obama deals with policy he trots out cliché after cliché and often fails to come to any conclusion. Reading AOH is like being locked into an interminable <cite>Guardian</cite> editorial (<cite>The Guardian</cite> is the leading liberal left paper in Britain): on the one hand this, on the other hand that, on the third hand this. Here is a good example in a speech he gave on freedom of expression:<blockquote>I recently gave a speech at the Kaiser Foundation after they released a study showing that the amount of sex on television had doubled in recent years. Now, I enjoy HBO as much as the next guy, and I generally don&rsquo;t care what adults watch in the privacy of their homes. In the case of children, I think it&rsquo;s primarily the duty of parents to monitor what they are watching on television, and in my speech I even suggested that everyone would benefit if parents  &mdash;  heaven forbid  &mdash;  simply turned off the TV and tried to strike up a conversation with their kids.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I indicated that I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with ads for erectile-dysfunction drugs popping up every fifteen minutes whenever I watched a football game with my daughters in the room. I offered the further observation that a popular show targeted at teens, in which young people with no visible means of support spend several months getting drunk and jumping naked into hot tubs with strangers, was not &#8220;the real world.&#8221; I ended by suggesting that the broadcast and cable industries should adopt better standards and technology to help parents control what streamed into their homes. (AOH pp.&nbsp;60&#150;61.)<br>
</blockquote>A United States senator might be expected to have firm views, but this type of flaccid waffling is classic Obama. He neither defends free speech nor advocates censorship.&nbsp;Instead he offers the non-solution of self-policing.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s specialty is supposed to be constitutional law, but even on this subject he is capable of nothing more original than this passage:<blockquote>When we get in a tussle about abortion or flag burning, we appeal to a higher authority  &mdash;  the Founding Fathers and the Constitution&rsquo;s ratifiers  &mdash;  to give us more direction. Some, like Justice Scalia, conclude that the original understanding must be followed and that if we strictly obey this rule, then democracy is respected. Others, like Justice Breyer, don&rsquo;t dispute that the original meaning of constitutional provisions matters. But they insist that sometimes the original understanding can take you only so far  &mdash;  that on the truly hard cases, the truly big arguments, we have to take context, history, and the practical outcomes of a decision into account. According to this view, the Founding Fathers and original ratifiers have told us how to think but are no longer around to tell us <em>what</em> to think. We are on our own, and have only our own reason and our judgment to rely on. (AOH p.&nbsp;89.)<br>
</blockquote>Here is Mr. Obama doing his &#8220;on the one hand this, on the other hand that&#8221; routine, but he does take a position. &#8220;Ultimately, though, I have to side with Justice Breyer&rsquo;s view of the Constitution  &mdash;  that it is not a static but rather a living document and must be read in the context of an ever-changing world.&#8221; (AOH p.&nbsp;90.)</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Obama wants the Constitution to mean whatever he thinks it should mean.</p>
<p>As for his admission to Harvard Law School, the racial preferences granted to blacks are well known, and any black Harvard graduate is sure to get a job as a lawyer. He is surprisingly reticent about this part of his career, however, even though he often boasts about other aspects of his life. One wonders just how successful he was. He does make clear that his work was about black victimhood, suing companies and public bodies for violation of civil rights. Such cases are favored by judges in politically correct America. Nor is it very clear why he decided to drop this career.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s decision to re-take the oath of office after he and the chief justice muffed their lines at the inauguration takes on a certain interest in light of recent revelations that he is more dependent on teleprompters than any previous president  &mdash;  he cannot even manage a six-minute talk without this crutch. Here is a man who clearly wants everything scripted, right down to the last comma. This helps explain why he had so much trouble debating Mr. Keyes.</p>
<p>The manner in which he re-took the oath is curious. There were no cameras present, and he did not take the oath on the Bible. The Constitution does not require a Bible, but this was an odd choice for a man who was persistently battling claims he is a closet Muslim. The official explanation for the absence of a Bible was that none could be found in the White House  &mdash;  again, a curious state of affairs for someone who claims to be an ardent churchgoer.</p>
<p>Whatever Mr. Obama&rsquo;s writing may say about his intellect, it is full of passages he clearly thinks are examples of &#8220;writing&#8221;:<blockquote>Old faces and young faces all glow like jack-o-lanterns in the shifting lamplight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (DMF p.&nbsp;389.)</p>
<p>Perhaps I just find the ways of the heart too various, and my own life too imperfect, to believe myself qualified to serve as anyone&rsquo;s moral arbiter. (AOH p.&nbsp;336.)</p>
<p>I know that tucking in my daughters that night, I grasped a little bit of Heaven. (AOH p.&nbsp;226.)<br>
</blockquote>This sort of thing is less a sign of real intellect than of trying too hard.</p>
<p> Another way to judge a man&rsquo;s intellect is to look at what he has actually achieved. Mr. Obama has been immensely successful in gaining high position but once in them he has done nothing considerable. Peggy Noonan&rsquo;s passage quoted above about the &#8220;greatness-free zone&#8221; is still true. We have yet to know the results of his presidency, but his record up until his inauguration is very close to zero.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Obama&rsquo;s own description of his few years as a community organizer is a litany of failure. He is constantly trying out initiatives that fail; he organizes meetings to which few people come; his attempts to deal with local politicians and bureaucrats bear no fruit; even his relationships with the &#8220;brothers&#8221; and &#8220;sisters&#8221; are far from smooth.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s second careers as an academic and lawyer are also curiously lackluster. He produces no academic work of note nor acts in any significant legal cases.</p>
<p>When Mr. Obama gets his foot on the political ladder in the Illinois legislature he is bored with local politics and does nothing of note. His transition to the Senate has also resulted in a legislative career of stunning banality.</p>
<p>There are two other points worth noting. Before becoming president he never held an executive position. Nor has he held any of his jobs for very long; his longest stint is as a part-time academic. That is reminiscent of his father and maternal grandfather, who were never able to stick to anything.</p>
<p><b>The Peculiarity of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Election</b></p>
<p>To understand how odd Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election was, one need only imagine a white politician who was equally obsessed about race, but from a white point of view  &mdash;  if it is even possible to imagine such a person. He would not have managed to get into the intellectual mainstream, let alone be elected to public office. We can certainly wonder, however, what a man who is deeply suspicious and resentful of whites will do as president.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s racial paranoia and deep-dyed sense of victimhood should have been enough to disqualify him as president, but DMF and AOH provide evidence of other character defects that also make him a dangerous choice.</p>
<p>The man is insecure. He is constantly scrutinizing his behavior and wondering how others respond to him, and constantly wavering over where he stands on important questions. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s insecurity is also evident in his frequent boasting. Such a man is unlikely to be an effective executive.</p>
<p>I challenge anyone to find a passage in either DMF or AOH that gives evidence of a mind which is either first rate or capable of independent thought. The books are filled with three things: Mr. Obama&rsquo;s novelistic re-constructions or imaginings (take your choice), his racial paranoia, and a thoroughly pedestrian retailing of conventional opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s grasp of economics seems to go no further than the belief that solutions to every social problem are found by spending more taxpayer money. He seems to have no serious thoughts as to how the money is to be found or knowledge about the record of such public spending efforts in the past. The books leave me with real doubts about his intellectual capacity, especially when it comes to economics and finance.</p>
<p>An emotionally insecure president who doesn&rsquo;t really understand political realities, especially economic ones, represents a great danger to both America and the world  &mdash;  and we are saddled with him for another 46 months.</p>

		<p>I object to the characterization of Alan Keyes as some kind of &#8220;conservative.&#8221;  He came out for reparations during his pitiful campaign versus Obama for that Senate seat.  I get the feeling that some Illinoisians voted Obama simply because he was less liberal.</p>

		<p>This good article has a flaw. It starts from the subtitle: <br>
&#8220;What is the character(?) of the man Americans have elected President?&#8221;<br>
How can one talk about a thing that does not exist!? <br>
Like:<br>
obama - knowledge<br>
obama - experience<br>
obama - honesty<br>
obama - patriotism<br>
etc., etc.<br>

<p>&#8220;The victories that the sixties generation brought about &mdash; the admission of minorities and women into full citizenship, the strengthening of individual liberties&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Regardless of how one may feel about the &rsquo;60s   &mdash;   and like most of us here on AR, I have deep misgivings about the period Kent Brockman called that &#8220;shrill, pointless decade&#8221;   &mdash;   one thing is absolutely certain: the various lib/left trends that got underway during that time most certainly have NOT resulted in a &#8220;strengthening of individual liberties.&#8221; Every &rsquo;60s trend or fad   &mdash;   from feminism to Civil Rights to Great Society welfare-statism   &mdash;   has required an ENLARGING of government, which in turn necessarily requires a LESSENING of individual liberties. </p>
<p>Which means that this particular passage of Obama&rsquo;s is patently FALSE. </p>

		<p>This Barack Obama is a spoiled Middle Class WHITE kid raised by ultraliberal grandparents and their kooky daugther. The author is totally correct that Mr. Obama has had an easy life and thus can&rsquo;t take a hard punch. This phony &#8220;black&#8221; man can be knocked out(metaphorically).

		<p>Titular head of a cult of personality for the emotionally unstable and mentally weak.  Take one good look at his white supporters, emotional cripples born too late to have joined the Jim Jones cult, but Obama will suffice.  It is not inconceivable that blacks will turn on him before the white true believers.</p>

		<p>The Somali pirate standoff is perhaps revealing.  There are SEALs present who could rescue the the hapless captain and kill all the Somali pirates in the process if given the green light.  They&rsquo;re not being given the chance because of their commander-in-chief.  </p>
<p>This has the potential to become Obama&rsquo;s defining moment, as the Iranian hostage crisis became the defining issue of the Carter presidency.  Hopefully it will result in the Buffoon-in-chief being swept out of office in four years, or better yet, impeached before then.  </p>
<p>But I suppose the latter would be impossible with Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi next in line.  I can just see Obama and Michelle cackling and high-fiving one another over his choice a of running mate.  &#8220;We be untouchable! An&rsquo; that dummy Biden don&rsquo; get it!&#8221; </p>

<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t believe that Europe was wowed by Obama, at in my country( Romania), we are what you would call racist, I thing that less than 1% would vote for someone who is not white.</p>
<p>Maybe we are not educated at the level you are in USA, but in my country we would not even vote for somebody who is white but not Romanian.</p>

		<p>Vlad, you are assuredly *not* an extremist, for your remarks are some of the sanest I&rsquo;ve ever heard from a European on this fraudulent disgrace of an election. There are indeed powerful forces behind this individual&rsquo;s SELECTION as (P)resident, and it was only the college kids, minorities, gullible dunces, and ACORN cheats who fell for this insanity whilst the other half of the nation made a concerted effort to keep this Kenyan-born, Indonesian-adopted imposter out of our Oval Office. We wonder how a nation that was conceived, created, nurtured, and sustained by pioneers from the British Isles and Central and Northern Europe could possibly ever consider a non-White as its commander-in-chief, but I must admit that either the mainstream media are over-reporting (far be it from them)on his popularity there or Europe is truly intrigued by this Marxist &#8220;novelty.&#8221; </p>
<p>I am heartened by your statement that they were not genuinely &#8220;wowed&#8221; by him.</p>

<p>1.  The extreme unpopularity of George W. Bush ensured that whichever Democrat got the nomination would have a huge advantage in the general election</p>
<p>2.  Minorities and white-guilt-obsessed liberals (who constitute a huge portion of the Democrat party) ushered in Obama, indifferent to his lack of substance or experience</p>
<p>3.  Obama, via suspect means, raised nearly a billion dollars for his campaign - three times as much as McCain, who was hamstrung by his own campaign finance reform legislation</p>

<i>&#8220;Please, somebody explain in a few sentences how this happened.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>My summation would be two words: guilt and lies.</p>
<p>Americans have been made to feel guilty for the natural failings of blacks. It has been beat into the minds of the American people that the problems blacks have are the result of white people being racist and denying them basic freedoms.</p>
<p>The other aspect is lies. Americans have been told a steady stream of lies that blacks are just like whites. If there are any differences in achievement and outcome, it&rsquo;s because white people have not treated blacks as equals.</p>
<p>Many white people want to believe that blacks and whites can live together in peace and harmony. They voted for Obama because they saw it as a way of showing blacks that they aren&rsquo;t racists and that they believe blacks are equal to whites.</p>
<p>Whites have been made to feel guilty about their past treatment of blacks and they have come to believe the lie that blacks can achieve anything a white man can if he&rsquo;s treated fairly.</p>
<p>Obama was seen as a means to bridge the racial divide in America. That&rsquo;s why I believe most whites voted for him.</p>
<p>Also, Bush was a mediocre Republican President who was had no accomplishments other than his vague &#8216;war on terrorism&rsquo;. McCain ran a poor campaign. In an image savvy pop culture, Obama was more charismatic than McCain.</p>
<p>In the end, many Americans just wanted anyone other than another Republican President like Bush.  </p>

		<p>Vlad, just a few quick points off the top of my head of why Obama was elected:</p>
<p>- A general public weariness of George Bush and his policies.</p>
<p>- The GOPs nominee, McCain, turned off the base by his liberal stance on so many issues, especially Amnesty. </p>
<p>- High gasoline prices throughout the year had people hurting economically.</p>
<p>- The stock market implosion in the months before the election saw peoples retirement savings being wiped out.</p>
<p>- More people on welfare or dependant on the government means more votes for the democrats.</p>
<p>- Whites are now only about 60% of the US population. As Whites become minorities, it will result in fewer and fewer Whites being elected to any sort of political office.</p>

Maybe Barry should invite Larry Sinclair over for a little rose garden tete-a-tete with whole the family so everyone can engage in wholesome family conversation about hitting the crack pipe and getting fellated by a man in the back of a limousine.  </p>

		<p>The greatest weapon to be deployed against Obama is humor. Satirical jokes, polite sarcasm and occasional ridicule may be used to effectively neutralize him. One person pointed out to me that Obama may be a one term president or the second president to resign from office. He is a figurehead not a leader. </p>

From now on, every ticket will HAVE to include at least one female and/or nonwhite.  Or, as I&rsquo;ve heard it expressed, every ticket from now on will look like a news anchor team on TV.  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I suspect we&rsquo;ve passed a historical dividing line, a major milestone, beyond which there&rsquo;s no returning.  Often, such crucial events are not recognized at the time, but their significance is only grasped by historians in hindsight.</p>
<p>I forget which emperor it was, but I remember that the last Roman emperor <i>who was Italian </i> came quite early    &mdash;     after Rome&rsquo;s peak, but not towards the end of Rome, as one might expect.  The significant thing is that after the first non-Italian emperor came to power, there were no more Italian emperors of Rome.  After that, they were all of foreign birth.</p>
<p>Could history be repeating itself with Obama?  Yes, I think we&rsquo;ve passed a historical marker that the American public may not fully recognize.</p>

		<p>You can thank the Republican Party for the fact that Obama is now President.  Back when he ran for the Senate the Stupid Party felt they just <i>had</i> to put up a black candidate, so they drafted Keyes, thus handing the election to Obama.  In the 2008 presidential race the Republicans rejected a pro-peace, anti-illegal alien amnesty, anti-tax, limited government candidate and selected a man who teamed up with Ted Kennedy for an illegal alien amnesty, who thinks that the only problem with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that we haven&rsquo;t started a third war with Iran, and who is frankly well on his way to senility.</p>
<p>So we were screwed.  We now have a socialist advocate of bigger government, amnesty for illegals, gun restrictions, deficits, taxes, and unending discrimination against whites.  And he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in any great hurry to get out of the mires in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Thanks a lot, Republican establishment.</p>

<p>Great comments, WR.  Having become convinced of the fashionable need (so they&rsquo;re told) to woo the Black &amp; Hispanic vote, the foolish Republican Party has abandoned and betrayed its traditional white voter base. </p>
<p>They have forgotten the value of a bird in the hand, and so they have gone chasing after the birds in the bush (Blacks &amp; Hispanics)&hellip; which they ave NEVER going to catch anyway!   But they still don&rsquo;t learn. No wonder they&rsquo;re the Stupid Party.</p>
