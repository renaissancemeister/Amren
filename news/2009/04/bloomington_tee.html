<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 19-year-old Bloomington man was charged Monday after police said up to a dozen teenagers blocked the street near Oak and Mulberry early Saturday afternoon and harassed a woman in her car.</p>
<p>Brett Lane, 19, of the 900 block of West Olive Street, was charged with aggravated battery, court documents said.</p>
<p>The woman, 24, was driving near Mulberry and Oak streets a few minutes after noon while on her way to visit her brother, 34, who lives in the 500 block of North Mason Street, police said. When the brother came up and asked the group to let his sister&rsquo;s car through, he was jumped by four or five teens, police said.</p>
<p>While the man was beaten, others in the mob threw rocks, bricks and debris at the sister and two of the brother&rsquo;s roommates, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some screamed racially derogatory names, Moss said. One person yelled, &#8220;This is our neighborhood, white boy,&#8221; Moss said.</p>
<p>The teenagers were black, Moss said.</p>
<p>Police do not know why the group surrounded the car or fought with the three roommates, Moss said.</p>
<p>There is no indication the victims knew the attackers, but the incident is being treated as a hate crime, Moss said. Police continue to investigate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lane was the only person arrested as of Monday.</p>
<p>While Lane initially was booked on additional, preliminary charges, the aggravated battery charge was the only one filed by prosecutors on Monday.</p>

			<p>Police do not know, eh?  Let&rsquo;s see the attackers yelled out what they were doing.  This is just classic bantustan behaviour, not at all different than what went on in Soweto or other South African slums years back.  Deprive whites access to your neighborhoods while insisting that they welcome you in theirs.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple even the police should be able to figure this out. </p>

			<p>Throughout history, war has killed millions and millions of people.  The greatest causes of conflict are differences between two groups (diversity).  Any time two fundamentally different people are forced to live together, there is conflict.  For calm, safe, and productive societies, it is best to live among a homeogeneous group that shares ethnicity, language, culture, religion, etc.  </p>

			<p>Bloomington-Normal, IL used to be a quiet Midwestern town of about 100,000 population.  It was a safe place where kids could ride their bikes anywhere and play outside until well after dark.  It has a wonderful &#8220;trail&#8221; (converted from a rail line) that runs through the town, and people from grandparents to children walk or bike the trail all day long.  </p>
<p>About 15 years ago someone started moving large numbers of African-Americans from Chicago to our quiet town.  Immediately afterwords, the closest grocery store (Eagles) begin to have a huge shop-lifting problem.  It culminated with an older white gentleman  being murdered for $40 outside the store by a recent Chicago immigrant.  After that, Eagles closed.  Likewise one of our local malls was torn down and replaced with individual, stand-alone shops that do not attract crowds of Minority teenagers.  In just the past 2 years, we have seen a large increase in rapes, gang fights, drive-by shootings, robberies, muggings, and brutal attacks of strollers on our beloved trail.  People are becoming afraid to take a walk on the trail or to be outside at night.  This is the first step in destroying the high quality of life and sense of community in our formerly nice town. White people are already starting to move out of the increasing Black areas.  It is the beginning of the cancer that will eventually destroy our nice town. Wherever Africans go, the result is the same, be it Zimbabwe, Haiti, Detroit, or Bloomington-Normal, IL.</p>

			<p>This is my hometown and neighborhood. It is interesting to note most blacks in this town are mixed race. On a few occasions walking home from downtown I have been accosted by young black men selling crack or prostitutes. Racism Not in our town yearly rallies have been held here. I do not feel welcome here. </p>

			<p><em>&#8220;&hellip;and harassed a woman in her car.&#8221;<em></em></em></p>
<p>Getting pelted with rocks and debris is hardly &#8216;harassment. </p>
<p><em>&#8220;Police do not know why the group surrounded the car or fought with the three roommates, Moss said.</em></p>
<p>Huh? This group of Blacks clearly targeted these people solely because they were White.</p>
<p>Would there be ANY question were the races reversed? </p>
<p>Interesting to note that the article stated the incident was being treated as a hate crime, but thus far, only one Black was charged, and even then, only with aggravated battery and NOT a hate crime. </p>

			<p>Blacks walk in the street instead of the sidewalk and block traffic and dare cars to hit them.This is more than likely how it started.I think the reason they walk in the street is to declare that this is our neighbor now whitey.Euclid is changing community and the way the police handle this is to ticket the parents for their kids walking in the street.It seems to have worked I see less black kids in the street.Make the parents take responsibility for their kids actions.</p>

			<p>Well, here is an example of someone being charged with a hate crime for violence against a white person.  At least we can&rsquo;t say it NEVER happens.  Let&rsquo;s hope that other jurisdictions see the light.</p>

			<p>I thought this type of racial violence was a thing of the past, now that we have a black president who was going to bring everyone together and put all this racial hatred behind us.</p>

			<p>So the prosecutors refused to file hate crime charges. This couldn&rsquo;t be becouse the victims were white could it? The odds of filing hate crime charges against blacks are further reduced in a blue liberal state like Illinois. You see, the white liberal mind can only concieve racism as a one- way street while blacks overtly use it only to their advantage. When the victim is white and perpetraitor(s) aren&rsquo;t, authorities and the courts don&rsquo;t fear reprisals as they would from blacks and the media. It&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting that whites view other whites as tame. </p>
<p>About a dozen tribal hoodlums jump three white men and three women. There is a hidden lesson here: Black males tend to start acting like a pack of wild dogs when their numbers exceed about three. Once this threshold is passed a wilding mentality begins to emerge. Even blacks you might be civil with or friendly towards can start acting menacing in the presence of their homies. So be on guard, watch your back and fight hard if it comes to that. </p>

			<p>I live in B-N too. Less than a month ago this same defendant had felony charges of aggravated battery and mob action nol-prossed, that is, dropped by motion of the State&rsquo;s Attorney. http://tinyurl.com/csnkgz</p>
<p>The police and courts have become overwhelmed at a time when our municipal, county and state governments have been bankrupted by both corruption and capital spending on behalf of labor unions and real estate developers. (We have a new $50 million Coliseum that 68% of the public voted against and which loses nearly $3 million per year.) Crime, in the scheme of government here, plays merely second fiddle. </p>

			<p>The Man,</p>
<p>The best way to handle the kids in the street is like what I observed some years ago when I was living in Jackson Hts., Qns., NYC. Three boys were pulling the shuffle in the street when a livery cab came down the street going at least in the high fifties mph. He never even tried to stop. no horn, no brakes, no swerving to avoid them, no stopping, nothing, just total straight ahead. If those boys didn&rsquo;t get the lead out real fast, they were road kill. Of course, when they were able to get out of the way, they were all three yelling curses. But I think those were three young guys who never pulled the teenage shuffle in front of a car again.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think THIS jurisdiction has seen the light, walrus.  The only charge filed so far, according to the article, is aggravated battery.  And only one suspect out of a rock throwing &#8220;mob&#8221; was arrested at all.  </p>
<p>Additionally,  the police saying that they don&rsquo;t know why this happened should give you another clue.   </p>
<p>If you are going to wait for the authorities to &#8220;see the light&#8221;, you are operating under some grave misconceptions.  They repeatedly demonstrate either a determined refusal to see the light, or an outright commitment to bringing darkness upon us. </p>
<p>If we refuse to see the light for ourselves, we will soon have nothing to see but darkness.</p>

			<p> I live in the Chicago area and almost all black neighborhoods were once settled and built by Whites before them. Blacks forced the Whites out by their criminal tendencies.</p>

			<p>   Police know damn good and well why they attacked the white people. But, if they intend to keep their jobs, they will pretend they don&rsquo;t. Anyway, I am on my way to the Tax Protest Rally in Dayton, Ohio today. I hope that many of you will attend one also. There are many of them across the nation today. Make your voices heard. Be on the look out for government sponsored trouble-makers. They are promising to start trouble for us. </p>

			<p>Why is this even newsworthy? It&rsquo;s utterly self-evident that black Africans, once they reach a certain critical mass, destroy every neighborhood, every municipality, every city, every state, every country, and every continent they inhabit.  There are no exceptions to this immutable reality. Not one.</p>
<p>When whites are finally displaced by the next dominant race, most likely unsentimental East Asians, the black African races will be dealt with with great finality. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this for a second.</p>
<p>The police, the ones on the front lines, well know the problem is black anti-White hatred.  Obviously, this fact cannot be stated out loud as a policeman would risk his career to do so.</p>
<p>It is the media and the anti-White educational system that enforce the PC reign of terror we must all bow down to.</p>
<p>If the races were reversed, this would have been national news and the alphabet networks would be falling all over themselves giving unlimited air time to $harpton and Jack$on and the ACUL, ADL, SPLC and the Justice Department would be demanding harsh penalties, including enhanced punishment due to hate crimes.  Mau-Mauing to PC overseers and monstrous amounts of money would be demanded from Whites as restitution.</p>
<p>This, and other recent hushed-up black-on-White violent attacks, is a prime example as to why Whites need to band together, form pro-White Civil Rights organizations that work in their interests and put a quick end to black-on-White violence.  </p>
<p>To hell with individualism except to arm one&rsquo;s self for protection.</p>

			<p>  It pains me to read this because many years ago I lived in Bloomington, Illinois. I was there for about four years. It was a nice quiet Midwestern community with two universities, Illinois State and Illinois Wesleyan, as well as State Farm Insurance and other local industries. Blacks were present but not a significant part of the community at that time. Crime was not a problem and it was safe to walk anywhere at any time of the day. It sounds like increasing &#8220;diversity&#8221; has had the same predictable, depressing results it always does.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;While Lane initially was booked on additional, preliminary charges, the aggravated battery charge was the only one filed by prosecutors on Monday.&#8221;&hellip;.sounds like the D.A. is NOT charging this as a hate crime. I&rsquo;m sure it will be pled down to a petty misdomeaner and a parade will be held to celebrate the release of this racist thug.</p>

			<p>It looks like the Chicago corruption sludge is spreading all over the state of Illinois.  Illinois voters who live outside of Chicago need to vote opposite of how they vote in Chicago.  Of course Chicago is overwhelmingly democratic so the people of the rest of the state need to vote republican to balance out Chicago&rsquo;s large numbers.  </p>
<p>Who started moving large numbers of blacks into Bloomington? No doubt the Chicago democrat machine needed more democrat votes in that part of the state.  The democrats alway think in this conniving way.  By moving blacks to Bloomington they probably got another democrat seat in the House of Representatives.</p>
