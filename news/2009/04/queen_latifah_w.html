<h1>Queen Latifah Wants Stronger Parts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Queen Latifah has said there are not enough roles for strong, interesting black women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&rsquo;t enough roles and this invisibility is really starting to annoy me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She continued: &#8220;You would think that there are no black actresses in Hollywood when you look at some of the women&rsquo;s magazines. Not that I want the paparazzi following me everywhere, but sometimes in the magazines, it seems that we don&rsquo;t even exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that there is a great disparity in how different actors are treated: &#8220;I see actors who have barely made a movie getting so much attention and publicity, whereas black actresses are completely ignored, which in a way makes the world think that they can ignore us too. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>The actress also said that she is working hard to change the situation. &#8220;When I am a producer on a film or the star of a movie, I make sure that the set is multi cultural, I make sure they hire a multi cultural, qualified crew, I don&rsquo;t want to look up and see all white men in front of me all day. I don&rsquo;t have anything against white men, but why would I be in this position and not make sure that everyone has opportunities?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Papparazzi is entirely image driven. Their whole parasitic existence depends on producing images that will catch people&rsquo;s eye. While we indulge the &#8216;black is beautiful&rsquo; myth, the reality is they do not catch people&rsquo;s eye.</p>

There are a limited number of movies produced every year and consequently a limited number of roles for actors of any race.</p>
<p>The SOLUTION, again, is for blacks to create their own production companies so they can make the films they want. But that&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>

			<p>With whom exactly, one wonders, is she &#8220;annoyed?&#8221; Surely this woman isn&rsquo;t suggesting that Hollywood or the entertainment industry on the whole is somehow &#8220;racist&#8221; or in the practice of excluding Blacks from&hellip;well, anything, is she? There is not a more unapologetically, nay, proudly Politically Correct force on planet earth than the greater entertainment industry/Hollywood, etc. Thus, I cannot imagine who she thinks is holding out on Blacks!</p>
<p>Next, she obviously needs to be taught the difference between culture and race. She says &#8220;multicultural&#8221; multiple times when she clearly means multiracial. Do these brazen idiots even hear what they themselves ever say?  </p>

			<p>If there aren&rsquo;t enough movie roles for &#8220;strong, interesting&#8221; black women, perhaps this is because typical moviegoers are not interested in forking over seven or eight dollars to watch some imbecillic harridan on screen for 90 minutes.  The movie industry is, after all, market-driven to some extent.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Queen Latifah has said there are not enough roles for strong, interesting black women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two quick points.</p>
<p>First, Queen Latifah is the &#8220;queen&#8221; of what, idiotic statements? She is absolutely one of the worst black &#8220;actresses,&#8221; I have ever had the misfortune of having to watch preform. She carries herself as if her bowel movements don&rsquo;t stink, as bad as her so-called acting does. </p>
<p>Second, there are far too many &#8220;interesting black women&#8221; of the Queen Latifah stripe in Hollywood already. They all somehow confuse &#8220;strength&#8221; with arrogance, &#8220;assertiveness&#8221; with aggression, and &#8220;education&#8221; with the ability to squeak and chirp mindlessly. </p>
<p>That sure is what we need more of in this country.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what &#8216;the queen&rsquo; is really saying;<br>
<i>You would think that there are no black actresses in Hollywood when you look at some of the women&rsquo;s magazines.</i><br>
Translation; &#8220;I&rsquo;m most happy in a black centric world and judge not on who is on the cover, but what is on the cover.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;When I am a producer on a film or the star of a movie, I make sure that the set is multi cultural,</i><br>
Translation; &#8220;I see nothing wrong refusing whites employment based on nothing more than their color&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to look up and see all white men in front of me all day.</i><br>
this doesn&rsquo;t need any &#8216;spin&rsquo; as she plainly states she&rsquo;s blatantly racist and sexist, then actually contradicts herself with;  <i>I don&rsquo;t have anything against white men,</i></p>
<p><i>why would I be in this position and not make sure that everyone has opportunities?&rdquo;</i><br>
Translation; Qualified white males will be refused work.</p>
<p>Thank god the queens not a real queen or a despot like her would simple kill off those whites that un-evened the census.</p>
<p><br>
Far more revealing is the fact she feels comfortable enough to even say such things out loud. She correctly realizes that 99% of the foolish public can&rsquo;t see the blatant hatred for the very same majority that made her what she is. </p>
<p>I may not want to &#8220;look up and see black woman in front of me all day&#8221;, but would never refuse one employment simple because she was a she and black.</p>

Ms.Owens (Queen Latifah),you cant&rsquo;t holler racism and then turn around and do the very same thing that you accuse other(white) people of. It&rsquo;s called a double standard!</p>

			<p>Translation: &#8220;Hollywood discrimnates against me and that is bad, (and in the same breath) but I happily &#8216;reverse&rsquo; discriminate because I am good&#8221;. </p>
<p>I discriminate against her because visually she looks like a bus (or has at least had a run in with one) and the types of roles she is cast in are either aimed at the the &#8216;I need some new rims crowd&rsquo;(won a BET comedy award for Barbershop 2) or the &#8216;we will teach the world how to live hollywood liberals&rsquo;(see Synopsis for<br>
&#8216;The Secret Life of Bees&rsquo; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/dljald" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/dljald</a> &hellip;.gag).</p>
<p>Two films I&rsquo;ve seen in the last couple of weeks that I would highly reconmend, &#8220;There will be blood&#8221; and &#8220;3.10 to Yuma&#8221; (remake?). Amreners would approve of both I am sure.</p>

			<p>Hmmm, wasn&rsquo;t it her talk show that Jared Taylor was on talking about racial profiling? She doesn&rsquo;t believe in profiling when it comes to law enforcement, but obviously, when it comes to the movies, she practices her own form of &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, now, I think I can explain the matter so that you might better understand the situation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an affirmative action figure, queeny old girl.  Putting you and other black women in high profile slots is done by the greedy elites to protect their power and money.  They want to keep the riotous faction of the population quiet, so they dream up slots in which to insert less than mediocre talents.  If blacks think they&rsquo;ve got true representation in the talk shows, then it will keep them occupied with something other than rioting and burning up their own neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worked pretty well, too, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>As far as the news people are concerned, they just don&rsquo;t want to waste their time on anybody who who will draw interest from only a few people from her own minority tribe.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand the situation.  If you were white, you&rsquo;d be cleaning houses someplace, so just be glad you belong to a privileged minority.</p>

<p>You are so right. I work in a civil service environment where black females are the plurality. I should be in 7Th Heaven walking in each day with all these bitter Latifahs but I must be lacking as most of these broads are highly unattractive. Although I will say they do have big mouths, I will give them credit for that.</p>

			<p>Once again the selfish black person shows up to scream &#8220;racism&#8221; because they themselves haven&rsquo;t received something. What &#8220;Queen&#8221; Latifah is really yelping about is that she herself hasn&rsquo;t gotten some acting job.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Perhaps there would be if there were more &#8220;interesting&#8221; black women. The ones I see on tv while channel surfing are about as interesting as mowing the lawn. Non stop chatter about nothing, which is what I see the oprah&rsquo;s of that vast wasteland do, isnt strong and it isnt interesting&hellip;.Next case. </p>

			<p>The only time I saw a movie with Queen Latifah was when I was forced to on a plane.  It was the one where she is the intelligent black woman taxi driver and Jimmy Fallon is the clumsy, goofy White cop. It was the only time I had to use a barf bag on a plane.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t even go to movies that have blacks or a multi-cultural cast if I can help it. It&rsquo;s not the type of world I want for myself and my family. I want white isolation. I find absolutely no enrichment by being around non-whites.  Not a single bit.</p>
<p>I saw TWILIGHT recently. What a farce. The setting was a small town with just a couple of thousand people yet it looked like the Star Wars bar or the United Nations. Even the vampires were multi-culti. Really stupid casting.</p>

			<p>Instead of pairing a black woman with a black man they pair blond women. And it&rsquo;s not just in movies but its in kid&rsquo;s cartoons, books, everywhere. The powers that be have largely squeezed black women out. Maybe Ms Latifah should think about that.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the &#8220;Queen&#8221; could get a gig doing commercials on TV.  Ever since the &#8220;Annointed One&#8221; was hand selected to destroy our once great country, about 1 in every 2 commercials features a black person/family.  I always thought that they made up about 12% of the population.  I would guess that white people don&rsquo;t watch television anymore, or the commercial&rsquo;s producer&rsquo;s want us to believe that the blacks are the majority.  </p>

			<p>First,  there are all sorts of use of black females on TV and in ads, the judge, or other authority figure is black female. With some goofy white guy. (I recall watching a bit of the Jeffersons where this happened.<br>
Second, I recall Lena Horne being bitter in not being given starring roles. As what? a mullato mistress? If they put her in a lead with a black male lead, would he have been dark or light, or what? too many issues here. I recall Dorothy Dandridge with Harry Belafonte in &#8220;Carmen Jones&#8221; which made some sense. But.. it was a black movie. Horne/Latifah want&hellip; what? Leads with white guys? </p>

			<p>Every couple of years, some black actress or actor will pop up and there will be this big thing about the blackout of Hollywood and then the academy awards will devote an entire awards ceremony to blacks.  Like when Denzel Washington won and Halle Berry.</p>
<p>This is so obnoxious, I am so well over done on this whole blacks are being slighted thing.  </p>

<p>I agree that it would benefit blacks to start their own production companies, although I would wager that they wouldn&rsquo;t stay in business very long.  However, you are correct, it&rsquo;s never going to happen.  Because as my Dad told us many many years ago, blacks don&rsquo;t want a house like ours, they want our house, they don&rsquo;t want a car like ours, they want our car and they don&rsquo;t want to work for any of those things, because they thing it&rsquo;s owed to them.  And I heard an intelligent black radio host last night say, that this kind of stuff is never going to change until black parents stop shoving this sorrow thing down their kids throats.<br>

			<p>I beg to differ somewhat in your assessment of the movie &#8220;Twilight.&#8221;  Washington State is a pretty liberal state and has quite a mix of races.  Of course, Forks is pretty small to be so multicultural.  However, I was glad that the main characters were at least of the same race.</p>
<p>Of course, you did notice that it was the black vampire that warned the Cullens about the evil James and Victoria.  </p>

			<p>I remember when Halle Berry was sqawking about how racist Hollywood was and they appeased her by making her the most beautiful actress in tinseltown even though she would be considered average if she were White.  Is Queen Latifah trying for a similar angle?  Queen Latifa needs to face the fact that she is limited in what kind of roles she can play.  She can&rsquo;t  play a sexpot vixen, an intellectual or a CEO.  She could be a bus driver, hairdresser or welfare mom.  If I were a producer, I&rsquo;d have her cast in a hairnet as an elementary school lunchlady. </p>
