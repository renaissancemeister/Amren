	<p>A Greenfield father accused of selling his daughter for money, beer and other items accepted a plea bargain that could shorten his time in jail to a month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The deal will have Martinez, who has been in prison since his arrest in January, serving an additional one to four months.</p>
<p>Martinez had originally refused a plea offer from prosecutors, and a trial was set to start Monday.</p>
<p>The father is accused of asking for $20,000, 100 cases of Corona beer, 50 cases of Modelo beer, several cases of meat, two cases of wine, 50 cases of Gatorade and 50 cases of soft drinks on a cardboard box in an attempt to arrange a marriage between his 14-year-old daughter to his 18-year-old neighbor.</p>

								<h2>Plea Deal for Dad in Arranged Marriage</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Virginia Hennessey, Monterey Herald, April 7, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A Greenfield father accused of arranging a marriage for his 14-year-old daughter pleaded no contest to child endangerment Monday on the cusp of his trial. </p>
<p>Attorneys for Marcelino Martinez said he still denies that he agreed to let his daughter marry an 18-year-old neighbor, but accepted the plea bargain rather than risk a 10-year prison sentence that would have ended with his deportation. </p>
<p>Under the plea deal, Martinez will be sentenced May 7 to probation and up to a year in jail. Incarcerated since his Jan. 12 arrest, he will be released in the next one to four months, his attorneys said. </p>
<p>He is expected to be deported at that time. </p>
<p>Martinez, 36, was charged with procuring a child for sex, aiding and abetting statutory rape, and child endangerment for allegedly agreeing to let his daughter marry 18-year-old Margarito Galindo after the young couple ran away together. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Among the evidence prosecutor Cristina Johnson planned to present to a jury was a cardboard sheet dated Dec. 22 that she maintained was a marriage contract negotiated by Galindo&rsquo;s parents after the young lovers ran away. The sheet detailed a dowry, including $16,000 in cash and hundreds of cases of beverages and meat, that the Galindos were to pay Martinez for a wedding reception. </p>
<p>But defense attorneys Miguel and J. Hernandez said they planned to drop a bombshell at the trial with evidence that the list actually detailed food, beer and wine that the Galindos ordered for a large baptism party they held Dec. 27. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayes took great pains before accepting the plea to make sure that Martinez  &mdash;  who speaks only Triqui, the indigenous language of Oaxaca, where jury trials and &#8220;no contest&#8221; pleas are a foreign concept  &mdash;  understood the rights he was giving up. </p>
<p>As two interpreters translated from English to Spanish to Triqui, the judge informed him that, if he were in the country illegally and he entered a plea of guilty or no contest, he would be deported and could never legally return to the United States. </p>
<p>Martinez said he understood. &#8220;I am guilty,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The negotiations took place under the watchful eye of Mexican Consulate representative Blanca Zarazua of Salinas and consulate attorney Francisco Hernandez. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Zarazua said it is possible criminal charges would not have been filed if Martinez were able to communicate with investigators in the beginning. </p>
<p>Greenfield Police Chief Joe Grebmeier initially characterized the case in a press release as a father &#8220;selling&#8221; his daughter in a case of &#8220;human trafficking.&#8221; The next day, he retracted the statement, saying Martinez had agreed to an arranged marriage, which is common in the Triqui culture. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Galindo pleaded guilty to misdemeanor statutory rape and was released into federal custody on an immigration warrant over the weekend. He was to be released with a global-positioning bracelet pending his testimony at Martinez&rsquo;s trial. Zarazua said she expects he will be deported in the coming weeks. <br>

			<p>What are they going to deport him for?</p>
<p>I mean, they usually wait until an illegal gets drunk and kills someone with his uninsured car before they send him packing.</p>
<p>But even in a lot of cases they wait until he builds up a rap sheet a half-mile long and then murders someone before they decide to act.</p>
<p>This sounds rather unusual.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they finally decide on probation and bide their time until he decides to murder someone, then they can proceed with only a few calling them racists, you know, the word the spinless politicians fear more than being an incestuous parent or something equally despicable?</p>

			<p>This is a classic PC catch-22 at its finest. If you&rsquo;re a liberal, do you stand up for the minority rights or women&rsquo;s rights in this case? </p>

			<p>He won&rsquo;t be deported. He can&rsquo;t be deported until an immigration Judge issues a deportation order.</p>
<p> He will be released from prison and housed in a city or county jail.  Then he will go before an ICE immigration Judge to determine whether he should be deported.  He will be provided free legal counsel by some Ford Foundation or Church group.</p>
<p>The immigration lawyer may very well be a woman.  Ths social workers provided by the immigration group will definitely be women. The social workers will promise to provide him with housing, a job and counseling.</p>
<p>The hearings will be continued.  If he is not actually out of the country within six months he will be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>NOTE CAREFULLY  Out of the country, not just under deportation order.</p>
<p>His home country must agree to accept him within the six month time limit.  Mexico has a history of not accepting their &#8220;Wretched Refuse&#8221; as Emma Lazurus&rsquo; poem says. The airline must agree to accept him on their plane without handcuffs.  If he makes a fuss in the airport the airline will not allow him to board.</p>
<p>The ACLU traitors recently got a federal judicial ruling that ICE deportation agents may not sedate deportees, but must allow them their full facilities to rant, rave, throw things etc in the effort to be denied permission to travel on the airplane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doubt he will ever be deported due to the failure of immigration judges to defy the Ford Foundation front groups.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Probation Officer.  In these cases the liberals, including the women always, always stand up for the criminal except in the exceedingly rare cases where the criminal is white.  This was true in 1939, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99, and 2009.<br>
Unfortunately it will always be true.</p>
<p>But believe me, there are very few white male rapists and child molesters, an infinitesmal percentage compared to the black, hispanic and even that so called model minority asian males.</p>

			<p>Well, it sounds like somebody in California finally grew a pair, and decided to stand up for OUR laws, and OUR cultural sensibilities.  I&rsquo;m sure this is just a fluke, and not the start of a trend.  But maybe&hellip;.</p>
<p>Calling this &#8216;Child Trafficking&rsquo; is a stretch, though.  Still, &#8216;Barter for Brides&rsquo; is not we do things in America, and I&rsquo;m glad this is one little bit of diversity&rsquo;s richness that California is not (yet) embracing.</p>

			<p>Look at that picture.  Those guys all look alike:  the same cheap Walmart psuedo rancher&rsquo;s shirt, the same sleepy looking eyes, the same vacant expression that says &#8220;I have no responsibility for any of this.&#8221;   I see them in court every day.</p>

			<p>I hope that when English was being expensively translated into Spanish, and then into &#8216;Triqui&rsquo;, that someone relayed to Marcelino Martinez the concept of &#8216;simple carbohydrates&rsquo;, and that maybe if he&rsquo;d consume less booze, soda-pop, and &#8216;sports drinks&rsquo;, he might not need strategically-placed pockets on the chest portion of his shirt.</p>

			<p>He won&rsquo;t be deported. He can&rsquo;t be deported until an immigration Judge issues a deportation order.</p>
<p>Even if the judge orders him deported, what effect will that have? The Mexicans come and go as they please in our country.</p>
