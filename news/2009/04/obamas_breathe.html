<h1>Obamas Breathe New Life Into D.C.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mackenzie Carpenter, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is Washington D.C., the new New York?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word from the cultural temperature-takers  &mdash;  Vogue magazine and The Daily Beast&rsquo;s Tina Brown, for starters. And yes, the nation&rsquo;s capital does seem a different place  &mdash;  hipper, happier, more energized  &mdash;  than it did 100 days ago when Barack Obama moved into the White House.</p>
<p>At least its mayor thinks so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Fenty  &mdash;  who is black and, like Mr. Obama, also has a beautiful, accomplished lawyer wife named Michelle  &mdash;  isn&rsquo;t the only one pinching himself at the thought of the first African-American president.</p>
<p>As the media and various politicos busy themselves today hyping Mr. Obama&rsquo;s first 100 days in office, this city&rsquo;s residents and workers, most of them black and virtually all of them Democrats, seem scarcely able to contain their euphoria.</p>
<p>&#8220;20 Reasons to Love Living Here,&#8221; crowed Washingtonian Magazine&rsquo;s cover this month, featuring a shirtless Obama, rippling pectorals and all. (&#8220;Reason No. 2: &#8216;Our New Neighbor is Hot.&rsquo;&#8221;)</p>
<p>Maisha Meminger, 32, who was racing to catch a commuter train after a day at her job at the Labor Department, said that as an African-American, she looks forward to going to work these days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama has frequently invited children from the city&rsquo;s public schools to the White House. Bancroft Elementary School students, for example, have been there twice to work in the vegetable garden on the South Lawn, much to the amazement of Susan Harris, a co-founder of D.C. Urban Gardeners, who says it&rsquo;s triggered a veggie garden boom in the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama has also ventured into some of the city&rsquo;s high-crime neighborhoods, attending roundtable discussions with students at Anacostia High School, and beginning in her first week, has inspected three local nonprofits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had some fun, too. While her husband hasn&rsquo;t dined out as much as restaurateurs had hoped he would, Mrs. Obama has more than made up for it, sampling hamburgers at a Five Guys Burgers and Fries chain and soul food at B. Smith&rsquo;s in Union Station and Georgia Brown&rsquo;s on 15th and K streets.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Obamas, Washington&rsquo;s social scene, once dominated by Georgetown hostesses, has shifted its center of gravity. The city&rsquo;s African-American elites  &mdash;  from Black Entertainment Television&rsquo;s Debra Lee to longtime political fixer Vernon Jordan  &mdash;  &#8220;own this town now,&#8221; Mr. Combs [Wes Combs, a marketing executive for the homosexual community] said, noting that the administration&rsquo;s social secretary, Desiree Rogers, is black, as is the new head of the Office of Public Liaison, Valerie Jarrett.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways, we, the whites, are now the outsiders,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not in charge anymore. It&rsquo;s interesting to watch the dynamics, but if anyone is going to bridge the racial divide in this city, the Obamas are going to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the 54th annual Corcoran Ball last week, Ms. Rogers was seated at the head table, and the crowd was &#8220;hands down, more integrated than I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&#8221; said Christina Wilkie, managing editor of Washington Life magazine, which chronicles the city&rsquo;s social scene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, the city&rsquo;s thriving cultural scene has moved farther east into formerly crime-ridden neighborhoods near the 14th and U Street corridor, site of 1968&rsquo;s worst racial rioting. In the 1990s, spurred on by the city, developers began investing in urban renewal projects and today, the area is bustling with wine bars, condominiums, restaurants and antique shops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On average, these young administration people are younger and more diverse  &mdash;  racially and in sexual orientation  &mdash;  than their predecessors in the Bush administration, even as their president has surrounded himself with mostly white males as his closest political advisers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a disappointment,&#8221; one young staffer, a Latina, admitted, as she sipped a margarita.</p>
<p>Still, the highest-ranking openly gay administration official in history, John Berry, was sworn in by Mrs. Obama as Director of Personnel, Mr. Combs noted with pride.</p>

			<p>There have been white people running the show since I was born.  But how come I never have had the joy and glee, or expected special treatment, which seems to be so widespread among blacks these days?  Because white people are traitors to their own.  Take a look at the United States over the past 50 years and the facts are right there.<br>

<p>Wait until the economy goes into a full-fledged depression.  Wait until NOBAMA attempts to get legislation to pay Blacks reparations for slavery.  Wait till there&rsquo;s a full-blown war in Iran with the NOBAMA administration fully supporting the war.  Then the media will find a way to blame anything and anyone else BUT NOBAMA.</p>

			<p>Blacks have always ruled DC.  The 1800 census showed something like 800 inhabitants, around 700 blacks, 250 Whites.</p>
<p>DC is like Detroit, St. louis, Gary Indiana, Oakland Ca, parts of New York and Chicago and every other majority black city in the country; a disfunctional, crime ridden with high crime rates, bottom level schools and an affirmative action civil service that does not function, such as the infamous DC ambulance service that can take 2 hours to journey 2 miles.</p>
<p>Let the blacks enjoy it.  </p>
<p>State Department, military and other overseas government employees consider DC a worse assignment than third world countries.  The joke in the State department is that of all the &#8220;hardship posts&#8221;, DC is the very worst.</p>
<p>First world cost of housing, third world local government, corruption and crime.</p>
<p>The metro subway system is excellent as far as transit goes.  The problem with it is that it provides transport for the thugs of DC to come to the suburbs to prey on the Whites.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;20 Reasons to Love Living Here,&rdquo; crowed Washingtonian Magazine&rsquo;s cover this month, featuring a shirtless Obama, rippling pectorals and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>That picture must have been photo shopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maisha Meminger, 32, who was racing to catch a commuter train after a day at her job at the Labor Department, said that as an African-American, she looks forward to going to work these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation no work alternative to welfare affirmative action government job.  A lot of college graduates with federal jobs cannot read higher than 2nd grade level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Obama has frequently invited children from the city&rsquo;s public schools to the White House. Bancroft Elementary School students, for example, have been there twice to work in the vegetable garden on the South Lawn,&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw that picture.  The kids looked very reluctant and uncomfortable.  Is not Ms obama perpetrating stereotypes by having black children do gardening work?  Horrors, a return to slavery and share cropping when blacks did farm work instead of lounging around government offices chortling, chuckling and chatting all day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Washington&rsquo;s social scene, once dominated by Georgetown hostesses,&#8221;   The Georgetown hostesses disappeared between 1970 and 1975.</p>
<p>What does it say about a country whose government workers have such low IQs that Ronald Reagan had to junk a simple exam that required that workers in jobs requiring Bachelors, Masters and PHDs be able to pass 10th grade math and 12 grade reading aka the standard high school exit exam?</p>

			<p>The White Washington elite has to sit at table with their social inferiors because the Big Man who distributes patronage is Mulatto.  I&rsquo;d love to hear the pillow talk when Mr and Ms Big Name Journalist get back from an evening spent among high-fiving jivesters in expensive suits.  I&rsquo;ll bet there are a lot of beltway Republicans laughing at their Democrat friends who are now forced to give more than lip service to racial equality.  And I&rsquo;ll bet that the Democrats are glad that BHO doesn&rsquo;t have a couple teen aged sons asking their daughters out, an offer they could not refuse.  </p>

			<p><i>DC is like Detroit, St. louis, Gary Indiana, Oakland Ca, parts of New York and Chicago and every other majority black city in the country; a disfunctional, crime ridden with high crime rates</i></p>
<p>Well, historically it may have earned that reputation, but it&rsquo;s been rapidly gentrified in the last 20 years.  I lived there from 2005-2007 and found it a terrific place to be.  Black populations have been pushed south and east toward Anacostia or out to Prince George&rsquo;s County, and most of the Northwest portion is extremely high-priced, filled with grand turn-of-the-century townhomes on tree-lined streets.  </p>
<p>DC also has two other great things going for it from an urban living point of view that no other major American city has: 1) the height limitation, which has helped keep the downtown exceptionally dense and walkable   &mdash;   like a European city  &mdash;   and 2) no interstates gutting the downtown.  The metro is great, too.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I&rsquo;ve always found it interesting that the Congressmen who prescribed massive interstate building through the hearts of so many American cities, and clearance demolition of old neighborhoods, declined to apply these &#8220;remedies&#8221; to their own city.  An urban planning analogue to the bleeding heart liberal sending his kids to Sidwell Friends).</p>

			<p>When will we stop having PROPAGANDA THRUST AT US&hellip; and deal with realities? Washington, D.C., other than the government (public) buildings is a veritable disaster! With crime, violence and city government incompetence being the order of the day.</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t live in D.C. They prefer gated, guarded enclaves outside of Washington, in Georgetown, in Virginia. Why would they want to live in Washington D.C. with its crime, slums and squallor?</p>

<p>margaret:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving the high school exam too much credit.  It&rsquo;s more like 7th grade math and 5th grade reading.  I would argue that it&rsquo;s even lower than that.</p>
<p>The papers will tell you it&rsquo;s 10th grade math and reading but I give the test and it&rsquo;s profoundly easier than 10th-grade level.  Also, what&rsquo;s in the practice books (what the public sees) is infinitely more difficult than what is on the actual test.</p>
<p>And, I&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s getting embarrassingly easier by the year  &mdash;  all the &#8216;hard parts&rsquo; are being systematically eliminated.  This is not made public, of course, and NAMs continue to repeatedly fail it.</p>

<p>These people won&rsquo;t be satisfied until the nonwhites take over and we become just like Haiti, Bolivia, North Korea and other 3rd world paradises. </p>

Yes, and also the splendid city lay-out, very French-style, with undying  thanks to Pierre L&rsquo;Enfant.   The spacious sidewalks, the tree-lined streets, the radial Avenues, the many parks and monuments,  the harmonious architecture,  almost make you think you are somewhere in France.  I love Washington.   Aside from the faces on the street (in some parts), it is our  most attractive, best-planned,  most beautiful city.  It is a treasure too precious to lose.</p>
<p>(The second best-planned would be Madison, Wisconsin, laid out also in the Washington style.  Detroit and Buffalo too were,  originally, copied from Washington; but alas, they are now very far-gone.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in and out of DC frequently, and frankly I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about. Same falling apart slums, same miserable denizens. Admittedly I don&rsquo;t get invited to high society functions, but &#8220;euphoria&#8221; is hardly the word I would use to describe the district.</p>

<p>To each his own, bro. Glad you enjoyed your time there. But seriously, the very things you mention are the reason DC is such a nightmare in which to drive. Driving through San Antonio, which is riddled with interstates, is so much easier. The district&rsquo;s crazy road layout doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>
<p><i>Indeed, the city&rsquo;s thriving cultural scene has moved farther east into formerly crime-ridden neighborhoods near the 14th and U Street corridor, site of 1968&rsquo;s worst racial rioting. In the 1990s, spurred on by the city, developers began investing in urban renewal projects and today, the area is bustling with wine bars, condominiums, restaurants and antique shops.</i></p>
<p>The 14th St. NW corridor has never been pretty, but it&rsquo;s hardly the type of neighborhood from which DC gets its awful reputation (although if you walk as far away as 11th you&rsquo;ll notice a precipitous rise in the number of barred windows). Move all that jazz over to Anacostia and see how it works out.<br>

Posted by Bobby </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
It is a very good question!    </p>
<p>In my opinion,  #1 would be that  generous incentives are offered to racial sell-outs.   It can be very profitable (personally) to betray  one&rsquo;s own. To advance oneself by stepping on others and trodding them down is a sure way upward in the professions, media, and academia. Those who excel at it are well rewarded.</p>
<p>#2 is that whites have been stripped of any sort of common identity. It has further  been made to seem shameful and immoral even to feel any such identity. Only &#8220;racists&#8221; and other moral reprobates  would fall sway to such degenerate thoughts, while decent, upright people will resist them.  </p>
<p>Nor are any white organizations tolerated to exist - at least within the pale of  what is considered legitimate and respectable.   Those  few, strange &#8220;fringe groups&#8221;  that exist are populated by crazies and extremists, as we know. They are all probably on their way to prison, or a mental institution&hellip;. or soon will be.  (So we are told by all the media.)    </p>
<p>On the other hand, &#8220;minorities&#8221; are encouraged to form their own groups and to feel self-pride and develop a strong identity. For them, ethnic unity is admirable, not shameful.  Their identity is to be endlessly &#8220;celebrated&#8221;.  That is because &#8220;minorities&#8221; (who are always assumed to be persecuted by an arrogant majority) are allowed to enjoy special rights that others do not have.</p>
<p>And therefore, #3:  that it is disadvantageous to belong to a hated, reviled majority. No one wants to belong to a despised group, least of all one that has been identified as &#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;.  People who wish to advance themselves, seek to shed their tainted majority image and to identify with an admired  (and officially favored) minority group. Here again, those who do so are rewarded;   while those do not, are left behind.</p>

			<p>Gee, what a surprise. Who could have guessed something like that would happen, because blacks are so non-biased.</p>
<p>I just wonder what a &ldquo;black elite&rdquo; is. Is it anyone with an I.Q. over 100? </p>
<p><br>
Posted by q at 7:25 PM on April 29</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Only about 15% of Blacks in the US have IQ&rsquo;s above 100; I think that&rsquo;s a small enough segment to constitute an &#8216;elite&rsquo; of sorts. </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s completely different from what our &#8216;elite&rsquo; status is.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve worked out of D.C. for the government. I know Georgetown. I know a thing or two about the parties. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about life from both sides now. Enough to know about those same governmental employees who are now monitoring my comments here. So let me help you, and the people here, by telling you both why I don&rsquo;t think that this is the D.C. treat that T.J.envisioned.    </p>
<p>As you guys know, there are in reality, two separate D.C.&rsquo;s: (1) the government strip, including the university; and, (2) what the residents themselves call it   &mdash;   the &#8220;real&#8221; D.C.</p>
<p>The following observations, made over thirty years ago concern the real D.C.   &mdash;   things have probably changed dramatically since then; but I dare say, the changes probably haven&rsquo;t been for the better!</p>
<p>Now as grandpa would say:&#8221;during my day&#8221;:</p>
<p>(1) At least one third of the real D.C. was a pure hard core ghetto.</p>
<p>(2) At least two thirds of real D.C. had rampant crime.</p>
<p>(3) Most whites who worked in the government buildings would avoid the real  D.C. like the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>(4) You saw very few whites out past 6:00 p.m., and I mean anywhere [except in the well lit high security governmental areas]. Kind of like the &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; in another well known city today. </p>
<p>(5) Absolute, unbelievable, incompetent blacks infested, and infected, every nook, notch, crack, cranny, and crevice, in every government building, that I ever had the unfortunate need to set my foot into. I soon learned that outside of the paperwork for Congress [and that was problematical]  nothing was ever done on time! Nothing! </p>
<p>(6) It also didn&rsquo;t take me long to notice that Congressmen didn&rsquo;t seem to actually pay for anything either. I would just tag along and eat free at lunch time. There was always plenty of food and liquor at these so called &#8220;lobbyist events&#8221;. Lots, and lots of fat, bald, middle aged men with an endless supply of pretty young girls [who always seemed to vanish with the food]. I&rsquo;ve never eaten so well in my life and generally from 1:00 p.m. on I was pretty well snookered!  </p>
<p>(7) During my more sober moments, I became amazed that the government functioned as well as it did. Congressmen, who were far drunker than I, would routinely vote on bills. To me, D.C had become a kind of Hollywood on wheels, a kaleidoscope of reality which was constantly being bent and twisted by political leaders within the beltway. You can envision the dilemma of my younger variation! Young, single, in condition, twirling a Green Beret, a Rolex watch and a Tiger&rsquo;s Eye ring on my left hand and a 2.4 diamond on my right; I thought I was immortal and I had the background to prove it! </p>
<p>Then, D.C. reminded me of tinsel town on Zanex. In the morning I ate free breakfasts until I popped, followed by five [or more] martini lunches at eleven, followed by the option at 8:00 p.m. of: attending yet another one of those famous, aseptic, politically correct parties, each one of which arrived replete, with its own variation of unlimited food and drink plus swarm upon swarm of those always ubiquitous, groveling, politically correct, sycophantic eunuchs; or, perhaps I might have decided instead, on door number two: here I would go exuberantly forth in the evening determined to find some semblance of a romance [which would unfortunately, more often than not, end up like a Thomas Hardy novel in free fall]. </p>
<p>There is nothing in the world quite like an interminable lecture on Novocaine art, especially one being presented in Latin by some zoned out, dressed like a chicken, ingénue dilettante from Wellesley. Get the picture? This was my D.C. in the seventies. I&rsquo;m sure its all different now! All improved! And the economy is all going to be turning around, with all the green shoots popping up everywhere right? Yeah right!   </p>
<p>This Obama model, as currently being orchestrated and promulgated by Queen Opera, has about a year left to run. The road will be getting bumpy! The President&rsquo;s popularity will eventually start to erode along with the economy. THEN the people who did this article should do it again!</p>
<p>For me to think that any of my tax dollars are going to the support of these so called governmental employees who I once knew reminds me of what my great, great, grandfather [who died with the 3rd Alabama at Gettysburg {may God rest his soul in peace}] was known to say about secession: &#8220;when no one made you come to the dance and you did so because of your invite, and you decide that you don&rsquo;t like the dance and want to leave, no one should have the right to  tell you to stay! </p>
<p>Simply because the South lost the war does not mean that the South was wrong! </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Washington D.C. I don&rsquo;t think these politicians are any smarter than the people here. I can guarantee you one thing, at least four or five of the men [and women] that regularly hang out in this joint have far more wisdom than does this crowd in D.C. True, they may not be a rich and pretty, but this is Washington &hellip;.. not Hollywood! </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?         </p>

			<p>&#8221; it&rsquo;s been rapidly gentrified in the last 20 years. I lived there from 2005-2007 and found it a terrific place to be. Black populations have been pushed south and east toward Anacostia or out to Prince George&rsquo;s County, and most of the Northwest portion is extremely high-priced, filled with grand turn-of-the-century townhomes on tree-lined streets&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true.  There are beautiful neighborhoods being restored to their pre black ghetto beauty.  But the problem is that no matter how expensive your neighborhood, you still have to deal with the moronic Washington DC city employees.  It&rsquo;s especially bad when you come back from 12 years overseas and have to do something simple like get a DC issued driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>For a lot of us, the real nightmare was making the mistake of buying homes in Maryland 20 years ago.  Come back and find that the neighborhood has turned in to a black ghetto and the school you hoped your kids would attend when you were posted to home was dangerous for Whites due to black thugs and NAACP lawsuits running the schools.</p>

			<p>ghw, I find your reasons convincing. The sad part is that they paint a very ignoble, very depressing, picture of present white spirituality. Oh, yes, it is an issue of spirituality.</p>

			<p><i>To each his own, bro. Glad you enjoyed your time there. But seriously, the very things you mention are the reason DC is such a nightmare in which to drive. Driving through San Antonio, which is riddled with interstates, is so much easier. The district&rsquo;s crazy road layout doesn&rsquo;t help either.</i> -BW Sam</p>
<p>I guess I didn&rsquo;t notice since I lived there for two and half years without a car of my own.  Lived downtown, took an 8-minute metro ride to work.  Buses and cabs got you everywhere else you needed to go.  </p>
<p>My point was that the absence of highways downtown is one of the things that makes it a nice place to actually live, rather than just commute to.  Building an 8-lane superhighway through your city doesn&rsquo;t come without costs to the quality of life there.</p>
<p><i>Whites don&rsquo;t live in D.C. They prefer gated, guarded enclaves outside of Washington, in Georgetown, in Virginia. Why would they want to live in Washington D.C. with its crime, slums and squallor?</i> -Fed Up</p>
<p>Why?  Because the city really is beautiful, as ghw noted. It has one of the best urban environments the USA&rsquo;s got to offer.  You can&rsquo;t find it out in the suburbs.  Are whites supposed to permanently surrender this wonderful place?</p>
<p>And by the way, Georgetown (which is inside the DC limits) was once a &#8220;slum&#8221; filled with crime and squalor too.  The buildings were physically the same   &mdash;   it was the population that made it an undesirable place to live.  It got gentrified long before the rest, and the same process is now happening to many other parts of the city.</p>

<p>Thanks, Dave.  I&rsquo;m with you on this. <br>
Comparing  San Antonio to Washington is ridiculous (although SA&rsquo;s River Walk is extremely nice, I readily grant).  Otherwise, San Antonio may be good to drive THROUGH, but only on your way to SOMEPLACE ELSE!  It has the worst slums I&rsquo;ve ever seen in the USA.   But Washington was designed to live <i><b>in, </b></i> not drive  <i><b>through.</b></i><br>
  <br>
And Washington&rsquo;s layout is a masterpiece of city planning (for its era).   It&rsquo;s not &#8220;crazy&#8221; at all&hellip; it is extremely logical,  all geometric instead of hodgepodge, helterskelter development.   Of course, it was designed for visual satisfaction, not driving convenience.  It was laid out in the 1700s <i><b>before </b></i> anyone heard of the automobile.  And hopefully, it will still be there <i><b>after</b></i>  the automobile.  What will San Antonio&rsquo;s freeways be then but a vast wasted expense of baking concrete?  </p>
<p>PS. When I stayed at a hotel on the northside  freeway, I couldn&rsquo;t even cross over to a restaurant that was <i>directly on the opposite side. </i> I had to take a TAXI (!) to go a couple of miles AROUND. There were no overpasses! There were no sidewalks!  What a primitive place. I said never again.  I&rsquo;ll take Washington, muchas gracias por nada!</p>
<p>Oh oh!  Before I get the Texans after me, let me add that I do love Dallas  (especially the well-planned developments around Lake Caroline   &mdash;   excellent city planning of the 20th century).</p>

<p>Dear Anonymous:</p>
<p>The comment referred to Hillary Clinton and her position on health care. The comparison between Hollywood and Washington is that neither city is what it appears to be. Both entities have internal rules for themselves i.e. the Congressmen and movie producers, and external rules for everyone else. It was also a comment about my own developing disillusionment and arrogance.   </p>
<p>My comments, which I write for fun, are written to be factually true with respect to me personally, and also to be entertaining for a wide and [I hate to say it]diverse audience.  </p>

<p>Exactly.  If you want a crazy layout, look at your average suburban subdivision, with countless cul-de-sacs, loop roads that go nowhere, and not a single straight street. </p>
<p>I agree with your comment about the long-term value of highways, too.  Look at the Italian cities that still have their Roman street grids at the center.  Good planning endures.</p>

<p>Not sure where it was on this site, but there have been numerous articles and studies done on this subject in the last few years.  Check out Christopher Leinberger&rsquo;s article in the Atlantic Monthly for a good introduction:</p>
