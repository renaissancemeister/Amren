			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party could pose a major threat to Labour in the upcoming European elections, Labour&rsquo;s deputy leader Harriet Harman has said.</p>
<p>The BNP &#8220;are a bigger threat than they have been before&#8221;, she told the Independent newspaper in an interview.</p>
<p>She also outlined Labour&rsquo;s efforts to counter the BNP ahead of elections for the European Parliament in June.</p>
<p>Labour is &#8220;focused on the BNP in this election in a way it hasn&rsquo;t been previously,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Below the radar&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Labour is using the slogan &#8220;fairness not fear&#8221; in areas where there is heavy BNP activity, instead of its national banner &#8220;winning the fight for Britain&rsquo;s future&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is also working with anti-fascist groups and using anti-BNP &#8220;battlebuses&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ms Harman, who is also leader of the Commons and Labour&rsquo;s chairman, was speaking after a campaign visit to north-west England, where BNP leader Nick Griffin is a candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people are not aware the BNP is standing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is below the radar. There is very low public awareness of these elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, it is a question of pointing out the dangers of the BNP, which now wears suits but whose ideology is as pernicious as ever.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the Labour party that&rsquo;s dangerous. Its open-door third world immigration has exposed Britons to terrorism and crime.</p>

			<p>Labour is the fascist group here, because they jailed Mark Collett and Nick Griffin for speaking the truth about Islam. </p>

<p>Note from the above quote that it is &#8220;pernicious&#8221; to love your country, culture and people. Instead, you should love foreigners more than your own family.  It is pernicious to want to live without massive crime, taxes, and constant ethnic and religious conflict.  It is pernicious to want to bequeath your children a safe and prosperous country.  It is pernicious to want to save Britain (once one of the greatest Nations of all time) from sliding into Third World status, including economic, social, and environmental chaos.  Everyone already admits that Britain is already overpopulated.  In the future, Britain will face severe shortages of oil, food, and space, and importing millions of un-assimilatable Third Worlders will hasten this calamity. However, according to Labor, pointing all of these things out makes you &#8220;racists,&#8221; &#8220;hateful,&#8221; and pernicious.  Can you see how your enemy twists logic and reality around?  Love for your family becomes &#8220;hate.&#8221;  Your family&rsquo;s genocide becomes a &#8220;Great Benefit of Multiculturalism.&#8221;  It is truly an Orwellian world. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Labor deputy leader: BNP leaders wear suits, but they are as dangerous as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it.  The leftist diversity pigs have brought their country to near ruin and will probably be the cause of it&rsquo;s destruction, yet they&rsquo;re so mentally deranged they believe someone who practices sane policies, trust, and takes a bath daily is dangerous.<br/>

			<p>I visit the BNP site daily. What they&rsquo;re doing over there is something we need over here. They&rsquo;re not afraid to tell the truth [which is MUCH harder to do in England than it is here] and they&rsquo;re gaining alot of support. I sometimes post on their site and they are thrilled that someone in America is taking an interest in their party. The responses I get from my posts from them is one of brotherhood among &#8220;us&#8221; reguardless of nationality against the rising brown tide from the 3rd world. I would encourage my Amren brothers and sisters to visit their site to see how they&rsquo;re taking care of business. There are still alot of proud White British in England but, like here in our country, they&rsquo;re silenced by the media and their &#8220;leaders&#8221;.</p>

<p>Labour is not using the latter slogan because it does not want to be laughed out of the room.  The only party who cares about &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s future&#8221; is the BNP.</p>

			<p>this is good news. the more hysterical the liberals sound when they talk about the BNP, the more apparent it will become to the British public what they really think of democracy.</p>

			<p>Labour has disdain for whites who vote for them because Labour has hurt them over and over.  Over time, this turns from contempt to hate.  The same applies to the Republican presidential candidates and many senators.  Of course, its true of almost every white Democrat with some exceptions like Byrd of West Virginia.</p>

			<p>One day the media will have to mainstream these fringe right wing groups, instead of relegating them to unmentionable status. Imagine when the provocateurs hold the majority of the public vote? Some things just can&rsquo;t be stopped by anyone. </p>

			<p>I am not a BNP memebre just a spectator for <i>
<p>The BNP warned of the increasing fifth column of radical Muslims in Britain and the then looming financial crisis due to &#8220;toxic&#8221; debts with far too many maxing out their credit cards and the banks buying bad debts (USA sub-prime) but no one in power listened.  But the electorate has and is listening now. The beginning of the swing back to sanity perhaps in Britain?</p></i></p>

<p>Hmm - let&rsquo;s interpret that remark another way:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Brits are angrier about the wholesale give-away of their country than they have ever been before.&#8221;</p>
<p>More Pakistani &#8216;extremists&rsquo; caught planning a terror attack, crime sky-high, the formerly peaceful and orderly UK now the most overcrowded and crime-ridden country in Europe &hellip; how dare those British racists object &hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how in these media stories BNP members are seldom interviewed, or else get very few words in. They are treated like some microscopic germ under scientific observation.</p>
<p>I think the BNP&rsquo;s success in these elections will serve as a warning angry the voters truly are. It&rsquo;s not about the rest of the BNP&rsquo;s politics, whether you like them or not; or about whether the BNP is &#8220;racist.&#8221; The whole of the West is being overrun by immigrants unfriendly to us and our culture; immigrants who come from countries where <i>we</i> would not be tolerated for even a minute. They must be stopped. David Cameron ad his friends won&rsquo;t really act to stop them unless they see how serious the voters truly are.</p>
<p>If you believe in less immigration then the BNP is the only way to vote. It&rsquo;s not just about Britain&rsquo;s future. The fate of the whole West lies in the hands of every Briton. It&rsquo;s 1940 all over again. From Agincourt to the Falklands, don&rsquo;t let the lives of every British soldier go to waste.</p>

			<p>The conventional wisdom in England is that the BNP will take most of its votes away from Labor.  But I don&rsquo;t know if I believe that, because of a recent spate of vitriol coming from Tory-biased papers like the Daily Mail.  Several weeks ago, The Mail had a long piece about the &#8220;return of fascism&#8221; in Europe, i.e. they complained about European nationalist parties, including the BNP.   That is among several swipes the Mail has made toward the BNP in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Why should a Tory paper care that a party that is supposedly going to take away Labor votes gets stronger?  Answer:  Because the BNP will take votes away from the Conservatives, too, or at least they think it. </p>

			<p>So the BNP constantly warned about pakistani involvement in UK terror plots and were branded racist. The government just arrested a dozen so called &#8216;students&rsquo;. The BNP constantly warned about bogus african &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; flooding into UK from france. Now the UK and french governments are trying to seal the leaky border. The BNP constantly warned about muslim immigrant families being given council (social) housing on arrival to UK and paid for by the taxpayer. Now British people who have been on the waiting list for years have been told they will never get to the top of the queque unless millions of new homes are built in our countryside. Time and time again these BNP warnings have been given but no mainstream publicity is given, especially on BBC TV and the print media. That&rsquo;s why the BNP website has proved so popular, so much so that the BNP are asking for more staff to deal with the increased workload and to stand as candidates in local elections. You can read all about it online. The EU elections are held the first week of June, the BNP have already qualified for several seats but more local election successes will put more in the European parliament. Bout time too. It&rsquo;s so sad that the only political party to root for British people in Britain are put down as racist for defending their homeland. Who else will do it? Not the present government.</p>

			<p>The only &#8216;threat&rsquo; to Great Britain and its people is the government&rsquo;s lunatic immigration policy! Halt all immigration. Deport all immigrants and watch your crime rate plummet.</p>

			<p><i>Labour is using the slogan &ldquo;fairness not fear&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s &#8220;fair&#8221; to deny a man work as a policeman, or as a prison warden, or in a hospital, because he belongs to an opposition political party.  It&rsquo;s pretty clear who the dangerous guys in suits really are.<br/>
