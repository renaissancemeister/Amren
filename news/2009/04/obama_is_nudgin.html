			<p>So two-thirds of whites still say the country is on the wrong track. Perhaps another 1,500 days of Obama and gang, plus the secret ballot, will cause whites to change their opinion on black rule. I suspect they are beginning to, albeit in private, but the resistance to our standing up is becoming ever more fierce. Still the MSM has started printing forthright responses by whites to some articles and editorials  &mdash;  scant difference, often!</p>

			<p>Oh what fun and fantasy, we do have here!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-thirds of Americans now say race relations are generally good&hellip; .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But is that because of Comrade BO, or a generalized dysgenics of the American population, particularly the white population? As any who are white and sane, I would hold the latter over the former, since about 40% or so of the white population were: stupid enough, lazy enough, and abjectly disgusting enough, to vote for Comrade BO in the first place. Enough said here!</p>
<p>Next,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite that, half of blacks still say whites have a better chance of getting ahead in American society, the poll found. Black Americans remain among the president&rsquo;s staunchest supporters; 70 percent of black respondents now say the country is headed in the right direction, compared with 34 percent of whites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Utterly amazing, maybe whites are not such a lost cause after all; only 34% wish to compound their stupidity, with an open admission of probable mental retardation.</p>
<p>As for the blacks, I am surprised that 30% of them have the brains to realize that the country isn&rsquo;t moving toward a ghetto Xanadu for them. God only knows what the other 70% are thinking, but we all have a good idea: they probably think that they are about to be &ldquo;gettins&rdquo; reparations and 5 white slaves to augment that windfall of underserved loot. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Whites working for White goals??  If Whites were working for White goals there would be no Blacks taking jobs from Whites via affirmative action.  If Whites were working for White goals the Civil Rights era would never have gotten out of control like it did.  If Whites were working for White goals they&rsquo;d be doing something about the over 100,000 rapes of White women by Black men in the last 4 years.  If Whites were working for White goals it would not be allowed for any White to be labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; simply for wanting to preserve their own race.  If Whites were working for White goals there would be dozens of organization by and for White people and White people only.  If Whites were working for White goals &hellip;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this poll at all. </p>
<p>IMO, Blacks are more racist/race conscious as ever, and Whites are have either been browbeaten into saying race relations are good, or as I suspect, are mad as hell and are finally becoming racially conscious.</p>
<p>I live in L.A., and work around allot of non-Whites, many of which are Black. Race is the topic 75% of their conversations. It&rsquo;s endless, every single day. White man this, Mexican woman that. On and on, it&rsquo;s all about race with them.</p>
<p>Whites are finally waking up to the fact that ALL other races have their best interests in mind. Only Whites have had this bizarre suicidal tendency to downgrade our own race. The times are changing. Whites are finally waking up.<br>

			<p>70 to 34%?  Doesn&rsquo;t sound to me like Whites think that the country is headed in the right direction. And we all know which WHITES were in that 34%.  As for race relations being better? What a joke. There is even more black on White crime now more than ever!</p>

<p>Now everybody is working for black goals.  Considering the source of this story is from one of America&rsquo;s premium bird cage liners, treat it with a grain of salt.  I get the impression out in the real world that Obama has made race relations worse. </p>

<p>True.  But notice they don&rsquo;t give a valid reason as to why whites have a better chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>Whites have more intelligence, a better work ethic, more all around ability, and they&rsquo;re more innovative, adventurous and creative.  </p>
<p>A free society will always mean blacks will be at the bottom, regarding accomplishment of all the races.  That&rsquo;s why most of them love communism.  They can get something that somebody else worked for without contributing anything themselves.</p>

			<p>The New York Times lies to itself about everything. First comes<br>
the liberal agenda..then the facts are manufactured to support it.  And above all it lies to itself about its own popularity.<br>
What does the readership curve look like&hellip;? Like a stock chart<br>
of General Motors, AIG, or CitiBank? Its only a matter of time before the &#8220;shocking&#8221; news of NYT declaring bankruptcy comes out.</p>

			<p>What Whites are really saying is that they figure that Blacks ought to be happy now.  No intelligent adult is going to change their views on race, just because the new errand boy for corporate interests is a Mulatto.  <br>
     This past week, I had a conversation with an old friend of my wife&rsquo;s, a lifelong government employee, liberal Democrat, and Unitarian.  I was pleasingly shocked to hear her views on &#8220;drunk Mexicans&#8221;, the pointlessness of a college education, and the possibility that Hispanics are genetically less intelligent than Whites.  <br>
     Among Whites, only the fanatics and the brainwashed young actually believe in multi-culturalism.  Most White liberals are simply liars.</p>

			<p>This article is a work of fiction.  I notice they didn&rsquo;t mention the astonshing stats of black on white crime, recent comments made by AG Holder about us being a nation of cowards on the issue of race, not to mention most of the MSM practically calling tea party protester&rsquo;s a bunch of racists. I would argue that racial tensions are high as ever.</p>

			<p>One has to take these polls with a grain of salt&hellip;at best. Simply put, most Americans - White, Black, Brown, Yellow - are politically clueless to an embarassing degree! Even those who aren&rsquo;t nakedly(and often proudly)apathetic, are generally limited to parroting talk-radio and FNC gibber-jabber on the one side, or regurgitating MSM and lefty blog talking points on the other. Precious few dare wade into that murky area of actually thinking for oneself, rejecting party politics and fully embracing&hellip;(gasp)reality - nasty taboos and all!! </p>
<p>Thus, what most Americans think politically is effectively meaningless, whether discussing race, finance, foreign policy or what have you. It is a sad truth most here know all too well. </p>

			<p>I used to be one of those people who thought there was a silver lining to the Obama Presidency:  Namely, that Whites would no longer buy into the White-guilt phenomenon, and that blacks would be less quick to blame Whites for every malady.  </p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong.  The Obama Presidency has had the opposite effect.  Blacks feel more entitled than ever to positions of power and influence.  Now they say, &#8220;Hey, a black man is President, and this shows we&rsquo;re just as capable as Whites.  If we don&rsquo;t have proportionate [fill in the blank: jobs, education, etc.] then it must be because of racism, not anything to do with ability.&#8221;  And Whites are feeling more guilty than ever   &mdash;   even though they put a black man in the White House!   &mdash;   for the continued dismal performance of blacks in all social and economic activities.     </p>

<p>Yes of course whites are waking up, it is perfectly natural and you should also consider the fact that whites will one day be a minority in America. Look at South Africa for example. Most of the white South Africans I know don&rsquo;t take any nonsense from blacks and are not afraid to admit that blacks are as racist as anybody else. Does the average white south african hate blacks? no I don&rsquo;t think so, but they certainly know the truth about blacks where as white Americans are being brainwashed by the television and a false sense of reality. I also think that everyone is kissing obama&rsquo;s behind simply because he is black&hellip;..how racist is that? maybe he will be a good president but then again maybe he won&rsquo;t&hellip;..it&rsquo;s way too early for all this hype.<br>

			<p>It takes an IQ of at least 90 in order to graduate from High School. At least it does if you are to comprehend the material. Whites have an average IQ of about 100. Blacks have an average IQ of about 85. More than half of the Black population do not have the ability to comprehend High School material. Thirty percent or so of the Black population is basically unemployable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite that, half of blacks still say whites have a better chance of getting ahead in American society, the poll found.&#8221;<br>

<p>I agree with your post 100%. I too (unfortunately) work with a large number of non-Whites, especially blacks. Race is the only thing they ever focus on or think about. Blacks filter evrything through the prism of race. They are obsessed with race.</p>

			<p>We have the &#8220;same goals&#8221;? NO. My goal is to live in a safe, educated community, filled with hardworking people. This means a community filled with Europeans and perhaps a few Asians. That&rsquo;s it. No one else. Thanks to Lyndon Johnson and JFK, the American dream was smashed by the socialist civil rights laws. The public schools and colleges denigrate any student who shows pride in European civilization. And when Martin Luther King is propped up as a greater hero than Washington, Lee or Eisenhower, we are truly lost.</p>

			<p>What is it about the Obama Administration&rsquo;s first 3 months performance gives anyone hope?</p>
<p>The collapse of the stock market? The appointment of large numbers of tax dodgers to cabinet positions? The appointment of a convicted thief to his top technology position? The gift of  billion dollars to the idiots in Palestine? The full butt-in-the-air bow to the Saudi potentate? The shafting of the British prime minister? The squandering of trillions of dollars in American wealth on useless government programs? The massive expansion of the welfare state? The reliance of Obama on his teleprompter to say anything that sounds even quasi-intelligent? The government coercion of the banking industry? The government mishandling of the auto industry bailout? The passing the buck to junior staffers for every one of his mistakes?</p>
<p>What of any of that gives anyone hope for Obama&rsquo;s presidency?</p>

			<p>It seems to me that now, more than ever before, blacks are working for the black agenda and the whites are still helping them. Although, some things have not changed and that is that blacks will always vote for a black even if he has them skinned for doing so. Whites have become dreamers where race is concerned. They want the races to get along, even if they have to be killed by a black to prove that it will never happen. </p>

<p>I have a lot of middle aged friends who grew up in New York.  They go back every couple years for holidays and to visit family.</p>
<p>They tell me that there are more and more non English speaking, non White foreigners every year. Even in midtown manhattan it is rare to hear English spoken.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason why NYT readership is going down.  The non English speaking, non whites from illiterate cultures so beloved and exhalted by the NYT can&rsquo;t read the NYT!!!!!</p>
<p>That is a big reason why circulation is going down.  Same thing in California cities.  Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno, Bakersfield and other cities just don&rsquo;t have enough English reading population to support the papers.</p>
<p>But they continue to publish their hate White Americans glorify non White immigrants and black American criminals agenda.</p>
<p>At least 6 or 7 times a month the Los Angeles Times runs one of those love stories to the black thug who committed the latest atrocity articles.</p>
<p>Everbody has seen these articles.  5 or 6 full pages devoted to the thug.  His weeping 300 pound project mama.  The 6th grade graduation picture.  The political pimp of a pastor.  The kindergarten teacher who has something good to say about him.</p>
<p>And of course the tax payer funded community activist who snivels &#8220;Don&rsquo;t make a good boy bad by convicting and imprisoning him.&#8221;  &#8220;Send him to our tax payer rip off gangster reform program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exonerating black criminals while ignoring their victims and accusing the (mostly minority) police of racism for arresting the black criminals is no way to build circulation.</p>
<p>The MSM needs to do some surveys Re who actually reads newspapers. Hint;  it&rsquo;s not black thugs, the project mamas and the political pimps.  It&rsquo;s the Whites who are the victims of the black thugs.</p>

			<p>The biggest white delusion going is that blacks and Hispanics have the same white goals. Be a decent person, have a nuclear family, go to school get a good job succeed by your own merit and pass down something your children can be proud of. Those are white goals that too many whites assume everybody else shares. </p>
<p>Blacks absolutely do not have those goals. Blacks want to get laid, get paid, and get over on the man by any means necessary and hopefully not involving too much actual work. If they get to scream and holler and beat people up once in a while, that&rsquo;s a bonus in their book. Hispanics are less different from whites, but ultimately they want a Hispanics-only living space. They want whitey out, just like they want whitey out of their home countries too. </p>
<p>Whites are mostly still in la la land as usual. I have noticed more couples with a black male and a white female, both looking relatively educated and well groomed. I doubt those couples will last long. 400 years of history says those couples will not stay together and the babies will be dumped into the black community sooner or later. </p>
<p>People on this site make a big deal out of race mixing, but the reality is that not much race mixing has happened and probably never will happen. Even liberal whites want white babies for the most part, even if they don&rsquo;t say that. </p>
<p>The hardcore leftists are pushing for some kind of crazy society where the races live side by side but all the minorities somehow keep their competing group identities forever. That&rsquo;s completely untenable and much more unnatural and jarring than general race mixing (which would make an inferior but at least more harmonious society). It&rsquo;s like forcefully pushing together many mutually repulsing magnets. I guess the Marxists assume it would give lots of jobs for a bloated government bureaucracy to manage all that incompetence, bickering, and constant ethnic jockeying. </p>
<p>Most fashionable liberals have no idea what this really entails, because all they know from life is that one nice black couple in their country club. Those naive liberals are useful idiots for the hardcore leftists, nothing more. </p>
<p>The issue that is pushing all this is going to be taxes. The taxpaying whites, no matter how idealistic and naive they are, just aren&rsquo;t going to have money to support a multi-racial Marxist bureaucratic utopia for much longer. It will end as soon as the money runs out, starting with Taxifornia. </p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t LIKE or DISLIKE Obama because he&rsquo;s Black. Obama will be judged by what good or harm he does for Americans. So give him at least a year before trying to judge the man.</p>
