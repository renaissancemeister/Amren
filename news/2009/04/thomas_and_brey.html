<h1><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202430233762">Thomas and Breyer Discuss Supreme Court Clerk Diversity at Budget Hearing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Mauro, Legal Times, April 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A perennial topic at the Supreme Court&rsquo;s budget hearings  &mdash;  at least since Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., chair of the House subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Court&rsquo;s budget, has been on the panel  &mdash;  is the need to increase the number of minority law clerks serving the justices. Since the dearth of minority clerks was first quantified in 1998, several members of Congress have asked the justices about it, but none more persistently than Serrano.</p>
<p>&#8220;What progress is being made?&#8221; Serrano asked Justices Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas at the hearing last week. &#8220;The more diversity, the better.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>This time the justices came prepared for the law clerk question. Though the Court emphatically does not keep statistics on the demographics of its law clerks, Thomas said that, judging by the photos in the employee directory, there are &#8220;four or so&#8221; minorities (and 13 women) among the 36 law clerks hired this term. Last year, he said, the number of minorities was six or seven. Since 1998, the number of minority clerks has been as high as nine and as low as zero.</p>
<p>Thomas said that even though he casts &#8220;a broad net&#8221; beyond the usual law schools in his search for clerks, &#8220;there&rsquo;s not a plethora&#8221; of minority candidates to hire. While expressing discomfort at using racial categories, he said that finding qualified Asians, including Indians, for clerkships is &#8220;not a problem. We&rsquo;re talking about blacks and Hispanics&#8221; as the groups that are most difficult to tap.</p>
<p>But Breyer, who usually hires at least one or two minorities as clerks each year, chimed in that he has no problem finding top minority candidates anymore. When he started on the Court in 1994, Breyer says he had to use &#8220;conscious outreach&#8221; to find quality candidates, but now &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have to make an outreach to get the good candidates.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Renquist had the best solution to race hustlers.  Blacks demanded a meeting to &#8220;discuss&#8221; why he didn&rsquo;t have any black law clerks, and he refused to meet with them.  And you know what?  They went away.  If people would stand up to these jerks, they would just give up and go home. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Thomas: No problem finding Asians; but &ldquo;not a plethora&rdquo; of qualified blacks and Hispanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Breyer isn&rsquo;t fit to sit on the Supreme Court.  He&rsquo;s as screwy as Ginsburg, and she&rsquo;s a disgrace.  Even the other justices have complained about her.</p>
<p>But look for the court to surge further to the left into weirdom, since anybody the messiah appoints is going to be as goofy and radical as his other appointments.  He&rsquo;ll probably get to appoint two.</p>
<p>When we look at the overall direction this country is heading, economic collapse seems like a blessing.<br>

			<p>What Breyer means is that he&rsquo;s willing to look outside the cream of the crop to find minimally qualified minority candidates.  Thomas is just being honest.  Suffice it to say, AA candidates are unlikely to finish in the top 3% or so of their class or get brilliant notes published in their college&rsquo;s law journal.  </p>
<p>The SCt. may find a couple of qualified hispanics in a given year, most likely &#8220;hispanics&#8221; of affluent primarily european heritage, but they may have to get creative to find a legitimately qualified candidate who happens to be black.  How many black law students in a given year finish in top 3% or so of their class at an elite law school?  Probably not too many.</p>

			<p>Obama will get to elect THREE more to the Court. Souter is leaving and Ginsburg and Stevens will be next to leave. We can all guess who he will appoint. More than likely someone in their 40&rsquo;s who will sit on that bench for another 50 years! This nation is no longer the America that was envisioned by our Founders. Hear the Obama wants an appointee with &#8220;empathy&#8221; and not a word about knowledge of the Constitution! Here comes marriage for the homosexuals nationwide, not to mention reparations for all the blacks.</p>
