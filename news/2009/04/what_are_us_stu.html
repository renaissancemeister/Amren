<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0422/p09s01-coop.html">What Are US Students Learning About Islam?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Bauer, Christian Science Monitor, April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In his 2008 study &#8220;Islam in the Classroom: what the textbooks tell us,&#8221; Gilbert Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council (ATC), reviewed 10 of the nation&rsquo;s most widely used junior and senior high school history textbooks. {snip}</p>
<p>At a time when America is locked in a battle of ideas with Islamic extremists and other enemies of freedom, accurate knowledge is indispensable. Yet, Sewall&rsquo;s findings underscore how political correctness is distorting the next generation&rsquo;s understanding of this battle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sewall found that many textbooks gloss over or delete important facts. For example, in the 1990s, &#8220;jihad&#8221;  &mdash;  which has many meanings, among them &#8220;sacred&#8221; or &#8220;holy&#8221; struggle but also &#8220;holy war&#8221;  &mdash;  was defined in the Houghton Mifflin junior high school book only as a struggle &#8220;to do one&rsquo;s best to resist temptation and overcome evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The many acts of violence committed on behalf of Islam in the past decade have made that definition incomplete, to say the least. Yet, as ATC notes, &#8220;by 2005, Houghton Mifflin apparently had removed jihad from its entire series of social studies textbooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In discussing sharia law, the Islamic code that can be used to subjugate women and deal death to wayward believers, many textbooks are intentionally vague. Holt Rinehart Winston&rsquo;s 2006 &#8220;Medieval to Early Modern Times&#8221; junior high textbook states simply, &#8220;[Sharia] sets rewards for good behavior and punishments for crimes.&#8221; Another popular history textbook states, &#8220;Muslim law requires that Muslim leaders offer religious toleration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Descriptions of Islam since 9/11 are particularly disturbing. Though Islamic extremism has become a fact of life throughout much of the world, most of the reviewed textbooks suggest instead that poverty, ignorance, and the existence of Israel are at the root of terrorism. The closest that any textbook gets to suggesting a faith-based component to terrorism is Glencoe&rsquo;s &#8220;Modern Times,&#8221; which states broadly that &#8220;Muslims have not accommodated their religious beliefs to the modern world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whitewashing of Islam becomes even more noticeable when contrasted with how history textbooks treat Christianity. One book describes the Crusades as &#8220;religious wars launched against Muslims by European Christians.&#8221; But when Muslims attacked Christians and took their land, the process is referred to as &#8220;building&#8221; an empire.</p>
<p>A McDougal Littell volume claims that non-Muslims in Muslim-ruled territories converted to Islam because &#8220;they were attracted by Islam&rsquo;s message of equality and hope for salvation.&#8221; A good history class should teach students to ask critical questions. Are students asking how much of that &#8220;conversion&#8221; was coerced by the sword? Sadly, most texts gloss over Muslim leaders&rsquo; history of enslavement of &#8220;infidels&#8221; and their brutal treatment of women, which continues today in some countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sewall says the pressure tactics used by some Muslim groups on publishers to portray Islam in a favorable light amount to a kind of &#8220;cultural jihad.&#8221; This essentially is what the founder of the Council on Islamic Education, the main Islamic group for vetting textbooks in America, was saying when he described his work as a &#8220;bloodless revolution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. inside American junior high and high school classrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewall understands that historical inaccuracies sometimes take decades to be written out of textbooks. &#8220;Once lies are written into textbooks,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they tend to be perpetuated in new editions.&#8221; Which is one reason why Sewall will continue to make his case to publishers.</p>

			<p>Reason number 10 million to home school your kids now! If you cannot homeschool then find a small private school where you can evaluate the curriculum before enrolling your child. Forget about so called charter or magnet schools, they are just experiments before placing the flawed teaching methods and subject matter into regular public schools. Even if you cannot afford it, ask for a discount or any sort of scholarship. Your child&rsquo;s future is too precious to trust it to public schools. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that.  With the way public school teachers are proselytizing Islam, which they wouldn&rsquo;t do for Christianity and Judaism, Islam has become the de facto official religion of the American public school system.</p>
<p>I think American public schools are siding with Islam largely for racial reasons, because of the non-white versus white global dynamic.</p>

			<p>What an ugly time to be a school student. I&rsquo;m glad I graduated in 2000.</p>
<p>And I agree with the homeschooling thing. I also think we know more than enough about Islam to know we don&rsquo;t want it in our societies or our lives.</p>

What they won&rsquo;t learn is that Muhammad married a 6 year old girl and was &#8216;admitted to his house&rsquo; when she was 9.</p>
<p>They also won&rsquo;t learn that the reward of a pious life is sex.</p>
<p>At least in Christianity, the joy of eternal life is found being in the presence of God, not carnal lust. Simply being in the presence of God is the greatest reward. Can muslims claim that of Allah?</p>

			<p>Part of this is to act out a need for consistency. If the white man is shown as the villain in every other instance, then anyone and anything that opposes him must be good. It is also an attempt to deny the reality  of 9/11. Rather than face up to the ill will the Moslem world holds for the rest of us, it is easier to say we are to blame it for it due to crimes committed by our ancestors. Rewriting history also allows the schools to present a fairytale in which Moslems were benign masters of Christians (or former Christians). Which is easier, afterall: To face up to the Moslem threat or pretend that Islam is the religion of peace?</p>

			<p>Islamic people aren&rsquo;t coming to the U.S., Canada and Europe to assimilate.</p>
<p>They want us to adapt to them.</p>
<p>If Islam is so wonderful why did they flee their former countries?</p>

			<p>I can understand why Liberals and Feminists would promote the immigration of Orientals, Indians, and Hispanics. These replace White men economically, with little or no injury to Liberalism and Feminism. In the case of Islamic immigration, I don&rsquo;t know why Liberals or Feminists believe it to be in their interest.</p>
<p>They must know that Islam is a great threat to their control of the Western nations, and the main obstacle to Liberal and Feminist expansions to non-Western nations. Yet, they continue to promote the importation of Muslims, and cooperate with the Muslim immigrants in preserving their anti-Liberal and anti-Feminist activisms. By the way, politics is considered an important part of Islam. &#8220;Separation of Church and State&#8221; is as foolish  to Islam as &#8220;humane treatment of animals&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any enlightenment on this matter would be appreciated.</p>

			<p>FEMINIST: the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes </p>
<p>&#8220;Alienated-American&#8221;, being a feminist does not automatically put you in the category of liberal. I know many people, like myself, who consider themselves both a feminist and a conservative.</p>

			<p>Americans learned all they needed to know about Islam on 9/11. In fact, they learn everyday since and I&rsquo;m afraid 9/11 wasn&rsquo;t the last time.</p>

			<p>I wish all U.S. students could know what I know about the muslims now, having spent 5 years among them. Even silly black converts don&rsquo;t know the real muslim ideaology.</p>
