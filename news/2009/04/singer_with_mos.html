			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fran Yeoman,Times of London, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A singer with Germany&rsquo;s most successful girl band has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm by infecting a partner with HIV.</p>
<p>Nadja Benaissa, who sold more than 5 million records and performed concerts around the world with No Angels, is alleged to have had unprotected sex with three people without telling them that she was HIV positive.</p>
<p>At least one man has since found he has the virus.</p>
<p>Benaissa, 26, a mother of one, became a celebrity overnight when she and four other young women won the first German series of the talent television show Popstars in 2000.</p>
<p>They formed No Angels, who were said to have been modelled on the Spice Girls, and went on to have a string of No 1 hits. Their popularity was such that in 2002, Ms Benaissa spoke publicly of her worries that the group may have become too famous. &#8220;If you see No Angels in every newspaper, on every television station and hear them on every radio station, the people will at some point get sick and tired of No Angels,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The group split in December 2003 before four of the original five members, including Benaissa, reformed in 2007. They were selected to represent Germany at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest with their single Disappear but finished last.</p>
<p>Benaissa, who was born in Germany and has a Moroccan father, was arrested in Frankfurt on Saturday evening shortly before she was due to give a solo performance. She was remanded in custody after a judge ruled that there was a danger she might repeat her alleged offence.</p>
<p>The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office in the western town of Darmstadt said that the singer was being held because of the &#8220;urgent suspicion that the accused had unprotected sexual intercourse with three people in the years 2004 and 2006 without telling them beforehand that she was HIV positive&#8221;.</p>
<p>If found guilty she could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

			<p>Many may not realize this but the horrid Grammy frauds from twenty years ago, Milli Vanilli, originated in Germany. All white countries seems to have at least a small number of producers who seemingly scour every back alleyway to find somebody mixed race to put up on stage.</p>

In other words, AIDS has to happen to a cheerleader for Jamestown to consider it something truly worth fear and worry. That is not a problem unique to Jamestown. This is the legacy of AIDS: People may say, &#8220;AIDS can happen to anyone,&#8221; but deep inside they&rsquo;re still thinking, &#8220;It can&rsquo;t happen to me.&#8221; There&rsquo;s always a way to make it about someone else. Gays. Drug users. People who hang out with gays and drug users. Blacks and Hispanics in big-city ghettos. White trash.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Race-idealists are just dying for an AIDS outbreak among middle-class whites.  Anything to prove their faulty premise that AIDS is &#8220;the disease that doesn&rsquo;t discrimminate.&#8221;  But stastics show just the opposite: Avoid heroin addicts, gays and (male) bisexuals, and blacks, and there is very little reason to worry about HIV.  Don&rsquo;t tempt fate; use protection, use common sense, but if you&rsquo;re doing the right things, there really isn&rsquo;t much of a reason to get paranoid about something that is unlikely to affect you.  </p>

			<p> This is a sad commentary on contemporary Germany that this singer was from Germany&rsquo;s &#8220;most successful girl band.&#8221; She is not German but is consider as such by German law. I&rsquo;d really rather not speculate about how she acquired HIV but I can imagine the quality of the people she associated with  &mdash;  &#8220;No Angels&#8221; indeed.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this story.  You REALLY have to work at it to achieve female to male HIV transmission.  It&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>

Only if the woman in question doesn&rsquo;t have additional STDs causing sores and skin breaks.  I&rsquo;ll bet she picks up STDs as often as I pick up lettuce at the grocery store, and she obviously doesn&rsquo;t let active STDs interfere with her sex life.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that all major STDs are epidemic among blacks - for instance, half of adult blacks in New York are estimated to have genital herpes.  The STD &#8220;Trich&#8221; is almost entirely non-white in the US (which is why most people have never heard of it), and per the CDC &#8220;having trichomoniasis may increase the chance that an HIV-infected woman passes HIV to her sex partner(s).&#8221;  <br>

<p>In the US, &#8220;In 2006, the rate of chlamydia cases among black women was more than seven times that of white women; the gonorrhea rate among African-American women was 18 times greater than for whites; and the rate of syphilis cases in black women was 16 times higher than in white women.&#8221;  http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2008/04/black-teen-std.html</p>
