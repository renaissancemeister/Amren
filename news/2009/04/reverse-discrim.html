<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0423/p02s01-usju.html">Reverse-Discrimination Case Splits Supreme Court</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Warren Richey, Christian Science Monitor, April 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The US Supreme Court divided into sharply defined liberal and conservative wings on Wednesday as the high court heard argument in a case [Ricci v. DeStafano] involving allegations of reverse discrimination against white firefighters in New Haven, Conn.</p>
<p>As in most highly divisive issues at the high court, the outcome of the case may ultimately depend on the views of Justice Anthony Kennedy. During the 70-minute oral argument Wednesday, Justice Kennedy seemed troubled by the city&rsquo;s decision to throw out all results of a promotion exam only after officials learned that no African-American candidates had scored high enough to be promoted.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The city] looked at the results, and it classified the successful and unsuccessful applicants by race,&#8221; Kennedy told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler. &#8220;And you want us to say this isn&rsquo;t [using] race [to decide].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have trouble with this argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case is significant because it lies at the intersection of two important provisions of antidiscrimination law and could provide further clarity to employers seeking to avoid potential discrimination lawsuits.</p>
<p>It focuses on a test given in 2003 to firefighters seeking promotion to lieutenant and captain. When the city determined that no African-American candidates qualified for a promotion it threw out the results. White and Hispanic firefighters who did qualify called it illegal discrimination and filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The city says it threw out the test in an effort to comply with civil rights laws, not violate them. New Haven officials said they were worried that if they relied on the results of the test and promoted the white firefighters, the city might be vulnerable to a lawsuit by black firefighters claiming that the test caused an illegal &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; against minority job candidates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it is frequently difficult to prove that an employer is engaged in intentional discrimination. For this reason, Congress has also empowered victims of discrimination to sue in instances when an employment practice results in a disparate impact against members of a protected minority group.</p>
<p>Ricci v. DeStefano involves both sides of Title VII. The white and Hispanic firefighters are suing for what they say is intentional discrimination by the city, while the city justifies its decision to throw out the test results on grounds that it was only seeking to prevent a violation of the disparate impact side of Title VII.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The disparate impact section of the law is a prophylactic against intentional discrimination, [Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler] Kneedler said. It is designed to encourage employers to self-police their employment practices by halting and correcting any practice that might result in a disparate impact against minority workers, he said.</p>
<p>The justices were divided over whether the completed employment test should have been so easily discarded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Chief Justice John Roberts said New Haven&rsquo;s position, if adopted, would create a &#8220;blank check to discriminate&#8221; against white employees.</p>
<p>One recurring issue during the argument was whether employees who pass a promotion test are entitled to not have the test thrown out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The firefighters&rsquo; lawyer, Gregory Coleman, told the justices that the city threw his client&rsquo;s high-ranking test scores out based on a mere &#8220;good faith belief&#8221; that the city might be sued. He said the city should have to demonstrate more to justify the adverse action against his clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our firefighters had already taken the test; they had earned their promotions under state law,&#8221; he said.</p>

								<h2>High Court Asked to Untangle Reverse Discrimination Case</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Bill Mears, CNN, April 22, 4009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s conservative majority expressed varying degrees of concern Wednesday over a civil rights case brought by 20 firefighters, most of them white, who claim reverse discrimination in promotions.</p>
<p>The suit was filed in response to New Haven, Connecticut, officials&rsquo; decision to throw out results of promotional exams that they said left too few minorities qualified.</p>
<p>At issue is whether the city intentionally discriminated, in violation of both federal law and the Constitution&rsquo;s equal protection clause.</p>
<p>The high court is being asked to decide whether there is a continued need for special treatment for minorities, or whether enough progress has been made to make existing laws obsolete, especially in a political atmosphere where an African-American occupies the White House.</p>
<p>As is true in many hot-button social issues, Wednesday&rsquo;s arguments fell along familiar ideological lines, with most justices expressing clear views on when race considerations are proper to ensure a diverse workplace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotional exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in New Haven, Connecticut&rsquo;s second-largest city. The personnel department contracted with a private firm to design an oral and written exam. When the results came back, city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam would have been promoted.</p>
<p>The New Haven corporation counsel refused to certify the test and no promotions were given. The record does not indicate how many firefighters took the two tests for promotion to captain and lieutenant.</p>
<p>The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII, employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on a protected class, such as a specified race or gender.</p>
<p>But a group of firefighters sued, calling themselves the &#8220;New Haven 20.&#8221; The plaintiffs, wearing their dress blue uniforms, posed on the high court steps after the 75-minute argument. Nineteen identify themselves as white while one says he is Hispanic-white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens suggested that if there were a choice of two tests, one of which had a lesser &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on minorities, &#8220;they could take that test, even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial proportionality in candidates selected.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firefighters&rsquo; attorney, Greg Coleman, countered by saying the city&rsquo;s action in this instance &#8220;violates the principle of individual dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kennedy&rsquo;s views could prove key. He appeared to oppose the city&rsquo;s dismissal of the test results and has traditionally been skeptical of many race-based decisions in education and the workplace. But his more moderate views could blunt the impact of any ruling by his more right-leaning colleagues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama administration also has taken a nuanced position on the appeal. A Justice Department lawyer told the high court that while the federal government supports the city&rsquo;s discretion to nullify the test results, it believes the lawsuit should be allowed to proceed on a limited basis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case is Ricci v. DeStefano (07-1428). A ruling is expected in about two months.<br>

			<p>The liberal side of the court should not be able to have their cake and eat it to. If they are in favor of allowing discrimination against whites then they should also have no problem with allowing discrimination against blacks or anybody else.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch the liberal side squirm as they attempt to justify how rewarding employees based upon merit is unjust but rewarding employees based upon race is just.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s leftist Wikipedia&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact" rel="nofollow">disparate impact</a>&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>Adverse impact is also known as an unintentional form of discrimination, which occurs when identical standards or procedures are applied to everyone, despite the fact that they lead to a substantial difference in employment outcomes for the members of a particular group and they are unrelated to success on a job. An important thing to note is that adverse impact is not illegal.[5] Adverse impact only becomes illegal if the employer cannot justify the employment practice causing the adverse impact as a &#8220;job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity&#8221; (1964/1991 Civil Rights Act, Section 2000e-2[k][1][A]).</i></p>
<p>The New Haven fire department&rsquo;s act (throwing out the test results) had a disparate impact on white firefighters.  Assuming the article is accurate, if their lawyers can show that the fire department &#8220;cannot justify the employment practice causing the adverse impact as a &#8216;job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity&rsquo;&#8221; (sic), then surely NHFD&rsquo;s action was illegal and thus actionable.</p>
<p>I should&rsquo;ve been a lawyer.  I bet white &#8220;civil rights&#8221; are a vast, untapped gold mine.  If I was a lawyer I&rsquo;d be in court 24/7 for suits like that.</p>

None of the justices every asks the right questions such as,</p>
<p>Can the defense give examples of which questions on the test are discriminatory?</p>
<p>If not, what is the source and proof of this discrimination?</p>
<p>Are African-Americans being denied access to study material, lectures, or private study time?</p>
<p>How is outcome proof of discrimination?</p>
<p>If all access to resources are the same, is it possible that the differences in outcome might be the result of whites studying more and putting greater effort into passing these tests?</p>
<p>As those questions and watch the defense stammer and crumble.<br>

<p>That is especially the case when it doesn&rsquo;t even exist. Luckily legal inventions like &#8220;disparate impact discrimination&#8221; exist which allows disgruntled minorities to bankrupt their employers even when no discrimination actually exists.  Coddle your minority employees or face the wrath of legions of trial lawyers.</p>

<p>What would be most fitting here (at least, as a glowing testament as to just how insane our &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; society has become,) would be if the white and Hispanics did win their case and then sued the city of New Haven for millions, and then they blacks, turned around and repeated the process. In short, that would prove equality of outcomes for all by legal fiats, if not the &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of genetic &ldquo;equality&rdquo;</p>

			<p>May no mistake. This court can write around common sense at anytime and has done so routinely by using obfuscatory language that no one can understand. The problem here however, is not discrimination, the law, political correctness, affirmative action, or any of their other literary excuses in refuse. The problem here, now, is simple economics!</p>
<p>These so called Justices well know that the economy is falling a part at an increasing rate; and they well know as well, that their liberal affirmative action doctrine is a position that the average white person will no longer support - particularly when it is he or she, who is now finding himself, or herself, out of a job in order that some black can soak up his or her pay check under this court&rsquo;s past rubric of being politically correct at all costs! At all costs? We are about see what &#8220;at all costs&#8221; mean!    </p>
<p>Moreover, these lily white Justices, save one, who live their lives in hermetically sealed cocoons, well isolated from the frothy, angry sea of illiterate drug infested blacks that routinely surge though most of Washington D.C., will soon be facing massive riots and burnings themselves. Their precious blacks? How can they turn on their benefactors?  </p>

			<p>This what results from the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; doctrine. If a state action affects one group differently from another, then, the action is defined as discrimination. <br>
Since in the real world, different groups have different capabilities, we are lead to the only solution: quotas disguised one way or another. <br>
As I understand matters, on a higher level of leadership in a fire department, you need to be smart, and have a lot of executive skill, just as in a military organization. Lives are at stake. Yet, we have the possibility of one man: Justice Kennedy, making a decision that could overrule logic itself. We shall see, but it is not very encouraging to think that whichever way this decision comes out, it will most likely be a 5-4 decision.</p>

<p>When is enough going to be enough? Racial preferences in hiring, BILLIONS of dollars in taxpayer money, &#8216;sensitivity training&rsquo;, endless programs. When is the Black community going to be forced to take responsibility for itself? When are Whites going to quit being made to feel guilty and pay for something that happened before we were all born?</p>

			<p>  The sad part of all this, when you award jobs to protected species, you don&rsquo;t give the job to the best qualified. I would want firefighters to be the most qualified regardless of race or gender. Firefighters are the first line of defense against a raging fire that could cost lives. Only the very best should be hired to fill the jobs. This shouldn&rsquo;t be tangled in the web of affirmative action.</p>

What about the rights of the people of New Haven to have the best fire protection possible.  Isn&rsquo;t that what they are paying for?  Why should any group be protected?  We hold our rights as individuals and as such should have to prove discrimination.  With multiculturalism the larger society&rsquo;s interest is lost in the group fighting.  No matter what the decision, for the country this can not end well.</p>

<p>I believe the author is just ill informed, it was the Griggs v. Duke Power Supreme Court case which established this doctrine, holding that requiring High School diplomas can constitute racial discrimination where blacks lack them in comparison to white job seekers.</p>

			<p>    I had the same thing happen some 15 years ago in the blackbelt . Technology as getting our jobs and the company tested us . I was the only one to fail . I had supervisor after supervisor stop by to tell me . I accepted it at first, school was a long time ago, I can&rsquo;t pass the tests like I once could .Then I began to challenge it, &#8220;If I failed then show me.&#8221; &#8221; Well we can&rsquo;t do that.&#8221; To which I would reply, &#8220;Then I do not believe you.&#8221; Finally the personnel manager came by, who was black but a very fair minded person and said, &#8220;All I can tell you is, it is now being contested in the courts.&#8221; How is the average white supposed to compete or even survive ? Separation is the only answer, our own cities, streets, businesses and government . No malice involved, just exercising our right to survive .Isn&rsquo;t Connecticut about 95% white ? Would&rsquo;ve never dreamed I would see such reverse discrimination there .  </p>

			<p>I was horrified to read the NYT&rsquo;s account if this case day before yesterday in their &#8220;National&#8221; section (by Adam Liptak) : how shackled the hands are of our MSM professional indoctrinators. </p>
<p>Not once in the whole article, was even the vaguest mention of the notion of merit or (God forbid) IQ  even alluded to. </p>
<p>Blacks score poorly on IQ tests, of any type, everywhere in the world, over and over and over since IQ tests were invented, everybody knows this, and yet for the wishful thinking social meddlers of New York&rsquo;s most liberal newspaper, the mere concept of equating testing outcome with group ability is taboo.</p>

<p>Quit true, they want Blacks to be able to sue, but not Whites.<br>
&#8220;The white and Hispanic firefighters are suing &hellip;.&#8221; Since the Hispanic passed the test, they are no longer considered minorities. If they had failed the test, then they would have been considered minorities, along with the Blacks. </p>
<p>I would bet that if some Caribbean Blacks had taken and passed the test, then the liberals would have found a way to lump them in with the White and Hispanic firefighters. </p>

			<p>The term &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; is the biggest problem with the law.The city can set up a perfect test but if no black candidates pass it or score high enough then they can sue under the disparate impact part of the law.It is a cover all.So even where no discrimination is proven they can say, &#8221; Look at the impact of no blacks passing how could this be possible?&#8221;Well it could be possible and the reason could be they didn&rsquo;t study as hard.The reasons are not because of discrimination,but the term &#8220;disparate impact &#8221; can be used when all else fails.</p>

			<p>Everyone knows that if they give the test over the same results will occur.</p>
<p>There is only one solution:</p>
<p>Have the &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; design and administer the test.</p>
<p>It would be hysterical to hear their reaction when whites do better on that test.</p>

<p>I agree with sbuffalonative. This is not some silly case where someone got their feeling hurt, like in the Imus comments. This is a case where peoples lives and property are at risk.</p>
<p>The Justices should be concerned about the safety of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The liberal side of the court should not be able to have their cake and eat it to.&#8221;<br>

<p>Quit true, they want Blacks to be able to sue, but not Whites.<br>
&#8220;The white and Hispanic firefighters are suing &hellip;.&#8221; Since the Hispanic passed the test, they are no longer considered minorities. If they had failed the test, then they would have been considered minorities, along with the Blacks. </p>
<p>I would bet that if some Caribbean Blacks had taken and passed the test, then the liberals would have found a way to lump them in with the White and Hispanic firefighters. </p>

Even if New Haven loses and the whites win, the decision will not be enforced.  The city will just drop the written exam and rely solely on the interview.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I believe the author is just ill informed, it was the Griggs v. Duke Power Supreme Court case which established this doctrine, holding that requiring High School diplomas can constitute racial discrimination where blacks lack them in comparison to white job seekers.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co." rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co.</a></p>
<p>I think wikipedia is wrong as it so often is.  I sat down at the federal courthouse computer and read both Griggs and Kaiser vs Weber.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that Kaiser Steel vs Weber decreed that requiring a steel mill foreman to have a high school diploma and pass a simple reading and writing test was discriminatory against blacks.</p>
<p>Duke Power discriminated against blacks by requiring a certificate of completion of 6th grade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go downtown and read through those cases again, but I am pretty sure Wikipedia has it wrong.  Kaiser vs Weber was the high school diploma case, Griggs was the 6th grade case.</p>

			<p>Even if Native Born White Americans get a civils rights ruling in their favor here and there..over the long term-the long term isn&rsquo;t that long term anymore..it is right around the corner in 2011 when the Census Bureau makes the big announcement-Native Born White Americans are going to lose. If and when Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority in America, they will be subject to ruthless racial discrimination at the hands of post-1965 asians,muslims,carribenas and africans because&hellip;..THEY WILL HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT!!! The US military will have a majority non-white racial compostion and the police will have a non-white racial composition&hellip;mostly hispanic.  The judges of course will be racial supremacist Brahman hindu &#8220;American&#8221; princessess and princes. The federal prosecutors will be chinese and korean &#8220;american&#8221;. Post-1965 non-whites will have the power to force vicious racial discrimination on the Native Born White minority.</p>
<p>The discussion in this thread is very similar to the discussion about bilingualism. When the racial compostion of America changes, you can yap and yap all you want like you want about the legality of bilingualism..all for naught&hellip;Spanish will be impsed upon US.  Same thing with the legality of discrimination against Native Born White American&hellip;it will happen and there will be nothing you can do about it. Racial Demographics is destiny and policy.</p>
<p>It is infantile to believe that racial minority status for Native Born White Americans will mean the end of affirmative action. If you have bothered to pay attention, Barack Obama,the antiwhite Kenyan bigot, has announced on several occasions that there will be more of it. </p>

			<p>The diversity gestapo always tries to say that standardized tests, after all, don&rsquo;t have anything to do with performing a particular job.  They argue that multiple-choice and written exams impact blacks adversely because those tests measure something that ought not be measured in the context of the actual duties.  I say they are wrong.  </p>
<p>In this case they will say that the ability to fight fires and save people and so on has little to do with the intellect. </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s remember that the case above, as in many cases such as this one, involves a test for promotion to supervisory/upper management positions.  Such management duties require the ability and skill to read and communicate effectively in writing, to perform tasks of the intellect and administrative personnel functions, to make personnel decisions related to law, economics, scheduling, leave policies, sexual harassment, procurement, and so on that in fact have little or nothing at all to do with fighting fires, doing CPR, etc.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve simply got to gain a significant foothold in the mainstream media in order to begin to reverse the massive anti-white brainwashing of the last several decades.   </p>
