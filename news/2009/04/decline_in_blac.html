<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0414/p02s01-usgn.html">Decline in Blacks in Prison for Drug Crimes Reverses 25-Year Trend</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Marks, Christian Science Monitor, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time in a quarter century, the number of African-Americans incarcerated for drug offenses in state prisons has declined more than 20 percent while the number of white imprisoned drug offenders has increased more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>The decline took place over a six year period from 1999 to 2005 and reflects fundamental changes in the so-called &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;  &mdash;  how it&rsquo;s targeted and prosecuted  &mdash;  as well as the waning of the crack epidemic in predominantly minority urban areas and the increase in methamphetamine abuse in largely white rural neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The trends were identified in an analysis of Justice Department statistics released Tuesday by The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice and reform nonprofit in Washington, D.C. The study found that an increase in the number of drug courts and state-level efforts to find alternatives to incarceration may have played a role in bringing about the change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the study, the number of blacks in state prisons on drug-related charges dropped from 144,700 in 1999 to 113,500 in 2005. The number of white drug-offenders in prison increased during the same time from 50,700 to 72,300.</p>
<p><b>Perceptions of racial bias</b></p>
<p>When the government ramped up the war on drugs in the 1980s, violent open-air crack markets plagued many urban areas. These areas became the focus of police drug enforcement efforts and crack use invited harsh mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
<p>That led to an exponential increase in the number of imprisoned drug offenders from 40,000 in 1980 to more than 500,000 today, according to Justice Department statistics.</p>
<p>The majority of incarcerated drug offenders have been African-American  &mdash;  despite the fact that drug abuse rates are fairly equal across ethnic and racial lines  &mdash;  and that fed a widespread perception that law enforcement efforts were racially biased.</p>
<p>One impact of the new report, say criminologists, could be that law enforcement will no longer be perceived as biased.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, the disproportionately large percentage of imprisoned African-American drug offenders fueled calls for reform of local police departments as well as the national criminal sentencing structure. Professor Caulkins [Jonathan Caulkins, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh] doesn&rsquo;t want to diminish the presence of racial bias, which he says still exists to some extent in most American institutions, but he contends that incarceration disparities may have had more to do with the nature of the drug epidemic than with overt bias.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, for instance, many urban neighborhoods plagued by the crack epidemic became openly violent. So that&rsquo;s where police targeted their efforts, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crack dealers who once operated openly on urban street corners have now largely disappeared behind closed doors and disposable cellphone numbers, making them harder for police to track, according to The Sentencing Project report.</p>
<p><b>Criminal justice reforms a factor?</b></p>
<p>Other criminologists still see clear racial bias in the way the justice system prosecutes the war on drugs. Apart from the disproportionate incarceration rates, they point to differences in sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine compared with powder cocaine. The two are chemically identical, but the penalties for crack  &mdash;  predominantly used by minorities  &mdash;  remain much harsher than for powder cocaine, which is predominantly used by whites.</p>
<p>The disparity, though, has been reduced in recent years.</p>
<p>That and other reforms of the criminal justice system, such as the development of drug courts in the 1990s which offered treatment in lieu of prison, are also contributing to the decline in the number of African-Americans imprisoned for drug offenses. Mr. Mauer [Marc Mauer] of The Sentencing Project says that&rsquo;s probably because the majority of the more than 2,000 drug courts are located in urban areas.</p>
<p>New York State, which implemented a series of alternatives to incarceration such as drug courts, is a good example of how such policy changes helped lower incarceration rates. In 1999, New York state prisons held about 22,000 people in prison for drug offenses, according to Mauer. By 2005, that had dropped about a third to 14,000.</p>
<p>The state also shows a rise in the number of whites incarcerated for drug offences. In January 2001, whites accounted for 5.4 percent of drug offenders in the New York state prisons. In 2009, that figure had almost doubled to about 10 percent, according to the Correctional Association of New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s led some analysts to argue that the racial shift in national incarceration rates does not reflect changing police and prosecution practices within states so much as the increase in methamphetamine use in many Western and Midwestern states.</p>

			<p>I think the article mentions the reason   &mdash;   that black dealers are getting better at concealing their work, and therefore getting away with it.</p>
<p>There is a bit of legerdemain in this article, that&rsquo;s crucial to the whole point.  It is the phrase &#8220;drug offense.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As you know, not all drug offenses are the same.  Transporting mass quantities of crack cocaine is a drug offense, while possessing a little bit of weed is also a drug offense.  Blacks are disproportionately imprisoned for &#8220;drug offenses&#8221; because they gravitate toward the more serious kinds of &#8220;drug offenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, many whites tend to live in jurisdictions with &#8220;hanging judges,&#8221; that will order prison time for a drug offense (usually possession) that won&rsquo;t get you prison time in the black/liberal cities.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s always excluded from this narrative is that it was black communities that wanted these drug predators removed from their neighborhoods. They are the ones who demanded law enforcement do something.</p>
<p>Now they complain that too many black men are in jail. The problem is not that there are too many black men in jail. The problem is that not enough black men are in jail.</p>
<p>Every drug predator has to be removed from black communities before there will be any improvement. Even then, I suspected the improvement would be small.<br>

<p>Oh, maybe this or that soon to be unemployed City Counsel member called for the police. And I&rsquo;m sure people in the community did that demand something be done. But demand &#8216;drug predators&rsquo; be removed from the neighborhood, and demanding law enforcement officials take a more active role and do something? What fantasy land do you inhabit?</p>

			<p>As Question Diversity noted, the media loves to claim that the higher incarceration rates of blacks over whites for &#8220;drug offenses&#8221; must be racist since the races allegedly have equal rates of illegal drug use.</p>
<p>However, most people in jail on drug charges are not drug users/addicts but drug dealers and gangbangers who are indeed more likely to be black or hispanic than white.  </p>

			<p>How many of the white numbers are actually hispanic? anything to make the blacks look better, right? Never mind the exorbinant numbers PRIOR to the decline. Anything that goes that high up must come down a bit at some time. Also, how many of these numbers are actual serious offenses involving murder for drugs that are cleverly concealed as &#8220;drug crimes&#8221;? Just a thought&hellip;</p>

<p>I think you mean prison.  Prisons are typically for inmates serving a sentence longer than one year  &mdash;  and yes, it&rsquo;s a myth that many of them are imprisoned for personal drug-use.  They are imprisoned for dealing, violence, and related offenses, not minor possession, for which they are at most likely to spend a short time in the county jail. <br>

			<p>Whites are fully capable of selling and buying drugs.  I went to a 95% + white highschool, and there was a sizable group of people involved in the drug trade, several of whom were later prosecuted and given heavy sentences.  But I question how much white meth dealing has really changed the prison dynamic.  Like jenbelievesinwhites mentioned above, how do hispanics affect these numbers?  If we classify hispanics as &#8220;white,&#8221; as I believe they are in some jurisdictions, than I&rsquo;ll wager they make up a large share of that 40% increase among &#8220;whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how often over the next few decades we&rsquo;ll get fed misleading stastics on the declining black share of violent crime, and the corresponding increase in violent crime among &#8220;whites.&#8221;  Articles like this one do us all a disservice by failing to account for the burgeoning U.S. hispanic population, and its affect on the crime stastics.  Let&rsquo;s see some year by year raw number comparisons, let&rsquo;s get a complete picture of what&rsquo;s going on rather than lazily and irresponsibly attributing midwestern meth enforcement when no one knows whether it accounts for more than a small percentage of the shift.</p>

			<p>Its a common trick used in crime statistics for a Hispanic victim to be recorded as Hispanic, but Hispanic perps are invariably reported as &#8220;white&#8221;.  This is very advantagious to the lib-mins, as it decreases the number of white crime victims, while at the same time increasing the number of white perps.  This chicanery would explain the sudden increase in the number of &#8220;whites&#8221; incarcerated for drug offenses.  As for the decrease in black numbers, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that the word went out to stop arresting so many blacks.  After all, most big city police chiefs are blacks, or if not, toady to the blacks.</p>

<p>Funny you mention meth, because after states passed meth laws to limit the acquisition of cold pills, this effectively ended the white trailer park meth labs.  But that didn&rsquo;t eliminate the meth addicts.  And who filled the void?  Right, the Mexican gangs and their far more virulent variety of meth called &#8220;ice.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s happening in certain parts of Missouri.</p>

			<p>Well, I can offer just one small &#8216;truth nugget&rsquo; that might give a clue as to why fewer blacks are being sent to prison for drug offenses.  Jackson, Mississippi has a black mayor.  It has been rumored for many years that Mayor Melton is Jackson&rsquo;s uber-drug-lord.  Those are only rumors; but if my memory serves me correctly, there have been no convictions for drug sales/trafficking in Jackson since he was elected mayor.  Trafficking/sales is what gets you prison time.</p>
<p>My guess is that a huge percentage of black drug dealers live in cities like Jackson, where they are shielded from arrest by black mayors.  Whites, as another poster has noted, have moved to places where law enforcement and the Judiciary are desperate to keep drug crime down, and hand out harsh sentences whenever possible.  Besides: it&rsquo;s a lot easier, safer, and more pleasant to go into a white neighborhood to bust white perps, than to go into a Pit-Bull infested ghetto and try to bust big, strong, ultra-violent blacks.</p>
<p>Add to that, the unspoken initiative to convict more whites (to correct the &#8216;imbalance&rsquo;), and the neat trick of counting Hispanic perps as whites, and I think this explains the upsurge in white imprisonment.</p>
