<h1>Illegal Obama Vote Cast as Wife&rsquo;s Last Wish</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Wisconsin man has acknowledged that he illegally cast an absentee ballot for Barack Obama in his wife&rsquo;s name to fulfill her dying wish.</p>
<p>Stephen Wroblewski (roe-BLESS-key) of Milwaukee said Wednesday he plans to plead guilty to voter fraud to end the embarrassing episode.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His wife, Jacqueline Wroblewski, was a veteran Democratic activist who died of lung cancer in August.</p>

			<p>This is the kind of voter fraud they prosecute, when it comes to a husband voting for his wife or vice versa, and it&rsquo;s a white person.  When it comes to the untold hundreds and thousands of votes that are wrongly cast by black political machines, or three million illegal aliens voting in a Presidential election, there is no prosecutions there.  Might make a minority upset.</p>

			<p>Someone actually got prosecuted for voter fraud?</p>
<p>At this point voter fraud here in the Philly area is so rampant that many of the votes cast in some of the black city precincts are from people who&rsquo;ve ostensibly celebrated their 150th birthday.</p>

			<p>This grieving husband is a sure candidate for a TIME cover extolling the honesty of liberals.  Problem is, is he&rsquo;s never going to get on.  You see, all TIME covers are promised to the Americali chieftan, &#8220;Snoop Dawg&#8221; and all permutations and combinations of the family tribal unit.  I understand that there&rsquo;s even one planned of &#8220;Snoop&#8221; in his drawers, in response to TIME&rsquo;s elite readership &#8220;urining&#8221; for an answer to the question, &#8220;boxers or brfiefs?&#8221;&hellip;..</p>

			<p>Voter fraud is wrong  &mdash;  however, why is this WHITE person being prosecuted while the acorn orgnizations get rewarded for doing the same thing.<br>
I would like to suggest that those of us who want to &#8220;take our country back&#8221; practice a little &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221; of our own.<br>
When the acorn census taker comes to the door or you receive your census forms to fill out  &mdash;  LIE.  You should have AT LEAST 6 people in your &#8220;household&#8221;.  This applies to all those who live in the underrepresented middle of the country who &#8220;cling to God, guns and religion&#8221;.  Don&rsquo;t worry about prosecution; it is possible to have as many individuals as you want residing in your &#8220;household&#8221; EVEN FOR ONE DAY.  <br>
Since obama&rsquo;s minions (acorn and others) skewed the election, it is time for ALL patriots th skew the census.  Let&rsquo;s increase OUR demographics.<br>
Any takers??</p>

			<p>A very emotional article.</p>
<p>I guess it would be equally OK if parents voted for McCain on behalf of their children, simply because they are not old enough yet to vote in Federal elections. If that is actually their wish, to vote for McCain, why should they be denied simply because their birthday missed the election by a few months (or a few years)?</p>
<p>Very likely, Mr. Obama will soon make the argument that the voting age should be lowered to 16 years of age&hellip;..AND those really OLD people should not decide elections for a variety of good reasons, so they should not vote over the age of 70.</p>

			<p>This guy should have just contacted ACORN. They would have gotten a bag lady to vote under his wife&rsquo;s name in exchange for a pack of cigarettes. </p>
