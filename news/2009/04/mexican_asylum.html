<h1>Mexican Asylum Seekers on Rise in Vancouver</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darah Hansen, Vancouver Sun, March 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Professionals on the run from Mexico&rsquo;s brutal drug wars are beginning to appear in Vancouver in search of a safe haven.</p>
<p>This new class of would-be refugee includes lawyers, doctors, police officers and businessmen who say they are being chased out of their country by warring drug cartels whose members have resorted to torture, execution, dismemberment and decapitation to warn their enemies.</p>
<p>An estimated 1,100 people have died in the heated conflict already this year, following 5,300 deaths recorded last year.</p>
<p>As fears mount, record numbers of Mexican nationals are fleeing over the border into the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, the number of asylum requests filed at U.S. border entries by Mexican nationals nearly doubled in the last fiscal year, and the pace continues to increase. In Canada, 8,069 Mexican nationals requested refugee status last year, up from 7,028 in the previous year, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.</p>
<p>Statistics provided by the Canadian Border Services Agency to a French-language newspaper, meanwhile, put the 2008 number higher at 9,456  &mdash;  a figure representing nearly one-quarter of all asylum requests made that year.</p>
<p>The sudden spike in refugee applications from Mexico is a direct consequence of the drug wars between cartels, as the Mexican government tries to break up crime rings, CBSA documents provided to La Presse state.</p>
<p>Vancouver, like the rest of the country, has seen a steady rise in the number of asylum-seekers arriving from Mexico over the past few years. Refugee-assistance agencies say they now are seeing more professionals, including doctors, nurses and lawyers, coming through their doors looking for help.</p>
<p>All of them have terrifying stories about the drug wars back home, said Mario Ayala of the Inland Refugee Society.</p>
<p>Some health professionals have told him they became targets for violence after a gang member in their care died, Ayala said.</p>
<p>Others said their lives were put in danger after cartel members identified them as wealthy and began demanding cash in return for their safety.</p>
<p>Until last year, Ayala said it was &#8220;quite unusual&#8221; to see Mexican professionals among those seeking asylum in Canada. Typically, individuals in this particular economic category would seek entry as business investors, family-sponsored immigrants or as students, he said.</p>
<p>It remains unclear how many asylum requests based on fear of drug violence will be approved. Refugee claims in Canada can take 17 months or longer to work their way through the system, according to Ayala. To date, only about 10 per cent of all refugee claims from Mexico have been accepted. The vast majority of asylum seekers are returned home.</p>
<p>Successful applicants will be required to prove that, because of their profession, they are being persecuted by the drug gangs and that their own government is either unable or unwilling to protect them.</p>
<p>Mexico has been the No. 1 source country for refugee claimants in Canada since 2005. Mexican nationals do not require a visa to enter the country.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s drug violence made headlines in B.C. earlier this month after Attorney-General Wally Oppal met with his counterpart from the Mexican state of Baja California, Rommel Moreno Manjarrez. The pair agreed to share more information about multinational organized crime groups smuggling drugs across the borders.</p>
<p>Moreno Manjarrez told reporters at the time his country is &#8220;at war&#8221; with drug cartels, whose murder victims have included judges, prosecutors, police officers and lawyers.</p>
<p>He said the agreement with B.C. was &#8220;a very important step in the new way to confront organized crime that operates beyond traditional boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>In B.C., gang violence has escalated in recent months, though it remains well below Mexico&rsquo;s levels. Most of it is linked to the lucrative drug trade and disputes over turf and product. B.C. gangsters have been using Mexico as a place to vacation and meet. Two members of a notorious B.C. gang  &mdash;  the United Nations  &mdash;  were gunned down in Mexico last summer.<br>

			<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Mexican drug dealers are invading Vancouver to take over the lucrative drug trade from the Asians.  They also want to be closer to their marijuana plantations in American national forests and gain control of one of the Pacific&rsquo;s most important international ports.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Professionals on the run from Mexico&rsquo;s brutal drug wars are beginning to appear in Vancouver in search of a safe haven.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is these select individuals who will be competition in that country for the other gang lords who control Mexico and have moved up into the US.</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation of arms from the US to Mexico, it is all over the news today that the 90% figure of Mexican guns in Mexico that was claimed to have originated in the US has been proven false.  The real figure is 17%&hellip;&hellip;at most.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in at least three other responses to stories on the subject, it was learned that MOST of the guns in the hands of the cartels are coming directly from the Mexican army from the 100,000 plus deserters who sell their weapons upon leaving the service, many of them employed by the cartels.  </p>
<p>Other sources are Central America.</p>
<p>And, one other note I raised repreatedly, the news emphasized most of the weapons are FULLY AUTOMATIC which can&rsquo;t be purchased in the US anywhere.</p>
<p>I would urge everybody here to never accept what this administration or the MSM tells us is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that some white people can be so gullible.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute that these &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; are innocent, I agree with Margaret, they&rsquo;re drug dealers trying to take over the drug trade inVancouver. And let&rsquo;s just say for the sake of argument that they are fleeing for their lives&hellip; they&rsquo;re probably drug dealers fleeing a rival drug gang.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad Mexico&rsquo;s lies finally had the light of truth shone on them.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a young, newlywed American couple on their honeymoon in Acapulco, were murdered by Mexican bandits in their hotel room. The Mexican federales claimed the husband killed his wife and then committed suicide.</p>
<p>The families of the couple refused to accept this explanation, so the federales went through the motions of conducting an investigation. Not sure how it turned out, but the federales stuck to their story.</p>
<p>The Mexican federales didn&rsquo;t want to wreck Acapulco&rsquo;s reputation as a tourist spot, so they deliberately whitewashed the crime problems in Acapulco.</p>
<p>Why should the lying federales be believed now? </p>

			<p>Hillary&rsquo;s claims are despicable lies.  The practice of telling blatant lies in order to alter some policy or undermine something that benefits white citizens comes right along with these evil Clintons wherever they go.  The Obamanation administration is pefect for them, because they&rsquo;re all just as corrupt.</p>
<p>This evil woman went to Mexico alleging their drug and gang problem are our fault, and, eager to be victims, the corrupt Mexes were absolutely gleeful to be thought of as victims.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story here.  I seriously doubt that even 17% of arms into Mexico come from the US, because arms are so plentiful everywhere in Central and South America.  Disgusting.</p>

			<p>Act quickly, Vancouver. Get rid of them. They tend to multiply and soon your city will look like any border town in Mexico with all the sights and smells. Just check out any place they&rsquo;ve invaded in the US. Their sense of entitlement is outrageous, fueled by the do-nothings in Washington looking for votes or their thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p>They are arriving in increasingly large numbers here, I have stated before that I hear Spanish on a daily basis now (usually LOUD, they have no concept of discretion it seems).</p>

Good point! BC has the largest population of orientals outside of the Orient.  (I&rsquo;m sure calling them Orientals is unPC, but I&rsquo;m not sure what the heck they are calling themselves these days)  Anyway, they have a fight on their hands. Mexicans vs the Chinese&hellip;who will come out on top? Either way, we can we sure it ain&rsquo;t us whites.<br>
