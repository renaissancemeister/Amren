			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>SR International-Radio Sweden (Stockholm), March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In other political news in this Nordic nation, the leader of the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats party hoping to win parliamentary seats in the next election is dismissing Swedish Radio News reports of racist comments in the party&rsquo;s closed-door discussions and refuses to make any apologies.</p>
<p>With its roots in the right-wing, anti-immigrant movement here, the party now insists that it is just like all other democratic parties and does not tolerate racist statements  &mdash;  either in public or in internal discussions. </p>
<p>However, Swedish Radio News sent in 3 journalists with hidden microphones to a number of party meetings in major cities  &mdash;  including with those with official positions and candidates for European Parliament elections in June.</p>
<p>Played on both public service radio and television here, the recordings reveal strong condemnation of refugees and immigrants  &mdash;  calling them violence-prone, criminals, diseased, parasites who don&rsquo;t want to work or integrate into Swedish society and unwelcome into a Swedish home.</p>
<p>The party has made large gains in the last local elections, and tangent the 4% voter support level in the polls necessary to win a seat in parliament.</p>
<p>However, observers predict that this new debate on racism may please those already supporting the party  &mdash;  but could scare off potential new-comers dissatisfied with the established parties.<br>

			<p>The &#8216;no apology&rsquo; should attract more people than it turns off.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;calling them violence-prone, criminals, diseased, parasites who don&rsquo;t want to work or integrate into Swedish society and unwelcome into a Swedish home.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are factual observations. Let the left disprove them instead of merely brandishing their most cliched McCarthyite epithet.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve read these &#8220;racist&#8221; statements over and over again and I fail to see any of them as untrue and that can&rsquo;t be backed up with facts. The same can also be said about our &#8220;immigrants&#8221;.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;the left will always find something wrong with you&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever watched The Daily Show or the Colbert Report on cable, you&rsquo;re well aware that the left is busy recording and TIVOing everything a conservative says to cherry pick one sentence, one word, to tar them with.</p>
<p>The other day, The Daily Show amazingly found a clip of Glenn Beck talking about 9/11 fatigue from hearing from the victims families.</p>
<p>I expect him to be hounded with that single utterance for as long as he&rsquo;s a public figure and beyond.</p>

			<p>Backing down and apologizing got the Protestant nations into the mess we&rsquo;re in. Sweden should have threatened to leave the European Union when EU rules didn&rsquo;t allow them to &#8216;interfere&rsquo; and save their auto industry (GM got Saab, and Ford ate Volvo).  The Swedish people should have raised holy hell the first sign that immigration was becoming a trend.  But no: everybody wanted to be nice, to please the church, to court world opinion, to respect those in authority.  Look where that got them.</p>
<p>Where will being nasty and making outlandish right wing statements get you?  Well, look at Ann Coulter and The delightful crew from Westboro Baptist Church.  Last I heard, these people were all thriving.  And come to think of it, the religions that spread the fastest are the ones being the most pushy and making the most vile statements (while persuing and persecuting anyone who dares cross them).  I&rsquo;m not saying any of this is right.  But it seems to be what works.  </p>
<p>So, definitely, the &#8216;Sweden Democrats&rsquo; should not back down.  And the rest of the country needs to back them up, before it&rsquo;s too late.  I think they and we need to all watch THE MOON IS DOWN, learn what a Resistance Movement really is, then drive out the invaders and the politicians who invited them.</p>

			<p>For anyone familiar with what&rsquo;s been going on in Sweden, I pity those that speak the truth about the immigrants. Prison sentences are routinely handed out for the most innocent of suggestions that the country rethink it&rsquo;s immigration policy. </p>
<p>We are next. Nothing will stop it. Quit fantisizing of some massive &#8220;white awakening&#8221;. Our future will mirror that of Brazil, Mexico and India. 97% poverty with a few percent of disinterested elites.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Racism revealed, no apology&#8221;</p>
<p>The headline calls attention to the lack of public remorse. According the the contemporary script, the heretic &#8216;racists&rsquo; are supposed to immediately recant and wear their shame upon being &#8216;revealed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Something is changing in the political climate in Sweden.</p>

<p>Well&hellip;when the man&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s right!<br>
But it wouldn&rsquo;t occur to any of these clowns that the man may be right. But, where&rsquo;s the &#8216;racism&rsquo; here - no actual racial group was targeted. It&rsquo;s hard enough to deal with &#8216;riff-raff&rsquo; of your own - why import more?</p>
