<h1>Bakersfield Police: Attacker Threatened Baby During Rosedale Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KGET-TV (Bakersfield, California), March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman kidnapped from the parking lot of the Babies &#8220;R&#8221; Us on Rosedale Highway and then robbed and raped told her attacker she learned not to hold onto hatred because she was molested as a child.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The woman had just left the Babies R Us store on when she noticed a man in a tattered military coat lurking in the parking lot, she told police. The woman told detectives she was worried because the man looked like a thug, but she didn&rsquo;t want to seem racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The suspect stated, &#8216;All I want is money. You will be fine. You don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to your baby. Just listen to me,&#8221;&rsquo; the investigating detective wrote in his reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she walked around her vehicle and opened the driver&rsquo;s side door. She pushed the seat forward and the suspect got into the vehicle and sat behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. The victim asked the suspect where they were going and he stated, &#8216;The closest bank that&rsquo;s yours. If I see the cops, your baby&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman told detectives she was worried because the man looked like a thug, but she didn&rsquo;t want to seem racist.&#8221; She said he had an odor of alcohol on his breath, and the subject stated, &#8216;Don&rsquo;t freak out,&rsquo;&#8221; the police report indicates.</p>
<p>The woman offered to give the man several hundred dollars she had in her car, and drove him to the bank to withdraw another $500. The man then demanded she drive to Fruitvale Junior High, where he raped the woman at gunpoint in front of her daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;A car pulled up three spaces north of her vehicle and two women got out of the vehicle. She stated the suspect promised her that he would let her go soon. He stated, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a matter of time&#8221; and began babbling about the time,&#8221; the police report said.</p>
<p>The suspect reportedly took her ID and stated he knew where she lived.</p>
<p>Then, the victim says there was a change in the suspect&rsquo;s demeanor and he acted like he was asking her for a date, reports said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once outside of the car, the victim said the suspect wanted a kiss, stating, &#8220;This time like you mean it. I want a real one.&#8221;</p>
<p>She advised she kissed him and got back in her vehicle. The victim said the suspect walked behind her vehicle to the right side of it. She sat in her vehicle for a minute, then started her vehicle, backed out of the parking stall and left. The victim said she looked back and saw the suspect who had a smirk on his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakersfield Police booked Anthony Ray Graham, Jr. for the kidnap and rape about a month later. Graham has pleaded not guilty and has declined requests for a jailhouse interview.</p>
<p>Criminalists with the Kern County Crime Lab said they matched DNA from saliva on the victim&rsquo;s breast to Graham&rsquo;s DNA that had been entered into a criminal database following his arrest and conviction on a battery charge.</p>
<p>The victim also positively identified Graham in a photo lineup, reports indicate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Graham replied, &#8216;Well my DNA was in that vehicle because I sneezed and that&rsquo;s why you have my DNA. He stated he sneezed while he was in the back seat. Graham continued to deny (his involvement) for approximately half an hour to 45 minutes. he then stated, &#8216;Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened. Yes, I did kiss her breast, but she allowed me to.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Seems like someone just watched the film &#8216;Obsessed,&rsquo; and had a high level of testosterone and an IQ of 85.</p>
<p>Hollywood and multiculturalism raped this woman.</p>

			<p>Black men also rape black women, and in greater numbers than white woman. If they cause so much damage and harm to their own women what makes people think white women are so special.  Black women are in contact with black men more than any other group and have a higher chance of rape than white women. Men aren&rsquo;t attacking these women because they are white, they are attacked because they are more naive, weak,and gullible. A predator always goes for the easiest prey. Women have to be guarded especially when alone. When this woman saw a suspicious looking man by her car she should have immediately called security and not proceeded to the car. I don&rsquo;t care if a man has on a suit and tie and a Rembrant smile,  I&rsquo;m not going near my car if he is acting sinisterly. I live in an affluent black area not to far from an impoverished one. The criminals can easily reach my neighborhood. <br>
Although men rape for power and control(black rapes black), I think many black men rape white women specifically because the schools teach white men did it to black women for hundreds of years. I think it some sort of revenge thing. Its taught to them before they graduate elementary school so they stay in school long enough to learn that part.</p>

<p>Yes, this victim was trained well by the media and by the education system.  We are all trained to believe that the worst thing that a White person can be is &#8220;racist.&#8221;  To be racist is much worse than being raped or being killed.  </p>
<p>Women: Wake up!  Not only is it correct to be racist, but your survival requires that you never, NEVER trust an African.  Never allow yourself to be susceptible.  It is your duty to turn around and walk or run, when approached by an African. Let them find a different victim. </p>
<p>Men: It is your duty to inform your wives, sisters, and daughters.  Government and media propaganda are working against you.  Your children may have already been brainwashed, so you may have to start gently, by simply making comments about pictures and articles in the newspaper, such as &#8220;Honey, have you ever seen this person?&#8221;  Any newspaper on any day should have a story about an African who committed a crime.  Slowly build from there.  Do not leave your daughters defenseless. </p>
<p>Finally, get rid of your TV   &mdash;   it is a one-eyed Bolshevik!  It is a giant &#8220;propaganda machine&#8221; feeding your children lies.  If necessary, rent approved movies, but don&rsquo;t let your kids watch TV.</p>

			<p>This is the first thing that women need to learn in self defense classes: DO NOT be afraid to ask for an escort to your vehicle or to avoid a black man because you are afraid of seeming &#8220;racist&#8221; If you get that little feeling that something is not right then something is NOT right. A good book to read on the subject is Gavin DeBecker&rsquo;s &#8220;The Gift of Fear&#8221;. He details how women are afraid of seeming either unfriendly or racist and end up crime victims.</p>

			<p> This poor brainwashed White fool was threatened, raped and robbed because she &#8220;didn&rsquo;t want to appear racist.&#8221; She didn&rsquo;t want to consider him a thug because she &#8220;didn&rsquo;t want to appear racist,&#8221; despite the fact that he had alcohol on his breath and a gun in his hand.</p>
<p> And look at his photo: The same dead, no-conscience eyes as most of the black hoodlums have whose pictures have appeared on this website. No wonder he was smirking as she drove away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then, the victim says there was a change in the suspect&rsquo;s demeanor and he acted like he was asking her for a date, reports said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim said she looked back and saw the suspect who had a smirk on his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>This is the black male mentality that is reinforced over and over through media portrayals of interracial pairings of black male-white female. These low IQ predators already believe that all white females want to have sex with black men. So to them a rape is actually a &#8216;first date.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Guys like this are actually so stupid they think the sexual violence they perpetrate is appreciated by the victim and the victim will be coming back for more voluntarily. There was even a story like this in St. Paul last year where a black man was arrested for rape after he contacted his victim again to try to date her a week or two after the rape.</p>

			<p>I know my husband gets a bit annoyed if a black guy is checking me out.  I do too.</p>
<p>If a black man says &#8220;hi&#8221; or &#8220;good morning&#8221; I just say &#8220;hi&#8221; back and scurry off&hellip;I don&rsquo;t make eye contact or anything.  This is while I&rsquo;m going into a store.  Typically, though, where I shop, there are hardly any blacks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate black people but I do not trust them.  I know of a couple who are fellow Christians, but other than that  &mdash;  I won&rsquo;t associate with them.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a young white female. One night, I was walking to the parking garage after class when I heard a group of black males laughing and shouting behind me. Normally I wait for the elevator, but that night I hightailed it into the garage and ran up four flights of stairs. Maybe they were harmless, maybe not. What I do know is nothing sinister happened to me that night, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to good old &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

These low IQ predators already believe that all white females want to have sex with black men. So to them a rape is actually a &lsquo;first date.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also taught in every school in the country according to feminazi diktats.  Starting in 6th grade, every child is forced to read that disgusting, vicious black on white rape propaganda piece &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the black boys learn that all White women yearn for black men and that all a black rapist has to say is &#8220;she wanted it&#8221; for the charge to be dismissed.</p>
<p>A district attorney told me that almost all rapists he questioned insisted the women wanted sex.</p>
<p>Once when he went to the jail to question a rapist the black moron kept insisting that &#8220;she wanted it, for real, she wanted it.&#8221;  That rapist broke the victim&rsquo;s wrist, jaw and nose.  But according to the &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#8221; theory, black men are angels of chasity innocent of rape.</p>
<p>But the commie feminazis who control the school reading lists insist on shoving this vile, vicious piece of pro rape propaganda &#8220;Mockingbird&#8221; on every school reading list.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of something that happened to me back during the time of segregation in the early 50s in Washington, DC. I am a white woman. I had a second job where I worked till Midnight. Then I&rsquo;d stand at the bus stop after work.  Blacks could only be in the white area of DC after dark if standing at a bus stop waiting to transfer to another bus.  Some black men were there.  A bus stopped and a black lady got off.  With little hesitation she walked over to me and said &#8220;May I stand with you?  We women have to stick together.&#8221; Of course, I acquiesced.  I thought then that she feared the black men whereas I did not, because if a black man had molested me at that time, the police would have dealt with him severely without a lawyer present. But that was probably not the case if they molested her.  Now it seems almost like a dream, that I ever felt safe on the street at night. </p>

Black women are in contact with black men more than any other group and have a higher chance of rape than white women. &#8220;</p>
<p>That is very true.  </p>
<p>I dealt with black rapists as a Probation Officer for many years.  As I have posted before, although the County was only 8 percent black I cannot remember even 1 rapist who was not black.  Probably there were a few non black rapists but I don&rsquo;t remember any.  It is a small county, everybody knows everybody else.  There is only one Probation Office.  It is in the same building as the rape investigators.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t meet many of the rape victims, so I didn&rsquo;t keep track of their race.  I had the impression the blacks raped more black women than White women.</p>
<p>The difference is that whereas White women sympathize with black victims of black rape, most black women hate White women and rejoice when black men rape White women.</p>
<p>Blacks may abuse each other, but they join together to abuse Whites.  Race beats gender every time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes people think white women are so special.&#8221;</p>
<p>We, a very, very few White nationalists are the only people in the country who try to defend White women against black rapists.<br>
White feminists will choose a black rapist over a White rape victim every time and so will every liberal.</p>
<p>I spent my entire adult life working with affirmative action blacks.  I have found black men far better to be around than black women.  Working with black women, even the most educated, is a true horror, a descent into insane chaotic vicious lunacy every day.  </p>
<p>Black men may constitute the majority of violent criminals, but I&rsquo;s much rather work in a black male workplace than a black female work place. I&rsquo;m a woman.  I spent my entire adult life working with blacks.  Black men may be criminals, but black women are just pure evil.</p>

			<p>That article is disturbing beyond just the obvious. If one didn&rsquo;t know better, one might be lead to believe she really wasn&rsquo;t all that put-out by the experience! What a horrifyingly placid reaction to such a violent, malicious act. Her bizarre statements about not &#8220;holding onto hatred&#8221; and so fearing to appear &#8220;racist&#8221; that she didn&rsquo;t trust her own natural instinct is just chilling to me. What a dreadful story&hellip;for so many, many reasons.  </p>

			<p>I had to see the movie &#8220;To kill a mockingbird&#8221; in HS. Thank God, I didn&rsquo;t have to read it.<br>
   I have always thought that the black guy was guilty. I thought the case against him was solid.  I thought that was the point of the movie. At the end, Atticus would have to realize the man truly was guilty, and this would be on his concious. This didn&rsquo;t happen.<br>
   I know everyone deserves a fair trail and defense attorneys must do the best they can for their client, but I always wondered how they deal with the guilt.</p>

<p>I have read &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pro-rape.  Basically the black man, Tom Robinson, was convicted based solely on race.  The white woman, Mayella Ewell, came onto him, and he knew that if he accepted her proposition, he&rsquo;d been in deep trouble.  There&rsquo;s also a hint that Mayella&rsquo;s father sexually abused her.  Tom turned her down, her father came in and saw what was going on and beat her up, and to cover her shame of coming on to a black man, they concocted the rape story.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this was supposed to take place in the mid-1930s, when blacks more or less knew their place  &mdash;  especially in the South.</p>
<p>Now, having said that&hellip;I think that today, most black men would jump at the chance of getting it on with a white woman.  However  &mdash;  I would not automatically assume that it was rape before having heard all the evidence.  Innocent until proven guilty.  Even if you&rsquo;re pretty sure it was rape, there still needs to be a trial, and evidence looked at.</p>

			<p>At least the victim has the satisfaction of knowing that at no time did she appear racist or oppress her attacker, she can sleep at night knowing she is still politically correct. She is an excellent model for all white women </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s almost a repeat of this quote from a previous amren article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Connors speculates that she might have run away in the awkward moments before David Francis attacked her had it not been for the fear that she&rsquo;d appear racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/cqeay8</p>
<p>Now I have TWO amren articles to post on my mainstream site  &mdash;  knoxnews.com  &mdash;  whenever some poster brags on how she&rsquo;s raising her children to not be racist.</p>
<p>(In some situations, I just post the original articles, but when I think I can get away with it, which is usually now, I try to lead readers to amren)</p>

			<p>jesse jackson (yes the poverty pimp and race hustler) once said that if he was walking down the street and heard voices behind him, when he turned around to see who it was, he was relieved to see that they were WHITE.  He would also cross the street if he saw a number of blacks who looked like they were up to no good.<br>
Enough said.</p>

			<p>What whites have to do is create a scene though it goes against their education and upbringing.  After living with blacks for years I finally learned this. </p>
<p>Now when I&rsquo;m confronted, feel unsafe, I&rsquo;m ridiculed   &mdash;  - anything at all, I create a scene.  It worked quite well with two black women a few years ago with THEM backing off.  Blacks expect whites to retreat because we simply want to be left alone but I advance in a sense, showing no fear.  Because I&rsquo;m not afraid, I&rsquo;m disgusted and angry.  </p>
<p>I yell, curse and do those bodily movements like snapping my head and stuff (basically acting like them) and I don&rsquo;t back down.  Believe it or not, they respect someone who stands up to them.  If you try to converse or show calmness they see it as weakness.  Get on their level (which is being beneath yourself) and you&rsquo;ll have their respect plus, they&rsquo;ll back off. I&rsquo;ve also been laughed at several times because they simply cannot believe a white woman is acting like this.   But walk away they do.  </p>
<p>Believe what I say, I&rsquo;m teaching you something here as a resident of the projects for over 10 years and the token white. And don&rsquo;t forget that yelling / talking LOUDLY part. Works like a charm. :D </p>

			<p>I also agree with chocolateshake but I think it&rsquo;s a combination of factors.  Black men lust after white women and they justify their lust and attacks through the history of oppression that is pounded into their heads from an early age.  Add to this the fact that black women, by and large (mostly large) are not as attractive as white women and usually not as well behaved (with exceptions of course).</p>

			<p>&#8220;she was worried because the man looked like a thug, but she didn&rsquo;t want to seem racist&#8221;</p>
<p>How often must we read this sad refrain?</p>
<p>P.S. Is she already condemnable as &#8220;racist&#8221; for thinking he looked like a thug?</p>
<p>P.P.S. To see a face like this rapist&rsquo;s in the Bakersfield area is disturbing enough.</p>

			<p>A perfect opportunity to sue. People just don&rsquo;t override their natural instincts for personal safety in order not to offend an obvious criminal. Find out who in this woman&rsquo;s past psychologically conditioned her to put herself in danger - and sue the pants off them!!! Was it the public schools? The $LPC Teaching Tolerance program? A workplace diversity training firm? It is such as obvious play for lawyers, I might just go to law school myself and make this my life&rsquo;s work. Just think if every victim of black crime sued the $LPC how quickly its asset base would disappear.</p>

			<p>Black guys hang around in parking lots all the time harrassing people.  Some of them talk to every white female that comes out the door.  A friend of mine recommended that you don&rsquo;t say hi or anything, just keep walking.  She said that experience has taught her that this is the best way for her.  Black males don&rsquo;t say hi to white females they don&rsquo;t know in parking lots to be friendly, they want something, usually whatever they can get.  They don&rsquo;t say hi to white males.  Make no mistake, black males target white females for rape.  There is a case in Chicago where a white female was abducted at a bus stop and raped by 35 black males.  Naturally the black male worshipping media didn&rsquo;t report it.  Don&rsquo;t forget about the Melissa McLauchlin case.  Black males specifically went looking for a white female to gang rape and murder, and they found one. </p>

			<p>Thank GOD this woman was successfully able to avoid appearing &#8220;racist&#8221;.  That would have been a far worse fate than being abducted, raped, robbed, and threatened with bodily harm to her infant.</p>
<p>Hollywood and the MSM should be delighted they have established the right set of priorities among young mothers.</p>

			<p>Chocolate Shake: You have courage to say what you did about black on white rapes,if you are in fact black,and I admire you for it.Why do so very few white men rape black women?It isnt because they are not attracted to them.Televisin programming is just one giant anti white propaganda machine that stirs up black hatred of Whitey.</p>

			<p>To chocolateshake:</p>
<p>You may need to revise your statement that black women suffer more frequently at the hands of black men. </p>
<p>Check out the FBI&rsquo;s most recent UCR crime statistics. Within the rape section, pay careful attention to the demographic information on actor versus victim. </p>

			<p>Required reading for all AmReners should be Eldridge Cleaver&rsquo;s book &#8220;Soul On Ice.&#8221; Cleaver was a Black Panther and militant black racist, and the book has a chapter all about lusting after white women and how sex with a white woman is a big symbolic victory, as if it is an act of taking and claiming the white man&rsquo;s most precious property.</p>
<p>Whites really need to get a glimpse into the mind of the average black man, because it would be a real wake up call. You need to really find out what these people think about whites. That&rsquo;s the only way you will know if Thomas Jefferson was right when he said that the two races cannot live under the same government. </p>

<p>Men in general will screw anything  white they are insanely hot and alone regardless of race.  They  won&rsquo;t date the women or introduce them to  family and friends but they will bed them.   Men buy prostitutes all the time. Black men aren&rsquo;t the only men who engage in interracial mating and lust after women  of different  ethnicities (Prince Albert of Monaco, Brad pItt, collins farrell, wolfgang puck etc.) Check out yahoo personals etc. or any big city and you will see this. People lust after people of different ethnicities because its different than what they&rsquo;re use to so it becomes exciting to them, it has nothing to do with whats better or not. Most people are just experimenting especially black men who love to upset white men and are just trying to get a rainbow of notches in their belt. </p>

<p>Was this a predominately white shopping center. I see them doing the same thing at black shopping centers and in black neighborhoods .  They know they have to harass as many women as possible  to get to that one weak gullible one sorta like the men at bars who will try to talk every women into going home with them.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what race of women their pursuing women should avoid their  actions, they obviously have too much time on their hands as a result of not having ambitions and goals, that they can waste time in parking lot.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I had to see the movie &ldquo;To kill a mockingbird&rdquo; in HS. Thank God, I didn&rsquo;t have to read it.<br>
I have always thought that the black guy was guilty. I thought the case against him was solid. I thought that was the point of the movie. At the end, Atticus would have to realize the man truly was guilty, and this would be on his concious. This didn&rsquo;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Let me clear a few things up here.</p>
<p>In the book, Mayella&rsquo;s injuries were to the right side of her face, meaning that her attacker had to have been left-handed.</p>
<p>Tom Robinson, the black man accused of rape, had a deformed left arm from a childhood accident involving a cotton gin  &mdash;  the hand was completely useless.</p>
<p>Mayella&rsquo;s father was ambidextrous, though he primarily used his left hand.  He also abused his children and sexually abused Mayella.</p>
<p>There had been finger marks all around Mayella&rsquo;s throat, indicating someone had tried to choke her.  It was highly unlikely a man with only one good hand could have done that.</p>
<p>That right there should have acquitted Robinson in the book.  Had I been on the jury, I would have said not enough evidence to convict.  Plenty of room for reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>It could be that maybe, just maybe, Robinson had been kind of hoping&hellip;he was doing all those chores for her, he &#8220;felt sorry for her&#8221;&hellip;but he likely knew what would happen if he tried anything.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no big point in defending segregation. Two races cannot share the same living space indefinitely. It just doesn&rsquo;t work out and brings out the worst in people. Violence against either race by the other is bad for everyone. </p>
<p>What whites need is the same thing that blacks need. Living space where they can be themselves without being harassed, judged, ridiculed, belittled, without anger, without self consciousness. Both races need living spaces where they can breathe easy and develop their own potentials. </p>
<p>All the violence and resentment comes from putting cats and dogs together and expecting them to get along indefinitely. What kind of person puts cats and dogs together to watch them fight? An evil person, that&rsquo;s who. </p>
<p>What the liberal liars are doing right now is segregation, where the rich whites live far away from the blacks and move if they have to. The poor whites just have to &#8220;deal&#8221; with the tensions on their own and are maligned by the media any time they stand up for themselves. This doesn&rsquo;t work out in the end. </p>

			<p>Alexandra: To kill a mockingbird is actually a work of fiction, right?</p>
<p>Check out &#8216;A lesson before dying&rsquo; which I had to read in an English lit. class. We also watched the movie so the blacks in the class would understand the story.</p>
<p>The character in this book would have been charged guilty by anyone with logic.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I spent my entire adult life working with affirmative action blacks. I have found black men far better to be around than black women. Working with black women, even the most educated, is a true horror, a descent into insane chaotic vicious lunacy every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too am a white woman who used to have to deal with angry black women when I was younger and single.  Now that I am married to a white man with white kids they treat me nicer.  Although I have never been alone with a black male my experiences with them have always been problem free.  </p>

			<p>Yes, To Kill a Mockingbird is fiction.  The point of the book was, someone was convicted based on race alone, when the evidence pointed to his innocence.</p>
<p>Granted, the scenario, in real life, is highly unlikely.  But not totally impossible.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, a conviction based solely on race is wrong&hellip;you have to look at the evidence.  Equal before the law, everyone gets a fair trial.</p>
<p>One has to wonder why Harper Lee just wrote that one book.  To put blacks in a more favorable light?  While sixty years before that, Upton Sinclair  &mdash;  a Socialist  &mdash;  detailed black people&rsquo;s shenanigans during the Union Stockyards strike of 1904 (remember To Kill a Mockingbird came out in the 60s).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to check out &#8220;A Lesson Before Dying.&#8221;  I never heard of it, so I&rsquo;ll run a Google search on it and check it out, okay?</p>

<p>I have read &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pro-rape. Basically the black man, Tom Robinson, was convicted based solely on race. The white woman, Mayella Ewell, came onto him, and he knew that if he accepted her proposition, he&rsquo;d been in deep trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have read the book also.  The book was written as liberal propaganda that(1) black men are not rapists (2) white women want them.</p>
<p>The book makes it very clear that Saint Thomas the chaste did not rape or even come on to Mayella.  Mayella came on to him.</p>
<p>That is why the book was written.  It is fiction.  The whole thing was written by Truman Capote, not Harper Lee to create a defense of black on white rapists.</p>
<p>That is why I call it pro black on rape propaganda.  I know that the fictional Saint Thomas the chaste did not even come on to Mayella.  </p>
<p>I also know why the book was written and published, to create a &#8216;halo effect&#8221; so ACLU NAACP ADL attorneys could get black rapists of white women off scott free.  This epidemic of black on white rape was and is designed to destroy White males.  If a race of men cannot even defend their women from rape, what are they?  Slaves and subject peoples.</p>
<p>Another pro rape book was written about the same time by communist John Steinbeck, &#8220;Of Mice and Men.&#8221;  In Mice and Men, both victim and rapist murderer were white.  The rapist murderer<br>
was a poor farm laborer.  The woman he murdered and raped was the wife of a well off farmer.  Thus the woman deserved to be raped and die not only because she was well off, but as an insult to her husband the well off farmer.</p>
<p>Of Mice and Men is as much a pro rapist book as is Mockingbird.  Actually, Mice and Men is worse because the white rapist murdered his victim.</p>
<p>And by the way, the Scottsboro boys were guilty as charged and Emmett Till did rape Mrs. B.  His Father raped and murdered an Italian woman during ww2 and was hanged for it.  Apparently the <br>
ACLU NAACP ADL did not have offices in Italy in 1945 so Justice was done.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Now I have TWO amren articles to post on my mainstream sit&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>M. Dumpty:</p>
<p>Make it THREE!:</p>
<p>Here is another excellent article from AmRen about a White woman who didn&rsquo;t want to appear racist and paid for her foolishness with her life:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the luxury building boasts private elevators, around-the-clock security and skyline-view homes that cost as much as $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Just two weeks into retirement, Calle wanted to sell her condo so she could move in with her fiance.</p>
<p>&#8216;Would you like for me to escort him up?&rsquo; the guard asked Calle, according to Meadows.</p>
<p>&#8216;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rsquo; Calle responded. &#8216;I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo; Jamal Thompson, headed up on his own around 2 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>She died from blunt force trauma&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/cyece2</p>
<p>And this, from the thread, another fine comment from margaret:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Because she did not write Mockinbird. Truman Capote wrote it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by margaret at 5:54 PM on May 2</p>
<p>margaret:</p>
<p>Very good posts from you, as always.</p>
<p>You are dead on about  To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men being used as propaganda tools by the government indoctrination system to destroy Western Civilization and make Whites &#8216;Slaves and subject peoples.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I too believe that Mockingbird was written by Capote and not Harper Lee  &mdash;  but I can find no proof of such.</p>
<p>If you have any documentation of this, please post it.</p>

			<p>This &#8220;not wanting to appear racist&#8221; thing has just gone way &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221; if I may.  Hardly anyone knows what that means anymore, but it&rsquo;s a great phrase.  It means, this has just gone way over the line.  And if you give them a millimeter, they&rsquo;ll try to take a kilometer (or sell you a kilo of something).  But here&rsquo;s my take on this horrible situation&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, the woman&rsquo;s first loyalty in the situation was to HER CHILD, not some stranger.  Nobody&rsquo;s getting near my kid if I don&rsquo;t know who they are, no matter what color they are.  </p>
<p>Secondly, why the heck does she care what a stranger thinks about her political correctness or incorrectness?  He&rsquo;s a STRANGER, for Pete&rsquo;s sake.  I generally don&rsquo;t give a hoot what strangers think of me, unless it&rsquo;s someone like a cashier who is providing me with customer service.  And, if it&rsquo;s a bad cashier, I do care that they know I feel &#8220;empowered&#8221; enough not to be pushed around by them.  If it&rsquo;s a good cashier, I try to complement them.  I&rsquo;m really not anti-social, but I&rsquo;m old enough to be tired of social leeches (and criminals!) trying to waste my time/exploit me for whatever they feel they&rsquo;re entitled to get.  Too much of my paycheck is already deducted for people who never intend to get another job due to mental &#8220;disability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if that woman had been with me in the parking lot, I wouldn&rsquo;t have given the man the time of day, and if I had been alone with him in the parking lot, he would have known better than to tangle with me.  There is real truth in &#8220;looking like a victim&#8221;.  And don&rsquo;t forget, and I know this will sound awful, but stranger is just one letter away from strangler.  Don&rsquo;t even let these guys anywhere near you, and especially within arm&rsquo;s length.  There are reasons they look like thugs; they ARE thugs!!</p>
<p>Lastly, if he&rsquo;s loitering in a parking lot, that&rsquo;s probably against the law.  Check your local jurisdiction to see if panhandling is against the law in your area, but if you don&rsquo;t have cops who will go after those people, that&rsquo;s when you definitely have a very, VERY big problem.  </p>

<p>EXACTLY. I don&rsquo;t care whether someone thinks I&rsquo;m &#8220;racist&#8221; or not. If I feel unsafe, I don&rsquo;t go anywhere near them. This goes for men of any race including White men, whom I have also on occasion felt unsafe around. My first priority is to myself and my family.</p>
