			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Black folks, in particular, get irritated,&#8221; says Johnson [Jeff Johnson, a black radio and TV political commentator], who travels the lecture circuit, hosts a half-hour show on Black Entertainment Television and has a weekly spot for social criticism on a radio program popular with black listeners. Get past &#8220;Obama the personality&#8221; and see &#8220;Obama the president,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Otherwise all you&rsquo;re being is a political-celebrity groupie instead of a citizen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It starts with acknowledging he&rsquo;s my president, and not my homie.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson is one of a growing number of black academics, commentators and authors determined to press Obama on issues such as the elimination of racial profiling and the double-digit unemployment rate among blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened to Smiley [Tavis Smiley, a talk show host and author] last year, when he was the one in the commentator&rsquo;s chair that Jeff Johnson now sits in on Tom Joyner&rsquo;s syndicated morning radio program. During the heated Democratic primary, Smiley questioned Obama&rsquo;s decision not to attend his annual State of the Black Union conference and said he hoped Obama would make it through the campaign &#8220;with his soul intact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The push-back was &#8220;brutal,&#8221; Smiley recalls. Angry listeners called him a &#8220;sellout,&#8221; an &#8220;Obama hater&#8221; and &#8220;Uncle Tom.&#8221; Surprised and hurt, Smiley left Joyner&rsquo;s show but now uses the rough patch to make the case for a new book he co-wrote, &#8220;Accountable: Making America as Good as Its Promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book, Smiley&rsquo;s third about issues facing black Americans, has a picture of Obama on the cover and outlines the president&rsquo;s promises during the campaign to elevate the status of his fellow African Americans. Smiley wants readers to use the book as a tool to measure the new administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I&rsquo;m up against,&#8221; he continues, because he is still accused of &#8220;casting aspersion on Barack Obama or having some issue with Barack Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>What he is up against are people like Leutisha Stills, a regular blogger on the African American opinion site Jack and Jill Politics. She dismisses anything Smiley has to say about Obama because he is &#8220;always going negative.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama team has further complicated the critical discussion by deftly managing relationships with the constituencies it ignited during the campaign, providing access and information and defusing complaints before they become public battles. African Americans are one of the groups to whom the team has catered.</p>
<p>The president skipped schmoozing with the Washington press corps at the Gridiron Club last month, but he and the first lady hosted a reception in the State Dining Room for members of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, an organization of black newspapers. The group recently named the Obama family its Newsmaker of the Year.</p>
<p>Obama also called black talk radio host Warren Ballentine&rsquo;s show in late February to push his stimulus package. A couple of weeks later, the president appeared via satellite at Smiley&rsquo;s State of the Black Union  &mdash;  the same conference he skipped last year.</p>
<p>Members of his team have also been working closely with leaders of black civil rights groups, such as Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, who praised Obama for committing more money to job training and summer youth employment programs in the stimulus package.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political blogger Faye Anderson disagrees. &#8220;Black folks don&rsquo;t know what to do with a black president,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We really can&rsquo;t have a double standard.&#8221; She accuses the traditional civil rights groups of &#8220;not doing what they would do if it was someone other than a black man in office.&#8221;</p>
<p>To hold Obama accountable, she created the Tracking Change wiki to follow the stimulus money and document whether a proportionate share reaches the black community.</p>
<p>Glen Ford, who co-edits the left-leaning Black Agenda Report, says the pull to support Obama is powerful for blacks. When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, Ford recalls, editors at the online publication endorsed him even though he was too middle-of-the-road for their tastes. &#8220;We did not want to be perceived as the proverbial crabs in a barrel trying to bring a brother down,&#8221; Ford says.</p>
<p>But as Obama settles into his presidency, Ford says, it would be irresponsible not to look at him critically. He puts it this way: &#8220;We broke out of our cowardice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With the state of the economy, the fact that we&rsquo;re at war on at least two fronts, we&rsquo;re dealing with 50 percent dropout rates for some high school students, we&rsquo;re losing jobs  &mdash;  we don&rsquo;t have time to celebrate nothing,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;Anybody who cares about making history more than they care about the transformation of their community and their country has a real misplaced understanding of what making history is supposed to mean.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The person that I believe we voted for doesn&rsquo;t want us to continue to celebrate him.&#8221;<br>

Just more proof   &mdash;   as if any more were needed at this late date   &mdash;   that no matter how much is given to blacks, even up to the Presidency itself, it will NEVER EVER be enough for them. Their capacities for complaining and feeling slighted are INFINITE. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve given up trying to please them at all. At this point, all I want from blacks is for them to keep away from me. Yes, this includes Obama. </p>

		<p>I hate to tell you all, but Obama is that he is, what he is and where he is precisely because people see the celebrity and not the politician.  You better hope that people do what you ask of them and start trying to look inside the empty suit.</p>

		<p>Maybe if the blacks in this country pulled up their pants, stopped worshiping a thug culture and got an education maybe they&rsquo;d be able to get a job.  In the meantime, there is no way in hell I&rsquo;d hire one of these black thug wannabes to represent my company.</p>

<p>If they&rsquo;re upset now, just wait awhile and they&rsquo;ll see scrutiny and resentment directed at this man like never before.</p>
<p>The country WILL collapse into depression and riots.</p>

		<p>I cant help but think that eventually, blacks are going to realise that obama is not one of them, that he himself is an &#8220;uncle tom&#8221;&hellip; at least by black standards. </p>
<p>Think about it. Hes not going to cow to blacks&rsquo; every demand, because any president, no matter how liberal, even if black, knows better than to do so. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I recently discovered two gangster rappers who are highly critical of Obama: KRS- one, and another rapper whos name I cannot recall, from Public Enemy&hellip; their criticism mostly stems from obamas support for the wars in the middle east and what is known as the &#8220;new world order&#8221;.</p>
<p>in a conspiracy-themed documentary called &#8220;the obama deception&#8221;, you see KRS- one say &#8220;They put a black face on the new world order, and now we all supposed to be happy.. KRS aint buyin it!&#8221;</p>
<p>maybe other gangster rappers can learn from this.</p>

		<p>Blacks are in the tank for Obama and will be no matter what the state of the country is in 2010 or 2012. First and foremost, blackness trumps every other consideration in their &#8220;thinking.&#8221; Secondly, they understand without it being spelled out to them that everything this administration does amounts to &#8220;sticking it to The Man,&#8221; and that is very heaven to them.</p>

		<p>Pres.Obama does have a plan to do something about the double digit unemployment among blacks.  He wants to bring in millions of Asians and Latinos to revitalize our industry and cure cancer.</p>

		<p>This country needs to stop obsessing and being held hostage about black issues.  Money cannot ever change inherent inferior genes.  Selective breeding of all racial groups is needed to eliminate poverty and crime.  Fifty years later after trillions of taxpayer money, the blacks are no better.  Matter of fact, they are worse because of the pampering.  Blacks now need to struggle on their own, based on merit and intelligence like everyone else.  They need to be allowed to find their place in society without taking hand outs or playing on white guilt.  Of course, blacks will never say no to hand outs if it constantly forced on them except for a few. </p>

<p>Even a black conservative by the name of Jesse Lee Peterson said that.  It&rsquo;s like the more you give, the more they complain and want more.  Very similar to dealing with animals, children, and bullies.  </p>

<p>More to the point, he knows he doesn&rsquo;t have too. Blacks will never fail to support him in numbers well above ninety percent, no matter what he does or how it affects them. He says what they want to hear; what he does is irrelevant to them by comparison. He&rsquo;s a Democrat, and of course there is the all-important fact that he looks like them. </p>
<p>In short, he doesn&rsquo;t have to actually do anything to keep them in his pocket. He owns them. They&rsquo;re <i>his</i> and he knows it.</p>

<p>Problem is, whites are the lead in obessing about blacks. The country almost fell apart several times during the 19th century, first the abolition movement, the Kansas Nebraska wars, the Civil War, the destruction of the South that lasted 100 years, the destruction of nearly all our great cities by black immigrants from the south during the 20th century, school busing and the destruction of the school system, affirmative action, crime it goes on and on.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that it is always whites who use the blacks as storm troopers against other whites.</p>

<p>Since AmRen dosn&rsquo;t yet have a thumbs up vote tally,<br>
***THUMBS UP!***</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a black problem so much as we have a clueless whites problem. I&rsquo;m not sure we can turn white masses around either as they are blind and brainless to the obvious truth that exists in EVERY- SINGLE- BLACK- COMMUNITY the world over.</p>
<p>The media, especially the likes of CNN, MSNBC, PBS and even the weather channel go out of their way to employ half-ricans and bit-o-kins to successfully fool the gullible that they&rsquo;re just like the rest. </p>
<p>How about some real blacks CNN?  </p>
