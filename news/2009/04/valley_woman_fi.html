<h1>Valley Woman Files &#8216;Reverse Discrimination&rsquo; Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KGBT-TV (Harlingen, Texas), April 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Anglo woman filed a &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; lawsuit against a Rio Grande Valley assisted-living community based on alleged harassment for not speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>Court records show that San Benito resident Margaret Trafford filed a federal lawsuit against the Canterbury Court assisted living center on Friday.</p>
<p>Trafford worked as the Harlingen center&rsquo;s marketing director between June 2007 and October 2007.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that she was the only Anglo director while the rest were all Hispanic.</p>
<p>Trafford claims she was discriminated against because of her race and not speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old woman alleges that the other directors would constantly speak Spanish to her and non-Spanish speaking residents even after they told they didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The San Benito woman says she was given a disciplinary notice when she tried to bring those and other complaints to the attention of management.</p>

BTW, there is only discrimination. There is no &#8220;reverse discrimination.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The plight of anglos in the RGV absolutely dire.  We are a tiny minority (less than 5%&hellip;.guess) and some of the Mexicans feel driven to constantly remind us that we are &#8220;guests&#8221; in their country.  My poor wife was just recently driven out of her job of 7 years by a racist supervisor who took great pleasure in making fun of her poor Spanish!</p>
<p>In fairness, most of the Mexicans here are very fair and welcoming but there are some determined to make life hell for any Gringo trying to live here.</p>
<p>Coming to a city near you.</p>

		<p>I hope she wins millions. If they don&rsquo;t speak English, odds are they are illegal. In Raytown, Missouri I was getting my driver&rsquo;s license renewal. The person ahead of me had brought an interpeter because they couldn&rsquo;t speak English. Now how can you get a license when you can&rsquo;t even read the road signs? </p>

		<p>Staff spoke Spanish to non-Spanis speakers etc.</p>
<p>Nothing new here. This has happened in various places in El Norte, Aztlan, (sometimes known as California) for years. You know what? The Mexicans who speak Spanish to non-Spanish speakers do it on purpose and they revel in it, they literally enjoy getting their kicks doing it. I&rsquo;ve seen it and experienced it over and over. They know they&rsquo;ve won the cultural struggle as to who will call the shots in California. </p>
<p>California should be a lesson and a warning to Americans everywhere, but it won&rsquo;t be. All one needs to do is read news stories involving California politics, but not those stories on California written in the useless rags across this nation that  are known as newspapers. </p>

<p>Now we know why.</p>

<p>Hey Peejay - It happened to me in Santa Rosa and now here in Vancouver.  Forget about getting a job with the county or city if you are a White male, unless you have outstanding qualifications for a specific skill.  And we have people directly from Africa showing up everywhere.  The Hispanics just stand in your way in the stores and talk loudly in Spanish, laughing often.  I can guess what they are talking about since I know a little Spanish.  (I know what &#8220;cinga&#8221; means).</p>
<p>I am getting down to an emergency situation.  It will play out this year.  I wish some wealthy nationalist would buy up a bunch of land in Wyoming or somewhere and invite in people like us to develop our own community.  See, I am starting to fantascize a solution.  But,,&hellip;. how about a non-profit org for displaced Americans?  I would help, but have little money and less all the time.  If we loose our grip here, I don&rsquo;t know where we will go&hellip;</p>
