<h1>UNC Students Stand Up for University Access for Illegals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristin Collins, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), April 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students across the University of North Carolina system this week are staging rallies and signing petitions, saying it&rsquo;s time to stand up in support of illegal immigrants who want to go to college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The N.C. Community College System is considering whether it should allow them to attend, and several bills are pending in the legislature  &mdash;  some that would deny illegal immigrants access to higher education and some that would guarantee their right to it.</p>
<p>At the federal level, members of Congress are once again considering the DREAM Act, which would allow some students who came into the U.S. illegally to attend college and earn citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year more and more students are denied access to college and their lives are ruined,&#8221; said Ronald Bilbao, a UNC-Chapel Hill senior who founded the statewide College Access Coalition last year. &#8220;If people start making noise, then perhaps our politicians will do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under intense pressure, the community colleges have since closed their degree programs to those who can&rsquo;t prove legal residency while the colleges study the issue, a process that could take more than a year. Those who oppose allowing illegal immigrant students say that only legal residents should have the benefit of scarce public resources, such as university slots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students who participated in this week&rsquo;s events, which included rallies at UNC-CH and N.C. State University and a large walkout at UNC-Asheville, say they think all people should have the right to an education. They point out that undocumented students pay out-of-state tuition, which means their attendance at colleges and universities costs the state nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just basic human rights,&#8221; said Jezzette Danielle Rivera, a junior at NCSU whose grandparents emigrated from Mexico. &#8220;Denying a person the right to learn is just unfair.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The students in this article aren&rsquo;t doing this by themselves, there is some professor(s) behind it all.  They simply want more students, ergo more tuition, which will usually come from Federal grants and loans.</p>

			<p>Why would anyone over 30 listen to a damn thing that a college student, more specifically an undergrad, has to say? These clowns live in their own little idealistic world, are told what they want to hear and it&rsquo;s all financed by someone other than themselves. They are so pitifully pig-ignorant that they are helping their own competition, competition that already has an edge on them by NOT being white. </p>

			<p>I think the taxpayer&rsquo;s should have a say in this after all! Little do these brainwashed spoiled college students that are Americans realize they are displacing Americans from these college seats and forcing the taxpayer to subsidize this. In addition to the college students future kids. </p>

<p>Illegal migrants should not be in the USA in the first place. As for going to college, Mexico has plenty of colleges, let them go to college in their OWN country. Saying that their lives are &#8220;ruined&#8221; because they can&rsquo;t go to a US college is patently ridiculous. As far the comment that they pay out-of-state tuition rates, those are expensive and many americans can&rsquo;t afford to go out of state. It would be much cheaper for mexicans to go in their own country.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s equally unfair to break into another country, ask that everything be in another language, demand privileges and then accuse the very people you&rsquo;re groveling to of being racists.  Besides, as an earlier poster pointed out, most college students don&rsquo;t know anything. They don&rsquo;t know themselves or what they want out of life and don&rsquo;t understand the long-term consequences of their immediate actions.  I remember being in college and swallowing some of these liberal, socialists, &#8220;multicultural&#8221; ideas until I got out of college.  </p>

			<p>Stories like this makes my blood boil. I&rsquo;ve lived in NC 10 years (11-21)and it has really opened my eyes to race relations and the problem of immigration. Since then I&rsquo;ve moved back to Hawaii and the immigration problem isn&rsquo;t as profound since I don&rsquo;t see it as I did back in NC but this is a stark reminder of what&rsquo;s still going on back in the mainland.</p>

			<p>Jezzette Danielle Rivera is quoted in the article: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just basic human rights &hellip; Denying a person the right to learn is just unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Jezzette needs to walk into a public library, open a book and start reading.  No one will deny her anything.  There is a huge world of knowledge available to her.  I hope she makes good use of it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d imagine most of these &#8216;students&rsquo; are like Jezzette Danielle Rivera: immigrants, or the children of immigrants.  They&rsquo;re just trying to justify their own presence.</p>
<p>But what none of these people seem to realize is that the more non-traditional Americans are in America, the more America will be like &#8216;The Old Country&rsquo;.  If one is an immigrant, one should see other immigrants as a threat.  Other immigrants only dilute and consume those qualities which made America worth coming to.</p>
<p>Once, I had plans to escape Mississippi.  Before immigration ruined California and the &#8216;sand states&rsquo;, we were the lousiest state in the union.  It wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;conditions&rsquo; that made it so bad, it was the people: all the waves of stupid people (some black; some &#8216;olive&rsquo;; but most, extremely white) whom my ancestors and their peers had imported to work the fields.  I ruled out Dallas and Atlanta as destinations, because there were too many Mississippians in those places.</p>
<p>I chose Seattle.  Surely there would be few there from my home state. People were smart there, and could think beyond beauty contests and football games.  And when I&rsquo;d hear of someone from here who had moved to Seattle, I&rsquo;d feel a little sick.  I was sure that the presence of that Mississippian would change Washington State just a little&hellip;and for the worse.  Those other Mississippians would be degrading the place&hellip;messing things up for me.  I was probably right.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t third-worlders grasp that concept?  The more people who are here from your home country, the more America will be like your home country. You left your home country because it was a lousy place where good things did not happen. Mass immigration totally negates any gains you would have made by moving here.  If America is swamped with immigrants, you might as well have stayed at home.  </p>
<p>Why is this so hard for certain people to understand? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for illegal immigrants attending college  &mdash;  in their home countries.  How about returning home and attending college there?  May I move to Mexico and expect entrance to college without getting prior permission?</p>

			<p>    Crossing our borders illegally is a crime which makes anybody that does that a &#8220;criminal&#8221;.  However criminals in jail here in the U.S.A. have been getting college educations for free at the taxpayers expense for years while honest hard working citizens must sacrifice and save every dime just to afford to send their children to college. <br>
    In view of this these illegal alien &#8220;criminals&#8221; should be sent to &#8220;Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s tent city&#8221; where they can get the greatest education of a lifetime.                          </p>

			<p>Colleges will be among the hardest hit, during this ongoing financial decline.  Many will cut back drastically in order to just survive.  Many will also fail and be forced to close their doors.</p>
<p>It makes a person wonder why organizations of learning don&rsquo;t  know it is incredibly unwise to play at social engineering when the money for it could be used as a rainy day fund to get them through hard times.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t know that, then they need to close, because they don&rsquo;t have the knowledge to teach anybody anything worthwhile.</p>

			<p>One thing that occurs to me upon reading the complete original article.  &mdash;  The &#8220;reporter&#8221; (who is legendary in NC for being an open borders shill  &mdash;  check her archives) fails to give the readers any idea whatsoever of the numbers of UNC system students involved in this movement. My guess is that it is a two or three dozen wild-eyed woolly headed freaks at most. She also fails to give any idea of the numbers of students who publicly oppose this sort of lunacy. I can tell you from my anecdotal historical observations of on line commentary in The Daily Tarheel (UNC-CH student newspaper) that there are numerous UNC students who are vocally opposed to this sort of madness.</p>

			<p>Those college students who are for this should be told that THEY must give up their place in college and their financial aid should go to these illegals. Let&rsquo;s see how long they sing that tune.</p>

			<p>Many illegals are illiterate in Spanish, and never completed Elementary or High School. How in Sam Hill are they going to comprehend College-level curriculum ? When the la raza studies dept. indoctrinates these 3rd World rejects, the US will quickly descend into a giant entitlement sanctuary for infantile minorities.<br>
