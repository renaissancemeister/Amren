<h1><a href="https://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107">A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey S. Passel and D&rsquo;Vera Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unauthorized immigrants living in the United States are more geographically dispersed than in the past and are more likely than either U.S. born residents or legal immigrants to live in a household with a spouse and children. In addition, a growing share of the children of unauthorized immigrant parents  &mdash;  73%  &mdash;  were born in this country and are U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>These are among the key findings of a new analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center, which builds on previous work estimating the size and growth of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population. A 2008 report by the Center estimated that 11.9 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the United States; it concluded that the undocumented immigrant population grew rapidly from 1990 to 2006 but has since stabilized. In this new analysis, the Center estimates that the rapid growth of unauthorized immigrant workers also has halted; it finds that there were 8.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. labor force in March 2008. </p>
<p>Based on March 2008 data collected by the Census Bureau, the Center estimates that unauthorized immigrants are 4% of the nation&rsquo;s population and account for 5.4% of its workforce. Their children, both those who are unauthorized immigrants themselves and those who are U.S. citizens, make up 6.8% of the students enrolled in the nation&rsquo;s elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>About three-quarters (76%) of the nation&rsquo;s unauthorized immigrants are Hispanic. The majority of undocumented immigrants (59%) are from Mexico. Significant regional sources of unauthorized immigrants include Asia (11%), Central America (11%), South America (7%), the Caribbean (4%) and the Middle East (less than 2%).</p>
<p>These estimates are based mainly on data from March Current Population Surveys, conducted by the Census Bureau, through 2008, augmented with legal status assignments and adjusted to compensate for undercount; some estimates are from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. For more details, see the report&rsquo;s Methodology appendix.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see:</p>
<p>300 million people in the U.S.</p>
<p>4% are illegal immigrants</p>
<p>means 12,000,000 illegal immigrants</p>
<p>Does anyone in their right mind believe there are only 12 million immigrants in the country?</p>
<p>My hunch is closer to 25 million. </p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s much higher than 12 million.  I have heard estimates of 30 million, which would make one out of every ten person in America here illegally.</p>

			<p>One big smokescreen&hellip;to hide the real number of illegals.<br>
Consider..there are 3 million illegals in Los Angeles metro<br>
area alone. California has 7 million, Texas 3 million&hellip;<br>
every town in the USA has a its illegal population&hellip;<br>
my hometown in Maryland of 8500 pop. has a large illegal <br>
population serviced by 4 latino grocery stores a new<br>
community center, discos, storefront churches&hellip;etc etc.</p>
<p>Nope..the illegal population is 10-12% of USA..minimum<br>
Thats 25-30 million  </p>

			<p>In related news, Texas Democrats want Texas Governor Rick Perry to disavow talk of succssion.  Isn&rsquo;t this the same Governor Perry that refused to discuss anchor baby legislation when asked?  Texas will be Mexico soon, the point will be moot.</p>

<p>The same is true of the government stats saying blacks comprise 10-12% of U.S. population. I and others think it is more like 45% black. Very sneaky, these blacks and muslims.</p>

			<p>Had a friend who got suckered into becoming a &#8220;mentor&#8221; for a &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; Mexican kid, here in Central Florida.  The father was in federal penitentiary on drug trafficking charges.  The mom was a 30 something senora, with 3 kids  &mdash;  a 17 year old son, a 15 year old daughter, and an 11 year old boy.  My friend &#8220;mentored&#8221; the 11 year old.  This consisted of taking him out to movies, for pizza, maybe going to a local pro-wrestling card; you get the picture.  The program was supposed to supply a father figure, and, I guess, instill some white values into these kids (but this was never mentioned as a goal).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the 17 year old boy wound up living with his 14 year old Mexican girlfriend  &mdash;  the mom gave her son and this underage girl her bed, while mom slept on the sofa.  I asked my friend what kind of influence he was making?  After all, if I was a pre teen Mexican kid, what would I desire?  Would I want to be like an &#8220;old&#8221; white guy, or, conversely, would I want to be like my older brother  &mdash;  sleeping with a 14 year old Mexican hottie in my mom&rsquo;s bed?  I told my friend he was simply wasting his time.</p>
<p>To make the story shorter, the kid&rsquo;s old man was released from stir, and deported to Mexico.  The kid told my friend that his family was moving to Texas in order to be close to the father.  My friend went for one last visit, to bring a present, but the family had already upped and moved&hellip;didn&rsquo;t even bother to say goodbye.  My kind hearted friend was pretty upset that the boy, whom he&rsquo;d spent a lot of time and money on, never even thought to call him up before he left.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about immigrations for awhile.</p>
<p>1) America is not a nation of immigrants. It is a nation of citizens, native born or naturalized. Those who are not citizens are guests and may even enjoy the status of immigrant.(who should be here by invitaion, ideally).</p>
<p>2) The &#8220;native&#8221; &#8220;Americans&#8221; are not the original inhabitants of the geographic area currently identified as The United States of America. They themselves came from elsewhere way the hell back when. However, they did not &#8220;immigrate&#8221; here; the migrated here. &#8220;Immigration&#8221; is a legal concept.</p>
<p>3) Technically &#8220;immigration&#8221; refers to a citizen of Nation A travelling from Nation A to live in Nation B, usually with the idea of permanent settlement in Nation B and becoming a legal citizen of Nation B. This immigration is attended by a formal process that results in the legal recognition of the status of the individual.</p>
<p>4) If a citizen of Nation A travels to Nation B without engaging in the legal process of immigration, that citizen of Nation A is NOT immigrating to Nation B. He can not therefore be considered an immigrant, undocumented, unauthorized or otherwise. This person is in violation of the laws of Nation B. This person is an unapprehended criminal trespasser - an illegal alien.</p>
<p>5) In order to implement a process of immigration a nation needs to be in control of its borders and needs to be able to identify persons defined in (4) above. If these conditions are not met, a process of immigration is not possible. It is then a law enforcement problem and must be dealt with first. Borders must be secured and illegal aliens apprehended and removed.</p>
<p>Therefore, to talk about &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; in the same sentence with &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; in nonsensical. Legalizing illegal aliens is simply abandoning the laws of the land and admitting the capitulation of law enforcement. It is surrender, pure and simple.</p>
<p>So whatever happened to the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Tread on Me&#8221; spirit? You certainly won&rsquo;t find it in Congress and let&rsquo;s not even mention that other place down in DC.<br>
