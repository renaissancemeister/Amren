<h1>Sarasota Teen Shot Over Confederate Apparel, Police Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarasota Herald-Tribune, April 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Sarasota Military Academy student has been arrested in the shooting of another teenager in downtown Sarasota Friday night.</p>
<p>Police say Michael J. Mitchell, 18, shot Dan. A. Azeff, 18, in the chest at about 10:40 p.m. Friday in the 1900 block of Main Street. Azeff, a student at Sarasota High School, was flown to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, where he is listed in serious but stable condition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mitchell and Azeff were walking down Main Street last night, both with separate groups of friends. The two did not know each other. Azeff was wearing a hat with a Confederate flag on it and carrying a Confederate flag. Mitchell confronted Azeff, reportedly asking him if he was a racist. The two got into an argument and Mitchell pulled out a gun and shot Azeff once in the chest.</p>

			<p>When blacks see someone that they identify as an enemy they </p>
<p>attack. If a black says he hates Whites and wants to kill them, </p>
<p>Whites shrug their shoulders and say &#8220;aw shucks&#8221;. So my point is </p>
<p>this, people that are willing to use street justice usually win. </p>
<p>If you have studied history you will know this is true.</p>

			<p>I hope this thug is sent to the slammer for a long, long time.  Maybe his cell will be next to a skinhead&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;ll learn the real meaning of racist!</p>
<p>I blame the media and liberals for this sad story.  They&rsquo;ve been vilifying anything Confederate for a long time and this isn&rsquo; the first time violence is the result.</p>
<p>Remember the white guy in Kentucky who was literally killed over Confederate memorabilia?<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what crime Azeff will be convitcted of, but undoubtedly he will be spun into the perpetrator here, antogonizing, hate-criming, bringing hundreds of years of suppressed rage to the surface, etc.</p>
<p>Be prepard for the history of Rosewood, Liberty City oppression, and the introduction of the &#8220;Sarasota One.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The great 60s civil &#8220;rights&#8221; victory is still being celebrated by the victors. While no White, non-&#8220;Black&#8221; Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian is now safe, that is especially true of Whites, whether or not they acknowledge their heritage.</p>
<p>We are always quick to blame the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; for this sorry state of affairs. We should, though, put the blame where it lies - with the corrupt legal/political system that enables and fosters such behavior. </p>

			<p><i>Mitchell, of the 5300 block of Southerly Way, was arrested at his house early todayon a charge of aggravated battery with a firearm.</i></p>
<p>He intentionally shot a man in the chest, and the charge is not attempted murder? The fact that the accused attended a military academy and (presumably) received firearms training should be seen as an agravating factor as well, much like a professional boxer who draws a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon (his hands) after a bar room fist fight.</p>

			<p>Blacks will never give up violence in the USA or in any nation they inhabit but do not absolutely own, be there 20 of them or 200 million. Violence becomes a power that is a reason unto itself. Being rewarded for it, as they are in the USA, is merely a bonus. It will continue rewarded or condemned. When whites are gone it will be Hispanics and Asians, and always black women. </p>

<p>Friends, blacks complain they&rsquo;re targeted by the police. Just the opposite is true. In our PC nightmare, blacks have been given the right to attack &#8216;racists&rsquo; with impunity.</p>
<p>As we all know, &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; were never meant to be applied to blacks.<br>

			<p>This is outrageous, blacks obviously feel justified in taking such actions when they preceive something as &#8220;racist&#8221;:. Another recent example was the Auburn city councilman who felt justified in destroying numerous small Confederate flags that were placed on the graves of Confederate soldiers on Confederate Memorial Day by The United Daughters of the Confederacy and by  decendents who were attempting to honor them.  Black Auburn Councilman Arthur L. Dowdell destroyed the flags because &#8220;it was offensive to me.&#8221; This self-righteous fool then said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going on the record that this will never happen again as long as I&rsquo;m on the city council.&rdquo; With role models like this, the shooting was almost predictible.</p>

Sadly enough, there are white people out there who will actually open their pathetic, mealy mouths and say this young man deserved what happened to him. </p>

			<p>And the liberals will rally at Mitchell&rsquo;s side saying Azeff was guilty of &#8220;hate&#8221; speech.  &#8220;Freedom of speech&#8221;, as we are continuously reminded on Amren, is only free in the U.S. if you think, act, and talk like a liberal, otherwise you deserve the consequences coming to you for stating your beliefs.    </p>

			<p>How the media will handle this when the trial starts should be interesting. I fear we may have another Jenna 6 fiasco in the making. The defendant will most likely try to gain sympathy by claiming he was provoked by a racist t-shirt, etc, and play the race card to excuse his crime. It worked in Jenna, why not here?</p>

			<p>I am sick to death of the black on white crime in this country, the underreporting that goes with it and the pathetic charges and &#8220;punishments&#8221; that these thugs get. If this were a white fellow that shot a black teen for wearing a Malcolm X T-Shirt, you can be certain that the white would be charged with attempted murder and a &#8220;Bias/Hate&#8221; crime on top of it. I read about this yesterday and decided to make a petition demanding the prosecutor charge this savage with a hate crime. I doubt it will make a difference in this case but maybe when I get enough signatures, print it and mail it to the District Attorney, they will see that there are alot of voters out there who are getting thier hackles raised by seeing this sort of thing all too often. Tiny URL wouldn&rsquo;t work for me so if you would please sign this to show these people that there is a large bloc that are getting very aggravated hearing such things happening everyday and seeing these thugs getting away with it. I&rsquo;ve already got about 75 signatures on it and I hope to get more. I know it&rsquo;s not much but it&rsquo;s all I know to do to have my voice heard. I am fairly young and quite new at fighting this fight and since discovering this site I have become inspired to do anything that I can. My petition can be read here:  <br>
<a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/sarasotahatecrime/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/sarasotahatecrime/</a><br>
Thank you all. Lets make sure our voices are heard. <br>

<p>Is that a fact?  I have studied history and I have learned two things:</p>
<p>1) People who use &#8220;street justice&#8221; usually wind up in jail (if caught)</p>
<p>2) Whites used to use &#8220;street justice&#8221; quite a bit, both in the history of this country and in Europe.  What did it get us?</p>
<p>The only people who &#8220;usually win&#8221; are those who achieve state power and take the necessary steps to keep it.  THAT you will find in the history books.</p>
<p><br>
Michael J. Mitchell is your run-of-the-mill black thug this country&rsquo;s dysfunctional educational system saw fit to put in a military academy.  He belongs in prison for a nice, long stretch.  Unfortunately, the state of Florida has already saw fit to charge him with the lesser charge of &#8220;aggravated battery with a firearm&#8221; instead of attempted 2nd degree murder, which is what he is really guilty of doing.</p>

			<p>This whole thing is stupid there were many black soldiers under the flag of the confederacy and there were many blacks who owned slaves<br>
in South Carolina where there were over 500 slaves that were owned by blacks. There has not been true examination of the number of slaves that were owned by blacks because it is not P.C. to do so.<br>
When people yield to P.C. brain washing it can only lead to hate.<br>
It is time for the true facts to come out that both whites and blacks had slaves and were victims of the society that they were in. There is no need for hate and creating more pain and suffering.<br>
Peace and good will to everyone.</p>

			<p>I guess this is the best example of what has been meant by &#8220;Black Empowerment&#8221; over the past forty years.  Now that they have their man in office, they feel that it is not such a big deal to question any &#8220;suspicious&#8221; White and deal out &#8220;justice.&#8221;  I hope the Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity pioneers are proud of the state of affairs we now have in society.  They no doubt are&hellip;</p>

In actuality slavery was the issue, but in a round about way.  It was made the issue by Northern Christians (mainly Methodists) who saw it as a means to political power.  It was during that war that they also pushed through a resolution to have &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221; stamped onto or printed on all U.S. legal tender.  I have Robert E. Lee in my ancestry and I recognize that.<br>

			<p>I went to the website of the Sarasota Military Academy.  Pretty good website.  The school has just completed its five year probationary status and has been warded full academic certification from whomever grants such status to new schools.</p>
<p>Looking at all of the pictures I saw only white people, no blacks.</p>
<p>Part way down the web page was this posting:</p>
<p>&#8220;MENTORING</p>
<p>Sarasota Military Academy has coupled with Friendship Voluteer Center to provide MENTORING to students that may need positive adult encouragement.  This program is called &#8220;Miracle Mile of Mentoring&#8221;, and uses volunteer recruits from the &#8220;mile&#8221; around the campus.  Volunteers are trained and receive a security clearance. These volunteers are professionals in the area and are released from work to meet with a student for (approx) one hour a week, on the school grounds.  The activity that takes place during the time the mentor and mentee spend together is dictated by the need(s) of the student.  It may be reading together, doing homework, setting up a time management program, setting goals, or simply talking.  This is a very successful program and can a student&rsquo;s life forever.  If you have a child that could benefit from this program, please contact Major Donehew.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next but separate section from the website reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;On February 14, three SMA cadets and Major Donehew went to Cyesis High School to model a &#8220;Read Aloud&#8221; to the student mommies and their babies.  This program, &#8220;For the Love of Reading&#8221;, is in its fourth year and is sponsored by the Sarasota Reading Council.  After the mommies and babies are read to, they go to the school media center where they are presented with a display of children&rsquo;s literature that comes complete with a soft, cuddly animal from the story.  The babies get to take their pick.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it sounds like this Mitchell may be a part of the mentor program and not a formal SMA student.  Ultimately, I guess he was pissed that he didn&rsquo;t get his soft, cuddly animal as did everyone else.  We&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>Does anyone down in Florida have any info on this Cyesis High School?  What are the demographics?  How many whites?  How many blacks? </p>

			<p>This is the future of America. Whatever the issue is, if many non-whites disagree with a caucasian on some pet peeve of theirs, that caucasian individual, group, etc. could be in danger, serious danger. The truth is, caucasian Americans have brought this upon themselves, and if they were honest, they&rsquo;d admit it.</p>

			<p>Why is it that when such crimes occur, we almost always know now that the perp. is going to be black.  It is the same in the UK where one fool sent to jail for a murder even published a picture of himself just before on Facebook, prominently holding up the weapon he used to murder, a kitchen knife; with the usual arrogant look on his face of course.  Looking at the montages of thsoe nwho have murdered in te streets, the rates would be cut by 8/10s if blacks were present to commit them.</p>

			<p>&#8221; Sarasota Military Academy? &#8221; This punk must have been sent there because he was a trouble maker and his parent was beside herself or he was on an athletic scholarship because he could run or dunk. Why would a teenager need to pack heat walking down the pike? Would it be he was selling dope or getting ready to jack some old lady. I loved his eyes; the raw hate was refreshing.<br>
     Come on down Jesse and Sharpo. Free the victim of racism who was justified to defending his race from degenerates who honor their forefathers. They should both be charged, Mitchell with discharging a fire arm in public and the honky with aggravated hate crime.<br>

			<p>A lot of it will depend on what the statue actually says.  You need to look up the law, &#8220;AGGRAVATED BATTERY&#8221;  might be the legal term they are using for &#8220;attempted murder&#8221;.</p>

			<p>It is even more irritating to read the comments by the kid&rsquo;s grandparent, the one that got shot. He was practically bowing to the blacks and talking about how he told the kid not to bring that stuff in his house. He was referring to the confederate flags and hat. He said people down south don&rsquo;t like that junk and that we know it means hate and on and on. </p>
<p>Sorry old man, but not where I come from. I love and respect the confederate flag and don&rsquo;t see it as a symbol of hate</p>

<p>Is that a fact? I have studied history and I have learned two things:</p>
<p>1) People who use &ldquo;street justice&rdquo; usually wind up in jail (if caught)</p>
<p>2) Whites used to use &ldquo;street justice&rdquo; quite a bit, both in the history of this country and in Europe. What did it get us?</p>
<p>The only people who &ldquo;usually win&rdquo; are those who achieve state power and take the necessary steps to keep it. THAT you will find in the history books.</p>

Michael J. Mitchell is your run-of-the-mill black thug this country&rsquo;s dysfunctional educational system saw fit to put in a military academy. He belongs in prison for a nice, long stretch. Unfortunately, the state of Florida has already saw fit to charge him with the lesser charge of &ldquo;aggravated battery with a firearm&rdquo; instead of attempted 2nd degree murder, which is what he is really guilty of doing.</p>

<p>But how did they get state power? They went out in the streets and fought for it!! Blacks marched and then black gangs ethnically cleansed neighborhoods of Whites. Look at Los Angeles as the finest example of this. Now the Latinos are doing the same thing. At first you go to jail and then you win. If I was wrong why does the PC crowd, gays, feminists and blacks have the whip over us WHITE FOLKS? They got the power of the state by winning the fight on the streets!</p>

			<p>Many, possibly most, black males are just LOOKING for an excuse to attack a White. For many black males beating a White is a virtual rite of passage for them. They will use any claim of &#8220;racism&#8221; to rationalize the action. They are inately violent and hostile towards Whites. Just reality folks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After the mommies and babies are read to, they go to the school media center where they are presented with a display of children&rsquo;s literature that comes complete with a soft, cuddly animal from the story. The babies get to take their pick.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Interesting that the Mommies must be read to as well as the babies.  And how many Mommies are pregnant with their 2nd baby because of those wonderful black Military Academy boys who were sent to mentor them?<br>

<p>Do you honestly believe everything the blacks have today is because they &#8220;fought for it&#8221;?  Look around you.  Most blacks can&rsquo;t organize a group of one.  Even the NAACP wasn&rsquo;t started exclusively by blacks.  Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING they have was given to them by someone else!</p>
<p>By the way, the blacks don&rsquo;t have state power.  What they have is state protection.  Of course, if things continue at the present rate one day they shall have it (unless of course, the latinos get it first).</p>
<p>&#8220;They got the power of the state by winning the fight on the streets!&#8221;</p>
<p>DEAD WRONG!!!  They got it because the left-leaning DNC used them to get it.  When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &amp; the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Reform Act of 1965 were passed Whites were still the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of people in this country.  They didn&rsquo;t &#8220;get anything!&#8221;  Whites spinelessly (and stupidly) gave it to them.</p>

			<p>LOL, what a perfect story to illustrate the gulf between blacks and whites.  How do you grow up in America to be the sort of &#8220;person&#8221; who shoots someone over a shirt and hat?  Get born black I suppose!</p>

			<p>This story is a great example of the argument for concealed carry.  As soon as this sort of confrontation with a black turns &#8220;ugly,&#8221; one produces one&rsquo;s sidearm (not necessarily pointing it) and mentions that one doesn&rsquo;t get into fist fights, but gun fights.  If he doesn&rsquo;t keep his hands away from his sides whilst moving away (or turn and leave)&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, concealed carry means you probably can&rsquo;t go &#8216;round in public in Confederate Shirts or hats or similar apparel.</p>

<p>This is why I say the muslims are a much greater threat than they are credited with. These muslim extremists control the greater percentage of muslims BECAUSE!!! they are willing to kill those that don&rsquo;t conform to their ideas/ideaology and are even willing to kill themselves. <br>

<p>Another historical error.  Go back and read your history more closely.  Blacks wound up controlling both of those countries because of the VAST INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE exerted on those places by countries like the United States.  International sanctions such as embargoes can work wonders if done the right way.</p>
<p>Rhodesia and White-run South Africa fell because they were reduced to pariah status.  Left to their own devices, the armies of both countries could have easily dealt with the problems of black insurgents, but that would have invited foreign invasion.</p>
