<h1>Black Coaches Group Gives CSU an F for Women&rsquo;s Basketball Hiring</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Duff, Coloradoan (Fort Collins, Colorado), April 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Black Coaches &amp; Administrators gave CSU&rsquo;s athletic department an F today in its second annual women&rsquo;s basketball coaches hiring report.</p>
<p>The BCA said Colorado State University failed in four categories last spring when it chose Kristen Holt to be the Rams&rsquo; coach.</p>
<p>Holt, who is white, was named coach March 26, 2008, the same day Jen Warden was fired after a 4-28 season, the worst in the program&rsquo;s history. Holt, who had been an assistant for one season under Warden, led the Rams to a 10-21 record this year, an improvement of six wins.</p>
<p>Holt, who originally signed a one-year contract, received a four-year extension during the season.</p>
<p>The BCA said CSU received Fs in the following categories: communication with the BCA, hiring/search committee, candidates interviewed and reasonable time. The school&rsquo;s overall grade was an F as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We promoted internally,&#8221; Susemihl [Christine Susemihl, CSU&rsquo;s senior associate athletic director] said. &#8220;I think we felt we had a very strong internal candidate and someone who had had Division I head coaching experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susemihl said Holt&rsquo;s hiring was done in conformity with the university&rsquo;s Office of Equal Opportunity,</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CSU received an A from the BCA when it hired Steve Fairchild, who is white, as football coach prior to the 2008 season. Zak Gilbert, CSU&rsquo;s director of media relations, said the BCA provides annual report cards on the hiring of athletic directors, head football coaches and head women&rsquo;s basketball coaches.</p>

I would say let black have basketball if they stopped their whining about other sports. But we all know, it&rsquo;s a one-way street and they want absolute control. No amount of concessions will ever satisfy a black man.</p>
<p>Fade to black.</p>

			<p>Oppose this sort of nonsense: it is a scam.</p>
<p>All, that is ALL, &#8216;black associations&rsquo; of &#8216;professional&rsquo; &#8216;union&rsquo; or whatever title they deploy for their theft of the public purse, are EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATIONS intended to fill all positions middle and higher with &#8216;blacks&rsquo;, </p>
<p>that is descendants of the Atlantic slave trade, the progeny of the african rejects making it to the promised land of the USA, instead of  Brazil or Saudi Arabia, or just being executed in africa to be a messenger to the afterlife by wealthy african tribesman. </p>
<p>Africans and dispossed intellectual white sychophants melanin intoxicated, think that all wealth is stolen from the coloreds,or the proletariat and that all of society&rsquo;s positions are just rewards for being a good clan member.</p>
<p>For those infected with this meme, there is no communicating, for to them a level playing field or playing fair or by the rules is just a tool used by the oppressors to dispossess the coloreds. </p>
<p>Note that &#8216;blacks&rsquo; are descendants of the atlantic slave trade except that obama gets a pass because his mother&rsquo;s ancestors were slave owners, and obama&rsquo;s East African Luo tribe ancestors were slave sellers of the West African sub tribes, </p>
<p>Hawaiian Barry has an Indonesian sister, from the step father who adopted him in Malaysia and sent him to the Islamic elementary school. Does this imposter know how to fish or hunt, or been in the Boy Scouts?? </p>

			<p>I wish sports would just fade away.  What type of person sits on the couch and watchs sports anyway.  If you want sports in your life, go out and run, get involved in an informal basketball team, ski, play polo, swim, whatever, but don&rsquo;t live you life through others.  I consider sports akin to porn  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t watch it, do it!</p>

			<p>I wonder what would have been the outcome if Holt has proved to be a worse coach, although this would have taken a great deal of effort!! Would she be blamed for being a lousy coach or because she is White? Of course, by the same token, was Warden black? If so, was she fired for doing a lousy job or because she is black?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t CSU award 60% pass grade to black students just for showing up for classes, or is that HBCU? </p>

			<p>Sports is comprised of thugs, players, adulters, and a big money whore.  I avoid it.</p>

			<p>Where is this black racist groups&rsquo; &#8220;diversity or affirmative action plan for Original-Americans (Euro-stock ) or Asian-Americans ? Especially since we intergrated unconstitutionally for them since 1947 Military/&rsquo;54 Brown vs Topeka Bd.of Ed. and created organized sports to boot with much betterment for them .</p>
