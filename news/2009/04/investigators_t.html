<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/us/politics/14jackson.html?_r=2">Investigators Take Closer Look at Rep. Jackson in Blagojevich Case</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Saulny and Christopher Drew, New York Times, April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [A] nagging question follows [Jesse Jackson Jr.]: Was [his] December meeting with Mr. Blagojevich a good-faith effort to land the Senate job or a charade to conceal behind-the-scenes maneuvers with Mr. Blagojevich to pay to play?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Rick Bryant, a spokesman for Mr. Jackson, said the congressman had been focused lately on finding more jobs for his South Side constituents and pushing for economic-development projects, like construction of another airport in Chicago.</p>
<p>Even some of Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s allies say that his political star has been tarnished by the continuing scrutiny  &mdash;  and uncertainty  &mdash;  and that Mr. Jackson has emerged as the politician outside of Mr. Blagojevich&rsquo;s inner circle with the most to lose from the former governor&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The transcripts of wiretap conversations released in the Blagojevich criminal case in December revealed evidence that one of Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s fund-raisers, Raghuveer Nayak, had promised to raise money for Mr. Blagojevich in exchange for Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Chicago Sun-Times reported on Monday that Mr. Blagojevich&rsquo;s people had been told that Mr. Jackson would raise up to $5 million in campaign cash for Mr. Blagojevich.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the excuse that he was too busy helping constituents.  Black members of the U.S. House tend to be lazy in their constituent services.  They don&rsquo;t need to be, because they know they&rsquo;ll get re-elected.  Bill Clay, Sr. was like this in St. Louis, the white congressman from the neighboring district had to help Clay&rsquo;s constituents track down their lost social security checks because their own congressman wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger.  But they voted for him, though.</p>

			<p>Looks like they might have caught Jesse Jr. trying to buy a senate seat.  If that were some Repub trying the same thing he  would have hell to pay.  But Jesse Jr. obviously has nothing to worry about because he&rsquo;s a DEMOCRAT.  It also seems obvious  that dems can cheat on their taxes with impunity.  Charlie Rangle has made a cottage industry in finding ways to cheat on his taxes.  Instead of any consequences he is rewarded with the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee.  Even the new Treasury Secty is a tax cheat and Kansas Governor, Kathleen Sebelius, Obama&rsquo;s appointment for Health Secty is a tax cheat and a liar about the money she is getting from Dr. Tiller, the baby killer.  She is obviously a believer in late term abortions and  will no doubt bring this view with her when she is confirmed. Almost the whole Obama team consists of cheats, liars and crooks.  We better all fasten our seat belts, as Barbara Stanwyck said, &#8220;it&rsquo;s going to be a bumpy ride.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This mealy mouthed buffoon is fire proof.Nothing will come of this unless Obongo is going after it because of Jesse Jacksons open mike gaffe last year when he said he wanted to &#8221; cut Obamas N**&rsquo;s off.&#8221; It never ceases to amaze me how far we have declined as a nation, tolerating feebleminded bums like this occupying our hallowed Congress. Which way Western man ?</p>

			<p>Anyone want to bet that when ROD starts to threaten exposing all that he knows, we will see the first Obamaster pardon. It will be done so the &#8220;country&#8221; can begin the &#8216;healing process&rsquo;</p>
