<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30121523/">Extremist Web Sites Are Using U.S. Hosts</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joby Warrick and Candace Rondeaux, Washington Post, April 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On March 25, a Taliban Web site claiming to be the voice of the &#8220;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&#8221; boasted of a deadly new attack on coalition forces in that country. Four soldiers were killed in an ambush, the site claimed, and the &#8220;mujahideen took the weapons and ammunition as booty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most remarkable about the message was how it was delivered. The words were the Taliban&rsquo;s, but they were flashed around the globe by an American-owned firm located in a leafy corner of downtown Houston.</p>
<p>The Texas company, a Web-hosting outfit called ThePlanet, says it simply rented cyberspace to the group and had no clue about its Taliban connections. For more than a year, the militant group used the site to rally its followers and keep a running tally of suicide bombings, rocket attacks and raids against U.S. and allied troops. The cost of the service: roughly $70 a month, payable by credit card.</p>
<p>The Taliban&rsquo;s account was pulled last week when a blogger noticed the connection and called attention to it. But the odd pairing of violently anti-American extremists and U.S. technology companies continues elsewhere and appears to be growing. Intelligence officials and private experts cite dozens of instances in which Islamist militants sought out U.S. Internet firms  &mdash;  known for their reliable service and easy terms that allow virtual anonymity  &mdash;  and used them to incite attacks on Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The relatively cheap expense and high quality of U.S. servers seems to attract jihadists,&#8221; said Rita Katz, co-founder of the Site Intelligence Group, a private company that monitors the communications of Muslim extremist groups. Even al-Qaeda has sometimes paid American companies to serve as conduits for its hate-filled messages, said Katz, who has tracked such activity since 2003.</p>
<p>Militants&rsquo; use of U.S. Web hosts has sparked occasional spats between the United States and its allies, as well as endless debates over whether it is better to shut down the Web sites when they&rsquo;re discovered or to let them continue to operate. By allowing them to remain online, intelligence analysts can sometimes discover clues about the leadership and structure of terrorist groups, some analysts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Anti-Western propaganda</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Representatives of Tulix and ThePlanet say their policies prohibit the airing of violent or hateful messages by ordinary Americans, and certainly by terrorists. Both companies say they act quickly to shut down any site that breaks the rules.</p>
<p>The user-friendly American services are especially popular with groups like the Tora Bora Front [a Taliban]. &#8220;It kind of makes it an ideal target for people who want to use it for nefarious reasons because not only is it easy to access and easy to use, it&rsquo;s easy to lie about your identity,&#8221; said Thomas Burling, Tulix&rsquo;s chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Burling said the company has &#8220;routinely&#8221; been contacted by various federal agencies tracking the use of the Free Web Town sites, but he declined to go into further detail or identify the agencies.</p>
<p>Under federal eavesdropping laws passed last year, U.S. intelligence officials can legally monitor communications between foreign groups without a warrant, even if the transit lines pass through the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>U.S. server used in Mumbai attack</b></p>
<p>In some cases, the complaints come from governments. Pakistan has been venting to U.S. officials about militants&rsquo; use of North American Internet services since last fall, when an investigation of the Mumbai terrorist rampage, which involved Pakistanis, revealed that the attackers had communicated using Internet phone calls routed through another server based in Houston.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A senior Pakistani official said repeated requests to Washington to shut down controversial sites have gone unheeded  &mdash;  and American authorities&rsquo; seeming reluctance has become &#8220;an irritant.&#8221; The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not cleared to discuss the issue, said Pakistani intelligence experts are convinced that Washington prefers to keep the sites running for intelligence purposes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials acknowledge the dispute but note the futility of trying to turn off Web sites completely. Domain names can be easily changed, they say, and sites are so easy to relocate that a new site usually opens within weeks after the old one is shut down.</p>

			<p>The irony of this is that the Taliban need American freedom of speech to host their websites, but if they get what they want, an America run under Taliban ideology would not be so free. </p>
<p>The WaPo does not say this, but I think the real aim is to stop American servers from hosting Canadian and European sites that are illegally too right wing in their own countries, and of nationalist political parties.</p>

			<p>It seems that every kook, oddball, and misfit on the planet can do whatever he wants using US cyberspace to get his message out so long as it involves those who are non-whites.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s all this hate and bold faced lies coming from the likes of the Daily Kos, the MYT, the SPLC and the ADL, to name but a wee few, and now the terrorists are being allowed free rein.</p>
<p>However, if someone that&rsquo;s a US expert on analyzing current trends and wants to warn people to be aware of chaos, closed malls, a total collapse in the US economy, resulting in revolution and riots, then every boob that has any control over anything is there trying to get the messages banned.  </p>
<p>You Tube is a good example.  All the haters, liars and terrorists on the left can just about record and offer a video on their site about anything, so long as they&rsquo;re not a white conservative or so long as they don&rsquo;t warn us that this leftist climate is set to implode.</p>
<p>Take the trends analysts, like Gerald Celente and Peter Schiff.  Some of the their videos, telling it like it is, are being purged by the YOUTUBE backers, because it&rsquo;s a message they don&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>
<p>Gerald Celent was back on FOx news the first part of April, only this time he was a bit angered and never tried to cloak his language in any kind of nice way and he came right out and angily told it just as it is.</p>
<p>Try the following link to see his latest analysis.  It has been purged in a lot of places but I&rsquo;ve found one web site where it was still being shown.  If you can&rsquo;t get anything but a notice that the video has been taken off because of a violation of server agreement, then you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re too late to see it.</p>

			<p>Its bloody hard to find a true free speech web host anywhere in the world, even in the US. Ever look at the terms of service for most of them?  The terms for my ISP are so bad that even posting here could get my account pulled, and I&rsquo;m not kidding. </p>

			<p><i>So we have to keep Islamic terrorists off the Web but keeping them off airplanes is a civil rights violation?</i></p>
<p>you see, once they use extremism as a reason to deny hosting, soon you&rsquo;ll find that AMeren and other unPC sites will be follow suit&hellip;while keeping muslim terorrists off planes does not help with &#8220;NWO&#8221; long term goals, in fact, ensuring they get on hastens achieving those goals</p>

Make no mistake. This is a blatant attempt to shut down any and all dissent. More &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; laws to follow with greater control and restrictions on the internet.</p>
<p>There are forces that want to limit and define speech and what better way to get people to accept draconian restrictions than by targeting the enemy. But the enemy list will only grow longer as more &#8216;victims&rsquo; demand &#8216;protection&rsquo; from &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m an Australian and I host all of my content on U.S. servers because of the U.S. First Amendment which allows me to say anything I like about how good or bad the Australian government is without having Australian Federal Government agents kicking in my door every time I write words that certain individuals take offence to.</p>
<p>Australia doesn&rsquo;t have Free Speech, it has &#8220;acceptable content&#8221; defined by what isn&rsquo;t &#8220;acceptable&#8221; which is laid out in legislation such as the Sedition Act 2005, the Anti-terrorism Act 2005, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, and the Amended Crimes Act 1914 (a.k.a. the &#8216;Hate Crimes Act&rsquo;).</p>
<p>I am a firm believer that without free speech democracy cannot exist, hence why I use U.S. servers to poke fun at the idiocy of our government leaders. Yes, that does seem a little ironic but at least my government can change if it hears the voices of the people. Other countries, for example Cambodia, have successive communist governments and if you disagree with what they say you can find yourself in a dark, dank cell for the rest of your life.</p>

			<p>It is now many years since Hosni Mubarak addressed the European Parliament - some Parliamentarians ostentatiously walked out as the Egyptian despot began to speak - and observed that Islamic nutters who had been beaten flat in countries like Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Syria and Jordan had regrouped in the safety of prosperous and tolerant Europe; he added that European countries would sooner or later come to regret their liberal tolerance and hospitality. This was before 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London, of course.</p>
<p>That said, let me direct you to 2 sites:</p>
<p>** Redwatch ** is run by British Ultra-Rightists and purports to expose Reds in British public life</p>
<p>** Kavkaz Center ** is a Chechen-run Jihadist site and was based in Sweden the last time I heard.</p>
<p>The interplay of ideas on the Internet is precious and far too precious to be curtailed. Sure, we can all - ALL OF US - think of sites we&rsquo;d like to see shut down [and by WHOM?] but so many liberties are being taken away from us all the time that we ought to adhere unswervingly to the brief slogan <br>
             FREE SPEECH FOR ALL ON THE INTERNET </p>
