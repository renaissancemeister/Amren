			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Caldwell, Eureka Alerts, April 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio  &mdash;  Obesity is twice as common in young American Indian/Native Alaskan children as it is in white and Asian children, according to new research offering the first nationally representative analysis of obesity prevalence among preschool-aged kids in five major racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The analysis also shows that obesity prevalence is higher in Hispanic and black children than it is in whites and Asians.</p>
<p>The research offers evidence that obesity prevalence differs among racial and ethnic groups in the United States in children as young as age 4. This is the first study to include national estimates of obesity prevalence among preschool children who are American Indian/Native Alaskan and Asian.</p>
<p>Overall, an estimated 18.4 percent of 4-year-olds in the United States are considered obese based on measures of their weight relative to their height, according to the study.</p>
<p>The data indicated there are three tiers of obesity prevalence among young children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on body mass index measures, obesity prevalence was estimated at 31.2 percent among American Indian/Native Alaskan children, 22 percent for Hispanics, 20.8 percent in blacks, 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent in Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The implications are that childhood obesity prevention efforts must begin early in life. And these efforts might benefit from better understanding of how differences in obesity risk between racial and ethnic groups emerge so early,&#8221; said Sarah Anderson, assistant professor of epidemiology at Ohio State University and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>Anderson conducted the analysis with Robert Whitaker of Temple University. The research is published in the April issue of Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine.</p>
<p>Anderson and Whitaker analyzed height and weight data collected in 2005 on 8,550 children who were born in the United States in 2001. The data were collected as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort, which is an ongoing study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics to provide information about learning environments, health and development of young U.S. children.</p>
<p>The researchers calculated the body mass index (BMI) of the children using the measured heights and weights of the children. BMI is derived by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.</p>
<p>BMI measures for adults use set numbers to define overweight or obesity, but those numbers do not apply in growing children whose bodies are constantly changing, Anderson explained. In this study of preschool children, BMI measures were converted into percentiles for age and sex based on growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2000.</p>
<p>Children whose BMI scores were at or above the 95th percentile on those charts were referred to as obese for the purposes of this analysis. Because obesity rates based on BMI have been increasing steadily for adults and children in the United States over the years, a total of 18.4 percent of the 4-year-olds studied now rank in what used to represent just the top 5 percent of BMI scores among children of the same age.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s race and ethnicity were defined in part by what their mothers chose using categories established for the U.S. census. The researchers placed each child in one of five mutually exclusive categories: American Indian/Native Alaskan, Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, Asian and non-Hispanic white.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that there are disparities in prevalence of adult obesity across racial/ethnic groups, especially among women. And we know those disparities may contribute to health disparities in diabetes, hypertension and other diseases in adulthood,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly not about stigmatizing any particular subgroups. I think if we understand better how it is that these racial/ethnic disparities have come to be at such a young age, that can help us to design obesity prevention programs that will be useful before children enter school.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted that the data offer no information about the children&rsquo;s health or how much fat their bodies contain. BMI does not measure the actual amount of fat on a person&rsquo;s body, but is an accepted standard measure to use for large population studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;On a population level, the people who have high BMI and are thus defined as obese by our current definitions tend to have high levels of body fat. We are aware that on an individual level, a person can have a high BMI and not have excess body fat. For the U.S. population as a whole, it is a good measure,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>
<p>She also noted that the analysis does not provide information about why these disparities exist. She suggested that future research might focus on families to explore whether racial/ethnic differences in household behaviors and even broader communities somehow affect obesity in kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important from a public health perspective to have data on the characteristics and health of the population and of different subgroups in the population because there&rsquo;s a focus on racial/ethnic disparities in the United States in terms of the long-term health consequences,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Because obesity is so strongly related to many of those later health outcomes, it&rsquo;s important to understand descriptively what the prevalence of obesity is in these different race/ethnicity groups.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Lotsa luck getting the parents to suddenly change their household eating habits!  These tend to be cultural, and are thus difficult to change.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m very fussy about what I feed my son.  He&rsquo;s at the normal height and weight for his age.</p>
<p>People also have to learn that the &#8220;experts&#8221; do not have all the answers.  Would you believe  &mdash;  increasing saturated fat and decreasing polyunsaturated has helped me lose weight?  Also avoid trans-fats.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the MSG that&rsquo;s found in about 95% of KFC&rsquo;s offerings&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Time and again I&rsquo;ve seen it on public transportation, in restaurants, and in the Home Depot: a black or Mexican mother hands a Mylar bag filled with cookies or chips to their toddler or infant, who happily washes this diabetic delight down with corn syrup fortified fruit juice or chocolate milk decanted into a sippy cup. In contrast, White and Asian mothers in public seem to offer their children carrot and celery sticks, fresh fruit, or carefully prepared home meals sealed in Tupperware containers.</p>
<p>Maternity hospitals offer the same lecture on healthy nutrition for children in 120 different languages to expectant mothers, so a lack of public information isn&rsquo;t the problem. I suggest that non-Asian minority (NAM) mothers give their kids unhealthy snacks and meals for two reasons:<br>
 <br>
1) They don&rsquo;t have their act together in the home. Healthy meal preparation for even a small family requires at least an hour of daily effort (if you have three or four kids it&rsquo;s more like two hours daily). It also requires analytic skills to plan and shop for varied meals according to the food pyramid and determine appropriate portion sizes for adults and children. The bulk of NAM mothers are usually poor at all things requiring planning and patient routine. Since their families are usually something that just &#8220;happened&#8221; to them, beginning at an early age, why should we surprised that their approach to reproduction and food consumption seem similarly unplanned.</p>
<p>2) Black and Hispanic kids are highly likely to have self control problems which begin at an early age. ADHD seems to be the norm. Parents instinctively use caloric snacks as a form of medication; carbs and fat boost serotonin levels and calm the kids down. And since ADHD is seldom outgrown, based as it is on unchangeable, highly heritable aspects of brain structure and chemistry, parents are self medicating with carbs, too. It all seems so natural and comforting for the whole family to sit around eating junk food, a tableau recreated every weekend, in every urban park in California.</p>
<p>Short of the government directly dispensing dietetic meals to the poor populace and declaring Oreos and Doritos controlled substances, I think the rising tide of obesity is a natural consequence of third world people introduced to what is in effect an unlimited supply of processed foods.</p>

			<p>Of course we whites are to blame for this too.  I find it incredible that anything a minority does that it is good, they get 100% of the credit. Anything they do that is bad, and we get 100% of the blame.</p>

			<p>  There already is an obesity prevention program. It&rsquo;s called parents setting the rules of eating habits in the home. As usual, it probably does divide along ethnic/racial lines. Whites tend to be more involved in their childrens lives than do the rest of the races. There are far too many &#8220;programs&#8221; in this country soaking up the precious few tax dollars as it is in this country. We are being taxed to death already. Cradle to grave socialism is the chant of the democrats and republicans. There are way too many people in this country living on the system. Actually, there are about 50 million too many people in this country, period. Government cannot change the eating habits of any people. That has to come from the family unit. Government is not family, government is a cruel master. A cruel and unlawful master that soaks up an individuals earned income, to redistribute it amongst the ones whom threaten anarchy and violence.  </p>

			<p>Before they were assimilated to the white society, these Indians would literally starve when food ran out or game was scarce. When the band made a kill, they would engorge themselves because they knew starvation was not far away too.</p>
<p>All those craggy lean faces in the old black and white photos are from the days before they got access to white man&rsquo;s food and stability. Take those same craggy faces and blow them up like a balloon and you have your typical reservation Indian. </p>
<p>Same thing for your Scots-Irish and other Northern races who were warriors built for physical activity, hunting, fighting, building. Put us in a cubicle on a cheap fast food diet and what you get too often is a disgrace and a shame. Pudgy, pasty, weak shadows of ourselves ruined by cheap instant gratification and fenced in like farm animals. </p>

			<p>What do these mothers feed their kids?  All you hear today is eat healthy, get lots of fruits and vegetables.  Not a day goes by that you don&rsquo;t hear this on television.  What irresponsible parents. Beget and forget.</p>
