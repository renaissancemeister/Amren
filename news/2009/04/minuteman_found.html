			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Small, Arizona Capitol Times (Phoenix), April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Minuteman Project co-founder Chris Simcox is gearing up to challenge Arizona&rsquo;s senior senator next year, saying John McCain has lost touch with everyday Arizonans and has abandoned the conservative values he claims to represent.</p>
<p>Simcox has gained national notoriety for his activism on border security issues. In 2005, he and Jim Gilchrist started the Minuteman Project, which organized citizens to monitor the country&rsquo;s Southern border in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. He later split with that group and formed the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration will be one of the central themes of Simcox&rsquo;s campaign against McCain, who in 2006 spearheaded an effort to reform immigration laws that was panned by critics as &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; for illegal immigrants currently in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But top aides for Simcox&rsquo;s campaign say he is not a single-issue candidate and will show voters he is a conservative Republican on all planks of the party&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He was critical of McCain for his attempts to reform federal immigration laws, for sponsoring campaign finance laws that restrict certain donations to candidates and for his efforts to limit sales of firearms at gun shows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Simcox&rsquo;s campaign manager, Robert Kiley, said fundraising won&rsquo;t be a problem, given Simcox&rsquo;s national profile because of his work with the Minuteman Project.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simcox said during his announcement that he has already started getting donations from across the country through his Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wary of a challenge in 2010, McCain has stockpiled $3.6 million in his campaign account for 2010, as of the end of March, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. He raised $380,000 in the first quarter of the year. E-mails and calls to McCain officials were not returned.<br>

			<p>I cannot even imagine who it is that votes for John,&#8221;AMERICANS WOULDN&rsquo;T PICK LETTUCE FOR FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR&#8221; McCain. That&rsquo;s just one of the many derogatory comments towards Americans he&rsquo;s made, yet apparently it doesn&rsquo;t bother his constituents. Unreal.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t trust Simcox further than I can throw him.  Certainly McCain is traitor to this nation, in my opinion, but is Simcox mounting a campaign to keep a true patriot out of the race.  Is he &#8220;controlled opposition&#8221;?  Is he just a &#8220;place holder&#8221;?  And PS, &#8220;Immigration&#8221; is my #1 issue.  We need to close the borders, deport all Illegals, and stop legal immigration also!</p>

			<p>It would be easier for Simcox to win a state legislature seat or congressional seat. I think this may be a complete waste of time.Defeat the enemy from the lower level.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t trust Simcox.  He&rsquo;s a hustler who I think is about a few pieces of evidence discovered by the Federal prosecutors away from Federal prison, over the whole &#8220;fence&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>If Simcox can mount a serious challenge to McCain, look for McCain to make a phone call to the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office in Phoenix to get them on the ball to get Simcox in jail.  Obama did McCain a favor by sending Janet Napolitano to HLS, she/he was McCain&rsquo;s only serious obstacle to another Senate term.  So Obama&rsquo;s Federal prosecutors in Phoenix would do McCain another favor again, and it would have the extra benefit for the left of taking down a notorious right wing activist.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is he &ldquo;controlled opposition&rdquo;? Is he just a &ldquo;place holder&rdquo;?&hellip;&#8221;  <br>

<p>Probably both. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find that McCain bought Simcox, because of his mixed reputation and previous bad press, to ineffectively run against him (for promises of future covert favors or money arrangements). Simcox&rsquo;s purpose would also be to block, or split the anti-McCain vote in the event any stronger challenger entered the race. (Notice how promptly this all came about).</p>
<p>Given the deep contempt of Arizona voters for McCain&rsquo;s obnoxious protection of Mexican illegals and all the crime, drugs, and damage they continue to bring to Arizona, it&rsquo;s institutions, and it&rsquo;s quality of life, even practicing this low deceit may not be enough to save McCain from voter fury this time - Let&rsquo;s keep that hope alive. </p>
