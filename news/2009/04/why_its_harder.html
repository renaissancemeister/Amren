			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sonya Smith, Examiner, April 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the increase in cigarette tax and the cost of cigarettes officially being much more expensive, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to focus on ways to stop smoking.</p>
<p>For many, particularly African Americans who smoke menthol cigarettes, that may be a difficult task.</p>
<p>According to researchers, menthol cigarettes are harder to quit, particularly among African American and Latino smokers.</p>
<p>That is the finding of a study which examined the effects of menthol on quit rates among a diverse group of nearly 1,700 smokers attending a Tobacco Dependence Clinic at the UMDNJ-School of Public Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We previously found that menthol cigarette smokers take in more nicotine and carbon monoxide per cigarette. This study shows that menthol smokers also find it harder to quit, despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day,&#8221; said study author Kunal Gandhi, MBBS, MPH, a researcher in the division of addiction psychiatry at the UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Foulds [Jonathan Foulds, director of the Tobacco Dependence Program], &#8220;More than 80 percent of the African American smokers attending our clinic smoke menthols, and they have half the quit rate of African Americans who smoke non-menthol cigarettes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers believe the cooling effect of the menthol makes it easier to inhale more nicotine from each cigarette and, therefore, to obtain a stronger and more addictive nicotine dose. &#8220;That may be part of the reason why African Americans have much higher rates of lung cancer,&#8221; Foulds said.</p>
<p>The researchers also are concerned that more young and Latino smokers are becoming addicted to menthol cigarettes. The tobacco industry may target its marketing of menthol cigarettes to groups with less cash to spend, such as youths, with the aim of getting them hooked even on fewer cigarettes per day, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advertising and promotion of tobacco products is prevalent in Black communities in California, advocates complained. Throughout the years, Blacks have been exposed to hundreds of tobacco ads, most of which are for menthol cigarettes, they said. Historically, the tobacco industry places proportionately more menthol cigarette ads in Black-oriented magazines than general population magazines, they charged.</p>

			<p>Applying Occam&rsquo;s Razor to the question, it would seem that people with a deficit of self-discipline and impulse control, to say nothing lower average intelligence, will have greater difficulty achieving any goal, be it quitting smoking, losing weight, completing school, or holding a job.</p>
<p>One wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that this would require a heavily-funded study to figure out.</p>
<p>And they still got the wrong answer!</p>

			<p>This is nonsense.  I smoked menthols for over 30 years and decided 9 years ago I had enough.  I was able to quit the smoking habit cold turkey and haven&rsquo;t had a smoke in almost 9 years. </p>

			<p>Hold on, it seems that this article is admitting that Blacks are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes. I&rsquo;m outraged. Next, they&rsquo;re going be saying blacks like fried chicken. Off all the racist garbage in the media&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Everything is harder for blacks. This is because of lower I.Q.&rsquo;s, poor impulse controls and their tremendous desire for immediate gratification.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The effects of menthol make it easier to inhale more nicotine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly correct.  The menthol is included as a sort of inhalational throat losenge, so one can smoke far more without the throat feeling like raw hamburger.  Clove cigarettes work the same way.  Cloves contain eugenol, which is a topical anasthetic that allow smokers to comfortably more of the harsh Indonesian tobacco than they otherwise could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advertising and promotion of tobacco products is prevalent in black communities in California.&#8221;</p>
<p>A disingenuous half-truth.  This advertising is prevalent in all communities.  The tobacco companies are targeting everyone they can, and not merely a minority group notorious for low IQ, lack of education, and poor self-control.  Your money and my money is just as green as money spent by blacks; tobacco companies want ours too, if they can get it.</p>

<p>Uh-huh.  As usual, black failure (and apparently now mestizo failure as well) is all Whitey&rsquo;s fault. Nothing new here, folks.</p>

			<p>I am a white guy with a unique take on this question. I smoked Camels for 18 years and quit for 15 years. Then I smoked Kools for a dozen years and quit again. Menthol cigarettes are no tougher to quit than non-menthol. Period. Any difference in quit rates are a factor of the smoker, not the smoked. The researchers should have compared economic class with quitting rates. Bet you a dollar to a donut that those in the lower economic ranks had lousier rates than others. Class will tell.</p>

			<p>I wonder if we will be treated to a more useful study investigating whether education and IQ have any correlation with tobacco quitting rates, or whether they have any correlation with how susceptable people are to advertising pitches.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>

			<p>I smoked for years. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to start, but it takes a hell of a lot of will power to quit. </p>
