<h1>America&rsquo;s Most Dangerous Cities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zack O&rsquo;Malley Greenburg, Forbes, April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Motor City, [the former mayor, Kwame] Kilpatrick, 38, is just one ripple in the area&rsquo;s sea of crime. Detroit is the worst offender on our list of America&rsquo;s most dangerous cities, thanks to a staggering rate of 1,220 violent crimes committed per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit was followed closely on the list by the greater Memphis, Tenn., and Miami, Fla., metropolitan areas. Those three were the only large cities in America with more than 950 violent crimes committed per 100,000 people.</p>
<p><b>Behind the Numbers</b></p>
<p>To determine our list, we used violent crime statistics from the FBI&rsquo;s latest uniform crime report, issued in 2008. The violent crime category is composed of four offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. We evaluated U.S. metropolitan statistical areas  &mdash;  geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for use by federal agencies in collecting, tabulating and publishing federal statistics  &mdash;  with more than 500,000 residents.</p>
<p>Though nationwide crime was down 3.5% year over year in the first six months of 2008, the cities atop our list illustrate a disturbing trend: All 10 of the most dangerous cities were among those identified by the Department of Justice as transit points for Mexican drug cartels.</p>
<p>Run by crime lords like Joaquin Guzman Lorea, these gangs  &mdash;  and their violent turf wars  &mdash;  are spreading into the American Southwest and beyond. Places like Stockton, Calif., nearly 500 miles from Tijuana, have seen an uptick in related violent crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stockton is a major transit point along the I-5 corridor on the way to Seattle and Vancouver,&#8221; says Wolfram. &#8220;A lot of it is similar to crime happening in the Southwest. For the most part, it&rsquo;s drug gang on drug gang.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Motown Blues</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit isn&rsquo;t the only city on the list that&rsquo;s suffering from abandonment issues.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, Nev., for example, the housing boom created loads of excess inventory. When the market tanked, homeowners suddenly found themselves with properties worth far less than the mortgages they&rsquo;d taken out. In the worst cases, banks foreclosed, leaving people without homes  &mdash;  and with more debt than they&rsquo;d had to begin with. As a result, Sin City is even emptier than Detroit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Few Signs of Improvement</b></p>
<p>Making matters more difficult, as municipal budgets shrink during this recession, crime-fighting funds are often among the first casualties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>There is another outfit that does these kinds of surveys, and they release their list of most dangerous cities in the fall of every year.  And usually, St. Louis is at or near the top.</p>
<p>The current mayor of St. Louis complains that the study&rsquo;s methodology is flawed because it only measures incorporated cities and not entire metropolitan areas.  Except that he is the mayor of an incorporated city only and not a metropolitan area.</p>
<p>This study does measure metro areas, and St. Louis isn&rsquo;t in the top 15.  </p>

			<p>Other than Las Vegas, all of these cities are predominantly minority populated.  This site is a good tool for checking demographics;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a victim report in Vegas to see what race most of the perpretrators were.  I&rsquo;ll bet they were &#8220;White&#8221; but had a last name of Lopez or Rodriguez.</p>

			<p>I am a native Detroiter&hellip;lived in the inner city, then the suburbs.  (I now live near Amish country in Ohio.)  I heard that even back in the 70s school principals were behind bullet-proof glass in Detroit.</p>
<p>I still have family in that area.  My mother says that things are so bad there now, people are scavenging houses for copper and whatever else to sell.</p>
<p>Whenever my dad went to Detroit for anything, he was packing heat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame what happened to Detroit.  My dad grew up there in the 1940s and he told me it was a nice place back then.  They used to show movies in the park, and you could sleep in the park and no one would bother you.  You hardly ever had to lock your house.  The city of Highland Park (bordered by Hamtramck on one side and surrounded by Detroit) was a high-class neighborhood back then.</p>
<p>There is a vacant lot on Trumbull where our old apartment house once stood&hellip;it burned down sometime in the early 80s, after we&rsquo;d moved to the suburbs.  My dad also told me that if you&rsquo;re driving through Detroit, and there are kids out playing in the road, do not stop at any stop signs or you&rsquo;re likely to get carjacked.</p>

			<p>Detroit is 81.5% black and 5% Latino and 1% Asian. Call it 88% non-white. </p>
<p>Memphis is 61% black, 3% Latino and 
<p>Miami is 22% black, and 65% Latino. Call it 87% non-white.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is 10% black and  24% Latino and 5% Asian.  Call it 39% non-white. </p>
<p>Stockton is 11% black, 1% Native American, 20% Asian and 17.3% other races, and 32% Latino.  Call it 81% non-white. </p>
<p>All statistics from 2000 Census as reported on internet. </p>
<p>4 of the top 5 cities are massively non-white, the only exception is Las Vegas.   </p>
<p>One point about Las Vegas, it was the fastest growing city for most of the decade and probably has very different demographics today than 9 years ago when the stats were created. </p>
<p>To avoid living in a high-crime city avoid living in a city full of non-whites.  These cities are uniquely minority-laden, without exception.  And they are crime meccas.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look for Forbes to point out this obvious connection. </p></p>

			<p>Actually, it isn&rsquo;t really necessary to compile stats on any city to know which are most damgerous and have the worst environments.  Just pop up the demographs of every city and determine the number of blacks and mestizos, but especially blacks.</p>
<p>Then avoid those areas.</p>

			<p>One would find, assuming that one would risk being designated by the infamous &#8220;R&#8221; word, that there is a direct correlation between the percentage of black and brown residents as compared to whites and the number of violent crimes being committed per one hundred thousand residents? </p>
<p>One would suspect that with the greater the number of blacks and browns comes the greater the number of violent crimes? Of course this study would never be done? Oh really? Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t need to be done since the average white person is not nearly as abysmally ignorant as the white shoe boys from Yale and Harvard would have you believe. When a white man loses his job, his future, his home, his car, his retirement, his marriage, his family, and is on the street cold and hungry, he probably will no longer fully appreciate being told &#8220;yes we can&#8221; by a Gentleman de Colour government employee driving by in his big Mercedes.        </p>
<p>When this country enters into the next depression [which it will in about a year], you will be noticing that all of this liberal propaganda supporting racial toleration will be collapsing faster than the stock market   &mdash;   and no   &mdash;   the Market didn&rsquo;t hit its low on March 6th   &mdash;   it will go lower   &mdash;   a whole lot lower!     </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep drinking the Clinton-Bush-Opera-Obama production  Kool Aide - it&rsquo;s not good for your health! The economy is not going to be turning around - its global. Its fatal! With approximately 600 trillion dollars in debt over credit swap derivatives [whatever  the hell that is] all the bailouts in the world ain&rsquo;t gonna be helping! You can&rsquo;t buy your way out of debt by printing a lot of worthless money. Moreover, I get real nervous when people that I know must have I.Q.&rsquo;s at least thirty points lower than mine are somehow being expected to get us out of this mess, especially since  they are the same people who have gotten us into it!     </p>
<p>These cities are going to be engaged in racial warfare, crime will be rampant, and the whites that could get out are busy getting out&hellip;NOW!</p>
<p>So you think New Orleans - post Katrina was bad?  Trust me, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet!!!  </p>

			<p>Guess what, my fellow White brothers and Sisters?  I happen to live in Stockton, California.  And yes, there are fewer and fewer Whites.  The dearth of Whites in most -if not all- of the public schools is amazing&hellip;.. Just a portent of what&rsquo;s to come&hellip;.. Let&rsquo;s put it this way, one of the PC editors of the local rag berated those who wanted to name another school after an Anglo White historical figure. <br>
It will be true justice when the readership of the Record (the name of the paper) plummets because of the decreasing numbers of White Anglo people.  They don&rsquo;t understand that readers must have a pro-literate cultural value.  Literacy just doesn&rsquo;t come out of a vacuum!!!!</p>

			<p>This is a shocking report. It&rsquo;s stunning to hear that certain hate groups still cling to the notion (and their Bibles and guns) that blacks and Hispanics commit felonies at many times the rate of whites.</p>
<p>These pernicious lies have to stop.  Indeed, those guilty of propagating these outrageous falsehoods should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>

			<p> i also live in vegas and the town is getting scary. You cannot stop near a plant nursery or HOME Depot without your car being bum rushed by Mexican day workers.  The violence is getting worse, just this weekend a 70 year old was beaten and died. The town isnt safe and my wife and I are looking to move out when I retire</p>

			<p>The more things change the more they stay the same. I remember seeing a list of highest crime metros in 1987 and Detroit and Miami were at the top. </p>
<p>Las Vegas has also consistently had a high crime rate, the highest of any city without a large black population. Lot&rsquo;s of rough transient types there.   </p>

			<p>The single most likely factor to explain the amount and severity of crime is the number of blacks - the more blacks the more crime. This is true all over the world by the way, not just the United States. A very detailed study of crime was done in California some years ago. All of the state&rsquo;s counties were analyzed and compared. Every possible variable was fed into the study. The results all showed the same thing. The more blacks in the county, the more crime. And of course, the reverse also held true. The correlation factor was .70. In other words 70% of the difference in crime in any given two areas can be explained by the difference in the size of its black population.</p>

			<p>Detroit has a vast majority of blacks. What about the other cities? Moreover, what is the high sshool dropout rate in these places? Stop pretending everyone is capable of college. Stop giving a one size fits all class to everyone regardless of grades and aptitude. By the end of ninth grade, the dirty secret is that most teachers can tell you who will go to college, who won&rsquo;t, whose headed for trouble,and who will dropout. The Liberal educators who run most school systems, includineg all of the black/spanish majority schools, live in a dream world that deqwan can go to college if he&rsquo;s only given a chance to do hands on work and discover truth for himself, without lectures from teacherss(which he&rsquo;s too ADD to listen to). We need more vocational and manual skills classes. It will save some of these kids. The others will become criminals no matter what you do. The NAACP however will oppose vocational classes if they are majority black or hispanic, regardless of low verbal and math scores by minority students. These scores stay low all through high school no matter how many times you let these pathetic excuses for young men and women take the academic type tests.</p>
<p>A few will respond to hands on training-even farming and landscaping. Give those few a chance, and publicize the success. The rest? Work camps, surveillance, special ID cards and financial incentives to return to Africa, El Salvador, etc.</p>

			<p>What are white people suppose to do about sending their kids to school in large cities?</p>
<p>* Public schools are getting worse by the year.</p>
<p>* Private schools are quickly becoming too expensive for the average family.</p>
<p>* Try and have a white public school. Non-whites will be lined up outside the door demanding to get admitted. </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t Newtom Ma. the home of all those harvard profs and other vicious whtie hating intellectuals like Alan Derschowitz who destroyed entire cities with their insane ideas about school busing, housing projects, affirmative action morons running the civil service and allowing black criminals to rampage on the grounds of &#8220;social justice?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see huge all black projects built in places like Newton.  Let the rich liberals live in the horror they created for us proletarians.  Then give Newton an all black female police force, school system and civil service, including the gas, water, electric, telephone and garbage collection.</p>

<p>These same non-whites commit a lot of crime, and also defend criminals and those who have stepped, however fleetingly, on the wrong side of the law.</p>
<p>Is there a connection between these two facts?</p>
<p>Just why is it they want to be so near white folks?</p>

			<p>To Margaret:</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz lives in Cambridge, MA, which is more actively (and notoriously) liberal than Newton:  &#8220;People&rsquo;s Republic of Cambridge&#8221;.  Dershowitz is not left-wing across the board by any means.  He also is very strongly pro-Jewish, and simultaneously is supportive of non-Jewish (e.g. Catholic) Eastern European peoples and cultures.  Read his books!  Start with his well-written works of fiction, particularly &#8220;Just Revenge&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know specifically how Dershowitz stood on the Boston school-busing issue but strongly suspect he is not generally in favor of busing, as he respects the right of people to be loyal to their own ethnic groups and cultures and not have those cultures interfered with, except where rights (e.g. right to life) are violated. </p>
<p>Newton MA already has had contact with inner-city black culture, via the METCO program that allowed city blacks to attend wealthy suburban public schools.  Also, I&rsquo;m not sure how old Kenn&rsquo;s data is, but Newton surely has a much bigger % of South Asians than the 0.9% he claims  &mdash;  Harvard, MIT, and the sci-tech companies around here are full of wealthy South Asians.  In any case, though, Newton is probably quite academic-liberal overall.  So are the other wealthy Boston suburbs, particularly Lexington (same Lexington of 1775 Minuteman fame). </p>
<p>The fact that a lot of these wealthy people either are entrepreneurs or have close contact with entrepreneurs puts a lid on how far left they are willing to go.</p>
