			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed West, Telegraph (London), April 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the most disturbing aspects of the culture war against Christianity is that the authorities are turning us into a nation of sneaks and Judases.</p>
<p>Every month there is some new story about a Baptist nurse or Evangelical preacher who gets in trouble for mentioning the G-word, and each time it&rsquo;s because some weasel has informed on them.</p>
<p>The latest case involves David Booker, a 44-year-old who works for the English Churches Housing Group, a homeless charity run by Anglicans and Baptists. On March 26 Booker was working the evening shift, and fell into a conversation with a colleague, Fiona Vardy, about religion  &mdash;  as you do, it is a religious charity, after all. Asked his views on homosexuality, Mr Booker said he agreed with the Church&rsquo;s teaching on homosexuality and same-sex marriages. He explained he had gay friends and that he was not homophobic.</p>
<p>The following day Booker was summoned by his boss and suspended for &#8220;events that happened last night&#8221; and three days later formerly suspended, and threatened with &#8220;gross misconduct&#8221; for breaking the charity&rsquo;s Culture and Diversity Code of Conduct. The rap sheet says states:</p>
<p>&#8220;On 26 March 09, whilst on shift with Fiona Vardy, you seriously breached ECHG&rsquo;s (English churches House group) Code of conduct by promoting your religious views which contained discriminatory comments regarding a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange that the people who always bang on about &#8220;diversity&#8221; can&rsquo;t stand the most important diversity of all  &mdash;  diversity of opinion.</p>
<p>What disturbs me most is not just how intolerant they are of people&rsquo;s freedom of belief and opinion (obviously there have to be limits, but Mr Booker&rsquo;s were well within a reasonable spectrum) but how we are being turned into a nation of informers. People should be ashamed of themselves for reporting private conversations  &mdash;  if you object to a colleague&rsquo;s religious or political views, tell them or keep quiet, don&rsquo;t go running off to your bosses.</p>
<p>Historians often debate whether had we lost in 1940, Britons would have acted like the Germans under the Nazis. Well, I know we would have no trouble behaving like the East Germans under the Communists, informing on our colleagues for holding views contrary to the state&rsquo;s official opinion. We&rsquo;re already a nation of sneaks ruled by a passive-aggressive diversity Stasi.<br>

<p>All very true. But what the Torygraph doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand is that the ONLY party serious about combating this Stasi-like PC climate or reducing Third World immigration is NOT their beloved Conservatives, but the British National Party. Yet the Torygraph   &mdash;   like EVERY newspaper in UK   &mdash;   remains committed (thanks to the National Union of Journalists) to mentioning the BNP only negatively or not at all. When writing an article like this, the BNP would be the logical people for the author to approach for a quote; needless to say they&rsquo;re nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>(But I&rsquo;m guessing the UK media will be forced to drop their conspiracy of silence against the BNP after the results are in from the June 4 EUro elections. After that, the BNP may become both unstoppable and unignorable.) </p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re perilously close to the UK ourselves.  While it may not get you arrested, fined, or imprisoned for announcing that, say, you don&rsquo;t approve of homosexual activity, it can get you sued for turning your workplace into a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221; for some aggrieved whomever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite astonishing how, in less than two decades, homosexuals went from being generally avoided by straights to enjoying a privileged status.  And this for the people who brought us the greatest (in terms of cost) public health hazard in history, plus a large increase in all other STDs.</p>

			<p>There was a great German movie a few years ago, about a secret policeman who protected a writer.  Most interesting to me was the portrayal of how the regime kept people in line.  No longer did they send you to the camps, as a rule, but they withheld your privileges.  &#8220;Tell anyone what you saw and your daughter will never be accepted at a university.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s the way it will soon be in Occupied America.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s already how it is. The leftists generate controversy, they get your name in the news, and then when future employers, schools or friends Google you, they get to see all the slander.</p>
<p>Leftists know this and it&rsquo;s why they try to &#8220;out&#8221; anti-diversity activists.</p>

<p>Indeed, the entire West (not just the UK) has become a &ldquo;Disneyland&rdquo; of happy-go-lucky multicultural Marxism. One dare not question the questionable; or worse, call the idiotic what it is, idiocy. The amusingly ironic aspect to all of this, is the fact that particularly in countries such as: the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc., we are approaching a Weimar period where &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is fast becoming an anachronism at best. The real choice is not about higher political and philosophical ideals, or even bread and butter issues; the real choice is between multicultural phantasms and racial/nationalistic lucidity. </p>
<p>That is the choice; if you live in the UK, you are lucky as you have the BNP to act as a guide here.</p>
<p>In the USA, we just have Obama and the GOP!</p>
<p>God help us all in the USA!!!</p>

<p>The bigger problem is they can&rsquo;t stand white diversity. Whether it is the nice neighborhood in the suburbs or the worst neighborhood in the inner-city, both are obsessed with reducing the number of whites. In African, China and most of Europe it&rsquo;s the same. </p>

<p>They hate us because they know we possess qualities that they don&rsquo;t and we are vulnerable right now. The Chinese know it.  They&rsquo;re emigrating here and setting up shop for takeover.  Blacks hate Whites out of pure envy I believe.  They want what they perceive that we have and so do the Hispanics.  All you have to do is extrapolate on currents trends and you can see that our time is running out - unless &hellip;</p>

			<p>Posted by Anonymous at 6:21 PM is completely correct in the comment about the British National Party. But for that they suffer the price of labelling by the communist rulers of the country. After WWII with Stalin still friend to the west, the communists wormed their way deep into European and British society. Today, 60 years later in Britain it is no secret the the communists control the governing Labour Party, the Unions and the Church of England.</p>
<p>To communists, communism is their religion. In their minds, there shall be no other god period! The Muslims in Britain openly state that Britain will be an Islamic country in the west within 20 years. The ruling communists have made it legally impossible to challenge them with threat of prison. What the Muslims don&rsquo;t realise is that the communists are only using them to diversify the country and will smash their religion once the Christians have been broken up as they have almost been now.</p>

<p> The movie in question was The Lives of Others (German: Das Leben der Anderen.) Yes, you don&rsquo;t need to be sent to a camp these days; just threatened with a loss of livelihood and respectability.</p>

			<p>KC is right.  Communism is a recurring social disease in the West, rooted in some peculiarity in our culture.  I suppose that in the middle ages, it expressed itself through some of the many heresies.  Today, it expresses itself as multiculturalism.  Your typical liberal is about as willing to mingle with his brown brothers as the typical Red Commissar was willing to live in poverty.  Heresy (some), Communism, multiculturalism, are all the same social virus popping up over centuries, a hatred of the normal and healthy, coupled to a desire to destroy what they cannot have.   Why, after all, would leftists want to drive down the wages of the American working class?  Why would &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; care nothing about hordes of Hispanics flooding into the country?  The causes they embrace don&rsquo;t really mean much, since they are so willing to undermine them.  What matters is their hatred, any reason to bash healthy normal people going about their lives will do.  The bearers of this disease need to be identified and quarantined.  <br>
     Back in the 1930s, the British Communist Party ordered some of its student members to enter the Anglican clergy, work for the Party&rsquo;s interests, and await further orders.  I&rsquo;m sure that all western Red Parties did the same, placing their young bright devotees into all sorts of institutions.  That&rsquo;s what anti-Communist &#8220;witch hunts&#8221; were about, digging up the moles.  Today, the moles run the place openly.  There&rsquo;ll be no need for witch hunts in the future, they&rsquo;re all running around wearing pointed hats and riding on brooms.  </p>

			<p>This is Political Correctness, and Political Correctness is a religion (faith) based on the evasion of physical reality.  Therefore it is no more legitimate than anyother in a supposed secular regime.  For example; Has anyone proved human equality, anyone seen any evidence?</p>

			<p><em>What the Muslims don&rsquo;t realise is that the communists are only using them to diversify the country and will smash their religion once the Christians have been broken up as they have almost been now.</em></p>
<p>I beg to differ, but the last time that the revolutionary socialists tried to manipulate the muslisms (1979 - Iranian Revolution), they lost quite sorely. The self-styled agents of change were rather well defeated in that <em>contra temps</em> and yet they still seem to have learend lessons.</p>
<p>The arrogant and conceited elements think that they can control and continue to manipulate the grievance groups; but in the final analysis, I suspect that this will prove to be too much for them.</p>
<p>Race/Religion has replaced Class as the principal mechanism of animus for those who would manipulate all of us; however, I suspect that the self-appointed arch-manipulators are in for a rude awakening when the supposed puppets refuse to conform to type.</p>

<p>Political Correctness is more about just being anti-white. Non-whites will behave in a way that, objectively, is offensive to whites, yet the attention of being offensive or not will be placed on the white person. Is anything, ever, offensive to white people? People use the tern red-neck, a racial slur, in an effort to prove to everyone how enlightened they are. In court, the families of white victims murdered by blacks will have to claim they&rsquo;re not racist. </p>
