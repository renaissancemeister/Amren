<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six-in-ten Hispanic adults living in the United States who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents lack health insurance, according to a new analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center of a survey it conducted in 2007. The nationwide survey offers a detailed look at the health insurance and health care access of an immigrant subgroup that has become a focus of attention in the current debate over health care reform.</p>
<p>The share of uninsured among this group (60%) is much higher than the share of uninsured among Latino adults who are legal permanent residents or citizens (28%), or among the adult population of the United States (17%).</p>
<p>Hispanic adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents tend to be younger and healthier than the adult U.S. population and are less likely than other groups to have a regular health care provider. {snip}</p>
<p>Overall, four-in-ten (41%) non-citizen, non-legal permanent resident Hispanics state that their usual provider is a community clinic or health center. These centers are designed primarily as &#8220;safety nets&#8221; for vulnerable populations and are funded by a variety of sources, including the federal government, state governments and private foundations, as well as reimbursements from patients, based upon a sliding scale (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008).</p>
<p>Some 15% of Latino adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents report that they use private doctors, hospital outpatient facilities or health maintenance organizations when they are sick or need advice about their health. {snip}</p>
<p>An additional 6% of Latino adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents report that they usually go to an emergency room when they are sick or need advice about their health. {snip}</p>
<p>Some 37% of Latino adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents have no usual health care provider. {snip} However, a majority (56%) say they do not have a usual provider because they simply do not need one. An additional 5% state that difficulty in navigating the U.S. health care system prevents them from having a usual provider.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, about one-quarter of all adult Latinos are undocumented. Pew Hispanic Center analyses of Current Population {snip}</p>
<p><b>Health Status</b></p>
<p>The Latino population in the U.S. is relatively young, and Latino adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents are younger still. Some 43% of adult Latinos who are not citizens or legal permanent residents are younger than age 30, compared with 27% of Hispanic adults who are citizens or legal permanent residents and 22% of the adult U.S. population. The youthfulness of this population contributes to its relative healthiness. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Experiences in the Health Care System</b></p>
<p>Three-fourths (76%) of Latino adults who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents report that the quality of medical care they received in the past year was excellent or good. This is similar to the proportion of adult Latino citizens and legal permanent residents (78%) who express satisfaction with their recent health care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among those Latinos who are neither citizens nor legal permanent residents who report receiving poor medical treatment in the past five years, a plurality (46%) state that they believed their accent or the way they spoke English contributed to that poor care. {snip}</p>

		<p>Illegal aliens in California are doing just fine with health care  &mdash;  as long as one emergency room remains open to them. I recently drove my older Aunt, to an emergency room, because she was in pain due to a recent medical procedure. The place was not far from her house. When we arrived, it was full of what no doubt were illegal aliens, and so help me I&rsquo;m not kidding, two beds were occupied by drunks, that were sobering up. I knew they were drunks because the cops came and arrested and handcuffed  them after awhile. They had deprived actual sick people of those two beds for a couple of hours. </p>

		<p>There is a difference between health insurance and health care. Hispanics maybe be lacking in health insurance, but by the looks of the emergency rooms, they are not lacking in health care.</p>
<p>Besides if you have free health care at the emergency room, why spend money on health insurance? </p>

		<p>Can somebody explain to me how anybody can determine how many illegals don&rsquo;t have health insurance when nobody knows how many illegals there are in the US?  The figure is estimated from 12 to 20 million.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to get even a ball park figure on uninsured aliens, and 60% sounds waaaay too high.  I mean, how was the survey taken?  &#8220;Excuse me.  Are you an illegal alien, and if so, do you have health insurance?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I took my husband to the emergency room last year and it looked like I was exiting the airport in Mexico City or something. Almost every taken seat had an Hispanic person sitting in it. </p>
<p>We sat. And sat. And sat. My husband, who was having trouble breathing (turned out to be blood clot in lung) was in agony. Finally, I started yelling that we had insurance and that I wanted my husband seen immediately. It was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Well, duh, if you can&rsquo;t communicate clearly, how are you going to tell the doctor or nurse what is wrong with you?  On the other hand, maybe it was that cry of &#8220;undocumented&#8221;, made to get out of paying the bill, that had something to do with the poor care?</p>
<p>I just love how they dance around using the term &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221;, much less &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221;.  The new term is now &#8220;neither citizens nor legal permanent residents&#8221;.</p>

		<p>And do you know what they do when they have insurance?  They get into auto collisions and work injuries, and get a settlement.  I KNOW this because I was an involved witness in California for years, although I did not participate in fraud myself, and when I did, I quit the clinic once I discovered it.  I quit my last job at a clinic when I discovered that illegals were being smuggled into the area, told to get a job and get hurt and the clinic would make it so that they would get a disability check for rest of their lives.  In another case earlier in my own practice a Laotian man who had acted as interpreter in a few cases I had handled, approached me with an offer to bring me cases for a fee - an extremely illegal practice.  I refused and soon found that a colleague less than a mile away was doing business with him.  I eventually had my office broke into and ransacked, after I broke up a gang of Hispanic girls beating up on one girl behind my office.  This is a side of so-called health care delivery that hardly ever sees the light of day.  It is comepletely corrupt and is fired on by lawyers who prosecute every case they can turn up.  </p>
<p>I went out of business, went and worked in Europe in a socialized medicine situation.  Now, I wish I had never come back, because I found myself working in the situation I first mentioned.  Now, I am unemployed and barely hanging onto my home.  But I would rather suffer as I am now, than be involved in something that is not only corrupt and illegal, but supports the invasions and usurpation of my country.  However, I must say that in any fair system, I would be working and not seeing my knowledge and talents wasted, as well as my own life dwindling as this brave new America reminds me daily that I am some sort of &#8220;dinosaur,&#8221; white man, who needs to be replaced by all these new, wonderful people.</p>

<p>Sorry,  but you are dead wrong.  The number of Americans without insurance is calculated minus the estimated number of illegals.  YOu can find this out by checking several government sites as well as private ones.  But anyone who would make such a wild statement as if they have some secret information no one else has will no doubt dismiss all sources.  </p>
<p>Even then, the math doesn&rsquo;t works unless the number of illegals in this country is almost one third of the total population.  Beyond that, another third to 50% of Americans are under-insured or have policies that regularly deny claims or cut them off when there is a serious illness or disease.  This is not to mention denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Many posters here make me think that they must be young, employed and somehow retain a good job with great benefits without the benefit of a college or advanced education.  Come on, get a grip, as whites we have serious problems to deal with and it is counter productive to continue to fabricate misinformation thinking it will somehow aid us.  We have enough truth and right to exist in our country without this sort of nonsense.</p>

		<p>Same here. When I picked up my sister at the emergency room, all I had to do was spot the redhead in a sea of Mexicans. We live in Texas. It used to be if you had to go to the emergency room, the wait was like 10 minutes, now it&rsquo;s like hours.</p>
<p>PS-To the lady whose husband had a blood clot in the lung, that is very serious and can kill one. He should have been seen immediately but no, a Mexican had a cold, must take care of them first. Ridiculous!</p>

		<p>An emergency room in California is like low tide at the pier.  Full of washed up and drunk Mexicans.(I find this odd because a lot of Mexicans avoid the medical system from what I&rsquo;ve seen.  All that religous and superstitious mumbo jumbo and whatnot)  An emergency room in New York is more or less Central Booking.  Full of drugged up Blacks in handcuffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but you are dead wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, while I agree that nobody knows the exact figures, there are a huge amount of uninsured as well as those here legally but are not citizens, that don&rsquo;t have insurance. If one were to take away the foreigners, the rate of uninsured would drop dramatically. Also, take away those uninsured Americans who are wealthy and don&rsquo;t need it and it would drop further. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we wouldn&rsquo;t  have a healthcare problem as that would still leave a certain percentage of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured but it would make the problem much more manageable, that is insuring those who fall between the cracks instead instead of spending large amounts on foreigners. My state, Texas, spent 5 billion alone just on non-citizens and our local hospital spent 375 million on them. Imagine if we used this for uninsured Texans instead or to fund low cost healthcare clinics for them???<br>

<p>Better check your facts, Whiteplight.  Illegals are counted in the 40 plus million supposedly without health insurance.  Every pundit on radio and t.v. makes reference to the fact that illegals are counted in the uninsured figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;YOu can find this out by checking several government sites as well as private ones. But anyone who would make such a wild statement as if they have some secret information no one else has will no doubt dismiss all sources.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Checking government sites?  Well, what are they?  Or will any government site do?  You contested a point.  Where&rsquo;s your back up information?  How can anybody &#8220;dismiss all sources,&#8221; when you don&rsquo;t give any?  What in God&rsquo;s name are you trying to say?</p>
<p>&#8220;Many posters here make me think that they must be young, employed and somehow retain a good job with great benefits without the benefit of a college or advanced education.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense.   However, there are those whose posts are often gratuitously insulting and are uncalled for, to say nothing of unclear and semi-illiterate, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed for exactly those reasons, but somehow they get posted.</p>
<p>The above condemnations are not only pointless insults, but they&rsquo;re borderline illiterate, regarding content.</p>

<p>While your American friends end up bailing out those hospitals driven to near-bankruptcy with their tax dollars. Any questions?</p>
