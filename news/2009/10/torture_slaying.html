<h1>Torture Slaying Trial: Video Used Against Defense</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, October 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Defenders of the alleged ringleader in the torture slayings of a Knox County couple faced their biggest hurdle Thursday  &mdash;  their client&rsquo;s own mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she over there to buy dope?&#8221; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agent Forest &#8220;Woody&#8221; Webb asked Lemaricus Davidson about slaying victim Channon Christian in a police video shown to jurors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&rsquo;t never seen the girl before in my life,&#8221; Davidson answered during the interrogation shortly after his Jan. 11, 2007, arrest.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys David Eldridge and Doug Trant have been trying this week to sow seeds of doubt about whether Christian, 21, and her boyfriend, Christopher Newsom, 23, were victims of a carjacking turned kidnapping, rape and murder by suggesting the couple went to Davidson&rsquo;s Chipman Street neighborhood in search of drugs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Thursday, prosecutors Leland Price and Takisha Fitzgerald fired back with Davidson&rsquo;s own statement, which contains contradictions to his current claims and changing accounts of what he knew and did in the weekend the couple met a horrific end.</p>
<p>Davidson first told Webb and Knoxville Police Department Investigator Ryan Flores that he was nothing more than a drug dealer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling dope, that&rsquo;s what I do, sell dope,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t kill people though.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He insisted he never saw Christian and Newsom in the vehicle or in his house. That account changed, however, when he learned that Cobbins and Thomas had been nabbed in Kentucky. Flores hinted they were telling tales about Davidson.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had both of them in the backseat tied up,&#8221; Davidson said. &#8220;I know the girl was at my house. I know that (Thomas) killed the dude.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When that girl was in my house, I wasn&rsquo;t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davidson didn&rsquo;t stick with that story long, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stayed there like five minutes (after Christian was brought into his house),&#8221; Davidson said. &#8220;I bumped up against her a couple of times, but that&rsquo;s the only contact I had.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She grabbed me though. She touched my arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davidson said Christian told him, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to die.&#8221; He said he assured her that she wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Every time I read another account of this horrific crime, this latest and perhaps foulest of naked anti-White crimes of race hatred by blacks, I can only seethe with impotent fury.</p>
<p>Impotent fury at the very nature of the crime and the people who committed them; and also impotent fury at the blind fools who will not see this ugly tragedy for what it was.</p>

In the first trial, Knoxville Horror carjacker-kidnapper-rapist-torturer-murderer Letalvis Cobbins was spared proper punishment by a jury which was comprised of six (originally seven) blacks, five (originally four) whites, and one Asian. Now, the predominantly white taxpayers, including the families of his victims, Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, will have to pay for Cobbins&rsquo; three hots and a cot, Cable TV, weight lifting, etc. in prison, where he will no doubt be lionized by his fellow racist black felons.<br>
Cobbins was officially sentenced to &ldquo;life without parole. The jury&rsquo;s pretext for not sentencing Cobbins to death for the most heinous crimes ever committed in Knox County was a transparently ridiculous set of what it called &ldquo;mitigating&rdquo; factors, which it asserted outweighed any aggravating factors: &ldquo;a horrific childhood, the pleas of his relatives and his alleged role as subordinate to an evil mastermind.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Shortly after midnight on January 7, the most controversial crime of the year was committed in Knoxville, Tennessee. A young white couple &mdash; Channon Gail Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom Jr., 23 &mdash; were carjacked, kidnapped, gang-raped (both of them), tortured and murdered. Five suspects, all black, were in custody.<br>
The media blackout of the Channon Christian/Christopher Newsom murder case was almost complete. The young white couple was brutally murdered allegedly by five blacks back in January. Lack of news coverage led to accusations that media outlets were ignoring the story because the defendants were black and the victims white. That was clearly the case and the MSM NEVER reported on these crimes.<br>

		<p>An email I wrote a friend:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the father of the murdered girl sits in court and rocks&hellip;with a look on his face of barely controlled rage and hate. Day after day. As the defense attorneys try to imply that it was all a drug deal gone bad and that she had consensual sex with the murderer. He&rsquo;s in terrible shape&hellip;very disturbing to many of us. He&rsquo;s as much as said that these defendants are going to die, one way or the other. Said he made a vow to his daughter.</p>
<p>The judge is a very decent and able, informally authoritative old Southern gentleman. Once when the jury was out he worked out something with all the lawyers about some point that had come up, and when he asked them, &#8220;Is that okay with everyone?&#8221;, the girl&rsquo;s father blurted out, &#8220;NO!&#8221; The judge just said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not asking you,&#8221; and continued on.</p>
<p>Everything about this case is disturbing.</p>
<p>These parents have been to about 70 different court hearings besides the trials&hellip;motions, etc. for two years&hellip;all they have so far is one 18 year carjacking sentence and one life without parole. It&rsquo;s like a torture for them that will never end, with 2 or 3 more trials coming after the current one, and if any defendant does get a death sentence, it will literally go on forever.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This trial and the way it&rsquo;s being handled and the lack of media coverage goes to show what is wrong with living in a multi-racial society. It also shows that those in charge fully understand what an explosive situation this could be. </p>
<p>If both the defendants and the victoms were of the same race there would be no reason for a media black out.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s so dangerous just to go into a black neighborhood for any reason then every white American should be made aware of the situation intead of being kept in the dark. </p>
<p>I actually believe that our government is well aware of the dangers posed to white Americans by blacks Americans but have no real solution to the problems so they do what they normally do and that&rsquo;s to try to cover up and gloss over the problem.</p>
<p>I also believe that foreign governments understand what a weakness a muli-racial society can be and would exploit this weakness given the opportunity.  I think that communist governments have been useing this weakness against us from the very beginning. </p>
<p>What we have is white Americans being sacrificed to keep from opening this pandora&rsquo;s box of racial instability. </p>

<p>&gt; I appreciate your post.  One thing that I think ought to be pointed out is that the parents of these two innocent, young, whites had been on MSM initially, I saw them.  They were commenting on the demonstration made by the American Nazi Party concerning this case.  They said that their kids would never have approved of this demonstation and were not racist or any thing like that.  I also recall that Amren had an article on this and many of us posted comments.  What I recall of my comment still stands; It is that any affiliation with the American Nazi Party is going to shoot down any white realist, survival movement because it is not based on a politically viable model and dredges up a set of values and outcomes that was not good for anyone, including Germans themselves.  </p>
<p>But I do wonder very much, if this trial has been giving the parents a new view of race that is more - realistic?</p>

		<p>Few crimes have been more heinous than this one. Why was there a media blackout? I would like the Justice Dept. to investigate the reason for the cover up. Are these two young people to be forgotten because of political correctness? I hope someone will write a book about this horrible miscarriage of justice. This is<br>
akin to the cover up of the myriad of crimes committed by illegal aliens. When did we become so beholden to criminal minorities that we can&rsquo;t speak out, as we would about crimes committed by our own race?</p>

		<p>I was researching the details of this case, and looked at what Snopes.  &mdash;  - said about it.  I found what they had to say highly insulting, and will no longer consider them a credible source.  They always seem to go for the most &#8216;orthodox&rsquo; viewpoint, whether or not that viewpoint accurately reflects reality.</p>

<p>Those of you have never been into court as an innocent defendant for anything substantial, or as in the present case, have no idea how corrupt the situation is.  </p>
<p>It is really sad beyond description to hear people talk about court cases. The controlled news and infotainment carefully constructs the opinions people have about court and trials.  Currently, with the Judge Judy and Perry Mason shows the TV viewer is made to believe that the judge is without bias and is seeking to help the good lawyers arrive at an equitable solution. Most people readily believe this.</p>
<p>What is really happening is this: the judge is trying to help the lawyers make as much money as possible.  The quaint notion that the judge cares about the merits is a fiction.</p>
<p>If any Amrenner should happen to read this and not believe it, it is only because he or she has never been to court but has watched a lot of TV and thus has an opinion about matters truly unknown.</p>

<p>And none of us would have heard of this case or the Wichita Horror, or the huge number of black-on-White hate crimes if it weren&rsquo;t for the Internet  &mdash;  which the government is currently trying to monitor, censor  and control, along with a furious push to eradicate the First Amendment via Hate Speech legislation.</p>
<p>I recently brought up the New Black Panther case in Philadelphia (where Whites were intimidated at polling places by black thugs) at my school.  Not one teacher  &mdash;  NOT ONE  &mdash;  had heard of this case and thought I was making it up  &mdash;  although they knew of (what they were sure was) voter intimidation in Florida during the 2000 election.  </p>
<p>They were happy to tell me about road blocks and checkpoints used to turn away black voters and harassment and intimidation of blacks by police officials.  Dogs and hoses were used to drive black voters from the polls.  Supposed black disenfranchisement was front-page national news for months, investigated by The Justice Department and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.  All of the allegations were proved false.</p>
<p>I downloaded a news story about White voter intimidation and the outcome  &mdash;  complete with a picture of the odious eric holder (from Michelle Malkin):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Justice Department political appointees overruled career lawyers and ended a civil complaint accusing three members of the New Black Panther Party of wielding a nightstick and intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling place last Election Day, according to documents and interviews.</p>
<p>Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as &#8216;the most blatant form of voter intimidation&rsquo; that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/mzm44f" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/mzm44f</a></p>
<p>Even then, fellow &#8216;teachers&rsquo; refused to believe the article and that something like that could happen in &#8216;this day and age.&rsquo;  Yeah, right.  BTW:  Teachers were both black and White.</p>
<p>Could you imagine the outrage from Whites if the Knoxville Horror, Wichita Massacre and statistics (Hate Facts) about black-on-White crimes  were properly vetted by the msm and made national front page news for months on end?</p>
<p>Would Whites then bring out the torches and pitchforks?</p>
<p>Instead, when it comes to black-on- White injustices including murder, no matter how sensational, the msm playbook is to either report the story on the back pages at the bottom of the &#8216;Lifestyle&rsquo; section exactly one time with multiple claims of &#8216;race had absolutely (must include the word &#8216;absolutely&rsquo;) nothing to do with it&rsquo; or, more commonly, to not report these stories at all.</p>
<p>May the msm crash once and for all and burn in hell for what they&rsquo;ve done to Whites.</p>

		<p>Were I not a reader of Middle American News, I would never have heard of this particular black-on-white atrocity. And the reason for this cover-up is not far to seek: that racial fraction -in fact, my own - which overwhlmingly owns, controls, and infests our national mass media knows how to coddle its ethnic dupes and so maintain their political support. Imagine, if you will, if this satanic evil had been perpetrated by 5 whites on a young black couple. We would be hearing about it, in screaming headlines, for the next 50 years.    </p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any indications of that.</p>
<p>The damage of integration in the U.S. has been two-pronged: all the direct injuries such as crime and ruined neighborhoods and schools, and the obscuring of all that by the fact that so many whites now have close acquaintance with and fondness for able and pleasant individual blacks (fondness of an egalitarian sort, not the kind of fondness that existed in the old South).</p>
<p>Feelings are obviously very warm between the Christians and Takisha Fitzgerald, the black prosecutor in this case who gave a beautiful, effective, and impassioned closing argument in this trial that had me bawling. She&rsquo;s a very difficult figure to dislike, much less to wish to return to a subordinate position such as she would have had under segregation. Even black manners of speech and behavior that make my blood boil when I observe them in many other blacks seem charming to me when she exhibits them.</p>
<p>There is also a very popular black Knoxville radio host, Hallerin Hilton Hill (slightly conservative, I think, but I&rsquo;m guessing), who did a lengthy interview recently with the Christians and the Newsoms&hellip;he did an excellent job, and feelings were obviously very warm between him and the Christians, in whose home he had visited to do an earlier interview. He certainly seemed like a fine fellow (certainly not the kind of black I&rsquo;m used to hearing on the radio out here in Berkeley!)</p>
<p>Knoxville still seems to have a small-town flavor, a feeling of community, and as far as I can tell, blacks who are &#8220;okay&#8221; have been accepted into the community with the old South warmth that still lingers there.</p>
<p>The U.S. will probably have to nearly disintegrate into economic and social chaos for whites to ever get their heads straight now&hellip;.any real solution to our racial problems currently is too offensive to whites&rsquo; notions of individual fair play that our ideological masters have constructed their brainwashing upon.</p>
