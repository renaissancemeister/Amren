<h1>NABJ Questions NPR&rsquo;s Diversity Commitment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Prince, Maynard Institute of Journalism Education, October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Association of Black Journalists has reacted to the firing of Greg Peppers, one of two black men in National Public Radio&rsquo;s newsroom management, with a strongly worded letter questioning the network&rsquo;s commitment to diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are the managers of color at NPR?&#8221; NABJ President Kathy Times and Vice President/Broadcast Bob Butler asked NPR&rsquo;s president, Vivian Schiller.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is NPR doing to recruit and groom African Americans for positions in management? Of the 68 members on your corporate team and behind-the-scenes staff, only eight are people of color:</p>
<p>* &#8220;4 African Americans,</p>
<p>* &#8220;2 Hispanic Americans,</p>
<p>* &#8220;1 Iranian American</p>
<p>* &#8220;1 American from South Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;That translates to about 12 percent. Your organization benefits from listener support, corporate donations and tax dollars from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting and should reflect the diversity of the community you serve. The minority population of the United States is approximately 32 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peppers, a 22-year NPR veteran who supervised NPR&rsquo;s newscast unit, was fired on Oct. 16 and escorted out of its Washington headquarters.</p>
<p>It was less than 24 hours after NPR hosted NABJ at the building for a program featuring CBS correspondent Byron Pitts, and the same day that Walt Swanston turned in her resignation as NPR&rsquo;s director of diversity management, citing health reasons.</p>
<p>Peppers, 52, has not spoken publicly about his dismissal, and NPR spokeswoman Anna Christopher told Journal-isms [the name of Prince&rsquo;s column] then, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t comment on [an] employee&rsquo;s reasons for departure or any other personnel matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher said on Wednesday that Schiller, who became NPR&rsquo;s chairman and CEO 10 months ago, had not yet received NABJ&rsquo;s letter but planned to respond. NABJ spokesman Abraham Mahshie said the letter was mailed on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Peppers&rsquo; firing comes 10 months after NPR dismissed Next Generation Radio creator Doug Mitchell, who has trained scores of young journalists, including many African Americans, for jobs in the broadcasting industry,&#8221; the letter noted.</p>
<p>It also quoted a statement from the NPR Web site: &#8220;Diversity is a fundamental part of everything we do at NPR, and of our ability to offer relevant news, culture, and entertainment programming to an increasingly diverse public. Diversity is a cornerstone of our recruitment, programming, and talent development initiatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NABJ leaders said, &#8220;It is NABJ&rsquo;s belief that actions speak much louder than your words. It is not enough to provide internships for young people or hire them into entry-level positions. Diversity must also be reflected among the managers who decide what news gets covered and who gets to cover it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The association then offered itself as a resource.</p>
<p>NABJ this year honored Michele Norris, a co-host of NPR&rsquo;s popular newsmagazine &#8220;All Things Considered,&#8221; as its Journalist of the Year at its summer convention. But for the first time in years, NPR did not broadcast any shows from the convention, citing financial restraints.</p>
<p>African American men, particularly, have had a checkered history in the NPR corporate culture. The network once had an African American chief executive, Delano Lewis, who served from 1994 to 1998, and an African American vice president of information and news, Adam Clayton Powell III, who joined in 1987 but left in 1991.</p>
<p>Blair Walker IV of USA Today wrote in 1993 of Powell&rsquo;s moves to create more diversity at NPR: &#8220;Among other things, displeasure with Powell&rsquo;s efforts prompted &#8216;racist comments about new (minority) hires before they even arrived,&rsquo; he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of African American men on-air, ranging from former hosts Tavis Smiley and Ed Gordon and reaching back to Sunni Khalid, the former Cairo bureau chief who in 1997 filed a $2 million discrimination suit against the network, have also had issues with NPR. Khalid and NPR reached a settlement in 2003.</p>
<p>Schiller told the Washington Business Journal last week that, &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t have diversity in the newsroom, we don&rsquo;t have the right minds working on how to best serve that audience,&#8221; Tierney Plumb of the Business Journal reported. &#8220;What do I really know about the African American community as a white woman? So that&rsquo;s a big area of focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher said after Swanston&rsquo;s resignation that Schiller &#8220;has selected a diverse group of staff to join her and members of the executive team in developing strategic goals and action plans around diversity in recruitment and retention; our work environment; our programming/content; and our audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peppers&rsquo; departure left Keith W. Jenkins, supervising senior producer for multimedia, as the sole African American man in NPR newsroom management. Jenkins joined NPR last year after taking a buyout from the Washington Post, where he was multimedia director.</p>

		<p>The real issue could very well be that this NPR employee did something detrimental to a white member of the staff. We&rsquo;ll never know of course because there isn&rsquo;t an association of White Journalists because if there were the members would be quickly fired by the very same NPR. I guess a little bit of diversity is a good thing, but too much would be really bad. Sometimes discrimination isn&rsquo;t good. Other times it&rsquo;s just great. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not many non-whites working at National Public Radio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and doesn&rsquo;t the highlighting of that prove that we are a melting pot and race doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it hilarious the way the PC dorks whine about needing to count beans, then declare that skin color shouldn&rsquo;t matter?</p>

		<p>Fascinating! How odd that not one iota of info is available  &mdash;  not even speculation  &mdash;  as to why they dumped the black guy. But that&rsquo;s not surprising to me, given past history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been interested in what people really think at NPR, ever since they &#8220;promoted&#8221;  Bob Edwards right out of his job as anchor (and a very good one) of the &#8220;Morning Edition&#8221; show. The wagons were circled tight and fast as to why, although it is reported that he described his network&rsquo;s audience as &#8220;too white&#8221;. It would make perfect sense, of course, that such an egregiously offensive and stupid slur against <i>whites</i> would cause indignation among the usual suspects for exactly the wrong reasons, but it could be seen as a case of Justice with a capital J for Big Bob. He&rsquo;s made it clear for many years that Too White really is a serious problem to be fixed, in his mind. He&rsquo;d ridden on the anti-white wagon a long time, he fell off, and got smacked. Good! (He&rsquo;s back on that wagon, by the way.}</p>
<p>Of course he landed on his feet  &mdash;  his kind always seem to do that. He does a daily show on Sirius Radio, and a weekend show that I listen to on the local public radio station.</p>
<p>But I always wonder what kind of conversation might have occurred after he went off the reservation  &mdash;  maybe something like &#8220;Bob, your career as a broadcaster will last exactly as long as you say the right things, and nothing about why NPR dumped you. Comprende?&#8221;</p>
<p>I see the article mentioned current NPR anchor Michelle Norris. I was aware that she is &#8220;diverse&#8221;, but she actually manages my native language pretty well, which I consider a pretty good indicator of IQ. Sure enough, her photo suggests a significant fraction of white ancestry: she&rsquo;s actually attractive, in my view.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a very interesting tidbit from her page on the NPR website: </p>
<p>&#8220;Norris attended the University of Wisconsin, where she majored in electrical engineering, and graduated from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where she studied journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  Huh? from double-E to J-school? What the heck is that about? Well, I can&rsquo;t say of course, but it sure is <i>consistent</i> with a &#8220;diverse&#8221; AA golden child finally running into the evil reality of having to understand and solve all those pesky equations. But it looks pretty good on a &#8220;journalist&rsquo;s&#8221; resume, of course. </p>
<p>And again, at least she can write and speak coherent sentences. It could be worse.</p>

		<p>I know this sounds crazy, but I think liberals are far more likely to adopt pro-white attitudes than conservatives after they&rsquo;ve been forced to work and live among non-whites.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t very many white conservatives who would object to living in an America populated with 300 million Uncle Toms  &mdash;  I mean, Thomas Sowells.</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re Christians dedicated to Free Market principles conservatives are probably more pro-non-white than liberals.</p>
<p>Liberals are only pro-diversity if they don&rsquo;t actually have to participate in diversity.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s crazy at all.  I have seen how White liberals react the first time they are exposed to large numbers of non-Whites or are mistreated for being White.  The subconscious racism that was always there boils to the surface and they adopt an explicit White identity.  No one as lily White and prissy as the typical White liberal could actually like Blacks or Mexicans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Some Guy&#8221; I have wondered very much the same thing. In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen evidence that there is no small degree of truth in it. Conservatives may be more inclined to crack and off-color joke, or graon about Affirmative Action here and there, etc. But they don&rsquo;t really SEE race at all - the Sowell analogy is valid. Liberals, on the other hand, see race in EVERYTHING! And sooner or later, some of them actually begin to admit they don&rsquo;t exactly like what they see, and that maybe they have been mislead. Of course some bleeding-hearts will never concede reality - but more might than some Conservatives might believe. </p>

<p>Liberals probably got their attitudes handed to them in colleges nationwide; this indoctrination is not as enduring as an experience like, say, being a white man in the public school system in Philly or being a white social worker.  </p>
<p>As for a conservative   &mdash;   if he just &#8220;earned&#8221; his beliefs by reading National Review or something, then he might be swayed more easily.</p>

		<p>    This is typical liberal behavior by NPR. They tirelessly advocate diversity for the rest of us, and yet don&rsquo;t practice it themselves. The few blacks and minorities they have are pushed to the front to give the impression that they are more numerous than they actually are.</p>

<p>I question the networks commitment to diversity as well. Right now it&rsquo;s a mono-culture obsessed &#8216;news&rsquo; organization looking for every black centric event/news/tidbit they can find. When they can&rsquo;t fill the voids with &#8216;reporting&rsquo;, they spend an hour fluffing about some non-event black centric hyperbole.  </p>
<p>God help the foolish whites that donate to this twisted organization.</p>

		<p>Pat Buchanan has the right idea- demand all of those who push diversity to begin with themselves. If Harry Reid says we need more diversity in the senate, than he should give his seat to a black guy. </p>
<p>NPR has story after story about the benefits of diversity and multiculti. lets start with them, with proportional representation. </p>

&ldquo;Some Guy&rdquo; I have wondered very much the same thing. In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen evidence that there is no small degree of truth in it.

Of course some bleeding-hearts will never concede reality - but more might than some Conservatives might believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I not only have said this in past posts, but I would posit as I often do, that the future of any White Survival movement depends upon Liberals who come to see the lie of multiculturalism, integration, etc., mostly by way of exposure to its practical results. (As if it is not plain enough yet!) </p>
<p>It is almost and largely the &#8220;Prarie Home Companion,&#8221; a long running NPR program, loved by many, especially in the Northern Midwest that has retained the large mass of NPR listeners.  Garrison Keilor, its creator, narrator, and &#8220;master of ceremonies&#8221; while a greatly talented humorist and writer, who actually is helping preserve a large portion of White, Old Northwest Culture, as well as White Culture in general, cannot hide, and does not try to hide, the disconnected old Lutheran style liberal that reflexively supports the principles of Diversity and Multiculturalism.  This, even though Minneapolis and St. Paul have become plagued by non-white gangs and immigration.  The same stubborness that drives the preservation of that very White Culture his program makes so endearing to us also feeds the blindness that denies the coming death of the very culture &#8220;The Prarie Home Companion&#8221; celebrates. Of course, I see Christianity at the core of this problem, which again, is one of the many reasons I argue that Christianity is ultimately a bain to Whites, rather than a boon.<br/>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that at least 90% of the donations to NPR come from white people.  Over the years my local NPR station played less and less classical music (too white and elitist, you know) and instead had more and more liberal whites talking up diversity.  So I stopped listening and stopped donating.  I&rsquo;m all in favor of the white &#8220;progressives&#8221; working in public radio being fired and replaced by the diversity.  Let the diversity do the donating, too.  NPR should reap as NPR has sown.  </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget one of NPR&rsquo;s most prominent black journalists:</p>
<p>Mumia Abu Jamal.</p>
<p>He used to have a spot on &#8220;All Things Considered&#8221; - I think it was called &#8220;Live from Death Row&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;d like to get in on some of that class, class-action action too.  NPR just doesn&rsquo;t hire enough black murderers.</p>

		<p>6 Economist: White liberals despise working class Whites and mock their culture.  They cannot help but truly loathe Blacks and Mexicans since those &#8220;cultures&#8221; are so obviously inferior to ours.  It is only malice, ignorance, or an advanced capacity for self-delusion that allows liberals to imagine that they are really multi-culturalists.</p>
