<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2009-10-13-census_N.htm?csp=34">Senators Try to Exclude Illegal Immigrants From 2010 Census</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, October 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial amendment that would require the Census Bureau to ask for the first time whether people are in the USA illegally is headed for a Senate vote Wednesday.</p>
<p>Proposed last week by Republican Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana and Bob Bennett of Utah, the amendment would exclude illegal immigrants from the population count used to allocate congressional seats after the 2010 Census. It also would require the Census to ask people whether they are citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal aliens should not be included for the purposes of determining representation in Congress, and that&rsquo;s the bottom line here,&#8221; Vitter says. If enacted, the amendment to an appropriations bill would stop funding of the 2010 Census unless the changes are made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By law, the Census is taken April 1. State population counts must be submitted to the president the following Dec. 31 so that seats in the House of Representatives can be apportioned.</p>
<p>Since the first Census in 1790, the bureau has routinely asked in various surveys whether people are native-born or foreign-born, but it has never asked about legal status.</p>
<p>Immigrants often are the hardest to count because many mistrust government, especially if they are in the USA illegally. Crackdowns on illegal immigration at the border and at work sites have made outreach for next year&rsquo;s Census even more challenging.</p>

		<p>We went from around 281 million people from the 2000 census to a little over 304 million in 2008.  Legal immigration doesn&rsquo;t account for such a huge jump in numbers.  Counting illegals is disenfranchising the American voter.  Not only are they fraudulently voting in the polling places but their mere presence could give a state an electoral advantage.  The number of electoral votes is based on the amount of population.  </p>

		<p>Great idea, because illegal aliens are going to come right out and willingly say that they&rsquo;re here illegally.  </p>

		<p> Many illegal aliens already are reported to use forged or stolen ID to work.<br/>
 If they lie about being able to legally work in the US and/or about who they are why would they tell the truth about whether they are citizens to the Census ?</p>

		<p>I know one way of telling if illegals were counted or not&hellip;.<br/>
Massachusetts should lose at least 1, possibly 2, house seats.  If they lose none, than illegals were counted.</p>

		<p>Now just for WHAT REASON would the Senate prefer to not include illegals in the census count&hellip; other than to keep American Voters from learning the ugly truth about this invasion?</p>

		<p><i>A controversial amendment &hellip;</i></p>
<p>When did it become &#8220;controversial&#8221; to ask people if they&rsquo;re US citizens before including them in a US census?<br/>

		<p>I agree with Fed Up.. I think if Americans knew exactly how many illegals are in this country, there would be an even bigger backlash. Let them be counted! As I have said before, they have nothing to fear from our government. They DON&rsquo;T CARE! Get it? Now, the American people are a different story. The majority of us DO care, and our government knows this. Thats why they have repeated this 12 million number for years. They don&rsquo;t want us to know it&rsquo;s at least double that.</p>

		<p>Why not E-verify them. If they are claiming to be citizens they can be E-verified (later, after their data is collected) Any not what they claim, send the I.N.S.</p>
