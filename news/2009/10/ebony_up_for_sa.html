<h1><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/216176">Ebony: Up for Sale?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johnnie L. Roberts, Newsweek, September 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For 50 years, the Ebony Fashion Fair has been a glamorous social event in dozens of U.S. communities. The traveling fashion show has raised $55 million in college scholarships for African-American students. But this year the company behind the show, Johnson Publishing which publishes Ebony, pulled the plug on the event, citing lack of corporate sponsorship due to the recession. &#8220;This is devastating to us,&#8221; Ann Lee, publicity chairwoman for the Charmettes, a civic group that staged the event in Broward County, Fla., told The Miami Herald.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a year of excruciating decisions for publishing companies  &mdash;  layoffs, pullbacks, closures. Now it appears Johnson Publishing&rsquo;s chairman and CEO, Linda Johnson Rice, has reached what must have been an agonizing decision: Johnson Publishing is seeking a buyer or investor for its flagship publication, Ebony, in an effort aimed at securing the survival of the nation&rsquo;s oldest magazine devoted to African-American life. {snip}</p>
<p>According to media and investment executives familiar with the developments, Chicago-based Rice, the daughter of Ebony&rsquo;s legendary founder, the late John H. Johnson, has approached, among others, Time Inc., Viacom, and private investors that include buyout firms. Time Inc., the world&rsquo;s largest periodical publisher, already owns Essence, a monthly lifestyle, beauty, and fashion magazine for African-American women. Viacom, meanwhile, owns BET (Black Entertainment Television).</p>
<p>Nothing has yet resulted from any of Johnson Publishing&rsquo;s overtures, however. And it&rsquo;s unclear whether negotiations are underway between the publishing company and any of the identified parties or other potential rescuers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The economic downturn has killed off scores of magazines, including such prominent titles as Condé Nast Portfolio and Domino, while forcing others onto the auction block, including BusinessWeek. But the historic Ebony has fared worse than average amid the industry&rsquo;s woes. In fact, Ebony&rsquo;s advertising pages and ad revenues have declined in each of the last three years, even during periods when the industry was flat to positive. Among the 243 magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau, ad pages plunged an average of 28 percent, with revenues falling by 21 percent, in the first half of 2009 compared with the same period a year earlier. But Ebony&rsquo;s decline was sharper, as advertising dived almost 35 percent, dragging revenues down almost 32 percent, to $18.8 million from 2008&rsquo;s $27.7 million. And the deterioration of Jet magazine, Ebony&rsquo;s sister publication, was even more severe  &mdash;  about 40 percent in ad pages and revenues.</p>
<p>And according to industry tracker Media Industry Newsletter, things have only turned grimmer for Ebony since the first half. Total ad pages sank by 40 percent this year through the October issue, now on newsstands and featuring Whitney Houston on the cover, compared with 2008&rsquo;s January  &mdash;  October editions. {snip}</p>

		<p>So Newsweek cares more about a race of people, that being blacks, who don&rsquo;t make up the big chunk of their reading base, BUT they insist on writing articles that demonize the very race that pays their bills, that being us &#8220;evil racist white people.&#8221;  Please help me.

		<p>The problem is that Time-Warner wants to sell its glossy dead tree and ink properties, as well.  If Ebony is sold, or even if it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until it stops publication.</p>

In fact, Ebony&rsquo;s advertising pages and ad revenues have declined in each of the last three years, even during periods when the industry was flat to positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing Out Loud!!!!</p>
<p>To begin with, just what makes Ebony so &ldquo;historic&rdquo;? Is it the fact that it proved that blacks are capable of reading and believing social and science fiction as facts of life, or that blacks have a disposable income that can be wasted on such darkly ludicrous fish wrap? Moreover, why has the &ldquo;historic&rdquo; Ebony capsized and sunk so suddenly? Is it really because of the poor economy, or the fact that now that Obagasm has been reached, blacks have decided that the discarded copies of Condé Nast Portfolio and Domino to be found in the gutter make better and cheaper fish wrap? </p>
<p>Personally, I think it is a bit of: All of the Above!</p>
<p>As far as blacks are concerned, now that an African &ldquo;American&rdquo; is President of the United States, they have even less interest in investing into the limited &ldquo;intellectual stimulation&rdquo; reading an Ebony or a Jet magazine might offer them. It is old hat to them, because: &lsquo;They is be running things now and reading is now being just for wicked old Whitey.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Or put another way, much like their simpering and mentally challenged white Marxist counterparts, they see little value in digesting unadulterated propaganda that merely reinforces their phantasmal &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; impulses, when they &ldquo;think&rdquo; that they have already become a reality.</p>
<p>Diversity is our Strength; and of course, as always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>Actually, Ebony Magazine has done quite well for any magazine Black or White. It has been in existence since November 1945. Very few magazines can boast such a long tenure. Secondly, it was never one of these &#8220;hate Whitey&#8221; type of magazines like many of its contemporaries were.</p>
<p>The magazine&rsquo;s founder, the late John H. Johnson was a decent Black man who had friends all accross the political aisle and denouced that anti-White rhetoric that was commonplace among many other Black magazines. I hope it can stay around awhile. longer.</p>

Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Blacks tell us how under-represented they are in every aspect of American life and as such, they need special outlets and extra funding and support for their ventures. Once these ventures are up and running, the claim is that blacks will rush to the product or service.</p>
<p>These claims are largely exaggerated. If there was a real market for specialty black services, these would be thriving, self-sufficient ventures. </p>
<p>Of course, this vital link to the black community can not be left to end. Watch for backers to step in.<br>

		<p>So blacks are not buying ebony magazine? Not surprising, considering how blacks as a whole, fare in academics, especially reading. The only question is how the failure of this magazine can be blamed on Whitey. Or maybe Mr Obama can come through with a bailout for ebony?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the modern white movement for a decade now and it&rsquo;s impressive how far we&rsquo;ve come. We have many publications, web sites, and organizations that didn&rsquo;t exist back then. Whites who want to be helpful now have many choices. It would be a shame to lose what has been achieved in the present economic crisis. Check out the links section here and see if there is something you&rsquo;d like to support.</p>

		<p>Wow - there&rsquo;s a real loss to American culture. Better pick up that new Whitney Houston issue to stay up with current events. </p>
<p>This is from Wikipedia - so take it with a grain of salt - but this is what Newsweek is lamenting: </p>
<p>&#8220;In August 2008 the magazine [Ebony] featured a special 8-cover edition featuring the &#8220;25 Coolest Brothers of All Time&#8221;, the line up featured Jay-Z, Barack Obama, Prince, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Billy Dee Williams.&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;The traveling fashion show has raised $55 million in college scholarships for African-American students&#8221;. Call me naive but surely this indicates that a huge number of these students now lead very successful lives and so are morally responsible in repaying the cost of these scholarships in order to aid the very organisation that is responsible for their present personal financial comfort.</p>

		<p>Many years ago my wife and I(we&rsquo;re white) subscribed to Ebony to <br>
help out a black church that was selling subscriptions. We probably subscribed for 10 years or so until we moved and did not renew.  Let me say that Ebony was a class product in every way.  My memory is that it catered to what I suppose could be called the developing black middle class. More importantly in a practical sense, each issue contained a number of really fabulous recipes that featured Southern-style dishes that really could not be obtained in other publications. After all these years we still prepare Ebony inspired fried chicken and a number of spicey bean and veggie dishes that are quite wonderful. Sooooo&hellip;.  Thank you Ebony for contributing to our family&rsquo;s culinary enjoyment for many, many years.  As an aside, the death of Ebony (and magazines in general) leaves a void in American life and culture that we of a certain age can only deeply regret. Soon the tradition of the morning paper will be gone along with movies and bookstores.  Ebony is part of that loss&hellip;.</p>

<p>I think Ebony magazine was a decent magazine and I don&rsquo;t have problem with American Blacks, Black African Americans having their own magazines, clubs, associations provided they are positive and do not promote hatred of White people.</p>
<p>Blacks can and should have their own things, their own places, neighborhoods, schools - not forced segregation, just voluntary association. That&rsquo;s what we want for our people.</p>

		<p>If Ebony was selling well, then advertisers would be flocking to the pages, but there not. Kind of the same thing you see in bookstores. Shelves of books devolved to Black Studies, Culture, History, ect, but few Blacks in the stores or anyone else for that matter buying them. Just a waste of floor space for book dealers to loose money on. Floor space cost money, just like the pages of a magazine.</p>
<p>Best way for bookstores to get Blacks inside their stores would be not have any books about Blacks. Then the Blacks would show up in droves, demanding that they carry books of Color. Of course, they still wouldn&rsquo;t buy anything, just make demands.<br>

		<p>Subscriptions for virtually all written publications have lagged, for several reasons. Television and movies have reduced Americans&rsquo; attention span to a nanosecond; if it doesn&rsquo;t flash, explode or a multitude of colors zip across a screen most people are not interested in it. The internet, economics, and a dismal education system have combined to eliminate any interest in reading anything that requires page turning.  </p>

<p>I do not apologize for reading Ebony magazine. I stand by what I said, it was a good, decent magazine that focused on the positive. Moreover, as Toby mentioned, the recipies were FABULOUS!</p>
<p>For the record, I also listen to old Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald albums. Does this make me an race traitor? <br>
For that matter,  does any Black or other non-White who listens to Frank Sinatra have a hatred of themselves? Such an argument is ridculous and foolish.</p>

<p>By your logic, it would be okay to read Hustler magazine because it is geared toward White blue collar people, but not Ebony even though it is/was a positive magazine that chronicled the lives of decent, hardworking, talented upscale Blacks and did not engage in the crude, nasty, over the top perverted smut that a number of Black (and many White magazines geared to younger Whites)do. Give me a break!!!!</p>
<p>I also further the declaration with Toby and Beverly, the recipies were/are among the best there were for any magazine. My wife and I loved the sweet potato pie and macaroni and cheese recipies. </p>
<p>As I earlier stated I hope the magazine survives and I make no apologies for saying so. If tihs makes me a &#8220;race traitor&#8221; in your eyes than so be it.<br>
  <br>
Sometimes, I honestly beleive that it is the irrational extremists like you that are the problem.</p>

		<p>White Patriot, Ebony really was pretty ok.  I never bought a copy, or more than perused it while waiting for my Volvo to be serviced, but it wasn&rsquo;t bad at all.  We&rsquo;re just telling the truth.</p>
<p>And I actually went to the Fashion Fair a couple of times, decades back: once in Memphis, and once, I think, in Jackson.  The black girls in Jackson gave me serious attitude, but Jackson people of all colors are less-than-pleasant, anyway.  I had a guy friend who was a bit of a drag queen, and we went for the fashions, which were fabulous, as was the show.  It was definitely the most glamorous public happening in our neck of the woods.  So I wish Ebony well.</p>
