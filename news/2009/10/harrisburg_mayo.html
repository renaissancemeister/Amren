<h1><a href="https://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2009/10/harrisburg_mayoral_candidate_l_2.html">Harrisburg Mayoral Candidate Linda Thompson Tells More About Her Finances</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Smith, Patriot-News (Harrisburg), October 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over the years, mayoral candidate Linda Thompson has taken Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed&rsquo;s administration to task for not being transparent. When it comes to answering questions about her sources of income, her nonprofit, her car, or the unemployment she claims to have once received, she&rsquo;s less than crystal clear.</p>
<p>In a debate Wednesday night, Thompson said she had given her life to Loveship Inc., the nonprofit she created in 2000. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve taken all of my unemployment checks that I had before I started Loveship and put every dime of it into Loveship,&#8221; Thompson said during the debate.</p>
<p>The Patriot-News followed up on Thursday and e-mailed Thompson questions concerning her unemployment and other issues that emerged from the statements of financial interest  &mdash;  which are from the state Ethics Commission  &mdash;  that she filed with the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here are the questions and Thompson&rsquo;s written responses. She would not clarify any of her answers by phone.</p>
<p>Question: When were you unemployed, and from what organization did you lose your job?</p>
<p>Thompson: &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t lose my job. I voluntarily resigned from my employment with the Urban League of Metropolitan Harrisburg.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Q: How long did you collect unemployment? How long were you unemployed?</p>
<p>Thompson: &#8220;Approximately six months to 1 year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: On your statement of financial interest that you filed on March 10, 2009, it indicates that you received a zero-percent-interest loan from Loveship Inc. What was the amount of the loan and what was its purpose? Was that money used to fund your campaign? Have you repaid that loan?</p>
<p>Thompson: &#8220;My loan was for personal reasons unrelated to my campaign. The amount of the loan is reflected in my statement of financial interests and the repayment terms are in accordance with contractual terms negotiated by the board of directors. My campaign finance reports show the sources of all my funding for the past decade, none of which came from Loveship Inc.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in an earlier interview, Thompson indicated that her car was a gift from a brother. (One of her brothers, Steven Crawford, received a settlement from the state after his murder conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in 2002 after 28 years.)</p>
<p>Question: You indicated yesterday that your car was a gift from your brother. The statement of financial interest lists an 8.25 percent Chase Auto Financial Loan. Is that for your Mercedes, or do you own another car?</p>
<p>Thompson: &#8220;I never stated my car was a gift from my brother. Quote me accurately. I stated that my brother was very generous to me. The auto loan indicated in my statement of financial interests is for the vehicle which I currently drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following Gov. Ed Rendell&rsquo;s endorsement of Thompson at the state Democratic headquarters on Wednesday, Thompson was asked about her car and sources of income. Here is how she answered:</p>
<p>Question: If you get $20,500 from City Council and a Mercedes far exceeds that amount of money.&nsbp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Thompson: &#8220;I have a brother that was very, very kind to me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Period.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the unemployment law of Pennsylvania, but its likely - just as in the other states - that voluntary resignation is not cause to be provided unemployment moneys.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Attorney General of the State, as well as the nation&rsquo;s chief Attorney General should conduct an investigation to determine if The Urban League of Metropolitan Harrisburg - likely a non profit race related organization whose cost is borne by the taxpayers of Pennsylvania and the nation - is running a scam to reward its political activist associates.</p>

		<p>Ronald is correct. Unless something drastic has changed, voluntary resignation would absolutely NOT entitle one to unemployment payment. For heavens&rsquo; sake, if that were the case, every time someone decided they didn&rsquo;t like their job anymore, they would just quite, collect some cash for a while, and move on at will. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way&hellip;at least not yet!!</p>

		<p>She is just a sample of widespread advantage-taking by minorities.</p>
<p>I rent houses. I have people pull up in cars very like unto the afore-mentioned Mercedes. Sometimes they drive two separate late-model cars with all the accessories.</p>
<p>Some of them are on section 8, which I do not accept. Most of them talk about hiring a lawn service to mow their yard, if I rent to them. If they have, say, three children, each one of them has a different last name. </p>
<p>My wife and I have worked very, very hard to get where we are, and have sacrificed much for our children.</p>
<p>When these people show up, or I even think of them, I get very angry.</p>
<p>But I think I am more angry and disgusted at the politicians and others who are letting down the middle-class Whites.</p>
<p>I am convinced that many blacks and some Whites are gaming the system. The elite are counting on the Whites&rsquo; sense of honor to keep the whole thing going. But that, too, seems to be eroding among the young.       </p>

		<p>Calm down folks, this is probably the governments secret program of reparations for slavery and even if it isn&rsquo;t, it needs to be counted as such. The corruption involving the various social services in states like California, is legendary. It probably goes on in all states. It&rsquo;s mindboggling to think of the type of entitled culture that liberals have turned the U.S. into. The truth is, they should be prosecuted severly, for the ruination of a great nation.</p>

		<p>Lost in the Liberal Nightmare,POST #5, I appreciate what you wrote.</p>
<p>My friends, and people I have met casually in California, cannot believe the amount of graft, corruption, gaming of the system as you call it, and every other kind of criminality going on in this state and,  &mdash;  MOST OF IT CAN BE TRACED TO LIBERAL POLICIES. Oh, yes, how well you described it. The two late-model cars, the way they communicate(totally state entitled inspired language),the gold chains around the neck, the expensive hair styles, and pedicures, WHILE THEY HAND OVER THE FOOD STAMP CREDIT CARD,ETC.</p>
<p>I especially appreciate observation that, &#8220;The elite are counting on the Whites sense of honor to keep the whole thing going. A TRUER OBSERVATION ON THE WHOLE ISSUE HAS RARELY BEEN UTTERED. THANK YOU, for this PROFOUND observation. Americans who continue to back liberal policies are participating in the dismantling and destruction of their own nation, BECAUSE THE MONEY IS GOING TO RUN OUT AND ALL THAT WILL BE LEFT IS CHAOS AND STRIFE.</p>
