<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6871900.ece">&#8216;Michael Jackson&rsquo; Women in Tanzania Search for Chinese Husbands</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Clayton, Times of London, October 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zaina, 28, a tall Tanzanian woman, intends to cash in on the new Chinese presence in Africa. She is planning to find herself an oriental husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hoped to get a Westerner like you,&#8221; she told The Times. &#8220;But they are few and far between these days and Chinese are not so fussy and I&rsquo;m not getting any younger. They say they are racist, but they like local women.&#8221;</p>
<p>As her eyes darted around the appropriately named Jolly nightclub and bar, she admitted that she faced an uphill struggle. The competition is ferocious. Apart from a solitary Chinese man, quietly sipping a beer at the bar and a group of young men playing pool, the favourite after-work drinking hole is overflowing with groups of young women, chatting excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is early, Chinese men work hard and come later, they not lazy like Tanzanians,&#8221; Zaina said. &#8220;Problem is many, many girls; me not really their type. I am tall and slim. They prefer small, fat ladies with paler skins,&#8221; she said, confiding with a whisper that some of the girls were busy applying skin-lightening ointment. &#8220;They buy it in Congo  &mdash;  we call them the Michael Jacksons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Word has spread through Dar es Salaam, Tanzania&rsquo;s main commercial centre, that many of the Chinese men who have flooded into the country in recent years are open to marrying local women. In reality, only a handful of marriages have taken place.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of Chinese entering the country were first noted in 1986, mainly attributed to trade liberalisation as the country moved from a Socialist-style planned economy to a Western-backed market one. Since then the Chinese have been at the centre of accusations linked to wildlife slaughter, illegal export of timber and other minerals, counterfeit goods production and a growing trade in drugs and prostitution.</p>
<p>Critics of the growing relationship with Beijing say that Chinese are now marrying local women to circumvent restrictions on foreigners gaining residency permits and owning land and companies. Such restrictions often do not apply to people married to Tanzanian nationals who can easily also gain nationality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see the Chinese presence as positive because it is a one-way street. The Chinese want to trade in their own products, which they subsidise. Ten years down the road our local industries will not exist,&#8221; said Hussein Kamote, of the Confederation of Tanzania Industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;They love our women, especially the ones with big bottoms. I don&rsquo;t know why they have that reputation for racism. That&rsquo;s certainly not the case here.&#8221; Others say that the Chinese are using their women as mules to carry ivory from poached elephants and rhinos out of the country and drugs on the way back again.</p>
<p>In July, a Dar es Salaam businesswoman with connections to Chinese traders was detained at the international airport for allegedly trying to smuggle elephant tusks and carvings made from ivory in a suitcase destined for the Far East.</p>
<p>Like the rest of Africa, where in 2007 China had investments totalling $3.3 billion (Â£2 billion) from almost nothing a decade earlier, Tanzania has benefited from a host of major infrastructure projects. In August, using its enormous war chest of foreign currency savings, China said that it was investing $400 million in a scandal-hit coal mine.</p>
<p>On a visit to the country last February, President Hu Jintao granted an additional $22 million in aid, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>&#8220;The friendship between China and Tanzania .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can be viewed as an exemplary relationship of sincerity, solidarity and co-operation between China and an African country,&#8221; Mr Hu said. Many Tanzanians, particularly those outside government, are not so sure.<br>

<p>Sounds like &#8216;projection&rsquo; to me. Then again I suppose accusing Chinese of poaching, drug dealing, organized crime, and the undertones of &#8216;sexual exploitation&rsquo;? here - I suppose that&rsquo;s all considered &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; and fighting bigotry in right-thinking multicultural Africa.</p>

		<p>If those Chinese/Tanzanian couples remain in Africa, this arrangement could solve some problems: the woman shortage in China could be alleviated by exporting excess males to Africa.  The local average I.Q. would rise and, as a result, that part of Africa might become more self-sufficient.  The Chinese work ethic might spur some locals to work harder.  In reality, however, this is what I predict:  Local African men will feel resentment and attack such couples.  A number of Chinese men will be killed.  As a result, there will be an exodus of mixed couples back to China.  To put it lightly, black Africans do not tolerate diversity in their homeland very much - though they love to impose it on others.</p>

		<p>The real test is, Will he take her home to meet Mom and Dad?  Fat chance.  Enjoy the ride, ladies, and hope he leaves you a few bucks when he goes home.  It won&rsquo;t be much, because he&rsquo;ll want as big a roll as possible to flash in front of a nice Chinese girl back in the provinces.  </p>

		<p>These &#8220;couples&#8221; will never be allowed back in China.  China will control all of Tanzania&rsquo;s natural resources, and these Chinese/tanzanian hybrids will eventually be the buffers.  It is so hard to find good native help.  </p>

<p>Asian&rsquo;s have certainly been sending the USA huge quantities of cars, and consumer and industrial goods, for nothing in return going on 40 years now. George Gilder even wrote a book on it. </p>

		<p>It will be interesting to see the ramifications of this a few decade from now. With the burgeoning male population in China due to the one child per family rule. What if (anything is possible) in 3-4 decades there are 100,000 chinese males with african wives.</p>
<p>How intelligent would these children be?<br>
How athletic would they be?<br>
What would they be like psychologically<br>
How much higher would their IQ go up?</p>
<p>What if tanzania or any other african country in which china is making inroads into turns into a giant half black/half chinese hoard of people.</p>

		<p>That part of Africa is the Swahili Coast. The folks in some measure are a mix of Arabic, Persian, Indian, and African. Look dark but practice a non-African type culture. And the Chinese do have a historical link to this area, from the treasure fleet sailings of Admiral Zheng He in the 1400&rsquo;s. The Great White Hunter is now replaced with the Great Yellow Hunter. In a figurative as well as a literal sense! Chinese penetration now and in the future of Africa will be all pervasive and domineering in a way that the white colonial powers were domineering and controlling!</p>

		<p>Schoolteacher, you are probably right, but the shortage of marriageable girls in China leads me to believe that there will be more Chinamen marrying these Africans than one might think.  I certainly prefer that to their infestation of Western Russia and the marriages between Chinese men and Russian women. </p>

<p>   This is new to me. Most Chinese men I know like petite women with small behinds. They don&rsquo;t like dark skinned muscular women with &#8220;junk in the trunk.&#8221; Maybe, it&rsquo;s a matter of taking what you can get?</p>

		<p>When males are 80% of the babies born to a society for 2 generations. I suppose standards drop &hellip; I expect a lot of half oriental babies will be born around there only to be abandoned when dad goes home. I am sure someone will bring them to  the west to be adopted.  </p>

		<p>Hmm. Sad but Africa&rsquo;s best hope for emerging from darkness is probably to pimp their women out to foreigners such as the Chinese who are short on women. Since it seems unlikely that the women would be accepted by Chinese society in the motherland, they will probably be left behind with their hybrid Chinese-African offspring who will hopefully avoid being slaughtered long enough form a elite ruling class.</p>

<p>To be honest I have not had a chance to ask Chinese men if they like girls with large behinds, </p>

		<p>9-Anon: I&rsquo;m with you on Chinese men taking Russian women.  Let them have the Africans instead.  But I still don&rsquo;t think there will be much space for the Sino-Afro offspring in the Celestial Empire.  As posters 5, 7, and 12 have written, there will likely be a crop of smarter-than-the-average-Blacks in East Africa.  Still, if they&rsquo;re anything like the partly White Blacks we have in America, don&rsquo;t expect Tanzania to rise above the level of South Philly or Watts.  </p>
