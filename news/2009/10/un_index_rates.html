			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Comcast.net News, October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Norway enjoys the world&rsquo;s highest quality of life, while Niger suffers the lowest, a U.N. agency said Monday, as it released a ranking that highlights the wide disparities in well-being between rich and poor countries.</p>
<p>The annual Human Development Index, unveiled in Bangkok by the United Nations Development Program, takes into account life expectancy, literacy, school enrollment and per capita gross domestic product in 182 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;A child born in Niger can expect to live to just over 50 years, which is 30 years less than a child born in Norway. Furthermore, the differences in per capita income are huge for every dollar earned per person in Niger, US$85 are earned in Norway,&#8221; UNDP said.</p>
<p>Norway was followed by Australia and Iceland on the list, which drew on statistics dating from 2007, before Iceland was hit hard in global economic crisis. Afghanistan and Sierra Leone rounded out the bottom of the ranking.</p>
<p>The United States was listed 13th.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Most migrants, internal and international, reap gains in the form of higher incomes, better access to education and health and improved prospects for their children,&#8221; said the report. &#8220;These gains often directly benefit family members who stay behind as well as countries of origin indirectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also suggested that as the populations age in developed countries, they could benefit from increased migration to boost their work forces.</p>
<p>But it cautioned that encouraging migration should not substitute for &#8220;efforts by developing countries to achieve growth and improve human well-being.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Norway is not part of the European Union and therefore isn&rsquo;t its victim of mass immigration, Marxist multiculturalism, and financial manipulations.  I bet, if they don&rsquo;t change, it will still be #1 ten years from now.  Maybe even 100!<br>

		<p>I am just waiting for the typical Asian lovers on here (who usually secretly have Asian wives) to post on here about how this list is not accurate and how Japan and Korea should be at the very top.  This list just goes to show that Asians are NOT ALWAYS above us in every category.  Just something to think about.</p>

		<p>OK. Need I say the obvious: That, with the sole exception of Afghanistan-torn by constant bloody civil war by Islamic extremists-virtually ALL the bottom countries are in Black Africa. In addition, nearly all the top countries are not only White, but may be described as Anglo Saxon, or even Nordic. Hmmmm&hellip;any conection?</p>
<p>Oh, I know: &#8220;But it was only caused by the long years of European imperialism that held Africans down!&#8221; Hmmm, but Ireland, which suffered seven centuries of cruel expoitation by the English, is in fifth place! Better think up another argument, or excuse, for Black Africans.</p>

		<p>Something that has to be considered with this type of thing is the societal values.  I&rsquo;m in no way shape or form an &#8220;Asian lover&#8221; (if any I&rsquo;m a Hispanic-Lover which is inevitably more hated in this country).</p>
<p>It needs to be addressed that in the majority of Eastern cultures the focus is on the betterment of the society and not the indivudual; it seems inevitable this would decrease their &#8220;life&#8221; rating, however does it really make one less content if they&rsquo;re following their own value system faithfully?  I feel that despite our life expectancy and wealth, our soul would have more peace and really, to a pure individual this makes a higher quality of life. </p>
<p>But then who is pure anymore. And alas, we&rsquo;re back to the deterioration of the human race.</p>

<p>Not only that, but we can observe the Latin American countries ranked in rough accordance with their racial composition.  Only one past the 100th spot has any significant number of white people, Bolivia with its white elite of 10%.  The D.R. is listed as 15% white, but that seems very doubtful to me:</p>
<p>49. Argentina - 90% white<br>
50. Uruguay - 90% white<br>
51. Cuba - 65% white, 35% black/mulatto<br>
53. Mexico - 8% white, 90% mestizo<br>
54. Costa Rica - 95% white/mestizo<br>
58. Venezuela - 20% white, 70% mestizo<br>

75. Brazil - 50% white, 50% black<br>
77. Colombia - 20% white, 60% mestizo, 20% mulatto<br>

		<p>Earlier today I only saw the top 20 list on another site, but the other lists are priceless. Now I know that if I bring this list to the attention of any of the minorities in my office, they will harumph that the high percentage of White countries in the top 20 are the result of colonial oppression-Whitey living large on the resources of the 3rd world-but how do the race hustlers explain Finland, Iceland, Norway, and any other European country that never had colonial possessions? Or what about countries like Ireland that were colonial possessions?</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with the Asian representatives on the list-Japan, Singapore, HK, and the ROK in the very high group seems reasonable. Thailand Vietnam, Philippines, and China in the &#8216;medium&rsquo; group also looks right. Just reminded myself that the ROK was property of Japan until 1945 and Singapore and HK were British colonies!! So colonialism is not always negative I guess. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that so many former East Bloc countries are in the High Human Development despite suffering through decades of communism. </p>
<p>Hey! Where is Somalia? On the &#8216;very low&rsquo; list or the &#8216;no&rsquo; list?</p>

		<p>Courtney - I don&rsquo;t believe that Asians are above us in any category. The secret of their success in Western countries is their discipline and ambition, their kids study hard and try hard to succeed. Rebelling against your parents is not a common concept. All this is admirable. But the fact is that they are doing this in Western countries because their own countries are overcrowded, corrupt and lacking in equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>The traffic is one-way, who would live willingly in Korea or Japan, where the laws and customs are skewed against non-natives, instead of in Australia or Norway - or the US?</p>
<p>Asians in general(of course there are exceptions)are group thinkers and rote learners, they seem to have very little understanding of thinking outside the box, or of forming an original opinion. That&rsquo;s been my experience anyhow. And the Chinese stole, bought or were given their technology by the West. </p>
<p>The US is down on the list, in my opinion, because of the millions of non-European immigrants allowed in each year and the millions of illegals who bring their barbaric customs with them - eg, the sacrifice of small animals by South American and African cults. There is not one South American country listed in the first 48 countries, yet where do most illegals in the US come from?</p>

		<p>boy is this ever a no brainer. the whitest countries are the most desirable with the highest standard of living. it&rsquo;s interesting that a study was done with statistics to bear this out, though. and that the countries were graded.<br>
what on earth was teddy kennedy thinking when he backed &#8221;the immigration reform act of 1965&#8221;. i was a little too young to comprehend it, but he must have known it would change the &#8221;complection&#8221; of america&hellip;even as he reassured us in a speech that it wouldn&rsquo;t when he argued passionately for its passage so many years ago. this was the daggar in the heart of america that would doom us. he argued it would &#8221;not change the demographic&#8221; one iota. it did just that. by 2042 we will be a majority non-white country. thank you, teddy kennedy. <br>
maybe now that he&rsquo;s 6 feet under he can&rsquo;t sponsor any more destructive, liberal legislation that stabs in the back his fellow white countrymen.</p>

		<p>This list is &#8216;slightly&rsquo; skewed: many Arab and Muslim countries (Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Brunei, etc.) have high development indexes, but remember that for all of them, their wealth was TOTALLY unearned-due entirely to oil/natural gas.  These people haven&rsquo;t worked a day in their lives!  Malaysia is wealthy without oil-but only because the Chinese (aka NON-MUSLIM population) have created the wealth, NOT the lazy Muslim Malaysians. </p>

		<p>I was watching a TV program the other day about Africans attempting to reach Europe via the Sahara desert and Mediterranean sea. Despite the obvious perils and risk involved  with many facing death by drowning or dehydration in the desert the one thing that stuck in my mind was the<br>
desperation and determination of many of these African souls to make the journey and if sent back to try again.<br>
As the above survey suggests many of them seem to realize that mainly white Europe was a far better place to live and work compared to the miserable state of affairs in their own backward hell holes  and those who made it to Europe were feted as heroes.One cannot help feeling with skyrocketing bithrates in Africa along with worsening poverty,civil wars,disease  etc that Fortress Europe will come under further siege and the future is literally looking  blacker indeed!<br>
It was also interesting to note how it appears European countries appear to be bribing Libya to beef up its border security to prevent boatloads of mainly  African   asylum seekers reaching the Italian mainland. Desperate times call for desperate measures to fight off desperate people!          <br>

		<p>What is also remarkable about these lists is the fact that just about all those countries in the least developed category have been given millions of dollars in assistance, they&rsquo;ve been educated, fed, medicated, they&rsquo;ve had colonial governments (as did Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, NZ,America, Canada and they&rsquo;re not festering in poverty). These backward nations have had all those Oh so caring experts in the UN, World Bank and countless international organizations provide help and STILL they don&rsquo;t know how to build a well or a clinic. How many generations does it take to learn these basic skills?  <br>
 Is it time we consider that the leaders of these places, the Mugabes, Amin,Mandelas,Obotes etc. are actually the really clued-in guys, they know what we refuse to accept: that the majority of their people can&rsquo;t be taught, only organized and kept subject. These tyrants never been afraid to use force, fear and oppression to control their people, they did it for centuries before we arrived with our Western notions of fair play, compassion, tolerance and leniency.  We think we can educate these pitiful people to act like Westernized adults when all the evidence demonstrates that they won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t.  I don&rsquo;t like to see them suffer under their tyrannical leaders, but the West should start to rethink how to deal humanely with people who seem incapable of learning before they all decide to move en masse into our societies; the few who are here already are causing major disorder and chaos where they congregate and many still need to be helped. <br>
 In the past I would have said some kind of benevolent colonialism might be the answer, but I think we have missed our chance at that, and besides the isolationist in me thinks we should try and avoid overseas ventures.<br>
Arc.  <br>

I&rsquo;m really interested to know why a country like iceland (which is the whistest in the world) has has their economy wiped out. This surprises me. I thought a totally white country would not allow this to happen. Any ideas?</p>
<p>My guess is that the IMF (banking Leviathan) has them slated for monetary humiliation in order to gain greater control of government policies.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: <br>
&#8220;Take these non-contributing non-White people into your country or do without our fiscal blessings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Courtney, I do not come here to compare Korea to Western countries, or any other countries.  Of course I know very well that western countries offer the highest quality of life on the planet.  But anyways, as I grow older, I am starting to learn that comparison becomes less and less important.  I come here because I like reading the news and the comments.  I do not live my life to convince others &#8220;Korea is better than ___(insert a country here)____&#8221; Even on the list above, but of course, there is nothing wrong with being proud of your country and heritage like you are.  </p>
<p>And it is least of my interest to see any race on this world become extinct. My life is too short and I have much better things to do than that. I do not live my life to help other races become extinct. </p>

		<p>To those of you who are wondering about Zimbabwe, Somalia, North Korea and Iraq on this list - they are not ranked, because insufficient data are provided for several factors which would contribute to producing an overall score and ranking. Somalia and Zimbabwe have not provided enough data - I suspect because of collapse of government there. North Korea didn&rsquo;t release any due to the fact that it&rsquo;s a closed-off Stalinist state, and Iraq has a war going on, and so data for these rankings were not provided </p>

<p>That is an admirable sentiment. I fully agree with that, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone here would advocate anything otherwise. We are race realists, not haters.  We are race-preservers. We are pro-life and anti-genocide. We want to protect our own, but harm no one else.  Does that make us evil and &#8220;haters&#8221; of anyone who&rsquo;s different?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  Myself, I respect the differences. I encourage them.  Humanity is a large family tree. I don&rsquo;t want to kill off all the branches except my own!</p>
<p>One of the strangest ironies afoot in the world today is that the obsessive, thoughtless proponents of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; are actually the greatest enemies of that very diversity that they praise, because by scrambling all the races together in a muddy mélange, they will end by eliminating all the races.  That is hardly the way to advance &#8220;diversity&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the way to kill it.</p>
<p>If these silly people thought out their position fully to its logical end, they would see that mixing the races ultimately destroys diversity. Thus, those faddish fools who push for miscegenation are not really the friends of other races;  they are the enemies of ALL races.</p>
