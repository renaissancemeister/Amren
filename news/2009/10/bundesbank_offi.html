			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, London Telegraph, October 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dr Thilo Sarrazin, a member of the executive board and head of the bank&rsquo;s risk control operations, told Europe&rsquo;s culture magazine Lettre International that Turks with low IQs and poor child-rearing practices were &#8220;conquering Germany&#8221; by breeding two or three times as fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;A large number of Arabs and Turks in this city, whose number has grown through bad policies, have no productive function other than as fruit and vegetable vendors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty per cent of all births occur in the underclasses. Our educated population is becoming stupider from generation to generation. What&rsquo;s more, they cultivate an aggressive and atavistic mentality. It&rsquo;s a scandal that Turkish boys won&rsquo;t listen to female teachers because that is what their culture tells them&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d rather have East European Jews with an IQ that is 15pc higher than the German population,&#8221; he said</p>
<p>Dr Sarrazin has since apologised but his comments may have breached Germany&rsquo;s anti-racism laws. The Bundesbank&rsquo;s staff union said over the weekend that his position had become &#8220;untenable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bundesbank chief Axel Weber found himself caught in the storm while attending the G7 summit in Istanbul, where Turkish newspapers have been in uproar. He was provided with bodyguards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bundesbank is an institution held in high esteem in Germany. I see that a loss of reputation has arisen here,&#8221; he said. Every member of the Bundesbank from chauffeur to cashier must look into their own conscience and judge themselves if they breach the bank&rsquo;s moral code, Mr Weber said. However, he may be in some difficulty himself if the Süddeutschen Zeitung is correct in reporting that he approved the Sarrizin interview after calling for certain changes.</p>
<p>The dispute has overshadowed Mr Weber&rsquo;s warnings to Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s new coalition that Germany cannot afford years of loose fiscal policy. The budget deficit is already 6pc of GDP, yet the pro-business Free Democrats are pushing for tax cuts of almost €50bn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is very little room to reduce the tax burden on citizens unless spending is cut,&#8221; he said. The Bundesbank has long argued that the key to raising growth rates is by structural reform.<br>

		<p>I live in Germany: most Germans agree with what Sarrazin said, because its all true.</p>
<p>The Turkish population in Germany has increased 4-fold while the number of Turks WORKING here has stayed the same.</p>
<p>Who are the others?? Large families on welfare whose children CANNOT learn.</p>
<p>The average German Turk has an IQ around 85 - ca 20 points below the average German: they are simply not competitive. </p>

		<p>No surprises here. The so-called Bundesrepublik Deutschland is functionally a Marxist state with some concessions for economic freedom. It&rsquo;s interesting that even Mr. Sarrazin&rsquo;s complimentary (and empirically accurate) remarks about East European Jews don&rsquo;t even seem to be enough to protect him.</p>
<p>If the EU Constitution comes into full effect (as seems most probable after the Irish referendum results), we can expect even worse policies from Germany, and from other member states as well.</p>
<p>I think European civilization is now pretty much history. Maybe the former colonies can conserve what remains of it.</p>

		<p>At first I was thinking, how long is it until we get similar racism speech laws here in the US.  Then I thought, well I guess we already have them, they&rsquo;re just unwritten.  Remember Trent Lott?</p>
<p>Any rate, I&rsquo;ve gathered it is a majority feeling among Germans that too many Turks have been emigrated into Germany despite there being no jobs for them.  Or maybe they&rsquo;re unskilled or stupid or whatever.  I&rsquo;ve talked with Germans at my school and also a friend that went over for a year and they all say how unintegrated the Turks are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think its quite as bad as Britain though.  Maybe due to Germany being bigger and more room to spread like us in the states.  If you haven&rsquo;t, listen to the BNP chairman&rsquo;s speech on the Enoch Powell River of Blood aniversary.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhi-n7rGzS8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhi-n7rGzS8</a>     (3 Parts)<br>
Great fun.  He talks about the stability of multicultural societies in our financial disaster.</p>
<p>If there are any English out there, why is the BBC doing a 180 on their norm of just blaming the white man?  Hopefully whenever the time comes when whites permit themselves the luxury of freedom of association, the lefties are still around to be strung up.  They&rsquo;ve made the society with the most productive people and highest quality of life ever seen, sick and I want to say suicidal.  </p>

		<p>Some 14 years ago, I once read in a book written by a psychic describing the destruction of Europe.  She described living conditions similar to Africa.  At that time, I found it hard to believe but it appears perhaps her predictions might be true.  Perhaps, eventually the only advanced civilzation left on this planet might be in China/Japan  &mdash;  representing the true yellow race.  The white race is extremely busy destroying itself under some self created righteous delusions.  Pure suicide is to interbreed with inferior genes which the younger white generation is constantly brain washed to do.     </p>

		<p>&#8216;Good people&rsquo; everywhere, stop calling them &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; laws. They are anti-white laws. The proof of that is that declaring bad things about whites, doesn&rsquo;t get one hauled before a sensitivity tribunal, but wins one awards and accolades. Saying bad things about non-whites is &#8216;racism&rsquo; and so too it is considered racism Not saying the properly derogatory things about white folks. I think that&rsquo;s called you lose no matter what. Have to keep the public off balance so more and more can be imported. Everyone must experience &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>

<p>These people have no intention of being &#8220;competitive&#8221; what they intend is to increase their numbers until there are enough of them to challenge the lawful government and then the WILL challenge the government.

But, even so,  would you WANT them to be competive? <br>
The bottom line is that you don&rsquo;t really need them living among you, living OFF you&hellip;   nor do you need them living among you and competing WITH you.  Germany just doesn&rsquo;t need them at all.</p>

		<p>Not only the Turks, almost all foreigners in Germany -despite being mostly white or Caucasian- are extremely incompetent. Most of them (including Germans from Russia and Eastern Europe) speak poorly German and simply not educated. While the Turks and Italians (mostly Southern/Sicilian) work in restaurants, factory and construction workers are made up by Eastern Europeans.</p>
<p>And not only the Turks are becoming stupid. Thanks to the very inefficient education system, the gap between Germans and non-Germans is closing (in the negative direction, of course).</p>

		<p>I am currently studying in Germany, and I have previously studied in Turkey. I attended a lecture recently where the professor presented some liberal rhetoric about Germany being the least immigrant friendly, specifically in that immigrants have no chances of attending a university. WHAT ARE EUROPEANS THINKING? The same goes for my US University faculty. Whether here in Germany or back home, we are feeling some inexplicable need to help races that don&rsquo;t want to helped. They just want handouts. Meanwhile I am earning a degree from a liberal university that means nothing because the non-white students bring down the university&rsquo;s testing rates. </p>

		<p>Here Germans are being duplicitous, as are so many Americans. The Turks are &#8220;conquering Germany&#8221;. The Mexicans are &#8220;conquering America&#8221;,etc. While both of these statements seem evident,what do both the Germans and Americans have in common with their concerns over being conquered by foreign cultures??</p>
<p>ANSWER: Both of them won&rsquo;t do a damn thing about it. Can anyone feel sorry for people who claim to be heading toward a state of ruin, and yet, BEING PERFECTLY SOUND IN BODY AND MIND, allow it to happen without BARELY LIFTING A FINGER? Aren&rsquo;t these types of behavior often characterized by folk wisdom,such as,you will sleep in the bed you made, the Lord helps those who help themselves(just look at Congress,haha..)etc.?</p>

<p>I have to agree, Ive never been to a more insane, upside down world in my life than Germnay. I have spent nearly 16 months living in Europe, with extensive time in Germany, and am thoughoughly discusted with Europeans, to the core of me. Even regular White collar Whites back in the States who lean liberal, would be considered the most racist rightist&rsquo;s in this zoo. Europe should be the greatest example to all True White Americans to defend thier unique culture at all costs! Since WW2, and the success of Marxism, and the Frankfurt school of thought in Europe, we have a social experement gone bad in Europe, horribly bad.<br>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I think the underlying problem is that we are frozen into a traditional pattern of thinking in which all conquests, for thousands of years, have always come about violently or militarily by armies or raiders from outside.  Hence, our country is bristling with defensive weaponry that is designed to forestall a military attack.   A military conquest of the USA would be out of the question.  Impossible. But we are totally unequipped and unprepared to deal with a gradual, creeping conquest by fruit pickers and hotel maids FROM WITHIN.  Nor are we dealing at all with the demographic conquest by their anchor babies who will soon outnumber our own. </p>
<p>This  challenge calls for a new approach. Our military and government thinking has not kept up with the new realities of the automobile and the jet age. We have built a network of superb superhighways which have simply made it easier for aliens to invade us and penetrate into every remotest little nook of the country. We have built airports and designed wonderful airplanes that carry hundreds, all undreamt of a century ago, which have had the same effect   &mdash;    to make us easier to invade.  Now, they can fly straight into the heart of the country   &mdash;   Dallas, Denver, Chicago,  Minneapolis   &mdash;   not even going through customs at an ocean port.   We have developed vaccines, wonder drugs, and genetically-engineered seeds that have enabled the Third World to multiply at an unprecedented rate   &mdash;    and dump their surplus population on us. These inventions of ours have backfired!  Such a result was never expected.</p>
<p>Our traditional  government/military thinking remains basically what it was in the age of Napoleon, with the addition of nuclear weapons and airpower.  But they are useless against anchor babies.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, while we have not updated our national security strategies,  <b>the Third World has discovered a new form of conquest:  demographics!  </b> </p>
<p>This new conquest is being won in the maternity wards of hospitals, not on the battlefields. And we are doing nothing about it. Our officials don&rsquo;t even dare recognize it. They are silenced by the fear of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  I cannot stress enough that this new conquest (which is succeeding) is  <i>DEMOGRAPHIC, </i> not   <i>MILITARY.   </i>  It is essential that we understand this.  Those of our officials charged with guarding and preserving  this country <b><i>&#8220;for ourselves and our posterity&#8221;</i></b> had better wake up and bring their strategy up to date. So far, they are failing in their duties.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t agree with you more! </p>
<p>A German acquaintance in Frankfurt nervously admitted to me that he was concerned about <b><i>&#8220;young, radical&#8221;  </i></b>Moslems. He was reluctant even to say this much.  But he was very careful to make it clear that his concern was ONLY religious, not racial, and ONLY with extremists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s not going to be good enough to save them. The Trojan horse is within the gates.</p>

		<p>I am sure that when the Turks started arriving there were Germans who thought that they would learn the culture, improve themselves and fit in. Those Germans discounted any threat an unassimilable population might pose. With increasing number of Turks in Germany, it is even easier for the Turks to form a nation within a nation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am sure that when the Turks started arriving there were Germans who thought that they would learn the culture, improve themselves and fit in.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Actually, they were called &#8220;Guest Workers&#8221; [Gastarbeiter] and were assumed to be  there only temporarily, and  then would return home. Nobody expected they would settle down and become permanent. But after living in Germany, who would want to return to Turkey?   Unfortunately, there was no time limit set, and that was the flaw.</p>

		<p>ghw#22  No doubt you&rsquo;ve made some veritable observations,anchor babies are a new technique in conquest, ect. But isn&rsquo;t nature always mutating to some degree? Nature is dynamic and fluid, not hermetically sealed constructs. Yesturdays technology made it impractical to have such a mobile populace. It is the white mans inventions that have changed this,.. more than any other factor,.. correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. The unnexpected implications of innovations goes back to Pandoras box and it was us who opened it then, too. Consequently white nations may exist more in floating groups of similar genotype than entire geographic locations in this new paradigm. The future is always up for grabs otherize it wouldn&rsquo;t be alive.</p>

<p>Or as someone else once said here: &#8220;You cannot have a welfare state without building an impregnable wall around it.&#8221;</p>
