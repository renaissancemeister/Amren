<h1>Struggling With Status of Undocumented Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carisa Chappell, Community College Times, September 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>States aren&rsquo;t sure what to do about the issue of undocumented immigrants. It&rsquo;s become especially controversial in places like North Carolina, where during the last eight years, the state community college system has changed its mind four times regarding whether to allow undocumented students to enroll at its institutions.</p>
<p>In 2001, the system prohibited undocumented immigrants from enrolling. In 2004, it allowed each college to decide. In 2007, all community colleges were mandated to admit undocumented students. But that was reversed last year when the system prohibited its member colleges from enrolling undocumented students into degree-granting programs.</p>
<p>Last week, system officials changed their minds again, allowing undocumented immigrants to enroll in classes, as long as they have graduated from a U.S. high school.</p>
<p>North Carolina is not alone in the quandary about how to handle the dilemma, and states vary in their approaches, said Teresita Wisell, director of the Community College Consortium for Immigrant Education (CCCIE).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Currently, 10 states  &mdash;  including states with large immigrant populations, such as California, Illinois, New Mexico, New York and Texas  &mdash;  allow undocumented immigrants to attend college at in-state tuition levels if they meet certain conditions, Wisell noted Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Virginia charge undocumented immigrants out-of-state tuition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other extreme is those states that do not allow undocumented student to enroll in community colleges at all,&#8221; Wisell said.</p>
<p>About two years ago, Arizona passed a law denying in-state college tuition and other state funded benefits to illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>As a result more than 3,400 community college students and close to 300 university students paid the higher non-resident tuition rate because they couldn&rsquo;t prove their legal status. Proponents of the law argue that the extra tuition money is helping colleges to offer more programs and services, while opponents contend that the higher tuition cost is preventing thousands of potentially undocumented immigrants from enrolling. Opponents add that the law is also hurting the state economically, as many industries are scrambling to find skilled workers to replace retiring baby boomers. Many of these jobs could be filled if undocumented immigrants could afford the required training at community colleges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Should the Dream Act pass, then enrollment in college becomes a clear avenue to conditional residency and subsequently citizenship,&#8221; said Wisell, adding it might provide for a more consistent policy across states.</p>
<p>However, proponents of the bill haven&rsquo;t been able to muster the votes in Congress needed to pass it.</p>
<p>Several organizations, such as CCCIE, are working to educate the public on the legislation. Wisell said that the consortium, which was founded last year, will focus on raising awareness about immigrants at community colleges and the challenges they face, creating a vehicle for promising practices to be shared and partnering with other organizations to create an understanding of the issues around credentialing and licensing for skilled immigrants who&rsquo;ve been educated or trained outside of the U.S.</p>

		<p>Commnunity colleges lost their way a long time ago.  Many have failed to honor their original commitment to provide educational and vocational training to supply a workforce for local communities.  Instead they have become &#8220;feeder&#8221; schools for 4 yr colleges and universities.  As a result, they are desperate to admit anyone and everyone, regardless of whether the prospective student can read, much less comprehend, college level coursework. Admitting illegals allows them to meet their admission quotas- they do not care if the produce graduates.  </p>

		<p>States not sure what to do about it?????  This is outrageous!  When the illegals sign-up for classes, they should be detained until federal immigration officers arrive to arrest and deport them for being in the country illegally.</p>

		<p>All the community colleges need to do is charge illegal aliens out-of-state tuition, which is very high even for community colleges.  This will prevent nearly all of them from attending the college except those who are willing to spend A LOT of money, which would actually work to subsidize the education of low-income American citizens.</p>

		<p>In-state tuition for illegals is a complete shame.  They should be charged the same as international students are, if admitted at all.  After all, they are foreigners, right?</p>

		<p>This is so insane &amp; corrupt: how is it right that a foreign student, duly charged out of state tuition, would get a better deal on tuition if he had just sneaked illegally into the country and got the instate rates as an illegal at taxpayer expense?</p>
<p>Too many of our politicians are just corrupt and fail to do their duty to citizens. The would rather cater to the Mexican vote.  </p>

		<p>How&rsquo;s this sound. Let them enroll, let them pay, get their address, ICE rounds them up and ships them out.</p>
<p>Is it really that difficult?</p>

		<p>What is the problem? There is a key word here, &#8220;illegal&#8221;! If the people in charge can not figure it out, sounds like they need replaced!</p>

		<p>Two thoughts for confused journalists such as Ms. Chappell:</p>
<p>First, most illegal immigrants in this countryy are not &#8220;undocumented.&#8221;  Many have documents, though often forged.  </p>
<p>Second, with or without the euphemism &#8220;undocumented,&#8221; those here illegally should be deported.  Nothing too complicated here.  </p>

		<p>Community colleges don&rsquo;t know what to do? How about following the law, for starters.</p>

		<p>Question for admission test to local Community College;<br>
If I am in state, I get charged a discounted tuition.<br>
If I am out of state, I get charged a large tuition.  <br>
But if I am out of the country, and here illegally I get charged less.<br>
- Compare and contrast the advantages of being an out-of-state US citizen with that of and an in-state illegal.<br>
- Illegally exactly how do you claim you are a resident of a certain state?  Why can&rsquo;t a US citizen from out of state, currently moving into the state, claim that they are a resident of the more advantageous state?</p>
