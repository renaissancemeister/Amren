<h1><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=email_en&amp;sid=a6QpSf.s4NaA">Armageddon in Alabama Proves Parable for Local U.S. Governments</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Wells, Bloomberg, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In its 190-year history, Jefferson County, Alabama, has endured a cholera epidemic, a pounding in the Civil War, gunslingers, labor riots and terrorism by the Ku Klux Klan. Now this namesake of Thomas Jefferson, anchored by Birmingham, is staring at what one local politician calls financial &#8220;Armageddon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spectacle  &mdash;  a tax struck down, about 1,000 county employees furloughed, a politician indicted over $3 billion in sewer debt that may lead to the largest municipal bankruptcy in history  &mdash;  has elbowed its way up the ladder of county lore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One target of their anger is Larry P. Langford, who was the county commission&rsquo;s president in 2003 and 2004 and is now mayor of Birmingham. The 61-year-old Democrat goes on trial today, charged in a November 2008 federal indictment with taking cash, Rolex watches and designer clothes in exchange for helping to steer $7.1 million in fees to an Alabama investment banker as the county refinanced its sewer debt.</p>
<p>Jefferson County&rsquo;s debacle is a parable for billions of dollars lost by state and local governments from Florida to California in transactions done behind closed doors. Selling debt without requiring competition made public officials vulnerable to bankers&rsquo; sales pitches, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill for borrowing gone awry.</p>
<p>Swaps Blew Up</p>
<p>Under Langford&rsquo;s stewardship, the county bet on interest-rate swaps, agreements that a representative of New York-based JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. told commissioners could reduce their interest costs. Instead, the swaps  &mdash;  covering more than $5 billion in all  &mdash;  blew up during the credit crisis after ratings for the county&rsquo;s bond insurers fell.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thousands of public borrowers across the U.S. chose a similar strategy, and many are now paying billions of dollars to escape the contracts, said Peter Shapiro, managing director at Swap Financial Group in South Orange, New Jersey. Even Harvard University, the world&rsquo;s richest academic institution with an endowment of $26 billion, fell for Wall Street&rsquo;s financing in the dark: It paid $497.6 million to investment banks during the fiscal year ended June 30 because it chose to cancel $1.1 billion of interest-rate swaps.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jefferson County&rsquo;s collapse shows how people calling themselves financial engineers created borrowing schemes in the $2.8 trillion municipal-bond market that incorporated risk without the benefits of transparency. As state and local governments embraced floating-rate debt and interest-rate swaps, or agreements to exchange periodic interest payments with banks or insurers, they stopped requiring competition in bond sales.</p>
<p>No-Bid Sales</p>
<p>Less than 15 percent of $391 billion in new debt offerings were sold last year on the basis of public bidding  &mdash;  down from 83 percent of new sales in 1970. Most issues are now negotiated, meaning borrowing costs are set in private bargaining sessions.</p>
<p>In Jefferson County, the resulting opacity was a gateway to corruption, according to documents filed in Langford&rsquo;s case. The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission began probing the county&rsquo;s swaps in 2004; the Federal Bureau of Investigation started inquiring later. In June 2007, SEC investigators deposed Langford in Miami about whether he used the sewer-debt refinancings to pay off political friends.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators&rsquo; interest in Langford didn&rsquo;t stop him from running for mayor of Birmingham in 2007. He leveraged a pro-business message with a vow to repave streets and clean up neighborhoods into an October victory over the incumbent and eight other challengers.</p>
<p>Thirteen months into his term, he was named in a 101-count indictment and led into federal district court in leg irons.</p>
<p>After Langford&rsquo;s departure from the commission, its financial troubles deepened. A state court last January struck down an occupational tax that accounted for 25 percent of the county&rsquo;s operating revenue, setting the stage for massive service cuts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;In a Heartbeat&rsquo;</p>
<p>Friends and foes say his political stock remains strong in Birmingham. He would &#8220;win in a heartbeat&#8221; if an election were called tomorrow, says Patricia Todd, a Democratic state legislator whose district lies partly in the city of 229,000.</p>
<p>In Jefferson County&rsquo;s bedroom communities, some are seething over Langford&rsquo;s role in the sewer-bond crisis and the county&rsquo;s financial woes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s a pure idiot,&#8221; says David King, a pharmacist from Vestavia Hills, a town of 25,000 about six miles south of Birmingham.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July and August, Langford&rsquo;s two co-defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for the prosecution. William B. Blount, a Montgomery investment banker and former chairman of the state Democratic party, and Albert W. LaPierre, a Birmingham lobbyist, admitted to taking part in a scheme to bribe Langford to get bond and interest-rate swaps business.</p>
<p>&#8216;Political Witch Hunt&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unbowed, the bespectacled, mustachioed Langford, known for tailored suits, oratorical flourishes and frequent evocations of his Christian religion, has declared his innocence, denouncing the charges against him as &#8220;a political witch hunt.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not Safe</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s story shows what can happen when creative financing meets old-school thinking, he [Richard A. Ciccarone, director of research at McDonnell Investment Management,] says.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always hear that sewer and water-service bonds are safe,&#8221; Ciccarone said. &#8220;This is a good example of how that&rsquo;s just not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lines Form</p>
<p>Lines soon formed outside the courthouse as such tasks as renewing driver&rsquo;s licenses slowed.</p>
<p>A kind of legal civil war broke out when three county agencies, the sheriff&rsquo;s department, an indigent-care hospital and the tax-assessor&rsquo;s office, sued the county commission to stop the budget cuts on the grounds that they posed a danger to public safety.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fight over the occupational tax, a 0.50 percent levy on personal income, dates to 1999 when state lawmakers repealed it. The county appealed that action and won a series of state court decisions until January when a judge ruled the repeal was legal.</p>
<p>That left county leaders to find $75 million in cuts while they took the case to the Alabama Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court&rsquo;s ruling in August. In parallel action, the state legislature reauthorized a modified version of the tax at a lower rate, 0.45 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Langford, who rose from public housing in Birmingham&rsquo;s Titusville neighborhood to its mayor&rsquo;s office, is at the eye of Jefferson County&rsquo;s storm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political Career Begins</p>
<p>His political career began in 1977, when he won a Birmingham City Council post. In 1988, he was elected mayor of Fairfield, a suburb of 11,300 about nine miles southwest of the county seat. He studied at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government during 2000 and in 2002 ran for the county commission.</p>
<p>His October 2007 Birmingham mayoral victory was powered largely by his popularity among the city&rsquo;s 74 percent black majority. Once elected with 50.3 percent of the vote, &#8220;he had a lot of white corporate leaders who were quickly at his side currying his support,&#8221; says Robert G. Corley, a Birmingham native and director of UAB&rsquo;s Global and Community Leadership Honors Program. &#8220;And in many ways he&rsquo;s delivered on key projects that they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Theory of the Deal</p>
<p>Under the deal, the county would pay JPMorgan a fixed rate in return for receiving floating-rate payments from the bank. In theory, the payments to the county would match its debt obligations, leaving its swap payments to the bank as the county&rsquo;s only cost.</p>
<p>In 2003 and 2004, with Langford as president, the commission plunged into interest-rate swaps with JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos., Bank of America Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Over time, the county, whose fiscal 2010 operating budget is $808.6 million, entered swaps on more than $5 billion in bonds.</p>
<p>Langford said in 2005 that the swaps would save $214 million  &mdash;  an assumption based on the county and its bond insurers maintaining their credit ratings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal Investigations</p>
<p>JPMorgan disclosed in May that the SEC is investigating the bank&rsquo;s role in selling the financing structure to the county. The regulatory agency, along with the U.S. Justice Department, is also conducting a nationwide investigation into alleged bid-rigging or collusion in the sale of &#8220;municipal derivatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Langford, he &#8220;sold out his public office to his friends Blount and LaPierre for about $235,000 in clothes, watches and cash to pay his growing personal debt,&#8221; said a Department of Justice press release that accompanied the unsealing of his indictment in December. Of more than $7 million in fees Blount allegedly received, he kicked back $371,932 to LaPierre, according to federal documents in the case.</p>
<p>In one instance, Langford demanded $69,000 &#8220;to influence and reward him in connection with Jefferson County financial transactions,&#8221; according to a July 29 plea agreement LaPierre filed in Birmingham federal district court. In June 2003, Blount wrote a $69,000 check to LaPierre who, three days later, wrote a $69,000 check to Langford, according to the agreement.</p>
<p>Upscale Clothier</p>
<p>Between May and November 2004, Blount and LaPierre  &mdash;  using checks and American Express cards  &mdash;  spent $12,000 on clothing and luxury goods for Langford at Remon&rsquo;s Clothier, an upscale Birmingham retailer, the government alleges.</p>

<p>It is expected that many more local jurisdictions will be laying off vital services such as police, firefighters, as well as teachers, road workers and other public employees.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also many who are right now laying off, and several governments are raising the question as to whether or not they will be able to honor pensions.  My educated guess is that they will not.  Much chaos is in store for us before we finally hit bottom.</p>
<p>Better to have a devestated country than a multicultural mess of people who hate whites, their traditions, their history and their heroes.  The coming 2010 is going to be a prelude of fiercer things to come in 2011-2012. It will be bad enough in itself, but serving as a coming attractions of one sort or another it will frighten many people, especially the crooks in power.</p>

		<p>These black managed regions of America are beginning to really seem like they were excized right out of Zimbabwe or SA and set into the American landscape.  And here we are with a black president, who currently seems to be hiding out somewhere in the White House, trying to figure out how to get out of another one of the dozens of impossible promises he made during his campaign that was eaten up by a generation of computer nerds and aged hippy-reformers.</p>

		<p>This article keeps talking about municipal bankruptcy&hellip;.yet it is about a county in Alabama. There is no municipal bankruptcy&hellip;.it is a county.</p>
<p>Alabama already made a US Supreme Court decision about this already, back during the great depression. The City of Mobile, Alabama had financial trouble so the State of Alabama reissued the city charter as the Port of Mobile, to shed a few creditors and bond holders in the process. The Supreme Court ruled against the State of Alabama.<br>

		<p>Birmingham was the place where I had my racial awakening.  It&rsquo;s truly a shame what has happened to the place, but Birmingham also clearly demonstrates what happens when  blacks are in charge. I&rsquo;ve never lived in a filthier and more crime ridden place.  And I am originally from New York City! Anyway, unfortunately blacks just can&rsquo;t plan longterm, nor capusalate or carry out a vision. Instead they just tend to blight everything they touch.  Then they wonder why we don&rsquo;t want to live around them.  </p>

		<p>Predictable! But then how many truly honest Black politicians can you find? Politicians nearly always are self-serving crooks. Granted there are some honest ones, but those are few and far between. Houston had its own scandals&hellip; with Black mayor H. Lee Brown&hellip; when Black city officials were buying property earmarked for road expansion and selling those properties to the city at inflated prices.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m from north Jersey, and I lived just outside Birmingham for about seven-months.  Spending time in the crime ridden slum that is Birmingham helped wash the away the last residue of liberal education I received as an undergrad.  I had black friends who worked for the city, and I heard shady dealings going on  &mdash;  salaries paid with phony contracts, ects.  Mayor Langord&rsquo;s indictement may be seen as a positive by some, but the reality is that the new blacks taking over will be equally corrupt and inept at their responsibilities.  It&rsquo;s hard to enough to find a semi-reliable white person to take office let alone a black.  Birmingham is Black America  &mdash;  and an example of what can be expected from black governance  &mdash;  as the whole of America will soon learn the hard way.                </p>

		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Langford who got Jefferson County into this awful mess, there were quite a few others over the past several years, who are now serving time, or under indictment.  He is just one of the ones in a long list who got caught up in the greed of it all.  Jefferson County needs to just go ahead and declare bankruptcy, and start over with a whole new county commission.<br>
  <br>
Birmingham, however, is doing not too badly, financially, comparatively speaking.  Langford likes to keep throwing out ideas, and getting angry at the City Council who have to reign him in, saying they just want to keep Birmingham in the past, when in reality, they just want to keep Birmingham in the black, no pun intended.  He has an idea a day, and some are good, most are outrageous.  You can tell he wants to make his mark on Birmingham, and leave some sort of legacy.  I just don&rsquo;t think this is what he had in mind, to be found out in his corruption. It&rsquo;s a shame, too, because we got rid of Richard Arrington, and later, Bernard Kincaid.  Two of the worst mayors, especially Arrington, that I think Birmingham has ever seen.   Arrington was so corrupt, and so powerful politically, that when the feds were seeking to take him down, the word came straight from the white house to lay off.   And now, Arrington after 20 years of being a bad mayor, and spending years out of politics, has reared his ugly head to get into the mayors race again for a comeback.  He hates the police, as mayor, saying they were not worth getting needed raises, and allowing his very horrible daughter, Erica, to run rampant and cause havoc within the police department.  I just hope the people of this city don&rsquo;t buy into his garbage, because as nuts as Langford is, Arrington is a worse black politician by far.  Plus, if he hires another black crook, Donald Watkins, what a fiasco.  That guy and Arrington both got so enriched by their stints in Birmingham politics, they were going to go into some sort of overseas banking venture or something.  On a mayor&rsquo;s and lawyer&rsquo;s salaries??  Once we let them in, we let go of all sense.  Surely they won&rsquo;t do THAT again!!!<br>
They are all just poised, waiting for LL to go to prison&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I read an article about that fiasco some time ago in an earlier article in Bloomberg.  Here&rsquo;s some detail you may not know.</p>
<p>The usual thing a government entity does when it needs money for a major infrastructure project is issue fixed rate bonds.  This is simple and straightforward, the goal is to find an underwriter who can sell the bonds at the lowest possible rate.  The costs for future years are known exactly, right down to the penny, so you can budget accordingly.  At a time when interest rates are near historical lows, as they have been for a number of years, this is the obvious thing to do.</p>
<p>But in Jefferson County they had to get fancy.  They figured they could get a slightly lower rate, at least initially, by issuing variable rate bonds, with the rate tied to some index like LIBOR.  The problem with variable rate bonds is that you now have interest rate risk   &mdash;   your expenses could mount drastically as interest rates go up.  That leads to the need to hedge the bond with an interest rate swap.  An interest rate swap works like this:  Party A and party B pretend to borrow an equal amount of money from each other.  They then pay each other interest on the principal &#8220;owed&#8221;.  Party A pays a fixed rate to B and party B pays a variable rate to A.  While the principal amounts are imaginary the interest rate payments are real.  If you sell a variable rate bond you hedge it by entering into a swap agreement where you pay some third party a fixed rate and he pays you a variable rate.  So if rates go up you have to pay more interest to the bond holders but are compensated by getting more money from the counter party to the swap agreement.  You have to pay up front fees for the swap agreement so you may well imagine that by the time you&rsquo;ve worked out all the expenses you&rsquo;d be better off with a simple fixed rate bond.  That is in fact the case, 99% of the time.  Wall Street likes to push the more complex deals because they make more money from them.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the good part:  The interest rate swap that Jefferson County entered into actually required that Jefferson County pay the variable rate side while the counter party paid the fixed rate side.  So it wasn&rsquo;t a hedge at all.  At first, when LIBOR was low, Jefferson County received more money than it paid, but when LIBOR went up Jefferson County had to pay higher interest to the bond holders <i>and</i> higher payments to the counter party in the swap.  With some simple 6th grade algebra you could easily calculate the rate for LIBOR at which the swap agreement would become a liability.  I don&rsquo;t recall the value, but it was a low number that was well within the historical range.  So not only is Langford corrupt, he (and other financial wizards working in county government) apparently can&rsquo;t do elementary algebra.</p>
