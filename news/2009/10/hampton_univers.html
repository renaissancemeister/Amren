			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of London, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cultural history will be made tonight in a college town in southern Virginia when a lissome 22-year-old student in a tiara hosts a car show and singing contest modelled on American Idol. Nikole Churchill will look good, and on the evidence of the past few days will handle the microphone with aplomb.</p>
<p>However, she will have to be ready for hecklers. She is the first non-black Homecoming Queen in her university&rsquo;s history and not everyone is happy that she won the title. Her victory this month triggered a beauty pageant walkout and veiled accusations of black racism from the aggrieved new Miss Hampton University. She also wrote a long public letter to President Obama, saying: &#8220;I feel as though you could relate to my situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hampton University, at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, is one of more than 80 historically black colleges in the US whose student populations are only gradually coming to reflect the diversity they exist to promote, largely because non-blacks have been slow to apply to them.</p>
<p>Ms Churchill was hardly known to the university&rsquo;s main student body until she made the shortlist of ten contestants for a title that involves a year of public duties. A panel of five judges named her the winner after a two-hour pageant in which she spoke of the importance of mentoring girls on self-esteem and &#8220;body image&#8221;, and performed a Hawaiian hula in a pink-and-white swimsuit.</p>
<p>The other nine contestants were black. Two of them wore scowls rather than smiles for the traditional portraits of winner and runners-up and as the pictures were being taken, several dozen spectators walked out of the university&rsquo;s main auditorium. The following day Ms Churchill was heckled at a college football game and a previous Miss Hampton University said she was &#8220;very shocked&#8221; there was a white winner. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve never had one before,&#8221; Patrece Parson said.</p>
<p>Ms Churchill, whose father is from Guam, was sufficiently offended to write to President Obama, whose mother settled in Hawaii. &#8220;I am sad to say that my crowning was not widely accepted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the true reason for the disapproval was because of the colour of my skin. I am not African-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she was honoured to have been nicknamed &#8220;Lil Obama&#8221;, and invited the President to visit the university to help to spread some &#8220;aloha spirit&#8221; around the campus. Mr Obama has not responded, but fellow students have, bridling at the notion that Ms Churchill and the President have something in common. Brittany Riddock, a second-year student, told The Washington Post there was &#8220;no comparison between a black man becoming President and a white woman winning a beauty pageant at a black school&#8221;.</p>
<p>The president of the university&rsquo;s student body summoned Ms Churchill to explain herself onstage at a special meeting in the student centre theatre. She took the opportunity to apologise and thank the majority of students for their support.</p>
<p>She will need it. As the leader of an all-black &#8220;court&#8221; of runners-up and would-be beauty queens, she must host a fashion show tomorrow and be sworn in at a full-blown coronation on Wednesday. She may find, as a columnist in the neighbouring Newport News wrote, that her skin &#8220;isn&rsquo;t too white, but too thin&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The fact is that I do not think Blacks and other non-Whites should be in White beauty pageants. I think that many of my fellow AMRENERS would agree. </p>
<p>This being said, I can understand why many of the Black students are reacting the way they are. I feel the same way. I think that most of us would.</p>

		<p> Yes, couple of de sistuhs be lookin&rsquo; kinda glum in the photo. Ample proof that blacks can be just as racist as Whites (was there ever any doubt in our minds?) And why on earth should Ms. Churchill have to &#8220;apologize&#8221; for anything? THEY should be apologizing to HER for acting the way they have at her election.</p>

		<p>Does anybody know of anyone who has personal associations with blacks who doesn&rsquo;t somehow get burned by them eventually, involving race?</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>No white should EVER have anything to do with blacks except what is forced on him/her.</p>

<p>What an idiot. Brittany Riddock is apparently too stupid to figure out that the analogy Nikole Churchill made was that both she and president Obama experienced bad treatment because of their race. With such stupidity I can&rsquo;t see how this angry black girl was able to make it through high school, much less get into college.</p>
<p>All through out Europe and America, I keep seeing non-white women winning national beauty contests. Undoubtedly, they were chosen because they were not white, not because of their beauty. So now a white woman legitimately wins a beauty contests - and no, she was not a token choice like all the countless minorities who always win in national beauty contests in Europe and America - and the blacks can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>Boo hoo - she won fair and square. Get over it, you cry-babies.</p>

<p>When she&rsquo;s saying there&rsquo;s no comparison, I think she&rsquo;s trying to say the president of the united states suffers more than a lowely student. Being a student only allows one so much opportunity to suffer. Not too much opportunity for a peace prize there. </p>

		<p>Here is my vision of how this story will play out:</p>
<p>Ms Churchill will have a few black friends who will ostensibly take her side. However, they will let it be known in various subtle ways that they really think it was wrong for her to accept the prize, or even to enter the pageant in the first place. Blacks do stick together, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Ms Churchill will get a form letter from the White House, if anything at all.</p>
<p>The sudden cold shoulder and ostracism she gets from her black schoolmates at the university will become intense. She will then either transfer to a different school, or she will renounce the prize and apologize for her &#8220;racist ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just my prediction. It will be interesting to see if I&rsquo;m right.</p>

<p>Oh really, well just imagine if she were Black and Whites heckled her or walked out at her crowning? Would this newspaper columnist say she was thin-skinned? No way, they&rsquo;d be on her side saying she was a victim of racism and rightfully angry.<br>

<p>I would not be so quick to assume that she&rsquo;s non-white. Guam was for centuries an important mid-Pacific Spanish base. It later became American, and still is.  Her last name, after all, is Churchill.  Doesn&rsquo;t sound very Micronesian.<br>

		<p>Here is the Wikipedia pronouncement on the racial makeup of Guam:<br>
 <br>
The largest ethnic group are the native Chamorros, accounting for 37.1% of the total population. Other significant ethnic groups include those of Filipino (25.5%), White (10%) indicates of both European often of Spanish and white American ancestry, and the rest are of Chinese, Japanese and Korean ancestry.</p>
<p>The genetic contribution made by servicemen is not mentioned in the article. Mestizos are fairly common in Guam itself, so the percentage given for the native Chamorros would be an overstatement of their genetic contribution.</p>
