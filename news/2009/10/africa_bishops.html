<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9B6AQ5O0&amp;show_article=1">Africa Bishops Speak of Obama in Religious Terms</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniella Petroff, Breitbart, October 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African bishops attending a Vatican meeting are speaking about the election of Barack Obama in divine terms  &mdash;  putting them very much at odds with many of their U.S. counterparts.</p>
<p>Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra, Ghana said Wednesday that there was &#8220;a divine plan behind&#8221; Obama&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like the biblical story repeating itself,&#8221; he told reporters, citing the Old Testament figure Joseph, who after being sold into slavery in Egypt ends up becoming a top official.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe God has his own plans. God directs history,&#8221; he said of the U.S. election. &#8220;We pray that it (Obama&rsquo;s presidency) brings blessings for Africa and the whole world.&#8221;</p>
<p>He acknowledged that Obama has earned the wrath of many conservative American bishops because of his support for abortion rights. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Ghanian prelate leading the three-week meeting on the Church in Africa, Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson of Cape Coast, Ghana, cited Obama&rsquo;s election in saying he didn&rsquo;t see any reason why there couldn&rsquo;t now be a black pope.</p>
<p>And the archbishop of Kinshasa, Congo, Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, told the formal synod itself that it would be wise to not ignore what he called a &#8220;primordial event&#8221; in recent times.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra, Ghana said Wednesday that there was &lsquo;a divine plan behind&rsquo; Obama&rsquo;s election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, I could not agree more with Comrade Archbishop Gabriel here!</p>
<p>However, there is one great caveat to his asinine and windy pronouncement above, that I would like to add. This being, that I deeply believe that God&rsquo;s divine plan has nothing to do with bringing &ldquo;blessings for Africa&rdquo; or the world&rsquo;s Africans on any continent, but instead demonstrating what a plague of destructiveness and scourge of godless Marxism they really truly embody in this planet&rsquo;s currently deranged multicultural Circus Maximus when they obtain &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; in it. Moreover, given Comrade BO&rsquo;s nebulous religious upbringing, the diabolical cult of Islam is also hopefully in line for some well deserved changes in its current multicultural fetish status particularly in the West and the world in general. </p>
<p>What more to say, other than, God Let It Be So!!!</p>

		<p>It is clear that what the worthy bishop is looking forward to is the extension of the gravy train to Africa. Blacks believe that having one of their own in the White House will be enough to redistribute the wealth.</p>
<p>There is a misrepresentation on what some US bishops oppose. It is not that Obama has spoken abstractly of a woman&rsquo;s right to abort. What they have objected to is his &#8220;mince no words&#8221; defense of live birth (post-natal) abortions. This goes beyond what most Democratic politicians have been willing to defend.</p>

<p>Oh well, a minor detail, tut, tut.</p>
<p>Such pesky things, these &#8220;minor details.&#8221; They do tend to get in the way of a good celebration, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>Another genius from Ghana.  A bloody prophet.  Advertising his ignorance.  Obama is not descended from slaves.  Momma white.. Pappy from Kenya.  No comparison to Joseph who was sold into slavery by his brothers to eventually become one to deliver his brothers from famine. These people are chasing ghosts.  These blacks like the bishop Charles- Palmer Buckle + any thing else to sound more important will fall down and worship Obama for no other reason than he is partially black. How pathetic that the Church has allowed such a shallow man to become a bishop.  </p>

		<p>I am a Catholic and I seriously resent bishops from foreign countries making stupid political remarks about an American matter. May the African bishops do their appointed jobs in matters of faith and stay out of issues that they obviously do not understand. I support my American bishops in their critical opinion of Mr. Obama regarding right-to-life issues. It pains me to say so; but, do blacks (where ever they are) always stick together no matter how wrong they may be? </p>

		<p>Well said, O John of the night!</p>
<p>I myself have noticed, or perhaps caught glimpses of, some decidedly dictatorial African (or Marxist) traits in the Annointed. Not the least of which is a monstrous ego combined with a gigantic naivete (though he tries to hide it) about ANYTHING. </p>

		<p>This &#8220;archbishop&#8221; can say what he wants.  To me, Obama is still a typical Chicago politician: not very intelligent and not very honest.</p>

		<p>Sorry to disappoint the good &#8220;Archbishop&#8221;&hellip;  but what really swept Obama into the presidency was those magic spells cast in Kenya by his kinfolk. If a few live humans had to be sacrificed to ensure the efficacy of those fetishes and charms, one simply needs to think in terms of the greatest good for the greatest number. </p>

		<p>To Night Lizard,</p>
<p>Thanks for the supportive feedback sincerely!</p>
<p>I honestly believe, that we are watching our multicultural &ldquo;savior&rdquo; destroy himself before our very eyes; hopefully, the debased and vile Red diversity pantheon that has become our political &ldquo;system,&rdquo; will fall with him. Then we can rebuild it and see to it that we never have another mulatto demigod, ever again, become such an embarrassingly evident icon to our presently insane and misguided hubris. </p>
<p>All the best Night Lizard,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>  I am a Protestant. However, it is my understanding that the Catholic church teaches that it is the Holy Spirit that directs the Cardinals in selecting a Pope.  Are these African clerics saying that the &#8220;Holy Spirit&#8221; approves of Affirmative Discrimination aka A.A.?  I bet the Holy Spirit would be very interested in purging their unclean minds and hearts of their racial aggrandizement.  God looks at abilities and the heart.  These boobs couldn&rsquo;t probably distinguish between Karl Marx and the Spirit!  :(</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that this bishop from Ghana consider&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s abortion stance, to be a minor thing. After all, Africans south of Algeria have been practicing adult abortions against each other, in the following countries:</p>
<p>Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Congo, Demoratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, the new South Africa, Nigeria, Liberia, Madagascar, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea, Niger, Sierra Leone, Benin, Namibia, Guinea, and Malawi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessings for Africa&#8221;, means more American money, of course. But, if this guy thinks the Catholic church is going to elect a Bantu pope, then he&rsquo;s living in Fantasyland. The collection plates will be bereft of the green gravy. </p>

		<p>We can only HOPE AND PRAY our socialist leader will destroy himself before taking our nation down with him into defeat. The alternative, to see one state after another become another California, surviving bankruptcy by the slimmest margins&hellip; is simply too disgusting to endure.</p>
<p>You cannot ensure the survival, economic and social health of a first-world nation by allowing an influx of third-worlders equal to our White population. </p>

		<p>In the Virgin Islands Obama is a GOD.  Blacks walk the streets wearing t-shirts with his image and the streets are filled with signs with Obama&rsquo;s face on them.  This man could do anything, ask anything of these people and they would do it.  Unlike white people, the majority of blacks of every ethnicity will blindly follow a black leader no matter what. Take a trip to the Virgin Islands and you will get a preview of what is coming to the mainland USA.  It will be war.</p>
