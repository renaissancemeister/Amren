<h1>Which Chicago Ward Gets the Most Parking Tickets?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fran Spielman, Chicago Sun Times, October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 193,000 parking tickets were issued during the first eight months of this year in Chicago&rsquo;s showcase 42nd Ward, which includes downtown and the Gold Coast. That&rsquo;s 35 percent more tickets than the next-highest ward.</p>
<p>But when it comes to applying the Denver boot, the 42nd Ward is near the bottom of the list. Motorists parking in the congested ward were booted 577 times. Forty-two other wards have higher numbers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one of the tidbits from the booting and ticketing breakdown released Wednesday during Day One of City Council hearings on Mayor Daley&rsquo;s 2010 budget.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Revenue officials insist that the 42nd Ward has 192,758 tickets and only 577 boots because downtown cars are primarily parked in private garages and lots. Boot crews only prowl city streets.</p>
<p>Tougher to explain is the fact that 11 of the top wards on the boot list are majority black wards. The city has long insisted that boot crews are color-blind and &#8220;cover all areas equitably.&#8221;</p>

		<p>David Brooks of the NYT likes to tell a story when he gives speeches about UN diplomats and the number of NY City parking tickets they get.  They are, as diplomats, granted immunity, but guess who had no violations at all?</p>
<p>Here is an article laying it out: <a href="https://select.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/opinion/13brooks.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow">https://select.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/opinion/13brooks.html?_r=1</a></p>

		<p>&#8220;Tougher to explain&#8221; the obvious reality?</p>
<p>This is one of the laughable examples of political correctness that are all too commonplace nowadays. </p>
<p>Local schools, parks and libraries have brief histories listed online in Chicago that routinely distort the truth to avoid address the harsh realities that the egalitarians must deny constantly. For example, &#8220;The Jones Public Library formerly had an active historical society, but it suddenly ceased operations in 19  &mdash;   for no apparent reason.&#8221; The obvious reason had to be omitted from the web site   &mdash;   a community had suddenly changed from majority white to minority dominated and organizations and programs that matter to former residents held no interest for the newcomers.     </p>

		<p>Judging by the number of vacant lots in some of the black neighborhoods of Chicago, the residents there should have no trouble finding a place to park, unless parking in a vacant lot is against the law.</p>

		<p>As usual with these studies, there is a huge missing piece. The distribution of boots among the various wards is a useless statistic, unless one also has the distribution among the wards of those who have two or more unpaid tickets more than a year old. </p>
<p>If the number of parking ticket scofflaws (sp?) are not distributed evenly across the city, then of course the number of boots wouldn&rsquo;t be distributed evenly either. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often heard the term &#8220;DWB,&#8221; which is driving while black, and implies that you get pulled over more when you&rsquo;re black.  However, I wish someone would pull the race data on the red light cameras to see if perhaps those machines pick on black drivers as well.  A great way to test the DWB hypothesis or perhaps the possibility that black drivers really are more aggressive.</p>

		<p>Just another example of blacks not following rules.  <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/12_2_the_racial_profiling.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.city-journal.org/html/12_2_the_racial_profiling.html</a>  Here is another example that proves the disrespect for rules minorities have.  Who&rsquo;s neighborhood is full of trash on the sidewalk, dealers on the corner and prostitutes walking the streets?  </p>
<p>To me, the issue is the flagrant disregard for the law, rules and social norms in all circumstances when they know and understand the consequences.  Their IQ&rsquo;s may be generally lower, but they aren&rsquo;t that stupid.  90 in a 55 is not poor impulse control.  Maybe someone can help me elucidate my point more clearly?</p>

		<p>Cars are booted only if you do not pay parking tickets. The Gold coast people have money and probly pay the ticket off as soon as it arrives. It is a minor expense for them.</p>
<p>As for UN diplomates getting tickets, the solution is simple. Give them 30 days or take away their diplomatic immunity. This is within our power. They are not paying as a way of showing contempt for us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;unless parking in a vacant lot is against the law&hellip;&#8221; Yes sir. It is. My law. I`d write you a book about it, but I`m walking out the door to check on the latest transgressions in my vacant lot. Ski boats for sale, flea markets, dumping, oil changes and &#8220;Sonic Drags&#8221;* etc. The only time I came out a winner was when I pulled up at 3:00am to find an empty dump truck fleet parked there. So I did the natural thing and started throwing all my trash away. About the third tree stump that hit the bottom of the bed a cowboy trucker runs out of an apartment across the street in skivvies with boots in hand. &#8220;Who the hell gave you permission to fill my truck with trash?!?&#8221;,he yelled. &#8220;The same guy that said you could park in my vacant lot&#8221;, I replied. He then threatened to dump it all right back in my parking lot. So I stood at his driver side window with a fire ax and warned him that as soon as his tilt bed hit 12% the ax was gonna break glass and  his head in that order&hellip;  *Sonic Drag-Two hot rods park in a vacant lot, put their cars in neutral and then rev the engines to 7000RPM to see which car makes the most noise and smoke.</p>

<p>17. At least that&rsquo;s what the site &#8216;ihatethemedia&rsquo; reports. They were paid sometime during his presidential campaign. I Guess a senator race isn&rsquo;t even that important anymore.<br>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t we have some affirmative action here?  If blacks are 40 % of Chicagoans, shouldn&rsquo;t tickets for blacks be limted to 40 %?  Whites must be forced to pay tickets at the same percentage of their makeup of the population of Chicago.  Let&rsquo;s set up timetables and goals to secure this egalitarian dream.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe for a second that the black areas in Chicago are the main ones who get the boot no more than you can believe that most blacks pay their parking tickets. The reason why the gold coast gets more tickets is because the whites who own cars there actually pay off their tickets.  Anyone from Chicago knows this.</p>

		<p>One should also point out that the most densely populated areas of Chicago are the high-rises along the Lake Front.  The Zip-code where I live, 60657, is mostly White and is the most densely populated Zip-code in the country.  With more people, there are more tickets given.</p>
<p>Since the boot is given only to those who have a long history of not paying their tickets, that says more about those who get booted than it does about those who put the boot on cars.</p>
