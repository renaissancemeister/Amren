			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Beckford, London Telegraph, October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Primary school pupils and toddlers in nurseries are being punished for making racist insults, according to a report, even if they don&rsquo;t understand the terms they use.</p>
<p>Teachers are being treated like counter staff in police stations as they have to fill in forms detailing name-calling and jokes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile diversity &#8220;missionaries&#8221; are said to be increasing the divide between white and black children by forcing them to see everything through the prism of race.</p>
<p>Adrian Hart, the author of the report published by the Manifesto Club, a civil liberties group, said: &#8220;The obligation on schools to report these incidents wastes teachers&rsquo; time, interferes in children&rsquo;s space in the playground, and undermines teachers&rsquo; ability to deal with problems in their classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse, such anti-racist policies can create divisions where none had existed, by turning everyday playground spats into &#8216;race issues&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a small number of cases of sustained targeted bullying, and schools certainly need to deal with those. But most of these &#8216;racist incidents&rsquo; are just kids falling out. They don&rsquo;t need re-educating out of their prejudice  &mdash;  they and their teachers need to be left alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Ward, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: &#8220;Certainly any racist incident in schools should be dealt with swiftly but the definition of racism can be taken too far, especially with young children who clearly don&rsquo;t understand the connotation behind the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools are dealing with ever increasing bureaucracy as they are required to fill in more forms and provide more detail on any number of issues. This government micromanagement must be curtailed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the introduction of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which put a duty on public bodies to eliminate discrimination, schools were told they had to monitor the impact of their policies on the educational attainment of pupils of different races.</p>
<p>They were placed under a duty by the Government in 2002 to monitor and report all racist incidents to their local authority.</p>
<p>Special forms were created that require teachers to name the alleged perpetrator and victim, and spell out what they did and how they were punished. Schools can keep details on file.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report, called The Myth of Racist Kids, calculates that some 280,000 such incidents have been reported in England since full records began. An earlier investigation using Freedom of Information requests by Channel 4 News found 95,022 incidents between 2002-03 and 2005-06.</p>
<p>Birmingham City Council alone has seen numbers rise from 943 in 2002-03 to 1,606 in 2008-09, while 1,248 were logged by Leeds City Council schools last year following a &#8220;big push to make sure that all incidents are reported and recorded&#8221;. Essex County Council figures show that most of the children involved in reported racist incidents were aged between 9 and 11.</p>
<p>Schools that send in &#8220;nil&#8221; returns are criticised for &#8220;under-reporting&#8221;, and are sent letters telling them to put up posters raising awareness.</p>
<p>Any school that fails to investigate alleged racist incidents risks being seen as &#8220;condoning racism&#8221;, according to the official TeacherNet website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile those that report high numbers of racist incidents are praised for operating a &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; approach including, according to Essex, &#8220;an ethos which actively seeks to identify and eradicate all manifestations of racism, however trivial they may seem&#8221;.</p>
<p>Teachers and other school staff are allowed to report racism even if the alleged &#8220;victim&#8221; was not offended.</p>
<p>In many cases, the &#8220;perpetrator&#8221; is punished by the head teacher and their parents will be told.</p>
<p>The new report shows an example of a Racist Incident Referral Form in which a girl who called a boy &#8220;white trash&#8221; during a football game was &#8220;severely spoken to&#8221; and suffered &#8220;loss of lunchtime play&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sometimes the police are also called in, with the Crown Prosecution Service prosecuting 2,916 children aged between 10 and 17 for race or religious hate crimes in 2007-08, up from 404 just two years earlier.</p>
<p>In addition, 4,410 pupils were suspended or expelled for racist abuse in 2006-07, 350 of them in primary schools.</p>
<p>Even toddlers at nursery school are treated as potential racists, the report claims, with staff told &#8220;the earlier you can pick up any tendency towards discriminatory or prejudicial behaviour, the better chance you have of successfully tackling it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Hart, who was hired to make a film about racism in primary schools, says the strict policies undermine teachers&rsquo; ability to set behaviour standards for pupils and reduce them &#8220;to the level of police-station counter staff&#8221;.</p>
<p>He claims in many cases the children involved are friends who have fallen out.</p>
<p>He says they are often too young to understand the insults they are using, but are being treated unfairly for having &#8220;inadvertently committed an offence that adults call &#8216;racism&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Hart says he heard pupils saying that skin colour did not matter to them, but staff believed race must not be ignored and that children would &#8220;lose part of their selves&#8221; if their differences were not celebrated.</p>
<p>Mr Hart believes race equality &#8220;missionaries&#8221; who scrutinise relationships in schools are actually increasing division between pupils.</p>
<p>He says &#8220;anti-racism workshops&#8221; lead to more reported incidents, which means more intervention by officials.</p>
<p>One head teacher told him that an assembly on respect for difference had led to an &#8220;awful atmosphere&#8221; as &#8220;children who used to play beautifully together .. separate along racial lines&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report quotes a youth worker who says that when children of different backgrounds fight &#8220;it&rsquo;s not always a race issue&#8221;, but when it becomes recorded as such it &#8220;causes racism&#8221; because the children feel they have been treated unfairly.</p>
<p>Mr Hart recommends that the compulsory reporting of alleged racism is scrapped, and that schools are allowed to develop their own policies of discussing diversity and dealing with playground disputes.</p>
<p>Diana Johnson, the Schools Minister, said: &#8220;Bullying in all forms, including those motivated by prejudice, is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated. No-one should suffer the pain and indignity which bullying or racist abuse can cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools can make a positive contribution and help improve all children&rsquo;s lives, by creating a safe learning environment where all children feel valued and can enjoy and achieve. That is why we have given head teachers and school staff the legal powers and the support they need to tackle bullying, ensuring their authority cannot be questioned. If racist bullying is not dealt with in schools, then this will send a powerful message to children that racism is acceptable  &mdash;  not only in schools but in society as a whole.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Saw an interesting (tongue in cheek) comment on another site concerning  bi-racial children. &#8220;If you don`t know what color you are to begin with, how do you know which kids you`re not allowed to play with&#8221;?!?</p>

		<p>How many of these 40,000 were aggrieved white Britons? Less then the white percentage of the population, less than around 80% or so? Keep in mind each and every time a minority interacts with a white person, so too a white person is interacting with a minority. I&rsquo;m guessing less than 30,000 of the complaints are made by whites. This is the real issue. Is there a &#8216;chilling effect&rsquo; keeping whites from making complaints? Do they fear even more reprisals? Do whites not even notice? Why is it, wherever concerned citizens are doing the most they can in the fight against racism, this is exactly where the most racism can be found? At least going by the statistics.  </p>
<p>Now, maybe whites are uniquely racist. . Jared Taylor wrote a very good article about this. . you can read it if you click on the Canadian Flag on the front page. . or maybe the race industry itself is biased against whites. Who will speak out about this obvious imbalance in the stats? Anyone? Is racism important or isn&rsquo;t it? Or is it only important to Spread racism? That is, ferment it? Will someone notice this, or will we just be forced to learn once again about how (despite the body count) whites, and only whites, need to correct their behavior. The unique evil theory. </p>

<p>Celebrated? Whenever I hear that term, I picture people donning party hats, throwing out paper streamers and dancing a little jig.</p>
<p>Of course I know what the real implications of that term are. It really means depicting blacks and other non-whites, usually through the rehashing of history, as the nobler, put-upon races, and whites as the oppressors. That&rsquo;s the only kind of accentuating of racial differences that&rsquo;s allowed.</p>

		<p>What insanity! The Race Relations Act of 2000? White governments and their handlers throughout the world are so afraid of being labeled racists themselves that they are turning our countries into a no mans land!  It is their fault that there is racism from ALL sides because of their immigration policies flooding our lands with nonwhites. Multicultural societies never can unite, thrive or prosper. They were never meant to. Our &#8220;leaders&#8221; know this so maybe we should start asking why they have done it in the first place?</p>
<p> We all should know by now what their agenda has been. It is out in the open more everyday. Genocide of the White race and their lands. Do we allow that to happen?</p>

		<p>Anonymous #2, you can&rsquo;t &#8220;ferment&#8221; racism - though it would be nice if we could.  Then, according to the liberals at least, we&rsquo;d have a jolly old time at the upcoming conference!  I think you meant &#8220;foment&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the article is right on the mark.  Those ridiculous laws are training a whole generation to be professional victims - just as we have in the U.S.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering.  If an indigenous British child told the child of an African immigrant, &#8220;my ancestors have been here for many thousands of years, but yours have only been here a short time&#8221;, would such a statement of fact be considered &#8220;racism&#8221;?  It seems to me that hard anything can be said about race or ethnicity without it being considered &#8220;racist&#8221; by somebody.</p>

		<p>Anything that &#8220;&hellip;increases the divide between white and black children by forcing them to see everything through the prism of race&#8221; is fine with me.  And if a White boy gets beat up by a Jamaican kid who thinks he&rsquo;s just getting even for the slave trade, that&rsquo;s much better than race-mixing.  Next time the White boy will bring a sturdy stick. </p>

		<p>Our wonderful &#8216;labour&rsquo; (communist) government have done everything they could to encourage continual immigration for the past 12 years. They expect that this mass, uncontrolled and unwelcome wave of pakistani people with their inherent muslim hatred of Christians and Jews will eventually swamp England and refuse all attempts address the evil this policy had wrought. A website, &#8216;islam4uk&rsquo; carries the following announcement, and anyone who objects to it will be deemed &#8216;racist&rsquo; as are our our little children in school who, in their innocence, simply tell things as they see them. The wording certainly does not convey any sense of gratitude to our government for admitting them in the first place, but perhaps it&rsquo;s now a little late for labour to do anything about it and the newly elected government in May 2010 will have to pick up the pieces and sort out the mess.</p>
<p>    Islamic &ldquo;March For Shari&rsquo;ah&rdquo; on 31 October 2009</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, Islam and the Shari&rsquo;ah have reached new heights in the United Kingdom, Muslim communities up and down the country have brought forth a culture and system that is not only superior to the British way of life but also a shining example of what true subservience to Almighty God can bring to a society  drowning in disbelief and oppression. Recent months have been particularly debilitating for the British population who have struggled to get by as basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter have become more cumbersome to obtain. The MPs&rsquo; expenses scandal that shocked the nation unfortunately also demonstrates the cruel indifference the British government has towards its citizens and moreover how they appear to be more concerned with wasting public money on personal frivolities than investing it for the betterment of society. As a result of this perpetual malaise, Islam4UK with the help of sincere Muslims launched a series of Islamic Roadshow&rsquo;s that provided a real answer to the problems faced by the British community; with over 16 different locations already hit including, Birmingham, Slough, Lewisham, Peckham and Green Street, approximately 70 men and women have embraced Islam, reinforcing the dire need for Shari&rsquo;ah in contemporary Britain. In light of all this, Islam4UK would like to declare the launch of a spectacular procession that will take place on 31st October 2009. We hereby request all Muslims in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow and all other places to join us and collectively declare that as submitters to Almighty Allah (SWT), we have had enough of democracy and man-made law and the depravity of the British culture. On this day we will call for a complete upheaval of the British ruling system its members and legislature, and demand the full implementation of Shari&rsquo;ah in Britain.<br>
First Stop:  House of Commons<br>
The primary source of polytheistic legislation in Britain, the House of Commons is at the centre of Britain&rsquo;s oppressive law making policies; from here fallible men and women decide what should be legal and illegal. It is from this very place where the lives of millions of people in the UK are changed and it is from here where unjust wars are launched. Islam4UK stewards and guides will be at hand to direct all attendees to the centre of the congregation from where the March for Shari&rsquo;ah will officially commence.<br>
Second Stop: 10 Downing Street<br>
Almost 300 years old, 10 Downing Street is the official residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gordon Brown, the current Prime Minister, is one of the chief figures in making laws and regulating the affairs of society. In the last few years, he has undoubtedly brought Britain down to an all new low and appears to be truly blind to the damaging impact of his oppressive bureaucracy. After demanding the abolishment of the House of Commons Muslims will then march to 10 Downing Street, and call for the removal of the tyrant Gordon Brown from power.<br>
Third Stop: Trafalgar Square<br>
A site of significant historical value, Muslims will gather even more support from tourists and members of the public, making clear in the heart of London the need for Shari&rsquo;ah in society. It will be here where the march will culminate and finish and we hope that with the help of Allah (SWT) it will be very successful.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Many, many years ago the journalist Michael Wharton coined the term &#8216;race relations industry&rsquo; to describe the nascent bureaucracy that was emerging to enforce racial preferences.<br>
 How prophetic Wharton was!, his elegant turn of phrase was not only descriptive but even he couldn&rsquo;t envision the massive growth of the race relations industry.</p>

		<p> A 14 year old white girl was cautioned by the police in 2006 in the north of England for refusing to do group work with a group of Pakistanis. The reason, they were all speaking in Urdo.

<p>Probably so. It&rsquo;s been said in here before: words spoken by whites are taken more seriously than physically violence done by persons of color. Violence which is often not even reported on or discussed at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s often &#8216;swept under the rug&rsquo; or hushed up. For the actual victim it&rsquo;s another insult. We&rsquo;ve reached the point really where all whites feel this? Sense what is going on. Both the fear of physical violence and the fear of repressive authority. Samual Francis called this &#8216;anarcho-fascism&rsquo;, I think. The move depraved non-whites become, the more the authorities are forced to crack down, on whites. </p>

<p>&#8220;Schools Report 40,000 Cases of Racism a Year&#8221;</p>
<p>Pardon..  &#8220;cases&#8221; of&hellip; &#8220;racism?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was recently brought to my attention (on another blog) that the definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; has now shifted to ethnicity, rather than race.  Clearly, its definition is at the whim of the same people who made Obama synonymous with &#8220;change,&#8221; change synonymous with &#8220;change for the better,&#8221; and anyone who was - in any way - against anything Obama as&hellip; against change itself.</p>
<p>Never you mind that if I had a previously useful limb, which then become gangrenous, would represent &#8220;change&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the dictionaries I own does not contain the word &#8220;racism,&#8221; which makes it worth its weight in gold to me&hellip;  The other offers the following:</p>
<p>1) The belief that certain races, especially one&rsquo;s own, are superior to others.<br>
2) Discriminatory behavior or practices based on this view.</p>
<p>This is obviously a liberal word to begin with, but in its infancy was not so bold as to its use as an &#8220;ad hominem&#8221; argument.</p>
<p>Do not we homo sapiens believe ourselves superior to cockroaches, and do we not thus adjust our behavior - in a &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; fashion, no less (though &#8220;discriminating tastes&#8221; were once a sign of wisdom, rather than ignorance) - towards them?  Of course we do.  Is this wrong?  Is it any more or less wrong when we consider ourselves &#8220;superior&#8221; to bacteria, and through antibiotics seek the death of billions?</p>
<p>Now, this definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; has expanded to include ethnicity - rather than &#8220;race,&#8221; which is a biological term (by which we are all homo sapiens).</p>
<p>Witnesseth the comments section of this blog: (http://stuffblackpeopledontlike.blogspot.com/2009/09/5-classical-music.html)</p>
<p>That there is a word that exists - now SOLELY - to castigate others for exposing truth.</p>
<p>When will - and how do - we reclaim language?</p>
