<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Union Bethel [African Methodist Episcopal], which also has a location in Brandywine, hands its Temple Hills building over to Romero, who leads prayers and songs entirely in Spanish during a Sunday service. Romero said that there are Hispanic churches in the area, but Union Bethel is one of the only African-American churches in south county he knows of that is trying to integrate Hispanics  &mdash;  most of whom are immigrants  &mdash;  into its congregation.</p>
<p>The Rev. Anthony Young, a minister with Union Bethel, said the idea for Spanish language services sprang from changes he began noticing last year around the shopping center.</p>
<p>About a year ago, he said, a Jumbo Food International  &mdash;  which stocks products from around the world  &mdash;  opened several doors down from the church. When a sign appeared in another storefront advertising a peluqueria, Spanish for &#8220;barbershop,&#8221; Young said he and Union Bethel&rsquo;s Rev. Harry L. Seawright decided to reach out to their new neighbors.</p>
<p>In addition to the Spanish language services, Hispanic congregants are invited to church events and can use church resources, from counseling to home buying workshops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Hispanic immigrant population in Prince George&rsquo;s County has grown steadily over the last five years. As of 2008, immigrants of all nationalities made up around 18.5 percent of the total population in the county, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2003, immigrants were less than 14 percent of the county.</p>
<p>Romero, who is also a chaplain with the county corrections department, said most of the Hispanic worshippers coming to Union Bethel are immigrants from a variety of Latin American countries, including El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The search for jobs and affordable housing is leading immigrants into the suburbs, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial conflict can also be an issue when Hispanics move into a mostly African-American community like Temple Hills, Young said, but neither he nor Romero said they sensed tension.</p>

<p>Maybe for now, but once the Latinos start to really increase their numbers in the neighborhood and start to squeeze out indigenous Blacks, that is when the real tension is going to start. When a minority is small enough, it is not a problem. Only when they get big enough to be problematic, is when conflict becomes inevitable.</p>

		<p>These churches will do anything to gain membership and spit in the face of law and order.  I have come to despise churches who are not only selling out White Americans but encouraging civil disobedience by harboring known criminals. Join an organization that looks out for your rights, churches only look out for their budgets.</p>

<p>I once did some construction work at a black church in Oakland that also had a latino outreach program. At this church, the latinos had a separate service that was conducted in Spanish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe for now, but once the Latinos start to really increase their numbers in the neighborhood and start to squeeze out indigenous Blacks, that is when the real tension is going to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. When blacks outnumbered hispanics throughout much of inner city LA, there wasnt the race war you see now. In fact, there were blacks in hispanic gangs and vice versa.</p>

		<p>Black church services are somewhat like black gang fights minus the robes and deaths.  Everybody has to speak, everybody has something to add.  I believe thats why it&rsquo;s called trash talk.</p>
<p>Most Hispanics are raised Catholic, how does this fit? The Father speaks, others respond by rote. </p>
<p>The work ethic alone will keep these two ethnicities apart. Guess which one has the work ethic?</p>

<p>True, but it&rsquo;s not entirely surprising they are trying to woo them. Many blacks do feel that by uniting with Hispanics, they will share a power structure against whites, since Hispanics already out number blacks, and will soon far out number them. Also, many blacks are physically attracted to Hispanics, and are very much interested in the prospects of mixing with them, and marrying them, and are often quite open about it. Though, the reverse is often not true. Far fewer Hispanics are romantically, or sexually interested in AA&rsquo;s, though to hear blacks tell it, they often make it sound as though there is no infighting going on between them, and all are merrily &#8220;mixing it up&#8221;, as the like to put it.</p>

		<p>To pray in sing songs in Spanish, that is one thing. But I see something that might even further complicate this attempt at unifying with Hispanics, through religion: the Hispanics, I believe, are Catholic, for most; while most Blacks in the U.S. are Protestants, as far as I know.</p>
