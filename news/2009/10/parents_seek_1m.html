			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Bates, Daily Mail (London), October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white pupil was battered with a hammer at a school where politically correct teachers were afraid to deal with racial tensions, the High Court heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Henry Webster, 15, suffered a fractured skull and brain damage after being set upon by a gang of Asian youths.</p>
<p>Twelve people were jailed over the 2007 attack, but Mr Webster&rsquo;s parents have now brought a civil action against Ridgeway Foundation School near Swindon.</p>
<p>They claim there was a negligent failure to maintain proper discipline and deal with racial tension and are seeking compensation of up to £1million.</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s lawyers told the court a &#8216;culture of racist bullying and harassment&rsquo; built up around a 30-strong gang called the &#8216;Asian Invasion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Teachers were too anxious about being seen as bigoted to intervene, but white pupils were branded &#8216;racist&rsquo; by the acting headmaster and given harsher punishments.</p>
<p>Robert Glancey, QC, representing the family, said tensions escalated after the July 7 London bombings in 2005 and when more Asian pupils joined the school, some of whom were &#8216;radicalised and hostile&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Racial intimidation and violence became a &#8216;feature of the life of the school&rsquo; with eruptions of &#8216;extreme acts of violence&rsquo;, it was alleged.</p>
<p>Asians were &#8216;encouraged&rsquo; to separate from white pupils and formed a gang that would laugh at and abuse them.</p>
<p>Serious incidents included a riot on the playing field in May 2006, which led to armed police attending the school.</p>
<p>At the same time, white pupils received unfair treatment, the court was told. One boy was disciplined for wearing an England shirt.</p>
<p>Mr Glancey said: &#8216;There were a large number of incidents, events, complaints and warnings which would or should have made any school which was being reasonably competent realise there was a serious problem with racism, violence security, discipline and misbehaviour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Webster was attacked after being told an Asian youth wanted a one-to-one fight. But reinforcements from outside the school were called in by mobile phone.</p>
<p>Among the 12 jailed for between eight months and eight years for GBH and ABH over the incident were Wasif Khan, 18, and Amjad Qazi, 19.</p>
<p>They were the eldest members of the group which attacked Mr Webster and were not pupils at the school. Instead they journeyed to there after a series of text messages and phone calls from Asian pupils.</p>
<p>Ridgeway School disputes the allegations against it and says blaming it for the attack, carried out by a non-pupil outside school hours, is &rsquo; unprecedented and far-fetched&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The case is being brought by Mr Webster, now 18, his mother Elizabeth Walker, 46, who has her own nanny recruitment business, his younger brother Joseph, 14, and his step-father Roger Durnford, 44, who runs a building company.</p>
<p>They are also seeking damages, saying they were traumatised by witnessing his injuries and his suffering.</p>
<p>The case continues.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly enough Spartan24.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying to contemplate how many kids have already been sacrificed at the altar of diversity. </p>

<p>When a child in what was once Great Britain is disciplined for wearing an England shirt you can&rsquo;t be surprised that at the same school non-white children are permitted to assault white children.<br>
Today white British children are taught to be ashamed to be British and ashamed to be white.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame the anti-white media in the US, GB and several other nations has succeeded in turning whites into cowards, who freeze when violence strikes. 45 years on back, if this had happened to a white youngster in GB or the US, the local white residents would have banded together and stomped the culprits into the pavement - at the very least. Look at the Detroit riots in 1948. Blacks started it, roaming in packs but were quickly on the run from whites who simply picked up two by fours and linoleum knives etc and ran the blacks ragged. Look it up. </p>

&#8216;Racist&rsquo; school hammer attack report quashed.<br>
Thursday, October 22, 2009.</p>
<p>An official review into a &#8220;racist&#8221; hammer attack on a schoolboy was so flawed that it must be quashed, the High Court ruled today. Henry Webster, then 15, was repeatedly hit on the head with a claw hammer at Ridgeway School in Wroughton, near Swindon, Wiltshire, in January 2007 and left with life-threatening injuries.  But the school&rsquo;s insurers advised against Ridgeway co-operating with a serious case review set up by the Swindon Local Safeguarding Children Board until after a claim for damages by Henry and his family, alleging negligence by the school, had been heard. Today a judge ruled the board, instead of holding a speedy and comprehensive review, had unlawfully phased the inquiry in compliance with the insurer&rsquo;s wishes - delaying its final report by many months.  He ordered the board to hold a new review to comply with the terms of his judgment.  The judge said the purpose of statutory serious case reviews was to learn lessons to prevent future similar incidents.  The assault on Henry involved a group of Asian schoolboys and three car-loads of Asian men who came on to school premises after being summoned by the boys on mobile phones.  Mr Justice Kenneth Parker said: &#8220;The spectre of statutory serious case reviews being stifled by the insurance industry would be potentially of such significance to public policy as to engage the attention of the Secretary of State and, through him if need be, the Association of British Insurers and - in the last resort - the industry regulator, the Financial Services Authority.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why are students anywhere allowed to have these cell phones where they can send text messages in the first place??</p>
<p>Adults were involved in this case, just not kids. And the use of a hammer indicates the intent to use lethal force. This kid was in danger of being killed. And over what exactly?</p>
<p><br>
These &#8220;Asians&#8221; too are Muslims, from the names Qazi, Khan, etc.!</p>
<p>Hindu and Sikh &#8220;Asians&#8221; get along pretty well with the general British populace. NOT Muslims?<br>
