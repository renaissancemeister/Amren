<h1>Richmond Cops Arrest Three More Suspects Overnight in Gang-Rape Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roman Gokhman, Contra Costa Times (California), October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three suspects have been arrested in connection to the rape of a 15-year-old girl outside of her high school homecoming dance Saturday, bringing the total number of people in custody in the case to five.</p>
<p>A 21-year-old man, Salvador Rodriguez, was arrested near the corner of 26th Street and Humphrey Avenue at 7:40 p.m., Richmond police Lt. Mike Gormley said. Shortly after 10 p.m., police arrested a 16-year-old boy in San Pablo.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old boy was not at home when police searched his Pinole home, but once he got word that he was being sought, he turned himself in to police, Gormley said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detectives continued wall-to-wall interviews of students and former students, having already arrested a 15-year-old boy and 19-year-old Manuel Ortega.</p>

								<h2>Police: As Many As 20 Present at Gang Rape Outside School Dance</h2>
						<p>
							<i>CNN, October 28, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Investigators say as many as 20 people were involved in or stood and watched the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl outside a California high school homecoming dance Saturday night.</p>
<p>Police posted a $20,000 reward Tuesday for anyone who comes to them with information that helps arrest and convict those involved in what authorities describe as a 21‚ÅÑ2-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus in suburban San Francisco.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lighted back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911 to report it, police said.</p>
<p>A 1999 California law makes it illegal not to report a witnessed crime against a child, but the law applies only to children 14 and under.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not have the ability to arrest people who witnessed the crime and did nothing,&#8221; Gagan said. &#8220;The law can be very rigid. We don&rsquo;t have the authority to make an arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The victim was found unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday, after police received a call from someone in the area who had overheard people at the assault scene &#8220;reminiscing about the incident,&#8221; Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan said.</p>
<p>The girl was flown by helicopter to a hospital where she was admitted in critical condition. She was in stable condition Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one individual in custody who has made some spontaneous statements that have led me to believe that he is culpable for what happened,&#8221; Richmond police Lt. Johan Simon said.</p>
<p>Nineteen-year-old Manuel Ortega, described as a former student at the school, was arrested soon after he fled the scene and will face charges of rape, robbery and kidnapping, police said.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old was later arrested and charged with one count of felony sexual assault. A third teenager was being interviewed, Gagan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on witness statements and suspect statements, and also physical evidence, we know that she was raped by at least four suspects committing multiple sex acts,&#8221; Gagan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated,&#8221; Gagan said.</p>

		<p>It seems like the rampant family values of the hispanic community do not apply here. If they did then so many would not have been eager to participate in this assault. My experiences in Northern va. attest that these family values reside with only a few. If immigration (both government endorsed and illegal) is not quelled this will be more rampant. </p>

		<p>I watched a very disturbing movie this past weekend called &#8216;Sin Nombre&rsquo; (now out on DVD).  It potrays a group of Hondurans attempting to reach Texas on the roofs of trains.  On display in this film are all of the wonderful benefits of diversity of the Latin American variety; drugs, theft, rape, violence, lack of conscience, etc. All of these features of this culture travel northward and enter the United States in concert with their perpetrators.  The few decent individuals protrayed in the film were all vitimized by either their fellow contrymen or the Mexicans they encountered along the way.  I highly recommend this film.  It would be enriching too for all your leftist, multi-culti fanatical friends, aquaintenances, and co-workers.</p>

		<p>In comments yesterday &#8220;anonymous&#8221; suggested that the racial makeup of the school was more white than the 2nd article in the post on the Richmond gang rape was incorrect.  Here is the data<br/>
as presented by the school district itself:</p>

		<p>Folks overlook that rape is sometimes an act of war.<br/>
It is a blantant disrespect for both an individual and a culture, and sure it is always a cowardly act by males who<br/>
do not respect for themselves as human beings, <br/>
and by my judgement they are probably right on that count.<br/>

<p>Thanks for the school demographics LINK, very interesting.</p>
<p>Not only is the school only 2% white and 72% percent Hispanic invaders, take a look at the class size breakdown:</p>
<p>Grade 9 - 730 students <br/>
Grade 10 - 431 students <br/>
Grade 11 - 229 students <br/>
Grade 12 - 384 students </p>
<p>Wonder why the freshman class is twice the size of all other grades?  Muchos incoming anchor babies is my guess.</p>

		<p>The rampant corruption,violence and overwhelming poverty associated with latin third world is a reflection of the population that inhabit them. When they cross the border they import their values with them. Keep in mind also the new waves of illegals have no intentions of assimilating. What are we left with.</p>

		<p>Look at the video of the rape victim&rsquo;s white friend :</p>
<p>http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/29/california.rape.victim.friend/</p>
<p>She mentions how authorities don&rsquo;t protect whites, who are in the minority at Richmond High.  Reading between the lines, I think that suggests something about the gang rape victim&rsquo;s probable race.</p>
<p>More from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Baker &hellip; described the 15-year-old girl as a churchgoer who struggled to fit in at Richmond High &hellip; She had come alone to the Richmond High School homecoming dance, gorgeous in a sparkling purple dress and faux diamond baubles. The DJ played salsa, meringue, rap. When the teenager disappeared, her friends thought she had gone home early.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why would they even consider what they were doing was wrong it was just a FIESTA to them. They come into America ILEGALLY  (no problem) they drive without insurance or a license (no problem) they commit one violent crime after another (no problem) so again I ask &#8220;why would they consider this to be a problem&#8221; ?</p>

		<p>The victim was white. The perps were Hispanics in a school 75% Hispanic. Sounds like ethnic cleansing, Bosnia style.</p>
<p>What are the odds they will get charged with a hate crime? </p>

		<p>Oh, and also, from http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/28/BA621ABOF6.DTL :</p>
<p>About 200 students, teachers and community leaders rallied outside the campus after school Wednesday to condemn the rape and to say they wanted people to know the crime was not representative of their campus, despite the negative reputation of the crime-plagued city.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am devastated,&#8221; said senior Norma Bautista, her voice cracking with emotion. &#8220;I&rsquo;m here because I want everybody in Arizona, in New York, everywhere they are, (to know) that we are not criminals. We are the future leaders. I see people call us animals. Why don&rsquo;t you look at those of us who are trying to make a change?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most speakers blamed the rape at least in part on degrading, dehumanizing societal attitudes toward women.</p>
<p>Biology teacher Lorna McClellan said the problem of rape is not just confined to low-income cities with high crime rates, such as Richmond, and that she hoped community revulsion over the weekend attack will help spark societal change in the way some men view women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women are portrayed on TV and in music as pieces of meat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When are we going to take the challenge and step up and change this?&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
(1) Norma Bautista, deep emotional human-hearted one that she is, is given a platform to countercharge those that would call the rapists &#8220;animals&#8221; - but no one who would actually call them &#8220;animals&#8221; is given voice in the article.</p>
<p>(2) *Bautista* (Hispanic name) makes it seem like an us-vs-them thing.  She keeps mentioning &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;, presumably in regards to the hispanic students of the school.  I don&rsquo;t think that she would be saying that if the rape victim was of the same race as the rapists.</p>
<p>(3) Also, cute how Norma is more concerned with the public perception of her compadre &#8220;future leader&#8221; rapists than compassion for their life-shattered victim.</p>
<p>(4) Yup, sure &#8220;Biology teacher Lorna McClellan&#8221;.  Yup, gang rapes like this happen in high income areas all the time - practically every day.  Not a race/class thing at all.  And, yup, you&rsquo;re right, the problem here is not enough equalitarianism, not waaaaaaaaay too much of it already.  Yup.  Totally.</p>

<p>To add to your response:</p>
<p>(5)  What was with her swipe about Arizona?  I think she&rsquo;s trying to insult the strong anti-invasion movement there.  To put it another way, she&rsquo;s insinuating that there will be an &#8220;anti-immigrant backlash,&#8221; i.e. a political movement for real border control.<br/>

Thomas, I went to jr and sr high schools that were majority latino. The reason the freshman classes are larger is because the latinos haven&rsquo;t started dropping out. They drop at higher rates than blacks. </p>
