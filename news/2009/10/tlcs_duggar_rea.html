<h1>TLC&rsquo;s Duggar Reality Family Welcomes First Grandchild</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo!, October 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TV&rsquo;s biggest reality family just got a little bigger.</p>
<p>Joshua and Anna Duggar  &mdash;  from TLC&rsquo;s &#8220;18 Kids and Counting&#8221;  &mdash;  welcomed daughter Mackynzie Renee Duggar on Thursday, according to People.</p>
<p>Meredith Vieira also announced the news on Friday&rsquo;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show on NBC, noting the baby weighed in at 8 pounds and was 19.5 inches long.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although she is the first child for the young couple, both 21, she certainly has a lot of family who were anxious to meet her, with 17 aunts and uncles in the Duggar clan.</p>
<p>In fact, the brood is about to grow again in 2010, as Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar are expecting their 19th child in the spring.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mackynzie Duggar&rsquo;s birth will be featured on an &#8220;18 Kids and Counting&#8221; special, titled &#8220;First Grandduggar&#8221;, airing Tuesday, Oct. 13 at 9 PM on TLC.</p>
<p>As previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, TLC will change the name of the Duggars&rsquo; reality show to &#8220;19 Kids and Counting,&#8221; following Mackynzie&rsquo;s birth.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see an income-and-expense statement for this household.  Even if they buy all their clothing second-hand and cut out non-essential extracurricular activities like ballet and music lessons, this size of household is extremely expensive.  Even if they live on a diet of yams and grilled-cheese sandwiches, they are still dropping a grand each time they leave the grocery store.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t particularly care for the Duggar family&rsquo;s religous beliefs, it seems to work for them. At least they are self-supporting, get no public assistance of any kind, pay taxes and since the mother homeschools the children they don&rsquo;t even utilize part of the tax-funded programs to which they are entitled. </p>

		<p>I wish them all the best. I can&rsquo;t tell you how this family grates on the zero child liberal couple that cashed it all in on &#8220;pleasures&#8221; and now are old, lonely, and enraged at those who have lots of children. I decided to pay my kids to have kids, $25,000 each plus help with playing Grandpa. Having a clan would be fun, and my children will inherit the future. It&rsquo;s only money.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Duggar is clearly an oppressed woman who needs the state to liberate her from oppressive patriarchal marriage enslavement. She would be much happier without a man and with government handouts. <br>
On a serious note, it is wonderful to see a healthy large family amid God-forsaken pregnancy freak shows constantly on TV. Of course the Duggars are portrayed as freaks while pregnant whores and medical experiments like &#8220;octomom&#8221; and the pregnant &#8220;man&#8221; (a delusional woman who cut off her breasts and takes testosterone medication) on Oprah are hailed as miracles. These freaks would give Dr. Mengele the creeps. </p>

		<p>The Druggars get most of their money from welfare.  Not government welfare but the welfare of church and corporations for what it&rsquo;s worth.  Jim always says that he is a &#8220;developer&#8221; and &#8220;politician&#8221; but I would find it a lot more palatable if he told the truth.</p>

		<p>Whoa! Impressive numbers. Imagine if there were 50 thousand families like that in the quiverfull movement and they averaged 10 children per family. That&rsquo;s half a million kids right there. Then if those children were in turn to have at least eight kids a piece, then that&rsquo;s 4 million right there! That the size of a small country in only three generations. If the third generation continued this trend and had at least eight children a piece then those 4 million would hit 24 million and that&rsquo;s in less than 80 years time. <br>
 <br>
I think they&rsquo;ve found a very simple solution to the declining White birthrate. All Whites that care about the future should help these people achieve this. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to have a large family, all you need to do is donate a small amount to families like these and help them achieve this noble goal.<br>

		<p>Madison Grant sees the Duggar family as true heros and I emphatically agree.  I believe I have read that this remarkable woman has also home schooled this ultra-large family.  She is a shining example of the value of a stay-at-home mother and her husband appears to appreciate her fully.   Now if Caucasian couples of child bearing age can just come to admire this family and regard them as hero and heroine, perhaps our decaying white population can reverse course and postpone indefinitely encroachment of a non-white majority United States.<br>
Just think!<br>
	White families of 1/3 to ½ the size of the Duggars.<br>
	Feminist ideology be damned.<br>
	Families of children with a full time adult supervising and teaching.<br>
	Churches encouraging and spiritually teaching these large families.<br>
	Immigration reduced to replacement level and once again merit based.<br>
	Emphatically ban same sex marriage and discourage cohabitation.<br>
I would favor such a civil society even offering financial incentives for large families and one parent supervising at all times.  <br>

		<p>I saw part of an episode of &#8220;18 kids and counting&#8221; when they went to Aldi to shop for basics. It took 11 carts and cost approximately $3000 for a month&rsquo;s worth of food. I think the Duggar&rsquo;s own some cell phone towers or some other type of real estate that covers the bills. I&rsquo;m not too keen on the trendy names, but give them credit, they are not mooching off of the taxpayers. </p>

		<p>&hellip; And not a hint of Welfare to be seen.</p>
<p> All those lucky kids know who their Father is, there&rsquo;s even a Father in the home. Those well-behaved kids have deservedly proud parents who genuinely love their Children and don&rsquo;t sponge a single Nickel off the state, they encourage them to help their younger siblings. Those Children have a great future to look forward to because they have parents who inspire them to be all they can be.</p>
<p> Duggar family, I salute you.<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to be a party pooper, but these children mean nothing in a multicultural society where they could easily interbreed with Mestizos, blacks, Asians, half-Mestizos, quadroons, passable octoroons and what not. Separation NOW is the only way to save the White race. Birthrates can come later. </p>

		<p>First, I truly admire the self-sufficiency, the discipline, and total family devotion that the Duggars have. I can&rsquo;t help but feel, though, that a woman isn&rsquo;t designed to be pregnant 18 years of her life. Her reproductive system must be dangerously spent; it can&rsquo;t be healthy. That being said, they appear to be one of the most well-adjusted, respectful, organized and HAPPY families I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

		<p>I applaud those who see this for what it is- a good home, with wonderful morals and standards, parents who truly care about the well being and happiness of their children and most of all, have a faith in something other than themselves. A great man was once quoted as saying &#8220;Neither infedelity, nor money are the number 1 cause of divorce. Selfishness is.&#8221; I do not see any selfishness in these people at all, yet there are those who dare to judge their ability and desire to have a large family as selfish. On what grounds do they make that call? This couple has a solid foundation for which their family is founded, much like our country once was. Bravo to them for it! And if they continue to stay on the course they have chosen, they, unlike our country, they will have something even greater to support them in times of trial- peace. And for those who speculate or dare to judge on where they get their money, how they &#8220;do&#8221; it, from an economic perspective, my question to you is&hellip;why do you care? You didn&rsquo;t make the same choice to follow the same path so it is, frankly, none of your business. They don&rsquo;t come to you for stipends, they don&rsquo;t knock on your door asking for a hand out, they don&rsquo;t ask you for anything at all. They support themselves, they do for themselves, they teach and they lead&hellip;and if you haven&rsquo;t noticed, you&rsquo;re watching- so whether you like it or not, you&rsquo;re following on some level. Bottom line: The Duggard&rsquo;s dare to be different; they follow God, their convictions and their hearts, BRAVO! </p>

		<p>My paternal Grandfather was one of 18 children. My paternal Grandmother was one of 12 children. </p>
<p>While growing up in Ireland, she knew a family that had 21 children. Yet, no one thought anything about it. That was normal. </p>
<p>If young White couples would have half those children, we would not be in a demographic melt down, today. Outlaw Abortion, and watch our numbers turn around. </p>
<p>As far as what they named their child, I understand that one of their Grandparents&rsquo; last names was MacKenzie. I would rather hear the name MacKenzie or Madison, than Tawana or Twaniqua, any day.</p>

		<p>As much as I love to see large white families, this is too much.  What man in America could successfully support a brood that large on one income (unless you have the wealth of a Bill Gates)? Have any of you men tried it? Someone else mentioned that they get a form of welfare in a round-about way (churches, etc.); that makes sense.</p>
<p>How many of those kids are deprived of a parent&rsquo;s attention due to the fact that there are just way too many of them? They&rsquo;ve hit the tipping point. The older kids can&rsquo;t do everything, and they shouldn&rsquo;t have to take on parental responsibilities while they are still children themselves.  I don&rsquo;t care what they did in the &#8216;good ole days&rsquo;.</p>
<p> &#8220;and cut out non-essential extracurricular activities like ballet and music lessons,&#8221;<br>
I don&rsquo;t consider these non-essentials.  It&rsquo;s a quality of life issue, I suppose.  I consider familiarity with the Western arts an essential part of education. </p>
<p>From the postings so far, it is obvious that my opinion is in the minority; so be it.  Nineteen children are too many.  </p>

		<p>This is an amazing family.  I wish all the best for the new additions to their ever expanding family.</p>
<p>I watching their show the other day and I figured that if each of the 18 Duggar children have 18 kids, there would 324 grandchildren.  And I thought the Osmonds had a lot of kids.</p>

<p>Any evidence for this accusation?  Actually, the Duggars get most of their money from rental properties owned by the father.  Even if they did get money from their church, who cares?  A church, as a private charity, can give money to whoever they choose.  I would be more than happy to donate money to support families like the Duggars.</p>
