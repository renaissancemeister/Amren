<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A UCLA student allegedly stabbed a classmate five times and slashed her throat in a crime that prosecutors said Tuesday was premeditated and unprovoked.</p>
<p>Damon Thompson, 20, was charged with one count of attempted murder in Thursday&rsquo;s attack in a chemistry lab in Young Hall.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face life in state prison with the possibility of parole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense attorney Robin B. Berkovitz described her client as a hard-working biochemistry major with no criminal record.</p>
<p>She said his mother flew in from Belize and his father came from out of state to attend the arraignment at the Airport Courthouse in Westchester.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was assigned to the case today. There is a lot of information that has yet to be presented,&#8221; Berkovitz said Tuesday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a sad situation for all parties involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite initial reports that there had been an argument between the suspect and victim, prosecutors said the attack was unprovoked and that Thompson pulled out a knife and began stabbing the victim for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Authorities said the victim, identified in court as Katherine Rosen, 20, suffered five stab wounds and a slashed throat.</p>
<p>Rosen was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in critical condition but has been steadily improving, doctors said.</p>

		<p>I am willing to bet that Damon Thompson was at UCLA as an affirmative action student and that his education and living expenses were funded by the State of California and the Federal Government.  i.e., he was most likely not qualified to be there, he displaced a more qualified USA citizen, and (primarily) White taxpayers paid for his schooling and housing.  </p>
<p>This is how the USA government tries to replace its White citizens with Minorities.  </p>

		<p>And how did he get into UCLA?  California, for all its faults, does have a solid anti-affirmative action law, so I suppose his Belizian transcripts were fake.  Otherwise, he doesn&rsquo;t look like the kind of person one would call an academic superstar.</p>

<p>There are ways around Prop. 209; otherwise the number of blacks and latinos enrollees at UCLA would drop (for them)to an unconscionably low number.</p>
<p>I found this online:</p>

<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/UCLA-Adopts-Holistic-Model/37637" rel="nofollow">https://chronicle.com/article/UCLA-Adopts-Holistic-Model/37637</a></p>
<p>The University of California at Los Angeles announced on Thursday that it planned to adopt a more &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; admissions model in response to declining black enrollments. The new model, approved this week by UCLA&rsquo;s Academic Senate, will replace a system in which portions of each application were fielded off to different reviewers with a system under which each application is examined in its entirety.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I assume examining each application in it&rsquo;s &#8220;entirety&#8221; means scouring for things favorable to black and latino applicants.  And even prior to the policy chance, I suspect there were still tactics employed to admit underqualified blacks.  </p>
<p>Heather Mcdonald wrote an interesting article on the topic here:</p>

		<p>Question Diversity - The law you refer to is routinely ignored by Univeristy administrators. They are constantly coming up with schemes to get more blacks and Mexicans in. They have essays where you sprinkle how disadvantaged you are or where you live to give the necessary hints. They use grade point averages knowing somebody who could barely get a correspondence school GED could get a 4.0 at those high schools. The grade point scheme backfired when all the Asian kids started taking advanced placement classes and added one grade point to their averages.</p>
<p>This kid was probably let in because the adminstrators couldn&rsquo;t get enough American blacks and rationalized that this was a double win - black and we get to be enriched by his genuine African culture.</p>

		<p>Sad all around?  A girl is almost murdered in a most hideous way for no reason other than the thug felt like it.  I feel no sadness for him or his parents.  His parents raised him to be evil with no sense of empathy for a fellow human.  He will get free meals and shelter for what, the next ten years or so?  The girl will live with both the horror of the attack and the visible scars for the rest of her life.</p>

		<p>I am shocked SHOCKED that the LA Times deigned to post a picture of the slasher  &mdash;  only six days after the attack AND call the attack &#8216;premeditated&rsquo; and not the usual &#8216;random act of violence.&rsquo;  Haven&rsquo;t see &#8216;race had absolutely nothing to do with it&rsquo;  &mdash;  but you can bet that will be loudly proclaimed as well by the attempted murderer&rsquo;s lawyer and msm.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t subscribed to the LA Times in a decade, but knowing their track record, I assume this photo was not on the front page, possibly buried in the back.  The story will be dead soon, if it already isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Apparently Thomas had angrily e mailed a number of his professors.</p>
<p>From the main article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;UCLA professor Stephen Frank, who taught Thompson in his Western civilization class, said he told a university administrator 10 months ago that he was concerned about Thompson&rsquo;s mental health after receiving e-mails from the student.</p>
<p>In one of the e-mails, Thompson also accused Frank of taunting him.</p>
<p>Frank said he was told that other professors had reported similar exchanges with Thompson&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thompson was was making excuses for doing poorly on the professor&rsquo;s exam  &mdash;  calling it &#8216;very weighted&rsquo; and claiming that his classmates were &#8216;disruptive&rsquo; and &#8216;making offensive comments&rsquo; directed at him during the test.  He also tried other excuses for his poor performance such as claiming the professor called him &#8216;crazy&rsquo; and &#8216;troubled&rsquo; and accused the professor of taunting him.</p>
<p>Thompson was most likely admitted under AA, way out of his league at UCLA, frustrated and angry.  He blamed his professors and other students for causing his failures, anything but his own shortcomings. </p>
<p>Lawrence Auster called this an Affirmative Action attack and commented:   </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Putting people into situations for which they lack the ability to perform can result in anger, and then violence&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I came across a report issued by the United Nations, for the number of murders per 100,000 of the population. Suprise! Surprise! Surprise! Guess which countries had the highest murder rate? You guessed it&hellip; Black African countries, followed by Latin American countries. But I&rsquo;m sure the findings of the United Nations can be passed off as mere coincidence as respective to racial makeup of those nations leading in the murder rate statistics.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more than with poster # 8. That also goes for the fools who initiated and implemented the 1965 Immigration Act and the consequences of bringing in nothing but 3rd world peoples to our detriment.</p>
<p> Please tell me the benefits that we have gotten from such lunacy?  Diversity?  That has turned out well for us, hasn&rsquo;t it? But we all know by now it was done deliberately to dispossess us of our land and of our heritage. THEY have done to same to our European brothers and sisters.</p>

		<p>The time has come (actually past), to be accused of racism and take back our country.  The politicans have ruined this country with contrived social structure and social equality, along with devaluation of our currency.  From which we won&rsquo;t escape unless we take positive action immediately.</p>
<p>Affirmative action is mental aids, requiring by law to accept less than the best&hellip;that&rsquo;s insanity.</p>

<p>Yes, the Universities routinely (and illegally) get around Prop 209 by finding other factors for admittance, such as family income, or 1st generation college attendance, or &#8220;in top 10% of their graduating class,&#8221; or &#8220;brings a unique perspective,&#8221; or &#8220;has overcome hardship.&#8221;  In other words, admittance to California colleges is still partially based on skin color, rather than academic qualifications.    </p>

		<p>The way a democracy works is that after the people decide on an issue (by voting), then the government impliments that decision. When democracy is thwarted (as in the case of California Prop. 209, which outlawed skin color as a basis for college admittance), then democracy (the will of the people) has been cynically ignored by a small group of people.  democracy is a brilliant system, because it reduces violence by allowing decisions to be based on what most people want,  It is very dangerous when a small cadre of extremists unfairly and illegally thwart that process,  because it frustrates the general population who &#8220;played by the rules.&#8221;   Indeed, some would say that it is the duty of citizens to fight the unjust and cynical trampling of democracy.   </p>
<p>We saw a similar case when Californians overwhelmingly voted to restrict such welfare to legal residents, but the courts and state government blocked that.  Now California is bankrupt. Why have elections and ballots if they will simply be ignored? </p>

I&rsquo;m sorry, but my ancesters didn&rsquo;t sign up for these kind of experiences when they came over from Ireland and England and Germany! FYI, did anyone hear about Michael Brewer and the thugs that set him on fire in Miami? He&rsquo;s only 15 years old and it was over a stupid video game! &#8220;No snitching&#8221;, indeed! Google it!

<p>As an aside, the following quotation is from the linked original article, &#8220;Instructors Rushed to Help Stab Victim&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;His second cousin, 17-year-old Akilah Williams, said she was skeptical that Thompson was capable of the attack.</p>
<p>&#8216;He cares about what people think about him too much,&rsquo; Williams told the Los Angeles Times. &#8216;He gets stressed out but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;d do something crazy.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be alone in noticing that even when a black is accused of an apparently unprovoked attack on a white, he receives better press than most of us will ever receive in our lifetimes. </p>

		<p>Responding to SARGE</p>
<p>The press has practiced an extremely biased double-standard for decades. To the extent any crime by a Black against a White victim is either totally ignored, regardless of how heineous&hellip; or at most is downplayed to the maximum. Glossed over and hidden in a back page where few people would notice it.</p>
<p>The press IS CONTROLLED! By those who are majority stockholders or owners. What better proof than that an obscure second-rate Illinois politician could be &#8220;sold&#8221; to the American people as appropriate presidential material in a few short years.</p>

		<p>Sarge and Fed Up are right. I live in metro Atlanta, and our local bleeding-heart rag, the ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, did not mention the race of either party, nor have I heard it on any news channel. However, you can bet our local news channnels and the hypocritical AJC screamed, &#8220;Hate crime!&#8221; when a white thug beat a black woman in front of her child in a south ATL suburb. The NAACP, who defended the Jena 6, protested the possibility of the creep getting bail. Sure, I oppose it, too, but I do not have double standards for different races.</p>

		<p>Any way to find out &#8220;Mr.&#8221; Thompson&rsquo;s grades and / or SAT scores that allowed him into UCLA? After all, whites are shunted off to &#8220;secondary&#8221; UC schools, with UCLA and UC Berkeley doing all they can to admit non-whites, bending policy left and right. And yes, Asians are given preference over whites. The only time Asians are limited is against each other, as in not letting in a Chinese student because there are already a lot Chinese students. But against a white, the Chinese student will get the nod. The whole UC system is becoming a sad joke. Unfortunately we&rsquo;ll be seeing more stories like this as things &#8220;progress&#8221;. </p>
<p>The UC system seems to be actively campaigning to keep white males at less than 10% of the student body at the &#8220;name schools&#8221;. If they can&rsquo;t get enough &#8220;Thompsons&#8221; admitted, they&rsquo;ll be sure to haul in other non-whites, most likely getting a few like Seung-Hui Cho (the Virginia Tech shooter). We need a full collapse now to get whites out of their comfort zone. </p>
