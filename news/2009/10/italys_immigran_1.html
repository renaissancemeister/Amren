			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mathieu Gorse, London Telegraph, October 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A law passed in July tightening immigration policy and making illegal immigration punishable by jail has put a sword of Damocles above the heads of immigrant workers, who have been more likely to be laid off amid the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Those from &#8220;outside the community&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, the European Union  &mdash;  have contributed greatly to north-eastern Italy&rsquo;s economic boom.</p>
<p>&#8220;First we viewed immigration as a problem, then we started to think of it as an opportunity, and now it&rsquo;s a necessity,&#8221; said Mario Cortella, a businessman in the region who heads a small bath accessories company called Kristallux.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our young people don&rsquo;t want to do the jobs that immigrants are doing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this law making the illegal foreigner a criminal, if he loses his job he has to leave within a few months,&#8221; said Said Nejjari, a Moroccan-born union representative.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about people who have lived here for years, who have children at school,&#8221; said Nejjari at the steel mill where he works in nearby Verona.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a very sensitive problem,&#8221; said Cortella, asserting that he did &#8220;everything possible&#8221; to avoid laying off immigrant workers despite the crisis to prevent them from being deported.</p>
<p>At the Kristallux factory, Albanian immigrant Senaj Enver was soldering towel racks.</p>
<p>&#8220;My story is the same for all immigrants. I fled the Albanian regime in 1993 for a better life,&#8221; Enver said, adding that he arrived aboard a dinghy provided by human smugglers.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first it was really hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now I feel like an Italian, and I&rsquo;ve bought a house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrant labour is crucial to the economy of the region.</p>
<p>In Padua province, the immigrant population has risen from two per cent in 2000 to nearly 15 per cent today. At the national level they make up 6.5 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Three in five of Italy&rsquo;s four million or so immigrants live in the north.</p>
<p>Employers aware of their importance have set up training programmes and language courses and helped immigrants find housing so that &#8220;they are not considered workers who should vanish after they&rsquo;ve put in their eight hours&#8221;, Cortella said.</p>
<p>Many immigrants, especially Muslims, face a hostile social environment.</p>
<p>The Northern League party, which helped conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi return to power for a third time last year, is notorious for its anti-immigration stance.</p>
<p>The debate often centres on religion in the predominantly Roman Catholic, conservative region.</p>
<p>Two years ago in Padua, a prominent Northern League figure unleashed a storm of controversy when he led a pig across the site of a future mosque.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a secular state where church bells do not ring at certain hours so as not to disturb people,&#8221; said Verona&rsquo;s Northern League mayor, Flavio Tosi, sitting at his desk with a picture of Pope Benedict XVI behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine a muezzin (the cantor who calls Muslims to prayer) five times a day. That&rsquo;s not possible here,&#8221; Tosi said.</p>
<p>Nejjari said he had the right to remember his roots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Integration is a two-way street. They say that the immigrants are closed, I say it&rsquo;s the Italians who are closed,&#8221; said Nejjari, adding that he was &#8220;disappointed that Italy, which has sent lots of manpower overseas, is not more sensitive to the problems of immigrants.&#8221;<br>

<p>You came to Italy, Italy didn&rsquo;t come to you.  Yes, Italy did have alot of emigration to Canada, United States, Argentina, etc., all Western countries, and I&rsquo;m sure none of it went to Morocco, Ethiopia or the Phillipines.   </p>

<p>I love how the media portray anti-immigration views as deviant or inherently evil. I remember a cricketer Flintoff complained about talking to receptionists on the phone who couldn&rsquo;t speak English. His comments were branded as &#8220;bizarre&#8221;.</p>
<p>It all seems part of a process to manipulate what are acceptable societal attitudes. </p>

Oh, quit apologizing. Apologizing when you&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong is strictly for wimps. It is not the obligation of you or any other white Westerner to find a job for every last &#8220;worker&#8221; from every last Third World country. </p>
<p><br>
<i>Three in five of Italy&rsquo;s four million or so immigrants live in the north.</i></p>
<p><br>
And why do you suppose that is? Because the weather&rsquo;s nicer or the people are friendlier up there? Of course not   &mdash;   they go to Italy&rsquo;s north because the north is RICHER. Never forget that these immigrants don&rsquo;t really like Whitey, they only like Whitey&rsquo;s money. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand that   &mdash;   and this Torygraph sob story seems determined NOT to understand it   &mdash;   then you&rsquo;ll never understand immigration, either legal or illegal. </p>

		<p>Those of us living in immigrant receiving countries have been hearing these pro-immigration stories our whole lives. Blah, blah, blah. If Italy hasn&rsquo;t already started hearing them, wait for stories about increased police being needed, knifings and shootings in shopping malls, lockdowns in schools, out of control poverty, and extra security needed on buses. School curricula need to be changed, hiring standards need to be made more inclusive, and more diversity is needed on TV. The problems never end. Italy is about to be changed root and branch. If Italians want to know what the future looks like, check out the California malaise. It&rsquo;s a slippery downhill slope and very, very difficult to climb up.</p>

<p>This is because muslims are inherently hostile to non muslims AND THIS! Nejjari said he had the right to remember his roots.</p>
<p>I believe he SHOULD JOIN his roots, about 6 feet down. I again say, muslims are tranquil until they have enough &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; to challenge local, if NOT government LEO and they will  win. HURRAY FOR Italy and it&rsquo;s new immigration laws. Remember, there is no room for a non muslim in a muslim world except as a slave.</p>

		<p>In 2007 Pew Research poll found &#8220;90 per cent of the Italians agreeing that their country should restrict and control the entry of people more than it does today.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked why they felt that way about immigration nearly all said they felt that &#8220;Italy was quickly becoming the landing-point in Europe for many migrants from Africa&#8221;. In 2008 more than 37,000 illegal immigrants arrived by boat.</p>

<p>It sounds to me that this is not just a matter of a tormented social conscience.  No, nore like he&rsquo;s deriving some economic benefit from this   &mdash;   like paying lower wages  to a a more docile or ignorant work force.</p>

		<p>We have lots of laws like this in the USA. Re-entering the USA after being deported is a serious crime, punishable by 20 years in Federal prison. (Just to mention one law.) Do you want to guess how many of these are charged and sentenced accordingly??</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why people all over the Western world can&rsquo;t see the transformation of America from a first class nation to a garbage dump for the third world and act accordingly.  Italy is one of the few nations taking a stand against it.  </p>

<p>Sounds like that guy at the YouTube ambush Republican debates in &#8216;04, begging for &#8216;relief&rsquo; so he could hire more Mexicans. Do these single-minded menchants not get what this is about? But to be fair, if it weren&rsquo;t for featherbedding unions and opressive regulation there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need for masses of third-world world detritus in our countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our young people don&rsquo;t want to do the jobs that immigrants are doing,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>George Bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this law making the illegal foreigner a criminal, if he loses his job he has to leave within a few months,&rdquo; said Said Nejjari, a Moroccan-born union representative.</p>
<p>They went out of their way to find this guy, or he&rsquo;s one of a regular pool from which the press draws it&rsquo;s diversity quotes. The guy comes from some place and winds up being a union rep., a job that typically draws leftist malcontents or organized crime. Which are you, Said? Note also the matter of fact way he dismisses the legitimacy of deporting illegals, as if no one in their right mind has ever thought of such a thing. </p>
<p>&#8220;Many immigrants, especially Muslims, face a hostile social environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because parading a pig at a mosque site is the same or worse than threatening and carrying out violence. Thanks for clearing that up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a secular state where church bells do not ring at certain hours so as not to disturb people,&rdquo; said Verona&rsquo;s Northern League mayor, Flavio Tosi, sitting at his desk with a picture of Pope Benedict XVI behind him.<br>
&ldquo;Imagine a muezzin (the cantor who calls Muslims to prayer) five times a day. That&rsquo;s not possible here,&rdquo; Tosi said.</p>
<p>Ask the people of Hamtramck. </p>
<p>Substitute Mexican for Muslim, the U.S. for Italy, Gutierrez for Nejjari and California for Padua and we have a cut-and-paste sotry for the San Jose Mercury News. Why don&rsquo;t these outlets just get some software to cut-and-paste these stories. Then they could lay off even more staff.</p>

Yes, that is a very perceptive point!   In my experience, they are almost invariably one or the other. In the case of coloreds, it&rsquo;s the former. With whites, it&rsquo;s the latter.  Both are trouble-making agitators and organizers.</p>
