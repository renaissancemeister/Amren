			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Archibald, Birmingham News (Alabama), October 29, 2009, 5:28AM</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The reading of the verdict was just a formality.</p>
<p>From the moment defense lawyer Mike Rasmussen tapped his client on the shoulder and said three words, it was just ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a verdict,&#8221; he said to then-Mayor Larry Langford.</p>
<p>And that was all anyone needed know.</p>
<p>For it was less than two hours into deliberations. Minus a jury smoke break or two, a restroom trip and selection of a jury foreman, and it was barely enough time to read sixty counts of his indictment, much less debate their merits.</p>
<p>If there was a verdict in that time, everyone knew what it would be.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t break the tension as the verdict came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guilty.&#8221; &#8220;Guilty.&#8221; &#8220;Guilty.&#8221; &#8220;Guilty.&#8221; &#8220;Guilty.&#8221; On and on it went.</p>
<p>The evidence was overwhelming. The verdict irrefutable. Justice was done.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seconds after stepping from the courtroom  &mdash;  with Melva beside him and the weight of prison on his shoulders  &mdash;  Langford met a throng of reporters asking his thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For in the moments that followed, Mrs. Langford&rsquo;s emotions overflowed. She ripped into the racial state of Alabama and the Justice Department, and claimed racial prosecution in a way that her husband, until then, had avoided.</p>
<p>It was an emotional response at a difficult time, and it began to divide the community immediately. What it really was was just more sadness, more pain trickling from the wounds of our mistakes.</p>

		<p> If the evidence was overwhelming and the verdict irrefutable, then why all the weeping and hand-wringing for this criminal? Would the reporter have been so heart-sick about the situation if the guy had been White? And by the way, what color is the reporter? Maybe he&rsquo;s just taking up for one of his &#8220;bruthuhs,&#8221; playing dat trusty ole race card for all its worth.</p>
<p> My mother used to say, &#8220;If you dance, you have to pay the piper.&#8221; But this guy, like so many blacks, wants to cut a rug, then swagger out, free as a bird. I have no sympathy for him   &mdash;   none. He got himself into it; now let him live with his decisions, freely made. </p>

		<p>In all my forty years of life, I do not believe I have ever yet witnessed a Black or group of Blacks take full responsibility for ANY misdoing or malfeasance whatsoever. These people are also incapable of expressing any genuine remorse or contrition. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason blacks go into politics, for the graft. <br>
To qualify for office, you need only an anti-white reputation and a big mouth and, of course, the race card in the back pocket.<br>

		<p>The second question came from NBC 13 reporter Jon Paepcke. No. It wasn&rsquo;t a question. It was a a jab, a kick in the gut to a man who was already down.</p>
<p>What did the guy say?</p>
<p>What does this mean for Birmingham&rsquo;s chances for the 2020 Olympics?</p>
<p>What is this, the Daily Show? It was vile, pointless and inappropriate.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p> If you&rsquo;ve lived in Birmingham, as I have, you would have ripped a stitch hearing that one.  As for the article, I&rsquo;ll decline this opportunity to [once again] feel guilty over slavery, thanks.  As for feeling sorry for Langford  &mdash;  he was a crook who made his own bed.  Too many bad things happening right now to decent people to waste tears on a scoundrel.</p>

		<p>He should appeal his convictions for lack of counsel! Any attorney who sees this guys charges and knows how guilty he is and does NOT work some plea agreement out is clearly not a capable lawyer. To stand there and take charge after charge, thats insanity! Wonder who represented him? </p>

		<p>What was this man charged with?  Why does every case involving a black defendant have to be out of &#8220;racism&#8221;?  And why do blacks, as a race, note take any responsibility for their own actions and failures in life?  Why do they always need sympathy, &#8220;uplifting&#8221;, and to blame all their problems on slavery or white people?  Grow up! </p>
