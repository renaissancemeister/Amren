			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>UPI, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan told an audience in Memphis he believes the H1N1 flu vaccine was developed to kill people, a witness said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earth can&rsquo;t take 6.5 billion people. We just can&rsquo;t feed that many. So what are you going to do? Kill as many as you can. We have to develop a science that kills them and makes it look as though they died from some disease,&#8221; Farrakhan said, adding that many wise people won&rsquo;t take the vaccine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farrakhan told listeners not to become complacent as a result of Barack Obama&rsquo;s election as the United States&rsquo; first black president, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to understand that he was voted in to take on the affairs of a nation, not yours and mine. He is the American president, not the black president,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>I think Farrakhan&rsquo;s angle is that H1N1 was bioengineered to kill black people.  I think it&rsquo;s not beyond the realm of possibility that AQ cooked up H1N1, planted it in Mexico, knowing the US-Mexico open border, on the hopes that it will kill Americans/infidels/crusaders of all races.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am seeing a lot of anecdotal evidence that H1N1 is hitting blacks the hardest.  (Morris Dees will promptly sue the H1N1 virus.)  Several mostly black school in St. Louis are closed for awhile b/c so many kids are so sick, and last month, a football game between two HBCUs was called off b/c about half the roster of one of the schools was down with H1N1.</p>

		<p> We have a habit of getting plagues whenever the population density gets too heavy. My gut feeling is that this is a man made disease and it&rsquo;s going to raise hell in third world countries where AIDS is endemic and healthcare is usually the local witchdoctor equivalent.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t be surprised if a lot of your friends and neighbors die from complications of this and AIDS as this will take out the weakened immune systems first and there are literally 1000&rsquo;s of people who are HIV positive and don&rsquo;t even know it.</p>

		<p>First he say H1N1 was designed to kill people, because the Earth can&rsquo;t take anymore, then he says don&rsquo;t take the flu shot against it. Would it be too much of a leap to say Farrakhan is trying to get people killed with his suggestions?</p>

		<p>I saw a post on another blog site a few weeks ago that claimed the H1N1 was taking a much higher toll on hispanics and blacks than whites or asians. I have not seen anything to verify the claim and I have tried to look up deaths by race with no real luck.</p>
<p>If it was in fact true I would bet someone like Farrakhan and Rev Wright would have started screaming about it already though as some kind of cloak and dagger thing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Farrakhan: H1N1 flu vaccine developed to kill people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but the real villain is the white government that introduced drugs and aids into black areas to kill them off.  Too, whoever first made Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake made it black, because he/she was a racist, just as the scientist was who claimed there are problems in the universe with black holes.</p>
<p>Honkies have to get up pretty early to put one over on Calypso Louie.  He didn&rsquo;t make all those trips to the moon in his spaceship just to see blacks fall victim to one of whitey&rsquo;s schemes to do them all in.</p>
<p>And that goes for the past too.  He is fully aware French soldiers shot the nose off the Sphinx in Egypt, because it had a broad flat nose, making it obvious the brothers built the pyramids.  But whitey wanted it all covered up, just as he has covered up all the accomplishments of the brilliant black geniuses throughout mankind&rsquo;s history. </p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s not the only one suspicious about it. I&rsquo;m not trying to dissuade anyone from practicing preventative health but this vaccine and Swine Flu are getting more attention than Obama, and that&rsquo;s saying alot.  There always talking about how deadly it could be and many of the radio and TV hosts are telling people to get the vaccination.  They passed a list around at work for people to sign up to get it and I was close to being the last person to see it.  No one signed up for it.  They then announced on the day they were giving them that they had ran out of vaccine because of heavy demand!  Then I hear the same thing in the media about shortages nationwide.  Now they&rsquo;re saying they have plenty and that there are lines out the door at the local Health Department.  It would be interesting to take a drive by the place to see if they&rsquo;re faking interest in people getting vaccinated.  </p>

		<p>Was the new flu designed to wipe out people in Third World countries? Well&hellip; the idea is not totally implausible. The Earth is becoming overpopulated, and people in the Third World keep reproducing at very high rates. Maybe someone decided to reduce the size of certain populations&hellip;</p>
<p>But, no, I think that sounds too much like a Robin Cook novel to be true.</p>
<p>Louis Farakhan, I think, is WAY out of his area of expertise (if he really has any), when making such declarations, though!</p>

<p>Yes, and of course the fact that artists painted the Spynx without a nose long before Napolean&rsquo;s arrival is proof that the diabolical whitey has developed a time machine to go back in time and cover up his crimes!</p>

		<p>I think it is well established that the H1N1 flu virus was created by Yakub in his secret laboratory on the island of Patmos.  It was his second great infliction of evil upon other blacks, after the creation of the white blue eyed devil.</p>

		<p>Millions of black africans in africa die every year because of a combination of poor farming practices and recurring droughts but any attempt in the UK to produce drought resistant crops to alleviate this suffering are attacked by those &#8216;tree-huggers&rsquo; who consider such genetic modifications as &#8216;frankenstein foods&rsquo; and do their best to destroy trial crops and burn down laboratories. This is no different to Farrakhan&rsquo;s claims that jabs are a plot to destroy the black race and parallels the teaching of traditional leaders in africa who tell their people to refuse measles and polio jabs for the same reason. I suppose all this is a direct result of the failure of the black race to carry out their own research and so produce their own solutions to solve their own problems then criticise the White race for taking the lead, as usual. The day will come when a specific deadly genetic disease will sweep the world and affect only blacks; HIV and AIDS will pale in comparison. This is not an impossible scenario as sickle-cell anemia affects blacks but sufferers are immune to malaria, although this is not a recommended method of avoiding the latter.</p>

This is another one of his crazy &#8220;white man/Jew&#8221; conspiracy theories he&rsquo;s concocted.  What&rsquo;s sad is that most blacks are dumb enough they listen to him.</p>

If people lived correctly and kept their immune system working properly, they wouldn&rsquo;t be susceptable to every bug that came along.

		<p>I&rsquo;m no Farrakhan fan but he could be right and notice he didn&rsquo;t refer to &#8220;black people&#8221; as being the only victims. We spend billions each year feeding third world nations which only helps produce even more babies to suffer &amp; further consume the worlds diminishing resources. Make no mistake about it, our respective world leaders would sacrifice us all to protect their own best interests.</p>

		<p>Well that&rsquo;s it, Farrakhan has finally ripped the lid off the conspiracy all of us vicious blue-eyed devils have been in on for all these years. At first I was upset, but upon reflection I&rsquo;ve had a change of heart and wish to alert all of our darker cousins who may be reading this of all the other &#8220;drugs&#8221;  that us descendants of Yakub have secretly been poisoning  people of color with for hundreds and hundreds of years:</p>
<p>Quinine<br>
Doxycycline<br>
Insulin<br>
Clofazimine<br>
Amoxicillin<br>
Ampicillin<br>
Pennicillin<br>
Streptomycin<br>
Diloxanide<br>
Pentamidine<br>
Hydrodiuril<br>
Norvasc<br>
Tums</p>
<p>Really, to be on the safe side I&rsquo;d recommend avoiding pretty much all &#8220;medications&#8221; prescribed by &#8220;doctors&#8221; and stick with the offerings of your local herbalist. And if, God forbid, any one of you end up in the emergency room or I.C.U. at some point, you might want to ask yourself &#8220;What exactly are these grafted snakes putting into me through these IVs/GI tubes/cranial shunts?&#8221; Probably best to just remove them as soon as you have the strength. Better safe than sorry! </p>
<p>Whew, glad I got that off my chest! Again, really sorry about the whole conspiracy thing, we won&rsquo;t let it happen again. <br>

		<p>As much as I despise Mr. Farrahkan because is a racist through and through, I have to admit that I agree with him on these vaccinations.  I have never gotten a flu shot and I don&rsquo;t intend on getting the H1N1 shot.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I quite agree 100% that its a plot to kill off millions of people but I do believe that it&rsquo;s just a ploy for pharmaceutical companies to make more money.  And why would anyone would to have a virus deliberately injected into their body and there is no guarantee that you still won&rsquo;t get the flu.</p>
<p>Of course, Farrahkan and others like him believe that every time there&rsquo;s a serious disease out there, it was engineered to kill black people and that&rsquo;s stupid.  </p>

		<p>The world&rsquo;s dimmest race strikes again!  Actually, Shelby Steele originally used that phrase, not me.  Anyway, the stuff blacks come up with is simply amazing. Let me see if I remeber correctly these myths:  The CIA is responsible for the drug epidemic in black ghettos, AIDs was invented by whites.  Yeah never mind that the World Health Organization confirmed that AIDs came out of Africa&hellip;And now the nasty, evil white man is up to it again. Blacks seem to love all of these myths to excuse their many failures.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re proof of this is&hellip;.?  It&rsquo;s funny, blacks like you claim whites are holding you back and are &#8220;evil&#8221;, yet you&rsquo;re always whining and begging to us for something.  </p>
<p><b> Too, whoever first made Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake made it black, because he/she was a racist, just as the scientist was who claimed there are problems in the universe with black holes.</b></p>
<p>Oh my god!  I don&rsquo;t believe what I just read.  Are you blacks bigots really that stupid?  I laugh at how gullible you are.  I really do.  And the part that the white race was created in a science lab is always so ridiculous that I can&rsquo;t even believe how Malcolm X was so dumb to believe that.  I know how you black racists think because I&rsquo;ve read Malcolm X&rsquo;s autobiography from front to cover, so don&rsquo;t try to tell me that I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p><b>Honkies have to get up pretty early to put one over on Calypso Louie. He didn&rsquo;t make all those trips to the moon in his spaceship just to see blacks fall victim to one of whitey&rsquo;s schemes to do them all in.</b></p>
<p>Yes, he really flew up in a spaceship and talked to a dead man.  I mean, it&rsquo;s true because the &#8220;honorable&#8221; Farrakhan said that, right?  So if I said that I talked to a green frog and he told me to start a new religion, does that make it true? </p>
<p>And another thing on this subject, isn&rsquo;t it kind of ironic that you black nationalists say that you are superior to whites, yet you claim we are decievers and oppressors?  I mean, how can one be superior to you, yet be able to be causing all these problems and misery in your life?  Still waiting for an answer on that.</p>
<p><b>And that goes for the past too. He is fully aware French soldiers shot the nose off the Sphinx in Egypt, because it had a broad flat nose, making it obvious the brothers built the pyramids.

<p>And the proof for this is&hellip;.?   None, just like the claim that &#8220;whites are brining drugs into the black neighborhoods.&#8221;  You&rsquo;re the same blacks that whine &#8220;They (whites) don&rsquo;t care what goes on in our neighborhood&#8221;, but then when we do try to uplift you with our tax dollars, you call us racists and spit in our faces.  Damned if you do; damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>How low can you go, Calypso Louie? You should consult with local witch doctors about medical matters instead of relying on da white debil for cures. Maybe a potion made with eye of newt and bat&rsquo;s wing will do the trick. We all know about the medical miracles that African shamans have bestowed on the world, which is why the Dark Continent is disease-free today.<br>

		<p>Farrakhan is sort-of right&hellip;the vaccine is meant to kill people (of all kinds, not just poor), but it is also meant to wound many and thus provide many millions of new customers to drug companies for a lifetime of treatment of their new ailments. And there is a possibility that the DNA in the vaccine will combine with the wild virus to create a &#8220;weaponized&#8221; flu. (OK, take that one with a grain of salt.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not buying this Swine Flu/vaccine hype, and I would rather be arrested and quarantined than take the vaccine. </p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m on Farrakhans side on this rare occasion. I know he&rsquo;s not very good company, but the man has to be right once in a while, huh?</p>

		<p>Calypso Louie has just proven the adage that a stopped clock is right twice a day. There&rsquo;s a lot about this whole swine flu scare/hype that stinks worse than burned rubber and has nothing to do with race; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yggx2rq" rel="nofollow">go here</a> for some thought-provoking articles. I recall the 1976 edition of this hoopla, and the vaccine killed &amp; injured far more people than the disease. And ask yourself why, if the &#8220;new and improved&#8221; vaccine is supposedly so safe, Congress gave the drug makers immunity from liability for any side effects (irony can be pretty ironic) and half of all British doctors have refused it.</p>
<p>When in the USAF, I was forced (like everyone else in the military) to get an annual flu shot. At least half of them made me sick to some extent, and one morphed into severe bronchitis. As a result I swore never to get another flu shot after leaving the USAF. In the intervening 22 years, I&rsquo;ve had one or two mild cases and one nasty case. And thanks to that earlier shot, I&rsquo;m now more susceptible to bronchitis, which I&rsquo;d never had before.</p>

		<p>Why is everyone attacking Farrakhan, a black nationalist that wants a separate homeland for his race?  Isn&rsquo;t that what we want as well?  Why not join forces to achieve our goals?  As for the flu vaccine, there&rsquo;s too much media coverage on it and it makes me suspicious as well. </p>

<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but we shouln&rsquo;t be making common cause with any black muslims. Yes, there&rsquo;re out for a separate homeland like us, but they also want to kill us. There is no common ground between our two points of view.</p>
<p>Take care and have a good day.</p>

		<p>I seldom agree with Lewis Farrakhan, but even a broken clock will give the correct time twice a day. His suspicions of the H1N1 flu vaccine are very well justified, whether it was &#8220;designed to kill people&#8221; or not. </p>
<p>Vaccination  &mdash;  and vaccine manufacture and storage  &mdash;  is far from an exact science, and there are indeed serious risks to many, perhaps even most recipients, and also there are likely to be side effects  &mdash;  as with most products of the pharmatoxin industry  &mdash;  at least as bad as the flu, or other disease it is intended to treat.</p>
<p>Treatment of diseases by the pharmatoxin industry  &mdash;  and its captives in the AMA  &mdash;  primarily consists of symptom abatement. There is little or no concern with actual cure, or with healing the underlying condition(s). There is also no concern with serious (sometimes fatal) &#8220;side effects&#8221;. </p>
<p>A sound immune system is a better protection against H1N1 than any vaccine, especially one which is being produced and distributed under the shady and questionable manner government authorized manner which we are seeing here!</p>
<p>Brother Farrakhan has made a right call on this one!</p>
<p>PEACE AND FREEDOM!!<br>

<p>Not to say he doesn&rsquo;t attack White Europeans but most of the disparaging things I&rsquo;ve heard coming out of Farrakhans <br>
mouth were directed towards a certain group.  They might offend the average Manhattanite but not anyone else.  There&rsquo;s an old adage that says the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my enemy.  Words of wisdom that should be applied to our Middle East policy.</p>

<p>1. Because of the double standard.  When whites want the same thing, white liberals (and blacks, too) call us &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;uneducated&#8221; and force their will upon us.</p>
<p>2. Black muslims and black nationalists are hypocrites and all talk.  They say they want to be free from whites, yet they live around whites, take part in white society, and blame us for their problems.  </p>
<p>3. As another poster pointed out, black muslims want all whites wiped off the face of the planet.  What&rsquo;s going on in Zimbabwe is exactly what Farrakhan would do if he were president of the United States.  Make no mistake about it!</p>
<p>The day Farrakhan and all the other black nationalists like him put their money where their mouth is and move back to Africa without asking any help from the West (white nations), then I will have respect for them.</p>

		<p>I have ties to the Pulmonology community in a poor area. The government is pressing everyone receive their H1N1 flue shots and mysteriously the people are becoming gravely sick. I think F is a racist but I agree with him on this one. The recession has put such a strain in the US alone with people on government assistance, it is much cheaper to weed out the sick, poor and disabled with a shot designed to eliminate the week than it is to support them financially and continue the economical strain on the country.</p>
