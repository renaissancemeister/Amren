<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091010/US.Medgar.Evers.Navy/">Navy Honors Civil Rights Martyr Medgar Evers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Wagster Pettus, Comcast News, October 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The widow of slain civil-rights pioneer Medgar Evers fought tears Friday as Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, a former Mississippi governor, announced he&rsquo;s naming a new Navy supply ship for Evers&rsquo; late husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of those who will serve on this ship and those who will see it in different parts of the world. And perhaps they, too, will come to know who Medgar Evers was and what he stood for,&#8221; Myrlie Evers-Williams said at Jackson State University, where Mabus made the announcement.</p>
<p>Evers was Mississippi field secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People when he was assassinated outside his Jackson home on June 12, 1963. He was 37.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The USNS Medgar Evers will be built at General Dynamics NASSCO in San Diego, and Mabus said construction of the 689-foot vessel would take up to two years. The ship will deliver food, ammunition and parts to other ships at sea.</p>
<p>During the 1950s and early 1960s, Medgar Evers organized nonviolent protests, voter registration drives and boycotts in his home state.</p>

<p>Do you want to puke because I do!</p>
<p>And who is it that says it&rsquo;s us Yankees who do all the selling out and groveling?  And, since I&rsquo;m on the subject, two of the biggest race traitors to hold the office of the presidency are two good ole boys   &mdash;   Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton!!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not where you&rsquo;re born but what&rsquo;s in your head.  I am tired of Southerners looking at me like I&rsquo;m the enemy when I have more in common with them than the two scoundrels named above.<br>

Reminds me of &#8220;Acorn&#8221;. Be nice to try an all Black crew on that ship. I can see many trips (humanitarian) to Afica in this supply ships future.</p>

		<p>Medgar Evans if famous for being black and getting shot by a White thug.  I wonder how many ships the Navy would have if each one was named for a black who was shot by a black thug?</p>

		<p>  There is a wedge being driven between southern conservatives and northern conservatives and it is no accident . The Civil War was an American tragedy not some Holy Grail achieved by abolitionist and former slaves . It didn&rsquo;t have to happen . Lincoln was wrong and should not have pursued it but he correctly identified the catalyst of the conflict and was fixing to send them packing . Unfortunately he was overwhelmed by circumstances and plan A got sidelined .Slavery was a dying institution . Some Confederates fled to Brazil with their slaves and before the turn of the century slavery ended there too, with no war . Look at those liberals today flying the American flag . But if you can remember the Vietnam era, you know better . Then, southern symbols almost never came up but the American flag did . The left was burning it or trashing it every chance they got or flying NVA or Viet Cong flags every chance they got . So when you see the left flying Old Glory today, don&rsquo;t let them fool you .They fly it only as a matter of expediency . Their patriotism runs no deeper than where their left wing ideology takes over . Divide and conquer, first bring the south down and then they will turn their attentions to the rest of patriotic, sensible America .Just like they have already tried once during the Vietnam era . Don&rsquo;t let them do it . Don&rsquo;t let them usurp your flag and don&rsquo;t let them divide the northern  conservatives and southern conservatives . When you see the left flying the American flag, think&hellip;! You know they have been told to fly it, and when they achieve their goal, they&rsquo;ll stop flying it . All you have to do is look back to the Vietnam era and you can easily separate the chaff from the wheat . </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor oh having a ship named the &#8220;U.S.S. Robert Heinlein.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man arguably did more than any other individual to jump start the U.S. space program. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for books like <i>Have Space Suit,Will Travel</i>,<i>Rocket Ship Galileo</i> and a host of others,school kids wouldn&rsquo;t have been inspired to go to work for NASA,Rockwell,Honeywell,and all the other places that made massive contributions to the space program.</p>
<p>Did the early astronauts read those books? I doubt it-the early astronauts were test pilot types,and a lot of them were war veterans. Not exactly the personality profile that could sit for hours with their nose in a book.</p>
<p>But a lot of people forget-or don&rsquo;t know-that those hair-on-fire pilots riding the flaming totem poles were backed up by a bunch of very smart,very hardworking nerdy guys,with black framed glasses,and pocket protectors,and slide rules in their desks,or in their hands. And it was the nerdy guys-largely inspired by  Heinlein-who built the stuff that the pilots rode.</p>
<p>Not to mention that Heinlein did indeed serve,after graduating from an institution whose standards had not been yet gutted by P.C.</p>
<p>Someone tell me again what Evers did???? I seem to have trouble remembering.</p>

		<p> An above previous commentator made a good suggestion about naming a U.S. naval ship after every black killed by a &#8221; black thug &#8221; ; even better, have a U.S. naval ship named after a &#8221; white killed &#8221; by a black thug &#8221; in America, that is more logical and appropriate because of the disproportionate amount  of taxes paid by &#8221; whites &#8221; in America from day one. If you pay for something, you own it .</p>

		<p>Will we never run out of black &#8220;martyrs and victims&#8221; to name things after?</p>
<p>There must be literally thousands of parks, highways, bridges, and school buildings named after Martin Luther King, a philandering huckster and notorious plagiarizer.  Oh, yes, he even has his own day!</p>
<p>Please help me.  I&rsquo;m trying to compile a list of great black scientists, playwrights, mathematicians, astronomers, philosophers, composers, engineers, architects, chemists, and historically significant military leaders whose names we could put on all manner of ships, bridges, and highways. </p>

		<p>As someone who&rsquo;s never heard of Medgar Evers, and has no inclination to research the history on some black man who is likely recognized for either doing something illegal or something anyone could do(sitting on the back of a bus, plagiarizing, etc), I&rsquo;m a bit disgusted that we couldn&rsquo;t name it after an actual American hero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we can find some famous white man or woman who ran supplies to needy troops in a war to name the ship after instead of a black malcontent.</p>
<p>Besides, blacks don&rsquo;t deign to enlist in the most dangerous army/navy/airforce occupations, why should we honor them by naming a ship after them?</p>

<p>Very few blacks served in combat in WWII, most served behind the lines filling unskilled labor support roles, ergo they did not &#8220;fight bravely for their country&#8221;&hellip; <br>

		<p>  There were a lot of young men and even young women who sacrificed a lot more in service to this country than Evers ever did and yet, they do not receive the honor of having a ship named after them . This is just more political correctness run amuck . Evers is a bad choice .</p>

		<p>14 Skip: I doubt that the Navy really wants a USS MLK.  It would have to be, as you said, an aircraft carrier.  Anything less would be an insult to tens of millions of Black Americans, and we couldn&rsquo;t have that.  But, as several posters here have said, the MLK logo on a public place is a magnet to Blacks and a clear warning for Whites to keep away.  Any USS MLK will have Blacks requesting transfer to it, and Whites trying to avoid the same.  The Navy will be handed a whole series of problems.  Will they assign a Black affirmative action Captain, or endure the grumbling from Blacks and media about a White Captain and the Navy&rsquo;s failure to promote Blacks?  Will they accept all the requests for transfer from Blacks with the appropriate ratings to the new ship, or will they turn down the legitimate volunteers and force assign Whites instead?  Will they strip every other ship in the Navy of their few technically qualified Blacks in order to ensure that the USS MLK has the right mix of races operating its engines and its radar?  Will they need to bribe Whites with early promotion to entice them to serve with so many Blacks?  Every personnel decision will be a balancing act between pleasing Blacks and keeping the ship operating.  True, every personnel decision in this country calls for those sorts of political skills, but in the case of an aircraft carrier named after the renowned Nobel Laureate, the task would be greatly magnified.  The expectations of Blacks, the interest of the MSM, the enormous investment and potential hazard a carrier represents, and the difficulty of meeting all these demands, will make it necessary to assign a couple Admirals and their staffs to the job, one for decision-making, and one for explaining the decisions.  The Navy just doesn&rsquo;t need the headache.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine. I have no problem with honoring war veterans.<br>
But by that same token, going by your standard,  I have a number of uncles (several still living) who also served bravely in Europe.  And I&rsquo;m sure there are many thousands of other surviving veterans, if not hundreds of thousands. Can they have  ships named after them too?  After all, it seems only fair.</p>
