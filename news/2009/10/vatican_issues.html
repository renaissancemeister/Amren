			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruno Waterfield, London Telegraph, October 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Irish voters go the polls for a second time on the treaty, &#8220;No&#8221; campaigners have seized on comments made by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, Vatican Secretary of State, during the Pope&rsquo;s visit to the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The comments followed unhappiness in the Vatican that the EU refused to recognise Europe&rsquo;s Christian heritage in the text of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>The EU has also upset Catholics in the past by ruling abortion provision should be treated as a &#8220;medical service&#8221; no different from any other treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individual European countries have their own identity. The EU prescribes its laws or views to them and they do not have to fit with their traditions and history. Some countries are logically resisting this  &mdash;  for example, Ireland,&#8221; said Cardinal Bertone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Europe recognised homosexual couples as equal to marriage, for example, it would go against its own history. And it would be right to stand against it. The Church wants to encourage states in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coir, a Catholic group that has claimed that religious faith and Ireland&rsquo;s anti-abortion laws are under threat from the EU, welcomed the comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very pleased that Cardinal Bertone has come out and said explicitly that the EU is imposing secular values on Ireland,&#8221; said spokesman Brian Hickey. &#8220;It is because the EU has a secular agenda that we are resisting the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>Noel Treanor, the Bishop of Down and Connor, last week lined up with mainstream political parties to tell churchgoers that they could vote for the Lisbon Treaty &#8220;without reserve and in good conscience&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Declan Ganley, the leader of Libertas, which is campaigning for a No vote, said Cardinal Bertone represented the Church&rsquo;s true position.</p>
<p>&#8220;I welcome these comments and encourage all practicing Catholics to take them on board before they cast their ballots,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Irish are voting on the treaty for a second time after rejecting it in a referendum last June.</p>
<p>Brian Cowen, the Irish Prime Minister, has promised voters that he has secured &#8220;legal guarantees&#8221; from the EU that Ireland&rsquo;s traditional Catholic stance on the family and abortion will remain untouched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe has listened to the concerns of the Irish people as expressed by them in last year&rsquo;s vote,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many shoppers in Galway, which registered a strong No vote last year, yesterday (THURS) rejected the claim that Europe, or Mr Cowen, had listened.</p>
<p>Sean Boyle, an unemployed man, aged 27, from Donegal, said: &#8220;It is still the same treaty, nothing has changed. We have already had our say  &mdash;  it was no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorcha O&rsquo;Sullivan, Magaretta Cooney, Georgia Bull, Michelle Daly and Eimear Costello, five Galway based female students, agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&rsquo;t they listen? No still means no,&#8221; said Miss Costello.</p>
<p>Irish bookmakers have predicted a pro-treaty vote, a verdict backed up by opinion polls which give the &#8220;Yes&#8221; camp 55 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is looking like a foregone conclusion at this stage,&#8221; said Leon Blanche of Boylesports, which has already paid out to Yes vote backers.</p>
<p>Michael Martin, Ireland&rsquo;s foreign minister, said the government would beat off popular anger over its handling of the economic and resentment over a rerun referendum to win the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident and hopeful that we will win the vote,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p> How has it come to this? It all reminds me of the story of the frog and the slowly boiling pot. The Irish have always stood firm and unwavering in the darkest of times. And yet, with a long history of bravery and bare-knuckled vigilance, they also appear to be growing weak under the constant barrage of the European Union. Before long, all of the &#8220;western nations&#8221; of Europe will be under the hammer of the EU. Then, Amerika will stand alone against tyranny from within and outside her borders. Multiculturalism has destroyed the free world and poisioned the minds of our youth. There truly is a beast of Biblical proportions, and we are living in the dark times of its reign. I truly fear what will eventually come of freedom loving peoples of the world.</p>

Even if the Nos win, supporters of the EU will call for another vote in the future until they win. At that point, there will be no further opportunities to vote on the issue.</p>

		<p>I agree with Cardinal Bertone.  Nations in Europe (and everywhere else) do have their own identity, traditions and history.  I just wish he would give Cardinal Mahony in Los Angeles a call.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s likely the poll figures that show 55% support for a &#8220;yes&#8221; are as much bunk as US poll figures during elections. The elites must continue their destruction of the White West and they will fix the election if need be. </p>

		<p>Cardinal Bertone should give a call not to just Cardinal Mahony but all the Ameican Cardinal&rsquo;s and Bishop&rsquo;s. From what I hear this guy Mahony in LA is pretty horrible. But there are a lot of them on the East Coast that could give him a run for his money. The Catholic Church, the Pope included is all with the religious and political right when it comes to issues like abortion, gay marriage, and stem cell research but they can sure carry on about all the joy&rsquo;s of diversity, unrestricted immigration, and multiclutualism with the best of the left. I truly believe that at least in this country if 90% of the immigration was from the Far East or South Asia instead of South of the border they wouldn&rsquo;t be so pro immigration. Anybody care to venture a guess as to why?</p>

		<p><b>The EU was spawned through subterfuge and deceit</b><br>
 <br>
Jean Monnet International Financeer (and Founding Father Of The EU)in a letter to a friend 30th April 1952:</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe&rsquo;s nations should be guided towards the super-state <b>without their people understanding what is happening.</b> This can be accomplished by successive steps, each <b>disguised</b> as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Monnet did not say was that this &#8220;Federation&#8221; would also be the end of national sovereignity for the people of Europe.<br>
 <br>
If the Irish vote &#8220;yes&#8221; tomorrow, Europe is irreversibly lost to the internationalist cabal in Brussells. <br>

<p>Quite true. Local governments and school boards pull the same stunt with one tax referendum after another. Their aim is to wear down the people until they finally give in and say &#8220;OK, here&rsquo;s your tax increase. Just leave us alone!&#8221; I call it &#8220;ballot fatigue,&#8221; the equivalent of &#8220;battle fatigue&#8221; in combat. The looters know the people must win every time, while they only have to win once.</p>

<p>Eastern Europe countries are the only remaining true white countries for now, I hope we wake up and Russia will help us rebuild the Iron Cutain again, this time forever.</p>
<p>Western Europe is lost, the damage cannot be reversed, we should focus on enforcing our borders and save the remaining whites from Western Europe.</p>
<p>I hope that Russia will help us isolate from Western Europe and America that are not white anymore.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;If Europe recognised homosexual couples as equal to marriage, for example, it would go against its own history. And it would be right to stand against it. The Church wants to encourage states in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is where The Church lets us down.  By this logic, we ought to return to more medeival practices that are also in our history.  Traditions? - such as the Inquisition and witch burnings?  How about some new expulsions of Jews and perhaps some mass killings?  I was visiting a large castle in Southern France in 1998.  In the dungeon was a special torture device for homosexuals; sawing the offender in half from the crotch cephalically.  Nice traditions&hellip;.</p>
<p>On the othe hand, it is the taught Christian &#8220;goodness&#8221; of Europe that has led it to impale its wrists and ankles upon the cross of Diversity.</p>
<p><br>
So Europe has historically a bipolar psyche.  This shifting between tolerance and intolerance has been supported by the contradictory and self-cancelling aspects of the Christian doctrines and teachings.  It warred against itself for centuries and saw many a white European to his death at the hands of another white European.  So even today, we have a war between the Christian &#8220;do gooder, rescuers of the world&#8221; and &#8220;Those who would carry on the pre-Christian and natural instinct to preserve itself, but constantly running up against the hypocrisy of a religion that actually forbids every aspect of that attempt. </p>
<p>It ought to be enough to just say that Europe is an indigenous white set of nations and cultures that should be recognized and as such at least as important to any anthropoligist as a pygmie tribe in Africa or a cannibal one in New Guinea.</p>

The EU is the worst thing to happen to Europe,and Christian<br>

Ireland, Vote No on the Lisbon Treaty, or your future is<br>

		<p>As with previous EU referenda, &#8220;Yes&#8221; means &#8220;Yes&#8221; but &#8220;No&#8221; simply means &#8220;Wait a While&#8221; until the EU propaganda machine can sway the undecideds. The EU has underhandedly, if not illegally, spent at least £139,000 on propaganda for this referendum.</p>
<p>After this, it may be up to the Czechs to stop the EuSSR. A couple of their MPs have now sued in the Czech courts to have the treaty invalidated. Let&rsquo;s hope they succeed. </p>

		<p>If the Vatican really wants to preserve Ireland&rsquo;s and Europe&rsquo;s Christian heritage and western civilization they should shut down all those nuns, priests and Catholic organizations engaged in bringing in third world legal and illegal immigrants and bogus refugees who are Muslims and bent on destroying the heartland of Christianity and Western civilization.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t some Catholic organizations protesting the razing of the Calais refugee camp?  Are not Catholic priests active in that pro Muslim Franch organization, SOS RACISME?</p>

		<p>Whether the Irish vote &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; tomorrow, Europe is already set on an inevitable course to civil war between Muslims and the indigenous people (with non-Muslims probably supporting the latter).</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Individual European countries have their own identity. The EU prescribes its laws or views to them and they do not have to fit with their traditions and history. Some countries are logically resisting this &mdash; for example, Ireland,&rdquo; said Cardinal Bertone.</p>
<p>  I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. The multinational elites are pushing for a one world government  &mdash;  with them permanently in charge! They want to both flood Europe with cheap Third World labor and completely deconstruct national identities. They want a new controlled, bland, effete, brain-dead United Europe to be exactly like the current United (by force) States. </p>

		<p>NBJ #10 you go to the head of the class. But seriously this one is a NO BRAINER. I can just imagine all these illegal&rsquo;s being Protestant, most if not all of these coward Bishop&rsquo;s would be out in the street demanding that our immigration law&rsquo;s be enforced. Increasing the size of their flock is more important to them than preserving the culture of their country. What a disgrace.</p>

<p>Most of the Church&rsquo;s money comes from North Americans anyway; South Americans (like all Latins) are not noted for being generous with their philanthropy.</p>
<p>But they are noted for their religious devotion. Or call it superstition if you prefer.</p>

		<p>Here are some facts from the Wiki link below. There are many other websites that have the same very low numbers of people executed in the Spanish Inquisition. This is a teddy bear&rsquo;s picnic given the barbarity that occurred in the world in these earlier eras.</p>
<p>&#8221;For example, the Spanish Inquisition, assuredly the most vigorous and corrupt of the various inquisitorial bodies that existed in Europe, held 49,000 trials between 1560-1700 and executed between 3 and 5,000 people&#8221;. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the Church was the state in medieval times &amp; you&rsquo;re <br>
the one who is totally illogical for stating &#8221;Here is where The Church lets us down. By this logic, we ought to return to more medieval practices that are also in our history. Traditions? - such as the Inquisition and witch burnings? How about some new expulsions of Jews and perhaps some mass killings? I was visiting a large castle in Southern France in 1998. In the dungeon was a special torture device for homosexuals; sawing the offender in half from the crotch cephalically&#8221;. - Whiteplight</p>
<p>How does the fact that because the Catholic Church wishes to retain traditional marriage between hetrosexual couples also mean that they also wish to return to other barbaric relics of a bygone age is totally illogical on your part and is the logic of the nut house. The Catholic Church is far from perfect but please don&rsquo;t demonise a European institution by making it out to be far worse than it actually was. Our enemies already do that by ignoring the role of Islam &amp; Blacks themselves in slavery &amp; a thousand other things &amp; this could have been posted by a member of the current EUSSR neo-Marxists who are handing back Europe to Islam. Please try to get your facts straight before posting in future.</p>

		<p>The Catholic church really doesn&rsquo;t seem to care whether its members are White Europeans, Mestizos or Africans.  As a former Catholic I know the Church just needs the number of believers to grow.  So don&rsquo;t count on religious affiliation to save Europe&rsquo;s people from racial inundation.  Better to have a set of beliefs and convictions based on the natural world we know (blood, soil, culture, nation, etc) than the other-world/afterlife of the preachers and priests.  That&rsquo;s a superstitious world we cannot know and which cannot be proven to exist.  For better or worse, technology and logic in these modern times has brought humanity to this intellectual juncture.  Concerning white destiny, the European Union doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot about national, racial or cultural identity.  It only wants power over others to control the world.  By the way, don&rsquo;t count on the &#8220;established&#8221; political parties in Europe to save that contintent.  As an example, so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; Tories in Britain will just as soon call the British National Party racist as will the leftist Labour party.  In fact some of the Tory MPs (Daniel Hannan included) sound like US Republicrats Lindsey Graham or John McCain when it comes to singing the racial &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; tune.</p>
