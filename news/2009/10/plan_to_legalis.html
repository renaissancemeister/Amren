			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A move to shoot ring-necked parakeets to cut their numbers has been branded &#8216;racist&rsquo; by wildlife experts.</p>
<p>Natural England yesterday announced that from January it will relax rules protecting the exotic birds.</p>
<p>The birds have been blamed for destroying crops and bullying smaller native species in the hunt for food and nesting space.</p>
<p>But London Wildlife Trust said there is &#8216;little evidence&rsquo; that a cull of parakeets  &mdash;  with their bright green plumage, red beaks and ear-piercing screech  &mdash;  is justified.</p>
<p>It added that parakeets, which originate from the Himalayas, are &#8216;as British as curry&rsquo; and represent the London&rsquo;s cultural and historical diversity.</p>
<p>The trust said a cull was &#8216;misguided&rsquo; and feared the move put similar-looking indigenous birds, like the green woodpecker, at risk of being shot in error.</p>
<p>It added: &#8216;Descriptions of them as bullies and pests reflects more on attitudes towards &#8216;foreign species&rsquo; than any evidence to support these views.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mathew Frith, deputy chief executive of London Wildlife Trust: &#8216;The evidence is scant, and our view is that there are already existing licence arrangements that can be used if parakeets are damaging cherry trees, for example, in a farmer&rsquo;s orchard. I think this is just jumping the gun.</p>
<p>&#8216;We also know that green woodpeckers look like parakeets. They&rsquo;re very bright green when they fly. This could be yet another reason for people to cull other birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he added: &#8216;I quite like ring-neck parakeets but I&rsquo;m lucky I don&rsquo;t have to live near a flock. When they fly they look like Spitfires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With up to 40,000 of the wild parrots thought to be in London and the South-East, in areas such as Richmond Park, it feared that they could soon outnumber native species in the way that the red squirrel population has been dominated by grey squirrels.</p>
<p>Matthew Heydon, Natural England&rsquo;s licensing expert, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s true that at the present time the scale of this problem is relatively minor.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is because the birds are relatively limited in their distribution, but as they spread out of London you can expect the problem to get more severe.</p>
<p>&#8216;The closest example is the grey squirrel. Now there isn&rsquo;t a hope in hell of removing the grey squirrel from Britain, and the red squirrel is hanging on by a thread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Heydon warned it was not &#8220;open season&#8221; on parakeets and said the rules would be tightened if too many were killed. But he said one farmer in Cobham had lost enough grapes in a day to make 3,000 bottles of wine after they were eaten by parakeets.</p>
<p>&#8216;If you left a flock of several hundred parakeets in a vineyard for a day, you would probably have no crop left,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Because of their size, the parakeets bully smaller birds and damage trees.</p>
<p>Natural England has announced a new exemption from the Wildlife And Countryside Act 1981 allowing &#8216;owners or occupiers of land&rsquo; or their agents to kill or take the birds, provided it is done in a &#8216;quick and humane manner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>About 40,000 parakeets are thought to be in London and the South-East alone. Legend has it the birds escaped from Shepperton Studios in Surrey, during filming of the 1951 movie The African Queen starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn.</p>
<p>The rocker Jimi Hendrix is also said to have released two parakeets as an alternative symbol of peace in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Other species also added to the &#8216;general licence&rsquo; hit-list include the monk parakeet from South America, which can occasionally be found in the northern Home Counties, the Canada goose and the Egyptian goose.</p>
<p>All three are considered to pose a threat to native wildlife, public health or public safety.</p>
<p>They join gulls, crows and magpies on the list of birds that can be legally shot without special permission, if damage is being done.</p>
<p>Natural England chief executive Helen Phillips said there was a &#8216;vital&rsquo; need to control exotic and non-native species.</p>
<p>&#8216;Non-native species are a major threat to global biodiversity and it is important that licences can operate as an effective tool in helping to tackle the problem,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>However, Matthew Heydon, a licensing expert at Natural England, warned homeowners could not shoot parakeets without special reason.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We don&rsquo;t want people or kids going out with air rifles taking pot-shots at these birds. It has to be done humanely and for a proper purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW?</p>
<p>* No one knows where the UK&rsquo;s wild parrots come from. One theory is that a pair escaped from a container in Heathrow airport.</p>
<p>* Since they started breeding in the wild in 1969, the ring necked parakeet has become London&rsquo;s 15th most common bird.</p>
<p>* They nest so early in the year  &mdash;  often in January  &mdash;  that they use up the good holes and nest boxes, driving away native species such as woodpeckers.</p>
<p>* In Esher, Surrey, one roost has an estimated 7,000 noisy birds.</p>
<p>* Also known as rose necked parakeets, they were kept as pets by the Ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>* The birds originate from the foothills of the Himalayas  &mdash;  so can cope with the chilly British weather.<br>

The LONDON Wildlife Trust can&rsquo;t see the destructiveness of an invasive species to native English birds?</p>
<p>They should have their Trust status revoked.</p>

		<p>It is a pity that protecting the native species only applies to animal. It is also about time some decides to protect the indigenous homo sapiens species, which is very much in the same league as the red squirrel. The red squirrel is on the verge of extinction in England because it is not as aggressive or as prolific a breeder the the imported gray squirrels. There is a very important lesson to be learned here. After thousands of years most indigenous species learn to co-exist and live within the restraints of the environment. Anything not indigenous is rightly called an invasive species.</p>

		<p>Now it&rsquo;s racism if you shoot foreign birds?  Is the madness going to stop or is it going to get worse?  Knowing the situation in Britain I would suspect it&rsquo;s going to get worse.  What are they going to do next, make it a hate crime to kill foreign insects that are brought into the country? (I&rsquo;m not referring to illegals but to the insects they might bring with them)</p>

<p>The same thing can be said for the White race world wide. At least the ring-necked parakeets aren&rsquo;t interbreeding with the local bird population. Maybe someday there will be a captive breading  program for Whites the way we do some endangered species like the American condor. Or maybe just eradicate the White race the way we did smallpox. </p>
<p>I remember a story about Italy trying to save their native wolf population. The problem they had was so many wolves had interbred with feral dogs that there was a shortage of pure wolves. Somehow that sounds familiar.</p>
<p>Anyway the Italian solution was to begin shooting the ones that were them most dog like and allowing the most wolf like to breed in an attempt to reduce the dog genes in the native population. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing British about curry.  I like the game of go, but I don&rsquo;t pretend that it&rsquo;s American.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that the London Wildlife Trust wants Britain&rsquo;s own native species to be displaced by an invasive species.  But that&rsquo;s exactly what our political masters want to have happen to us.</p>

		<p>All of life is competition and struggle. If the native birds or squirrels can&rsquo;t compete and won&rsquo;t struggle for dominance, then tough tweety.</p>
<p>And, the same thing goes for us white people.  If some of us are so weak that we can no longer compete and if we won&rsquo;t struggle in the right way to dominate and if we prefer to just lie down in the snow and go to sleep and never wake up&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s our funeral.</p>
<p>I for one, however, will struggle and compete.</p>

		<p>Here in America, we also have ecological problems with invasive species like European Rock Doves(city pigeons), Starlings, and English Sparrows.  In fact, because of English Sparrows there is a serious decline in our native Blue Bird population.</p>
<p>In Florida, the pet trade has created a serious invasive species problem with Burmese Pythons, parrots(our only native parrot was the now-extinct Carolina Parakeet), Cuban Tree Frogs, and Iguanas.</p>
<p>The sensible solutions to any invasive species problem would be to make arrangements with the countries where these foreign animals come from, to send some of them back, and yes for the benefit of native species conservation, exterminate the rest of them.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who is an animal-rights advocate and vegan, and would absolutely not approve of one idea I proppose: make an arrangement with Great Britain to send some of the English Sparrows back to England and exterminate the rest of the Sparrows to help increase the our native Blue Bird population.  At the same time, the British should send some of the Ring-neck Parakeets back to their Asian countries of origin and exterminate the rest of them.  British enviromentalists should campaign for conservation programs to exterminate every last feral American Grey Squirrel, in order to save their native Red Squirrels.  </p>
<p>But such ideas do make me wonder because there is a major difference between animals-rights advocates like my cousin and environmentalists.  In fact, there are environmentalists, in organzations like the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation, who are hunters.</p>
<p>For example, even in Alaska, not all hunters approve of shooting wolves from airplanes to increase moose populations.  The National Wildlife Federation, the most pro-hunting evironmental organization, is openly opposed to favoring one species over another, as a means to increase prey species for hunters.</p>
<p>It was right to bring wolves back to Yellowstone National Park in 1995.  But wolves were a missing species, not a foreign, invasive species like Ring-neck Parakeets or Starlings.  Prior to 1995, the proposal to bring wolves back to Yellowstone caused a sharp division between hunters like Jim Zumbo, who were against it because they would not tolerate any species that would compete with them for game, and environmentalist-hunters who openly advocated wolf reintroduction.  In fact, some environmentalist-hunters wrote to hunting magazines letter pages, saying they would gladly give up hunting in Wyoming, in order to have wolves for the purpose of restoring Yellowstone&rsquo;s ecological balance.</p>
<p>I am not a hunter myself.  Ecologically, hunting can be good or bad, depending on the circumstances.  My opinion on hunting is that enviromentalists who are hunters, should oppose whatever negative ecological abuses that happen on both the hunting and anti-hunting sides, and that hunting should be done in a way that equally benefits both predator and prey species.</p>
<p>But getting back to the ecological problem of invasive species that this article is about.  I wonder how would environmentalists, both those who hunt and those who do not hunt, react if my proposals to eliminate invasive species by deporting some of them back to their native countries and killing off the rest of them, were publicly and offically proposed?</p>
<p>I know that animal-rights advocates, like my cousin, would be against it!  But how would environmentalists react?</p>

		<p>It has been correctly said that the only constant in the universe is change.  So be it. Any organism that can&rsquo;t adapt to the changes  &mdash;  including many white people  &mdash;  should be replaced by organisms that can adapt and can prosper in any particular environment.<br>
Life is constantly culled to breed up the best.  Nature wants the strong to survive and the weak to perish. </p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m fed up with white weaklings who are pulling the rest of us down.</p>

		<p>This subject like nature herself is filled with implications and interpretations and in being human, the only specie capable of seeing this from a dual stanpoint&hellip; we are naturally integrated with this equation. Apparently the continents were once united to a large degree and broke apart in different time intervals thus manifesting varied fauna of life at different stages of their specific evolutions,.. marsupials for instance. This being the likely unfolding, different locations tended toward specific specie and sub speciations. So we have what are called native species and non native,&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t think either category can be categorically quantified in the absolute sense as nature is usually varied by degree and not absolute distinctions. But as I said we humans are inherently in the middle of this,.. so our opinions are in a sense godlike in that we knowingly (must) sculpt natures ongoing unfolding according to our understanding of what constitutes the best direction. All this being said, for the necessity of abbreviation a spartan conservatism is usually well grounded and this would be the hindrance of human instigated changes as they are unnaturally fast with nature at a great disatvantage in catching up, making ammends in its extremely complex interwoveness. Genetically altered foods for instance may well lead to untold hidden dangers for the same reasons. I visited Yellowstone 20+ yrs ago and was dissapointed to see the fat lethargic elk being tossed bread by blue hairs, both species somewhat caricaturized of what they should be as I saw it..Some yrs later they reintroduced wolves and this remedied the unnatural lethargy in the elk at least, .. to me a good thing. And so with white folk&hellip;What will be our direction?!&hellip;</p>

		<p>In addition to my long winded previous statement&hellip;.In the states here we see red squirrels usually seem more agressive than grey and apparently try to chase down the larger grey squirrels in order to castrate them&hellip; as well we see grey squirrels chasing away black ones of their own specie..more food for thought&hellip;</p>

<p>Perhaps it is time to let the Whites go the way of the dodo, not because we are weak, but because we are too stupid to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>I would like to point out to Frank and others like him that it was it was White people that developed medicines, vaccines and worked to eradicate diseases in the 3rd world. We stopped wars and rushed in food and aid every time a disaster stuck in the 3rd world. Has Africa, India or China ever rushed aid to any victims around the world?</p>
<p>Frank, we kept the weak and dieing alive so that could breed and overwhelm us through sheer numbers. If we had closed our borders and exploited the weaker 3rd world nations, then there would be a lot less Franks in the world.</p>

Frank, what you&rsquo;re talking about is NATURAL selection. What&rsquo;s happening is UN-NATURAL selection.</p>
<p>Each area has evolved particular niches. The species in each area have evolved to compete equally. That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>

		<p>Campaigns of extermination seldom work.</p>
<p>Over fifty years ago there was a nationwide campaign to eradicate the grey squirrel in the U.K. A shotgun cartridge was then threepence and the bounty per squirrel tail was four times that: a shilling back in the days when there were twelve pence in a shilling and twenty shillings in the pound. A lucky shot with an airgun was much cheaper than using a shotgun! </p>
<p>A total failure but a lot of fun for young rural people.</p>
<p>In the fifties there was a capaign to eradicate the fox in Northern Ireland; payment five shillings per fox head. The Royal Ulster Constabulary then cut out the tongues &#8220;to prevent repeated presentation of the same head.&#8221; Supposedly, crafty people were importing fox heads from over the border!</p>
<p>Two successes: eradication of the coypu in England after two decades of unsuccessful efforts and eradication of the musquash [musk rat] in the prewar Irish Free State.  </p>
<p>Australia has feral camels, the only &#8216;wild&rsquo; dromedaries in the world, and every county in the British Isles has mink [their ancestors were farmed as a surefire means for modestly-situated to get immensely rich quickly as fur producers.]</p>
<p>Ring-necked parakeets are handsome birds but can strip an orchard of buds in a matter of hours.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve reread my post #8 and see that I wasn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white. What I was trying to convey is the fact that I&rsquo;m fed up with some of my fellow whites who are too stupid or too weak to struggle to survive and prevail. While I once would have argued that we must try to save these weak ones among us, I now say let them remove their weak genes from the <br>
White gene pool so the rest of us can rebuild a stronger, smarter people.</p>
