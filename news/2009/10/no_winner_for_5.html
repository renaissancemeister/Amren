<h1>No Winner for $5 Million African Leadership Prize</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louise Watt, Yahoo! News, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a snub to recent ex-presidents and heads of state in Africa, organizers of a multimillion-dollar annual prize for good governance on the continent said Monday they had decided not to give out the award this year.</p>
<p>The Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is awarded only to democratically elected heads of state who have left office in the past three years. That requirement limits the pool of contenders, eliminating the continent&rsquo;s strongmen leaders, some of whom have held onto power for decades.</p>
<p>The committee considered &#8220;some credible candidates&#8221; but could not select a winner, said former Botswana President Ketumile Masire, a board member of the group that awards the prize.</p>
<p>Created in 2007 by Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim, the prize awards $5 million over 10 years and $200,000 annually for life thereafter to encourage leadership that improves the prospects of people in the continent.</p>
<p>Ibrahim was asked at a news conference Monday about politicians who meet the award criteria but were not chosen, including former South African President Thabo Mbeki, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Ghanaian President John Kufuor.</p>
<p>Ibrahim, the founder of the African telecommunications company Celtel International, said the foundation had &#8220;full respect&#8221; for those leaders. It was unclear why the committee, which is independent of the foundation&rsquo;s board, was unable to choose one for the prize.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing in places from Senegal to Libya attempts to pass power from father to son, and it&rsquo;s been a year of coups in places like Madagascar and Mauritania and Guinea,&#8221; said Reed Brody, a Brussels-based legal counselor for Human Rights Watch. &#8220;It hasn&rsquo;t been a great year for democracy in Africa. Maybe that&rsquo;s what they were trying to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s prize committee was chaired by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and included Nobel peace laureate Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, and former Irish President Mary Robinson.</p>

Telling isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>An entire continent and yet they can&rsquo;t find one leader worthy of a prize for Achievement in African Leadership.</p>
<p>The only good in this is that the committee took the stand they did and didn&rsquo;t settle for second best. Kudos.</p>

		<p>The only African head of state in recent decades who deserved that award was Ian Smith.</p>
<p>May that great man rest in peace.</p>

		<p>I had a good laugh over this one. I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t give it to Obama, after all he&rsquo;s an Africa leader isn&rsquo;t he? <br>
I suspect &#8220;democratic credentials&#8221; are part of the qualification for this prize, but the truth of the matter is that democracy is a European creation and remains so. The best Africans and most people outside of Europe and N. America can hope for is a dictator that maintains law and order. Hasn&rsquo;t anyone been paying attention to Iraq? &#8220;Democracy&#8221; means chaos in the minds of most 3rd worlders. If a dictator maintains order and manages not to completely loot the economy its a success. Many dictators in Asia, while corrupt, keep their money in their countries. Its a less than efficient allocation of resources, but it&rsquo;s much better than the African scenario (of which Mobutu is the best example) where the dictator moves all &#8220;his&#8221; money to foreign banks. I&rsquo;m not saying Asian dictators don&rsquo;t have Swiss bank accounts, but they have more loyalty to their respective countries than has ever been shown by any of the thugs that rule in Africa. Just compare Marcos&rsquo; Philippines or Suharto&rsquo;s Indonesia to your average African rat hole. They certainly weren&rsquo;t beacons of modernity but they were eons ahead of Africa. <br>
To be fair, there are a few legitimate democracies in East Asia, notably Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. Singapore is basically a one party state (the people seem to like it that way) Taiwan and South Korea were military dictatorships until very recently (within the past 20 years) and Japan is a democracy because the Emperor decreed it so and they literally just last month elected the opposition to power for the first time since the end of WWII. </p>

		<p>They didn&rsquo;t follow the lead of the Nobel committee and give it to Obama?  Obviously, Africans are more realistic than Norwegians.<br>

<p>Thank you for your honesty.  It is indeed a rare commodity in today&rsquo;s world.  Most refreshing.</p>

<p>The Rhodesian folksinger, Clem Tholet, when he passed away in 2004, must have died a very broken-hearted man to see what became of what used to his beloved country.</p>

		<p>I note that Sip Zondi actually compares this &#8220;prize&#8221; to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama.</p>
<p>In other words, one is as worthless as the other (in the case of the Peace Prize, for this year, at least).</p>

		<p>Mo Ibrahim is not the only black african to see things as they really are. Here is an excellent commentary, and, although a little long, it is well worth a serious read. <br>

		<p><i>Really? How many does he lead? What has Ron Paul acheived?</i></p>
<p>He has opened the eyes of many young people to the reality that their Constitution is not being followed.  They now continue to work for liberty and Constitutional government in organizations like The Campaign for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty.  He is the only conservative politician to gain any real following among the under 30 set in many years and is a much needed alternative to Obama.  If people think Republicanism means nothing more than tax cuts and corporate welfare for the rich and endless war, all funded by getting deeper and deeper into debt, it&rsquo;s no wonder so many vote for Democrats.</p>
<p>He has also shown, simply by example, that it is possible for an honest man to get elected to Congress, over and over again, without ever selling out to lobbyists and special interests.<br>
