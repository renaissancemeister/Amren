<h1>Congress Wants to Put Hate-Group Ban Into Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Maze, Navy Times, October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The job of recruiters could get tougher as a result of a provision in the compromise 2010 defense policy bill that bars enlistment of anyone who has been an active participant in an extremist group.</p>
<p>This would include any groups advocating discrimination based on race, sex, creed, religion or national origin, especially if the group advocates to the use of violence  &mdash;  something recruiters will have to screen for if the bill becomes law.</p>
<p>Participation in such groups already is prohibited for current service members by regulation, but the compromise defense bill, HR 2647, also puts the prohibition into law.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives gave final approval to the bill two weeks ago and the Senate is expected to take the bill up in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The House-passed plan called for the immediate discharge of anyone associated with a hate group. For current service members, the House plan had an exception from immediate discharge if a person had previously renounced their membership in a hate group. No exceptions were allowed for recruits who had been associated with hate groups, so even if they had renounced their membership they would have been barred from enlisting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Generally, Defense Department policies have determined that active participation in an extremist group is any involvement that furthers the group&rsquo;s aims, which could be leadership, organizing, fundraising or attending public meetings or demonstrations, even when off-duty.</p>

<p>The radicals are drunk with power and there will be more legislation that will attempt to legislate thoughts.  This kind of raicalism always is responded to by violent backlashes, when critical mass is reached.</p>
<p>And, these leftist fools won&rsquo;t know when critical mass occurs, because they can&rsquo;t perceive of anyone not thinking as they do, nor can they understand that it is the non-whites who have gang-related ties.  Obviously, it&rsquo;s legislation meant only for whites, and when non-whites are proven to belong to hate groups they will be exempted with the same flimsy excuses that are used to exempt them from hate crime laws now. They will simply refuse to recognize their hate group as a hate group.</p>

		<p>This is just idiotic blather from Congress.  Every senior officer with a brain knows what we know about the races.  How many Whites have actually been kicked out for &#8220;active participation in a hate group&#8221;?  <br>
     But I do see some value in this.  World wide, American military units all receive the same order, simultaneously: &#8220;Place (list of MS13 members, Crips, Bloods, other unreliables) under arrest, pending immediate discharge from the service&#8221;, followed by orders to move immediately to secure U.S. borders and place occupied American territory such as Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles under martial law.  </p>

		<p>The only hate group I have ever been a member of was the military. They actually wanted us to go to a foreign land and kill little yellow people that I didn&rsquo;t even know or have anything against.  </p>
<p>All governments and all religions should be considered hate groups because they have all advocated violence against those that think differently than they do. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t advocate violence toward anyone based on anything other than a direct threat to life and liberty. Certain groups do pose a direct threat to life and the general welfare of most of us. This is not hate but a survival instinct. </p>

		<p>Their definition of hate is any white person that is not guilt ridden or that lives in a white neighborhood.  </p>
<p>If you are against affirmative action, if you point out the high crime rate in black neighborhoods, if you question the bias in the mainstream media, you too might be labeled a hater.</p>

		<p>The NAACP favors affirmative action for blacks, i.e., discrimination against non-blacks.  The National Organization for Women favors affirmative action for women, i.e., discrimination against men.  NOW also advocates the killing of fetuses, which is regarded by many as violence.  LULAC, MALDEF, La Raza, and MEChA all favor affirmative action for Hispanics, i.e., discrimination against non-Hispanics.  I&rsquo;m delighted to hear that none of the members of those organizations will be allowed to join the armed forces.</p>

		<p>Sounds like good news to me.  A good way to trim down the military and keep white people from fighting wars that do not in any way help white people.  Congress approves wars, so let them disapprove of my sons going into the military.  The more I think about it the better it gets.</p>

<p>And following &#8220;Tacitus&rsquo;&#8221; comment, even the Romans let the Christians have a chance to recant their beliefs before feeding them to the lions.  Surely there is a first amendment issue here just waiting to be litigated.<br>

<p>Seems to me he still is. BTW, I believe the U.S. Army is about 60% black or better now. Army camps here in the Muddled East look like ghettoes, jive angry rap music plays from most of the armored vehicles as they pass, caps are worn turned sideways and pants are worn in the gangsta way. NO WHITE officer dare say anything, less he end his career abruptly. KBR is also mostly black, as are a number of other government contractors here in the Muddled East, as is ITT Systems, CSA and several others, it&rsquo;s as if the companies get bosus&rsquo; for hiring blacks. There are token whites though, SOMEBODY has to get the work done.</p>

		<p>Whites have won every war America has ever fought.  You can talk about your nesei, tuskeegee airmen or other small groups doing well and you can give out affirmative action medals and promotions all day, whites by the millions have fought the wars and won the peace, either exclusively in the combat arms or overwhelmingly so.  If we are eliminated from the military or refuse to serve, the USA is history.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend the services to any white today as they will do the real fighting and then be discriminated against by their own country.  I tell them, screw the military, don&rsquo;t die for a country that hates you, go make money and babies.  That is the best we can do for our country now, make babies and raise them well.</p>

		<p>I for one, have no problem with what the government would like to do.  They are slitting their own throat.  It has been pointed out already on the comments that for the most part white groups will be the ones cited for exclusion the most.  Black hate groups such as all the gansta types don&rsquo;t have enough organizational identity for police type to recognize who is who unless they have actually been arrested for gang activity.  Felons aren&rsquo;t welcome in the military anyway.  No, it will be primarily whites who have joined various websites, received literature from identified groups via the US Mail, or arrested for misdemeanor activities such as protesting without a permit to assemble, etc.  But who cares?  I am very pessimistic as to whether this country can turn itself around, or even for that matter slow down the rate of socialism that is heading straight into communism.  And make no mistake, it is.  Our leaders would never admit to calling it that, due to the negative connotations, but centralized government control with a priority of limiting liberty, education, and business to what they define as is communism.  Who wants to fight for that?  Not me and mine.  If conscription ever rears its ugly head again in this country, join a hate group and for insurance get a white pride tattoo - they&rsquo;ll never take you.   Tell your sons.</p>

		<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a majority of whites who agree with those &#8220;hateful&#8221; ideologies.  You know, like&hellip;being against illegal immigration, affirmative action, being forced to subsidze socialistic agendas.  Those &#8220;evil&#8221; and &#8220;hateful&#8221; things.  I got a letter in the mail from CofCC.  Since I&rsquo;m still of drafting age, does that mean I can&rsquo;t stand on the front line with a gun in my hand and die for the New World Order agenda?  Darn!  I soooooo had sights set on that.  </p>

<i>The beasts of the field and the birds of the air have their holes and their hiding places; but the men who fight and die for Italy enjoy only the light and the air. Our generals urge their soldiers to fight for the graves and shrines of their ancestors. The appeal is idle and false. You cannot point to a paternal altar. You have no ancestral tomb. You fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others. You are called the masters of the world, but there is not a foot of ground that you can call your own. </i>-  Tiberius Gracchus</p>
