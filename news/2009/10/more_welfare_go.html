<h1><a href="https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/oct/27/more-welfare-going-parents-here-illegally/#comments">More Welfare Going to Parents Here Illegally</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy Pratt, Las Vegas Sun, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Jose] Silva has been without a steady job for a year, one of tens of thousands of workers still reeling from the bottom dropping out of the Las Vegas Valley&rsquo;s construction industry, the region&rsquo;s second-largest employer after tourism.</p>
<p>If approved for assistance, the Silvas will belong to the fastest-growing category of families in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Bearing the confusing government label of &#8220;non-qualified non-citizens,&#8221; this category refers to families with parents who are not U.S. citizens and children who are.</p>
<p>Since the recession began in late 2007, the average monthly caseload of these families has grown 96 percent, according to state records. About 4,250 of these families of mixed immigration status were on the program&rsquo;s rolls in September, making it the second-largest category in TANF, after single-parent households.</p>
<p>It is also the only category in the program where parents apply in their children&rsquo;s name, as opposed to applying in their own. TANF gives monthly checks to the families based on income and the children&rsquo;s status as citizens and does not require parents to demonstrate that they are in the United States legally.</p>
<p>No one has studied the phenomenon, but Christie D. Batson, an assistant professor of sociology at UNLV who has researched immigrant families, figures the exploding numbers may have at least two causes. Children of immigrants have long been one of the demographic groups getting the least amount of social services, despite showing great need, Batson said. This is because illegal immigrant parents often don&rsquo;t know about the benefits, or are afraid they could be deported if they seek them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the past few years there has been a push to better inform these parents, by social service agencies and nonprofits,&#8221; Batson said.</p>
<p>So the numbers could be a result of more immigrant families finding out about social service programs, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute estimated the unemployment rate among Hispanics in Nevada at 16.4 percent for this year&rsquo;s second quarter, the most recent period available. The state&rsquo;s overall unemployment rate was 11.3 percent at the time. It is now 13.3 percent.</p>
<p>In another reflection of the withering economy, the number of households with two parents seeking TANF has also exploded. Enrollment under that category has increased 69 percent since late 2007.</p>

		<p>They came here to do the work we won&rsquo;t do and ended up collecting the welfare we won&rsquo;t collect but will get to pay for. </p>

		<p>They are getting alot more than just welfare. Illegals are granted SECTION 8 housing and make up about 60% of section 8 recipients in LA County alone!!! Do you know how much that costs us??? I will wager a billion a year at least! Then our own elderly and disabled AMERICANS cannot get it due to the hugh numbers of illegals taking the slots. Oh and BTW, I found out that it is mostly Hispanics and Blacks that work where one goes to apply and they are the ones who &#8220;grant&#8221; the vouchers to their own race FIRST! </p>

<p>Well, they better hurry up and enjoy it, because it will be on the chopping block in 2010 when we slide into a DEEP depression.</p>

		<p>Per the 14th Amendment. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, AND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. If a mexican citizen gives birth in the U.S that child is a mexican citizen and not a U.S citizen because the parent falls under the jurisdiction of mexico and not the U.S. Funny how alot of people and politicians think otherwise.</p>

<p>Why on earth do they have to ADVERTISE they are giving away free money and to illegals of all people? Able body adults living off the state is not something that should be encouraged. If they want to live a life of leisure off the state give them the number to the Mexican Embassy and tell them to ask them for their dinero.</p>

		<p>If the parents are mexicans, the children are mexican. This is according to article 30 of the mexican constitution. It is time for mexico to pay for their children.</p>

		<p>The 14th Amendment was never meant to make anchor babies into citizens.</p>
<p>It also was never really ratified, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<p>Soon, disabled Americans and our own elderly will not get medical treatment as it will be rationed out in favor of illegal immigrants for their multiple births, knife wound, TB, HIV, chagas disease, parasites, high rates of obesity, diabetes and more.</p>
<p>Our disabled American veterans and elderly will be told to &#8216;go home and take an aspirin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I know it&rsquo;s just a crazy world&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing crazy about any of this, it is a well thought-out, deliberate plan to strip Whites of their land and wealth, wrest control of the US economy and government, and turn it into a NWO authoritarian police state that the old Soviet bosses would be proud of.</p>
<p>Jerks like tim wise and the msm argue that it is perfectly normal for Whites to bow down and cede their land, possessions and creations to less intelligent groups and to stop complaining when illegal colonists cross the border and demand we shower them with special favors and privileges over our own people.</p>
<p>It is not crazy  &mdash;  what has been done to Whites, the creators of this country, is pure evil.</p>

<p>This is an out and out lie. Rubbish. Immigrants have been pouring in from Latin America, especially Mexico, because they know they will get the freebies. I read and write fluent Spanish, and in the late 80&rsquo;s here in L.A. I can remember reading flyers, written in very poor Spanish, that were being handed out by various storefront evangelical churches run by Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and the like. The flyers explained how to get welfare (by using your &#8216;American born&rsquo; baby), how to get housing assistance, food stamps, you name it. The &#8220;academic&#8221; making the statement / claims above is an absolute liar. You can bet she knows exactly what is going. Any &#8220;explosion&#8221; would simply be from a population explosion among the illegals. </p>

<p>These are handed out at the schools as well  &mdash;   advertising for housing assistance, WIC and AFCD services, free pre-natal care, plus special race and/or language-based counselors that will help &#8216;recent immigrants&rsquo; apply for and receive social services. </p>
<p>They are explicitly assured &#8216;immigration status does not matter&rsquo;, &#8216;no questions will be asked&rsquo; and that it is against US Federal laws for schools or any other social service to call &#8216;La Migra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is anyone out there still wondering why California&rsquo;s economy is collapsing?</p>
