<h1>Israeli Drive to Prevent Jewish Girls Dating Arabs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Cook, World Bulletin (Istanbul), September 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local authority in Israel has announced that it is establishing a special team of youth counsellors and psychologists whose job it will be to identify young Jewish women who are dating Arab men and &#8220;rescue&#8221; them.</p>
<p>The move by the municipality of Petah Tikva, a city close to Tel Aviv, is the latest in a series of separate  &mdash;  and little discussed  &mdash;  initiatives from official bodies, rabbis, private organisations and groups of Israeli residents to try to prevent interracial dating and marriage.</p>
<p>In a related development, the Israeli media reported this month that residents of Pisgat Zeev, a large Jewish settlement in the midst of Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, had formed a vigilante-style patrol to stop Arab men from mixing with local Jewish girls.</p>
<p>Hostility to intimate relationships developing across Israel&rsquo;s ethnic divide is shared by many Israeli Jews, who regard such behaviour as a threat to the state&rsquo;s Jewishness. One of the few polls on the subject, in 2007, found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage should be equated with &#8220;national treason&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since the state&rsquo;s founding in 1948, analysts have noted, a series of legal and administrative measures have been taken by Israel to limit the possibilities of close links developing between Jewish and Arab citizens, the latter comprising a fifth of the population.</p>
<p>Largely segregated communities and separate education systems mean that there are few opportunities for young Arabs and Jews to become familiarised with each other. Even in the handful of &#8220;mixed cities&#8221;, Arab residents are usually confined to separate neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>In addition, civil marriage is banned in Israel, meaning that in the small number of cases where Jews and Arabs want to wed, they can do so only by leaving the country for a ceremony abroad. The marriage is recognised on the couple&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>Dr Yuval Yonay, a sociologist at Haifa University, said the number of interracial marriages was &#8220;too small to be studied&#8221;. &#8220;Separation between Jews and Arabs is so ingrained in Israeli society, it is surprising that anyone manages to escape these central controls.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team in Petah Tikva, a Jewish city of 200,000 residents, was created in direct response to news that two Jewish girls, aged 17 and 19, were accompanying a group of young Arab men when they allegedly beat a Jewish man, Leonard Karp, to death last month on a Tel Aviv beach. The older girl was from Petah Tikva.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; involvement with the Arab youths has revived general concern that a once-firm taboo against interracial dating is beginning to erode among some young people.</p>
<p>In sentiments widely shared, Mr Hakak, a spokesman for Petah Tikva municipality, said &#8220;Russian girls&#8221;, young Jewish women whose parents arrived in Israel over the past two decades, since the former Soviet Union collapsed, were particularly vulnerable to the attention of Arab men.</p>
<p>Dr Yonay said Russian women were less closed to the idea of relationships with Arab men because they &#8220;did not undergo the religious and Zionist education&#8221; to which more established Israeli Jews were subject.</p>
<p>Mr Hakak said the municipality had created a hotline that parents and friends of the Jewish women could use to inform on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t tell the girls what to do but we can send a psychologist to their home to offer them and their parents advice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Motti Zaft, the deputy mayor, told the Ynet website that the municipality was also cracking down on city homeowners who illegally subdivide apartments to rent them cheaply to single Arab men looking for work in the Tel Aviv area. He estimated that several hundred Arab men had moved into the city as a result.</p>
<p>Petah Tikva&rsquo;s hostility to Arab men mixing with local Jewish women is shared by other communities.</p>
<p>In Pisgat Zeev, a settlement of 40,000 Jews, some 35 Jewish men are reported to belong to a patrol known as &#8220;Fire for Judaism&#8221; that tries to stop interracial dating.</p>
<p>Unusually for a settlement, Pisgat Zeev has attracted a tiny but growing population of Arab families, both from East Jerusalem and from inside Israel. Because Pisgat Zeev sits within Jerusalem&rsquo;s municipal borders, Arabs with Israeli residency rights can live there as long as Jewish settlers are willing to rent to them.</p>
<p>One member, who identified himself as Moshe to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, said: &#8220;Our goal is to be in contact with these girls and try to explain to them the dangers of what they&rsquo;re getting themselves into. In the last 10 years, 60 girls from Pisgat Zeev have gone into [Palestinian] villages [in the West Bank]. And most of them aren&rsquo;t heard from after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He denied that violence or threats were used against Arab men.</p>
<p>Last year, the municipality of Kiryat Gat, a town of 50,000 Jews in southern Israel, launched a programme in schools to warn Jewish girls of the dangers of dating local Bedouin men. The girls were shown a video titled Sleeping with the Enemy, which describes mixed couples as an &#8220;unnatural phenomenon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Haim Shalom, head of the municipality&rsquo;s welfare department, is filmed saying: &#8220;The girls, in their innocence, go with the exploitative Arab.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2004, posters sprang up all over the northern town of Safed warning Jewish women that dating Arab men would lead to &#8220;beatings, hard drugs, prostitution and crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Safed&rsquo;s chief rabbi, Shmuel Eliyahu, told a local newspaper that the &#8220;seducing&#8221; of Jewish girls was &#8220;another form of war&#8221; by Arab men.</p>
<p>Both Kiryat Gat and Safed&rsquo;s campaigns were supported by a religious organisation called Yad L&rsquo;achim, which runs an anti-assimilation team publicly dedicated to &#8220;saving&#8221; Jewish women.</p>
<p>According to its website, the organisation receives more than 100 calls a month about Jewish women living with Arab men, both in Israel and the West Bank. It launches &#8220;military-like rescues [of the women] from hostile Arab villages&#8221; in co-ordination with the police and army.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jewish soul is a precious, all-too-rare resource, and we are not prepared to give up on even a single one,&#8221; says the website.<br>

		<p>First comes the feminist screaming for unequal and biased rights for themselves and other &#8220;minorities&#8221; (of course the feminists are not a minority but&hellip;)at the expence of the patriarchy. Yes Isreal has been under feminist attack for years.</p>
<p>Then the feminist get the State to protect them because the State doesn&rsquo;t expect anything in return like I don&rsquo;t know loyalty and such.</p>
<p>Then the State makes it harder for the &#8220;majority&#8221; men (in this case Jewish but in America it was just White men) to compete in the job market, to defend themselves in anyway, to just be men.</p>
<p>Then the Jewish women (insert White women in the USA) need that thrill of danger so they go for the bad boys since the State has effectively neutered the &#8220;majority&#8221; men they must go for the Muslim men or minority thugs in America. It gives them that bit of danger they crave to date in tabboo-land.</p>
<p>45 years from now a half Jewish but racially Muslim male will become prime minister of Isreal and begin systematically weakening Isreal to honor his Muslim father that his selfish feminist mother mated with because she was bored and needed some excitement.</p>
<p>Hey it&rsquo;s possible. This scenario has happened before&hellip; I think&hellip;<br>

		<p>The biggest proponents of interracial dating and marriage (between whites and non-whites) in the US are radical Jews. And they are not a small minority of the Jewish population. They preach the joys of intermarriage, except when it comes to their own. This is something that should be discussed more openly, in the hopes of getting the &#8220;silent&#8221; majority of Jews who say nothing to put the kibosh on this type of behavior from their very vocal and often powerful brethren, who too often feel as if they are war with other whites while not realizing that the majority of non-whites simply see Jews as &#8220;whites with a lot of money&#8221; whether the Jews in question have money or not. In the long run, this is as bad for the Jews, if not worse, as it is for other whites. </p>

		<p>You have to respect these people.  Many years ago, I dated a Jew from a secular family.  Papa told her to choose me or her family and people, and I lost.  Her father was a decent man who bore me no personal grudge, but he wasn&rsquo;t giving up 3000 years of culture to indulge a foolish daughter.  </p>

		<p>It is obvious that the Jews must be racist. They must have been highly influenced by the pope who recently suggested that Christian women be extremely wary of marrying Muslims. Perhaps it could also be the Hindus, who, in Kerala state have teamed up with Christians to to stop this jihad against non-muslim women. Fortunately it is all one sided, no one in these three faiths objects to one of their own marrying a Muslim women. If more men married Muslim women, I am sure a lot of these false beliefs would vanish from the face of the earth. The only pity is that the Muslim women who do smile at non Muslim men tend to have a very short life expectancy, they keep falling into wells, cutting their throats, shooting themselves in the back of the head or strangling themselves with an extension cord.</p>

<p>The Jewish attitude toward interracial relationships in the USA and the West in general has been aggressively integrationist&hellip;but not for themselves. It&rsquo;s whopping hypocrisy for Jews in America to tell white gentiles to be ashamed of &#8220;racism&#8221; while indulging in their own. The current integrationist multiculturalism is a recipe for cultural disintegration of European culture and the West. This is the hypocrisy of the Culture of Critique. Why don&rsquo;t they critique themselves?   </p>

		<p>Regarding poster #5&rsquo;s experience: I grew up in an area with a substantial Jewish population. It was common for several students to be absent from school on Jewish holidays. No big deal to the rest of us   &mdash;   they had their holidays, we had ours. Everyone got along fine. That continued in high school, but only up to a point. The vast majority of Jewish students   &mdash;   boys and girls alike   &mdash;   were not allowed to date Gentiles, period. A few weren&rsquo;t even allowed to have non-Jewish friends.</p>
<p>Recently the Illinois Supreme Court <a href="http://joi.org/bloglinks/Jewish-disinherit.htm" rel="nofollow">upheld a clause in a Jewish man&rsquo;s will</a> stating his grandchildren would be disinherited if they married outside the faith. With the legal precedent set, racially conscious whites should consider employing the same tactic   &mdash;   marry a nonwhite and you&rsquo;re cut out of the estate.</p>

		<p>Jews are hypocrites, in that they preach multiculturalism in all other nations, so that no one race or ethnicity is dominant; then, on the other hand, they decry interfaith marriage, claiming that it will result in the extinction of the Jewish race.</p>

		<p>I remember years ago knowing a jewish girl who&rsquo;s mother was an upper eastside lib sociologist. Of course the mom was all for race mixing (according to her daughter. I only met the mom once or twice). That was, of course, when daughter was dating another jew in her string quartet. However, when she later took up with some black guy (who was trying to break into the then USFL), mom couldn&rsquo;t take it, which prompted daughter to complain to everybody that her mom was a hypocrite, etc., etc. Actually pretty funny stuff.</p>
<p>Of course her mom was not a hypocrite. she just didn&rsquo;t think race mixing applied to jews.</p>

		<p>Some time back, posted on www.sweetness-light.com was a copy of a U.S. state department warning to young, American college women, mostly White women cautioning them NOT TO MARRY Saudi muslim men. It specified Saudi, but further in it also pointed out and DESCRIBED IN DETAIL!!! the abuse the woman who did marry one would possibly (almost certainly in my experience with those dogs) be subject to, notwithstanding the fact that the children would be raised muslim, with her having no say in the matter. As you might guess, this totally &#8220;outraged&#8221; the Saudis, go look it up, it is a pretty detailed warning.</p>

		<p>Plenty of people with Jewish origins know nothing about the Jewish faith and do not care.  I have certainly seen this among my Christian relatives too.  I am sure that the same goes for Muslims.  I am an ex-Sunday school teacher and choir singer who no longer even attends church. I still think that it is best to stay with someone of your own religious, racial, and perhaps even ethnic background.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it is a good idea to even date someone you would not consider marrying because children have a tendency to show up in longterm relatonships period.  Then the families start having in-law type fights with each other over child support and sometimes who gets the child on which holiday, etc.  It has been my observation that people who do not like their grandchild&rsquo;s other parent will try harder, usually much harder, to accept that person if there is a marriage, so for that reason alone I do not buy the argument that it is &#8220;just a piece of paper.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I think the Jewish parents discouraging their children from marrying someone with very different views of the world are correct to do so.  I really do.  However, I do have a bone to pick with those who say that mixed marriages between non-Jews is different and okay since Jews are not involved.       </p>

		<p>I have something else to say about this while I am thinking about it.</p>
<p>Skip, I have never been to Saudi Arabia, but I have lived in Muslim countries.  My grandparents raised me, and they were diplomats.  I am not a diplomat so I can speak my mind and not care about being diplomatic.  </p>
<p>Kuwait was bearable in spite of the extreme heat, but the rest of the Arab world that I have seen is all like Hell in both senses of the word.  The more Islam has a stronghold on a country, the worst it seems to be.  Of the countries that I have been to, Yemen is the country that is supposedly the most like Saudi Arabia.  Oh, my God, what a terrible place.  Being a man would not change that.  .</p>

Your post reminded me of something my liberal Americanophile parent said to me once after spending several days alone in 1990&rsquo;s Suharto&rsquo;s Indonesia. Who was trying to connect with her US servicemen husband in Singapore who was travelling via the Philippines.<br>
After being in a military controlled environment, surrounded by hostile Muslims, extreme poverty, disease ridden unburied garbage shewn everywhere, &#8216;open&rsquo; toilets and with mostly in editable food and undrinkable water available.<br>
That she could really relate to that scene in the end of the film &#8216;Not without my daughter,&rsquo; when the relieved Michiganian Betty Mahmoody (played by Sally Fields) who after escaping matrimonial imprisonment in Iran finally sees Old Glory flying high at the Turkish US Embassy at which point she says &#8220;We&rsquo;re home, baby.&#8221;<br>
The trip gave her a new short lived appreciation of what freedom and the Western world stand for. </p>

		<p>Just to add, in the &#8216;true life&rsquo; story I mentioned above, apparently the American woman was convinced to travel to Iran by her husband, who himself was a Doctor, who&rsquo;d lived in the States for 20 yrs prior and who swore on the Koran that she would be well treated.<br>
Based on those credentials I think if I was in her situation I may have trusted himself myself.<br>
(Well obviously not at this more skeptical point in my life.) </p>
<p>And on the contentious subject of this thread, I have have never heard an adequate and decisive answer on whether Judaism and/or Islam is a Race or Religion?<br>
I appreciate that officially &#8216;religion&rsquo; is the answer for both, but unofficially I gather it&rsquo;s a bit from column A and Column B, well perhaps in the historical origins at least.<br>
Maybe I&rsquo;ve answered my own question, but if someone could enlighten me further.</p>
<p>If preserving religion is politically OK, then perhaps there&rsquo;s a solution there (he&rsquo;s says very casually.)<br>
Scientology as an example of a &#8216;new religion&rsquo; has been official since 1953 and has a reported 3.5 million members in the US alone.<br>
I suppose there&rsquo;s already options out there.<br>
Personally I enjoy the odd light hearted theological debate, but all that kneeling and praying for forgiveness was never my cup of tea.<br>
So &#8216;you can lead a horse to water&hellip;&rsquo;</p>

		<p>15 White, Jewish, &amp; Proud: You don&rsquo;t have to be a neo-Nazi to recognize that Jews have always played a leading role in all Marxist and anti-White activities in the West.  If you&rsquo;d like a reference, try chapter 5 in Dennis Prager&rsquo;s &#8220;Why the Jews: The Reasons for Anti-Semitism&#8221;.  Is an observant Jew like Prager a neo-Nazi?  <br>
     While Jews are not Caucasians, I am willing to accept them as fellow Whites simply due to our long history together and their many positive contributions to Western culture.  If not family, then they are neighbors of long standing.  Consequently, I have no tolerance for that large number among them who, while enjoying the benefits of American society, actively work to destroy us.  I view such Jews not as alien enemies, nor as &#8220;eternal, demon Jews&#8221;, but as betrayers of our common nation.  When I read someone denying the obvious fact of the Jewish role in the anti-White movement, I think I&rsquo;ve accidentally stumbled onto the SPLC website.  </p>

		<p>Not all Jewish people think along these lines, the majority do not&hellip;however for years the apparatchiks amongst them have encouraged the vast majority (gentile) of humanity to intermarry and sacrifice their unique racial characteristics while upholding and attempting to preserve their own. Their hyopcrisy is blatant and should serve as a warning to their method. The ironic but fitting result of an increasing number Jewish women practicing exogamy should be viewed by these so-called elites as blowback and a logical deterrent to further social engineering. I&rsquo;m not the first to think it, but <i>Reap what you sew,</i> comes to top of my mind after reading this article. Now, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along?</p>

		<p>&#8220;When I read someone denying the obvious fact of the Jewish role in the anti-White movement, I think I&rsquo;ve accidentally stumbled onto the SPLC website.&#8221; Poster #18</p>
<p>And of the Kennedys, the Pelosis, the Catholics, the Methodists, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Mormons, atheists, socilaists/communists   &mdash;   the Gentile involvement without which any anti-White/Westeren policy of any magnitutde would be impsossible we hear nothing.</p>
<p>Why, because we all really know who&rsquo;s behind it all.  Why, of course, it&rsquo;s those pesky Jews again.  Well, Mr or Ms or Mrs Schoolteacher, to focus on Jewish and only Jewish causation and culpability and ascribing it as being a defect of character in Jews is in this issue and every one like it naked anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>There, I&rsquo;ve said it.  Naked anti-Semitism.</p>

		<p>21 Jewamongyou: Ethnically, Jews are Semites, not Caucasians.  If your Georgian ancestors converted to Judaism or married Jewish women, then you are a Jew as well as a Caucasian.  But most Jews are not, though many of them have a Goy in the woodpile.  <br>
     And no need to thank me for counting Jews as White.  The comment was not directed at you.  There are, as you must know, some Euro-Caucasian-Whites who do not regard Jews as fellow Whites.  </p>

<p>Ah, the name calling is getting out of hand. The point isn&rsquo;t whether or not Jews are Caucasians, the point in US is that there are in fact  Jews who privately consider themselves different or non-white and carry on with activities hostile to other whites. Why it is considered some type of insult or crime to mention this fact is beyond me, just as denying this fact is disingenuous to the core. It&rsquo;s ok to mention other whites who work against their own, so it should be ok to mention Jews, like those who comprise the ACLU, the hypocritical ADL and those who are involved in anti-white immigration groups and policies. We can mention lunkheads like Teddy K and the very white yet anti-white Janet Napolitano so we should be free to state Abe Foxman is an incredible anti-white hypocrite. </p>
<p>As mentioned by another poster above, the silent majority of Jews who don&rsquo;t indulge in radical anti-white behavior need to step up and grab the megaphone from their kin whose media control at the moment is one of the main engines driving America into the dirt. Kick &#8216;em out of their offices along with other anti-white whites like Bill Gates. Bill is very smart. Bill isn&rsquo;t Jewish. But Bill&rsquo;s lobbying for the H1B just to pocket a few more coins is just as bad as the actions of the anti-white Hollywood crowd. In the end, why should we worry about any motives ascribed to those engaging in anti-white behavior? We should worry about derailing them, let things be sorted out once normal people have the reins in hand. The non-Jews should not get out of control blaming Jews for everything while the Jews should quit the overblown and silly act of trying to deny Jewish involvement in anything negative. </p>

 Jewamoung you said:  I had to laugh at Schoolteacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;While Jews are not Caucasians, I am willing to accept them as fellow Whites&hellip;&rdquo;    <br>
Oh, thank you kind sir or madam. I am Jewish. I am also descended from Georgian stock, which makes me a heck of a lot more Caucasian than many, if not most, of the readers of AmRen.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>I was slightly amused too, as  (like Carleton Coon) I consider Semites to be within the Caucasian family.  (Anyway, Semites are technically a linguistic group, not racial.)    Certainly, they do not constitute a separate group among the 5 major races of mankind.  No, they&rsquo;re not white Europeans,  but they&rsquo;re still Caucasians nonetheless. Granted, there&rsquo;s a lot of disagreement here on Amren as to who is &#8220;white&#8221;.  Some have much broader definitions than others. </p>
<p>  [<i>&#8220;Coon used the term &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221; and &#8220;White race&#8221; synonymously, as was  common in the United States (although not elsewhere). This is in contrast to many uses of the term &#8220;White race&#8221; that exclude Arabs and those from the Indian subcontinent. Typically Coon would include most people from the Middle East and South Asia within the &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221; and &#8220;White&#8221; definitions&hellip; He considered the European racial type to be a sub-race of the Caucasoid race.&#8221; </i>]</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re absolutely  right   &mdash;    that no one could be more &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; than a Georgian (within a geographical sense, but not racially). </p>
<p>However, and meaning no offense, I do recall at least two occasions when you have stated here that you are not white or do not consider yourself  to be white.  Have you  since undergone a Michael  Jackson transformation?</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a shame that American Rennaisance continues to attract this kind of semi-thinker, who is still posessed with the image of the &ldquo;eternal, demon Jew&rdquo; forever bent on undermining the Gentile world.  When I read these comments, I thought I&rsquo;d accidently stumbled on to Stormfront.&#8221;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>You could do better.  Instead of commenting on their similarity to someplace else (who cares?)  or lamenting about what  &#8220;a shame&#8221; it is that they got printed,  why don&rsquo;t you refute them and show where they are wrong?  Correcting errors and presenting truth would do us all a service.  </p>
<p>PS. I am deeply sympathetic to the awkward situation of those Jews who are embarassed by the  leftist activities and sympathies  of the majority of their co-ethnics and the many organizations  that represent them.  But  silencing uncomfortable discussion is not the way to handle it.<br>

		<p>21 Jewamongyou: I did some online checking of &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; and &#8220;Semitic&#8221;.  The consensus seems to be that Jews are Caucasians, with some references to &#8220;it was formerly thought&hellip;&#8221;  I stand corrected.  Not the way I learned it, but I gather that new genetic proof trumps the older linguistic evidence.  I stand by my other statements.  <br>
    <br>
BTW, I hope it&rsquo;s not been discovered that Georgians are Semites.  Next thing you know, they&rsquo;ll be confiscating my slide rule.  </p>

		<p>I for one am tired of some jews using the &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; canard to stifle honest discussion about various aspects of jewish culture and behavior.<br>
It seems that some jews take the same position as blacks do on ways to stifle honest discussion.  Blacks call people &#8220;racist&#8221; when they cannot prevail in an argument that they disagree with.<br>
However, I am sure that most jews have the same quest for TRUTH that most of us have.</p>

		<p>A question to Jewish people who support White issues would be &#8220;do you consider yourself White first or Jewish first&#8221;?</p>
<p>And if Judaism is a religion only, then &#8216;anti-Semitism&rsquo; is not a racial term but one of religious intolerance only?</p>
<p>Being interested in White specific affairs, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that a lot of pro-White people blame the Jewish people for various things and I&rsquo;ve read about the Rothschild&rsquo;s, Gulags, ADL and all of that stuff but I&rsquo;ve never been convinced or have found the &#8216;smoking gun&rsquo; that ties everyone together as being a unified effort against White per se.<br>
The closet thing I&rsquo;ve seen to an evil cabal myself would be the global private equity investment firm &#8216;The Carlye group.&rsquo;<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group#Political_figures" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group#Political_figures</a><br>
But it can be stated that as a group, Jewish people have been cornerstone members of various anti-White institutions such as the NAACP and their influence in Global banking and the Media can not be over stated.<br>
Both of my grandfathers came back from WW2 having served a minimum of four years each in front line units and I know that they both have the blood of German soldiers on their hands.<br>
My SH grandfather found the photo of the sweetheart back home in the pocket of a dead German(really happened, I&rsquo;m not confusing Hollywood with family memories)and that deeply affected him aparentally.<br>
But yet I as their descendant know that if I mention anything about Nazi era Germany such as my interest in their green energy programs, their iconlogy or gasp at the organization involved at their 1937 Nuremberg rally. I know that I run the risk of being thrown in the same boat as those goose steppers myself.<br>
Jewish Whites do have the luxury of having their feet in two camps, if pressed too hard you can always fall back on your minority status.<br>
As Mike Wallace says in this interview <br>
&#8220;I&rsquo;m not White I&rsquo;m Jewish.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO214IFRW1M" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO214IFRW1M</a><br>
I envy your position, but do not like the fact that the only way to enjoy the same exempt status is by becoming a minority or victim of some sort myself.</p>

		<p>The point that Amren is trying to make by posting this story - I believe - is that many people of the world practice anti-miscegenation as a normal part of their culture. And if that were the case, why can&rsquo;t White Americans. If there are marriage laws in some countries that make it impossible for mixed couples to wed, why not allow states to bring back anti-miscegenation laws that were forcefully repealed. If other countries practice segregation without outcry from the world community, so too there ought to be no criticism if practiced by Americans of any color.</p>
<p>In context of those self evident truths, I would address allegations of &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; in this discussion. Simply, I do not believe that was ever Amren&rsquo;s intent to promote it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there has been considerable sensitivity and defensiveness at mentioning the slightest possibility that Jews may have been involved with making fashionable miscegenation (along with liberalism) however proportional it may be compared to Gentile involvement. It is as if our Jewish members, at least some, hysterically shout &#8220;anti-Semitism!&#8221; in the same way Blacks and liberal Whites use &#8220;racism!&#8221; whenever it&rsquo;s convenient (or only way left) to silence the opposition.</p>
<p>But to censor free speech and open discussion about any topic under the guise of curbing &#8220;hate&#8221; would serve no purpose other than wilful promotion of ignorance. It&rsquo;s like suppressing facts about racial differences in IQ for all the inconvenient social implications that has.</p>
<p>If Jews were/are involved in promoting inter-marriage for non-Jews, let&rsquo;s be open about whether that is and if so to what degree and why. Is there something to fear about revealing the full truth? Ignorance or half truths are far worse. Let&rsquo;s examine all facts without fear of what they will reveal for understanding the truth about racial differences and liberalism is the start of reform in our troubled times.</p>

		<p>29  &mdash;  Reality Check<br>
Thank you for adding that clarification.<br>
This thread has been playing on my mind all week.<br>
I &#8216;barged in&rsquo; to this conversation and after rereading the comments prior to my reactionary comment 28, which I realize was also a &#8216;Johnnie come lately&rsquo; and was somewhat redundant.<br>
Though in the context of the conversation I feel I had a valid point, albeit repetitive, but standing alone I probably came off as resentful and hostile. For any offense caused to any regulars I sincerely apologize and I didn&rsquo;t mean to &#8216;preach to the converted,&rsquo; but then I think nerves may have been touched on both sides.<br>
When being proud of your own group and then comparing your groups progress to others, I sometimes forget to not judge others as individuals and not merely as members of their larger group. Which is not fair when you as the individual have no power or control over your larger group.<br>
But then I also believe that there is some truths in stereotypes i.e. My Irish grand father died of serosis of the liver and my Scottish descended mother can be cheap.<br>
Personally I have no problem with any group defending or promoting their own self interests (it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here) and of course the Jewish people have many valid reasons to feel they need to do that.<br>
I think I may be jealous of how effective they are at it, as for 3% of your population they have so much power and influence, but in saying that I&rsquo;ve never meet a successful Jewish person who was not a workaholic (their kids is another story and probably the reason for groups such as this one in the article.) <br>
I think also a lot of Jewish inspired altruism has maybe been seen as anti White (male specifically) because when working positively for others it comes across as a negative for us.<br>
But I see that Jewish inspired altruism was not a Marxist plot to dethrone us males as to carve a path for themselves, but was really a sincere gesture to help others.<br>
And on that note I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that I think liberalism may be a more advanced political ideology than (well my) conservatism, as my conservatism comes from a primal place in that I want to see my bloodline live on forever, in the same way that I look just like my great grandfather. I appreciate that doesn&rsquo;t sound very spiritual being ever concerned with my earth bound &#8216;flesh&rsquo; and there is a little narcissism in it. <br>
But such as this (no doubt marginalized) Jewish group recognizes a connection between the flesh and the spiritual (they&rsquo;d would have to say &#8216;cultural&rsquo;), in the same way there&rsquo;s a connection between Whites and our civilization. <br>
Such as with the Nature V Nurture argument, it&rsquo;s obviously not going to be 100% to 0% either way you look at it, there is some truth on both sides.<br>
But back to thinking liberalism is possibly a more advanced ideology, maybe it is, but it&rsquo;s just not practical in this world the way it is. Who could have guessed that the World&rsquo;s pop was going to go from 1 billion to 6 billion in a 100 yrs? Do you know how much pressure it puts on us all? We have this situation where we need international welfare to not only sustain but to encourage further growth, while in comparison due to the ever changing ratio&rsquo;s between the rich and poor countries we start to look greedier and greedier while maintaining only slight growth ourselves (from non-White participation.) <br>
And then World wide socialism will become be a requirement, just to redistribute wealth to those who have none probably out of necessity.<br>
Sorry I&rsquo;m digressing.<br>
The Utopian vision, nice ideal but wrong planet and wrong time.<br>
Maybe if we had 500,000 people not six billion. We have too many people and we need to discourage further growth not encourage (or enable) and that goes against what every one of us was, well taught.<br>
From following &#8216;White,Jewish and Proud&rsquo;s&rsquo; comments over the years I can tell that you have an innate sense of justice inside of you and you want to help fix the imbalances in this world, and God bless you for it.<br>
And this is coming from someone who family is Roman Catholic on both sides(non practicing), though I make blond babies us Catholics have only been allowed to represent pro-White values ourselves since the 1960&rsquo;s. And trust me when I say I personally had nothing to do with the &#8216;no condoms in Africa&rsquo; standpoint or the &#8216;no abortions for incest rape victims in South America&rsquo; stance either. So I am sorry if it sounded like I was painting you with the same Jewish brush. <br>
But at the same time we can all openly discuss the flaws of the Catholic church without being accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; or it&rsquo;s equivalent and maybe this is where I was confused prior to this conversation. I still am a little bit confused on the Race/religion aspect, but I&rsquo;ve learned somethings from this thread for sure.<br>
Sometimes when you look at the mess the World is in you just want to find someone to blame and yours is a very capable and vocal people. <br>
But both fault and resurgence have to found within before we can move on forward, hopefully together in our united self interest.<br>
And we need more Jewish support along with more White liberals to &#8216;convert&rsquo; and to stop perceiving us as haters and then maybe the donations that go the SPLC will start coming here instead. <br>
I hope all that makes sense somehow and helps explain my point of view.</p>
