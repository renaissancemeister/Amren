<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091022/US.Ski.Flap/">Navajos May Try to Buy Popular Arizona Ski Resort</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Felicia Fonseca, Comcast News, October 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Navajo Nation may try to buy a popular Arizona ski resort to stop snowmaking on one of the tribe&rsquo;s most sacred mountains, the San Francisco Peaks.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation Council voted Wednesday to consider legislation that would allow the tribe to secure an appraisal and negotiate with the partners who own the Arizona Snowbowl outside Flagstaff.</p>
<p>The Navajo and several other tribes fought in court for several years to stop the Snowbowl&rsquo;s plan to use reclaimed wastewater to make snow. Tribes have said the practice would desecrate the land they hold sacred and infringe on their religious beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court turned down the tribes&rsquo; final appeal in June, and the resort&rsquo;s owners plan to begin adding the snowmaking equipment next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The council could take a final vote on the legislation later this week during its fall session.</p>
<p>The Arizona Snowbowl Limited Partnership purchased the ski resort in 1992 for $4 million. Owner Eric Borowsky said late Wednesday that it is not for sale. But he said he has an obligation as a general partner to submit any valid offers to the limited partners for a vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maxx&rsquo;s bill doesn&rsquo;t include a price the tribe would be willing to pay for the Snowbowl. If a purchase is ultimately made, the money likely would come from the tribe&rsquo;s Land Acquisition Fund, said Delegate Jonathan Nez, who sits on the council&rsquo;s Budget and Finance Committee.</p>
<p>The fund was developed to consolidate the checkerboard of Indian and non-Indian land around the reservation. Tribal officials used it to finance the development of the Navajo Nation&rsquo;s first casino just outside Gallup, N.M.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Snowbowl officials have said the snowmaking equipment is necessary to ensure the survival of the ski area, which opened in 1937 and has struggled with short seasons because of a lack of snow. The ski resort plans to add a fifth chair lift, spray man-made snow and clear about 100 acres of forest to extend its ski season.</p>

		<p>I would be supportive of their claim if;</p>
<p>1. They could prove scientifically that their ancestors are bothered.</p>
<p>2. Whites could claim land as sacred in Europe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They claim artificial snowmaking disturbs their ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course one of their slot machines ringing away on a jackpot win doesn&rsquo;t bother them at all.</p>
<p>Amazing how that works, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really have a problem with the Indians&rsquo; actions, other than their lawsuit (although I can think of plenty of stupider lawsuits).  If a company turned Bethlehem into a resort, plenty of Christians would (rightly) complain.</p>

		<p>If the Navajo buy the resort with their own money they have the right to do what they want with it, including shutting it down.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see the problem here. We may not agree with their beliefs, but since they are trying to buy the resort (and not take it by suing the owners), I&rsquo;m actually quite supportive.</p>

		<p>When Coronado first entered into the American southwest, he found NO Navajo and NO Apache. Those tribes ONLY entered into the area about fifty to one hundred years after Coronado.</p>
<p>You could reasonably suggest that the land around Flagstaff is no more the ancestral land of the Navajo than it would have been for Coronado, a Spaniard!</p>

		<p>#6 is absolutely correct.  The athapaskans (navajo and apache) probably arrived in the southwest at about the same time as the spanish.  The navajo quickly adopted some of the religious beliefs of the indigenous puebloan people like the hopi who were already in the area.  Thus the &#8216;sacredness&rsquo; of the san francisco peaks to the navajo is only about 400 yrs old.</p>

		<p>I am a white American patriot, so I am very usually suspect about all miniority claims, and thinks that the stronger white America is and weaker black America and Hispanic America is, we are stronger.  However, I know #6 is wrong as the Navajos have been in the Southwest for thousands of years and they battled the Hopi, and the ancient Anasazi.  I also think that Native Americans are actually, except for the drinking Indians, are allies in our fight against the elites as they are totally assimilated Americans, especially tribes like the Cherokees, which was assimilated in the early 1800&rsquo;s, and I have  1/16 Cherokee myself, and proud of it as they have fought on the borders and been productive Americans.</p>

		<p>Excuse my prejudice, but ski resorts and golf courses tend to be full of people who don&rsquo;t especially care about the White race, especially those Whites who actually get dirt on their hands at work.  Legality aside, I&rsquo;m for the Navaho here.  </p>
