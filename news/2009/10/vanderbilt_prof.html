<h1>Vanderbilt Professor Slammed for Backing Film That Calls Racism a Myth</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janell Ross, The Tennessean (Nashville), October 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An organization that tracks hate-group activity in the U.S. is accusing Vanderbilt University professor Carol Swain (https://www.carolmswain.com/), a black scholar known for her conservative stances on race and immigration, of being an apologist for white supremacists.</p>
<p>The incident started last week when the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center posted a blog item critiquing the documentary A Conversation About Race, mentioning that positive comments by Swain lent the film an air of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Swain fired back, making her case against the advocacy group in a blog submitted to the news site The Huffington Post and in a string of messages she sent to followers on her Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&rsquo;t enough new hate groups 2 keep the SPLC busy, so they target individuals &amp; conservative organizations 2 raise money,&#8221; Swain wrote in a Twitter update Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Swain defends praise</b></p>
<p>Swain is quoted as saying the film is, &#8220;Outstanding .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meticulously done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I highly recommend this film.&#8221; Bodeker lists the blurb as the first one on the film&rsquo;s Web site.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is her review valuable? Why is it important? Because she is an African-American woman,&#8221; Bodeker said in an interview. &#8220;A member of the Vanderbilt University faculty and the National Council on Humanities and she has a Ph.D.  &mdash;  you better believe I put her quote on the DVD box, on the poster. That&rsquo;s how this is done. You try to attract attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>For her part, Swain contends that the documentary is a valuable tool that could be used in classrooms to initiate a conversation on race that includes the perspective of what may be a growing number of white people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just think that if we do not discuss these things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are creating the conditions for ethnic violence and unrest,&#8221; Swain said.</p>
<p>But <a href="&rdquo;/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.php#splc&rdquo;" target="&rdquo;splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy" [mark] potock< a> said the film&rsquo;s premise, that racism is a myth, is ridiculous in a country that practiced chattel slavery for 200 years and allowed Jim Crow laws to stand for 100 years thereafter. The idea that white people are oppressed by conversations about racism or allegations of racism is insidious, Potock said.</p>
<p>Swain&rsquo;s endorsement of such ideas, he said, is shocking. &#8220;What it made clear is that Carol Swain is an apologist for white supremacists,&#8221; said Potock, adding that her endorsement represents a kind of cover that can funnel extremist ideas into reputable publications and ordinary people&rsquo;s conversations.</p>
<p>Swain sees things differently. If there are going to be conversations about race, she thinks they have to include what the Southern Poverty Law Center may consider extremist or hateful positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new white nationalism that I fear that I see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is not about groups,&#8221; Swain said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about white people, individuals, thinking that they are under threat and that they have to ban together to protect themselves. My fear is that unless we create forums for people to safely and openly express themselves, then you are going to drive more young people into these extreme groups.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Heaven forbid that whites would band together.  We can&rsquo;t have that.  <br>
However, whites with sanity do band together.  We&rsquo;re called family and friends and you had better not tread on us.  We&rsquo;re about up to here with it. (hand at neck level)</p>

		<p>Swain is wrong. There are plenty of hate groups spreading anti White racism and bigotry, enough to keep SPLC padding its bank accounts far into the future. The problem is getting SPLC to address those hate groups.</p>

<p>I fully expect the SPLC to have cash flow problems within the next year as the economy worsens.  Best case scenario is if they went bankrupt by 2011.</p>

		<p>Well, she&rsquo;s exactly right.  There are a number of us who think precisely that.  We ARE banding together to protect ourselves.  People have done that since cave man days - is it really so strange?  As for whites being threatened, well, all you have to do is try and drive-while-white in SoCentral LA - you&rsquo;ll find all the threats you can handle, and you may end up dead for it.</p>

<p>That pretty much hits the nail on the head Dr. Swain!</p>
<p>The SPLC should start investigating themselves, since they openly support hate in the forms of genocidal miscegenation and multiculturalism. Anyone and everyone that is not enraptured with these flagrantly animalistic fetishes, is targeted by the likes of this freak Potock and his SPLComrades, and is summarily subjected to abuse and slander.</p>
<p>She ought to sue them for everything that they have!<br>

		<p>Carol Swain is actually being too kind to the SPLC.  </p>
<p>It is not that the SPLC ran out of hate groups so they now target conservative groups;  no, their war with conservative groups is at the root of who they are and who they have always been.  </p>

		<p>The reason why free speech exists in the first place is to protect unpopular speech. Free speech does not exist to protect popular speech, because speech that everyone agrees with doesn&rsquo;t need protection in the first place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a black American commending this video. In doing so, she is supporting free speech because the content in the video could be considered unpopular and somewhat controversial.</p>
<p>But the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization notorious for its witch-hunting tactics, shows a blatant animus for unpopular and controversial speech; therefore, they show hatred and enmity for free speech.</p>
<p>These free speech-hating liberals can&rsquo;t stand contrarian viewpoints. Just look at the nonsense coming from this idiot&rsquo;s mouth: &#8220;&#8216;What it made clear is that Carol Swain is an apologist for white supremacists,&rsquo; said Potock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Potock did not argue against the actual content in the video, which is something that a teenager with rudimentary knowledge of debating skills would be capable of doing. But proving himself incapable of the ability to debate others who have a different perspective on things he disagrees with, he attributed it to white supremacy. When someone uses an insult in place of an arguement, it&rsquo;s called an <i> ad hominem attack. </i></p>
<p>Although I haven&rsquo;t seen <i> A Conversation About Race, </i> I&rsquo;ve seen a few sample clips on the Internet. The content I viewed was rational and objective; it did not incite hatred or violence towards minorities. Which leads me to believe that the Southern Poverty Law Center isn&rsquo;t calling it extremist and hateful because of its content; they&rsquo;re calling it extremist and hateful simply because they disagree with it.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center has been abusing it&rsquo;s power to silence free speech. Recently, I read an old article on vdare.com written by a journalist who worked for a purported &#8220;conservative&#8221; newspaper; he lost his job because a leader of the SPLC, Heidi Beirich, an obviously overweight woman who needs to hit the gym, called his boss to tell him that he was an editor of a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; magazine called the Occidental Quarterly. He was fired within the hour because this evil woman, who will apparently try to ruin someone&rsquo;s life for merely disagreeing with them, didn&rsquo;t like his views.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about time the Southern Poverty Law Center lost its non-profit status and quit receiving funds from tax-payers.</p>

		<p>If you aren&rsquo;t enthusiastic enough about discrimination against whites in the form of affirmative action, you&rsquo;re a white supremacist, according to these people. And according to the nations universities and the media too. No wonder they are so successful in basically discriminating against, legislating against, and hating whites.</p>

		<p>At last a kindred spirit. I`ve been screaming for years that racism is an empty word that means nothing.If you say it means hating entire groups of people that is impossible. You can not hate those you don`t know. You can only hate people you know. We all knew that keeping folks from voting was an abomination. Southern whites with money and power played white trash  off against broke blacks. What we didn`t know were what the effects of treating blacks like stupid children. We didn`t know that withing 30 years we would ruin two generations and were closing in on a third. Racism isn`t what has turned decent black folks into single parent thug creation factories. It was democratic pandering and republican neglect.<br>

		<p>My operating assumption to date has been that the last thing the authorities want is for free and open discussion about race and the demographic demise of whites. I&rsquo;ve discussed these issues with hundreds of whites as part of my missionary hobby and I am always struck by how incoherent, fearful, illogical, and ill-informed whites are. Once in a while I am able to make a breakthrough with someone who is surprised that a defence of whites can be made with clear and logical wording. So I have to agree with the SPLC. The modern white movement will greatly benefit from more exposure to open debate. </p>

		<p><i>Vanderbilt University professor Carol Swain (https://www.carolmswain.com/), a black scholar known for her conservative stances on race and immigration, of being an apologist for white supremacists.</i></p>
<p>It is inaccurate to call Carol Swain an apologist for White supremacists.  She did coauthor the book &#8220;Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism&#8221; with Russ Nieli in which various &#8220;White nationalists&#8221; are interviewed and allowed to speak their minds.  The book has what must be a record long introduction (about 80 pages) in which the authors elaborate at great length on how their views differ from those of the people interviewed.  The interviewees range from perfectly decent people like Jared Taylor and Michael Levin to outright neo-Nazis.  What no doubt outrages  the SPLC is that in that book she *does* let various pro-white people speak for themselves, without inserting smears and innuendos every other sentence, as the SPLC would do.  In short, she is what an academic is supposed to be, objective.</p>
<p>And yes, she does believe we should reduce immigration and enforce immigration law, as do the majority of black Americans.  On that issue the &#8220;black leadership&#8221; betrays its constituency just as surely as the &#8220;white leadership&#8221; does.<br>

		<p>Unfortunately, reasonable and practical blacks such as Swain who are willing to tolerate viewpoints that don&rsquo;t conform to a radical black perspective are very view. As white nationalists and survivalists, we will never be able to advance our agenda so long as we fear the disapproval of the SPLC and other anti-racists. I say we begin to unashamedly fight for our interests and make that airhead Tim Wise&rsquo;s worst nightmare come to fruition!</p>

<p>Some left wing anti-white bigot in a local community will send an anonymous tip to the so-called anti-hate group about some local politician in a community. The tip may not be true. The so called anti-hate group will print the tip. </p>
<p>Then, the very person who sent in the false anonymous tip will quote the so-called anti-hate group as the authority to smear the local politician.</p>

		<p>there probably are some genuine racists in the United States, but most white people wish blacks and Hispanics well, and have for a long time now tolerated high crime rates and paid for expensive programs designed to improve their characters and cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>the reason why people are running out of patience is because none of these programs seem to work.</p>
<p>when whites were 85% of the population, black and Hispanic crime and incompetence wasn&rsquo;t affordable if unpleasant problem.</p>
<p>now that whites are being reduced to minority status in the United States, the issue of black and Hispanic crime and incompetence is taking center stage.</p>
<p>I spent 40 years believing that there were no important differences between the races and stridently condemning anyone who thought differently.</p>
<p>I know how to talk to race deniers because I was one of them until recently.</p>
<p>it is not enough to defend whites against charges of racism.</p>
<p>we have to acknowledge racial difference as a reality and deal with it, returning to certain stereotypes, i.e. blacks as less intelligent than whites.</p>
<p>I genuinely wish blacks and Hispanics well, but my top priority is the survival of European civilization, a white majority in the United States, uniform standards in hiring and education, in protecting the environment as of Europe and the Americans for future generations, even if this means a temporary moratorium on immigration and canceling social programs that encourage high birth rates among the less mentally endowed of all races.</p>

		<p>The problem with Whites is our sense of fairness, right and nobles oblige (if I spelled it correctly).  Every other race cares about their group and THEIR needs and doesn&rsquo;t give a care in hell about what is right or fair.  We are giving away our country out of a sense of guilt and letting ourselves be displaced out of the same sense of guilt that has been artificially imposed upon us by groups like the SPLC.  This is one of the reasons why we&rsquo;re being destroyed.</p>

<p>Interesting to note that historically pre-Christian civilizations like Greece and Rome persecuted non-believers of the state relgions.  That is why for example, Socrates was forced to drink poison and other free-thought philosophers had to flee Greece.  One can trace the persecution of free-thought as an uninterrupted line right up to the present.  The decorations and temporal politics change, but the human tendancy, the desire for a state to rule individual thought, is as old as history itself.  We tried to break this trend with the founding of this nation, but we have largely failed.  But if you think you are living under Marxism, you are badly misinformed.  You are only living with a political trend that has Marxist tones in it and a society that is attempting to form a new state &#8220;religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that we ought not to resist it, but our resistance is futile if we don&rsquo;t really understand the full identity of what we are resisting.</p>

		<p>The trick to turning the tide of political correctness is massive reeducation with incremental changes to being labeled a racist. If the impact of being labeled such is reduced to inconsequential, whites would feel less oppressed by minorities (Itself a farce). </p>
<p>The key is marketing the changes. Rush, Beck and O&rsquo;Reilly are seeds of this effort, though most associate them purely as &#8220;bigots&#8221;. These three create resistance, though it needs to be more open.</p>
<p>Being anti-racist has itself become a religion. Everyone congragates around their relation to this standard. The standard should be the bible, not whether or not on is racist. The secularists have pushed this to the max. Its almost unspoken that if you are perceived as a racist, you are hated by God and all people. This needs to be challeneged with true, non-secular Christianity.</p>
<p>Folks, we need to do a little social engineering ourselves.</p>

		<p>WOW amazing * I saw the excerpt #7 posted&hellip;Someone dares to look the sacred cow in the mouth and discover cavities! Its about Time! I&rsquo;m the last person that takes any pleasure at all in pointing out any persons limmitations but roses have thorns for a reason and the white race does need to defend itself as individuals and more importantly as a gene based culture. Some cool veracity has become necessary. What self respect can a group have if it does not defend its interests? What respect would others have of such a group? We do count and have our virtues like all other groups as well we have the right to profit by them. Just what is American about the SPLC?</p>

		<p>Racism is a term so blatantly misused and overused it no longer has any real meaning. Call me a &#8220;racist&#8221; and I&rsquo;ll gladly accept that term. Because any time you disagree with someone on any issue, all you need to is toss the terms &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221; into the conversation to &#8220;prove&#8221; your own point.</p>
