<h1>Genes Drive Behaviour, But Culture Can Select Genes: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marlowe Hood, AFP, October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Culture, not just genes, can drive evolutionary outcomes, according to a study released Wednesday that compares individualist and group-oriented societies across the globe.</p>
<p>Bridging a rarely-crossed border between natural and social sciences, the study looks at the interplay across 29 countries of two sets of data, one genetic and the other cultural.</p>
<p>The researchers found that most people in countries widely described as collectivist have a specific mutation within a gene regulating the transport of serotonin, a neurochemical known to profoundly affect mood.</p>
<p>In China and other east Asian nations, for example, up to 80 percent of the population carry this so-called &#8220;short&#8221; allele, or variant, of a stretch of DNA known as 5-HTTLPR.</p>
<p>Earlier research has shown the S allele to be strongly linked with a range of negative emotions, including anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Critically, it is also associated with the impulse to stay out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>By contrast, in countries of European origin that prize self-expression and the pursuit of individual over group goals, the long or &#8220;L&#8221; allele dominates, with only 40 percent of people carrying the &#8220;S&#8221; variant.</p>
<p>The study, published in Britain&rsquo;s Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, offers a novel explanation as to how this divergence might have come about.</p>
<p>Setting aside discredited ideas linking genetics and race, the researchers suggest that culture and genes may have interacted over time to shape the process of natural selection, helping individuals  &mdash;  and the societies in which they lived  &mdash;  to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Ancient cultures in Asia, Africa and Latin America highly exposed to deadly pathogens, they conjecture, may have tended toward collectivist norms in order to better combat disease.</p>
<p>That social transformation, in turn, could have favoured the gradual dominance of the risk-avoidance S allele.</p>
<p>&#8220;We demonstrate that evolution is operating at least two levels,&#8221; said Joan Chiao, a professor at Northwestern University in Chicago and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is biological, which is well understood. But there is also a level where cultural traits may have been selected for themselves, emerging in congruence with the selection of different types of genes,&#8221; she explained by phone.</p>
<p>One well known example of so-called &#8220;culture-gene co-evolutionary theory&#8221; has to do with drinking cow&rsquo;s milk, something humans are not intrinsically adapted to do.</p>
<p>Over time, milk consumption led to both the genetic selection of protein genes in cattle, and a gene in humans that encodes lactase, an enzyme that can break down the otherwise indigestible lactose in dairy.</p>
<p>In the case of collective cultures and the S allele, &#8220;we don&rsquo;t make a strong claim on the chicken-or-egg problem&#8221; of which came first, said Chiao.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are proposing is that cultural and genetic selection actually operate in tandem, and that you can view human behaviour as a product of culture-gene co-evolution,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study also argues that collectivist cultures may help protect against the genetic risk of depression that comes with having the S allele.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such support seems to buffer vulnerable individuals from the environmental risks or stressors that serve as triggers to depressive episodes,&#8221; said Chiao. The fact that the United States and Europe have higher rates of anxiety and mood disorders despite having the L allele may come from the stress of living in highly individualistic cultures, she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have treated natural selection as a rationale for looking for universal traits, across populations and species.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what really matters is the diversity across populations and species which may help us better understand how natural selection has operated at both individual levels and ecosystem levels,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Here is a perfect example of the ridiculous and disingenuous distortions and lies that we all must make whenever we talk about race.  The authors say, &#8220;Setting aside discredited ideas linking genetics and race . .&#8221;  But the entire article is about linking genetics and race   &mdash;   i.e., they showed that one race primarily has the short gene and another race primarily has the long gene, and that genetic difference may correlate with or even be responsible for major behavioral differences between those races. </p>
<p>We are truly living in an Orwellian world where up is down and down is up.   </p>

<p>&#8220;Culture, not just genes, can drive evolutionary outcomes, according to a study released Wednesday that compares individualist and group-oriented societies across the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>- - Reading this is almost laughable, not because it&rsquo;s not true - it may very well be true, but read this quote from the end of the article - -</p>
<p>&#8220;But what really matters is the diversity across populations and species which may help us better understand how natural selection has operated at both individual levels and ecosystem levels&#8221;</p>
<p>- - Notice that perpetual word - DIVERSITY, that everyone and his grandmother is using today so extensively. &#8220;What really matter is the DIVERSITY &hellip;&#8221;  The writer herself is proving her own point.  She is so affected by this Diversity con game that the people who have an agenda where we&rsquo;re concerned are playing on us that she has given &#8220;Diversity&#8221; the most important role.  What I suspect she&rsquo;s trying to do is cleverly getting us to believe in DIVERSITY.</p>
<p>- - And we know where DIVERSITY is leading us.</p>

<p>So scientists have found that a difference in genes explains the oft-noticed observation that whites are more individualistic than the more conformist Asians- yet they reject their own findings because it&rsquo;s polically incorrect to believe in genetic racial differences!  </p>
<p>The evidence is staring them right in the face but they ignore it because it goes against their secular religion called multiculturalism.</p>

</i><p>&#8220;Selected&#8221; how?  Consciously?  You mean some East Asian patriarchs ca. 20,000 BC sat down in a pow-wow and decided, &#8220;We&rsquo;re in a dangerous environment. From now on, our culture has to be more risk-averse&#8221; and that &#8220;cultural&#8221; decision was some kind of &#8220;co-factor&#8221; in evolution of this S-allele?  There&rsquo;s no evidence for such a ridiculous scenario.<p>But the alternative is no less preposterous: that environmental adaptive imperatives &#8220;selected&#8221; for distinctive &#8220;cultures&#8221; (&#8220;collectivist&#8221; vs. &#8220;individualist&#8221;)as much as for genes.  This is completely circular, unscientific and politically motivated reasoning - a silly attempt to &#8220;de-link&#8221; documented differing behavioral traits of races from both genetics and evolutionary theory, and yet another violation of Occam&rsquo;s Razor in the service of political correctness and contemporary race denial hysteria.  </p></p></p>

<p>Maybe the depression is triggered when those of us with the &ldquo;L&rdquo; allele are subject to repression by those with the &#8220;S&#8221; allele.  Repression from laws, taxes, regulations, forced multiculturalism  from the collectivist with the &#8220;S&#8221; allele that suppresses are natural individual tendencies. </p>

		<p>interesting but hardly new:</p>
<p>it has long been obvious that a culture can select for aggression, intelligence, conformity, artistic talent, athletic prowess, etc.</p>
<p>Those carrying the preferred trait (and corresponding gene) will have better reproductive chances, and the gene corresponding to the prefered trait will gradally come to predominate. </p>
<p>All perfectly commensensical, perfectly simple, and perfectly obvious to anyone with a minimal grasp of the principle of natural selection and its interaction with culture.</p>
<p>Also perfectly obvious to anyone who has ever bred flowers, dogs, pigeons, etc. </p>
<p>Only the blanket denial of Darwinism from the right (Creationism) and the left (denial of racial difference) kept something so stunningly obvious from being the conventional wisdom for so long.</p>

		<p>I teach this thesis since 1970-s.<br>
Here is how you can understand and interpret it.<br>
=============<br>
I will use a computer model. Say we have two twin brothers with the identical - a state of art - CPUs as their brains. The brothers were separated at birth and brought up in families with different culture. In a family of teachers and in a family of thieves. The first one has a high possibility to become a famous scientist, while the other - to become a famous criminal. This is about the culture part.<br>
=============<br>
What about the genetic part. As it has been proven scientifically, Nature supplies races have CPUs with different - high and low - qualities. Two brothers with law performance CPUs (African race)brought up under the mentioned above circumstances have only two options: to become a petty thief or a petty laborer.<br>
About brothers with the state of art CPUs (European race) see the first paragraph above.<br>
===============<br>
So there is no way one can exclude race from the equation.<br>

<p>With most articles here I can read through them and get a coherent consistent message. But so often with articles dealing with genetics and race I find myself getting to the end and saying to myself &#8220;huh?&#8221;. It&rsquo;s as if the writer to protect his hide has to put in a disclaimer even if it contradicts the rest of the article. Maybe this is a skill that journalists have to develop in order to survive.</p>

		<p>8 Elitist is on the mark.  Somewhere between natural selection of wild animals and selective breeding of the domesticated, lies &#8220;cultural selection&#8221;.  Any trait that promotes breeding success, in any creature, will be passed along to the next generation.  If a culture values certain traits and not others, those people with the valued traits will be sexually favored, and pass those traits along to their many offspring.  <br>
     Our &#8220;society&#8221; is so perverted that it actively supports the breeding of those with undesirable traits, and discourages breeding among its best people.  The future population of America is being culturally selected too.  </p>

		<p>Reading the convoluted illogical explanation *Marlowe* Hood&rsquo;s article of her *Joan* Chiao interview reminds of many discussions I had with my ex-wife.  Are we suppose to be reading their minds &hellip;</p>
<p>This research may be the scientific explanation as why IQ is not the most important things.  Now we may have a physical attribute, that can be measured, which explains why Mongoloids with their higher average IQs are less creative then Caucasians.</p>
<p>Multicultist talk about protecting cultures, so if there is indeed a so-called &ldquo;culture-gene co-evolutionary theory&rdquo;, the Multicultist will not want to soil unique cultures with foreign genes. </p>
<p>But the so-called &ldquo;culture-gene co-evolutionary theory&rdquo; of human evolution is about a profound as astronomer announcing that his search has led him to a &ldquo;planet-sun co-development theory&rdquo; of solar system creation.  Sure, it may be true that every sun has planets, but surely there can be no denying which on is the driving force between the two entities in the evolution of a solar system.<br>

Unless Europeans really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for them and have &#8220;co-evolved&#8221; a &#8220;culture&#8221; that produced civilizational achievements yet left them feeling miserable all the time, Chiao&rsquo;s &#8220;culture&#8221; theory explains nothing about human evolution, and particularly the evolution of human behavioral traits, that can&rsquo;t already be explained by the action of genes in a given environment, including the environment&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;culture.&#8221;  Making &#8220;culture&#8221; a co-factor with genes in evolution is therefore a transparently political concession, not a true scientific hypothesis.</p></p></p></p>

<p>I love it how liberal writers toss off nonsense like, &#8220;[the] discredited ideas linking genetics and race.&#8221;  What has been discredited?  Last I checked two black people will have a child who is black, no matter what culture they&rsquo;re in.  It sure looks genetic to me.  Saying that culture and genes interact is neither new nor profound.  Genes create phenotypes, phenotypes create cultures, how well phenotypes succeed in reproducing within the culture they are embedded in determines the future gene frequency.  This is natural selection 101.  What here discredits ideas linking genetics and race?  Especially when this article points out that a gene responsible for some aspects of behavior has different frequencies in different races.  That sounds like a good topic for an Amren conference talk.<br>

		<p>This is scary because our culture in this Country (USA) is not European but is African American. Andrew Sullivan recently was trashing a Pat Buchanan article and said that white Americans are blacker than they think, and of course they are, they are acting more and more black. I hear adult white men and women often saying things like &#8220;dis&#8221; &#8220;dat&#8221; etc. and generally being African in many other ways.</p>

		<p>I believe it&rsquo;s a two-way street, but culture is more affected by genes than vice versa. A culture that is surrounded by warring cultures will need to breed bigger, stronger warriors. A high-tech culture will move toward brains instead of brawn. Hunters will be leaner and have longer legs than farmers. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a tribe in East Africa, Kenya maybe, that has a culture of cattle herding on foot, and also produces most of the world&rsquo;s top middle distance runners?  It was a long time ago that I read that so my details are shaky, but that clearly sounds like culture influencing evolution.  </p>

		<p># 23 said &#8220;Genes create phenotypes, phenotypes create cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me expand on that: Genes create phenotypes, phenotypes create cultures, culture is part of the environment, which then selects.  i.e., whether it is cold winters (non-culture) or rearing cows &amp; having milk (culture), both can act to select for certain genes.  In both cases, the surrounding environment (natural &amp; cultural) is determining who lives and who dies, who breeds successfully and who does not.   </p>

		<p>Asians and bad driving is not well supported by the data.</p>
<p>New Zealand statistics:<br>
&#8220;People of Asian ethnicity make up 6.6 per cent of the New Zealand resident population.</p>
<p>* Last year drivers identified as being Asian were involved in 8 per cent of injury traffic crashes where ethnicity was recorded, and 5 per cent of fatal crashes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>New Zealand is not the world, anonymous.  Oriental drivers exist in many other White countries and seem to have bad driving reputations in many of them.  Perhaps NZ has stricter licensing procedures than other places.  Perhaps NZ lies about race, like all the other White countries.  </p>

		<p>The marxists still operate the same way, simply making statements and pushing them as facts, in a &#8216;by the way&rsquo; or very casual manner. When you see statements like &#8220;&hellip; discredited ideas linking genetics and race,&#8221; you can bet nothing at all has been discredited. They use the same tactic whether it&rsquo;s claiming something has been extensively studied or that race is a &#8220;social concept&#8221; and so on. Just another of their worn out tactics. </p>
