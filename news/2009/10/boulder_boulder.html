<h1><a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/election/ci_13629085">Boulder, Boulder County: Recruitment Key to Finding Minority Leaders</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heath Urie, Daily Camera (Boulder), October 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many Boulder city officials, past and present, agree that more needs to be done to recruit Hispanics, Latinos and other minorities into local government.</p>
<p>Realizing that finding and providing leadership opportunities to those underrepresented groups has been difficult over the years, there&rsquo;s a renewed push at the city and county levels to reach out to potential minority leaders.</p>
<p>The Boulder-based Community Foundation in June launched the Boulder County Leadership Fellows Program in an effort to recruit a diverse group of people into leadership roles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The program grew out of a 2008 survey that concluded enrollment costs prohibited many people of color from participating in leadership cultivation classes, and that Boulder County lacks opportunities for diverse groups of people to have mentoring relationships with local leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some argue that Boulder&rsquo;s voters have made that participation more difficult.</p>
<p>In 2004, Boulder&rsquo;s Council Charter Revision Committee decided not to adopt recommendations that non-U.S. citizens should be allowed to serve on city boards and commissions.</p>
<p>The city last year took the issue to voters, who narrowly defeated a measure that would have allowed non-citizens who were 18 or older and had lived in the city for at least a year to serve on boards and commissions.</p>
<p>City Councilwoman Angelique Espinoza said the measure would have been a good step toward showing that Boulder is open to Latino participation, in particular.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boulder County, meanwhile, is also continuing its efforts to recruit people of color to serve on local boards and committees, through its People Engaged in Raising Leaders program.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Denver can cut back on minority hiring to help Boulder out. The state of Colorado too, and Majority-minority cities and regions, like Memphis, Cleveland, and DC, perhaps they can help Boulder with this difficult situation too. </p>

		<p>Right, we need more nonwhites in positions of power because taxes are too low and these same groups have done SUCH a good job running their 3rd World homelands.</p>

		<p>Are these people completly insane!!?? WHY on earth would they allow a non US-citizen who has only been in the city for a year to serve on anything? NARROWLY defeated a measure that would have allowed them to serve? What is wrong with the people in this town? People like this scare the hell out of me. As one poster always says&hellip; God help us all!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not enough non-whites involved in local government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, please, please.  No more non-whites in government.  Once they get into a governmental position they ALL automatically use the forum to denigrate whites and whine that their tribe is being discriminated against.</p>
<p>No more crybabies and whiners.  I&rsquo;m sick of it, as is everybody else.</p>

		<p>I live in Denver and Boulder is a liberal, loony, hippieville.  Boulder has low crime rate and is predominately white. Black and hispanics areas of Denver are not good places to be in.  Hello?  Anyone notice a pattern here?</p>

		<p>A few years ago now, Boulder, the city, CO., was looking for low income individuals and homeless folks to migrate to the city and take up &#8220;residence&#8221;. Folks from NYC were encourgaged to move west with one way bus tickets and such. Seems Boulder the city did not qualify for certain federal government grants because it was too RICH! Richness was not seen as a blessing? Was seen as a curse? NOT enough diversity from homeless and street people being present.</p>
<p>NO ONE from NYC even accepted the one-way offer. Too cold was the consensus opinion from the NYC experts.</p>
<p>Boulder felt BAD?</p>

		<p>Gosh, I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know the difference between a &#8220;Latino&#8221; and an &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;? </p>
<p>Is one kind less of an illegal alien than the other?</p>
<p>And who cares?</p>

		<p>I lived in Boulder for over a decade. Do not underestimate the general detachment from reality. Last time I was in town, the big scandal was a decision to relocate (not kill, move) a colony of prairie dogs (burrowing rodents) so the University could build more labs. </p>
<p>Boulder is 95+% white and about 2% NAM. The only nonwhites play on the football team and run the ethnic restaurants on every corner. They also commit the only crimes in a town where violent crime is nearly unheard of. It is a little utopia with beautiful people living beautiful lives and thinking beautiful thoughts under beautiful weather. </p>
<p>At the same time, Boulderites see the world as a dystopia of sexism, racism and strife, and are constantly trying to expiate themselves of their sins, which are especially heinous if they are male. The obvious connection between the huge white majority and Scandinavian lifestyle is just too much to deal with, and they practice doublethink until their brains are like pretzels. </p>
