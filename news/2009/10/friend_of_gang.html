<h1>Friend of Gang Rape Victim Blasts School Officials Over Safety</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Moni Basu, CNN, October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>She had come alone to the Richmond High School homecoming dance, gorgeous in a sparkling purple dress and faux diamond baubles. The DJ played salsa, meringue, rap. When the teenager disappeared, her friends thought she had gone home early.</p>
<p>Except she never said goodbye.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were going to go look for her,&#8221; said Kami Baker, 16, a junior at the school.</p>
<p>The next day, Baker learned the ugly truth about what had happened to her friend.</p>
<p>According to police, she had been gang raped and beaten for almost 21⁄2 hours and left unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I busted up crying,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baker blamed school district officials for not doing enough to protect her school  &mdash;  and her friend. She said none of the four officers who were at the homecoming dance was patrolling the school premises even though there were a dozen young men hanging out just a few feet from the gym entrance. She says school officials chose not to take any action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs,&#8221; Baker said at the hearing. &#8220;The officers  &mdash;  not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. checking either. The assistant principal looked outside and actually saw those men, and did nothing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baker took the podium with her younger sister, Barbie, a freshman at the school, who had spent a chunk of Saturday evening with the rape victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;This story has disrupted the school&rsquo;s morale greatly, including my own. I am friends with the girl,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;When I started here, I felt extremely unsafe and so did she, due to the lack of police officers and security officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baker later described the 15-year-old girl as a churchgoer who struggled to fit in at Richmond High.</p>

		<p>Raping white girls is used subconsciously as a weapon of ethnic cleansing by the invading mestizo army.</p>
<p>White children should go to all white schools, all other races hate us and try to destroy us.</p>
<p>Watching Rick Sanchez complaining about the racist white owner of a restaurant who asked his mestizo employees to anglicize their names and ignoring the gang rape of the poor white girl by the mestizo beasts only show the anti white bias of CNN and this so called journalist Rick Sanchez.</p>
<p>This rape is only a sign of things to come when the minorities will assume political power.<br>

		<p>I think that the school&rsquo;s security were scared to confront dozens of non-white young men loitering around the school premises.  If they would have, then they would have been hounded for racial profiling.  </p>

		<p> So it now appears that at least two of the four defendants were black. And the other two apparently were Mexican. Is this not the future of our country, in microcosm, if some radical steps are not taken? Blacks and Hispanics ganging up on a diminishing number of White people, and &#8220;having their way&#8221; with them, probably in both a literal and a figurative way?</p>
<p> At least these girls were willing to come forward and point the finger of accusation at blatant favoring of the minorities/majority at the school. Wonder what will happen to them now? Perhaps the woefully inadequate security situation at that school, and others, will be improved. But don&rsquo;t bet the farm on it. Somebody might yell, &#8220;Racism!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since she is White there is a good chance her friend was too. If true, this in no way will be a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime. It will be a &#8220;random&#8221; act of violence. Fools	</p>

		<p>Oh yes, here we go again, blame the &#8220;system&#8221; if non-Whites commit a crime. It&rsquo;s funny that I don&rsquo;t recall ANY sort of sercurity in or around any of my schools growing up [ unless you count the dreaded &#8216;hall monitor&rsquo; ] and we never had anything like this going on, and that wasn&rsquo;t all that long ago. Of course, we also didn&rsquo;t have alot of thugs-oops-&#8220;diversity&#8221; in them either! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that CNN even reported this crime.  CNN is at the forefront of anti-white hatred in the media.  But it is not enough to simply report the crime.  It should also be reported in context and much emphasis should be placed on the racial aspect.  After all, if a group of white boys had gang raped a Hispanic or black girl, CNN would have reported the racial aspect of it ad nauseum.  Is the mainstream media to blame for the rapes of white women and girls by blacks and Hispanics?  Absolutely!  They play a very active role in indoctrinating young white women to trust blacks and Hispanics.  Take this for example:</p>

		<p>The Leftist media will not let out the suspect&rsquo;s ethnicity.  They refuse to prosecute blacks and Hispanics under the hate crime bill, of course Obama ignores 85% of interracial crime and gay molestation.  If this were a black teen raped, the media would be swarming the area.</p>

		<p>The second part of her speech (transcribed below)specifically addresses race.  It sounds like she is trying to play the race card to shame the district into providing better security for whites at RHS (or at least for her and her sister), by noting the differances between security and race at RHS and at another local school. Unfortunately, she blows it at the end by explicitly identifying herself as white, rather than just someone who is concerned that blacks and Mexicans are being discriminated against. Reading between the lines, one can infer that it&rsquo;s probably not too cool of a thing to be white at RHS. Maybe someone who is more clued in on the specifics of the region could explain the details of what she&rsquo;s getting at?</p>
<p>Kami Baker:<br>
&#8220;This story is blown beyond its proportion due to race and location. Here at this school, me and my sister are minorities. But in our reality the minorities are what is around me. They recieve little necessities, like security, facilities and support. At Dienza, there is a new facility being built. The gates block people from leaving or entering the campus, and there are more officers to protect than there are here. There was a rape at Dienza&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s homecoming, and there was a lockdown. I remember it quite vividly because the rally was cancelled, and there was no homecoming dance. Here there was a rape, and the news is covering it and there is media everywhere because RHS has been ostracized by the district. No matter how many ways we look at it, we are ostracized. Because of our race and minorities, there are Mexicans and blacks around me everywhere and at Dienza there are more Asian and whites. And when you said Ivy League Connections earlier, you only included the Asian names. I am white[said angrily and accompanied by a gimpy black power salute]. I am an Ivy League Connection, and for you to exclude all the minorities at this school is wrong. [scattered, light applause as she storms off the stage. A ticked off looking minority can be seen in the background.]</p>

		<p>Being a native resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, this behavior in no way surprises me. Even though I don&rsquo;t live in Oakland, but rather a small city next door, I had the privilege of attending a private middle school in Oakland. Even though this was a &#8220;private school,&#8221; it had a &#8220;public purpose.&#8221; Therefore, I saw a good number of blacks, including those from the inner city. Now, you may be wondering why I bring up blacks since only one of the four individuals charged was black. Well, I have seen firsthand how many Hispanics emulate black culture. In addition to adopting a ghetto look, many can even freely use the N Word without any consequences. I myself went through a &#8220;wanna be black&#8221; phase during early adolescence, and I don&rsquo;t think I could be any more buffoonish or ignorant than I was back then. I have noticed that many blacks and Hispanics who adopt black culture are aggressive, short-tempered, rude, and impulsive. My 8th grade year, a white girl was sexually assaulted in the bathroom by this thuggish black guy. Even though he ultimately did not come back to school, many still wanted to forgive him and give him a second chance, even the white girls who may very well have been that sexual assault victim! The multiracial dogma and politically correct environment of that school combined with my high school experiences made me a white nationalist. Granted, one of those kids who participated in the Richmond rape was a white guy. However, the kinds of white guys who participate in such rapes with blacks and Hispanics tend to be &#8220;wanna be ghetto&#8221; types. Still, that doesn&rsquo;t excuse this kid&rsquo;s actions or support the notion that white kids are all angels, because many of them are not. However, there is a reason why I rarely venture into Oakland when I&rsquo;m back at home from college. I have never been to Richmond and don&rsquo;t intend on taking a tour anytime soon. I am sure many people here have seen The Simpsons Movie. Remember when the EPA director places a dome over Springfield in order to protect surrounding areas from its environmental degradation? Though this is definitely unrealistic, I indulge a fantasy where we place some kind of dome over places such as Richmond and Oakland. Too bad fantasies don&rsquo;t have an impact on reality.</p>

		<p>In this world - now in this country, you are either prepared, or you are a future victim. There is no freedom left in the usa, only trying to decide who will attempt to kill, rape or take advantage of you first.<br>
I homeschool my kids. They get a FIRM dose of racial reality. They learn martial arts, they ARE able to protect themselves, even against adults. No tae kwon do B$ either. Stun guns, foaming mace, all were made to be concealed, for personal protection. Of course, caution should ALWAYS be used. In this case, against 14 horny blacks looking for a white girl to rape, there&rsquo;s only two solutions. smith and wesson. <br>
I&rsquo;d bet anything this DOES NOT go down as a hate crime AND the perps walk on lack of evidence/ UNDERAGE.<br>
What a joke our legal system has become. </p>

		<p>Excerpt from the Oakland Tribune:</p>
<p>&#8220;Police say the victim left the dance about 9:30 p.m. and walked north on 23rd Street, intending to phone her father for a ride home. But before she did, a classmate called to her from behind a chain-link fence that separates a campus courtyard from the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her friend called to her, then hopped the fence and escorted her&#8221; up Emeric Avenue to a low gate that led into a campus parking lot, Lt. Mark Gagan said.</p>
<p>They joined a group of teens and young adults hanging out and drinking in the poorly lit courtyard.</p>
<p>The victim drank a large amount of brandy in a short period of time while socializing, police said, then collapsed. Someone dragged her to a bench, where several people stripped her, beat her, stole her jewelry and other belongings, and raped her.</p>
<p>The sexual assault continued for about two hours, detectives estimate, with several young men and boys taking part, possibly including some who arrived after the attack began, as word spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened to this young lady was truly reprehensible.  The article used the term &#8220;escorted&#8221; which leaves me wondering whether or not she was targeted and if her so-called &#8220;friend&#8221; led her straight into the lion&rsquo;s den.  A similar thing happened not too long ago in England which resulted in the death of a teen-aged boy.</p>
<p>Young women just aren&rsquo;t safe on city streets and parents need to do a better job of impressing upon their children the dangers of being out alone and associating with certain segments of the population.  Diversity and multiculturalism may be fine, politically correct ideals but we need to pay more attention to the hard realities of life.</p>

		<p>The school is 2% white. While the victim could be white, the statistics are against it. If you go to schools that are split up between hispanics and blacks with a few whites thrown in, the whites ALWAYS hang out with the hispanic kids.  The fact that the girl was their friend does not mean she is white.</p>
<p>I was wondering what kind of parent would send their child to such a school, and then I saw the name of the little sister and the hair color on the older one.</p>

		<p>These naive white women who end up getting sexually abused are the products of our stupid liberal age. White women are brought up by our society and by their parents to believe that men of all cultures behave alike and that women can go wherever they like and behave as they like. The Third world is full of cases of naive liberal White women behaving in ways and going to places where the local westernised women would never go and in return getting sexually abused. Men are programmed to behave in a particular way by instincts. For men in the third world a woman who drinks alone with a large number of men probably is loose and probably wants a gang bang. It is only White men and probably East Asian men who have suppressed those instincts in the name of male chivalry and feminism. Not so in the rest of the world. But liberalism has taught us that to discriminate in any way between men is racist. No wonder White women have such a bad reputation in the Third World as being sexually loose. However now the third world has moved inside the Western world. They are not safe to behave as they please in Paris or Los Angeles any more.<br>
There was an excellent discussion on this subject at Lawrence Auster&rsquo;s blog and is a must read for everyone.<br>
<a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/011090.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/011090.html</a><br>
Solution<br>
Firstly it is the duty of White  parents to teach their daughters and sons that all cultures and races do not behave alike. It is also the duty of our menfolk to rise to the protection of our men. Our men have given up this duty the result of which is White women have become the plaything of the entire world. Simple common sense and discrimination could have saved this poor child.<br>

		<p>The black man on the right didn&rsquo;t seem to excited to hear a white girl throw-back the &#8216;minority&rsquo; card; neither did the partial-latino guy in the middle.  Look at his smug &#8216;pseudo-shocked&rsquo; face.  Wait until these whites start to band-together and push-back.  I think Reverend Manning said it best that y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t seen rioting until you&rsquo;ve seen white people riot; the NRA will be marching through your town.   I think we&rsquo;ve been pacified by all this talk of &#8216;feelings&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;fairness&rsquo;.  I hope that more and more people speak out against this crime.  Please   &mdash;   post this on your my$pace and f@cebook pages.  People are often worried or blocked (as with &#8216;Websense&rsquo; blocking this site due to alleged &#8216;racism&rsquo; and -my favorite - &#8216;nationalism&rsquo;)from coming here    &mdash;   we need to get these stories and our views into public realms.  We&rsquo;re preaching to the choir here on AmRen.  We need to post this video and others like it to show that &#8216;anti-White&rsquo; racism is real.  We need to show that you can&rsquo;t have equality, then have an &#8216;appreciation&rsquo; month telling everyone how &#8216;DIFFERENT&rsquo; and &#8216;SPECIAL&rsquo; a particular race is.   Show everyone that our current administration is running us into the ground and opening the floodgates to be overrun and subjugated.  If you&rsquo;re 18 - buy a rifle and shotgun; 21 - buy a few pistols to go with them.  Arm yourself and practice;  Keep a &#8216;river-gun&rsquo; (aka &#8216;trash gun&rsquo;) in your trunk or a hidden compartment in your car. Reload with saboted rounds and have a moderate stockpile.  We need to be vigilant in protecting each other; we need to think of the big-picture.  We need to start taking care of our own. We need to stop letting us become fragmented from other people like us.  We need to show that we&rsquo;re not out looking for violence, but that it has been, and still is, looking for us and that we will meet them with equal force.  In lockup or not, these assailants will get their natural-justice.  Rapists and child molesters always get what they deserve in prison.  </p>

		<p>The girl was a blonde haired white girl, unfortunately she identified a black as a boyfriend and another black as a former one on her my space which we accessed via the Baker girls My Space.  She has a picture of the girl in a purple dress which leads to the girl&rsquo;s MY Space.</p>
<p>Hence, the black/hispanic rapists and the lack of guilt about the white girls plight, they wanted to damage and debase her because they hate whites, so why do we keep allowing them in to kill us all?</p>

		<p>Blacks and hispanics can&rsquo;t control themselves around White girls. They are just simply too beautiful to resist, and being rejected by one makes them feel worthless.</p>
<p>Same goes for Asian women to an extent; they come after me because they like me because I&rsquo;m White and blue eyed. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many Asian women I know that are very aggressive about getting a blue eyed, blonde haired white man, so as to lap up the last remaining genetics on planet earth. Blacks and hispanics are the same. It&rsquo;s pretty much a free for all for the last White genetics on the face of the globe.</p>
<p>Anyone that says Asians should be included in our plight is delusional and insane. </p>

		<p>Thanks #7 for the youtube clip, it just ruined my lunch. Sadly, it seems that most White people are like this and I&rsquo;m sure all of us here have had their share of them. I wonder how many poor Whites have been taken in and helped by a rich black family! Most of us know what REALLY happens when Whites allow a black to live in their home. </p>

		<p>The girl was identified as White by Internet sources who spoke to people at her school.  A MySpace page appeared verified this.</p>

		<p>Old Vet, How are you certain that was the girl? When I access the Baker girl&rsquo;s MySpave it says her friends are private and can&rsquo;t be seen except for the top six, none of which match the description you gave. Maybe she just changed the setting, or was it the younger sister&rsquo;s MySpace you are speaking of?</p>

		<p>I have been following this story on television since it first broke and immediately assumed that the rapists and onlookers were black.  A check of the Internet revealed that they were mostly Mexican.  Is the media responsible for a big cover-up here?   You bet they are!   CNN has bent over backwards to conceal the race of the perpetrators and has blurred the brief TV images of these rapists as they emerge from police cars.  Sickest comments of all came from Jane Velez Mitchell on CNN Headline News who told us of her outrage but would not identify the rapist as her fellow Hispanics.  Will the local authorities, the FBI or Barack Obama call this a hate crime?   Don&rsquo;t hold your breath!</p>

		<p>One aspect of the problem is one I have seen in my own family.  Teenaged girls want to be popular.  Although others have hit on this, it is an important aspect of how and why white girls end up in these situations.  When most of the schools athletes are non-white, at least the basketball teams, the girls, already propelled by the MSM and PC cultures, find it an easy leap to dating or even responding to an invitation to &#8220;be bad.&#8221;  All this, thanks to over two decades of pop culture headed by the likes of Michael Jackson (I&rsquo;m Bad) and Madonna (I&rsquo;m your white ho).</p>
<p>I used to live in the SF Bay region.  I know Richmond, and it has been a bad place for a long time.  I was very glad when the freeway system was built up so that I no longer had to drive down its avenues when commuting.  Why any white parents would still have their children attending schools there is beyond me.  They must be people who look in the mirror and see a non-white.  That is a result of decades of Orwellian brain washing.</p>
<p>Can these people be saved?  13 Anonymous White Person illustrates what I posted on the NPR column today.  The future of a White Survival movement depends upon liberal converts.  It is going to require some broadening of the typical conservative philosophical/religious positions for this to work.  For example, when we consider that the internet is 40 years old today and was invented by a Jew at UCLA, the issue presents.  The Jew was white and the school a leader in today&rsquo;s perception of a liberal university.  I have been using the internet since it became available to the public and I used to work in DOS.  Back then, and up to 9/11, my observation is that liberals dominated the internet.  Yet, Amren and all its posters depend upon it for much communication and organization of the concerned white community.  I think reason and reasonable accomodation is the path to our success because Christian Whites never did soley enable Western culture.  We must be that way because of the complexity of reality.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I busted up crying,&rdquo; Baker said.</p>
<p>Indeed.  Crying IS evil, and deserves to be &#8220;busted up.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Strange numbers.  Regardless, I envy this creature&rsquo;s powers of prestidigitation.  How else could one know, by looking at any given person, whether or not (s)he had identification?  Because people with identification cards wear them on their foreheads, non?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&ldquo;The officers &mdash; not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus&#8221;</p>
<p>As though:<br>
1) She watched every person enter for the first time and verified that there were no ID checks performed on any of these individuals, but also<br>
2) ID checks always prevent violence, and<br>
3) People &#8220;outside of the campus&#8221; are perhaps to blame, IF her claim of ID checks doesn&rsquo;t wash.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;This story has disrupted the school&rsquo;s morale greatly, including my own. I am friends with the girl,&rdquo; Baker said. &ldquo;When I started here, I felt extremely unsafe and so did she, due to the lack of police officers and security officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words:<br>
1) I feel responsible for not calling attention to an unsafe situation<br>
2) I will claim friendship to gain my fifteen minutes<br>
3) Everyone &#8220;felt&#8221; unsafe - due to the &#8220;lack of police officers and security officers&#8221; yet earlier she admits they were present, but did not check identification</p>

		<p>Just to confirm, yes, the victim was a white girl. After seeing her friend Kami on CNN, I contacted her (Kami) via her Facebook page. That page was set up before the attack, and the Facebook profile photos match the girl on CNN, so I&rsquo;m sure it was a legit profile. </p>
<p>I asked her if she thought the attack was racially motivated, and this was her naive response:</p>
<p>Kami sent you a message.</p>
<p>Re: hey</p>
<p>&#8220;i dont think the entire event was race related, but i do feel like the case itself progressed to national media due to the attackers being latino and the vicim being caucasian.&#8221;<br>

That saddest part of this is that even as a white minority surrounded by hating and hostile non-whites, she will still not admit the situation is what it is. Even at the approach of our oncoming racial winter, our racial &#8220;twilight of the gods&#8221;, the bulk majority of our folk have been so thoroughly wiped clean of all racial pride and at worst filled with hate and guilt for their own blood, that it will take a herculean effort to save our people from extinction. Even if you are alone, you are a vital weapon. Believe in yourself.</p>

		<p>Richmond High School Students are required to wear ID tags around their necks, so individuals without lanyards with tags hanging down are readily identifiable.  Ivy League connections is a program in which hard working young people who attend low performing schools are given opportunities to learn about Ivy League Colleges  by visiting them and working with mentors who attend the participating schools.  Many of these young people go on to attend Ivy League schools.</p>

		<p>This is the CNN version: no mention whatsoever of the race or ethnicity of the thugs involved. Typical of CNN!</p>
<p>I read on another site that the rapists were mostly Latino, but some Black. And with the kind of mentality those kinds of thugs have, I suppose they thought that poor girl was «askin&rsquo; for it», because she was wearing a nice dress and jewels&hellip;</p>

I understand your point, &#8220;WASP insurgent&#8221;, but i don&rsquo;t believe that tripe for a minute. No offense, but I believe this is your way of saying &#8220;its everybody else but me!&#8221;, which may console you. It does not however console me. I place the blame only upon the shoulders of the white men of the past, along with my current inability to work hard for our future- but that us changing. White women are the best, I love them. So what, if many appear to hold views of that nature? The mass mind is easily thrown one way or another, and with the right people in power the obvious would be attained.</p>
