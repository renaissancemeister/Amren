<h1>Racism in Paradise</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tarek Fatah, National Post (Toronto), October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Saudi cleric named Sheikh Muhammad al-Munajid has promised on Saudi TV that the virgins we Muslims will get in paradise will be white. If you blow yourself up in a martyrdom operation, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with 72 pure women, and not one of them will be black or Indian, or even Arab or Iranian.</p>
<p>This is not the first strange thing Sheikh al-Munajid has said. He is the same man who once issued a fatwa against Mickey Mouse. And when Western and Arab media ridiculed him for it, he defended himself by insisting that &#8220;the real issue being discussed was the harmful rodent &#8216;the mouse,&rsquo; not Mickey.&#8221;</p>
<p>What follows edited excerpt from an interview with al-Munajid, which aired on Al-Majd TV on July 25, 2009, and has been transcribed and translated by MEMRI  &mdash;  The Middle East Research Institute.</p>
<p><b>Muhammad sl-Munajid: </b>Allah said that the black-eyed virgins are beautiful white young women, with black pupils and very white retinas, whose skin is so delicate and bright that it causes confusion.</p>
<p>Allah said that they are like hidden pearls. They are all the same age, morally and physically beautiful. They are like precious gems and pearls in their splendor, their clarity, their purity, and their whiteness. Each one of them is so beautiful that you can see the bone-marrow through the delicate flesh on their legs.</p>
<p>Whereas the women of this world may suffer, for days and nights, from menstruation, from blood for 40 days after childbirth, from vaginal bleeding and from diseases  &mdash;  the women of Paradise are pure, unblemished, menstruation-free, free of feces, urine, phlegm, children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Moreover, Allah cleaned them of all impure and foul things, both in appearance and character. In character, they are not jealous, hateful, or angry. They are not greedy.</p>
<p>They are restricted to tents, locked up for the husband. There is no such thing as going out. When he comes home  &mdash;  they are there. There is no such thing in Paradise as a man coming home and not finding his wife there. Allah described them as women who lower their gaze, and never look at anybody but their husband.</p>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>You said the woman looks only at her husband, but today, things are different. Today, husbands don&rsquo;t look only at their wives, or vice versa  &mdash;  except for a few, on whom Allah has taken mercy.</p>
<p><b>al-Munajid: </b>There are some pious, pure men, who have eyes only for their wives, and there are some pious, pure and obedient wives, who have eyes only for their husbands. But today, people&rsquo;s eyes roam freely. The Internet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The people of this world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is a big difference when it comes to deriving pleasure. In this world, men work hard and tire themselves out in order to derive pleasure. The Prophet Muhammad says that in Paradise, a man gets the strength of 100 men when it comes to eating, drinking, passion and sex.<br/>

		<p>They hate white people so much, as a matter of fact, I think that mulatto Arab racial jealousy against whites (including I&rsquo;raeli Jews) is the reason why violent interpretations of the Koran are so popular.  The &#8220;War on Terror,&#8221; I think, is a very low level worldwide race war, with most of the world&rsquo;s non-whites on the side of the Muslims and most whites in countries that the U.S. haven&rsquo;t tried to make mad on the part of the United States.</p>
<p>Yet, when they want their 72 virgins, they want them to be of the infidel race.</p>

		<p>Very strange cult this Islam, I really don&rsquo;t understand the premise of the 72 Virgins, are these the souls of deceased women, and if so, where are all these white virgins coming from and why are they in Islamic heaven? Since very few white women are Islamic can we assume they raiding christian heaven stealing our women?</p>
<p>Also that must be rough on these men&rsquo;s wives, most Christians tell their spouse they will see them in heaven after death, but here when your husband passes away he gets to deflower 72 young women?  Do the wives get to join the harem as #73, or do they get 72 young studs to pleasure them? Somehow I doubt it&hellip; Do women even have Souls in Islam or are they considered more like animals or objects?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m totally confused.  If a Muslim woman were to die performing a righteous suicide bombing on some evil non-believers, would she receive 72 white virgin females in Paradise?   Or, would she receive 72 white, brown or black virgin Muslims men?  Cold she pick among these groups?  What about Chinese or American Indian men?  Would her men be kept in a tent and look down when she entered, or would SHE have to look down?  Who would look down? Would you be allowed to look sideways or up?  Is there a web-site that can answer these questions? Perhaps www:http/virginsforbombers<br/>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this guy was talking about &#8220;race&#8221;.  There are obviously Arabs who are quite pale in places like Lebanon and those who are quite black in places like Sudan.  He is just talking about skin color.  I don&rsquo;t speak a lick of Arabic, but I&rsquo;ve spent some time in Asia.  Chinese and Japanese will refer to people of their own ethnic group was &#8220;white people&#8221; and &#8220;black people&#8221; meaning they are pale or dark, has nothing to do with race.  I don&rsquo;t believe there is a word for &#8220;tan skin&#8221; in Chinese (Mandarin).  They just say you &#8220;became black&#8221;.</p>

		<p>When you are in heaven, where do you &#8220;go out to&#8221;?</p>
<p>And you return to the tent and the whitey girl is waiting for you? Of course you must live in a tent, bedouin style.</p>
<p>I think that the Arab most coveted those slaves that were the white females captured by the Tartar slave raiders of old. &#8220;Harvesting the steppe&#8221; they called it. Ukrainians, Poles, Russian women. Light skinned, fair haired, etc.</p>
<p>And remember woman, lower your gaze and don&rsquo;t look at other men - - something may happen, even in heaven!</p>
<p>And this guy &#8220;assures&#8221; his followers that it will be whitey wimmens ONLY!?</p>

		<p>These heavenly women sound like those Japanese female robots I once saw that keep Japanese men &#8220;from being lonely.&#8221; The Japanese robots also do not have the unpleasant waste products produced by mammals.</p>
<p>But the fact that, robotic qualities aside, the heavenly women are white tells me that our white women are the most desirable on earth.</p>
<p>For their physical appearance, anyway.</p>
<p>The fact that the heavenly men are super-studs tells me what  their priorities are, here on earth, and what they value above all else! </p>
<p>Stay away from our white female mammals, O ye sons of Mohammed!<br/>
Go buy a robot.  </p>

		<p>Oh why doesn&rsquo;t he just come right out and say it. I&rsquo;m sure most of these men secretly desire white women period. All their women pretty much look the same. Black hair, brown skin and black or brown eyes. Compare that to white women with our variety of hair and eye color. No wonder we would be considered a heavenly gift.</p>

<p>Why do so many people on here insist that arabs are half black?  Most of them, to me, look just like us except with much darker features.  People need to understand that there is a hierarchy within the caucasian race.  Just because arabs and Indians don&rsquo;t act the same as Europeans, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they have some black ancestory.  Give me a break.</p>

<p>This is what I was getting at in my other post. You are implying that Saudi Arabians would be white had they not mixed with blacks.  Wrong.  They would have still been brown-skinned caucasians.</p>
<p>Why do the people on here always insist that arabs are a product of whites mixing with blacks?  Do you NOT understand that there is a hierarchy within the caucasian race that has always existed?</p>
<p>By your criteria we should believe that Amazon Indians and Polynesians came about after blacks intermixed with Northern Asians (Japanese people).  Give me a break.</p>
<p>Just as Asians have hierarchies within their race in its pure form, so do caucasians.</p>
<p><br/>
When you refer to someone as &#8220;white&#8221; you should only be refering to Indo-European people.  Very few of these people exist in the Middle East today.  </p>
<p>When you refer to someone as &#8220;caucasian&#8221;, you are including Indo-Europeans, brown-skinned semites or arabs, as well as dark-brown skinned Indians.  </p>
<p>An arab is an arab. An arab originated in the Arabian peninsula and has absolutely nothing to do with either whites (Europeans) or blacks.  He is a branch of the caucasian race. Get it straight.</p>

		<p>Islam certainly seems to have an &#8220;interpretive&#8221; side to it. Muslim clerics have a gift for making things up&hellip;if you&rsquo;re even the basic student of the &#8220;religion&#8221; of Islam, reference Muhammad&rsquo;s improv when confronted with his so-called Satanic verses. </p>
<p>As for real-world Islam, women occupy a horrid state of existence that mainstream journalism will never accurately portray. I saw some of the most heinous brutality against women while deployed in the Al Anbar province.</p>
<p>The most I could think of as an offset was to purposefully hand out candy to the little girls. I ignored the male children completely, much to the consternation of the adult males. </p>
<p>In their eyes though I was a two hundred pound Marine, dressed in full battle gear and armed to the teeth. Muslim males will quickly push womenand children around, but I was a fight they didn&rsquo;t want. </p>
<p>My only concern was what harm might befall the girls upon my departure. </p>
<p>What a pathetic excuse for a &#8220;religion.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The fact that muslims apparently find bone marrow to be an erogenous zone notwithstanding, many questions do remain. For example, how come Mickey Mouse is still marching down Disney&rsquo;s Main Street every night if there&rsquo;s a fatwa? </p>
<p>If the 72 virgins are so devoted and pure in character, then why are they &#8220;restricted to tents&#8221; and &#8220;locked up&#8221; for the husband? Are they planning an escape? To where? Some other tent?</p>
<p>Once the 72 virgins start becoming non-virgins does the martyr get replacement virgins or does he keep the originals?</p>
<p>If you are a muslim man but do not have the splendid opportunity to blow yourself up in a martyrdom operation, but instead die of natural causes, how many virgins do you get? More importantly, are they white?</p>
<p>I suppose in muslim heaven you can tell where the martyrs live by the size of the tent. You need a pretty big tent for 72 virgins. Granted, you won&rsquo;t need bathroom facilities or toilets for the virgins but they still take up space. </p>
<p>Overall, it sounds like a crummy deal for the virgins. I suppose the best thing you could say is that at least they don&rsquo;t have to worry about monthly cramping.</p>
<p>Define religion any way you like but seriously, this is not religion - it&rsquo;s insanity. Only insane people become suicide bombers and killers so they can have eternal sex with 72 inexperienced strangers. In fact, any religion that has to promise such a &#8220;reward&#8221; as an incentive is spiritually bankrupt.</p>
<p>Sure, you can be glib and comical about this but not when civilization is hanging in the balance.<br/>

<p>The term &#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; is very misleading also and should be redefined to either mean white only or non-white only.</p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what the women get out of this deal, but women have always been near the bottom of the totem pole in Islam. However ridiculous, I have to admit the Muslims seem to know the thoughts of the average sensual man; whereas, the Christian heaven seems somewhat vague and unspecified, and the traditional Jews really don&rsquo;t have one. I&rsquo;m not surprised the &#8220;wish maidens&#8221; in this Muslim heaven are white. </p>

		<p>Courtney, some Arabs do indeed look like us, perhaps Mediterranean-style.</p>
<p>But they do not seem to  act like us. Many seem to be over-sexed, like Blacks.</p>
<p>They seem to like violence, like Blacks.</p>
<p>I was struck by this when Arafat died. There were all these people shooting off guns and swarming about.</p>
<p>Arabs did have a pretty good civilization in the Middle-Ages, though. Perhaps those Arabs were more closely Caucasian? Or, perhaps the &#8220;upper-classes&#8221; are more Caucasian?</p>
<p>Also, in reading just the first few pages of The Arabian Nights, I was struck by the portrayal of Blacks as being stupid, oversexed, and desiring lighter-skinned women. In that book, a prince&rsquo;s wife has nightly rendevous with a stupid, slobbering Black man who comes down from a tree, monkey-style.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Also that must be rough on these men&rsquo;s wives, most Christians tell their spouse they will see them in heaven after death,&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. Muslim men dream of raping 72 &#8216;virgins&rsquo; (i.e. pre-pubescent girls - i.e. they are PAEDOPHILES), when they get to &#8216;heaven&rsquo;, whereas Christians (and probably every other religion that believes in a heaven) dream of meeting their LOVED ONES again.</p>
<p>Of course, muslims don&rsquo;t know what love is, so how could we expect them to dream of their &#8216;loved&rsquo; ones?</p>

		<p>In the time I spent in Turkey (worst decision of my young life), I was not able to freely speak with men. Even asking for directions was a problem (I spoke Turkish). Part of it is the culture; women do not genereally speak to men on their own, they usually have a male friend who will ask for directions, for example. However, the fact that I was a young white female always brought me problems. I would sometimes have to walk away if the men thought I was interested in them, sometimes I would get followed. Usually the would go eventually stop following me, but on two occasions I had to go inside a store and wait a bit until they figured they would be noticed. All of this happened mostly in the capital of Ankara, a &#8220;modern&#8221; city.</p>

<p>Perfect post, Courtney. And yes, not all Arabs are dark, not all Arabs have black hair, not all Arabs are dark eyed. There is little to no difference between Greeks and Lebanese Arabs, some of the North African Berbers look like the Irish (no, they aren&rsquo;t mixed with European whites), etc.. There is not a definite Arab race at all. </p>
<p>By the way, Arab women -especially the educated ones- are very beautiful.</p>
<p>Being Muslim doesn&rsquo;t make you mixed or black, racially they are white.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean automatically they have a right to settle in Europe or North America. Only people in Europe can decide who is eligible.</p>

<p>   According to the Holy Koran, ever-lasting fire awaits evil Muslims and unbelievers. Once in awhile they cool you off with some boiling water. Christians and Jews can go to heaven as &#8220;Peoples of the Book&#8221; but I&rsquo;m not sure they get the same perks as Muslims. I mean you don&rsquo;t get the 72 beauties, rivers of wine, beautiful palaces, choice food, etc., etc.,as Orthodox Muslim males.  Naturally, Muslim women can go to heaven as well, but what they do in heaven is not really indicated in the Koran.  I suppose they can be reunited with their former husbands, who, I guess, could work them in between the virgins. </p>

		<p>I saw some of the most heinous brutality against women while deployed in the Al Anbar province.</p>
<p>The most I could think of as an offset was to purposefully hand out candy to the little girls. I ignored the male children completely, much to the consternation of the adult males.   My only concern was what harm might befall the girls upon my departure.<br/>
  &mdash;  Quiet Prof.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I can tell you, having had a somewhat similar experiences.  They will take the candy (or whatever you gave) away from them.  In Arab society, the strong take from the weak   &mdash;   this is true even among children. </p>
<p>I can also tell you that the adults will have suspicions as what are your &#8220;real&#8221; motives. You were being very naive. They don&rsquo;t understand such a thing as generosity without some underlying purpose behind it.  I learned that it is dangerous even to smile at a child, because the father will wonder what you are really up to.  And his suspicions will be quite ugly!  </p>
<p>Here, a smile at a little kid is just a smile.  But there, a smile means more.  I learned not to smile at little children.  And whatever you give them   &mdash;   candy or coins   &mdash;   will just be snatched away by the bigger ones after you go.</p>

		<p>The pure virgins in Paradise the Muslim men expect are not the souls of perfect women on Earth who have gone to Paradise.  Rather, they are thought to be made by Allah for the specific purpose of a male reward in Paradise.</p>
<p>As far as Muslim men desiring European women while they are on Earth, they want them sexually for flings but usually not as wives.  Muslim men consider European women to be loose and immoral infidels, so their interest in them is solely based on lust and the desire to &#8220;conquer&#8221; the women of another race.</p>

<p>Get it into your heads that arabs are their own people.  They are a branch of the caucasian race but they are NOT WHITE&hellip;nor do they have black intermixture.</p>

&#8220;Being Muslim doesn&rsquo;t make you mixed or black, racially they are white.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is generally true, though there is a huge variety of racial admixtures among them, so it&rsquo;s impossible to say that they are all of one race or another. </p>
<p>Those were Arabs.  However, as for Turks, it seems that they did not mix. It is true (above) about male and female slaves; all the black male slaves imported from Africa were castrated.  But it is my understanding that the Turks also practiced infanticide with any babies born to the females.  Hence, no mulattoes.  You can walk the streets of Istanbul today and you will see faces from all parts and races of the former Ottoman Empire   &mdash;   with one exception: no blacks and no mulattoes!  Black female slaves also brought the lowest prices, and in times of hardship they were the first ones thrown out of the household to go and beg for their living. Cruel, but true.  This was documented in an article in the New York Times back in the 1800s, when discussion about race was able to be more candid than today.</p>

__</p>
<p>The Mamluks were slave soldiers who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages.<br/>
From 1250 Egypt had been ruled by the Bahri dynasty of Kipchak Turk origin. White slaves from the Caucasus served in the army and formed an elite corps of troops eventually revolting in Egypt to form the Burgi dynasty. Mamluks were mainly responsible for the expulsion of the Crusaders from Palestine and preventing the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 14th century, Murad I (Ottoman Empire) built his own personal slave army called the Kapıkulu. The new force was based on the sultan&rsquo;s right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to Islam and trained in the sultan&rsquo;s personal service. In the devşirme (Turkish for &#8216;gathering&rsquo;), young Christian boys from the Balkans were taken away from their homes and families, converted to Islam and enlisted into special soldier classes of the Ottoman army or the civil service. These soldier classes were named Janissaries, the most famous branch of the Kapıkulu. By 1609 the Sultan&rsquo;s Kapıkulu forces increased to about 100,000!</p>

<p>An explanation from alledgedly moderate muslims I have heard, from a few places is the 72 virgins stuff was a mistranslation and it was supposed to be 72 grapes which apparently were all the rage back in the day in Arabia. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I buy it though  &mdash;  why in the afterlife would they be stingy with the grapes? 72 isn&rsquo;t  exactly even a full bunch, and after you eat em then do you get more? Or is it like an in flight snack as you ascend into heaven, like airplane peanuts on the heaven express? The virgin explanation seems more logical, as weird as it is.</p>
<p>Ooh found a source:</p>
<p>The word huri, universally interpreted by scholars as white-eyed virgins (who will serve the faithful in Paradise; Qur&rsquo;an 44:54, 52:20, 55:72, 56:22) means, according to Luxenberg, white grapes. He says that many Christian descriptions of Paradise describe it as abounding in pure white grapes. This sparked much joking in the Western press; suicide bombers would be expecting beautiful women and getting grapes.[11]</p>

You&rsquo;re right about the Mameluke soldier-slaves in Egypt. But those were in the service of the Turks,  and they were much too late in history to have been  &#8220;sold by Vikings&#8221;. Anything after the Crusades was post-Viking.  Nor were earlier Arabs likely to be buying (male) slaves from Vikings. They had little contact. It might have been white female slaves for Persian harems (but not male soldier/slaves), and the Turks came into the picture far too late.  I don&rsquo;t see the Vikings as being anywhere in this picture. Those Mamelukes were certainly not sold by Vikings.</p>

<p>How many times do I need to explain this?  I never said arabs were white.  I said they were caucasian.  I am not going to explain the differences between &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;caucasian&#8221; again.  Please stop using these terms interchangeably because they are NOT the same thing at all.  </p>
<p>And there you go again with the mulatto stuff.  How do you know that all of them are mulatto?  Perhaps some are.  Most of them, however, don&rsquo;t look like they have any black in them at all.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the ignorance level on here.  I guess a lot of people on this website believe that just because there is a group of caucasians who are tan-skinned and low IQed, they must have black in them.  Do you realize how ignorant that sounds?<br/>

		<p>Excuse the irreverence, but if the word huri, usually interpreted as virgins, really means pure white grapes, then it seems to me that if the Koran is truly the word of God, He ought to have been a better writer who could have made Himself more clear, rather than writing in conundrums and leaving His puzzled followers in confusion.  Surely God could do better!</p>

<p>Disagree, actually most Arabs appear like what they are, Semite/Caucasian. Neither their facial features, nor their hair type is reflective of African ancestry. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this guy was talking about &ldquo;race&rdquo;. There are obviously Arabs who are quite pale in places like Lebanon and those who are quite black in places like Sudan. </p>
<p>Although many Sudanese, namely the Janjaweed consider themselves Arab, racially most of them are simply Arabizied Africans, with only trace amounts of Arab ancestry. The majority of them are Black African, and not even the same race, much less skin color, of the average Lebanese. </p>
<p>These are the Janjaweed of Sudan, and they clearly are black  </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is true that the Arabs, especially in North Africa, are extremely racist against blacks, and that they would make darn sure black male slaves they brought up from down south did not bed an Arab female&#8221;</p>
<p>Nontrivial percentages of Subsaharan y-chromosome hapoltypes have been found in many Arab populations, so apparently there they were not that vigilant in that regard. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Why do the people on here always insist that arabs are a product of whites mixing with blacks? Do you NOT understand that there is a hierarchy within the caucasian race that has always existed?</p>
<p>By your criteria we should believe that Amazon Indians and Polynesians came about after blacks intermixed with Northern Asians (Japanese people). Give me a break.</p>
<p>Just as Asians have hierarchies within their race in its pure form, so do caucasians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Southeast asians and pacific islanders are not pure mongoloid, they are hybridized with australoids</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve said it well. There&rsquo;s an awful lot of confusion about exactly who are &#8220;Arabs&#8221; (as well as whites, Caucasians, Moslems, etc&hellip;.)   &mdash;   as Courtney has pointed out repeatedly,all to no avail.</p>
<p>Many of the conquered peoples who eventually became &#8220;Arabized&#8221; consider themselves today to be &#8220;Arabs&#8221;   &mdash;    even if there is little or no genetic connection to Arabia or Araby. Few people (especially in the Third World) understand anything about genetics. For them, the question is usually <i><b>cultural  </b></i>rather than  <b><i>racial. </i></b> If you have adopted Arab culture and religion, and speak Arabic, then (to them) you are an &#8220;Arab&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s like a Jamaican claiming to be an Englishman.  Or a black inhabitant of  Martinique claiming to be French (which they do).</p>
<p>The question then is, do you mean an Arab CULTURALLY OR RACIALLY? (Likewise an Englishman, Frenchman, American, Yankee, etc.)&hellip;eg. anyone can be culturally &#8220;French&#8221;, but not racially.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, so meagre is the understanding of genetics and biology in Moslem parts of the world that (as I was reading lately) Ayatollah Khomeini&rsquo;s regime required revision of the teaching of basic biology in Iran. It had to be brought into line with the Koran!  Mendelian genetics tell us that a child receives exactly equal genetic parts from both parents, whereas the Koran says that the child is entirely the creation of the father, while the mother is merely the incubator of the child.  Thus, the child belongs to the father.</p>
<p>In this case, religion overruled science and Mohammed trumped Mendel. You can&rsquo;t disagree with the Koran, which is the holy Word of Allah. If science discovers otherwise, then the facts will have to yield. The Koran cannot be contradicted.</p>

		<p>Remember when the &#8220;crisis&#8221; in Sudan&rsquo;s Darfur region was trumpeted as genocide carried out against Sudan&rsquo;s Bantu population by the &#8220;Arab Jajaweed&#8221;, and their Chinese overlords? The way the media tried to portray it, the Janjaweed was comprised of white Arabs slaughtering Black Sudanese. Naturally, cries of &#8220;racism&#8221; filled the air.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to the Internet, a totally different reality emerged. It turns out, the Janjaweed militia is comprised of coal-black Bantus who speak Arabic. In other words, it&rsquo;s a Bantu -on - Bantu effort, NOT white Arabs slaughtering the Darfur Bantus. In fact, the president of Sudan is a coal-black Bantu who resembles a cross between Al Roker and ex-Newark NJ mayor Kenneth Gibson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise, that, once people began to see it as a black-on-black conflict, the sobbing for Darfur, has become somewhat muted, and Darfur dropped off the radar of importance, as a result.</p>
<p>What happened at Fenger H.S. in Chicago is what happened in so many other African Bantu countries. Only that was captured on video, and black people in the USA were left to do some soul-searching ONLY AFTER it made the Internet, and was seen internationally, from Albania to Japan.</p>
<p>The Internet is so beautiful.</p>

    Perhaps there is another way of looking at it.Of course, the Koran was received before the advent of modern science - and in particular the discovery of the spermatozoon - which was only discovered in the mid 17th century by microscopist Van Leeuwenhook.Although at meiosis both parents contribute an equal number of complementary chromosomes, perhaps the idea behind the Iranian biology is that the &#8216;animating principle&rsquo; or &#8216;life force&rsquo; if you will is contained in the motile spermatozoa of the father.<br/>

But surely an all-knowing Allah would have known all these things anyway.  He did not have to wait for the development of science.</p>
