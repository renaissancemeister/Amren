<h1>NYT Environment Reporter Floats Idea: Give Carbon Credits to Couples That Limit Themselves to One Child</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edwin Mora, CNS News, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Andrew Revkin, who reports on environmental issues for The New York Times, floated an idea last week for combating global warming: Give carbon credits to couples that limit themselves to having one child.</p>
<p>Revkin later told CNSNews.com that he was not endorsing the idea, just trying to provoke some thinking on the topic.</p>
<p>Revkin participated via Web camera in an Oct. 14 panel discussion on &#8220;Covering Climate: What&rsquo;s Population Got to Do With It&#8221; that was held at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.  The other participants on the panel were Dennis Dimick, executive editor of National Geographic, and Emily Douglas, web editor for The Nation magazine.</p>
<p>At the event, Revkin said: &#8220;Well, some of the people have recently proposed: Well, should there be carbon credits for a family planning program in Africa let&rsquo;s say? Should that be monetized as a part of something that, you know, if you, if you can measurably somehow divert fertility rate, say toward an accelerating decline in a place with a high fertility rate, shouldn&rsquo;t there be a carbon value to that?</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have even proposed recently, I can&rsquo;t remember if it&rsquo;s in the blog, but just think about this: Should  &mdash;  probably the single-most concrete and substantive thing an American, young American, could do to lower our carbon footprint is not turning off the lights or driving a Prius, it&rsquo;s having fewer kids, having fewer children,&#8221; said Revkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;So should there be, eventually you get, should you get credit  &mdash;  If we&rsquo;re going to become carbon-centric  &mdash;  for having a one-child family when you could have had two or three,&#8221; said Revkin. &#8220;And obviously it&rsquo;s just a thought experiment, but it raises some interesting questions about all this.&#8221;</p>
<p>When CNSNews.com later followed up with questions about his comments, Revkin responded in an e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t endorsing any of this, simply laying out the math and noting the reality that if one were serious about the population-climate intersection, it&rsquo;d be hard to avoid asking hard questions about USA population growth,&#8221; wrote Revkin.</p>
<p>In a Sept. 19, 2009 blog entry, &#8220;Are Condoms the Ultimate Green-Technology?&#8221; Revkin cited an August 2009 study by the London School of Economics that highlighted having fewer children as a solution to diminishing our carbon footprint.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;More children equal more carbon dioxide emissions,&#8221; blogged Revkin. &#8220;And recent research has resulted in renewed coverage of the notion that one of the cheapest ways to curb emissions in coming decades would be to provide access to birth control for tens of millions of women around the world who say they desire it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I recently raised the question of whether this means we&rsquo;ll soon see a market in baby-avoidance carbon credits similar to efforts to sell CO2 credits for avoiding deforestation,&#8221; he later added. &#8220;This is purely a thought experiment, not a proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concern about ones &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; is largely a white concern as with other environmental issues.</p>
<p>Andrew Revkin who&rsquo;s probably white himself, is obviously directing his cryptic message at other whites. You just have to read in between the lines.</p>
<p>Just imagine the stupid futillity of asking the average black or hispanic to &#8220;Please help us reduce our carbon footprint and stop global warming by having only one child&#8221; </p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t get hostile, most probably wouldn&rsquo;t know what the hell your talking about.</p>

		<p>Only naive, multicultural, liberal White women and men would get starry-eyed at such a ridiculous proposal as not having children just to get &#8220;carbon credits&#8221;.  The idea is so ridiculous and stupid that only White couples would fall for such nonsense, and I don&rsquo;t mean to put down my own race here, but I think this guy Revkin knows this.  Most of these people who come up with ideas like this know the weaknesses of Whites and the fact that ONLY Whites could actually fall for something like this.  Blacks, Hispanics, Orientals or any other group would NEVER sacrifice their own family for such lunacy.  This is just a clever way to appeal to Whites and ONLY Whites to not have children. Just another way eventually get rid of us so another group(&rsquo;s) can have hegemony.</p>

Ok, here&rsquo;s another idea.</p>
<p>Lets increase taxes for each child. Each additional child doubles the tax of the previous child. Maybe hispanics would have fewer children.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m being facetious. Hispanics, being a minority, would likely receive credits and wavers.</p>

		<p>This idea of global climate change has to be the biggest hoax in modern history.  Does Revkin actually believe that the majority of the country cares about &#8220;carbon credits&#8221; when people are just happy to be employed in this cratering economy.  I heard some dope on tv breathlessly emploring Obama to come up with some plan to combat this &#8220;global catastrophe&#8221; that will kill us all if nothing is done.  It&rsquo;s clear to me that this hoax is engineered to feed on white guilt.</p>

		<p>&#8220;a one child family&#8221;  There is another issue at stake here other than having Whites give demographic hegemony to other ethnic groups. It`s also about government control of the population. It came to me upon hearing that in China 95% of people have no brothers or sisters. The State is their sibling&hellip;What a perfect way to erase loyalty to the family above the government. It`s all about eliminating what I have coined, &#8220;the genetic Bonanza response&#8221;. No more Hoss or Adam riding to the rescue of Little Joe against the corrupt Sheriff. Alarming and disgusting!</p>

		<p>Hey I have an idea! Why not just limit immigration? I can&rsquo;t believe the disconnect in these liberals&rsquo; minds that they can actually suggest paying people to have less children, yet can&rsquo;t comprehend that immigration also increases the population and carbon footprint of the nation. And then they discuss Africa reducing it&rsquo;s population growth through carbon credits. How about we stop sending them money to reproduce? How hard is it to see this?</p>

		<p>Why not carbon tax credits to anyone who rats out an illegal alien and gets them deported?  When Africans and Hispanics get here, the first thing they do is start consuming, big time.  They go from wonderful small-carbon-footprint little brown native people to massive king-cab-gas-hog-guzzling, fast-food-wrapper-tossing, Evil American Consumers.</p>
<p>So to keep them down on the pueblo (or kraal) where they will not pollute-up the environment, we ought to expel each and every one.  And anyone that rats &#8216;em out should get a medal from Mother Gaia and her Environmental Police.</p>
<p>What on earth do the liberals thing is going to happen to carbon consumption if we let those buggers into America. </p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t coming here to eat beans and live on some macrobiotic rice commune in tee-pees with hippies, they are coming here to Live Large and consume, Consume, CONSUME!<br>

		<p>This is no less than the promotion of white genocide.   </p>
<p>How about promoting population control in the third world to reduce their footprint on our backs? </p>
<p>Take Ethiopia : in the early &rsquo;80s their population of about 36 million were suffering from famine and war, so we fed them.  Now there are already more than 78 million Ethiopians, soon to be 80 million.  Their population is expected to double again by 2050.   </p>
<p>This evil insanity is also idiotic.  It is white people who not only created but sustain the modern world.  Animosity towards whites is as stupid as being at sea and hating one&rsquo;s own boat.  </p>
<p>If we are all in one big boat, let Revkin and his ilk jump overboard if they wish, but for the sake of those of us who wish to survive, let us not allow them to destroy the boat and condemn the rest of us! </p>
<p>To Mr. Cooper : No, Japan is not part of the population &#8220;problem&#8221;.  They are also facing population decline.   </p>
<p>Perhaps population increase vs. decrease can be accurately mapped by the concept &#8220;Ice people / Sun people&#8221;, where we can see that Sun people populations everywhere are exploding ( including in all of the homelands of Ice people! ), while Ice people limit their own numbers and do all they can to support not only the Sun population, but subsidize their growth.    </p>
<p>It is suicidal insanity.  We should let others worry about their problems, and devote ourselves to solving our own, the most serious of which is our numbers - which is to say: our existence. </p>

<p>A family of Somalis, or Ethiopians, or Vietnamese, or Banglashis, or Salvadorans, or Arabs will increase their carbon footprint several times by moving to the colder United States or Europe.</p>

<p>Although some other parts of the world were mentioned, notice it&rsquo;s mainly &#8220;USA population growth&#8221; that Revkin is worried about. Also note the assumption that the main cause of USA population growth is the birthrate, rather than the immigration rate.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s at all informed must notice the deafening silence from environmentalists when it comes to the subject of immigration to the USA. The elephant in the room that everyone pretends not to notice. We&rsquo;ve got millions of illegals in this country, altering housing patterns, increasing sprawl, driving vehicles and consuming goods, and yet that&rsquo;s not supposed to have any effect on the environment! What&rsquo;s really important is whether or not we &#8220;buy green!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just more evidence that the modern environmental movement is not about &#8220;saving the earth&#8221; but is in reality anti-West, anti-capitalism and anti-white. It&rsquo;s a fraud, a sham and a prescription for anti-white genocide.</p>

<p>Poor people have a smaller carbon footprint than rich people. Have the rich give up their money for carbon credits.</p>
<p>Since having fewer people is good for global warming, stop people from coming to this country before you start passing out condoms to limit the natural increase of Americans. Give carbon credits to Mexicans that agree to stay in their own (polluted) country.</p>

		<p>overpopulation is killing the planet, and this has been obvious since around 1970.</p>
<p>as it happens, whites worldwide reached zero population growth run 1970, and have been in negative growth ever since.</p>
<p>whites can contribute to environmentalism in the number of ways, most importantly by supporting conservation efforts worldwide and reducing their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>whites should increase their birth rates slightly, everyone else should reduce there is drastically.</p>

		<p> Odd, isn&rsquo;t it, how when some big-domed liberal &#8220;thinker&#8221; suggests people having fewer children, he always means WHITE people, and usually in America? He ignores the consequences of a falling birth rate for societies with increasing numbers of elderly who must be provided for, of course. Who is going to pay into Social Security and Medicare, so that these seniors (now including me) aren&rsquo;t left destitute in their old age?</p>
<p> And if he wants birth rates reduced, the &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; angle aside (that&rsquo;s just an excuse to penalize the most successful), why not address his suggestion to Africa? Of the 20 nations in the world with the highest fertility rates (average number of children born per woman of child-bearing age), 14 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Seems to me like you address the problem where it is the most severe   &mdash;   assuming that you believe families with more than one child are &#8220;a problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The whole thing is a joke, Global Warming or no Global Warming.  The White birthrate is in the negative in America.  If a population has 1.5 children for every 2 people or 1.5 million children for every 2 million parents, that population shrinks by 25% every generation.  A generation is only about 25 years.  I believe the White birthrate in America is 1.7 - 1.8, and that includes interracial births.  The White birthrate in Italy is 1.4 for every 2.0 people.   </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one country in the world where the White birthrate is in the positive.  There are certain regions within countries where it&rsquo;s positive or close to replacement, places in Russia, people like the Amish in America.  There is no White population as a whole that is even maintaining it&rsquo;s numbers as they exist today, let alone growing.    </p>
<p>If these green gurus were really interested in helping the environment, why wouldn&rsquo;t they be willing to have the intellectual honesty to tell the truth about this issue?  The truth that analyzing America&rsquo;s birthrate without taking race into account, is like looking at the issue with a blindfold on and both hands tied behind your back.  </p>
<p>The populations being imported into America and European countries often have positive birthrates, sometimes 3.0 or 4.0 or 5.0 children for every 2.0 people.  These populations DOUBLE every 25 years, or they TRIPLE every 25 years.  Our populations shrink every 25 years, yet this message of having no children is being marketed at those who are already having the fewest.</p>
<p>These green gurus are not really interested in helping the environment, because they&rsquo;re too disingenuous to even look at the issue as it truly is.  Their true agenda is an Anti-White agenda and an agenda of political correctness.  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m no longer a Liberal, I will not waste my time associating with people who can&rsquo;t even be honest enough to say 2 + 2 = 4.  </p>

<p>If for example the people who believe in the subjugation of women have the greatest number of children, then the next generation will have a greater number of people who believe in the subjugation of women.  If the people who believe in Islam have a greater number of children than those who are Atheists, then the world will become more religious and more Islamic.  If the people who have no compunction about throwing trash into the streets and cutting down forests and drilling in wildlife preserves have all the children, then that behavior will only increase going forward.  By not having children, you&rsquo;re committing your own ideology to it&rsquo;s grave.  <br>

I do agree with you. But I see it a little less drastically.  I don&rsquo;t beleive they really want us &#8220;gone&#8221;   &mdash;    not completely gone.   Just reduced,  just diluted.  They obviously think there are too many of us. Too many whites in one place make them nervous.   </p>
<p>But in the long run, they also need whites   &mdash;    at least some, just enough to get the work done, hold things together,  and keep them protected.  So whites are still necessary.  Some,  but not too many.</p>

Revkin and his &#8220;group&#8221; have an agenda where we&rsquo;re concerned.  It&rsquo;s not just the self-hating Whites either, it&rsquo;s the Whites who have been brainwashed into believing they&rsquo;re helping humanity by not procreating, and that it&rsquo;s &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;wonderful&#8221; NOT to have children.  They need an Awakening.  If we all just communicate to other Whites what&rsquo;s really going on, a major Awakening is possible.</p>

<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve looked behind me a bazillion times while walking and have yet to see a &#8216;carbon footprint&rsquo;. What a load of hooey.</p>
<p>The reason for America&rsquo;s population growth is not American births. Instead, it is due to America&rsquo;s obscene and absurd immigration policy. It is a distinctly twisted statistic.</p>

		<p>Peter K (#7) and others are right - what reason have leftists to expect our belief in global warming and population control WHEN THEY WON&rsquo;T CONTROL OUR BORDERS!!?</p>
<p>Seriously, folks. What was the last big alleged environemntal danger? Overpopulation! But now that the population growth has shifted from conservative whites to third world liberals they&rsquo;re glad to have it.</p>
<p>Really - if you believe that overpopulation is a problem while immigration is not then I have a few bridges to sell you.</p>
<p><b>Then the Meathead will want to open the door further to immigration from third world countries because we ned more workers. He is an idiot as is all of his liberal friends.</b></p>
<p>No, I think he knows what he&rsquo;s doing. It isn&rsquo;t right to assume someone&rsquo;s stupid, so you have to assume he&rsquo;s evil.<br>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8221;..&rsquo;.the single-most concrete and substantive thing an American, young American, could do to lower our carbon footprint is&hellip; having fewer kids, having fewer children,&rsquo; said Revkin.</p>
<p>He means fewer White children, of course.  This is one more attempt to justify why Whites and only Whites should reduce their numbers.  He picks up where paul  ehrlich&rsquo;s discredited &#8216;The Population Bomb&rsquo;  &mdash;  also a call for Whites, and only Whites, to reduce their numbers  &mdash;  leaves off.</p>
<p>Ehrlich was considered a deep thinker, a social visionary and a &#8216;guru&rsquo; in the 70s.  I remember being assigned to read his fraudulent book once in high school and twice in college.  In one of the college classes, the entire course revolved around the &#8216;merits&rsquo; of this specious book.  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear from my college freshman daughter that she has been assigned to read &#8216;The Population Bomb&rsquo;  &mdash;  in fact, I would be more surprised if professors at Berkeley didn&rsquo;t assign this book.</p>
<p>Jaames Quinn writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;At Earth Day I in 1970, biologist Paul Ehrlich promised a &#8216;Population Bomb&rsquo; that would kill as many as a half a billion people in the next ten or so years&hellip;In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death due to mass famine.  Ehrlich&rsquo;s book was eventually discredited and is so scientifically flawed that it&rsquo;s laughable, but keep in mind that, in 1977, Ehrlich was still being hailed as a science guru, and &#8216;The Population Bomb&rsquo; was a big influence on public policy&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Carbon credits&#8221; are a form of payment only educated Whites would accept.  The racial targeting is as obvious as if they offered payment in Rupees to entice Hindus, or Cadillacs with 20 inch wheels and spinners to draw in Blacks.  </p>
