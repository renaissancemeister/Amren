<h1>Terror Struck Four Generations in Deadly Home Invasion</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Tuft, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 6, 1009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A murder victim in a home invasion had just gotten out of the hospital when she was dragged by her hair, at gunpoint, through the house to wake up family members and show the robbers where the family&rsquo;s treasures were hidden, her uncle told the Post-Dispatch today.</p>
<p>One of the friends in the home was an off-duty policewoman, who didn&rsquo;t have her gun. But when the two gunmen tried to herd the entire family into the basement of the home on Hickory Street, the policewoman fought back. In that struggle, the gunmen started firing. That&rsquo;s when Gina Stallis, 34, was shot and killed. The cop and firefighter were seriously hurt by gunfire, and a teenage robber was shot in the hand.</p>
<p>While the struggle continued, Stallis&rsquo; mother, Rose Whitrock, ran out of the house and tried to get a neighbor to help but no one would, said Mark Whitrock, 50, of Wentzville, Stallis&rsquo; uncle. A neighbor woman came to her door, but refused to let Stallis&rsquo; mother use a phone to call police, Whitrock said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police officer, 27, who is not being identified by police, is in critical condition at a local hospital with multiple gunshot wounds. Her boyfriend, a 29-year-old firefighter, is in stable condition at a hospital from a gunshot wound to the neck.</p>
<p>Because the family members were able to give police such a vivid description of the men, police quickly arrested the two suspects. The 16-year-old boy was arrested after being treated at a hospital for a gunshot wound to his hand. His alleged accomplice was arrested in a car minutes later. Inside the car police found loot from the home where Stallis was killed, in the 900 block of Hickory Street.</p>
<p>The older suspect  &mdash;  Mario Coleman, 22, of the 5300 block of Cabanne Avenue  &mdash;  was charged Monday night with 12 felonies, including the murder of Stallis. He&rsquo;s being held in jail on a $1 million, cash-only bail. The 16-year-old boy is in juvenile custody. Police won&rsquo;t release his name unless he is charged as an adult.</p>
<p>Court records indicate that Coleman pleaded guilty to felony burglary and felony theft in 2007, but got a suspended imposition of sentence and placed on probation for three years. In 2008, court records indicate, Coleman pleaded guilty to a felony unlawful use of a weapon charge and, again, got a suspended execution of sentence and was placed on supervised probation. He got out of a &#8220;shock incarceration&#8221; ordered by a judge on April 11.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whitrock said that the family had lived for &#8220;years and years&#8221; in the three-story house because they were very involved in the St. Raymond&rsquo;s Maronite Cathedral across the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose&rsquo;s mother is the treasurer at St. Raymond&rsquo;s,&#8221; Whitrock said. &#8220;Their church is their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitrock says he thinks he knows why the family was targeted. &#8220;They have a very nice home and I think they are one of the only white families on that block,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Whitrock said there had been other problems with criminals at the Hickory Street family home. He said his brother, Stallis&rsquo; father, had parked a brand-new car out front a few years ago and someone lit a rag that had been put into the gas tank to try to blow it up. Stallis&rsquo; father died about two years ago.</p>
<p>Whitrock said his family is shaken by Monday&rsquo;s deadly attack.</p>

		<p>What jumped out at me was that Coleman had numerous successive Suspended Impositions of Sentences (SIS) on his rap sheet.  I thought it was insane that a justice system, even one as lenient and pro-black as St. Louis City, would punish an SIS violation with another SIS.  I floated it over at St. Louis Cop Talk, and they are indeed doing just that.</p>
<p>A tragic loophole in Missouri&rsquo;s law means that SISes, even when one is &#8220;serving&#8221; the time of the SIS, even if it&rsquo;s for a felony, does not show up on your rap sheet.</p>

<p>Blacks often complain the justice system is biased against them and cite the number of blacks that are incarcerated as proof.</p>
<p>The sad reality is, however, the opposite.  Many blacks are let out on parole because the system is overwhelmed and because liberal judges never seem to learn.  Liberal judges can&rsquo;t wait to hand out a light sentences to demonstrate their suppossed enlightenment and compassion. The rest of us pay the price of this idiocy.</p>

		<p>This could have been prevented.  All they had to do was look around the neighborhood and accept the FACT it was a hostile zone.  I can&rsquo;t help wondering what blinded them.  Their devotion to a church?  I also wonder if the &#8220;neighbor&#8221; who refused to call the cops can be held liable?<br>

		<p>It is very dangerous to live near Africans   &mdash;   even Africans know this.  These White people should have moved away years ago.  I guess their love for their local church made them stay in that particular area.  I wonder also if they were fooled by the media into believing that &#8220;Diversity is Our Greatest Strength&#8221; and that &#8220;We are all the Same.&#8221;  I suspect that their children won&rsquo;t fall for the same lies. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ordinarily not a hostile zone per se.  It was sort of a white working class are that luckily avoided the black influx.  Therefore, when yuppie gentrification of St. Louis City started, that neighborhood all of a sudden became desirable, like a few others in St. Louis City.  However, that neighborhood isn&rsquo;t far from where some high rise projects used to be, replaced in the last decade by low-rise projects.</p>
<p>The suspect didn&rsquo;t live anywhere near that neighborhood, anyway.  He swooped in from the long established ghetto part of the city, the northern half.</p>

<p>I wonder how white racism can be blamed. I suppose it can all be traced to segregated neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A black man I work with was walking home this summer in broad daylight when he was attacked, beaten, and robbed by two black men. He ran to the nearest house and banged on the window for help because no one who witnessed the attacked did anything.</p>

		<p>What a horrible story. But what on Earth was this family doing living in an all black neighborhood? They sound like decent, middle-class people. I imagine they&rsquo;ve been living in this neighborhood for decades, when it used to be white and safe. But at some point white families such as this need to wake up and smell the afro-sheen and get the heck out. And the police officer didn&rsquo;t have her gun? In an all black &#8216;hood?! I noticed the follow-up story said it was a &#8220;crime of opportunity&#8221;  They were targeted. Oh, but it&rsquo;s never a hate crime when the haters are non-white. </p>

		<p>This was a terrible crime and my heart goes out for the loved ones of Ms. Stallis. I am also sickened by the brutal burning of young Michael Brewer in Florida. He was set on fire by 5 youths ages 13-15. Please pray for his recovery and that justice will be served to the heartless thugs who committed this atrocity.</p>

		<p>I have very little compassion for whites who put themselves in these kind of situations by deliberately failing to notice how &#8220;dark&#8221; it is outside.  The laws of natural selection have a way of sorting out the idealistic and naive. God made man, Smith and Wesson made him equal.</p>

		<p>The only remaining White family in an all black &#8216;neighborhood.&rsquo; Is there really any justification for putting your children into such a situation? It should be considered child abuse to willingly raise children in such a hostile environment. Some people really are this delusional and believe in the tired propaganda of &#8220;equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to raise children in this type of neighborhood, at least teach them racial consciousness - although I&rsquo;m sure that the situation will do more to raise consciousness than anything.</p>

		<p>Something I just don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t understand is when you go to the comments section of these types of horrific and inhuman  stories of violence, murder, rape, child abuse, arson etc.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll always get the same crowd of liberal bleeding hearts who&rsquo;ll fight with all their might for the monsters leaving their empathy for the victims as a second thought.<br>
Why don&rsquo;t they understand that if you defend evil, you are evil too?<br>
They see the conservative reaction and fight that, but go no deeper. And them assume that we are the cold heartless ones. It&rsquo;s perplexing, as they are often clever people themselves.</p>
<p>For that burns victim boy link provided above by sbuffalo &#8216;an eye for an eye&rsquo; or a &#8216;do unto others&rsquo; type of punishment would be a satisfying end.<br>
No more, no less just the exact same treatment, receiving 80% burns (for a argument started over a video game.) <br>
Maybe hardline Sharia law is what some people require after all.<br>
Instead in this &#8216;he who casts the first stone&rsquo; World where the burns victim will get the life sentence and the perp gets a second chance to redeem themselves&hellip;..and a third chance and so on.</p>

<p>Sorry to sound like a broken record, but these &#8220;all black neighborhood&#8220;&#8216;s that you see mentioned here and elsewhere are the result of several decades of neglect.  In, say 1910, &#8220;all black neighborhoods&#8221; were only in the south.  Dixie.  St. Louis, like so many other US cities, had bleeding-heart naive leaders who encouraged what is now apparent as &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;  &mdash;  replace the poor white trash with super-cheap labor from the south  &mdash;  namely  &#8220;African Americans&#8221; (sic).  Etc., etc.</p>
<p>All this stuff is covered in the old pre-PC USA history books that you might could find in a library somewhere.</p>

		<p>What the authorities are not elaborating on is the fact some of these home invaders are shouting &#8220;police police&#8221; as they kick in your door. They think doing so gives them an advantage because citizens would be reluctant to fire upon them. And of course the police don&rsquo;t broadcast this fact for obvious reasons.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These White people should have moved away years ago&#8221;</p>
<p>I am really sick and tired of hearing European-American people making these cowardly statements!</p>
<p>I too live in a neighborhood dominated by people of color. Out of eight homes on this cul-de-sac,only three white families are left- with Africans, Asians and Mexican&rsquo;s outnumbering us.</p>
<p>The three of us have banded together and formed a mutual protection pact. We are all heavily armed and our properties are hardened with guard dogs, security lighting systems and digital cameras recording their every move in the cul-de-sac. Sure, the local cops are useless and hopeless&hellip;.but WE don&rsquo;t care, our security is up to US!</p>
<p>In fact, I will sit on my front porch in the evening, openly armed, sipping a Sam Adams with Fraulein Cara by my side. Whenever, she sees one of the diversity crowd wandering by flipping a gang sign, she jumps up and lets out  a monstrous growl and bark. You better believe it GETS their attention.</p>
<p>In fact, since we banded together and THEY obviously know it, crime is really non-existant for us.</p>
<p>If European-Americans have had enough of this diversity bullying, they need to grow a backbone and stop running.</p>

		<p>Home invasions are a near-commonplace occurence in Houston&rsquo;s suburbs. The perps, usually Blacks from Missouri City, targeting wealthy homeowners in the Sugarland area. The BEST defense is for homeowners to have loaded handguns hidden throughout their homes. </p>
<p>There are good hiding places where children won&rsquo;t think to look. While dialing 911 is the obvious first choice, having a gun or more for protection still can mean the difference between life and death. Calling 911 does not GUARANTEE instant response. 911 centers are usually staffed by city employees, with all the negative connotation &#8220;city employees&#8221; implies.</p>
<p>They have to provide ACCURATE info to police cars, which in turn have to make it to the victim&rsquo;s home in time to be of assistance. Thus common sense dictates you need to assume some responsibility for the safety of your loved ones and yourself. Having a handgun loaded and within reach is like car insurance. You hope you won&rsquo;t ever need it, but it is so comforting to know you have it.</p>

If only one of the victims could have accessed a firearm the results would have been far better.</p>

		<p>It is a good thing that cop fought back. Those folks were going to be massacred and all of them. When the villains begin to herd you into a basement or room as a group, then the intention is to kill all of you. Under that circumstance you MUST fight back, any way you can. Hard to do, yes, but otherwise you will be killed, all of you.  And the one villain took a round in the hand, it should be cut off as punishment.</p>
<p>And one of the &#8220;last&#8221; or nearly &#8220;last&#8221; whites left on the block. Well, that means they were deliberately targetted by &#8220;Coal Man&#8221;! The last white in a &#8220;neighborhood&#8221; runs a 100 % chance of being attacked. Just a fact!</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t necessarily fault this White family for too much, except that they weren&rsquo;t prepared to defend their home and family.</p>
<p>There are lots of good WHite people living in urban areas with large concentrations of poor African Americans. Many of us lead positive lives and are not victims of violent crime, because</p>
<p>We are prepared.</p>

<p>If you look around you can always find decent &#8220;colored folks&#8221; and it isn&rsquo;t selling out to just seek them out and treat them with respect that you don&rsquo;t give low life NW thugs.</p>
<p>Plus having some Blacks on your side helps in the media &#8220;blame game&#8221; after the &#8220;incident&#8221;.</p>
<p>I suggest you also take down any remotely racist flags - the US flag is good.</p>
<p>Play some loud Motown, Gospel Music along with classical and Classic country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good folks, not evil RACISTS&hellip;..</p>
<p>Well we are White Racists, but we&rsquo;re not evil and we are tough but fair with NWs, Blacks.</p>
<p>God bless Thomas Jackson and all those like him.</p>
<p>Can I come house sit sometime?<br>

		<p>My husband and I were thinking once of purchasing one of those old beautiful churches and turning it into a private residence. Unfortunately, every one we seriously considered was in what USED to be a working-class white neighborhood (and we weren&rsquo;t limited to one particular city or even a state) - it was like in the movie Gran Torino. </p>

<p>Lots of fun hobbies&hellip;.IDPA, IPSC, long-range tactical shooting competitions - home schooling my grand kids so they don&rsquo;t have to be dumbed-down and assaulted in the &#8220;rainbow&#8221; re-education camps  - working with my European American brothers in the cul-del-sac, keeps me too busy to lurk on the internet and take cheap shots.</p>

<p>Please accept my humble apologies for anything in my post that was taken by you to be sarcastic, a &#8220;cheap shot&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am 100% in support of you and the other White families on your cul-del-sac.</p>
<p>I was actually being honest when I said that it does sound like a bit of fun to sit heavily armed on a porch with a big dog at your side scoping on the street and watching the NW teens/thugs adjust their dress, walk, manners.</p>
<p>That does sound to me and many of us in places where we can&rsquo;t carry guns, it sounds like a fun hobby, in addition to of course being the right thing to do to protect your family and your neighbors.</p>
<p>God bless you and your family. Your White neighbors are very lucky to have such a noble man such as to lead them.</p>
<p>Take care kinsmen and again, please accept my humble apologies.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve felt the sting of St Louis&rsquo;s minority discount for criminals. </p>
<p>The car thief that ruined my valentines day a few years back was on SIS at the time he stole our car, and got involved in a high speed chase with it (hitting three others, and crashing into a pizza place). Even though he had a ton of stolen cars to his name, had more than 15 appearances before the court to face various charges, and was on his third consecutive SIS at the time (for yet other stolen cars)   &mdash;   in the middle of his trial his lawyer was able to broker a deal for him to get SIS again, with his SIS to run concurrent with his present SIS sentence. They basically tacked on a few months more SIS probation, and that was that. </p>
<p>In many ways the problem is not St Louis City police. The police did an outstanding job, recovering the car faster than you can get a pizza delivered. They had caught this guy numerous times, bringing him before the courts. The problem is that there isn&rsquo;t any room budgeted in the system for many of the less serious crimes, and phone-in probation isn&rsquo;t much of a consequence. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so gung-ho law &amp; order that I expect a first time car thief to actually get prison time, but I do expect there to be a limit somewhere to the number of less serious offenses you can commit without some type of meaningful consequence being applied. The criminals know the system is largely catch &amp; release for everything short of violent assaults, murder, and certain drug charges. It comes down randomly on a few unlucky people, but the hammer strike is very random. </p>
<p>The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.  At least we only paid with a stolen car, some money, time, and a ruined valentine&rsquo;s day. This lady had to pay with her life for it. </p>

		<p>Others have already commented on the fact that nobody present (including the policewoman) had a gun, but apparently nobody had a cell phone either!  Otherwise, why would Mrs. Whitrock have had to run out of the house to try (unsuccessfully) to borrow a telephone to call the police?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these people did well to handle the situation as well as they did under the circumstances.  Hopefully, the survivors and those reading about the incident will learn important lessons.  My condolences to Mrs. Stallis&rsquo; family.  And best wishes to the policewoman and her firefighter boyfriend.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;The three of us have banded together and formed a mutual protection pact. We are all heavily armed and our properties are hardened with guard dogs, security lighting systems and digital cameras recording their every move in the cul-de-sac&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I admire that you&rsquo;ve taken a stance to protect yourself, your loved ones and your animals with deadly force if need be.  I wish you lived in my neighborhood and I too would be happy to sit on that porch with you. </p>
<p>You might want to scatter a few skulls around in full view of the street  &mdash;  I have four  skulls, three gargoyles and a lot of fake human bones, hands, legs and feet, scattered permanently around my landscaping.  It has helped keep Third World dregs away and I&rsquo;ve seen them crossing the street away from my house.</p>
<p>What makes me irate is this is what we Whites have been driven to by a government that hates us!  We are increasingly being forced to hunker down behind fortress-like homes, armed, wary, guarded by police dogs, security systems and increasingly digital cameras.</p>
<p>This is how a lot of Whites are forced to live in California if they cannot afford to live in iron-gated communities or inside locked security buildings with &#8216;armed response.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My older neighbors speak of a time when there were no nine-foot retaining walls surrounding just about everyone&rsquo;s property, all the neighbors knew each other and their kids, block parties were held on the 4th of July, the local parks were clean, beautiful and safe, neighbors watched out for each other, homes were rarely locked up, there were no spotlights or cameras on top of people&rsquo;s fences, there were no snarling guard dogs needed for protection, kids played freely around the neighborhood until they were either called home for dinner or the sun went down and neighbors took pride in and supported the local schools.</p>
<p>As it is now, I barely know my neighbors even after 18-years of living in the same house, the neighborhood school is now fenced, gated and locked up and is 90% non-White (they are bused in from a local run-down apartment complex).  We have a loosely-knit neighborhood watch, but that is about it.</p>
<p>As California goes, so goes the nation so please heed what is happening in my once-glorious state  &mdash;  it is moving your way, rapidly.  As Jared Taylor has written:  We must make our neighborhoods as uncomfortable as possible for Non-Whites  &mdash;  but how do we do it?</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>As disturbing as this may sound to some,I have to say that if Caucasians are so complacent as to allow this level of anarchy,murder,rape(35,000 per year),robbery,assaults and general brutality by Blacks without reacting in a proactive manner such as massive deportations,then those amongst us deserve to perish.<br>
Natural selection will cull the weak,the overly trusting(unarmed cops at the home of a friend)and passive from our herd and in time we may have a stronger resolve when confronted with these huge levels of attacks against us by actually creating laws that will result in the removal of the offenders.</p>
