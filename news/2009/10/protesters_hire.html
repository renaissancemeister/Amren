<h1><a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/10/protesters_call.php">Protesters: Hire More Black Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas MacMillan, New Haven Independent (Connecticut), October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Passing by a school construction job site, Alan Felder saw a lot of Latinos at work. He didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Monday Felder returned to the school with former Mayor John Daniels  &mdash;  to lead a protest.</p>
<p>Felder led a group of a dozen men who picketed at 360 Columbus Ave. where the city is building a new home for the Roberto Clemente School.</p>
<p>Along with former Mayor Daniels, Felder called for more African-Americans to be employed on school construction projects throughout the city.</p>
<p>The problem is both &#8220;systemic and systematic,&#8221; Felder said, and represents &#8220;unfinished business&#8221; left over from the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>Felder also suggested that construction companies may be hiring undocumented immigrants, thereby &#8220;taking jobs away&#8221; from local black workers.</p>
<p>How did he know they may be undocumented?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t ask them when he passed by the site on Saturday, Oct. 10.</p>
<p>Rather, he looked through the fence and saw that the workers appeared to be all Latino, he said. &#8220;They could&rsquo;ve been undocumented. They look like they came from South America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unions rarely work on Saturdays, he said, so he thought to himself: &#8220;Wait a minute, something&rsquo;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>City spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said Monday that 35 percent of school construction workers citywide are black or Hispanic, which &#8220;exceeds requirements.&#8221; A check Monday at Clemente found 43 percent of the workers on that job were black or Hispanic. She said that the city will look into Felder&rsquo;s accusation that undocumented workers may be employed at Roberto Clemente.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Workers at the job site said on Monday that the workforce includes plenty of African-Americans.</p>
<p>Man Up</p>
<p>The city should be employing more local African-Americans in construction jobs, Felder said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a New Haven native and that&rsquo;s my complaint,&#8221; said Felder, who works as a plumber. If the city is hiring &#8220;newly arrived immigrants&#8221; rather than local blacks, &#8220;something is fundamentally wrong with that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is immigration economics,&#8221; Felder said. &#8220;Native borns, particularly blacks, can&rsquo;t get employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felder said that the Project Labor Agreement (PLA) signed by all unions working on city school construction allows contractors to avoid hiring blacks. &#8220;For us it&rsquo;s a Preference Labor Agreement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hope Wiggins, a monitor with New Haven&rsquo;s Commission on Equal Opportunities (CEO), showed up at Monday&rsquo;s protest, to rebut the charges.</p>
<p>She explained the requirements of the PLA. School construction workforces must comprise 25 percent racial minorities, 25 New Haven residents, 6.9 percent women, and 15 percent apprentices, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>(City Hall&rsquo;s statistics, based on the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2008 American Community Survey, shows the black population at 38 percent and Hispanic at 26 percent.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The under-employment of African-Americans in constructions projects is a citywide problem, particularly at Yale University, Daniels said.</p>
<p>Felder argued that having an umbrella &#8220;minority&#8221; category is deceptive. There should be separate requirements for black employment, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Let&rsquo;s look at the mathematics here,&#8221; Felder said. &#8220;My main concern is that our black babies are dying.&#8221; The black unemployment rate in New Haven is 35 percent, more than double the national rate of 15 percent, he said. &#8220;My belief is that our priorities need to be reset and readjusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Felder said he wanted to see minority workforce statistics separated by race. &#8220;We&rsquo;re asking them to break it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contacted later by phone, city spokesperson Mayorga said African-Americans and Latinos comprise 35 percent of construction workers on school sites, she said. The city doesn&rsquo;t have a breakdown of Latinos versus African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does exceed the requirement,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have a very diverse group of workers on these projects.&#8221;</p>

<p>How laughable, how utterly laughable!</p>
<p>Good old Comrade Felder there above, demonstrates exactly why blacks have always been, and always will deserve to be on the very bottom (or even subterranean) tier of any society they infect with their &ldquo;enrichments.&rdquo; I honestly wonder, how many times this wretched fool Comrade Felder has cheered on and reveled in the assumption that whites will &ldquo;inevitably&rdquo; become &ldquo;just another&rdquo; American minority in the near future? I wonder how often he subsequently fantasized in his abysmally Afrocentric ignorance, that he would be able to &ldquo;payback wicked old whitey?&rdquo; Just how often has he lapsed into a Kentucky Fried and Colt 45 induced stupor, and hatefully hallucinated that whites would all be his slaves in a country mystically transformed from 12% black to 120% black?</p>
<p>And then unfortunately, this horribly cold and bitter thing called reality, had to jolt him into lucidity in year one of the magical &ldquo;Obama Era&rdquo; 2009.</p>
<p>Again, how utterly laughable!!!</p>

		<p>I watched a news segment about this, based in Maryland. A contractor (a black man) originally wanted to only hiring Americans so he did-all white and black workers. Most if not all the blacks had attendance and punctuality issues so he let them go and most of the whites found jobs with better working conditions. In the end he had to hire Hispanics, because they worked hard and never complained. </p>

		<p>&#8220;43 percent of the workers on that job were black or Hispanic&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reporter uses this phrase twice. One wonder&rsquo;s if this is some kind of reactionary defense of the establishment. Is he an underground AmRener? But the reporter is probably really trying to make blacks out to be, of all things, victims. Not doing all you can to make blacks out to be victims being practically the definition of &#8216;hate&rsquo; nowadays, so perhaps this convolution is no surprise. </p>

<p>blacks reproduce at a very young age and their babies mature very quicky&hellip; such that a high infant mortality is quite normal for blacks. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s one time where I am all for the Hispanics (though most Hispanics in New Haven - I grew up there - are Puerto Ricans and not illegals).</p>
<p>Since the immigration debate appears over, it is good that diversity and mutliculturalism are coming back to bite blacks.</p>

		<p>How many of those construction workers were white?  Probably not nearly enough to match their proportion of the population.  Why is it imperative that more blacks work in construction and not more whites?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest Mr. Felder read the recent Amren article on federal jobs showing how blacks are wildly overrepresented:</p>

		<p>Who is Alan Felder that the world should conform to his wishes?  Were the blacks complaining before he got them roused up?  I&rsquo;ll bet not.  Is Alan Felder a concerned citizen or an agitator?  I am in the construction business and have been for 25 years.  I can tell you now that I have only seen 2 black workers EVER that had a work ethic.  Hispanics always outperform blacks when it comes to actual production.  School aren&rsquo;t built by shuckin&rsquo; and jivin&rsquo;.  Again I ask&hellip; WHO IS ALAN FELDER???</p>

		<p>But I thought that was what the blacks who were marching in the streets along with their Hispanic &#8220;brethren&#8221; wanted; to be together in the fight against white oppression.  Well, now they can be lumped together, as &#8220;minorities&#8221;.  Sometimes you just get what you wished for.<br>
As for Alan Felder, plumber, why wasn&rsquo;t HE on some job site that day, instead of being a busybody at someone else&rsquo;s worksite?  He&rsquo;s probably been skulking around that site, because they wouldn&rsquo;t hire him.  Well, no money in it for him this time.</p>

<p>Those same government figures have been used to show whites are, in some cases, vastly underrepresented. Wonder if whites are underrepresented at Historically black colleges and at Majority black colleges, being both do all they can to recruit blacks? Then white students at other colleges (and probably at these colleges too) have to endure sensitive &#8216;education&rsquo; about how there are not enough minorities at their school, not to mention efforts by everyone involved to recruit these underrepresented minorities too.  </p>

<p>Sure, they&rsquo;re here illegally and are trying to get as much money as they can and will do anything. Also, employers can get away with more things with illegals such as making them work longer in order to keep the job, put up with bad conditions etc.. Do you honestly think illegal hispanics will want to work 12 hours a day if amnesty is given and they&rsquo;re now &#8220;legal&#8221;? No way, they&rsquo;ll very soon start complaining and demanding shorter work hours, better conditions etc. Then we&rsquo;ll be stuck with a HUGE underclass and then the employers will want more illegals who won&rsquo;t complain and so on.</p>

		<p>Anybody who has worked in the construction industry for a while knows that most blacks are worthless. I&rsquo;m a white woman, and what I saw in terms of black behavior was sometimes unbelievable. Most of them would&rsquo;nt or could&rsquo;nt come on time.  Then they acted as if their prescence was doing everyone a big favor.  As for actually giving their contractor an honest eight hours work, well forget it.  I saw this pattern of behavior over and over again.  Then black men are puzzled why contractors prefer Mexicans and whites.  </p>
