<h1>Nobel Committee Drops a Bomb</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> October 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world&rsquo;s attention and given its people hope for a better future,&#8221; said Thorbjoern Jaglan, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee when he announced that Barack Obama was to be this year&rsquo;s Peace Prize winner.</p>
<p>To their credit, most Americans, even Democrats, were astonished. Americans are not quite so hypnotized as they once were by one of the greatest hot-air salesmen of our time. In his own country, Mr. Obama is beginning to look more and more like a one-termer, but the Europeans appear still to be bewitched.</p>
<p>This award makes sense only when  &mdash;  with an enormous effort  &mdash;  we recall just how giddy nearly the entire world was back in January at the time of the inauguration. &#8220;He&rsquo;s like Gandhi or something,&#8221; gushed actor Alan Cumming. &#8220;He&rsquo;s got that powerful, soulful thing in him.&#8221; Actress Susan Sarandon was just as thrilled: &#8220;He is a community organizer like Jesus was. And now, we&rsquo;re a community and he can organize us.&#8221; CNN hawked inauguration T-shirts it called &#8220;some of the most historic shirts money can buy.&#8221; One read: &#8220;Obama raises hand, lifts a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks were beside themselves. PBS commentator John Ridley explained that &#8220;Obama is the more perfect union. He is a house united.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [J]ust by virtue of his being, Obama is America, and the first true American to lead our nation.&#8221; Maya Angelou told us: &#8220;We needed him. And out of that great need Barack Obama came.&#8221; Even before Mr. Obama had served a single day in office, New York Congressman Jose Serrano introduced a bill to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution, which limits the president to two terms.</p>
<p>Most Americans forget that, if anything, foreigners lost their bearings even more than Americans. &#8220;We have great hopes that we are standing at the dawn of a new era,&#8221; wrote the Norwegian daily <cite>Aftenposten.</cite> &#8220;One Giant Step for Mankind&#8221; read the front page of England&rsquo;s <cite>Sun</cite> newspaper. A headline on the London <cite>Telegraph</cite> website declared: &#8220;Barack Obama Victory Allows Britain to Love US Again.&#8221; The <cite>Times of London</cite> headlined its election story, &#8220;The New World.&#8221; <cite>Le Monde</cite> in Paris noted that &#8220;from Left to Right, [French] politicians have been competing for superlatives with which to praise the election of Barack Obama.&#8221; Milan&rsquo;s <cite>Corriere della Sera</cite> wrote that Mr. Obama was &#8220;the man who can save America from utter breakdown.&#8221; The Nobel Committee no doubt believes that through his election, America has transcended its &#8220;racist&#8221; past, and this gives hope to the world.</p>
<p>The difference seems to be that Americans now look back a little sheepishly at all that idolatry. The Norwegians, apparently, have not yet sobered up from their inauguration party.</p>
<p>If Mr. Obama had sensible advisors they would tell him it is unseemly for a man who has done nothing to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, but even if he had sensible advisors, Mr. Obama would accept anyway. All his life, glory and adulation have been handed to him without much effort. Why not the Nobel Peace Prize? He would accept if he had won it for literature on account of his ghost-written autobiographies (after all, he did accept Grammy awards for the audio recordings of each one), and probably half expects the College of Cardinals to ask him to take over when Pope Benedict dies.</p>
<p>Surely, there has never been a time when it was so glorious to be black, and there will be much sport in seeing who actually believes or pretends to believe that The Empty Suit deserved the prize. The next few days will see an edifying winnowing of the fawners, dreamers, and incorrigible race men from those who still have some grasp of reality.<br>

		<p>The elite in Europe are such utterly sickening far leftists. They haven&rsquo;t got the slightest clue, and probably couldn&rsquo;t care less, how stupid Americans think this decision was. Last I read, some 75% of Americans believe he didn&rsquo;t deserve it.</p>

		<p>Somebody has to be pea green with jealousy right now.  After all, this somebody spent most of his second term as President implementing cynical foreign policy in a cynical way only to angle for the Nobel Peace Prize so that he can have a non-Lewinsky legacy.  That somebody&rsquo;s name?  Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Now I think I know why President Obama was sitting on major decisions on Afghanistan.  I think he knew he was up for the NPP.  I think the blood of American soldiers that have died in Afg. since he has been President is on his hands.</p>
<p>Obama supposedly got this NPP because he gave the world hope.  If that&rsquo;s the case, then David Axelrod should have gotten the NPP.  After all, Axelrod&rsquo;s scam was that he wrote a speech with &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;change&rdquo; as every other world, and every two years he finds some sucker to read it in public.  John Edwards in 2004, Deval Patrick in 2006, and of course Obama last year.</p>
<p>Just remember, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad drops a nuclear bomb on New York City and an EMP on the Silicon Valley, remember that President Obama got a Nobel Peace Prize because of his calls for hope and diplomacy.</p>
<p>Also, I think it&rsquo;s another example of affirmative action.  He admitted to doping it up and slacking it off during his last two years of high school.  So (1) How was he able to graduate from Punahou, a very prestigious private high school, and (2) Get admitted into Oxy with that bad record?  Then he slacked off at Oxy, and somehow was able to transfer to an ivy league school, Columbia, and somehow he did well enough there to graduate.  But not well enough such that he should have been admitted to Harvard Law, but he was anyway.<br>

		<p>Jared Taylor argues that Obama looks like a one term president. I am not so sure I agree with this. There seems to be alot of parallels to Clinton. Secondly, by winning the Nobel Peace Prize, this will probably cause the media and others to give him more leeway than they already have. </p>
<p>Sad, but probably true.</p>

		<p>Is this not right out of a screenplay?  Is he not straight out of central casting? He was afterall, backed by the Hollywood elite and their money, so doesn&rsquo;t it make you wonder?  Who is really behind all this and who conjoured up this character?</p>
<p>Here is a man who didn&rsquo;t have the experience of running a lemonade stand, who&rsquo;s only accomplishments are in radical academia, with radical associates, and a dubious, mysterious background whereby he doesn&rsquo;t even have true American upbringing.</p>
<p>But boy can he charm the foolish masses. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this Hollywood movie plays out and there better not be a sequel.  We simply can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>

		<p>Obama has been the beneficiary of affirmative action programs for his entire life. Nobody can seriously believe that he merited admission to Columbia or Harvard. Had he been white, he would never have been given an opportunity to teach at the University of Chicago (he declined a full-time faculty employment opportunity because he probably knew that he was not up to faking it with a full course load of classes). </p>
<p>I am surprised that Obama claims that he will donate the Nobel Prize money to charity. Like most leftists, Obama is free with other people&rsquo;s money, but tight with his own. Let&rsquo;s see if he makes good on his promise. </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor, as is expected, has delivered an outstanding critique of this beneath absurd nonsense. It is so laughable that this freakish fool, this totem to multiculturalism&rsquo;s abject genocidal degeneracy, has gotten this &ldquo;prize&rdquo; that most are left running to a restroom, simply to avoid soiling themselves in their unrestrained mirth. The even greater joke being, as Mr. Taylor points out above, that the shameless interloper will fly to Oslo and personally accept this thing. With the telegraphed punch line being that while he is yet again wasting the American taxpayers&rsquo; money to do so, a potential nuclear disaster to world peace is brewing up in Iran, like some maniacal curse from the three witches in Macbeth. </p>
<p>Indeed: &ldquo;By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes; Open, locks, whoever knocks!&rdquo;<br>

As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>I think Obama was awarded this prize, as a boost for his domestic struggles by a European Nobel committee. Europe is horrified that its favorite poster boy for multiculturalism is experiencing dissent at home, and so gave him the prize as a balm to soothe his aches. It can also be thought of as a &#8220;consolation prize&#8221; for Chicago not getting the 2016 Summer Olympics. It won&rsquo;t mean much here, like the Peace Prize won by that Burmese dissident, Aun Suu (sp.) made no impression on the Burmese junta that still has her under house arrest.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize is easily the most political of all the Nobel Prizes, with the Literature award being second. In actuality, the Nobel Peace Prize for Obama is no different than Times &#8220;Person of the Year Award&#8221;, or the &#8220;People&rsquo;s Choice &#8221; award. Hey, Yassir Arafat won a Nobel Prize, as have the U.N. peacekeeping forces, many of whom have committed crimes like rape, against the people they&rsquo;re supposed to protect, so how prestigeous can it really be?</p>
<p>I expect Obama to get an even more swollen ego, but our enemies don&rsquo;t care whether he won the Prize or not. A potential problem I see is that all the gun control organizations like the Brady Bunch are going to urge Obama to go after our guns, and enact more draconian gun laws since he&rsquo;s now &#8220;a man of peace&#8221;. Just watch.</p>
<p>Ironic Obama gets the Peace Prize at a time when he&rsquo;s considering sending more troops into Afghanistan. Way to go, Nobel Prize Committee. </p>

		<p>Yes, the Great Winnowing &#8220;of the fawners, dreamers, and incorrigible race men from those who still have some grasp of reality&#8221; is upon us.</p>
<p>Is it not also a separation of the insane from the sane, the fantasyists from the artists, those who bend words from those who think words mean something, those who think they create reality from those who think reality just IS?</p>
<p>There is a place for fantasy, word-bending and dreaming, and I am not against them  &mdash;  but reality must be the foundation of all this possibility-thinking. It takes many knocks and setbacks to even be able to see reality correctly. </p>
<p>Obama does not see it.</p>

		<p>The Nobel Prize Committee wants to feel good about itself and give the award to Obama, but they can see his potential. They know that he will accomplish nothing of note in the next three and a fraction years, and will fail to be reelected. Then they would have NO reason whatsoever to give him the award. Now they can give it for &#8220;honorable intentions&#8221; and save a little bit of face. </p>

		<p>I can barely contain myself. Surely this is a joke? Perhaps another conspiracy gone bad?</p>
<p>What is so surprising about this? The West is so grossly incompetent even the White Ruling Elite no longer distinguish between potential and actually doing something.</p>
<p>Our whole society has shifted towards the &#8220;shuck and jive&#8221; mentality. TV, Hollywood, Art, Music, Advertising, News, school books, and Academia, are FULL of gross exaggerations and borderline lies. That is the New West. No credibility, no honor, no reasoning, but the opposite: deception, lies, overestimation of situations, feminine drama from men, etc.</p>
<p>And finally, the level of stupidity has reached such a point that the emperor can no longer hide the fact that THEY have no clothes.  </p>
<p>I am a little giddy over this. Show me a greater display of utter stupidity, incompetence, political correctness gone amok, and just plan old hero worship that has ever been displayed in the last 1000 years in the West. </p>
<p>Best Regards to those who are as elated as I am over this &#8220;revelation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I know the Amren commentariat is going to gloom-and-doom this one to death, but really, I think this is hilarious.  I think this is wonderful!  I was petrified at first, because I thought Obama was going to make lemonade by refusing, but that ship has already sailed since the White House has let it leak that he&rsquo;ll be flying to Norway to accept (now he&rsquo;ll look like a cynical politician if he comes to his senses and decides to decline).</p>
<p>This is definitely the shark-jumping moment for Obama.  Talk about a laughingstock!  Though I can&rsquo;t decide who this damages more, Obama or the Nobel committee (or whatever they call themselves), it&rsquo;s a toss-up at the moment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Obama gets every cover of <i>Time</i> until Ragnarok!</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very odd that he&rsquo;s accepting.  Until I read that the WH is basically saying that&rsquo;s the case, I (gloomily) assumed he&rsquo;d be canny enough to graciously decline.  But he (and apparently, all his close advisers) are so drunk on their own Kool-Aid that they&rsquo;ve parted ways with all sense of proportion, decorum, and even political savvy.  This is going to be a household joke for decades.</p>

		<p>Obama was awarded the Nobel prize by Whites.  Obama was elected by Whites.  Obama&rsquo;s biggest supporters in Hollywood are White.  Obama was given his education by Whites.  Obama was raised by Whites.  Obama&rsquo;s advisors are almost all White.  Obama&rsquo;s European hallelujah chorus is all White.  Obama seems somewhat embarrassed by the Nobel award.  White marxists are ecstatic.</p>
<p>Obama is a tool of White marxist rule, not black rule as is the case in certain African countries.  The White race is being destroyed by White marxists, not blacks, hispanics, or muslims.</p>
<p>In the future, if we are lucky, our Chinese masters will prefer us to blacks, mestizos, and violent muslims, and treat us decently.</p>

		<p>This will turn into a good thing. Public opinion is already being critical of the choice and even Obama seems embarrassed. However, it would be nice if the media, and liberals were honest by admitting this award was simply because he&rsquo;s the first black president. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still left wondering what the hell is wrong with the Norwegians and even Europeans as a whole for their unmitigated love for Obama. I knew it was bad but him winning the Nobel prize really puts things into perspective. Ironically, this might be the best gift the Conservatives could have hoped for.</p>

		<p>This situation is no joke.  These Norwegians are incredibly deluded and they&rsquo;re deluding themselves and the White world into the grave.  No matter how badly Obama performs no country and no mainstream media is going to criticize him.  </p>
<p>Actors and actresses are among the most deluded people on the face of the earth,ex. Susan Sarandon:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a community organizer like Jesus was. And now, we&rsquo;re a community and he can organize us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s comparing this guy with Jesus for God&rsquo;s sake!  Incredibly I fear when the depression comes it&rsquo;s going to get a lot worse.  This guy will be allowed to set up a police state and it will be viewed as an &#8220;act of God&#8221; by the media.</p>

		<p>Obama could blow his nose and would win the Nobel Prize!</p>
<p>To the adoring Scandinavians, the Obamamessiah can do no wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a shame how the Nobel Prize has been politicized. <br>
This award, established by a white man, a European, (and a capitalist at that),  is now used to support every left-wing, Marxist, anti-white cause in the world. They have turned  it into a political tool.  It has become a joke.</p>

		<p>The Nobel Committee should have given a joint prize to Obama and Mugabe. After all, both Obama and Mugabe represent the pushing of whites out of their formerly held positions, that whites are the cause of all of earth&rsquo;s problems, that whites stole everything they have from others, etc.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m still left wondering what the hell is wrong with the Norwegians and even Europeans as a whole for their unmitigated love for Obama. I knew it was bad but him winning the Nobel prize really puts things into perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite simple.  America is the only obstacle to the EU gaining economic dominance in the world.  Some people like to say it&rsquo;s China but pay attention to what&rsquo;s going on on the world stage.  Corruption in the Securities and Exchange Markets escalated the transition from New York to London as the world&rsquo;s financial capital. The European Union has already surpassed the US in GDP and that gap is widening.  The euro is gaining tremendous ground against the dollar and European leaders are quietly joining in a concerted effort with China, Russia and the Middle East to dump the dollar as the reserve currency of choice.  They flatter and fawn over Obama because he is seen as the perfect tool for the final destruction of America.  His massive social spending will ensure that those printing presses at the mint will be running 24/7 to meet all those financial obligations rendering the dollar worthless.        <br>

		<p>Honest to God, I thought it was a joke. Hearing they&rsquo;ve now handed him the Nobel Peace Prize truly sounded like a comedy skit poking fun at the adoration, the worship, heaped on him.<br>
 <br>
By exalting him yet more, near the beginning of his term (right after he tried and failed to score the Olympics for his Chicago cronies to cash in), whoever gave him this is interfering in our domestic affairs, on purpose. The free ride, blind eye, lie machine is just warming up! You ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I realize he&rsquo;ll probably be reelected. The MS media and Western Civilization-hating establishment will cover his tracks every step of the way, and the Republicans will put up another fall guy to throw the next election. Who or what is the hidden hand behind all this?</p>

		<p>I can think of a 100 people more deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize than Obama. People who have labored for decades to bring real peace without advocating the loss of freedom as Obama is doing right now with his efforts on limiting our freedom of expression with the United Nations. </p>
<p>But when you have a panel that considers Tookie a candidate and Arafat a recipient then I guess why not Obama instead of Mother Theresa. Or Chavez or Stalin. After all, they brought real peace to their respective nations in the same way by doing away with human rights and freedom. A fact that seems lost on this panel.</p>

		<p>I think Obama got the award for one of two reasons: 1) The committe is made up of far-leftists who wanted to give the award to a black guy, or 2) the Nobel committe is brilliantly trying to control our foreign policy.  Giving this award to a man like Obama with a mountain-sized ego and no foreign-policy experience is bound to push him towards adopting a foreign-policy in-line with what is expected of a Nobel Peace Prize winner regardless of the circumstances.</p>

<p>Our enemies are Obama and his handlers, his masters, his enablers. The utter gall of it all is amazing, but not all that surprising. There have been stories of increasing behind the scenes pressure on the Nobel committees in the sciences to hand out awards to certain types of people etc. They are no doubt true as the Literature and Peace Prizes have turned into an annual Marxist practical joke on the rest of the world.  </p>
<p>Obama underwent deification by the MSM after his (in)famous speech at the Democratic Convention in 2004. It&rsquo;s interesting Jared Taylor mentions BHO stepping in as the next pope. At work today, I was kidding with some of the aware folk, asking them when BHO would be canonized. </p>

		<p>This award was meant for all the things The Anointed One (Blessings and Peace be upon him) is going to do for us, since he only had 11 days in office before he was nominated for this award.  One of his anticipated accomplishments is to &#8220;ease tensions with the Muslin world&#8221;, as I learned from one of the gushing radio news broadcasts.  This immediately brought to mind his announcement that the USSA is no longer a Christian nation, followed soon after by an announcement that the USSA is one of the world&rsquo;s largest Muslin nations.</p>
<p>Now the MPAA will have to come up with a special Oscar for him (remember Hillary&rsquo;s Grammy for reading her book, &#8220;It Takes a Village Idiot?).  Something like Best Performance with a Teleprompter.</p>

The media will cheer it as replacing chaos with order, the churches will praise it as replacing &#8220;hate&#8221;  with love, and the Marxist academics will laud it as eliminating &#8220;racism&#8221; and replacing it with brotherhood.

		<p><i>&#8220;Obama is America, and the first <b>true American</b> to lead our nation.&rdquo; Maya Angelou told us&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So what does that mean? That only Black Americans can be the &#8216;real Americans?&rsquo;<br>
What does that make the likes of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Grant, Roosevelt, Johnson and Reagan? <br>
Interlopers or bench warmers for some guy who was raised in Hawii and Indonesia and who&rsquo;s father was a foreigner in both nationality and ideology.</p>
<p>The least they can do is re name America out of respect for those of you whose ancestors actually built the place, like to &#8216;The United Countries of Earth:Country no.16&rsquo;, &#8216;Ongo Bongo Land&rsquo; or &#8216;New Kenya&rsquo; or something.</p>
<p>I have similar feelings down this end of the World, where it feels like our Country(s) have been taken away from us, but I don&rsquo;t remember getting the memo for when it happened exactly? <br>
It feels like our greedy tax collecting focused Government(s) have worked out that they&rsquo;ve squeezed all the Blood and Taxes that they can out of their current low replacement level populous&rsquo;s, so they are going to keep bringing in all the new &#8216;contributors&rsquo; that they can from &#8216;who really cares where&rsquo;?<br>
While we&rsquo;re told daily to respect the culture&rsquo;s of these others,  when we&rsquo;re (indirectly) told ourselves that we have no collective culture, nor religion to protect anymore ourselves (or at least one that is worth protecting over revenue generation and collection.)<br>
And we&rsquo;re not allowed to be recognised as a group until it&rsquo;s time to offically discriminate against us, of course then they have no problem putting all of us Whites together.</p>
<p>And regarding this nomination, wow Hussien truly is a rock star.<br>
Talk about being born the right time, with the right skin color and the right parent and /or grandparents.<br>
What do they think? That 200 yrs(or whatever the current figure is?) of Black privilege is now required to balance things out. <br>
It seems Hussien&rsquo;s whole life has been one of &#8216;winning by default&rsquo;, the ever professional campaigner who has the right skin tones and bone structure, the quintessential &#8216;poster boy&rsquo; or perhaps he&rsquo;s just the (lucky)beneficiary manifestation of ugly White guilt personified.<br>
He must laugh himself to sleep at night knowing that the most of his success can be attributed to the collective guilt comming from a group of people who have done very little wrong themselves who yearn to pay back to a another overly sensitive and loud group who have endured very little themselves of the historical misdeeds that this debt has been attributed to.</p>
<p>Why is it when it comes to history, we get to bare the burden of the past and none of it&rsquo;s fruits?<br>
Frankly the whole World owes us a big &#8220;thank you&#8221;!<br>
Even now there are big teams of professional researchers working around the clock to cure Aids, Malaria, TB, Leprosy and every other form of death that we can think of so we can facilitate the multiplication of those who angrily aspire to one day replace us.<br>
This is odviousily the downward curve in the cycle of a/our civilisation. <br>
And through political correctness we Whites can and will only argue with ourselves about it, while the non White world can just sit back and watch us eliminate each other.<br>
At least, us so called evil self preserving Whites want a dialogue, it&rsquo;s the liberal Whites who are &#8216;the nation of cowards&rsquo; and who will only show their malice towards their own i.e. &#8216;us&rsquo;.<br>
I&rsquo;ve noticed many times being a &#8216;fly on the wall&rsquo; in any of the numerous Right/Left racial battles that occur online daily (the internet being the last real bastion of free speech), that after even the smartest and most well read Liberal has been bested in a debate, they&rsquo;ll go from &#8220;let&rsquo;s all be friends/ it&rsquo;s the spiritual,decent thing to do/ we&rsquo;re all humans&#8221; type of cliched rhetoric, that once bested and all is lost in frustration they&rsquo;ll often lash out with the more truthful &#8220;ha ha you&rsquo;re all going to be extinct within a 100 yrs/ all the White woman I know are with Blacks/ we are taking over&#8221; type of final gloat.<br>
And I think to myself, well that is why we must fight you, because you pretend to be all about Love, but really you wish to destroy us and that is not the deed of a loving friend.  <br>
After we Whites destroy each other I guess this is what the Bible meant by &#8216;the meek will inherit the Earth&rsquo;? It sure looks that way (we better leave some instruction manuals laying around.)<br>
Black rule (again) by default (or non White rule at least.)<br>
If we can be a group when being positively discriminated against, then we can be a group when trying to refind the strength that (odviousily) came and comes from our cohesion!<br>
It&rsquo;s just astounding how marginalized be have become over the last 60 yrs. <br>
If we can no longer can have a geographical nation with boarders and our own Government, we need to at least have a White nation in ideology.<br>
We need to unblacken our hearts (no pun) and lift ourselves from the insidious guilt which suffocates us so. <br>
We are here because we have heart, don&rsquo;t forget that. <br>
We are all capable of hate and guilt, we Whites don&rsquo;t have the exclusive on those negative and stifling emotions, but we who care do need to free our White brothers and sisters from those very diseases. <br>
And then from there, we can one day get some actual land under our feet that is truly ours again. <br>
Hopefully not too much travel is involved (hint, hint.) <br>

		<p>First, who exactly gave the Nobel people the right to decide for the world who gets the &#8220;Peace Price.&#8221; If not for the $1 million plus award and years of publicity, who cares? It reminds me of the Miss American pageant. Sadly, some of the pageant contestants seem more together than either the Nobel committee or Obama. If AmRen had $1.5 million laying around along with a bunch of extra tuxedos they could give the AmRen Peace Prize. Obama would probably show up to accept that (in the rather unlikely event of a win). </p>
<p>On the surface you would think that the NPP going to the president would be greeted almost universally with praise. The clear backlash at this moronic award, I believe, is coming from the growing number of Americans who seem to be saying &#8220;enough already.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Obama and his selfish handlers are running the nation into the ground. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s back to Europe for Barak so he can make another speech. Maybe he can stop in Kenya or wherever on the way home and pick up his birth certificate.</p>

We simply do not know what Obama will do with the rest of his presidency.He possibly might instigate an aggresive war. or be involved in some other sort of action in which his executive decision caused bloodshed.<br>
 - For this reason political leaders should only be give &#8216;peace prizes&rsquo; years after they&rsquo;ve left office and a sober assesment of their records and intentions can be made.</p>

<p>When I turned on my car radio Friday morning and heard the morning talk radio guy say that Obama had won the Nobel Peace Prize, I thought it was a joke  but as I listened for the next 30 minutes, I realized that it was actually true.  I asked myself what the hell did he win it for?  He hasn&rsquo;t done a damn thing.  Why was he elected, the same reason he won the prize?  Because it was the trendy thing to do and it was more of a anti-Bush award than anything else.  </p>

		<p>To Archie Bunker - Had Ronald Reagan been a democrat, he probably most certainly would have the shared the award with Mikhail Gorbachev.  Instead, because Mr. Reagan was a Republican, they gave the award for peace solely to Gorbachev.  And I&rsquo;m not saying that Mr. Gorbachev didn&rsquo;t deserve to win but everybody knows (except for my boss who is adamant that Jimmy Carter actually won the cold war and that Reagan slept through both terms in office), that Ronald Reagan deserved to share the prize with Mr. Gorbachev.

<p>He should use it to reimburse us taxpayers for the cost of his trip to pick up that prize.  Surely he&rsquo;ll have to fly Airforce One over there.  With the fuel costs, pilots salaries, and all of the extra security required surely he&rsquo;ll run up a tab of at least $1.4 million for this trip.  </p>
<p>So Barack:  Make out a check to the US Treasury for $1.4 million.</p>
<p>Better yet, he could have those idiots mail him the check and then he could contribute it to reduce the National Debt.  They say that the true amount of the National Debt is about $50 trillion, so this would reduce the National Debt to $49,999,998,600,000!!!!  Then if just 35,715,285 more people would contribute $1.4 million each our country would be out of debt.</p>
<p>Yes folks.  We really do live in unbelievable times.</p>

		<p>The biggest joke of all is that Alfred Nobel stipulated that Norway<br>
gets to award the prize because at the time Norway was under Swedish control. He felt that if Sweden were to have right to name the winners it might be politically motivated. Another fun fact about the peace prize. Anyone ever hear of the Bofor guns? That&rsquo;s what funds it. Bofor was owned by Nobel.</p>

		<p>As usual, Jared Taylor nails it. Rush, Hannity and the others complain that Obama getting the Nobel Prize is an example of political correctness. Some say this proves he is a socialist as the Norwegians that run these &#8220;awards&#8221; are socialist. Still others complain that the prizes favor Democrats over Republicans.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is Obama got the award for being black and making the whites who run these things feel good about themselves and their worldview.</p>

<p>Are you saying that Afghanistan is the wrong war?  My only beef with the war in Afghanistan is that we have let the Taliban rear their ugly vicious heads again because we won&rsquo;t let our military do what they need to do.  Bush may have been accused of being a warmonger but his hands were tied also and Obama is even worse.  His kind hate the military and his Nobel Prize was awarded because he&rsquo;s been kissing with the Arab world since he came into office.</p>

And how did that work out for South Vietnam? At least Le didn&rsquo;t accept the award, since he must have known the conquest of the South would continue. Kissinger, however, having obtained the &#8220;decent interval&#8221; the US needed to get out before the Fall of Saigon, did accept his half of the prize, as if they had really achieved peace.

		<p><i>Those of you who are arguing that this is bad news for Obama need to explain your arguments further. In all due respect, it does not make much sense to me. I cannot see how this is BAD NEWS for Obama in any way. It seems that you are in a state of denial.</i> </p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s bad news for Obama because he was conceited enough to accept.  Had he turned it down, he&rsquo;d have shown normal levels of humility and sense of proportion  (and fulfilled his SWPL image).  Instead he stupidly accepted, as if he&rsquo;s worthy (no, flying to Norway, proclaiming himself unworthy and then accepting the prize does not count - people who consider themselves unworthy of accolades don&rsquo;t accept them).  And now it&rsquo;s too late; now changing his mind will only look like a cynical ploy.  He&rsquo;s the guy at the special olympics who gets a gold medal and gives a big smile for the crowd.  Would <i>you</i> accept a gold medal at the special olympics?  Everyone would cheer and clap for you&hellip;no one would write anything nasty about you in the paper.  But everyone watching would get the joke.  And anyone who didn&rsquo;t would be laughed at; or more accurately, associated with the sort who gets gold medals at the special olympics.</p>
<p>Jared&rsquo;s perfectly right, this will peel off a lot of Obama&rsquo;s less wide-eyed Kool-Aid drinkers.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s appeal is primarily SWPL appeal; SWPLs are very sensitive to blunders like this.  They&rsquo;re self-effacing Europeans, not self-aggrandizing Africans.  Obama&rsquo;s acceptance is very much a generalissimo move in line with the latter&rsquo;s values, and inimical to the former&rsquo;s.  SWPLs thought he was one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blunder, a move so arrogant, so divested from modesty that people with 3-digit IQs can&rsquo;t ignore it.  He&rsquo;s proving he drinks his own Kool-Aid.  The Nobel committee embarrassed themselves by offering the prize to BO, but BO made himself a part of the laughingstock by accepting, a major unforced error.</p>
<p>And it fits right in with the general image of BO offered by the right, an empty &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; suit, third world head of a cult of personality; someone who&rsquo;s earned only a tiny fraction of what he has.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s Nobel Prize: The World as Farce</p>
<p><i>The news that the Nobel Prize Committee has just awarded the coveted Peace Prize to President Barack Obama immediately put me in mind of an anecdote recounted by Margaret MacMillan in her book Nixon and Mao,</i></p>
<blockquote>During the Cultural Revolution, an American remarked casually on an attractive view to a Chinese diplomat, who promptly answered, &ldquo;Yes, it is; but not as beautiful as it is in Beijing where the glorious sun of Chairman Mao Tse-tung shines upon the Chinese people twenty-four hours a day.&rdquo; Years later, after Mao&rsquo;s death, the two men met again in Tanzania. The Chinese looked at the American and said, &ldquo;It is a beautiful day, but not as beautiful as it is in Beijing where the glorious sun of&hellip;&rdquo; and started to laugh. &ldquo;I look back often on that conversation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By God, how stupid it was.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p><i>Besides being amusing, this story illustrates an important point: All cults of personality begin as high drama and end as low comedy.</i></p>
<p>Our job is just to point and laugh.  They hate being mocked by those they consider beneath them.  So go find some lefties, online and/or in real life, point, and laugh.</p>

<p>Not so. Obama has no need of the money. After he leaves office, he will probably half a million dollars or more for each speaking engagement. The fawning leftists will be falling all over themselves to award their capitalist windfalls to this guy. Obama is set for life.

It&rsquo;s probably the best way to get prostitution as low as possible if it&rsquo;s legal for the women but illegal for the men, because it&rsquo;s a fact of life that men initiate sex.  Therefore, there&rsquo;s where you apply the law.</p>

It is not as if this prize will change the course of American foreign policy, nor will it convert thoughtful Americans to reconsider the virtues of deficit, make that huge deficit, spending. What is it all about, Alfie Nobel?<br>
I have a feeling it has to do Obama backing down to placate Russia in the matter of the missile shield in Poland. Good realtions with the country that supplies much of Europe&rsquo;s heat during the winter counts for much more than solidarity with the USA does.<br>

		<p>If the Nobel Prize was ever an honor, it has long since become a joke! Look at some of the past Nobel awards. It is even possible that sensible Norwegians (if there are any) are laughing at us.</p>
<p>Paul Krugman, a hack journalist of the New York Times, whose claim to fame and the Nobel award in &#8220;economics&#8221;, is basically  one can borrow one&rsquo;s way out of debt, and spend one&rsquo;s way to prosperity. </p>
<p>Kind of like Keynes on Steroids.</p>
<p>Then there was the Nobel award given to the prophet of &#8220;global warming&#8221;, one Al Gore. All that Nobel prizewinner Al Gore (and his acolytes) had to offer was a lot of hot air! Nevertheless, uncounted billions of dollars is going to be unaccountably spent, unbelievably destructive regulations are about to cripple energy industries around the world, especially in the USA, and everybody&rsquo;s life is to be impovershed to accomodate this unbelievably farfetched absurdity.</p>
<p>Turn to the sainted big O. He is awarded the Nobel prize, NOT for any accomplishments at all, least of all regarding international peace, but for what the award committee HOPES that he will do! I suppose that if you wanted to apply affirmative action to a totally worthless token award, whose days of honor and prestige were long behind it, Barack Hussein Obama would be as good a candidate as anyone. He at least will look pretty in all the photo ops. Maybe a prize for Miss America will be next!</p>

Iraq and Afghanistan may indeed collapse no matter how long we stay there, but if it happens during Obama&rsquo;s watch, he may get blamed for it&hellip;not by the MSM, of course, but by the public.

		<p>The half of the country who already can&rsquo;t stand him see his affirmative action Nobel Prize as just one more of his frauds. But all the fanatics drinking his koolaid see it as more confirmation of his quasi-divinity. So it&rsquo;s tempting to say the net effects will be a tossup. However, his smitten followers remain in charge. </p>
<p>Have you noticed the MS media has already almost dropped this? It seems off the headlines, like they hope we&rsquo;ll forget how he got his Nobel Prize. Later, they&rsquo;ll evoke it as part of his mystique. His cult is almost like that of North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Il (&#8220;the Dear Leader,&#8221; etc.) who btw also covered up the true details of his birth. At least Obama&rsquo;s non-believers aren&rsquo;t locked up in camps, yet.<br>

		<p>I like the &#8220;oscar for best actor&#8221; idea better. Obama playing a role as &#8220;The Great Uniter&#8221;&hellip; never mind that our country is split worse along political AND racial lines than ever before.</p>
<p>Reality being what it is, the Dems can&rsquo;t face anyone critizing Obama&rsquo;s bungling and are only too happy to label dissention and criticism as &#8220;race-based&#8221;. But I hope and trust the Democrats will come to a rude awakening on November, 2010&rsquo;s Election Day. When American voters decide how much, if at all, they approve of Obama&rsquo;s Administration. Along with Obama&rsquo;s hope of forcing Amnesty down our collective throats with a Executive Order legalizing 30 million CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS!</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;&hellip; explain where you get your crazy Idea of Iran &#8220;nuking&#8221; NYC. They&rsquo;re a long way from implementing nukes. As to delivering it to NYC, don&rsquo;t make me laugh. Obama has a better chance at a third-term than Ahmadinejad has of delivering an effective nuke to NYC, much less an EMP over Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>By the way, given a CHOICE, I&rsquo;d ten-times rather have Iranians here than that number in illegal Mexican immigrants. The Iranians are magnitudes over Mexicans&hellip; despite their religion. I had an Egyptian neighbor who&rsquo;s family came from Iran. You couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better neighbor. The Mexicans on our street&hellip; &#8220;human garbage&#8221; being the appropriate descriptive term.</p>

		<p>The following two observations by Mr. Taylor sum up the entire nation-killing mess we&rsquo;re in right now. It&rsquo;s too bad that such obvious truths even have to be spoken. But we need to boldly repeat them again and again. </p>
<p>• &#8220;All his life, glory and adulation have been handed to him without much effort&hellip;.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the correct venue but when I first saw Thorbjoern Jaglan announce the NPP there was an audible MOAN from the gallery in attendance. Now I don&rsquo;t speak Swedish but grumbling, grousing &ldquo;Oh, my gosh who??&rdquo; is universal. Later that night on MSNBC – same video, same camera angle – the background grumbling had been removed from the audio. Hmmmm.  </p>

Correction! Correction! Correction! <br>
Mistake of Norwegian Nobel Committee!!!!<br>
The Nobel Prize in Economic Science has been announced by a mistake!<br>
The Nobel Prize in Economic Science is awarded to the Obama&rsquo;s wife Michelle Obama.<br>
Some more nominees, including the two Obama&rsquo;s daughters and his two dogs, are  have to wait to the next year. </p>

		<p>Have to disagree with poster #21 to a certain extent&hellip;.list the names of all those Whites you claim are the downfall of Whites here and those in Europe who you say do the same. As for blacks, hispanics etc. who have no hand in our downfall I beg to differ. They are what you call the &#8220;shock troops&#8221;&hellip;.they are being used by the powers that be to destroy all Whites here and abroad. </p>

		<p>  I had a doctor friend from Miami. At the time, several European tourists had been murdered when they got lost leaving the Miami Airport and wound up in the &ldquo;Wrong&rdquo; neighborhood. <br>
He commented that Americans are immersed from birth in PC propaganda about the moral superiority of blacks, but having real-life experience with them, know the PC baloney is precisely that. <br>
Europeans see a couple of bro&rsquo;s on a street corner and rush up to them expecting hugs all around and a consciousness-expanding experience. <br>

How true that is!  It can be a wrenching experience for them.  About that same time, years ago, I was assigned to the 28 Pct. in Harlem, and I can tell you that we regularly had naive European tourists (and I remember at least one Japanese) who went up to Harlem to &#8220;hang wit da bros&#8221; and to bask in the wonderful rich and vibrant culture.  Invariably, they were robbed in no time flat   &mdash;   sometimes immediately upon exiting the subway.  Their stories all read more or less the same.   At least they weren&rsquo;t murdered, just robbed  (those that I dealt with).  But they were in a state of shock.  Blacks weren&rsquo;t supposed to behave this way!&hellip;. except in right-wing racist propaganda.  They had just received a lesson in real life.  It wasn&rsquo;t according to the textbook.</p>
<p>Some (especially the Scandinavians) would try to rationalize it to make it fit within a Marxist interpretation:  that  blacks are so oppressed and desperate that they are forced to rob in order to live, even if it is against their real nature. It&rsquo;s a result of their persecution.  But then, these tourists didn&rsquo;t see any of the horrible conditions and  starvation that they had expected to see.  Where was the suffering?   That was puzzling too. It didn&rsquo;t jibe with their expectations.   </p>
<p>Nowadays there are sightseeing tours of Harlem  so that foreign tourists can travel through safely on a double-decker bus.  (I doubt that many Americans bother.)  Much wiser than wandering around on their own!  I also doubt they are seeing what they were expecting to see   &mdash;   poverty and misery.   Harlem is getting gentrified today, with a lot of construction, new stores,  and mucho money pouring in since Clinton opened his office there.</p>
<p>Incidentally,  I recall that Miami incident. They were German tourists, just arrived off the plane and they got lost in their rental car. (Unless there have been more incidents  since, and probably there have.)</p>

		<p>By awarding the prize, the Nobel Prize Committee wanted to signal their approval for a left-wing President. The award has nothing to do with his bringing peace to a troubled world. It only means that the European left sees little difference between Obama&rsquo;s world view and their own. Obama has had a lock on the prize ever since he ran in the Democratic primaries. This is nothing more than a popularity poll by left-wingers happy to see an American president grovelling before the world. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Norwegian, and it is really eye-popping to read the comments here. For instance, #3: &#8220;The elite in Europe are such utterly sickening far leftists. They haven&rsquo;t got the slightest clue, and probably couldn&rsquo;t care less, how stupid Americans think this decision was. Last I read, some 75% of Americans believe he didn&rsquo;t deserve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was YOU AMERICANS who elected Obama for president, for chrissake. Wasn&rsquo;t that a stupid decision? Did Obama deserve that?</p>
<p>And #8: &#8220;Is this not right out of a screenplay? Is he not straight out of central casting? He was afterall, backed by the Hollywood elite and their money, so doesn&rsquo;t it make you wonder? Who is really behind all this and who conjoured up this character?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, exactly WHO elected Obama for president? If you want to know who is the idiot here, go look in your bathroom. There&rsquo;s probably a mirror there. </p>
<p>And #10: &#8220;The Nobel Committee made it clear that Obama got the Peace Prize not for what he has actually done, but for what it presumed he&rsquo;s capable of doing. Is there any better way to describe &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; than that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, why did YOU AMERICANS elect Obama for president?  Wasn&rsquo;t it for what you presumed he&rsquo;s capable of doing? Wasn&rsquo;t that affirmative action? </p>
<p>And #12:&#8221;Mr. Taylor, as is expected, has delivered an outstanding critique of this beneath absurd nonsense. It is so laughable that this freakish fool, this totem to multiculturalism&rsquo;s abject genocidal degeneracy, has gotten this &ldquo;prize&rdquo; that most are left running to a restroom, simply to avoid soiling themselves in their unrestrained mirth.&#8221; </p>
<p>Personally, I thought it was laughable and beneath absurd nonsense that this freakish fool, this totem to multiculturalism&rsquo;s abject genocidal degeneracy was elected American president.</p>
<p>After all, it was YOU AMERICANS who elected Obama for president. And (sigh): You certainly did not make the situation for us whites in Europe any better by that.  </p>

		<p>Norwegian: You are  preaching to the wrong audience. You are wasting your time blasting readers of Amren.  I very strongly doubt that anybody here voted for Obama.  So stop trying to shift the blame for Norway&rsquo;s idiotic decision onto our shoulders. Maybe SOME Americans voted for Obama, but we certainly didn&rsquo;t give him the Nobel Prize, which has now become nothing but an international joke. </p>

The Nobel is by now nothing but a political football, which is shamelessly used to advance the purposes of people with an agenda.   </p>
<p>Like all the big foundations in America, It&rsquo;s been taken over by extreme left-wingers and has beentwisted to serve their ends. These organizations have all betrayed the original intentions of the philanthropists who founded them.</p>

Norwegian,</p>
<p>The majority of American whites did not vote for Obama. Virtually all non-whites our rulers let flood in since 1965 + 95% of blacks + some deluded, self-loathing whites, together, made a majority for the Democrats. The disastrous Bush administration, his clone McCain as Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;opponent,&#8221; the bad economy + a fawning media all helped Obama win. But most people who used to just be known as &#8220;Americans&#8221; (whites) held their nose and voted for McCain. Around here, I suppose many voted for third parties or stayed home. For sure, you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong site to address Obama voters!<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
I think that pretty well sums up Obama&rsquo;s win.  The whole picture couldn&rsquo;t have been better arranged to guarantee Obama&rsquo;s victory. Was it a set-up?  A deal?   For many people, there really was no acceptable alternative being offered. The people were sick of Bush and anything looked better than him.  Ron Paul was simply shut out and ignored by The Establishment. Ditto with Tancredo. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s  Republican &#8220;opponent&#8221;  was pathetic and refused even to mention such important issues as immigration and Obama&rsquo;s questionable birth certificate.  Thus, McCain effectively handed the victory to Obama. Was it a &#8220;fix&#8221;?  If not, it couldn&rsquo;t have been arranged better.  </p>
<p>Running against the senile McCain, and following the disastrous Bush years, with all other contenders shut out by the media,  even a monkey could have won that election.</p>
