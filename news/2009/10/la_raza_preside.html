<h1>La Raza President Wants Health Care Reform for &#8216;Everyone,&rsquo; Including Illegal Aliens</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Cover, CNS News, October 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguia said that health care reform should include &#8220;everyone,&#8221; and this means illegal immigrants as well because with more people paying into the system it might lower the costs of health care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;From our perspective there&rsquo;s a strong case to be made in this country for us to reform health care [and] it ought to include everyone,&#8221; said Murguia. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of different reasons why we should try to reform this system once and for all so that everyone is covered. The more people who are covered, the more cost-effective and the more and better health outcomes we&rsquo;re going to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that politically it&rsquo;s very difficult right now to take on the issue of undocumenteds [but] there&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to cover as many people as possible, certainly when it comes to undocumented children,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our goal should be to have health care reform for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of the current House and Senate versions of health care reform legislation restrict the availability of federal health insurance subsidies to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Title II, Subtitle C, Section 246 of the House health care bill (H.R. 3200), for example, stipulates &#8220;no federal payment for undocumented aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senate bill says that beneficiaries of federal health care programs must be a citizen or national or an alien lawfully admitted to the United States. But neither bill apparently has a provision for verifying citizenship status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican attempts to amend the health care legislation to require a photo ID and Social Security number and similar safeguards to receive federally subsidized health benefits have been defeated, largely along party lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Comprehensive immigration reform would convert illegal immigrants into legal immigrants who would be permanent legal residents of the United States with an opportunity to be naturalized as U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muguira said on Thursday: &#8220;From our perspective, when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, we need to settle that issue once and for all [because] there&rsquo;s a group of 12 million individuals who&rsquo;ve been making important contributions to this country, we need to find a resolution for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When asked by CNSNews.com to clarify whether a pathway to legalization was the solution to getting insurance coverage for illegal immigrants, Murguia said it was &#8220;a solution&#8221; and that immigration reform was needed so that all reform proposals would not face this potential roadblock.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a solution,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What we have argued all the time is that we should tackle the issue of comprehensive immigration reform once and for all because it may not be health care reform, it could be any other major reform, but these issues of the status of undocumenteds in this country and what&rsquo;s right and fair are going to continue to come up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can resolve that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think we&rsquo;ll go a long way to being able to address these broader reforms without these issues being distractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNSNews.com asked Murguia whether her &#8220;solution&#8221; meant that illegal immigrants would be eligible for federal health insurance subsidies if comprehensive reform is passed. She responded that illegal aliens should be covered along with everyone else, but that who was eligible for which federal programs would depend on the specific reform proposals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, there&rsquo;s a case to be made in the long term for including as many people as possible because it&rsquo;s more cost-effective and because there&rsquo;s better health results and all of that,&#8221; said Murguia. &#8220;In terms of fairness and cost efficiencies I think it&rsquo;s in the interest of health care reform to have access to as many people as possible.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why stop there?  If it&rsquo;s discriminatory not to give ObamaCare to illegal aliens, then it&rsquo;s discriminatory not to give ObamaCare to every human being on Earth.  You know, not everyone has the ability, money or desire to just get up and sneak into the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also discriminatory to limit this just to human beings.  A dog in Vienna needs his broken leg bones reconciled.  Must not be speciesist.  And it&rsquo;s wrong to be mammalist.  All those snail darters in Thailand need ObamaCare.  Insects of the world, unite!</p>

		<p>Making illegal aliens legal is an affront to this country.  It says that anyone can violate our borders and then be rewarded with citizenship.  If this happens it will be the beginning of the end for the United States - Oh wait a minute - we are at the beginning of the end of the United States.  They&rsquo;re here and they haven&rsquo;t been deported and no one is stopping anyone coming in.  And no one is arguing that they should be deported.  Shouldn&rsquo;t we be arguing whether or not to deport them as opposed to whether or not to make them citizens?  Oh, wait a minute again - we SHOULD have deported them already.  Oh snap!  Wait a minute again - they NEVER should have been allowed in in the first place because a healthy country with sane politicians and leaders would never let 12,000,000 illegals (or is it more like 25,000,000) cross our borders and establish residence here at all.  Doe this make sense to anyone?</p>

		<p>A real simple solution to the health care/illegal immigrant situation is to round up the illegals and send them back home. Then the people employing them should be arrested and jailed/fined. People should come into the country legally. Look at Mexico&rsquo;s laws and see what they&rsquo;d do to you for being an illegal worker in Mexico. Canada has very strict laws on that subject also.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t get past the simple concept of the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;. I know, I know&hellip;I&rsquo;m being a naive simpleton.<br>
The very basic fact these people are here ILLEGALLY should preclude the possibility of them getting anything other than a one way ticket back to their country of origin.<br>
We should not even be having a discussion of whether illegals are eligible for stuff. In a sane world once they were discovered to be here illegally they would be arrested and deported.  <br>
 However, the best idea is to turn off the job magnet.  AND, America now has the tool to do just that, it&rsquo;s called  E-Verify.<br>
E-Verify is currently the best means available for employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. E-Verify virtually eliminates Social Security mismatch letters, improves the accuracy of wage and tax reporting, protects jobs for authorized U.S. workers, and helps U.S. employers maintain a stable work force.  </p>

		<p>Well, covering illegals might not quite reduce medical costs for everyone. But for illegals, it&rsquo;s guaranteed to be pleasanter than having to wait in the typical Hospital E.R. Room an hour or so to get their taxpayer-funded FREE HEALTHCARE!</p>

		<p>One bit of this modern math I don&rsquo;t quite understand being&hellip; how can Jose and Carmencita, both earning minimal or even sub-minimal wages AFFORD to pay their share of the health insurance costs? I mean assuming they don&rsquo;t pay into the system because they can&rsquo;t afford it&hellip; how does that lower costs for all of us users?</p>

		<p>As to the beginning of the end of USA.  No, I think the big bullet was the 1913 estabishment of the Federal Reserve Bank, and the IRS, then in 1965, the Civil Rights Act, then the slow and isideous Affirmative Action.  No folks it&rsquo;s not the beginning of the end of America, it&rsquo;s the dying quivers your seeing.</p>

		<p>There is a cost advantage to having illegals go to a doctor&rsquo;s office or urgent care facility (assuming the rules there are different than for ERs), rather than a costly hospital ER.  However, as it has been noted, how are Jose and Carmelita going to pay their $3000/yr premium by working minimum wage jobs?  Oh, wait, is there not a &#8220;hardship&#8221; exemption for those with low incomes?</p>

		<p>Amazing!  Just amazing!  Give healthcare to illegal aliens who, by law, should not even be in this Country!  How about these illegal aliens going back to their own country and getting their healthcare there?  Illegal aliens have no right to be in this Country and are destroying this Country.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens have made America the dumping ground for all their illegal alien children, then we have to school them and give them free medical care. </p>

<p>I for one, am sick and tired of these ILLEGAL ALIENS snubbing their nose at our immigration laws and the many other laws of this Country.  If our Federal Government can not ENFORCE our immigration laws, and get these ILLEGAL ALIENS out of this Country, then let the States do it!  One way or another, an end has to come to this illegal immigration, and not with AMNESTY!  Amnesty will only encourage more ILLEGAL ALIENS to invade our Country and reward those who broke our laws and raped the American taxpayer in many ways&hellip;depressing our wages, taking our jobs, overwhelming our schools with their ILLEGAL ALIEN children, driving without a license or car insurance, all the crime from stolen identities to rape, drugs and everything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for ZERO TOLERENCE with these ILLEGAL ALIENS.  It&rsquo;s time for them get out of this Country and back in their own Country where they belong.  When we get rid of the ILLEGAL ALIENS, we will get rid of all the problems that go with them. THAT IS A FACT!</p>
<p>ENFORCE THE LAW!  NO AMNESTY OR HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS!</p>

		<p>Please keep in mind that it was &#8220;MeChA&#8221; extremists from groups like La Raza who previously stated that elderly white people need to &#8220;hurry up&#8221; and die so that whatever funds are confiscated under Obamacare can be focused on illegal aliens and their anchor babies, and that we Anglos are soiling ourselves in fear as we watch the invaders turn the White House brown.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so interesting that an organization like La Raza is able to operate without being labeled a &#8220;hate group&#8221;.  It is no coincidence that they calm themselves &#8220;La Raza&#8221;&hellip;the whole &#8220;Mexica/Aztlan&#8221; movement is based on the notion of &#8220;Por la Raza todo, fuera de la Raza, nada!&#8221;  Here, it&rsquo;s very clear what &#8220;raza&#8221; they&rsquo;re talking about.  And yet even LEGAL Mexicanistas who actually ENTERED THE COUNTRY WITH PERMISSION - all 200 of them - are very loathe to criticize groups like La Raza or LULAC, for the very same reason that many blacks never seem to rebel against race baiters like Al Sharpton&hellip;they have been successfully propagandized into believing that La Raza is responsible for wrestling the power away from those evil Anglos and doling it out to the Hispanic community.  It&rsquo;s almost like elderly Democrats who are sickened by modern Liberalism but just can&rsquo;t forget what (they think) FDR did for them (or TO them) during the Depression, and will never leave the party.</p>
