<h1>&#8220;Illegal Alien&#8221; Halloween Costume Sparks Ire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>San Francisco Examiner, October 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Southern California immigrant rights group has asked Target stores and a costume company to stop selling an &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; Halloween costume it says is offensive to immigrants.</p>
<p>The costume features the mask of an alien with a green card and an orange jumpsuit with &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; written across the front.</p>
<p>Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, wrote e-mails to Minneapolis-based Target and Wisconsin-based BuySeasons, Inc. Friday calling the costume &#8220;distasteful, mean-spirited, and ignorant of social stigmas and current debate on immigration reform.&#8221; The group said it also planned to send letters to other companies that are selling the costume.</p>

		<p>Ironically, I am offended by this costume as well, but not because it is &ldquo;mean spirited&rdquo; or distasteful&rdquo; toward Hispanics!</p>
<p>I am offended by the fact that it is unfair to extraterrestrials, who do not drunkenly fly their spaceships into American taxpayers and kill them, rape children, or arrogantly demand citizenship as their intergalactic &ldquo;rights.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>The irony is that this costume implies than an &#8220;alien&#8221; is only someone not of this planet and not, say, a foreigner hostile to our culture and language. I guess nuances are lost on some. </p>

<p>Oh yes, we must enforce those &#8220;social stigmas&#8221; at all costs! If we don&rsquo;t enforce them ruthlessly, then how on earth will they remain social stigmas!?</p>
<p>Obviously this costume is a joke and has nothing to do whatsoever with the TRUE illegal aliens menacing this country. But since the immigration hustlers want to ban the very term &#8220;illegal alien,&#8221; they CAN&rsquo;T ALLOW a costume that makes light of that term!!!</p>
<p>Another example of how the only ones who have a true voice in the illegal immigration debate are the illegals themselves, and their advocates.</p>

		<p>From now on I am officially designating myself on all government forms as an &#8220;Other.&#8221;  As an Other, I demand very special rights as there are few people like me around!  I am tired of being different, unwanted, not succeeding, not looking like a supermodel, and not being popular.  All people richer than me need to give me money, subsidized housing and social services because I feel very disadvantaged, and my ancestors were disadvantaged too.  Thanks.</p>

		<p>I would love to halloween with this outfit.</p>
<p>That said, I realize I can&rsquo;t.  In my part of Texas, the county mounties shoot first and ask questions later of people in orange jumpsuits.  They think you have escaped from the county jail.</p>

Now that is somebody who has lived around illegals and has an intimate knowledge of them.  Drunk driving and raping 12 to 14 year old girls is their cutural pastime..well that and soccer. </p>

		<p>And Target has already agreed to remove the costume from it&rsquo;s shelves which doesn&rsquo;t surprise because I know that Target is a very all inclusive, multicultural, diversity first company.  I worked there part-time several years ago and they tolerate everybody, except for politically incorrect Halloween costumes.</p>

		<p>The funny part of this story is the illegal aliens don&rsquo;t look latino at all! There must be a part of this term they find demeaning. To solve this I reccomend they return to their homeland and stop accepting freebies from the U S taxpayers.<br>
Problem solved!!</p>

		<p>Someone thought that they were making a PC point by implying that only Extraterrestrials could be termed &#8220;aliens.&#8221;  Also, they hoped to point out that no one is illegal, a comment I have heard from groups like La Raza in the past.  It backfired.  Some people just don&rsquo;t get it, I guess.</p>
<p>And that is the joke.</p>

		<p>I think the costume is pretty cool, actually!</p>
<p>besides, since it depicts an extraterrstrial kind of «alien», then it implies nothing about Latino immigrants, legal or illegal.</p>
<p>I think those concerned Hispanics should cool it!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s some funny stuff. I am an American from Hispanic (Cuban) parents. I will wear that outfit on Hallowen and I do not care who I offend. Everyone in this country are from immgrants but individuals wanting to come here need to go through the proper channels to become a legal citizens.  Learn the language English it is the universal language so learn it my parents did, and readers don&rsquo;t say well his parents are from Cuba so it was easier for them to get into the country!  Wrong the lived in Europe for years before coming to USA but had to follow the chain of commands and gain promise to come here legal.  So any Hispanic that is offended then go back to your country if you do not like the American way!!!  <br>

<p>That&rsquo;a a good point. The costume would be amusing but what I DON&rsquo;T like about it is the suggestion that &#8220;aliens&#8221; are exterrestrial creatures, something that is entirely erroneous, but a notion which some interested parties want to push. I have hear them say, &#8220;We&rsquo;re not  aliens, we&rsquo;re humans!&#8221;</p>
<p>The word is being intentionally deformed into another meaning.  An alien is simply someone foreign, not a creature from outer space.</p>
