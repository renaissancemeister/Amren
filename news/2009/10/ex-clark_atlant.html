<h1>Ex-Clark Atlanta Coach Alleges Race Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOXSports.com, October 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white football coach is accusing the college&rsquo;s president and athletic director of firing him this week because of the color of his skin.</p>
<p>Ted Bahhur, who was fired Tuesday by Clark Atlanta University, made the allegation against president Carlton Brown and AD Tamica Jones in a racial-discrimination complaint filed Friday with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, lawyer Ed Gadrix told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brown, who is black, did not return messages left Friday, the newspaper reported. In an e-mail message, Jones, who is also black, wrote that she had no comment.</p>
<p>After inheriting a team that had lost 39 of 43 games, Bahhur went 20-29, including 6-5 last season  &mdash;  the team&rsquo;s first winning record since 1991. A three-game losing streak has dropped Clark Atlanta to 3-3 this fall.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Jones told the paper that &#8220;expectations for the team are not W&rsquo;s and L&rsquo;s as they are that we have a responsibility to commit to our young men, as well. That&rsquo;s where we were most lacking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bahhur alleges he was asked questions in meetings and embarrassed by Brown and Jones in ways that black coaches were not.</p>
<p>Bahhur also took exception to Jones&rsquo; questions about his commitment to the players. He said graduation rates improved during his tenure, estimating that 15 of the roughly 25 seniors graduated last spring, two more have since completed requirements and an additional two are on track to complete degree work this spring.</p>
<p>Bahhur said he has also raised money for renovated facilities, including the locker room, weight room and coaches office.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to see a White man with some guts.  This is one story that most of the MSM will avoid discussing, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a decent coach to me. He should come coach at UNLV after they fire their coach. </p>

		<p>Bahhur is white?  Well this redefinition of &#8216;White&rsquo; should be a wake up call for those who think they won&rsquo;t suffer after the end of &#8220;White Hegemony&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think a lot of marginally white people think they&rsquo;ll be sitting pretty, once WASPS are out of the way.  But maybe this portends how wrong they will have been.</p>

		<p>This is a case of a White coach who outperformed his black peers. Apparently, this was too much for the black power structure to swallow. It is much easier for the school&rsquo;s administration to run him out than to get his black peers to perform at the same level. </p>

		<p>Since when is it a football coache&rsquo;s job to make sure the players graduate? It&rsquo;s up to the players to do their schoolwork. Coaches can&rsquo;t be everywhere.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a sports fan to some decent degree &amp; never once in my life heard of this school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is a private, historically black university in Atlanta, Georgia. It was formed in 1988 with the consolidation of Clark College and Atlanta University.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from wikipedia.  I have zero interest in researching this further, but it sure seems like that&rsquo;s not a good job situation for any white, be it football coach or head dishwasher.</p>

<p>Exactly. A lot of the &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; elites, the guys who hate the West think that non-whites will welcome them with open arms, see them gladly as their rulers. No way. The non-whites will simply see them as targets. White targets. But these elitists are too arrogant to ever see this, to even consider it a real possibility. </p>
