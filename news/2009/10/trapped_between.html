<h1>Trapped Between Worlds, Some Latina Teens Consider Suicide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtney Yager, CNN, October 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Such a disconnect between mothers and daughters is what Dr. Luis Zayas, a psychologist at Washington University, suspects is leading an alarming number of Latina teenagers to want to end their lives.</p>
<p>One out of every seven Latina teens, or 14 percent, attempts suicide according to a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of high school students. And Latina high school students have higher attempted suicide rates than white non-Hispanic (7.7 percent) or black non-Hispanic (9.9 percent) girls their age, the CDC reports.</p>
<p>Zayas has spent the last 25 years trying to find out why. He says the typical Latina teen who attempts suicide is 14 or 15, the daughter of immigrant parents, lives in a low-income setting and is caught in an intense battle with her mother over Latino and American cultures.</p>
<p>Research conducted by Zayas has found the girls&rsquo; parents hold strictly to traditional Latino values, while teens who grow up in America learn &#8220;very different models about what girls should do, can do and are permitted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zayas is nearing completion of a five-year study of more than 200 Latina teenagers who live in New York City. More than half of those studied have attempted suicide, {snip}</p>

		<p>This is the sort of thing we should talk more about, to put a spin on our positions that the other side would find more palatable.  </p>
<p>Only the Western(ized) nations offer feminism!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>If for strategic reasons alone, we need to show women that other cultures are bad for them, so that we can break up the political diversity coalition of women and (non-Asian) minorities.  White men are NOT everyone&rsquo;s exploiters.  Women from lesser cultures trap their offspring into traditional, subservient gender roles.</p>

		<p>I find this happens with many cultures.  Parents want their children to stay within their own culture.  Back in my more youthful days I dated around a bit which included a latino and an Armenian girl.  Both times I was followed and approached by family members several times and told to knock it off.  I didn&rsquo;t feel like putting up with it so I backed off.  The latino girl married some jerk mexican who beats her, and the Armenian girl married an Armenian guy who is overall a nice guy.  Still if they are forced to stay within the culture why can&rsquo;t I stress to my children the importance of marrying white?</p>

A few years back, feminists were exposed by citing similar statistics.</p>
<p>They were fond of reporting something to the affect that &#8216;teenage girls attempt suicide at a rate x times higher than boys&rsquo;. It sounded dramatic until you looked into it further.</p>
<p>While girls may have ATTEMPTED suicide at a higher rate, boys, particularly white boys, COMMITTED suicide at a rate, I believe, 5 times that of girls.</p>
<p>A half-hearted attempt at suicide is usually a cry for attention.</p>
<p>The real issue is that white boys are the ones with the actual highest rates of suicide. Despite all the claims of &#8216;rising rates among minorities and girls&rsquo;, the fact is white boys are the ones who are looking for a way out of their troubles and not for attention.</p>

		<p>This illustrates just one of the many problems when different cultures collide   &mdash;   when radically different racial groups attempt to live together.  It would be much easier for these people, and they would be much happier, if they could live in their own &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; culture, back in their own Hispanic country.  </p>
<p>They are not happy living among European-Americans, and European-Americans are not happy having them here.  Each group should be allowed to live as they want, free from the burden of the other.  </p>

<p>AMERICAN CULTURE??  Since when does CNN admit that there is such a thing?  It wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I debated my (liberal) parents about the existence of American culture.  To their chagrin, I demonstrated to them how they, themselves, are products of it.  Today&rsquo;s Americans are taught that America is a &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; nation - which would seem to imply that it has no single culture it can call its own.  Is CNN having a change of heart?  Probably not.  This one just inadvertently slipped by the editors somehow.</p>
<p>In any case, taken at face value, it would seem that whites are not the only victims of multi-culturalism.</p>

The daughter has been &#8220;turned out&#8221;.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this exactly what pimps are looking for, as reported many times by the msm?</p>
<p>&#8220;intense battle&#8221; &#8220;over Latino and American cultures.&#8221;<br>
Yeah.  Daughter is American, hence the need for mucho dineros.<br>
Mom is traditional, Christian, Mexican.  Hence, daughter is a ho.</p>
<p>Logical.</p>

<p>The type of attention they are exposed to every day by the msm and their schools is not the kind anyone would want.  It&rsquo;s difficult for parents to overcome the hateful, unrelenting, government-promoted, anti-White culture their White sons must face daily. </p>
<p>School textbooks and lefty teachers all the way through college tell White males that they are the scourge of the earth, suppressing and oppressing &#8216;people of color&rsquo; and for this they must hand over their ill-gotten wealth and relinquish their country.  </p>
<p>White males are mocked, impugned and laughed at by the msm. On TV and in advertising, White males are portrayed as morons, clueless buffoons, uneducated helpless dolts who are in need of rescue from their hopeless idiocy by wise, kindly blacks and little children.  They watch as the media depict blacks as brilliant doctors, erudite lawyers or cutting-edge scientists and they are cast as murderers, child abusers and common criminals brought to justice by non-Whites.</p>
<p>They are looking for a way out of their troubles in a world that has no sympathy for them.</p>
<p>BTW: I have started a monograph, at the suggestion of Spartan24, to chronicle the anti-White propaganda that I come across in school textbooks and other mandated multi-culti educational materials that I must deal with.  I&rsquo;d like to publish what I&rsquo;ve come across but I know if I put my real name to it, I&rsquo;d lose my job.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;American culture&#8221; this article speaks of is not a culture at all, it is a product of the entertainment/porn industry.  Not all Mexicans want their 16 year old daughters to be pregnant by some car thief with a tattoo on his neck.  I wish more White parents had the dignity of these girls&rsquo; parents.  </p>

		<p>No doubt about it &hellip; every one goes through their internal wars in the growth or stagnation of their identity. Which is why I believe that social do gooders and social engineers can be unleashing different forms of hell not the heaven they think. Whether the Forced busing of the sixties or the dismantling of Aparteid or western powers telling Arabs how to treat their women or western powers allowing so many third worlders within their own cultures&hellip; its all recipe for unecessary social vexation. Growth is a part of healthy life but not one size fits all symultaneously.</p>

<p>&gt; Another highly pertinant post by sbuffalonative.</p>
<p>That is my assessment; white male children are lost.  Even the ones in my neighborhood seem to only know about Michael Jackson, etc.  He showed up at my door with the other boys to deliver some school cookies I had ordered from him, dressed up almost like a clown.  &#8220;I&rsquo;m Michael Jackson,&#8221; he said.  All I could come up with at the moment was, &#8220;At least you don&rsquo;t have to dye your skin white.&#8221;</p>
<p>White boys are suppressed so badly in our elementary schools while girls and minorities are constantly lifted up, that the white boys have to either become non-white in their identity, or turn to the darker reflections concerning their future.  And the boys on my street are just entering the age when they will begin to look towards their future.  I am going to try to help them every way I can, and I do whenever I get a chance.  But it is hard, with the media and the government weighing down so hard.</p>

<p>Let me get this straight, you&rsquo;re claiming that suicide rates demonstrate white boys to be incomparably anguished due to having every aspect of their collective self esteem methodically crippled? That&rsquo;s quite a stretch. It&rsquo;s a complex issue, and there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of other causes and clues to look at to try to actually get a decently clear picture of it.</p>
<p>-failed suicides could be incredibly difficult for males, other men would viciously look down on them, so if they want to kill themselves, they&rsquo;re compelled to be very careful to succeed<br>
-countries like Finland, for example, have much higher suicide rates than places like the US<br>
-Japan has a pretty high suicide rate, with the same gender disparity as America, despite healthy nationalism and despite Japan being very much a man&rsquo;s world. This is pretty telling clue.<br>
-women prefer less disfiguring, seemingly less painful methods<br>
-in China, where strong rat poisons are easily available, the suicide rate for women is actually higher than for men, less violent means are preferred even if they are no less lethal</p>
