			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate McCarthy, ABC News, October 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Babytalk magazine named Rowan Spracklen the winner of its 10th annual cover contest on &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; viewers from across the country logged on in record-setting numbers to cast 16,000 votes for the 14-month-old baby from Erie, Pa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rowan had a &#8220;personality like no other kid we saw,&#8221; Connery [Babytalk editor-in-chief Ana Connery] said.</p>
<p>November is National Adoption Month, something that has a special meaning for the Spracklen family, who adopted Rowan from Ethiopia in January when he was 6 months old.</p>
<p>Baby Rowan was abandoned at a police station and sent to an orphanage. Although the orphanage took care of him as well as they could, his parents said he was malnourished and sick.</p>
<p>Despite this, Rowan has adjusted well to his new surroundings. His family calls him a miracle and a survivor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rowan&rsquo;s mother decided to enter the contest because, she says, whenever they are in public, people always stop to admire him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The contest was launched in March, and Rowan was one of eight semi-finalists chosen from more than 50,000 entries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I caught this story on GMA before the baby was selected. Without seeing the kids, I KNEW they would pick a black baby. We can never be allowed to forget that the time of the White man is over. </p>
<p>Diane Sawyer, along with the Gibson guy, have got to be among the stupidist people on TV. I keep wondering if this is an act on their part, but they really seem to be morons. </p>

		<p> Wonder how many of those who voted for this baby were White people who thought, &#8220;Oh, if I don&rsquo;t vote for this poor little black baby, I&rsquo;ll feel SOOO racist!&#8221; And what did the one person mean when they said he had &#8220;a personality like no other kid we saw&#8221;? What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? He had a wonderful personality because he&rsquo;s black?</p>

		<p>There is no way these contests are the result of public voting. I am quite sure the editors gave more than a helping hand to make sure this kid was the winner. I hope there are a lot of angry white parents who entered the contest who might start to see the light because of shenanigans like this. What percentage of Babytalk readers is white? If it is not an explicitly black-oriented publication, I would wager it is 95% plus.</p>

		<p>I just watched the video and they state flat out that GMA and Babytalk editors picked the eight semi-finalists. This winner is NOT the choice of the Babytalk readership. Typical liberal media elites contriving another black victory. Listen to the GMA host fawn over this run of the mill black African baby. And you wonder why Obama won the Nobel? These people are all the same.  </p>

		<p>I just watched the video and a very politically correct baby video at that.  Let&rsquo;s see, I saw Asians, Hispanic, a touch of Arab (I believe) and so on.  But Of course they chose the little black baby, duh!  Because Obama&rsquo;s in da house!  Toto, this isn&rsquo;t Kansas anymore   &mdash;  - and I&rsquo;m sure the editors of Baby Talk magazine see that, too.   </p>

		<p>I saw this in the news yesterday.  Before I even clicked on the article, I knew what I going to see, a non-white baby.  Even after I saw the name of the child, I knew it was going to be a minority. I think I would have been honestly shocked had it been a white baby. It seems like in any contest nowadays, a non-white will most likely be the winner.</p>

		<p>Oh, brother!  More black worship is being shoved down our throats again? I am really positive there were no cute White kids and especially who had &#8220;personality&#8221;? Give me a break. We all know what this is about just as we now have a black Miss Sweden and a black Miss France? As if they can be Swedish or French! </p>

		<p>Well its an easy way for whites to feel magnanimous. No commitment, no need to change their own lifestyle, neighborhood or neighbors. Just vote for somebody else&rsquo;s black baby as &#8220;cutest&#8221; or whatever. </p>
<p>But this next statement really troubles me:</p>
<p><i>Rowan had a &ldquo;personality like no other kid we saw,&rdquo; Connery [Babytalk editor-in-chief Ana Connery] said.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to discriminate against all the other babies based on personality? I mean, come on! No one chooses the &#8220;personality&#8221; they&rsquo;re born with! This is pure discrimination!</p>

		<p>I just wanted to add that if this kid is from Ethiopia then he is obviously part white. He&rsquo;s far too light to be pure Ethiopian. I wonder how much of his &#8220;cuteness&#8221; comes from his white genes? His light skin makes him far more palatable to white viewers.</p>

		<p>again, i apologize for no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation.</p>
<p>any contest of beauty, be it baby, child, teen or young adult is &#8221;challenged&#8221; between the most pretty or beautiful white contestant and the one black contestant, if entered. i have been saying this since the first black ms. u.s.a. winner vanessa williams. she had to give up her title back in 1984 due to some naked/lesbian-oriented pic&rsquo;s that were released just after the contest. <br>
since then, any contest b/t blacks and whites - be it in  bodybuilder&rsquo;s contest or an american idol contest - is scewed toward the blacks&hellip;otherwise the judges risk being labeled with the dreadeed term &#8221;racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I just returned from visiting a white church where a notice was posted in the bulletin requesting donations for a family who had just adopted two Ethiopian children.  Made me wonder why they couldn&rsquo;t have adopted some white children closer to home. Maybe the only white children available would have been older or had disabilities or drug exposures that would make them less desirable. Or maybe they just wanted to help the poor downtrodden Africans more than equally deserving white children in their own country. I guess they never heard the aphorism &#8220;Charity begins at home.&#8221;</p>

Of course!   Just notice   &mdash;   in just about any advertisement, department store circular, etc., they will present a carefully chosen assortment of babies (too carefully mixed to be accidental   &mdash;   something of this, something of that) &hellip; But right smack in the center will be the cute little black baby. Practically guaranteed!  </p>
<p>Even with adults, it&rsquo;s usually the black who is placed squarely in the center, in sharpest focus, or shown in the position of being obviously in charge.</p>

		<p>Oh my, How Open Minded of Them. I am so glad all the needy children of Their Own Race have been taken care of. Don&rsquo;t most Good Parents Take Care Of THEIR OWN FIRST? This is not an adoption, it is a Statement a Statement saying &#8220;see how open minded and wonderful we are, we help those who hate us before we help our own&#8221; Who knows maybe the baby will get a good Affirmative Action education to where it can write it&rsquo;s own name and add 2 plus 2 then and only then it can reach for the stars. Who knows it could even become President Of The United States? If there is such a place when it is grown?</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, black babies are a dime a dozen.  White babies are a little tougher to get.  That&rsquo;s because the African mentality is incredible.  When they can barely feed themselve or their first born, they have two more.  Even more incredible is Whites try to enpower them to continue.</p>
<p>What really makes me angry over this story is the couple has two of three natural children of their own.  Now they will have to share their resources with mom and dad&rsquo;s new pet. Incidentily, the pet&rsquo;s picture was lightened up considerably in the mag.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and our president may getting ready to start WWIII and he won a Noble Peace prize!</p>
