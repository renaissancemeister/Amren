			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), October 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few days ago, Christian Rochelle Woods, 21, was charged with manslaughter and two counts of aggravated child abuse after filing a false missing child report on her deceased daughter.</p>
<p>Under questioning, Woods admitted to detectives that she left her three children at home alone for two days, from Saturday morning until Monday. Upon her arrival, she discovered the lifeless body of her18-month-old daughter, Myleahya. Woods, then tossed the toddler into a garbage can.</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed that the little girl was severely underweight, only weighing 11 pounds. The average weight for an 18-month-old is about 25 pounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At her arraignment, Woods told Judge John Simon that she was working at a company in Mobile, AL, though her arrest report lists her as unemployed.</p>
<p>An Escambia County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office report described the living conditions in the house as &#8220;filthy&#8221; and apparently roach infested. There was no electricity nor running water in the house.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her two other children, Jaterius and Mykayhla are both being treated at Sacred Heart Hospital for pneumonia and malnutrition.</p>
<p>Woods has a MySpace page with the title: &#8220;Life&rsquo;s short so I live mine to tha fullest.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why does the media ignore the epidemic child abuse in the black &#8220;community&#8221;? The daily reports of rapes and broken bones and crushed skulls and scalding and &#8220;axydently&#8221; falling out of buldings are treated as isolated events, but any reasonable person can see a pattern and a propensity for blacks to abuse children. </p>

		<p>21, black, single, with three kids.  No doubt the children all ahve different fathers.  Leaving a baby alone for 2 days, not feeding it, not surprised here.</p>
<p>This is the type of woman we put on an equal basis with widowed and divorced moms because we call them all &#8220;single moms&#8221; so as not to make the floozies feel bad.  Doomed, we are doomed.</p>

		<p>Sad to say, but the infant is probably much better off. This biological egg donor (I refuse to call her a mother) is a poster child of today&rsquo;s young, black females. The ridiculous conglomeration of vowels and consonents they come up with, hand-tossed to become a name; absolute lack of responsibility, lack of regard for life, lack of bonding in a maternal way, too lazy to earn a living to support herself or those humans that she created, and most of all, the self-absorbed attitude of &#8220;it&rsquo;s all about me,&#8221;, and &#8220;ain&rsquo;t no kids gonna change the way I live.&#8221; Like many other counties in this country, Escambia County used to be higher class.</p>

		<p>FOX news loves to endlessly cover these kinds of stories.  Only problem is that it didn&rsquo;t involve a meth addicted white woman living in a trailor.</p>
<p>But I guess the mainstream media would have made a much bigger deal if it involved a white woman </p>

		<p>It is quite clear that the evil white man is to blame for this. If only her welfare benefits and unemployment had covered free electricity, free water and a live-in care-giver then this would not have happened.</p>
<p>We need a constitutional amendment guaranteeing these basic human rights. DO IT FOR THE CHILDREN!</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget all the care-giver jobs that will be created and therefore stimulate the economy. This is the exact kind of wise financial policy that will pay off our 10 trillion dollar debt and make social security and Medicare solvent.<br>

		<p>Yes, they would have made a bigger deal of it if it were a white woman. Can you guess why, &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;? Because it would be the exception and not the rule for whites whereas it seems the RULE for blacks. I can assure you there are far more meth-addicted black women living in squalid, violent, degenerating projects than meth-addicted white women living in trailers (which most probably OWN).I can tell by your butt-hurt, whiney post that you, like most blacks and their sympathizers, don&rsquo;t like ANY story about black that isn&rsquo;t a glowing, grovelling,undeserved  pat-on-the-back. Blame whites. Blame FOX news. You and your ilk are like a broken record. You probably think blacks are &#8220;underserved&#8221;. Well, we think they are UNDESERVED.</p>

		<p>Check out the names for her three kids. Then consider the article just above this one on AmRen about employer &#8220;discrimination&#8221; about black names. In reality you can be fairly sure when a Jaterius, Mykayhla, or a Myleahya is seeking work they are probably not on the honor roll at Harvard. </p>
<p>By the way, I have absolutely no idea how to even begin to pronounce these names. Nor would I have any idea how to spell them without pre-knowledge. </p>

<p>In case your wondering no myspace did not delete her profile, yep its still up there.  Note the login date of last Sunday, meaning she was chatting it up on myspace the day her infant died.  Classy woman, Life is short, is serious irony for someone who murdered a one year old.</p>
<p>And I say murdered since there is no way you can leave an 18 month alone for two days without expecting it to die,  especially one who is already malnourished and sickly.  Seems like a poorly executed scheme to murder the child and hide its death in order to collect more welfare. Prosecutors should push for Murder in the 1st Degree, not manslaughter. What a wretched life it must have had.<br>

<p>This is hardly news. Many White women in early America to World War II suffered from psychological disorders including schizophrenia. White fathers raping their children was commonplace as well.</p>

		<p>Probably &#8220;a Black thing&#8221; we Whites just couldn&rsquo;t understand. Amazing how many horror stories like this we seem to come across in the news. That Black guy who killed his girl friend, burned (and ate some of)her remains on the barbecue. Those stories coming out of Africa&hellip; children being murdered so their body parts can be used in making Black magic charms.</p>
<p>Oh well&hellip; different cultures, different ideas, one might suppose.</p>

		<p>I see no race issues here.  I see people hurting.  Sweet babies who probably never knew   love.  I cried when I read this article, but then I was also alarmed to action.  I&rsquo;m going to start volunteering at the local crisis nursery to work on preventing something like this from happening again.  Life is hard, we&rsquo;ve got to take care of each other.</p>
