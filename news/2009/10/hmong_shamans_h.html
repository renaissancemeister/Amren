<h1>Hmong Shamans Help at Valley Hospitals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Anderson, Fresno Bee, October 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Staff at most hosptials would be baffled by an instruction like this on a bedside chart: to prepare patient for surgery, provide 15 minutes of soft chanting and tie a red string around the neck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different at Mercy Medical Center in Merced. There, nurses know they must call a shaman.</p>
<p>Mercy is the nation&rsquo;s first hospital with a formal policy for Hmong shamans, allowing the traditional healers, working alongside doctors, to help patients recover.</p>
<p>Hospitals across the country are paying attention as they seek to accommodate cultural beliefs of diverse patient populations.</p>
<p>In the San Joaquin Valley, the Hmong are one of a few ethnic groups  &mdash;  including some indigenous Mexican cultures  &mdash;  that practice shamanism. For those with traditional beliefs, calling on a spiritual healer is as important to good health as making an appointment with a doctor. They may go without care if they can&rsquo;t have a shaman nearby, sometimes with devastating consequences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Hmong believe a soul can become lost or captured by spirits. The spirits can affect the person&rsquo;s health and well-being, and until the soul is restored, the Hmong believe, the physical body won&rsquo;t heal. The shaman, in a trance, negotiates with spirits for the return of the soul.</p>
<p>Other Valley hospitals may allow shaman healing ceremonies, but only Mercy guarantees the right in writing. The Hmong Health Collaborative  &mdash;  a group of area agencies  &mdash;  hopes the other hospitals will follow Mercy&rsquo;s lead.</p>
<p>That remains to be seen. Not all the hospitals are sure they want to single out one group of spiritual healers. But in the months since Mercy adopted its policy in June, the hospital has been receiving calls from as far away as Malaysia from people who want to know how it works.</p>
<p>A national need</p>
<p>Nationwide, hospitals are learning to become more creative in their outreach to communities, health experts say.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission, the agency that accredits most U.S. hospitals, found examples in an anoymous survey. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a written policy that details procedures for accommodating a specific cultural belief is rare, said Jacqueline Voigt-Dieball, cultural-competency manager at the University of Michigan Health System.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The hospital, owned by the national nonprofit chain Catholic Healthcare West, is licensed for 174 beds and sees an average of four Hmong patients a day. Caring for patients&rsquo; spiritual health as well as their physical health is part of the hospital&rsquo;s mission, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole healing process has to be a holistic approach,&#8221; Wilkerson said.</p>
<p><b>Chants and string</b></p>
<p>Mercy&rsquo;s policy lists nine healing ceremonies that shamans are allowed to perform.</p>
<p>Most involve soft chanting to promote healing, strengthen the body, keep the body safe or call the soul back to the body.</p>
<p>Shamans can tie strings around a neck and wrist. A red string around the neck helps in healing, and a white string around a wrist maintains a soul during hospitalization.</p>
<p>A shaman, or &#8220;txiv neeb&#8221; in Hmong, can ask the Mercy hospital staff for permission to do ceremonies that go beyond chanting. An example would be a request to sprinkle water over incisions. According to Mercy&rsquo;s policy, hospital staff are to try to make accommodations.</p>
<p>The ceremonies can occur in patient rooms, in the emergency department or in surgery preparation areas.</p>
<p>The hospital ceremonies are brief  &mdash;  10 to 15 minutes. By contrast, healing rituals conducted in private homes can last hours and typically involve a drum, bells and the rattling of rings.</p>
<p>Before the policy, Hmong healing ceremonies were occurring, but the hospital gave shamans only tacit, informal consent. One private social-service agency  &mdash;  Healthy House within a MATCH Coalition  &mdash;  pushed for a formal policy. The nonprofit multicultural health organization works closely with the Hmong community.</p>
<p>A written policy &#8220;recognizes the value of this complementary healing service,&#8221; said Marilyn Mochel, clinical director at Healthy House.</p>
<p>While many Hmong have excelled in college, become professionals and embraced Western beliefs, Mochel estimates that 70% of Hmong in the Valley follow traditional beliefs and can benefit from a shaman healing policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A long road</b></p>
<p>There are more than 55,000 Hmong between Sacramento and Bakersfield; about 7,000 live in Merced County, which has a population of about 246,000. In the decades since they fled the remote mountains of Laos after a Communist takeover in 1975, they have had to reconcile traditional healing practices with Western medicine.</p>
<p>Unfamiliarity with Western medical practices has led to distrust among the Hmong refugees who settled in the Valley. Some of the biggest fears surround surgery  &mdash;  that the removal of body parts could affect them in the next life after reincarnation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During evening classes, the shamans looked through microscopes, learned about prescription drugs, X-rays and blood tests, and toured the hospital, including stops inside empty operating rooms.</p>
<p>Shamans invited doctors to their homes, where the physicians learned about Hmong healing beliefs and witnessed traditional spiritual healing ceremonies.</p>

		<p>&#8220;to sprinklle water over incisions&hellip;&#8221; Are they crazy?!?!? Reminds me of the 4x8 foot sign over the kitchen in a Steakhouse I once worked at. It said, &#8220;Infection starts from scratch!&#8221; And now from &#8220;water sprinkled over incisions! So much for water proof bandages&hellip;</p>

		<p>Aside from probably being illegals and taking up valuable space and money in our overburdened health care system, I see nothing wrong with this.  Surgery is a scary thing for people to go through and probably all of us would seek spiritual guidance and comfort in such a situation.  The only problem that can arise is when a spiritual leader tells someone to seek nonmedical treatment instead of life saving medical treatment.  But then again that could take one illegal out of the system.</p>

		<p>Umm sure, this story reminds me why I moved my family away from Fresno and the state 20 years ago. Calif wake up and just give those people tickets back to where they came from, and maybe just maybe the real people who were born and raised in Calif might come back.</p>

		<p>Big picture time.  The Hmong are here because Whites brought them here.  Whites brought them here because Whites invaded their homeland, enlisted their help, and then ran away.  </p>
<p>Many Whites also believe in various forms of quackery.  Soon both Hmong quacks and White quacks will be on Obama&rsquo;s payroll.  The question that remains is:  What type of quack do Afghans use?</p>

		<p>This is insane. God only knows that they aren&rsquo;t even PAYING for the surgery anyway, now they want their witch doctors in on it too! Whats next, sacrificing a goat in the operating room before surgery! These people need to be told that this is AMERICA and they need to adopt OUR customs or get the hell out. Are they too stupid to realize that if their witch doctors were so good, why in the hell are they having to run to the &#8220;White devil&#8221; for medical treatment!</p>

		<p>   And you thought your medical bills were already way too high . Now you&rsquo;ll be getting a bill from the witch doctor on top of your hospital bill, doctor bill, x-rays and anesthesiologist bill. And don&rsquo;t forget the charges for trinkets and dried bones . Now why couldn&rsquo;t our 20th century ancestors see the benefit of this really ancient, holistic healing ? We are really making progress now in the 21st century . Yes siree Bob .</p>

<p>The problem with a lot of these &#8220;traditional healers&#8221; is they typically engage in all kinds of scams and deception with typically fatal results when dealing with real medical problems.</p>
<p>For example one common scam is so called &#8220;psychic surgery&#8221;  Psychic surgery is a cheap palor trick where the shaman uses sleight of hand to make it appear that he is miraculously removing harmfully substances such as cancers from a persons body right through their skin(!) when in fact he is just concealing animal guts in the palm of his hand. Comedian Any Kaufman died because a shaman performed this on him and led him to believe that his cancer was cured and needed no further treatement, which was of course not the case.</p>
<p>These practices may seem silly and harmless but they really do kill many people. Furthermore, due to Western&rsquo;s widespread belief that all things non-white = good, many of these bizarre and insane practice gain widespread acceptance here.</p>
<p>The most popular Asian scam, acupuncture, which is nothing more than a very very expensive placebo effect, is now covered by many insurance plans, bilks billions from those suffering with chronic pain. The premise of acupuncture contradicts most of our accepted scientific knowledge and is based on imaginary energy fields which (conveniently) cannot be measured, detected, or sensed by anyone other than the practitioners of this scam. </p>
<p>Another similar scam which has been imposed on the West from Asia, Reiki, is even more ludicrous and posits that most ailments can be cured by waving your hands over a sick person and manipulating his &#8220;Qi&#8221; or &#8220;chi.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I frankly don&rsquo;t care if people want to flush their own money down the toilet but when hospitals and insurance companies start funding this insanity (which they do in the case of acupuncture) it translates into very real costs for everybody.    </p>

		<p>Nor should Afro-American medical treatments exclude amulets made of human body parts or feather-clad witch doctors chanting over the patients. After all, we would hardly wish to discriminate against anyone. Every racial group being entitled to the best of medical care, including what racists once labeled childish superstitions, right?</p>

<p>Well, the average white american had no control over what the CIA did during vietnam.  So just because they screwed up one generation of Hmong, doesn&rsquo;t mean that we have to support endless generations over here.</p>
