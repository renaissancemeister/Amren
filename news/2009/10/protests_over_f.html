<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin has insisted he is &#8220;not a Nazi&#8221; during his first appearance on the BBC&rsquo;s Question Time.</p>
<p>The political discussion programme was recorded as anti-fascist campaigners protested outside Television Centre.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin was booed at the start of the recording and accused of having &#8220;poison politics&#8221; as he was attacked by fellow panellists and the audience.</p>
<p>He said he had been &#8220;demonised&#8221; and repeatedly denied saying things which have been attributed to him.</p>
<p>The BBC has defended the invitation to the leader of the anti-immigration party to appear on the programme, saying it had a duty to be impartial.</p>
<p>During the show the panel covered topics including whether it was fair for the BNP to use images of Winston Churchill in their campaigns and whether immigration policy had fuelled the BNP&rsquo;s popularity.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Demonised&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Justice Secretary Jack Straw said what distinguished the BNP from other parties was that other parties &#8220;have a moral compass&#8221;, adding: &#8220;Nazism didn&rsquo;t and neither I&rsquo;m afraid does the BNP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin, who said his father had been in the RAF during World War II, said he had been &#8220;relentlessly attacked and demonised.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not a Nazi and never have been&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin repeatedly denied he had said many of the things he had been quoted as saying including a quote attributed to him in the Mail on Sunday that Adolf Hitler went &#8220;a bit too far&#8221;.</p>
<p>He claimed his efforts to change the BNP meant he was unpopular with the far right. &#8220;There are Nazis in Britain and they loathe me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He admitted sharing a platform with former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  &mdash;  but claimed he had been trying to win over &#8220;youngsters&#8221; Duke was trying to &#8220;lead astray&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Mr Straw said when anybody put a specific quotation to Mr Griffin he tried to &#8220;wriggle out of it&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Not racist&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Conservative frontbencher Baroness Warsi said Mr Griffin was &#8220;a thoroughly deceptive man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked whether a misguided immigration policy had fuelled the BNP&rsquo;s popularity Mr Straw said he did not think it had and said he thought the BNP had been boosted by discontent with the main parties over issues like expenses.</p>
<p>But Baroness Warsi said politicians had a responsibility to take on the BNP on the issue of immigration: &#8220;Many people who vote for the BNP are not racist and therefore what we have to do is go out and say to these people as mainstream political parties we are prepared to listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Grffin blamed the &#8220;political elite&#8221; for imposing &#8220;an enormous multicultural experiment on the British people&#8221;.</p>
<p>But his references to Britain&rsquo;s &#8220;indigenous people&#8221; prompted other members of the panel to challenge him to say he meant white people.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said the colour was &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; and said Mr Straw would not dare go to New Zealand and tell a Maori he was not &#8220;indigenous&#8221;. &#8220;We are the aborigines here,&#8221; he claimed.</p>
<p>But he was accused of making up facts. He was also challenged by several black and Asian members of the audience.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Red carpet&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>One man asked Mr Griffin: &#8220;Where do you want me to go? I love this country, I&rsquo;m part of this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the programme, which is being broadcast at 2235 BST, was being recorded the anti-BNP protest continued, with the whole west London BBC building &#8220;locked down&#8221; for more than an hour and the road outside closed.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police say six protesters were arrested and three police officers injured in the protests.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin accused the protesters of &#8220;attacking the rights of millions of people to listen to what I&rsquo;ve got to say and listen to me being called to account by other politicians&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Weyman Bennett from Unite Against Fascism accused the BBC of &#8220;rolling out the red carpet&#8221; to Mr Griffin and said his appearance on the flagship discussion programme &#8220;will lead to the growth of a fascist party&#8221; and promote violence against ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The crowd gathered at the main gates of TV centre in west London from mid afternoon. At about 1630 BST security guards opened a gate to let a car into the front car park about 25 people rushed forward and jumped over the barriers, one of which broke, and ran towards the building.</p>
<p>There were also protests outside BBC buildings in Bristol, Liverpool, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday BBC director general Mark Thompson said it was up to the government to ban the BNP from the airwaves if it felt Mr Griffin should not be allowed to take part in Question Time.</p>
<p>Some high profile Labour politicians  &mdash;  including cabinet ministers Peter Hain and Alan Johnson  &mdash;  have said they opposed the BBC decision to allow the anti-immigrant party a place on Question Time.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it was a matter for the corporation and he did not want to interfere with it, while Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said that most of the cabinet did not share Mr Hain&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>BBC Deputy Director General Mark Byford had earlier defended the BBC&rsquo;s decision to invite Mr Griffin, whose party gained its first Euro MPs this year, on to the flagship political programme.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;They should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It&rsquo;s not for the BBC to censor and say they can&rsquo;t be on.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20091020/EU.Britain.Far.Right/">Protests Over Far-Right Leader on BBC TV Program</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jill Lawless, Comcast News, October 22, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Anti-fascist protesters broke into the BBC&rsquo;s west London headquarters on Thursday ahead of a white-supremacist party leader&rsquo;s appearance on a leading political debate show.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the BBC Television Center in an increasingly rowdy rally against British National Party chief Nick Griffin, who is due to appear on the broadcaster&rsquo;s &#8220;Question Time&#8221; program. At one point about 25 people breached a police cordon and ran into the center&rsquo;s lobby.</p>
<p>BBC footage showed some being pulled across the floor by their arms and legs by security.</p>
<p>The BBC said later that Griffin had managed to make it into the building, where he is scheduled to be a panelist on &#8220;Question Time&#8221;  &mdash;  a first for the far-right party.</p>
<p>Many politicians have condemned the invitation to Griffin, but the BBC says that as a publicly funded broadcaster it must cover all political parties that have a national presence. Justice Secretary Jack Straw, a senior member of the governing Labour Party Cabinet, is due to appear alongside Griffin.</p>
<p>The whites-only BNP opposes immigration and claims to fight for &#8220;indigenous&#8221; Britons. Griffin has a conviction for racial hatred and has denied the Holocaust in the past.</p>
<p>The party has tried to shed its thuggish image and enter the political mainstream. Earlier this year it won two European Union parliament seats, gaining 6 percent of British votes in European polls. It has no seats in the British Parliament.</p>
<p>The invitation to appear in front of several million TV viewers has divided Britain, but delighted the BNP, which is counting down the seconds until the broadcast on its Web site.</p>
<p>It has sparked a debate between free-speech advocates and those who say giving Griffin a platform lends legitimacy to unacceptable views and could provoke racist violence.</p>
<p>Several dozen demonstrators handed leaflets to staff outside BBC Television Center Thursday. Campaigners said they expected hundreds more to show up later when the show was being recorded.</p>
<p>Griffin said he expected a hostile reception, but had a right to be heard, and insisted his views had been misrepresented.</p>
<p>&#8220;If these people would only let us say what we want to say and then argue with what we&rsquo;ve actually got to say instead of creating monsters and then being wound up about the monsters, everyone would get on far better,&#8221; Griffin said.</p>
<p>The head of the Muslim Council of Britain, Muhammad Abdul Bari, said &#8220;allowing the BNP to air its toxic views will increase Islamophobia and give the BNP aura of respectability needed to spread their message of hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Griffin&rsquo;s appearance would expose the party&rsquo;s &#8220;racist and bigoted&#8221; views.</p>
<p>The BBC is wary of government interference in its political coverage. In the 1980s, the Conservative government banned radio and TV appearances by members of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. The broadcaster hired actors to read their words instead.<br>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t set the frame of the debate there! The reporter has a good point though. Racial violence should never be tolerated. The only way to keep racial violence out of the country is to keep non-whites who are committing this violence out of the country. It also stops evil white racists from committing violence, and protects noble and Christlike nonwhites from their evil bad thoughts, too. Any view that doesn&rsquo;t accept the notion immigration leads to violence, even if it is only against those guilty whites who surely deserve it, is a notion that is not only unacceptable, it flies up against the face of reality too.</p>

		<p>I watched the selective clip of Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s Question Time appearance on the BBC website and it was edited to make him look bad.  Mr. Griffin seemed nervous and defensive, but this is reasonable considering that everyone on the panel and in the audience was attacking him verbally.  I believe that the BBC invited Nick onto the show only in an attempt to make a fool of him.</p>

		<p>The arguments against Griffin run circular: His opponents accuse him of being &#8216;wrong&rsquo; because he likes &#8216;wrong&rsquo; things. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t yet seen anyone offer a credible defense of why they think white solidarity is wrong.  They accept themselves to be right as an article of faith.  The whole thing looks like Griffin being put on trial for heresy or blasphemy. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much good going on the BBC does for the BNP. </p>
<p>Especially on a program like this where all the questions are loaded and the audience is against them. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a term used by the media, &#8220;concision,&#8221; which basically means that it is impossible to voice unpopular views in a short period of time without sounding like you&rsquo;re from Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly what was going on in the debate.</p>
<p>Although I must admit that it was amusing to watch the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; on the panel and in the audience defend Winston Churchill as if he was a slightly paler and fatter version of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>In 20 years these same morons will probably be hailing Ruhollah Khomeini and the real Nelson Mandela as &#8220;conservative&#8221; icons, while denouncing Winston Churchill as a vicious white supremacist.</p>

		<p>I see the BBC is just as unbalanced as the MSM is over here in the US. They allowed Griffin into the debates only because they were required to by law. The protesters outside are a bunch of kooks and wackos who serve the purposes of the BBC by making it look &#8220;balanced.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>But Mr Straw said when anybody put a specific quotation to Mr Griffin he tried to &ldquo;wriggle out of it&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p><i>Conservative frontbencher Baroness Warsi said Mr Griffin was &ldquo;a thoroughly deceptive man&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>Notice how this news piece doesn&rsquo;t even question why Griffin should be asked to defend old quotes of his that were taken out of context, and how it follows up every defense of Griffin with another criticism. The media knows it is so easy to slant any piece by carefully choosing who they quote, and by always allowing those they favor the last word. This is the trick they have used consistently for the last half-century to slant the news and mold public opinion.</p>

		<p>I watched this programme.  What a farce. A mainly hostile audience, but when he was allowed to finish an answer, he came across quite well.  Sitting next to him was the Chief Historian and Director of the British Museum - A Black American woman, Bonnie Greer.  I don&rsquo;t know much about her but she came across as an arrogant Afro-centrist.   When Nick Griffin started talking about the indigenous population who have lived here since the Ice Age, she went into a babble about there being no one here at that time in history and how people came here after the Ice Age, from the South, more precisely&hellip;Africa!  Oh how the audience and other panel members cheered and clapped! Jack Straw, a senior Labour politician pooh-poohed the idea of indigenous Britons, and Nick Griffin told him that he wouldn&rsquo;t dare go to New Zealand or America and tell Maoris or Sioux Indians they weren&rsquo;t indigenous.  Oh, how the audience mocked him! In answer to Nick Griffin&rsquo;s assertion that Winston Churchill would have been a BNP supporter, Bonnie Greer (again) said that there may have been some Mohawk ancestry in Churchill&rsquo;s mothers background, so he would have been unwelcome. The audience and panel members could barely contain their glee! </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the only questioner from the audience- or the panel- who came across as reasonable and fair minded was a Black man!  Watch it on YouTube or BBC iplayer. </p>
<p>Mind you its great publicity. I&rsquo;m listening to BBC Radio 5 Live, its all they&rsquo;re talking about! Its been all over the news all day, and the BNP has had 300,000 hits on their website today!</p>

		<p>Actually, the Maoris in New Zealand are not indigenous. They ate an earlier people called the Morioris. This doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the larger point of course.<br>

		<p>Jack Straw is one of those leftist pols who make a career out of calls to form commissions to look into police brutality and, what else, racism. His attack on Griffin and the BNP should be seen in that light.</p>

		<p>My question to these people would be - if the British, or whites in general, are not indigenous to the British Isles then who is?  We aren&rsquo;t indigenous to anywhere according to these people.  Why do so many whites go along with this?</p>

		<p> This was an out and out lynching. The entire tone was that of attacking Mr. Griffin M.E.P.  I&rsquo;m sure it was well rehearsed and would have gone off the same if he wasn&rsquo;t there at all. He did his best, but the set-up was too thourough. I would have liked for him to be less defensive. To not entertain such questions and to direct toward a discussion on policies. The BNP&rsquo;s policies are the only way to go if you are indiginous British. Without a doubt, there is a genocide occurring. Bloodless so far. </p>

		<p>The Question Time editors arranged this programme so that Griffin was given only a bare window of opportunity to state his policies and even then was rudely interrupted by one or several of the panel simultaneously practically every time he attempted to respond.  This tactic is not usually tolerated by Dimbleby, but on this occasion it overwhelmingly was for obvious bias reasons.</p>
<p>I would say that this programme was not about a serious and unbiased attempt to discuss the topic of immigration and asylum at all, but was about an opportunity to engage in a one-way name-calling and verbal abuse exercise as well as being used as an excuse to mock the legitimate views and deep concerns with regard to immigration, asylum and Islam, of the nearly one million people who voted for the British National Party.</p>
<p>In reality, it was also an attempt at actually stifling the free speech of a party and its nearly million native white voters and members, simply for standing up for the right to recover <b>their</b> ancestral homelands and to once again take charge of <b>theirs</b> and <b>their</b> own racial kin&rsquo;s destinies within them.</p>
<p>Ms Greer blatently denied that the white English, Irish, Scots, and Welsh are indigenous at all.  To deny a peoples their racial and cultural identities is surely a crime against humanity. </p>
<p>In view of the fact that the mainstream parties have now morphed into one of Marxist Liberal persuasion and to balance matters up, and level the playing field this time, what is needed is a native ethnoNationalist -v- Marxist debate hosted by the British National Party on its turf, replete with its own chosen audience and panel including just one typical Marxist Liberal all-parties representative.</p>
<p>By way of reciprocation in acknowledgement of the bravery of Nick Griffin to agree to appear on a programme hosted by one of the notorious anti-white racist media broadcasters, would any well-known figure on the Left be willing to meet the British National Party on the basis of the same criteria as the BBC laid out for its 22/10/09 Question Time edition? </p>
<p>They forget, the British National Party has the Internet, a media which is fast replacing the original printed and visual varieties. They also have their own camera team.  All that&rsquo;s needed is for just one such figure of note to be prepared to enter that other &#8216;Lion&rsquo;s Den&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

		<p>When on TV or radio, Mr. Griffin should simply state to the name callers that he understands they are calling him names because they have no way to counter the facts that he brings up. Works for me when I get in heated discussions with Red Diaper grandkids whose grandparents were busy wrecking Russia back in the day. All they can do is stutter and then call me more names. Just like blacks, latinos and most non-whites do. Mr. Griffen needs to play to the whites in the audience who are ready to pick up on his message. He doesn&rsquo;t need to try and come across as Mr. Nice Guy or worry about being called a &#8220;Nazi&#8221;. Whites who are ready will pick up on the truth. Worsening conditions guarantee it. </p>

		<p>AmRen readers should be aware that this program was precorded and the version of it that will be released will have been edited for &#8220;taste.&#8221; I think we all know that this will be a means by which Nick Griffin will be portrayed in the worst possible light. He should not have appeared on this program under these conditions. Nonetheless, good luck to him and the BNP.</p>

		<p>What is wrong with the people in Britain and the USA? Why can&rsquo;t they see what is happening to whites all over the world? Why can&rsquo;t these immigrants understand we don&rsquo;t hate them? We just don&rsquo;t want them flooding our countries and demanding rights at our expense. How does wanting to preserve our own race and contries make us haters and racists? What if the shoe were on the other foot? How would they feel if a majority of whites went to their countries and did to them what they are doing to us? </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel there is no hope for us. Not when our own people can&rsquo;t, or won&rsquo;t see what is happening. I&rsquo;m not sure what it will take for people to open their eyes and start fighting back.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here.  Check out how the BBC reported United States Soldiers fighting in the European campaign during World War II.  Slurs on their fighting ability and on their leadership.  Same type of reporting during the Korean War, the Americans cowards, the Brits holding back the hordes of Chinese.  The only thing our main stream media has learned is to emulate the BBC.</p>

		<p>This was indeed a tough fight for Nick Griffin. If I were in the audience, I&rsquo;d ask the panel&rsquo;s host how many questions had been posed to Mr. Griffin and how many he was allowed to answer. But, as The Independent put it, this was &#8220;Griffin&rsquo;s baptism of fire.&#8221; They were never going to make this easy, folks.</p>
<p>But this event exposed Griffin to a huge audience as he stepped through the flaming arches from the realm of the fringe into the arena of mainstream politics. With truth and justice on our side, we have no where to go but up. Our enemy knows this, and that is why they are the one&rsquo;s who are more afraid than Griffin in front of these hyenas. Take comfort in that.</p>

		<p>I just watched some of the selective links provided via this BBC site.<br>
It was like a selection of the winner fighters best hits.<br>
What a set up and an ambush, I think Nick Griffin came off well enough and he kept his dignity intact, which is better than I or any of the other panelists in his position could have ever done. <br>
But that was like watching a hostile intervention or a verbal lynching.</p>
<p>In fact the audience reminded me of the &#8216;traditional British&rsquo; (sorry I didn&rsquo;t mean to be politically incorrect there, I mean the pre-enlightened boring homogeneous British version of the..) &hellip;pantomime.<br>
And from listening to the the audience boos Nick Griffin was the Captain Hook or a Dastardly Dan type of character.<br>
That was a stacked deck and to be frank I think he was lucky to get of there.<br>
When he compared his fathers involvement in WW2 to Jack Straws and everyone went &#8220;Booo,&#8221; that&rsquo;s when I knew that Mr Griffin could do no good in that room and that the were not going to let him look good not matter what.<br>
They wanted Mr Griffin to lose it and look like an idiot and on that count they failed.<br>
But then they still have their very skewed version to present. <br>
And when would an audience of dark faces ever agree that England should be a White country when they themselves are the colonists, the tourists, the asylum seekers, the refugees, the interlopers, the genetic visitors, the immigrants, the over stayers or the invaders. <br>
And this &#8216;out of Africa theory&rsquo; makes Blacks think that they have a right to the whole World (lets see them try it in China), but yet we Whites have no rights in Africa hmmm how does that work?<br>
And I agree that having an Afro-centrist African American woman as the Chief Historian and Director of the British Museum, well says it all really.<br>
And they can rewrite history all that they want, but the fact is that 50 yrs ago Mr Griffin&rsquo;s views were very much what the mainstream public&rsquo;s views were, pre us all being taught to over ride and ignore our better instincts and the public themselves being changed. <br>
And when angry young Trevor Phillips clones <br>
( <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yl9nfkv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yl9nfkv</a> )get up to shout about their entitlements and then people answer for you, label you, constantly backtrack to make you look like a liar, put words in your mouth and then don&rsquo;t allow you to answer back properly then what can you do? <br>
And all of those dark skinned audience members talking in terms of their own self interests well &#8216;duh,&rsquo; but they always take this &#8216;all or nothing&rsquo; standpoint with diversity, in other words because &#8220;I&rsquo;m in fear that I may be deported from Britain though  I was born and educated here, we must keep the immigration flood gates open so more people (like me) who&rsquo;ll inevitably be pro-diversity and pro-immigration (like me) will make us an unstoppable numerically superior political force.&#8221;<br>
What that they don&rsquo;t realize is that the longer the flood gates are left open, the less comfortable their lives will become too.</p>
<p>And of the smug Whites sitting in the audience, of course they going to clap and go along with the flow, if anyone gave any support what so ever to the BNP they&rsquo;d instantly be labeled a racist themselves and then have to wear the scarlet letter.<br>
The sad thing is, I read the most well written and beautiful essays on line that have very credible points talking about the contradictions with Whites and non White &#8216;rules&rsquo; and how we too do have some entitlement ourselves, but then you get people like Mr Taylor or Mr Griffin who go in Television and they&rsquo;ll have &#8216;accused Racist&rsquo; or the qualifier &#8216;self proclaimed&rsquo; Race Realist or something to that effect in the introduction or as the banner label, so all of those fine sentiments verbalized become &#8220;blah, blah, blah&#8221; to good old Joe public. <br>
And then this is within a literal sea of media choices.<br>
I was reading about certain political events that conspired in the late 1940&rsquo;s (I won&rsquo;t get into specifics) but back in Britain there were newspaper headline posters everywhere and it would have been on the wireless too no doubt, and the result was rioting in the streets with buildings being attacked etc. due to angry public sentiment. <br>
Now look at our public, it would hard to a room full of people who&rsquo;d agree on anything and we are drowning in this world of &#8216;too much information.&rsquo; <br>
It&rsquo;s hard to get angry when your local outrageous stories are lined up all of those from around the world daily, it all becomes relative and &#8216;just another brick in the wall.&rsquo; </p>
<p>When basketball playing Obama (&#8220;who me&#8221;) won the Noble peace prize, to be honest my first instinct was that I just wanted to head for the hills and leave everyone behind, that audience gave me the same feeling.<br>
Everyone is so smug in their indoctrinated views, it&rsquo;s very hard and very brave to go against the majority, we used to value that, these days though if you&rsquo;re not a sheep then you&rsquo;re evil.<br>
I hope Mr Griffin learned from this experience and is better armed for next time and was not too deterred, considering the environment he did OK.</p>
<p>Here is an unrelated link that was on the side of the page from above that I&rsquo;m just throwing in here.<br>
&#8216;Emma Thompson accuses Rwandan son&rsquo;s university of being &#8216;too white&rsquo;<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzpruor" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzpruor</a><br>
&hellip;.who&rsquo;s side are these people on?<br>
They would say that there are no sides or that they&rsquo;re &#8216;on the side of good,&rsquo; but really all that they do is attack Whites and wish to replace us with Blacks. <br>
To me, it makes them the enemy and simply supporters of the &#8216;Dark side.&rsquo;<br>
There&rsquo;s no loyalty anywhere anymore.<br>
(Sorry I&rsquo;m such a wind bag and not very concise.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh how the audience and other panel members cheered and clapped! Jack Straw, a senior Labour politician pooh-poohed the idea of indigenous Britons, and Nick Griffin told him that he wouldn&rsquo;t dare go to New Zealand or America and tell Maoris or Sioux Indians they weren&rsquo;t indigenous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of Maoris, in New Zealand there is an ethno-centric party called the Maori Party, which of course isn&rsquo;t labelled as racist by the MSM. </p>
<p>However, one thing the BNP could learn from the Maori Party is to open up its membership to mixed-race citizens or citizens of other races. While the Maori is Maori-centric it can&rsquo;t really be called racist because it doesn&rsquo;t have a racist membership policy. If the BNP did the same then technically it couldn&rsquo;t really be called a racist party.</p>

		<p>Nick Griffin is a great man.  He is a courageous man, a man I admire and respect.</p>
<p>I will say this about that panel and audience.  They are self-hating White men and women of Britain for the most part.  It would not surprise me that the composition of that audience was chosen specifically based on their political leanings. That Black British guy in particular. It seems everywhere and I mean  </p>
<p>EVERYWHERE -</p>
<p>I watch sporting events, TV shows, newspaper advertising,<br>
EVERYWHERE we see Black men, they&rsquo;re almost always depicted in close proximity to a White woman or women.  This is for a specific purpose and that is none other than to acclimatize our women to &#8220;getting it on&#8221; with them and to accustom society to see White women with Black men even if they&rsquo;re not &#8220;together&#8221;.  These relentless images of Black men with White women put the suggestion subliminally in White women&rsquo;s minds to get together with not only Black males but any male who is non-White.</p>
<p>But once again we should praise Nick Griffin for his courage and relentless determination in standing up to these people in the cause of Britain and White people.</p>

		<p>The problem that the main establishmnt as is being proven by the increasing BNP popularity, with its web-site receiving many more hits than all the other Parties web-ites combined in the last year or so.  The British public in the front line is very worried about the experiment foisted on them by the establishment and is now realising that and wanting to now what the BNP has to offer, and likes what they see, the opposite of what is going wrong in Britain.   While British whites can be arrested for th most trivial of perceived racial &#8220;crimes&#8221;, Muslms can parade i the streets booingreturning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan and demanding the heads of them as well  as saying on poster/placards that Sharia Law is coming to Britain.   And te so called moderate Muslims in Britain say that they are the foibles of a few radical Muslims but do nothing to stop them, even allowing them to preach in the Mosques, many more of which are being built around Britain.<br>
And the descent of Britain&rsquo;s young into drug and alcohol binge drinking deparvity will encourage the Muslims to offer salvation to Britain&rsquo;s young looking for a way out of thsi sad situation.  Hence the gradual take-over of the West by religious fanatics.  History tends to repeat itself as Europe had such problems and settled them a few hundred years ago.</p>

It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

		<p>I know Nick Griffin is regretting having ever gone on this program.  The  deck was stacked against him before he even entered into the studio.  There was never anything in store for him other than what he got.  It was impossible for him to in any way go against the popular trendy idea of massive immigration and muticulturalism. He was at a severe disadvantage in a serious way before he even opened his mouth to utter his first word. That is what he was up against and what those of us who feel that massive immigration and multiculturalism is a death sentence for western society.  It never ceases to amaze me how many whites come out with such passion in favor of these two things.  They completely and utterly turn a blind eye to the hostile actions and rhetoric from ethnocentric groups and individuals but target members of their own race like Nick Griffon who advocates over the long run course what is best for indiginous ethnic britons.   </p>

		<p>Interesting that the rioters in the streets outside the BBC who attacked the police, wounding three of them, were &#8216;civilised&rsquo; nice protesters and NOT from the nasty BNP!! The news broadcasts of these riots were very carefully edited to screen out the many howling blacks and muslims in the mob and show only whites which was a dead giveaway considering the racial make-up of the actual audience inside. I was a little disappointed with Griffin&rsquo;s performance as he should be quite used to this type of organised humiliating style of interrogation and should have diverted many of the scripted questions back onto the questioner who would not have been groomed to debate properly. Several members of the audience were angry because their own questions about MP&rsquo;s expenses or the postal strike were not permitted to be directed  to others on the panel but this was an obvious deliberate ploy to use the BNP as a very convenient deflector shield for Jack Straw et al. Never mind, still more publicity for the BNP as our General Elections are due next May. There should be very telling local results as this is where the strengths of the BNP lay rather than international waffle such as greenhouse gasses which are always screened on the BBC with a backdrop of harmless water vapour wafting gently from power station cooling towers which have nothing whatsoever to do with the topic but look good on TV to any gullible brain-washed audience, just like BNP bashing!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some pretty offensive remarks over the years but Ms Greer&rsquo;s statement that native Brits have no special claim over their country is the worst. She seems to be relying on the &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; theory to suggest that Africans have a right to drift anywhere they damn well please since everywhere else in the world is fair game. The racist arrogance is breathtaking.</p>
<p>Greer was being very slippery in not counting the last glacial period as an ice age. As I understand it, it wasn&rsquo;t an ice age in strict geological terms, but Nick Griffin&rsquo;s use of the term was reasonable in the context.</p>
<p>This wretched novelist is now Deputy Chairman of the Trustees of the British Museum. Why?</p>

<p>These same cultural relativists have no problem at all deciding who is white when it comes to &#8216;positive action&rsquo; programs, and (during their brave efforts getting to the real hidden-truth fighting against all odds) at fingering those responsible for all oppression in the past and all evil&rsquo;s continuation into the future. </p>

		<p>I thought Nick did well when discussing immigration and foreign policy. The endless attacks, by foreign ethnics, came across badly although Nick also came across badly when they drudged up stuff about his past.<br>
As I have said before the BNP have an important role to play and I wish them well but the party who have the potential to institute immigration reform and repatriation is UKIP. Lord Pearson is set to become the next leader and he is the one who invited Geert Wilders here and knows what needs to happen. UKIP have their faults but they real chance of being our Freedom Party and winning 30%-40%-50%+ of the vote we require.<br>
As last night showed as powerful and right as Nick Griffin&rsquo;s arguments are on immigration he is ultimately hamstrung by his past.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sitting next to him was the Chief Historian and Director of the British Museum - A Black American woman, Bonnie Greer. I don&rsquo;t know much about her but she came across as an arrogant Afro-centrist. When Nick Griffin started talking about the indigenous population who have lived here since the Ice Age, she went into a babble about there being no one here at that time in history and how people came here after the Ice Age, from the South, more precisely&hellip;Africa! Oh how the audience and other panel members cheered and clapped!&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it then follow that whites are actually African, and so it must be that what we call colonialisation should just be considered a return to our homeland. If whites are African, then why was it so wrong of us to hold power there, in our ancestral home?</p>
<p>Oh, and she is on the British Museum&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, but she&rsquo;s a playwright, not a historian.</p>

		<p>They showed this on the news here in Australia, only a couple of brief snippets from the show, all of which made Griffin look horrible. It&rsquo;s a disgrace the way they handled it, nothing short of an attempted public lynching. It will be interesting to see how many people saw it that way, and how opinion polls will change (if at all). Could go either way, I think.</p>
<p>I do hope that now the BNP has its first appearance on that show out of the way, the BBC and other media have no excuse to deny them further future appearances, at least while they have representatives in various forms of government.</p>

		<p> There were no substantial issues addressed on BBC&rsquo;s Question Time. The whole program was devoted to well rehearsed attacks on Mr. Griffin by hostile minority audience members and the other politician panelists. Evidently, no one is allowed to stand up for the rights of the indigenous peoples of Great Britain. Rational discussion of the ethnic and religious transformation of Great Britain is considered off limits by the privileged elites. Moreover, Mr. Griffin is not a one party fascist and yet the demonstrators against him are called &ldquo;anti-fascists&rdquo; by the controlled media. </p>

<p>Be bold, go on the offensive - turn the tables on these white race hating, white race genocide promoting Cultural Marxists.  Ask them why only WHITE nations are supposed to allow themselves to be invaded and swamped by millions of non-whites?  Ask them to explain WHY whites are supposed to not object to their being displaced and dispossessed in their native lands?  Ask them why whites should not be concerned about being transformed into a minority in their own homelands and then find themselves subjugated to rule by a new non-white majority who will most certainly be hostile to everything they hold dear?  </p>
<p>  Ask them if they understand the official 1947 definition of the crime of Genocide, as codified by the Convention on the Crime and Punishment of Genocide.   If they try to avoid answering, then read to them the precise definition of genocide - hammer them over their evil heads with it.  Pro-white advocacy groups and parties, like the BNP - could easily put together radio spots and include the recitation of the official definition of Genocide.  </p>
<p>Corner these destructive and evil people; put THEM on the defensive, make them try to justify genocide of every White majority nation&rsquo;s founding stock.  </p>

Howerver,for me the highlight and the most appalling moment  was when a blonde girl from the audience said that we all come from Africa and therefore all people in the UK was therefore inmigrants. Simply disturbing<br>
This sadly mirrors the state of affairs all over Europe<br>
Also,it was really sad listening to further comments from the attending brainwashed whites.<br>
Finally, I think this was a step forward and an encouraging move for all white nationalist parties in our beloved, but sick Europe.Keep Going!</p>

		<p>The below piece of news was taken from the BNP website.It includes Mr Griffin views on the event.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The staggeringly biased lynch mob Question Time broadcast on BBC 1 has turned into the single biggest recruitment night in the British National Party&rsquo;s history, with no fewer than 3,000 new people registering to be signed up as members when the current recruitment freeze ends.</p>
<p>This figure represents the single largest block of new membership expressions of interest ever, and will, once formally signed up, have boosted party membership by nearly 30 percent.</p>
<p>The BBC broke every rule in its book, even changing the format of the show to allow a hand-picked mob to use up the entire hour to relentlessly attack BNP leader Nick Griffin. Even the supposed moderator, David Dimbleby, joined in the attack, refusing to allow Mr Griffin to answer a single question in full  &mdash;  despite letting other panellists ramble on for minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said this morning that he was going to submit a formal complaint and a Freedom of Information Act request to have the preparatory papers for the show exposed to the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we will see that the BBC not only changed the format of the show, but that the questions were primed to be a barrage of lies disguised as statements,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>The normal format of the show is to discuss issues of the day. Last night&rsquo;s show was merely a prepared bear pit with a hostile hand-picked audience and panel, exactly as Mr Griffin had earlier predicted it would be.</p>
<p>At one stage, the &lsquo;moderator&rsquo; allowed three highly charged questions in a row attacking Mr Griffin. When the BNP leader started to answer the first one, Mr Dimbleby interrupted and refused to let Mr Griffin continue his answer or even begin to answer the other two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People wanted to see me and hear me talking about things such as the postal strike. One or two questions about what a &lsquo;wicked man&rsquo; I am, fair enough, but the whole programme, that was absurd,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>In addition to the complaint he would be lodging over the show, Mr Griffin called for the entire event to be &ldquo;done again. But let&rsquo;s do it properly this time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said the viewing public had tuned in, wanting to hear the BNP&rsquo;s policies and views on immigration, the postal strike, the illegal war in Afghanistan and other issues of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead they got none of that, merely a list of statements, almost none of which were even questions,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could also sit and prepare an hour of statements about other panel members if given the opportunity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could say that Mr Jack Straw was a member of the Young Communist League as a student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could say that &lsquo;Baroness&rsquo; Warsi has never been elected to anything and was told to stand down in Dewsbury by her own party because they wanted a white person as candidate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to abuse the public broadcaster to do that, they would squeal like pigs. Yet this was exactly what was done to me,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>He added that the programme should have been filmed somewhere else because London was &ldquo;not my country any more. Why not come down and do it in Thurrock, do it in Stoke, do it in Burnley?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it somewhere where significant numbers of English and British people still live, somewhere where they haven&rsquo;t been ethnically cleansed from their own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said that the biased nature of the programme was obvious to all viewers and that this would generate further support for the BNP as it was now clear to all exactly how the other parties gladly teamed up against him.</p>
<p>* The BBC said it had received more than 350 complaints after the show was broadcast by midday today  &mdash;  the bulk of which accused the show of being biased against the BNP and/or Mr Griffin.</p>
<p>* £5,300 was raised in donations over the party&rsquo;s web site. This does not include the call centre, whose figures are not yet available. The combined hit rate climbed to just over 15 million for the past three days. The Alexa web ranking for 20 October placed the BNP website as the 11,468 most visited site in the world, a number which will certainly climb as the figures are updated.<br>

 I watched the first five minutes, then turned off as it was an obvious set up. The giveaway was the first questioner, who said that &#8220;the majority of this audience don&rsquo;t agree with you&#8221; now how would he know that unless it was a set up?<br>

But people like Emmma Thompson evidently  existed as long ago as  Dickensian England  after Bleak House and the &#8220;Mrs Jellybeas&#8221; character, who spent all her waking time worrying over the poor blacks of Africa, even as her own family were going through the most terrible suffering and hardship.

		<p>One man asked Mr Griffin: &ldquo;Where do you want me to go? I love this country, I&rsquo;m part of this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did Mr. Griffin answer him?</p>
<p>Whites have been told to get out of everywhere.  In the U.S., Hispanics have said this many times, publically, and in the media.  (Whites in the U.S. have been driven out of many cities and regions, this is well known).  It especially is repeated on line, via blogs and discussion panels.  Whites should go back to Europe, they say. Blacks in Africa tell whites to go back to Europe, and there isn&rsquo;t much room for a white non-Muslim in the Islamic world. Shouldn&rsquo;t then Asians and Blacks be directed, when asked, back to the lands of their actual ancestry?  Cannot a white even use this piece of crystal clear logic?</p>
<p>The final question will come to that, and Mr. Griffin is right to begin, even in this hostile setting, to purvey the idea that there is a such thing as the Indigenous European.</p>

		<p>I watched this programme in despair. Nick Griffin was subjected to non-stop personal vilification from beginning to end, including at the hands of the show&rsquo;s supposedly neutral moderator, David Dimbleby. He was there not to contribute, and to state his case, but to be interrogated. (Unsurprisingly, his answers were never considered good enough.) The whole format of the programme (normally individual responses to questions about current-affairs topics fielded by members of the studio audience) was altered to become a barrage of innuendo and abuse against the BNP in general and Mr Griffin in particular.</p>
<p>The studio audience was disproportionately composed of ethnic &#8220;minorities&#8221;, but as a poster on another web site commented (and I noticed this, too) there was also an extraordinarily high proportion of very attractive young women there. This poster suggested very plausibly that the idea behind this was to suggest subliminally to men that such women would be unlikely to find them attractive if they were BNP supporters (since these same women were shown applauding the anti-BNP set pieces enthusiastically).</p>

  &mdash;  - I mentioned in #21 that White women are usually displayed with or near Black men.  The emotional Black man who confronted Mr. Griffin was surrounded by pretty White women.  I believe this was part of the &#8220;set-up&#8221;.  Of course as I mentioned before this is depicted in the MSM everywhere in the US, that is, White women with non-White men.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly surprising. The audience was deliberately rigged against him. This is quite common anytime a White person, who is a public figure ie. politician etc., stands up for their own ethnic group. Sadly, the biggest protestors are Whites themselves. Of course is Hispanics or some other group does the exact same thing, everyone including Whites, applauds. </p>

		<p>Peter Hain is a example of someone who has little business interjecting his opinion on the matter. He spoke out on how awful apartheid was in South Africa as a teenager but abandoned the country to live in Whiter Britain. Now he&rsquo;s trying to destroy Britain! He might better spend his time contemplating the money he ripped off from the British public as part of the expenses affair. He was the first to resign Brown&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>

		<p>Those who noticed the audience was &#8220;stacked&#8221; are correct. Same thing they do in the US. That way the pro-white guest will have every statement shouted down with boos and catcalls, with the string-pullers hope the viewing audience will forever associate with anything pro-white. </p>

		<p>Yes I saw this spectacle in full. Amazing. How could the white British people not know their own history? It is surely well recorded. There were native tribes before Caesar arrived in 60 BC.<br>
These celtic tribes led by the Iceni tribe warrior queen Boudicca almost drove the Romans out c60 AD. If any country has a well documented history of where their people came from it is England, Scotland, Wales, etc. The Celts once populated most of what is now Europe, and here their last stronghold is being decimated.</p>
<p>What are they teaching in the schools there. I just can&rsquo;t fathom how the obvious isn&rsquo;t so&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..obvious.</p>

		<p>We all came out of Africa? We all came from chimps? We all came from primordeal ooz? The big bang? Many things in the remote past are possible but whatever it was&hellip; whites didn&rsquo;t stay there. There is nothing to be arrogant about but I&rsquo;m satisfied with not only where we EURO&rsquo;S came from in the recent millenia but perhaps more importantly what came from us&hellip;&#8221;The modern world&#8221; As I see it the real racists are the ones that demand to live with us and suck the life out of us on economic, social and genetic levels. At the most basic level the racial antagonism is born of the fact that non whites want white genes and whites are not interested in the trade!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen parts of the program, and whether anyone here thinks that Nick Griffin did well or poorly, or whether the audience was stacked against him and the BNP or not, is totally immaterial.  I draw ironic parallels between &#8220;Question Time&#8221; here and Jared Taylor&rsquo;s debates with sundry Aztlan-on-the-brain reconquista nuts, many of which are viewable here on AR&rsquo;s website/blog.  Jared Taylor ALWAYS wipes the floor with them when it comes to facts, reason, evidence and logic.  But will it matter in the long run?  Demography is destiny.  A hundred years from now, after the last white family is &#8220;feet don&rsquo;t fail me now&#8221; being driven out of the American Southwest by Hispanic crime, gangs and possibly irredentists, they&rsquo;ll all agree with each other that they&rsquo;re glad that Jared Taylor won all those debates back in their great grandkids&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>Similarly, Nick Griffin doesn&rsquo;t need to win debates.  All he needs to do is show up, be white, and don&rsquo;t make an obvious fool of himself.  He&rsquo;ll win hearts and minds.</p>

		<p>Griffin us under tremendous pressure, of course,  the powers that be are tying to shuffle him into a jail cell,  that&rsquo;s what happens to people who dissent in Western &#8220;democracies&#8221;  .   But his tactics are terribly weak stuff.  There is only one way to beat the left and that is to turn the entire Nazi/anti-racism propaganda leviathan against them.   Make them live up to their own standards.   In this country the formula is:  Liberalism is American Nazism,  white people are its victims, and the Democratic party is its political home.  Chant it like a mantra,  and let it be the anchor of all political debate with the left.   The proper answer to his attackers would be something like &#8220;You call us Nazis for what you imagine we might do in the future,  but it&rsquo;s not the BNP that is sponsoring  the ethnic cleansing of our cities, it&rsquo;s not the BNP that is running a program of racist colonialism against the British people and nation,  and it&rsquo;s not the BNP that enables large-scale racist violence on the streets by ignoring it when whites are its victims.     There is one difference between you and the Nazis though,  as far as I know Hitler and the Nazis never had a plan or even a desire to exterminate the British people,  but Labour does.&#8221;</p>

		<p><b>Cherry picked audience</b></p>
<p>The Jewish schoolboy Joel Weiner who asked Mr Griffin about the Holocaust, confirmed that he applied to attend a Question Time programme more than a year ago, but was approached just 24 hours before filming.</p>
<p>The BBC denies cherry-picking activists or potential troublemakers and said that those selected came from a database only containing those who had applied to go on the show before Mr Griffin&rsquo;s appearance had been confirmed.</p>
<p>However an Asian man, Khush Klare, who was given free rein to attack Mr Griffin, said in the media that that he had not even applied to be on the show  &mdash;  and had been approached to do so &ldquo;only a couple of days before the show.&rdquo;</p>
