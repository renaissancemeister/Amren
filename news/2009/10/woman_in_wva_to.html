<h1>Woman in W.Va. Torture Case Now Says She Lied</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Breen, Yahoo! News, October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black woman whose racially charged allegations of horrific abuse helped put several people in prison now says she lied when she alleged she was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and tortured in a ramshackle West Virginia trailer.</p>
<p>West Virginia authorities said in 2007 that Megan Williams, now of Columbus, Ohio, had been stabbed, beaten with sticks, sexually assaulted, doused with hot water, forced to eat animal feces and taunted with racial slurs by seven white men and women. She later said that hot wax was poured on her and that two of her captors had forced to drink their urine.</p>
<p>An unsigned statement released Wednesday by the office of her Columbus lawyer, Byron L. Potts, said simply, &#8220;Megan Williams is now recanting her story.&#8221; Williams was scheduled to attend a news conference Wednesday in Columbus along with Potts.</p>
<p>Brian Abraham, the former Logan County prosecutor who pursued the cases, expressed skepticism that the story was a lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&rsquo;s going to say that she made it all up, that&rsquo;s absurd,&#8221; Brian Abraham told The Associated Press Wednesday. &#8220;This looks like another attempt to generate more publicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abraham said police and prosecutors realized early in the case that they couldn&rsquo;t rely on statements from Williams, who tended to embellish and exaggerate details.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, the seven people were convicted based on their own statements and physical evidence. All seven pleaded guilty, and all but one were sentenced to long prison terms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reactions from people who supported Williams were guarded Wednesday, as advocates talked cautiously about a young woman whose mother once described her as &#8220;slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did have some concerns about what was being done at the time and how it was carried out by Megan and the family, because of her mental condition,&#8221; said the Rev. Audie Murphy, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Logan and Boone counties.</p>

		<p>Keep someone sitting up in a hard chair long enough.  Shower them with enough threats and lies.  Maybe even take the phone book or a rubber hose to them and you can get most people to confess to just about anything.    Remember the cops are not your friends.  Never tell them anything more than your name and that you want your lawyer.</p>

		<p>This story was all over the news a couple of years ago, but now I only see it on Amren.  </p>
<p>It is disgraceful for the prosecutor to now admit that the police and he could not rely on testimony from his own witness because she tended to embellish and exaggerate.  That should have been taken very seriously and it is grounds for not prosecuting.   He now again dismisses his own witness as a chronic publicity hound.  He wants it both ways.  He want us to believe her testimony about being abused by whites, but in the very same breath he says she is not credible on any thing she says.</p>
<p>As for saying they were convicted on evidence; no, they were convicted because they pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain.  He seems a bit confused on this.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors just about always overcharge the accussed and then they offer a plea bargain in exchange for a much reduced sentence.  That is what most likely happened here.</p>
<p>It might be hard for people to understand why someone would plead guilty to something if they are innocent but it is actually more common than people realize.  </p>
<p>It is especially common when dealing with a kidnapping charge.  Most people think of kidnapping as holding someone for ransom, but actually any time you detain a person against their will, you might get charged with kidnapping.  The prosecutor has a lot of discretion in this, and it allows them to threaten the accussed if they did in fact detain a person against their will.  So if they fought with the woman over money and detained her for any reason they might get accused of kidnapping.  So now the prosecutor can say to the accussed you will get twenty years for kidnapping, but if you admit to a string of other charges as well, we can reduce the whole sentence down to ten years.   </p>

		<p>Most white-on-black &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; are hoaxes. The only thing different here is that the truth came out. </p>
<p>I recall in 2003 there was national outrcy over a black woman at the University of Virginia who just happened to be attacked by a white man as she was facing a student president election. She just happened to have been attacked at 2:00 a.m. while going to her car and there just happened to be no witnesses. There just happened to be no suspects and she just happened to have been a campus race activist.</p>
<p>Hate crime hoaxes against whites are one of the biggest trends in the U.S&gt; but only AR ever writes about them.</p>

		<p>This is a clear case of &#8220;railroading&#8221; some poor white people with no connections or clout.  This is what black groups say always happens to them, but in this case it actually is true.  These people couldn&rsquo;t afford any real counsel and were pressured to confessing, that much is obvious.  This prosecutor needs to be thoroughly investigated by the State Attourney.  At the very least the wrongly convicted will receive new trials.  </p>

<p>You remember correctly: https://tinyurl.com/yhc8lq3</p>
<p><b>To see the real truth of the matter, let us take a look at the Department of Justice document Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2005.  </b></p>
<p>In Table 42, entitled &#8220;Personal crimes of violence, 2005, percent distribution of single-offender victimizations, based on race of victims, by type of crime and perceived race of offender,&#8221; we learn that there were 111,590 white victims and 36,620 black victims of rape or sexual assault in 2005. <br>
&hellip; In the 36,620 cases in which the victim of rape or sexual assault was black, 100 percent of the offenders were black, and 0.0 percent of the offenders were white. The table explains that 0.0 percent means that there were under 10 incidents nationally. </p>
<p>The table does not gives statistics for Hispanic victims and offenders. But the bottom line on interracial white/black and black/white rape is clear: </p>
<p>In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. </p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. <br>
 <br>
No wonder there was such absolute belief in the guilt of the Duke students among the leading sectors of liberal America. &hellip; There are virtually zero rapes of black women by white men in the United States, and half of all rape charges against specific individuals turn out to be false. </p>

		<blockquote>Remember the cops are not your friends.</blockquote>
<p>I agree. Andy Taylor is ancient history and we are now a full-blown anarcho-tyrannical police state. Law enforcement is no longer on the side of decent citizens  &mdash;  and especially not on the side of decent <i>white</i> citizens. Just look at the Martha Stewart fiasco. When it was found that she did nothing illegal in the stock market, they then railroaded her for lying to them during their original attempt at railroading her for insider trading, which she was not guilty of. If she had simply invoked her right to remain silent and demanded an attorney the first time the authorities came snooping around, she never would&rsquo;ve been in any trouble. </p>
<p>Now, I realize that Stewart is a Clintonite liberal, and thus probably loathed by most who post here, but that&rsquo;s beside the point. The point is, if the criminal justice system will do this to such a bland, conformist establishmentarian as Stewart, then just imagine what they will do to a citizen who shows any real anti-establishment tendencies. (Actually, you don&rsquo;t have to imagine, google Peter McWilliams.) </p>
<blockquote> Never tell them anything more than your name and that you want your lawyer.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this also. And I would add that just before you tell them you want a lawyer, you should also tell them that you do not consent to any searches. In my opinion, it would not be an exaggeration to state that 90% of people who are incarcerated in this country are incarcerated because they talked when they didn&rsquo;t have to or they consented to searches that they didn&rsquo;t have to. Also, in most states, unless the cops have reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that you have broken the law, you do not even have to tell them your name.</p>

When I was working as a doorman bouncer, my partner was a guy with a somewhat (self proclaimed) shady past. One thing that made me laugh, then think, was a policy he had. He ALWAYS carried his passport with him, and it always had two valid visas to countries with no U.S. extradition. He also claimed to have 90% of his money in Emeralds and the means to conceal them on his body.<br>
  Funny then, but serious now. He could do what people with child care and custody cases against them would be well advised to do. Flee the country without even having to return back to the apartment&hellip;</p>

		<p>If I remember the original story one of the whites had actually been dating this black woman before the incident happened so I doubt if this was a hate crime. They were all on drugs and none of them would have been mentally competent. These are the type of white people we don&rsquo;t need anyway and hopefully they won&rsquo;t be able to breed any more morons in prison. </p>
<p>This should be a lesson to everyone, stay away from drugs and stay away from black people. </p>

		<p>It is FACT that police can lie, make false accusations and DO WHATEVER IT TAKES to &#8220;extract&#8221; a &#8220;confession&#8221; whether true or not.  Any methods can (and are) used to make people &#8220;confess&#8221;.<br>
I would like to se it LAW that ALL interrogations are RECORDED and made available to defense teams.  This could do much to eliminate false confessions.</p>

		<p>I DID see this article elsewhere, and it made an interesting statement.  The girl when recanting stated her MOTHER made her &#8220;enhance&#8221; the story dramatically for purposes of publicity and future financial gain - i.e. to be able to publish the story, and sue the &#8220;offenders&#8221;.  Interesting that since she&rsquo;s recanted, there is NO attempt by Gov to review the case, or throw it out.  You can BET if the races were reversed, the Gov would be scrambling to free those convicted on false testimony as soon as they could.</p>

		<p>From an Oct. 20 report in the West Virginia Gazette:</p>
<p>&#8220;Six days after Williams was found, [prosecutor] Abraham met with NAACP and black church leaders to discuss hate-crime charges in the case.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I remember specifically telling them, &#8216;Look fellas, be careful how far you go out on this limb, you may get sawed off. Be careful of what she&rsquo;s saying and what her family is saying,&rsquo; Abraham said.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the North Carolina NAACP&rsquo;s going  &#8220;far out a limb&#8221; in the Duke lacrosse case. From: UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case<br>
by Stuart Taylor, Jr. and K. C. Johnson (BookTV.org video presentation, September 11, 2007)<br>
<a href="https://www.booktv.org/program.aspx?ProgramId=8608&amp;SectionName=&amp;PlayMedia=No" rel="nofollow">https://www.booktv.org/program.aspx?ProgramId=8608&SectionName;=&PlayMedia;=No</a> </p>
<p>KEY EXCERPT: </p>
<p>Taylor: &ldquo;What you would hope might come of a case like this is that the NAACP of North Carolina, for example, seeing what has happened to black people like the Scottsboro boys many times in the past  &mdash;  and not only that long ago, seeing that the criminal justice process is often unkind to innocent black people even when there isn&rsquo;t terrible abuse by the prosecution, &hellip; seeing all this &hellip; what an opportunity to establish a coalition of people against abuse in the criminal justice process &hellip; to build a cross-racial coalition for serious reforms of, say, the grand jury process to make it a real safeguard &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it didn&rsquo;t happen. The local NAACP and other local black leaders  &mdash;  enough to be a critical mass  &mdash;  basically crusaded to attack the lacrosse players. They joined the mob. They misrepresented the truth regularly, repeatedly, and grossly. They supported the rogue prosecutor long after he had been proven a rogue prosecutor. They threw away the opportunity to build that cross-racial coalition and they threw away whatever shreds were left of their own credibility.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>What makes these people&rsquo;s &#8220;confessions&#8221; more valid than this woman&rsquo;s lies? Seems like a textbook case of prosecutorial abuse. Prosecutors pile charges on top of charges until the suspect is looking at spending the rest of their life behind bars. Then, the prosecutor makes them a &#8220;deal&#8221;, whereas if they &#8220;confess&#8221; they will get out in &#8220;only&#8221; ten years. This happens all the time. Prosecutors love it because it gives them a guaranteed win without having to spend a lot of time on the case.  </p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s interesting that Megan Williams said she was &ldquo;pressured&rdquo;  to testify against the white defendants. The white man she was dating was a low life and did beat her. However, she admits that she made up the parts about being made to eat feces, being stabbed, imprisoned, raped etc. I believe her retraction as she now faces perjury charges. </p>
<p>When this was &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; was announced the university where I work went into PC overdrive with demonstrations, &ldquo;take back the night&rdquo; marches, sensitivity training, etc. etc.etc. I&rsquo;ve yet to read about this new development in the case in either the local paper or student paper. </p>
