<h1><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/167425.php">Black Cancer Patients Less Likely Than Whites to Receive the End-of-life Care They Prefer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medical News Today, October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study of racial disparities in end-of-life (EOL) care revealed that black cancer patients&rsquo; treatment preferences were less likely to be observed than were white patients&rsquo; preferences, according to researchers from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>Some black patients who had opted not to be resuscitated or put on a ventilator in a life-or-death crisis received the treatment anyway, and died in an intensive care unit. Conversely, white patients who had expressed a preference for aggressive care in end-of-life discussions with a doctor were three times more likely to receive it than were black patients who had voiced the same wishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;End-of-life care discussions appeared to be more effective in ensuring that white patients&rsquo; treatment preferences were honored,&#8221; said Holly Prigerson, PhD, senior author of the report in The Journal of Clinical Oncology. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not saying that black treatment preferences were ignored,&#8221; she emphasized. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the white patients who reported the completion of a do-not-resuscitate order, or a DNR, order at baseline subsequently received intensive care in the last week of life,&#8221; said Prigerson. &#8220;This did not prove to be the case for black patients. DNR orders did not significantly protect black patients from intensive end-of-life care in this study.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the black-white disparity in adherence to advance directives may be linked to gaps in communication, some of which resulted from discontinuities in care that may have been more prevalent in the treatment of black patients.</p>
<p>For example, the researchers identified a few instances where DNR orders completed for black patients fell through the cracks because their informal caregivers (friend or family member) changed over the course of their illness, or because a critically ill patient was treated at a different hospital from the one that normally provided their care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The researchers, including lead author Elizabeth Trice Loggers, MD, of Dana-Farber and scientists at several other institutions, interviewed 234 white and 68 black patients with advanced cancer. The initial interview included questions about the patients&rsquo; preference for end-of-life care; the level of trust in their physicians; whether they had had an end-of-life care discussion with a doctor; and whether they had completed a DNR order. The patients&rsquo; informal caregivers were interviewed separately.</p>
<p>Each patient was monitored until their death, which on average was 3.5 months later. A patient was considered to have received intensive end-of-life care if he or she had undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or been placed on a ventilator in the last week of life, followed by death in an intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks tended to prefer intensive end-of-life care, were less likely to report that a DNR order was completed for them, and much more likely to be &#8220;positive religious copers&#8221; believing that their outcome would ultimately be determined by God.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>What sounds like a miscarriage of medicine could all be explained by Blacks inability to complete an end of life document prior to their final admission to the hospital. But to get your article published in any Medical Journal coming out of Boston you have to show how minorities are routinely mistreated, undertreated, forgotten, or taken advantage of by the white majority. Otherwise your research will end up on the editors&rsquo; circular file.<br>
    Hospitals target white families to stop expensive treatment so the hospital can absorb more profit from the DRG payment by medicare. Blacks simply don&rsquo;t trust the hospitals and doctors and prefer to let nature decide.</p>

		<p>There is a very good reason for this. Health care professionals know that, regardless of the  wishes of the patient, if they do NOT apply every conceivable life-extending measure the deceased patient&rsquo;s relatives have won the ghetto lotto. They will be sued for everything they own or ever hope to earn. They will be hounded from their job with the slander that because of racism they let a poor, helpless African-American die without doing anything to save him/her. No one is going to take that chance. Of course now there&rsquo;s living wills and so forth, they have it made, no matter what a doctor, hospital or clinic does, they will be wrong. Move to a majority white area where you won&rsquo;t get tangled up in this sort of no-win situation. </p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  The general level of chaos is far greater in black folks&rsquo; lives; it stands to reason that that level of chaos would continue to the end of their lives as well. </p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t be the only white person who frequently has trouble understanding what black folks are saying.  In my job it isn&rsquo;t life or death, which we can all be grateful for, but for those whose jobs depend on communicating with blacks every day, I have nothing but admiration &amp; pity.</p>

		<p>White people are more likely to have solid jobs, have health insurance, and practice preventative care.  Black people are more likely to not have jobs, have no insurance, be a drain on our medical system, and not take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Meh from what I learned from from talking to a medical malpractice attorney is that there is no legal claim for &#8220;wrongful life&#8221; so some doctors just ignore living wills, DNRs etc. and do whatever they can to save a patient. You can&rsquo;t bring suit for saving your life as far as I am aware.</p>

		<p>Blacks in their own cultural ( ? ) counties receive what kind of tribal care in contrast to the White man&rsquo;s Western medicine ? What would be their preference if given an educated choice ?</p>

		<p>To Michigan Patriot:</p>
<p>African dictators want to spend the rest of their days receiving medical care in a Western country ratther than their own. Mobutu Sese Seko died in Switzerland or France, I believe, rather than be treated by a Zaire shaman. Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea, died in a Cleveland hospital. He had ruled Guinea since its independence in 1958, but didn&rsquo;t trust anyone in his own country.</p>
<p>I guess if they &#8220;went under the knife&#8221; in a local hospital, they&rsquo;d bleed pretty bad. And, it would be fatal.</p>
