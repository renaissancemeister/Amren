<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1008/p25s02-usgn.html">Mississippi Mandates Civil Rights Classes in Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carmen K. Sisson, Christian Science Monitor, October 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most Mississippi children have never heard of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black child whose 1955 lynching in Mississippi by a white mob galvanized the civil rights movement. They haven&rsquo;t heard of the 1964 &#8220;Freedom Summer,&#8221; when 1,000 volunteers swept into this area to register black voters. They don&rsquo;t know about ordinary citizens who faced extraordinary odds to bring change.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re going to know all about it soon. In a groundbreaking reform  &mdash;  believed to be the first in the nation  &mdash;  Mississippi will require civil rights as part of its US history curriculum. McComb schools made that move in 2006; but starting next fall, the stories of the civil rights era will be taught  &mdash;  and tested  &mdash;  in all public schools.</p>
<p>In many places, it will end a decades-old culture of silence. People here don&rsquo;t like to remember the nights of church bombings and explosions; the sound of rifles being loaded in the dark as citizens patrolled sidewalks and sanctuaries, trying to stem the violence. They don&rsquo;t like to remember the fear and distrust  &mdash;  between blacks and whites, but also among themselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mississippi Senate Bill 2718, passed in 2006, mandates all kindergartners to 12th-graders to be exposed to civil rights education. In the younger grades, students will read books such as &#8220;I Love My Hair!&#8221; as a way to discuss concepts like racial differences in skin complexion and hair texture. Later grades will delve more deeply into how ordinary citizens shaped the civil rights movement and the long-term effects those changes had upon the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Spears says the new curriculum is being taught this year in 10 pilot programs. Teacher workshops begin this month, taught by the state Department of Education in conjunction with the Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy at Jackson State University, Teaching for Change in Washington, and the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi.</p>
<p>Mandating the new curriculum was the only way to ensure it would be taught, says Spears. It&rsquo;s not that teachers haven&rsquo;t wanted to teach civil rights, though he admits that&rsquo;s probably the case in some places. It&rsquo;s more a symptom of a nationwide problem, an educational stricture some say is an unwelcome byproduct of the No Child Left Behind Act: Teaching to the test. As the stakes become higher, the curriculum narrows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WHEN EDUCATORS BEGAN ASKING these questions, they sought inspiration in the McComb High School classroom of teacher Vickie Malone. Three years ago, when she began teaching &#8220;Local Cultures&#8221; as an elective to seniors, she had no idea what the course would become. She just wanted her students to hear all the voices of history, both black and white, taught in an open way that promoted understanding, not fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted them to understand choices, and how profoundly they can affect the rest of your life,&#8221; Ms. Malone says. &#8220;A lot of kids today are just numbed out, but back then, the kids were the movers and the shakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Indeed, in 1961, 300 students walked out of Burglund High School to the McComb City Hall in support of voting rights  &mdash;  116 of them were jailed.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The class is fashioned more like a college seminar than a high school elective. There are no rigid rows of desks, multiple-choice tests, or rote memorization. Instead, students gather at a table to talk about issues that even their grandparents and parents  &mdash;  some of whom were participants on both sides of the civil rights battles  &mdash;  may have difficulty discussing.</p>
<p>In one class last month, they examined dual perspectives, and each student wrote a poem from two angles, examining life through the eyes of another. There were the expected combinations: Popular/unpopular, rich/poor, white/black. But there were surprises as well, and as they read their work to their peers, there was occasional muffled admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa,&#8221; a student said, after one reading. &#8220;That&rsquo;s deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And ultimately, say proponents of the curriculum changes, that&rsquo;s the goal: Making Mississippi&rsquo;s future better, even if it means dredging muddy waters.</p>
<p>DR. SUSAN GLISSON, director of the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi, spends a lot of time thinking about this, analyzing where the state has been and where it&rsquo;s going. Pockets of progress are punctuated by serious challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kids are practically being funneled from school to prison,&#8221; Ms. Glisson says. &#8220;When you throw in a failing economy, terrorism, fears of wars abroad, and the first African-American president, you have a potentially dangerous situation. It requires us to be as vigilant as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In McComb, the curriculum change has sparked a storm of controversy. In his Aug. 29 editorial, &#8220;A Relevant Subject,&#8221; McComb Enterprise-Journal editor and publisher Jack Ryan tried to allay fears that kids will be force-fed a message of &#8220;white people bad, black people good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says the issue &#8220;cuts too close to the bone.&#8221; When officials began talking about teaching civil rights, they discussed omitting McComb church bombings. In 1984, when the newspaper published a 20-year anniversary &#8220;Freedom Summer&#8221; report, a white employee told him she wished they&rsquo;d &#8220;just leave that stuff alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those feelings are echoed in public comments posted on the paper&rsquo;s website below Mr. Ryan&rsquo;s editorial.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t imagine what this course will accomplish other than to open old wounds, some of which aren&rsquo;t healing well as it is,&#8221; says one poster.</p>
<p>But Spears says that&rsquo;s why Mississippi should pioneer civil rights education: &#8220;It&rsquo;s not over, and that says a lot about what this state can potentially become. We do struggle, and out of necessity, we can&rsquo;t just stand pat with the challenges we face.&#8221;</p>

<p>I will not teach lies, half truth, or propaganda about the civil rights movement nor revisionist history about fairy tale minority heros to young people.</p>
<p>The diversity class I was forced to take as an undergrad was an abomination of lies and twisted views and too many teachers who know this stuff is wrong continue to teach it just for a paycheck. Not I.</p>

		<p>This shows that the communists have taken over all the educational systems so thoroughly, that they cannot be challenged. Most of the people whom promote such programs have be so brain washed, that they cannot see the logical consequences of their actions. They think that they are making up the so called wrong doings of a past era, that has been taken out of context, exaggerated, and lied  about.  Because of group think, and the fear of losing friends, fear of losing your job, Also, appearing being hateful. They go along with these suicidal policies. It is just survival action in living in a multiracial state. Ignoring the crime, and the social decay. And, the eventual end game is being conquered by an outside force through surrender. The lost of history, the unique character, and strong social norms that are needed to keep society healthy, together, and enduring.<br>
A society of slaves are being created by the ruling class. Dumb,<br>
uneducated, and whom just follow orders into the new world order.</p>

Beware of unindented consequences. There&rsquo;s not telling how this is going to go badly but it will.</p>
<p>One scenario is that it just fuels black resentment while white students learn how much black people today are NOT victimized by &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What whites will learn is that, maybe the past was bad for blacks but all that is over. Blacks don&rsquo;t have any excuses for their failures other than themselves.</p>
<p>While black kids will be flaunting their victim-hood, white kids will be rolling their eyes and saying, &#8216;get over it&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>God pity the poor parents of the kids in that state.  Their kids are going to be brainwashed until their heads are filled with nothing but useless junk.</p>
<p>The one thing the simple-minded multicults are doing, but don&rsquo;t realize it, is keeping the racial differences open and ongoing.  That&rsquo;s about the only good that will come of all this.</p>
<p>No white kid should be schooled anywhere other than home.</p>

		<p>Parents must demand that if civil rights studies are mandated, what has been given to blacks in the way of Affirmative Action, welfare, food stamps, government set aside contracts, quotas, etc. must be taught.  Let students learn how much money has been spent on blacks since Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society and compare that with the results of blacks since then in terms of crime, education, illegitimacy, etc.</p>

		<p>Public schools are nothing more than indoctrination centers. They don&rsquo;t even attempt to hide their agenda, anymore. Ask any school-age kid what he knows about Martin Luther and he&rsquo;s sure to go into a disjointed ramble about a black civil rights leader. Pathetic.</p>

		<p>Angry White Dude, I&rsquo;m one of the commenters on your blog! Though I won&rsquo;t disclose my identity here, you may be able to guess based on my arguments. I absolutely agree that whites need to start making demands and waves of their own. As long as we continue to accept the notion that whiteness is horrible and blacks are perfect angels, then we will continue to be displaced in a slow but sure manner. Only through white unity, white pride, and the willingness to take action will we end this assault on white people</p>

		<p>Good for you Connor. I really would like to see a school voucher program implemented that forces public schools to compete with church schools and private schools for the voucher money for it would change education in this country dramatically. You could teach the truth again and get paid for doing so. </p>

<p>Good post! Such vicious anti-white propaganda is hard to stomach but it will certainly play right into the hands of the white advocacy movement. We should remember that direct contact with non-whites and all their nutty ideas is the surest way for minds to be changed.</p>

		<p>Till wasn&rsquo;t lynched by a mob, he was shot by the husbands of the two women he committed a low-level sexual assault against.   Nor was he killed anywhere near Bryant&rsquo;s Grocery &amp; Meat Market.   The author doesn&rsquo;t have even the basic facts right,  the facts don&rsquo;t really matter to her.   It&rsquo;s odd how the left blatantly distorts the facts of the case and persists with the &#8220;whistling&#8221; myth,  after all they could still make the case that the murder of a 14 year old (and the subsequent acquittal of his killers)  for this low-level assault was a gross injustice.  Perhaps they fear that if they told the truth about the case it would diminish the sympathy for Till by reminding whites of the epidemic of black-on-white sexual assaults that has exploded in this country since the 1960s,  and reminding them as well of the thugishness and boorishness of young black males in general.  </p>

<p>Ive been sick and tired of these things since I found out about it back in 1992..when the first black President [Clinton] went in (or around about that year)&hellip;&hellip;and Ive noticed it getting alot worse than it was back then&hellip;(Im 40)&hellip;</p>
<p>With all of the sickening slobbering and adulating worship of the blacks get what else could we expect??&hellip;..Its a government education policy&hellip;I saw it back in my Daughters middle school 4 years ago and thats when I pulled her out of government education, and now my Wife homeschools her&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Is this story making blacks out to be victims in yet another way even as they mandate change? As if students aren&rsquo;t Already being taught the proper &#8216;history&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Americans, and indeed the world, is so steeped in this blacks-as, of all things, victims, even bringing up the idea a white person somewhere might be a victim of something is the greatest &#8216;insult&rsquo; today. I guess the &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; folks can&rsquo;t keep two idea&rsquo;s in their heads at the same time. When someone, anywhere, white and male, is held up as a victim somewhere, either individually or as a group this is often seen as &#8216;Nazilike&rsquo;. Their &#8216;open&rsquo; minds must in fact be quite full of something already. The objections are complete. So, maybe it is Nazilike to make someone a victim, at least if you notice it&rsquo;s being being done. Something they seem quite, quite dedicated, to the exclusion of all else, in doing. Frankly, I wonder if there will ever be a way to end this victims as supreme mentality?   </p>

		<p>I think teaching children about the crimes committed against blacks 60 years ago needs to be put into proper perspective.  It needs to be balanced with all the horrific and depraved criminal acts and ongoing crimes being committed by blacks today, as well as for the last 60 years.    </p>

		<p>Was it Renan who wrote, &#8220;Nations must forget as well as remember, in order to remain a nation&hellip;&#8221;? Whether this claim be true or not, popular African-American leadership demands that any and all healing injuries be scored, and that that pain be used for even more aggressive pursuit of power and vengeance. They have the enthusiastic support of the &#8220;music&#8221; industry and the mainstream media.  The issue of this compound is a folk-frenzy.<br>

		<p>What this boils down to is that in Mississippi, too many blacks and whites are getting along too well.  We&rsquo;re far too nice to each other. That will never do.  Actual racial harmony thwarts the hidden agendas of too many entities.  The black kids have to be taught to hate us.  This new program is all too much like the Antisemitic &#8216;education&rsquo; the Nazis and certain others &#8216;provided&rsquo; for the children of Germany and Poland.  You see how that turned out.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that for the exterminations of Tutsis in Rwanda to take place, the Hutus had to be thoroughly taught why Tutsis were evil.  That took quite a few years.</p>
<p>Fifteen years from now, when we&rsquo;re being dragged from our homes, the powers that be do not want sympathetic black and brown soldiers to show us any mercy.  So those future soldiers have to be taught, from Kindergarten on, that White People are demons.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that most of the these kids who will learn all about the civil rights movement and black history won&rsquo;t be taught about John Locke, David Hume, Edmund Burke, Henry David Thoreau, Albrecht Duerer, Socrates, Plato, or countless more European men (and women) who have influenced Western civilization, science, and arts.</p>
<p>And those that they do will be demonized like Thomas Jefferson (he was a slave owner, remember?) or dumbed down like Issac Newton (he was a polymath who invented calculus and many other ideas, yet most high school kids probably think he was some dead white guy who &#8220;invented gravity&#8221;).</p>

		<p>Plenty of states have &#8220;civil rights&#8221; history embedded in US history. Some high schools have African American history. The problemm is that the American Revolution, The Constitution, The Pilgrims and Jamestown, the Civil War, western expansion and capitalism and immigration other than Latino influz aren&rsquo;t being taught in depth. </p>

<p>I came in here to post exactly this. Sure, let&rsquo;s teach the facts about what happened back then. But let&rsquo;s also teach what has happened since. Speak the truth, and let the chips fall where they may. A truly honest telling of facts won&rsquo;t be very flattering to blacks.</p>
<p>And along the same lines, let&rsquo;s teach the truth about black invention myths. Namely, that most of the rubbish trotted out during black history month is a pack of lies, and that blacks have invented virtually nothing of consequence. (For anyone reading who doubts this, do a google search for &#8220;black invention myths&#8221;.)</p>

		<p>Yet another reason to home school. Education has been taking a back seat to propaganda for some time, so this law per se is nothing earth-shattering, but maybe those white parents who haven&rsquo;t been convinced yet to get out of the system will be persuaded to do so now.</p>
<p>If we could only get the Religious Right folks who are so concerned about sexual purity to take some thought for racial purity as well &hellip;.</p>

		<p>I also could teach History or English in the United States but prefer to teach foreign languages since at least there is not a brainwashing factor in this and I don&rsquo;t have to go against my principles to make a living.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this individual choice of mine doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that at some point the white youth are going to have to become as racially aware and proud of their heritage as the other minorities in the country. This will of necessity come about as numbers continue to shift over the next several years, and it may come even sooner if we see this false economic recovery turn into a full scale depression or hyper-inflation.</p>
<p>These &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; programs going on all over the country, in more or less extreme form depending on the locale, are only possible because whites of European background are the only ethnic group which is not allowed to be proud of its past accomplishments. As a result, programs like the one being developed in Mississippi are for the South simply part of the &#8220;Reconstruction&#8221; going on since the end of the segregation laws of the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s, and I see it more as a &#8220;mopping up operation&#8221; than anything else. The damage was already done by the late 1960&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see whether it&rsquo;s finally time for a white counter-revolution to restore matters to where they should be. Maybe this Mississippi program will not be &#8220;crammed down the throats&#8221; of the students there as easily as is hoped for by the &#8220;educators&#8221; involved.</p>

		<p>I took a diversity class the last year of college.  What a bunch of anti-white propoganda!  I&rsquo;m glad many of the students in our class didn&rsquo;t fall for it. When I do have kids, they sure as hell are going to be homeschooled!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Civil Rights&rsquo; has actually come to mean &#8216;Black Preferences&rsquo;. If it&rsquo;s added to the curriculum, it will still be required in home schooling. The only difference will be that the parent will have the opportunity to teach the actual truth; not just the spin version.</p>

		<p>Instead of saying &#8220;they lynched a black men in 1912&#8221; or &#8220;discriminated against them&#8221;, let&rsquo;s hear from the anti-civil rights side why it was done.  While I&rsquo;m sure there were whites who killed blacks just because they were black (which I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t condone in the least bit), I can&rsquo;t believe that every single time a black person was lynched by whites was out of bigotry or hatred.  That just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  </p>

		<p>Rest assured, if these classes are anything like the Diversity Drivel that White Fortune 500 Company employees are force to go thru- the up and coming generation of White Folk will be the most racially aware in a century.</p>

		<p>Before any child is indoctrinated into what &#8216;racism&rsquo; is, they should receive a solid education about races, genetics, and the history of the various world peoples.</p>
<p>Teaching students lessons about &#8216;racism&rsquo; is handing them their opinions, rather than letting them sift through the facts and determine their own.</p>
<p>Some of the conclusions a child may reach, after studying the various races, is that all are not the same. They would then, according to orthodoxy, be holding a &#8216;racist&rsquo; viewpoint, albeit one derived from rational observation and study.</p>
<p>Schools are doing a disservice by telling kids the &#8216;right&rsquo; and &#8216;wrong&rsquo; with regards to ideas about race. It&rsquo;s a multi-faceted issue with many emerging areas of scholarly inquiry.</p>
