<h1>Veiled Muslim Woman Says Shopkeeper Turned Her Away</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Douglas, WFAA-TV (Dallas-Ft. Worth), October 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Cooper Street Farmers Market sits in a highly diversified community in central Arlington  &mdash;  a tossed salad of cultures, colors and accents.</p>
<p>But when Latifa Aimaq went into the market, she found trouble from the proprietor.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very intimidating. He began to yell: &#8216;Get out! Get out! Get out! We don&rsquo;t allow people with a face veil in here!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aimaq covers all but her eyes and hands in when in public, but signs posted in the market say faces must be visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to explain to her it&rsquo;s for our safety and the safety of our customers,&#8221; said store manager Chris Perez.</p>
<p>Perez said women in full veil rarely come in, and usually when they do, they discreetly show their faces to his mother. But Perez said there were no women working the day Latifa Aimaq came in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez disputed that account. &#8220;Muslims are probably 40 to 50 percent of my business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not turning them away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terence Ali, a frequent customer at Cooper Street Farmers Market, overheard the explanation from Perez and joined in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Latifa Aimaq is urging Muslims and others to boycott the store. She said she has never encountered hostility at an airport, bank or the department of motor vehicles, where she does discreetly reveal her face when the law requires.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aimaq is an English teacher at an Islamic school and says she covers for modesty.</p>
<p>Chris Perez says he wants to honor her beliefs and customs if she will honor his store rules.</p>
<p>After all, Perez says  &mdash;  he needs her more than she needs him. &#8220;In today&rsquo;s economy, why would I turn down anybody&rsquo;s money?&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you go into a bank with a full face mask on, they will call the police. Calling a mask a veil shouldn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there will be a lawsuit and the store will be forced to close. </p>

		<p>Aimaq v. Perez - the irresistible force meets the immovable object. Which oppressed minority will win this one?</p>
<p>In this kind of case, the remedy at common law is not to require specific performance. There are lots of other shops she can give her business to. And she *can* shop there if she&rsquo;s willing to be reasonable and dress like the majority of the natural-born population.</p>
<p>Of course, she&rsquo;ll probably file a discrimination complaint and cost this guy a zillion dollars, especially once someone from the ACLU or the SPLC hears about it.</p>

<p>Will the fight go the distance? I see you are going with the aggrieved Muslim over set upon Hispanic. Interesting choice. Muslims have proven to be the best fighters of late. </p>

		<p>NOBODY should be allowed to routinely walk around in public with their face concealed. If only for reasons of public safety. Imagine being able to walk into a bank or jewelry store with a skimask on. I&rsquo;m surprised bank robbers haven&rsquo;t caughten on to this veil/burka thing yet.</p>

		<p>At a local pawn/coin shop, they don&rsquo;t even allow people in to the store who are wearing hoods, let alone someone covering their entire head.</p>

		<p>If you walk into my credit union with any one of these items  &mdash;  hoodie, sunglasses, hat  &mdash;  you are asked to remove them. Not kidding. I went in on a bad hair day with a cute straw hat, and it had to come off. </p>
<p>Who the heck do these people think they are?</p>

		<p>At least she can&rsquo;t charge this poor fellow for being a racist, which would certainly be the case if he was a White store owner.  </p>
<p>With all the rampant crime these days he is entitled to exclude people with covered faces for security reasons, especially if he posts a sign telling patrons of his store policy and the woman, being an English teacher, certainly was able to read it.</p>
<p>Sadly though, once the ACLU takes up her case, it is all over for him. Maybe if he is really lucky, some creative robbers wearing those beekeeper outfits stick up a store nearby and make a clean getaway. That would certainly bolster his defense!</p>
<p>I was recently in a coin shop and could not get my foot in the door without removing my dark sunglasses. So it is a valid security concern and I respect that, but Mr. Perez is just an ordinary schmuck without the resources to fight this. I don&rsquo;t think this woman would have the nerve to try to go up against some sort of major institution.</p>
<p>She always has the option of taking her business some place else.</p>

		<p>Any bet takers that this &#8220;muslim&#8221; is just a silly American black convert who can now add the violation of her religious civil rights to increase her chances of winning the ghetto lottery. SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Anonymous #1 is correct, there WILL be a lawsuit/out of court settlement and Latfia will win because muslim+black beats Hispanic in the ghetto lottery. </p>

		<p>There are laws in several states that prohibit one from engaging in a public protest with one&rsquo;s face fully concealed.  They were mainly passed to head off that K-organization.  Why the very same people who thinks those laws are a good idea aren&rsquo;t wanting to apply them to burquas is beyond me.</p>

		<p>This is a toughie: Who will prevail?  Both are takers from the system and dependent on such, so I believe we can discount the effort and issue of being resilient.  I am laying odds on the Muslim to triumph.  After all, Mr. Perez was not nice, and God forbid, intimidating.  Also, Mr. Perez is already beginning to back down by making excuses for his actions.  &ldquo;The Cooper Street Farmers Market sits in a highly diversified community in central Arlington &mdash; a tossed salad of cultures, colors and accents.&rdquo;  Oddly enough, Mr. Perez is getting a good dose of diversity being our strength with the tossed salad of cultures, colors, and accents.      </p>

		<p>In NYC it is illegal to wear a mask yet you see these terrorists covering their entire faces&hellip;even their eyes in some situations.  We don&rsquo;t even know if they are female.  Strangely, this is legal but wearing a mask is not.</p>

		<p>Hey, this gives me a great idea!  I&rsquo;ll dress up as a Muslim lady and become a stick-up artist!  And if I get caught I&rsquo;ll claim I&rsquo;m a Muslim cross-dresser who&rsquo;s been denied gainful employment, cruelly driven to a life of crime by intolerance.</p>

		<p>In the deepest depths of my soul I cannot fathom the way this country is virtually prostituting itself for everyone other than those loyal citizens who built and advanced it. It seems that we are so consumed with not &#8216;offending&rsquo; anyone who doesn&rsquo;t belong here or have any fidelity to our country that we are offending everyone who DOES belong here. It&rsquo;s insanity.</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s not that the average person is consumed with politcal correctness, it&rsquo;s the media doing this. They keep reporting on the story. It&rsquo;s their way of batting us over the head with P.C.</p>

		<p>I was asked today to remove my cap when I entered a Wachovia bank branch.  A baseball cap.  My face was totally exposed. I was told this was a new policy as some branches had been robbed recently.  A covering of any sort is going to become less and less acceptable in the current age.  Looks like every non-white has learned how to whine these days.  Whining is a sign of immaturity.  Think about it.</p>

<p>It is in large part due to the security cameras, other people may see your face clearly at eye level but the cameras are angled down and hats obstruct the view of the face.</p>
