<h1><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,651989,00.html">Germany&rsquo;s &#8216;Brown Babies&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Siek, Spiegel, October 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For many of the now-adult children of white German women and African-American GIs, adopted by families in the United States after World War II, the search for the truth has been difficult. Online communities are helping.</p>
<p>Rudi Richardson knew something about what it meant to be a black man in the United States. But after being deported to Germany, the country where he was born, shortly before his 47th birthday, he had to start figuring out what it meant to be black and German  &mdash;  in a land he barely remembered and whose language he didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>He started life as Udo Ackermann, born in a Bavarian women&rsquo;s prison in 1955. His mother, a Jewish woman named Liesolette, was serving a prison term for prostitution. His father, whom he never met, was an African-American serviceman named George. Rudi was given up for adoption.</p>
<p>Like thousands of other postwar children with black GI fathers and white German mothers, Richardson was raised by an African-American military family in the US. He has spent his life trying to find where he fits in.</p>
<p>Born in an era when Germany was still grappling with its responsibility for the Holocaust and when the US Army had a policy of not acknowledging paternity claims brought against its soldiers stationed abroad, some of these children were put up for adoption in the United States. At the time, Germany judged itself incapable of absorbing these &#8220;brown babies&#8221;  &mdash;  as they have come to call themselves. In the late 1940s and 1950s, efforts were made to match them with African-American military families, many of whom were stationed around Germany at the time.</p>
<p>Forbidden to Speak German</p>
<p>The adoptees grew up in the United States, many with no idea they were adopted or that they were half-German. Scattered across the country, many of the children were forbidden to speak German in their new homes. At the time, it was believed that continuing to speak German would damage their ability to learn fluent English.</p>
<p>After a stay in a German children&rsquo;s home where he says he suffered sexual and physical abuse, Richardson was adopted by a military couple as a toddler. After a few years living on base in Germany, the family returned to the US. It was about that time, Richardson recalls, that his adoptive mother began a downward spiral of alcohol addiction and mental illness.</p>
<p>Richardson was 17 when his parents finally told him he was adopted. He was sitting across from a probation officer following an arrest for joyriding  &mdash;  and he was given a choice: face the charges in court, or join the Army. Eager to be away from an increasingly unhappy home, Richardson chose the latter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he discovered his adoptive parents had never had him naturalized as a US citizen. He says he was told he&rsquo;d get citizenship automatically after being honorably discharged from the Army, but it never happened. This caused problems for him three decades later, when he was deported to Germany in 2003 after spending time in prison for drug possession and petty theft.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Totally Spooked&#8221;</b></p>
<p>His arrival in Germany was a &#8220;horrible experience,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;There were three policemen waiting for me, and they escorted me out of the plane to the police station in Frankfurt. They interrogated me for two hours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The police said that I had to tell them every crime I had committed in the United States. They told me they could convict me under German law.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was spooked, so I told them everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He counts the next 18 months in his &#8220;native land&#8221; as among the worst in his life. He was often homeless, suicidal and had resumed abusing drugs, including cocaine. One of the few positive experiences he remembers was meeting other black Germans through the Initiative Schwarze Menschen Deutschland (Initiative for Black People in Germany, in German only). The group was founded in the mid-1980s as a forum for people of African descent in Germany and a way to fight racism.</p>
<p>Not all of the children fathered by black GIs were adopted by American families. Although a 1968 study estimated that up to 7,000 black German children were adopted by Americans, many others remained in Germany with biological relatives or as wards of the state. Some of them, like writer Helga Emde and artist Ika Hugel-Marshall, went on to found the Afro-Deutsch movement in the 1980s, raising their voices in literature and the media after years of being statistically invisible and yet uncomfortably conspicious.</p>
<p>But for many black Germans raised in the US, it was the rise of the Internet that sparked their awakening. It connected them to information about their parents and helped them find a common identity. Web sites became a supranational meeting point, a place where black Germans could meet others who share similar experiences.</p>
<p><b>Not the Only One</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Many of us never knew we were adopted, and many of us thought we were the only one,&#8221; said Rosemarie Pena, who was adopted as a two-year-old in 1958. She recalled feeling that she was &#8220;different&#8221; as a child in a way she couldn&rsquo;t quite pin down. Pena was 38 when she found out that she had been born in Germany. She said her subsequent search for biological family, and for others like her, is about knowing her own story and being able to share it with her descendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can leave them [her children and grandchildren] a legacy and a history that I didn&rsquo;t have. They need to see me as a victor, and not a victim,&#8221; Pena said.</p>
<p>Pena&rsquo;s Web queries led her to an Internet group of German adoptees of all races called Geborene Deutsche, and then to a e-mail list called &#8220;Black Germans.&#8221; When its administrator stepped down, Pena volunteered to run it, and she now serves as president of the newly incorporated Black German Cultural Society.</p>
<p>Pena used her skills as a Web designer to expand the Black German Cultural Society from an e-mail list to a full-fledged Web site and social network at BlackGermans.us. The community has nearly 200 members on both sides of the Atlantic, adoptees and non-adoptees. A spinoff site, Black Germans in Education, launched in April.</p>
<p><b>What it Means to Be Black and German</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important for me to find a way to engage both sides  &mdash;  the Germans who remained in Germany and those who went to the States,&#8221; Pena said.</p>
<p>The community offers a place to parse what is often a difficult history  &mdash;  of unknown parentage, half-remembered faces and questions about being black, or German, and what it means to be both.</p>
<p>Members of the Black German Cultural Society can post old photos in the hope that others can identify the subjects and help locate a long-lost mother, father, or sibling. There are subgroups according to interest and background: Black German Cooks; Black, German and Jewish. There&rsquo;s a group for bloggers and another for people trying to learn (or relearn) German.</p>
<p>The organization also engages a search consultant, Henriette Cain, to help people looking for their birth families. It&rsquo;s a process Cain is familiar with, having undertaken it herself. She counts herself as extremely fortunate: Not only did she locate her birth father and mother, but she has reunited with her biological sister, who was adopted into a German family, and three half-brothers born after her biological mother married and moved to the States.</p>
<p>So far Cain has helped more than a dozen adoptees find birth family members with help from several Internet databases and online genealogy resources. When she hits a wall  &mdash;  or just wants feedback on some ideas, she can log on to BlackGermans.us and post a message in the forums.</p>
<p><b>A Yearning for Answers</b></p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re scattered all over everywhere. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to come together in one place, in a brick-and-mortar place. And we&rsquo;re so busy, with the modern world, and we just don&rsquo;t have the time,&#8221; Cain said. But with online forums, &#8220;At 2 a.m. you can go and write someone and have an answer by 6 a.m.&#8221;</p>
<p>A similar yearning for answers and companionship led Daniel Cardwell to launch his Web site, GrammerChildren.com, in 2007. It aims to tell the story of a subset of adoptees, who were brought to the United States by an African-American journalist and socialite named Mabel Grammer. Grammer had moved to Germany with her soldier husband, and began volunteering at local orphanages where she discovered dozens of &#8220;brown babies.&#8221; Grammer began matching some of the children with African-American adoptive families.</p>
<p>But Cardwell, who is writing a book about his experiences, has learned that his own story is not that simple. Brought to the United States as a four-year-old and adopted by an African-American couple in Washington D.C., he was raised believing that he was a very light-skinned black man. It was not until he began trying to find his biological parents as an adult that he discovered his mother was a half-German refugee from Poland, and his father was native Hawaiian who was classified as &#8220;colored&#8221; by the military because of his skin color.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been run out of white people&rsquo;s houses: &#8216;Who&rsquo;s this black person you&rsquo;re bringing in here?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been run out of black people&rsquo;s houses: &#8216;Who&rsquo;s this white person you&rsquo;re bringing in here?&rsquo;&#8221; Cardwell said of his adolescence and early adulthood. &#8220;There is no belonging, which is what brown babies sought most.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;A Sense of Identity&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>For Rudi Richardson, online communities have given him a outlet for his autobiographical poetry, which deals with themes of loss, alienation, healing and hope. The Internet also led him to Heide Fehrenbach, a historian who has studied black Germans and how race is viewed in Germany. She put him in touch with the Black German Cultural Society, which Richardson said is an important reminder that there&rsquo;s a place where he belongs, regardless of what country he&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me a sense of identity,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;It brings me to my roots. I could just feel it in my soul, that I&rsquo;m not alone. That these guys have similar experiences, and they&rsquo;re beautiful people. And we are a part of history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once Richardson had finally secured his German citizenship papers, he left almost immediately for London, using his new status as a European Union citizen to secure residency there in 2005. He had decided that his prospects in Germany were dim. Despite his efforts, he couldn&rsquo;t master German well enough to get a job, and he said that white Germans he encountered couldn&rsquo;t look past his brown skin to give him a chance.</p>
<p>He has been clean for three and a half years. In 2007, he founded a nonprofit called Streetlytes, which provides assistance to homeless people in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m helping the marginalized,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m helping the people who have issues with being rejected by family, being abused. That is where the healing is, for me and for them. And that is what I will continue to do for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me.  The continuing (but gradually ending) American occupation of West Germany at first and eventually all of Germany is happening at the same time, and for many of the same reasons, that Germans have harbored a lot of racial self-guilt.  It is not surprising that many German women would take up with black American GIs.</p>
<p>I do know that some American blacks stationed in Germany are on the German welfare systems.</p>

<p>This is exactly why that Justice of the Peace will not marry interracial couples. The only hope these mixed people have is if everyone mixes and has brown babies.</p>

		<p>I had a weird law school lecture in an international law class about these German Africans once. If I recall, most of this interracial marriage stuff was caused by the fact everyone in Germany was starving after it was ravaged by the Allied forces, marrying a GI, even a black, was the best way to keep food on the table. </p>
<p>Most of these women tried to get out of their marriages once things started to improve, and tried to get annulments on the grounds that interracial marriage in the soldiers home states like Alabama, Arkansas etc. Of course the occupying forces did not allow this though. (I forget what the technical reason for not allowing annulments in this situation was).</p>

		<p>I had a relationship with a German-black woman who came to this country when she was 3. She used to look WAY better than Halle Barry or Beyonce,and I am not lying, but no more.She was the most unpredjudiced person that I ever met.She lived on Potrero Hill, near the black projects.She seemed to get along with blacks, whites, and everyone else.Sad to say, her drug use and contracting HIV totally wrecked her.</p>

		<p>This is the worst thing Hitler did to Germany.  He insisted on a fight to the bitter end, turning against the people he led into the abyss.  And so in the ruins of Germany, German women were forced to latch onto their former enemies, regardless of their color, in order to survive.  I don&rsquo;t think that many German women escaped rape (especially in the east) and prostitution later on.</p>

		<p>Regardless of any crimes committed he was born the son of a US citizen.  He was adopted by US citizens.  Her served in the US Army.  Deporting a 47 year old man to a country he didn&rsquo;t remember is cruel and bizarre.  A woman can sneak across the border 2 minutes before giving birth and that child is a citizen and that woman would never be deported.  Mexicans get arrested over and over for drunk driving and do not go to prison, let alone get deported, until they kill someone.  And even then they may not be deported.  This country is a total disgrace.  He may not have been a star citizen but he is one of ours and like it or not we should be responsible for him, not Europe!  Just like MEXICO should be responsible for MEXICANS.  Deporting that man was a violation of any degree of decency.  I am disgusted.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s changed, but when I was in the Army in Germany (1974-5) it was very common for the black GIs to have white German girlfriends.  Some of the women even had German husbands <i>and</i> black GI boyfriends.  Interestingly, the influx of migrant Turks was also beginning to become noticeable; they worked the lower paying jobs.  German&rsquo;s had a saying, &#8220;Never trust a Turk.&#8221; But I guess they had no problem, at least the women, abandoning their natural race and culture in favor of the black Americans.  It must have driven the German guys insane.</p>

<p>Any White woman or man who betrays their own race (especially with blacks) is not what we should ever condone or accept as &#8220;normal&#8221;. It is NOT normal or moral. How will any race survive and continue if we accept it all? Are we all to be one mixed up racial soup?  Not I&hellip;..</p>

		<p>It is my contention that the majority of white females are hard wired to betray their own racial stock without the heavy hand of  patriarchial control.  Perhaps all women are hard-wired like this, but white women in particular seem to be the most aggressive in their actions&hellip;they seem to thrive and revel in it. </p>

		<p>Another reason to bring the troops home and dismantle the empire (besides war being the ultimate racket). The military has always been a corrupting influence on the local culture; note the abundance of tattoo parlors, bars and brothels just outside nearly any overseas base. I doubt if the Founding Fathers had this kind of thing in mind when they opposed the existence of a standing army in peacetime, but it&rsquo;s mighty relevant anyway.</p>

  As an American Military Man with service in Germany recently, I can tell you that German women run to black soldiers in large numbers.  </p>
<p> If you&rsquo;re a black US Military guy over there, you have absolutely no problem having a bevy of German women to pick from.</p>

		<p>The military is probably a good example of a controlled experiment with human beings as can be practically achieved. Everyone gets the same training, working conditions, rules, and pay.  There is some pre-screening and a large population to evaluate as well.  </p>
<p>Given these factors, the behavior of most black American servicemen in Germany in the 1970&rsquo;s were far different than the whites.  The blacks presented the greatest discipline problems, and were far more violent.  They were also known for blowing their paychecks on the loose women in town who were low enough to take up with them.  The blacks were very aggressive with women on, and off the base.  Many had a hard time functioning in a military environment even though, again, they were under the identical conditions as the whites.</p>
<p>Germany would be far better off with the American troops being entirely withdrawn now that the Cold War is over.  Unfortunately, our globalist government appears intent on sending our troops into more nations thus spreading the pox of black serviceman upon more unsuspecting cultures.</p>

		<p>Post # 8, when I was in the army in Germany in the 1970s, you could spot the low life Germans who went with Black GIs.  They dyed their hair very blond and wore low waisted American jeans instead of the high waisted pants the German girls wore.  And they spoke a foul mouthed German accented ghetto English.  It must have disgusted the German men, but everyone knew they were trash.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Turk in Germany. There are not too many black-white couples here, in comparison to France or the UK, apart from big cities and border regions (especially French border where Blacks claim benefits in both countries). Even the Turks can&rsquo;t get along with Blacks. Very few Africans studying at the universities can get diplomas, but the bulk remain here and live on welfare.</p>
<p>The media promotes everywhere miscegenation, best example is, as most of you know Heidi Klum. It&rsquo;s cool to be black nowadays, parents name their children &#8220;Jason, Kevin, Scarlett&#8221;&hellip; Newspapers are liberal controlled, too.</p>
<p>Concerning the Turks, they mostly live in their neighborhoods and rarely intermarry (except fake ones for the passport).<br>

<i>It must have driven the German guys insane.</i></p>
<p>No, not really. Like most of the other (Northern) Europeans, they&rsquo;ve transformed from Germanic warriors who terrorized the continent in the past, into politically correct, weak eunuchs.<br>
Grandfathers must be very sad&hellip;</p>

		<p>This story deeply disturbs me. It is just one more reason why Germany should tell America to GET OUT of its territory and close down its bases on German soil. What does Germany need American troops in its country for anyways? I mean its not like an army of Danes are going to sweep down from the north and wreak havoc on Hamburg or something. Germany has a population of 82 million and the largest economy in Europe. It doesn&rsquo;t need to accept American hegemony. Switzerland, Sweden and Ireland have never had American troops on their territory. In my opinion they are much better off for it too.</p>

		<p>I agree with Istvan. To deport somebody on such grounds while concurrently allowing millions of illegal aliens from Mexico to reside - even promising amnesty - is a sickening disgrace.</p>
<p>This nation has stooped to very low levels since the end of WWII. He may have been black, but since this isn&rsquo;t a White Nationalist country (unfortunately) we should have made him a citizen and taken responsibility. It is an egregious double standard when you consider the mass influx of illegals from across the southern border.</p>

		<p>Eh&hellip; black and German&hellip;? Pardon me, and call me a &#8220;traditionalist,&#8221; if you must, but I am German (with an American passport), and that is utterly nonsensical to me. He may be a black man with a German passport, but that by no means makes him a &#8220;German.&#8221; The result of such unions is and always has been miscegenation. And, no, I will not hold hands in a circle and sing kumbaya.</p>
<p>Yes Hitler did make a mistake; he lost the damn war! Are we really better off for it? Count the millions who have been killed in Rwanda and other such lovely places since then before you answer. Or the millions killed by Stalin, America&rsquo;s WWII ally, or Mao and the Chinese, where we now shop. We have become so used to our hypocricy that we hardly notice it anymore.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black German Cultural Society&#8221; this seems a contradiction. One can either be black or German but not both. It appears that the offspring of these Black American and German Women unions are more accepted in America than Germany. Maybe, Germany needed a Judge like that one from Louisiana to forbid them?</p>

		<p>While Europeans might claim not to be bothered by mixed-race couples, I find that a bit hard to believe. My European relatives privately told me most Austrians are secretly disgusted and have to make an effort to hide their utter contempt for mixed-race couples and their mixed-race offspring.</p>

		<p>I know some Germans back in the late 80s. They told me black American soldiers were looked at as Americans for the most part. It was disgusting to see our buffoons loafing around beautiful German town squares with ghetto blasters blaring 2 Live Crew. Thank god most of them are gone.</p>
<p>I always wondered if the black soldiers dependents ever bothered learning anything about Germany. Here they were in a region with more than a 1000 years of fascinating history and I bet they spent all their time telling their German neighbors about MLK and American civil rights. </p>

		<p>This story reminds me of a news story I heard some years back that black American sailors were not allowed to leave their ship while docked in Russia.  I have never been able to find that story but I believe that George Bush 41 was President at the time.</p>
<p>I remember at the time, I told my husband that was probably a smart move on the Russians part.  Unlike Italy and Germany after WWII, because they didn&rsquo;t want the black soldiers getting mixed up with their Russian women.  I know there was some real brouhaha over it but after that one news story, I never heard anymore about it.</p>

		<p>RE Whiteplight #6..<br>
Hitler was a lunatic and worse, was used by the Stalin government to further its own ends, which would have been a total success but for the surprise act of Barbarossa and the Western front being won by the Allies. Stalin armed and used Hitler thoroughly. For the fascinating truth about WW2 I suggest reading Viktor Suvorov&rsquo;s &#8220;Icebreaker&#8221;.<br>
Icebreaker was the code name for Hitler; he would break through the ice of the Western allies and prepare the way for a later entry and conquest by Soviet forces.<br>
So much for Hitler the patriot, and the racial hero. He was a Communist front who turned on his &#8220;patrons&#8221;.<br>
BTW Whiteplight&hellip;I enjoy your posts. </p>

		<p>back in 1970s those blacks GIs got into the military by being drafted, not by passing an IQ test. So their quality must have been much lower than the quality of those who are there now (not that these ones are stellar, but they are above the black average). One way or the other, why so much concern about German girls of the dumber sort? Maybe it&rsquo;s just a sort of eugenics, eliminating their genes out of the white stock and into the black.</p>

		<p>This is the amount of incredulous influence the  &mdash;  OPEN BORDER  &mdash;  lobbyists (business power brokers and ethnic zealots)) have on certain Democratic devious rabble? Once again the senate top echelon have huddled secretly (BEHIND CLOSED DOORS), recklessly placing E-Verify worker identification system in jeopardy. The obnoxious</p>
<p>R-O-P-E Senate group as its being called on the Internet and nationwide, who are marked  as Reid, Obama, Pelosi  Emmanuel have indifferently pushed American Workers in the background, allowing the millions of illegal aliens to take their jobs. They have driven into the ground amendments from appearing in the final Homeland Security &#8220;conference committee&#8221; bill.  They eradicated  &mdash;  ANY CHANCE  &mdash;  of a Senate&rsquo;s permanent authorization of the E-Verify program.</p>
<p>They have religiously under-funded, undermined the Senate&rsquo;s mandate to beef up and complete the final 300 mile Mexican border fence. Then again it was never the original border wall as designed by Rep. Duncan Hunter. Illegal Aliens would have first had to scale the  &mdash;  FIRST  &mdash;  fence, run across the two lane highway for the Border Patrol vehicles, then scale an identical  &mdash;  SECOND FENCE. Under funded and weakened just like E-Verify, the police 287(g) arrest and detainment and ceasing the massive ICE raids. Finally the ROPE group strangled the Senate (already) passed ability of countrywide businesses to run their previous hires employees through E-Verify. So you can guess this is a harbinger to drop on the AMERICAN WORKER YET ANOTHER ULTIMATELY EXPENSIVE BLANKET AMNESTY. THOSE TAXPAYERS WILL BE FORCED TO PICK UP A TRILLION DOLLAR TAB. Be advised that Reid D-NV, Pelosi D-CA have one of the largest population of illegal immigrants in the country, who they are subservient too. Remember to expend your frustration and anger at 202-224-3121on your lawmakers. They are juggling with millions of American Workers job lifeline, by pandering to people who shouldn&rsquo;t even be here?</p>
<p><br>
 MY SUGGESTION IS DON&#8221;T BUY ANY SERVICES FROM BUSINESS THAT DOESN&rsquo;T DISPLAY THE E-VERIFY PLACARD. Remember the real conniving happens in rooms hidden from the public awareness in conference committees. In addition, Remember Harry Reid as an incumbent Senator who carries the blemish of being anti-American Worker, Anti-Sovereignty must not be re-elected. Speaker Pelosi must go? So must Emmanuel? They have proved they cannot be trusted As NUMBERSUSA president says,&#8221; With no chance now of E-Verify dying in any minute, because they couldn&rsquo;t annul the 3 year extension?  The pro-amnesty forces no longer can try to use it as a bargaining chip.  States, counties, cities and businesses can now be quite confident that they can set policy based on the E-Verify program being around.&#8221; IT&rsquo;S NOT PERMANENT YET THANKS TO ROPE. This group has given preference to illegal workers instead of the 15 million authorized AMERICAN WORKERS. COMPREHEND MORE OF THE CORRUPTION THAT CANNOT BE DENIED BY POLITICIANS AT JUDICIAL WATCH. NUMBERSUSA will explain in detail the consequences, that includes the 2010 Census, Health Care, hidden welfare programs, Anchor babies, criminals amongst the illegal immigration occupiers.

<p>&#8220;It is my contention that the majority of white females are hard wired to betray their own racial stock without the heavy hand of patriarchial control. Perhaps all women are hard-wired like this, but white women in particular seem to be the most aggressive in their actions&hellip;they seem to thrive and revel in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I don&rsquo;t think that this explanation is getting to the truth of the issue.  I went to the link on the chart about mixed marriages on the Amren article from a few days ago and I noticed that white women actually mix less than any other race. That is, when questioned on if they would.  Most non-white women in the world wish for white men.  Also, I think that it is the social pressures that have made white women act like this, for the most part.  Then, there is the perception of the alpha male.  The media, world wide, has made blacks into super-men.  White women in particular come from a culture that in its roots is all about the image of a strong, masterful man.  The popular media has made African American culture a world wide victor, finished off with the cojoling of young Americans into electing the first black president.  Women do seem to have this weakness, and it often expresses itself in a desire to seem socially elite.  On top of all the white guilt that has been so commerically laid on whites, we have the likes of Heidi Klum, and the sort of slutty popularity of the likes of Madonna, that have driven young white women to this degradation.  </p>

		<p>A friend of mine worked in Belgium at SHAPE headquarters. He basically said the same as some posters here, that white females would throw themselves at black enlisted men who could barely string a sentence together.  </p>
<p>My own conclusion is that when race is a socially taboo subject, and white males are unable to fulfil their primal role of driving off competing genetics, it triggers an unnatural response in some people to find other primal outcomes.<br>

		<p>I would say the majority of white women are not hard wired to betray their own race. I would say a small percentage are hard wired for dysfunction and those are the ones who pursue black women. It is primarily a media obession and all of their attention goes to this small subset so as to encourage more white women to do it. </p>
<p>White U.S. soldiers have no problem getting German girls either so it is not a widespread preference for blacks over whites. Whenever I run across a German military bride in the U.S. she is always married to a white soldier. The German women who take up with blacks most likely bought into the media fabrication of the glorious black male and soon learn their lesson the hard way. After all, a pairing of a high IQ white German woman and an individual from the dumbest population group on the face of the earth will not be long for this world.</p>
<p>This kind of gels with an obeservation I have had here in the Twin Cities. You always notice a high number of interracial couples in areas when blacks first arrive in small numbers. A couple years down the road, after the black population has grown a little bit and made its reputation known, you begin to see almost NO interracial couples. People learn quickly. It&rsquo;s only important that a woman does not make the forever mistake of bearing a child for one.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This story deeply disturbs me. It is just one more reason why Germany should tell America to GET OUT of its territory and close down its bases on German soil. What does Germany need American troops in its country for anyways?&#8221;</p>
<p>Germany shouldn&rsquo;t have to tell American troops to leave. We should have left years ago and this goes for any other places we have military bases. The USA spends billions on defense in Europe, indirectly subsidizing their welfare states and also spends billion helping to defend nations around the world by having these bases. The American taxpayer shouldn&rsquo;t be defending foreign soil, let Europe etc. fully defend itself. We need to close all of these bases, bring our troops home and put them on our southern border. The money saved, which would be billions, should go to the aid of the American people or paying off our debt to China.</p>

		<p>I heard a story about a work buddy of a friend&rsquo;s father. This fellow was a US soldier in Germany after the war and had met a German woman. They agreed to meet in town later. At their next encounter she brought along her mulatto bastard son (of which he had no previous knowledge of or her lack of morals). He expressed his disgust to her. She said &#8220;Oh, but all you Americans are the same.&#8221; To which he replied, &#8220;The hell they are!!!&#8221;, and then walked off in disgust.</p>

<p>I agree that there  is a fishy smell to this whole story.  For instance, before he was adopted by a military family &#8220;as a toddler&#8221;, &#8220;he suffered sexual and physical abuse&#8221; in a German children&rsquo;s home.   Now you mean to tell me that this 47-year-old can remember what happened to him before he was a toddler?  Come on!   And we&rsquo;re supposed to feel sorry for him because the poor thing is a victim.   He has a admitted  history of being a junkie and a thief and being always in trouble with the law his whole life, so I would not be too inclined to believe anything he has to say.</p>
