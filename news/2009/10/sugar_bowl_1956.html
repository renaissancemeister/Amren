			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gilbert Caldwell, American Renaissance, December 2001</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Throughout most of American history the South was the repository of wisdom and courage when it came to racial and cultural survival. Despite having suffered the desolation of the war and the oppression of Reconstruction, the citizens of Dixie emerged at the end of the nineteenth century with their peoplehood intact, protected by social custom and law. This situation continued with little disturbance until after the Second World War. It was then that a coalition of forces led by the United States government, launched a massive assault upon white southern institutions.</p>
<p>Popular accounts of the turbulent two decades that finally brought the former Confederate states to their knees focus on the intensity of Southern resistance. In reality, we now know that Southern politicians were often negotiating surrender even as they stood in schoolhouse doorways. Equally distressing is that the masses of Southerners, although concerned with racial survival, were often far too concerned with other things. Among those other concerns was the desire to play big-time college football.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief account of one conflict between the demands of racial survival and the pursuit of sports. It tells us much about changes that had taken place in the hearts and minds of those whose ancestors sang, &#8220;and rather than submit to shame, to die we would prefer.&#8221;</p>
<p>On November 26, 1955, at Atlanta&rsquo;s Grant Field, the all-white Georgia Tech football team defeated the all-white University of Georgia team by a score of 21  &mdash;  3. This victory made Tech 8-1-1 for the year, and earned it an invitation to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, where it would face the University of Pittsburgh. The Pitt Panthers had finished with a record of 7-3, but had captured the Eastern College Lambert Trophy, and were seen as capable of giving the powerful Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets a good game.</p>
<p>Three days after the victory, the legendary Tech coach Bobby Dodd received a telegram from Hugh C. Grant, a career diplomat and founder of Georgia&rsquo;s States Rights Council. It read, &#8220;Urge your cooperation in preventing a breakdown of our laws, customs and traditions of racial segregation.&#8221; What prompted Grant&rsquo;s telegram was the presence of a black fullback, Bobby Grier, on the Pitt roster. Tech had a tradition of all-white athletics, and Grant wanted to be sure that tradition would be upheld.</p>
<p><b>The Southern Tradition</b></p>
<p>Throughout the twentieth century Southern schools had refused to compete against integrated teams. This normally resulted in a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement, sometimes written into game contracts, stipulating that when an integrated team played a Southern school the black players would stay out of the lineup.</p>
<p>If Northern teams did not bench their black players, Southern schools refused to play, whatever the consequences. In 1907, the University of Alabama baseball team refused to take the field against the University of Vermont in Burlington, when the latter insisted on keeping two black players in the lineup. The Alabamans chose to be fined and forfeit the game. In 1923, the Washington and Lee football team from Virginia refused to play Washington and Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, because the latter team would not bench its black quarterback. The Virginian squad just packed its bags and went home.</p>
<p>On November 2, 1929, a visit by University of Georgia to New York&rsquo;s Yankee Stadium for a football game against New York University touched off an enormous controversy. The Northern press and even some congressmen demanded that NYU not honor the gentleman&rsquo;s agreement to bench its two black players  &mdash;  to no avail. In Georgia, even the liberal <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite> hailed NYU&rsquo;s decision to remove the blacks from its roster.</p>
<p>Even border states shared the sentiment against integrated sports during the pre&#150;World War II period. In 1930, the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, demanded that Ohio State keep an all-Big Ten black tackle out of the game. The Buckeyes honored the request.</p>
<p>As the years went by, the talents of black football players made the standard Southern request sound like a desire for unfair advantage. Thus, for a 1934 game between Georgia Tech and University of Michigan, the Wolverines agreed to keep their star black end, Willis Ward, out of the game only if Tech benched its star end, Hoot Gibson.</p>
<p>As in so many racial matters, the Second World War was a turning point in the formerly consistent Southern position. The late &rsquo;40s saw the integration of major league baseball by Jackie Robinson, and the fledgling National Basketball Association signed three blacks in 1950. Pro football, which had an unspoken color line from 1934 till 1946, was rapidly hiring blacks.</p>
<p>The first defections from the Southern position occurred when schools (with the notable exception of those in Mississippi and Alabama) began to play integrated teams, provided the games were not held in the South. Georgia adopted this new policy in 1950 at a game in San Francisco against St. Mary&rsquo;s College, and Tech followed in 1953 at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The Sugar Bowl itself followed this Northern standard. In 1955, in order to lure a Northern opponent to the big game in New Orleans, the bowl committee followed the pattern of the Orange and Cotton Bowls, and made two crucial changes. Integrated teams could come, and segregation would not be enforced in the visiting team&rsquo;s section of the stadium. These changes cleared the way for the invitation of Pitt to the 1956 game.</p>
<p>Until then, no Deep-South team had ever played an integrated team in the South, and this was what prompted Grant&rsquo;s telegram to Coach Dodd.</p>
<p><b>Controversy at Tech</b></p>
<p>The coach brought the matter up with university president Blake R. Van Leer, who notified the governor&rsquo;s office. It is reported that even before the telegram from Grant, Coach Dodd had polled his team and found that every member wanted to play the game, even with Grier on the field. He contacted Governor Marvin Griffin, who replied, &#8220;Bobby, I can&rsquo;t come out publicly and support this [game]. But you go ahead and do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning of December 2nd, Governor Griffin called the Tech Athletic Association and asked for 24 tickets to the Sugar Bowl game. Amazingly, a little later that same day the governor held a press conference in which he fiercely denounced participation in the game. These hypocritical antics were to be common in the ensuing years as the likes of Governors Faubus, Wallace and Barnett raged passionately against integration in public while they helped promote it in private.</p>
<p>That day for the public, at least, Griffin said: &#8220;It is my request that athletic teams of the University System of Georgia not be permitted to engage in contests with other teams where the races are mixed or where segregation is not required among spectators. The South stands at Armageddon. The battle is joined. We cannot make the slightest concession to the enemy in this dark and lamented hour of struggle. There is no difference between compromising the integrity of race on the playing field and doing so in the classrooms. One break in the dike, and the relentless seas will rush in and destroy us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was not the 1930s, and the response of Tech&rsquo;s student body as well as its football team was much different from that of the school that simply refused to play an integrated Michigan team. That same night, December 2nd, a huge crowd of Tech students marched on the Capitol Building and the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion to protest the governor&rsquo;s segregationist views. On the way they smashed stores, tore up parking meters, and overturned trash cans. They broke into the Capitol Building, smashing locks, windows and furniture. They chanted and waved signs saying &#8220;To Hell With Griffin,&#8221; &#8220;Impeach Griffin,&#8221; &#8220;Grow Up, Griffin,&#8221; and &#8220;Griffin Sits On His Brains.&#8221; The Governor stayed in his mansion with the lights out, and only when former Tech football star Milton &#8220;Mugsy&#8221; Smith assured the crowd that the team would go to New Orleans did the students disperse, around three in the morning.</p>
<p>The riot prompted one Georgia state legislator to remark in the following days that &#8220;no one should in the future be admitted to Tech if he adhered to the principles of integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sentiment around the state was mixed. The University of Georgia held a &#8220;For Once We&rsquo;re With Tech&#8221; rally to encourage Tech to go to New Orleans. The <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite> now saw the Governor as &#8220;embarrassing the University and the state.&#8221; In another significant reversal, the acting Chancellor of Pittsburgh announced there would be &#8220;no compromises,&#8221; and Grier would &#8220;eat, sleep and play with his team.&#8221; Contrary to what it had done for half a century, the North was not backing down. It was up to the South to act.</p>
<p>The final decision rested with the 15-member Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, which met on Monday, December 5th. Despite the opposition of some well-known segregationists on the Board (among them Roy Harris, later President of the Citizens Councils of America) the board decided overwhelmingly to play the game. Indeed, the school&rsquo;s president Van Lear threatened to quit if the board reached any other decision. Nonetheless, the board affirmed that segregation would be enforced at all Tech home games.</p>
<p>Now that he had taken a publicly segregationist stand, Griffin had no choice but to cancel his order for the 24 seats. He said he and his staff &#8220;would give no comfort to Negroes and white folks playing on the same field,&#8221; and &#8220;did not want to see colored folks sitting next to white people in the stands.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The Game</b></p>
<p>On January 2, 1956, the 22nd annual Sugar Bowl was held in New Orleans before more than 80,000 fans. Bobby Grier started the game for Pitt, and even made the tackle on the opening kick off. Later, on a crucial play, Grier was called for pass interference at the Pitt one-yard line, and Tech scored on the next play. The score did not change after that, resulting in a 7  &mdash;  0 Georgia Tech victory. After the game, Grier claimed the call against him had been unfair, but he did admit that the Tech players had been gentlemanly throughout the contest. According to the <cite>New York Times,</cite> the crowd &#8220;repeatedly cheered the Negro fullback for a gallant performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the Georgia state legislature convened the following year, Senator Leon Butts introduced a bill that would legally ban &#8220;all athletic matches, physical games, social functions and entertainment events&#8221; in which blacks and whites participated together. Butts declared that &#8220;when whites and Negroes meet on the athletic fields on a basis of complete equality it is only natural that this sense of equality carry over into the daily living of the people.&#8221; The bill passed the Georgia Senate but was defeated in the House. The <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite> editorialized against the bill because it would make it impossible to schedule north/south games, and would adversely affect the &#8220;national status of the Southeastern Conference.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Total Surrender</b></p>
<p>In retrospect the bill&rsquo;s passage or defeat seems irrelevant. In 1959 the United States Supreme Court declared a similar ban in Louisiana unconstitutional, and the Brown decision on school integration was slowly being carried out throughout the South. For a brief period in the late 1950s, Alabama and Mississippi teams refused invitations to national tournaments and bowl games against mixed-race teams, but eventually they, too, capitulated.</p>
<p>As Southern schools became integrated, it was inevitable that their athletic teams would follow suit. First to fall were the Southwestern and Atlantic Conference schools. Eventually the Southeastern Conference (SEC) border states joined them in fielding mixed-race teams. In 1971 Ole Miss itself had a black basketball player and in 1972 a black football player. By 1975, close to half the athletes in all sports in the SEC were black, and in 1980 the number reached 70 percent. Today the figure is no doubt even higher.</p>
<p>What difference does it make whether sports teams are integrated or whether white players take the field against blacks? During the Sugar Bowl controversy of late 1955, the <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite> criticized Roy Harris and Hugh Grant for thinking that &#8220;a football game (is) a social event. No tea will be served. As further assurance for the extremist group, there are no females on either team and there is absolutely no danger of intermarriage as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is significant that the paper implicitly endorsed social segregation and condemned miscegenation, but it failed to think things through. The <cite>Constitution</cite> and the pro-game contingent failed to grasp that any form of easy social mingling inevitably yields friendships and eventually, inter-racial dating and marriage. As the reality of fewer than 50 years later demonstrates, the prophecies of the integrationists were wrong, and those of the segregationists were right.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the entry of large numbers of blacks into sports changes their very character. Black behavior is the precise opposite of the standards of graciousness, humility, and sportsmanship whites developed over a period of centuries. In black-dominated sports it is now a matter of course to insult and humiliate one&rsquo;s opponents, to swagger in victory and sulk in defeat. At the same time, the emergence of black &#8220;super-stars&#8221; has accelerated the general acceptance of non-whites in all areas of society.</p>
<p>The American South is, of course, not alone in suffering the consequences of letting athletics become the first concession against racial integrity. It was under the National Party that sports-mad South Africa opened the first breach in apartheid by letting a racially-mixed New Zealand rugby team tour the country in the late 1960s. Three decades later, it was the same National Party that surrendered the entire country to black rule and the savagery that has followed. White Rhodesians wanted to play international cricket  &mdash;  and got the nightmare of rule by Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p>As for the students of Georgia Tech, all they wanted was to play in the Sugar Bowl. They have lived to see their grandchildren come of age in a multi-racial South, in which whites have no more racial pride than New Yorkers or Californians.</p>
<p>If it was not entirely clear in 1957, it is certainly clear today. Whites everywhere are under siege; and for a people under siege there can be no compromise.</p>

<p>This is the only part of the article that I didn&rsquo;t like when I first read it in the printed version of AR, and I still don&rsquo;t like it.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for someone writing from the comfort of a computer in December 2001, and not in the Deep South in the 1950s and 60s, to (no pun intended) Monday morning quarterback the &#8220;antics&#8221; of George Wallace.  I am not aware of either Wallace, Faubus or Barnett promoting integration even in private.  I mean, what would the author have expected them to do?   I guess he wanted George Wallace to stay in front of the University of Alabama.  At that point, he would have been arrested for contempt of court, or something like that.  George Wallace might not have been a pure savior, but he certainly couldn&rsquo;t have done our people any good from Federal prison!</p>
<p>Considering time, place and circumstance, Wallace, Faubus, Barnett and Maddox did the best they could possibly do.</p>
<p>As much as I would have been for segregation in the American South, the caste system in India and Apartheid in South Africa, it is my observation that these kinds of systems tend to fall apart.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but that&rsquo;s just the trend.</p>

<p><br>
Despite the paper&rsquo;s sarcasm about how adding black males to a white male football team poses no danger of intermarriage, the writer should recognize that the young black males of that time probably had no better way to gain access white females than by becoming a sports star. HIs teammates sisters, cheerleaders, <i>all kinds</i> of white women would now at least be within the black player&rsquo;s social circle   &mdash;   even in a time and place otherwise mostly segregated. So it&rsquo;s fair to say that the chances of miscegenation <i>would</i> greatly increase. </p>
<p>Which is, of course, why a lot of these black players wanted on the team in the first place. </p>

<p>How things change in just a few decades. Even to ponder if segregation might be a good thing or not isn&rsquo;t permitted today. At least not if you are white. Whites folks have a very short-sighted way of dealing with the world. </p>

		<p>So, blacks, who are 13% of the population, and who are always concerned everyplace in America must look more like the demographic chart, now make up 70 percent of the students in college athletics? We need a video of one of these pro-black activists going on about how it wont change the racial balance. They&rsquo;d eat their hat first!</p>

		<p>Even if Tech and the politicians had stood firm in 1956, the inevitable expansion of professional sports into Dixie would have had the same result. Given the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_League#AFL_franchises" rel="nofollow">the AFL had teams in Houston and Dallas</a> when it formed in 1960 (then added Miami in 1966) the delay would have been 4-5 years at most.</p>
<p>That said, I have long contended that my fellow Southerners are far too consumed with sports, especially at the college level. Some, I&rsquo;m convinced, would gladly sell their souls to Satan in return for a national championship. How much time, money and emotional energy are wasted on souvenirs, season tickets, road trips, booster club meetings, etc.? We need to abandon the corrupt circus of sports and put our loyalty where it belongs   &mdash;   with family, God and Dixie.</p>
<p>Several years ago the local paper ran a story about a University of Florida alumnus whose entire house was an orange-and-blue shrine to &#8220;Gator Nation,&#8221; full of every kind of memorabilia imaginable. About the only thing missing was a life-sized bronze statue of Steve Spurrier. Normally my reaction to such buffoonery would be &#8220;Get a life&#8221;; since the story was the man&rsquo;s obituary, it was too late for that advice.</p>

This is a long way from where we are today. What does the author think should have been done that day that would have changed anything today? Wall off the South?</p>
<p>It is ludicrous to think that in a country with 40 million blacks that they aren&rsquo;t going to play ball against whites, that day or the next day. </p>
<p>The rest was probably inevitable as well: the rise of the liberal beta-male, the imposition of P.C., the surrender of whites, all of it&hellip;</p>

<p>Emory Burke, a true White Nationalist who went to prison for his views, told me that going to prison is EXACTLY what Southern governors should have done to stop integration. Look what prison did for the career of Nelson Mandela. George Wallace was thoroughly brow-beaten when he got a lecture from LBJ on &#8220;his place in history.&#8221; Ross Barnett lost his nerve when white Mississippians were ready to march on Ole Miss and drive out the Federal Marshals and National Guard. John Kennedy would then have been the one to back down just as he did at the Bay of Pigs.<br>

<p>Actually, this is not true. In college football, whites still make up the majority of athletes. In all other sports besides basketball - baseball, track (other than the sprints), hockey, tennis, golf, wrestling, volleyball, swimming ..etc, blacks are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>White athletes win the majority of medals in both the summer and winter Olympics.</p>

		<p>This has also carried over into professional sports in the North. The absolute mad obsession of rooting for team&rsquo;s comprised of multi millionaire&rsquo;s who wouldn&rsquo;t give you the time of day if you met them in the street is beyond me. It is one thing to appreciate the skill of the player&rsquo;s and have an affection for your hometown or alma mater, but this mindless vicarious attachement to these team&rsquo;s and individual&rsquo;s is impossible to understand. In all of these team sport&rsquo;s, pro and college who makes up 95% plus of the live gate and overall fan support? It would be great if a shrink could explain the reasoning behind these attachemnet&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>One notable characteristic of all sports is their relative freedom from favortism and cronyism.  Sports are probably the closest institution we have to a true meritocracy. Athletes compete on a purely objective basis.  You can either hit for power with a .300 average or you can&rsquo;t  You can either throw a live 98 mph fastball with good control or you can&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Black athletes who can compete in college or professional sports should have every opportunity to do so. Their presence has brought all sports to a higher level of competitiveness and play.</p>
<p>What blacks (or anybody else) are not entitled to are set asides or waivers to allow them to gain positions in other endeavors for which they clearly are not qualified.</p>

		<p>I no longer watch football. I quit watching solely due to the black players. I can&rsquo;t stand watching the chest pounding grand standing that goes on. There used to be humility and mutual respect. I hear my co-workers, (whites) talking about sports and can&rsquo;t help but think how they are contributing to the demise of our race and civilized society.</p>

<p>As a paper bag over the head of the team that Rush Limbaugh is about to buy, and a frequent Rush listener, (I do need to hear the liberal side of things, after all), I&rsquo;m taking great interest in this deal and of the reaction.  </p>
<p>I think the rhetoric on the start of certain black players is nothing more than that.</p>

Beauregarde:</p>
<p>You just proved my point.  I know who George Wallace, Ross Barnett and Lester Maddox are, but I didn&rsquo;t know off the top of my head who Emory Burke is.  A few seconds on Google and I found out that he was an adherent of ideology similar to Germany in the 1930s, which would have gone over like a lead balloon when trying to get the votes from all those white Southern men who fought in World War II, (even in spite of the great philosophical irony of it all.)</p>
<p>Son, what world are you living in?  It&rsquo;s certainly not this one, when we as right-wing racially minded whites have to be purer than the wind driven snow and the wife of Caesar combined.  The prison act worked for Nelson Mandela because he was black and left-wing.  It would not have worked for George Wallace because he was white, and racially right-wing, and populist.  If he would have gone to jail for a COC, or anything else, it would have ruined his Presidential ambitions outside the Deep South.  In 1968 or today, there are more states in the union than MS and AL.</p>
<p>While George Wallace losing an argument to LBJ or anyone was way out of character for Wallace, it happened because LBJ was a total phony, and such a cynical and Machiavellian and Hegelian log-roller, back scratcher and palm greaser, that he would have successfully argued to a nudist that a nudist should have a top hat.  LBJ was a seggy when he had to be, and an integrationist when he had to be.  Wallace might have lost that argument, but at least he wasn&rsquo;t arguing from a phony and whorish standpoint like LBJ was.</p>
<p>JFK would not have backed down.  Haven&rsquo;t you heard of anarcho-tyranny?  He backed down at the Bay of Pigs because the Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear weapons.  Southern Governors only had a National Guard that could be Federalized at Presidential whim.  And the communists, like JFK, were left-wing and believed in racial equality.  Birds of a feather&hellip;</p>

		<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the battle for prestige in athletics was lost long ago. If one takes a close look at the NBA today, he/she will see very few successful white American players. Granted, there are successful foreign white players such as Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, Manu Ginobili (while some see him as Latino, most people from Argentina are of purely European origin), and Pau Gasol. However, the two most popular American sports are so thoroughly dominated by blacks that many potential white athletes realize that it is foolish to attempt to compete in a black dominated arena. Oh well, I suppose that we still have Hockey, for all that&rsquo;s worth.</p>

		<p>Only today the NFL black players announced they will refuse to play if Rush Limbaugh buys or even tries to buy a NFL team.<br>
All the MORE reason Rush should buy. I&rsquo;d bet they&rsquo;d have no problem with the idea of the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright buying an NFL team. But do you remember liberals saying they were going to move out of the country if Bush were elected, unfortunately they didn&rsquo;t. Same things going to happen here. I also have never understood this over the top obsession with sports that seems to infect most White men. Even racially aware White men just live for the next game where they can cheer on the openly anti-White racist black &#8220;playas&#8221;. Even the most racist black thug gets a pass with these &#8220;White boys&#8221; because &#8220;they might get &#8220;us&#8221; to the Super Bowl&#8221;. They think it&rsquo;s great that their White kids have posters of black thugs in their rooms to admire as their &#8220;heros&#8221;. I will go to my grave never understanding this insane mindset. </p>

		<p>AWP:  In baseball, it&rsquo;s worse.  If you&rsquo;re white, you may have very few blacks with which to compete, but there are many many cheap exploitable Caribbeans that are now allowed to flood the market thanks to something ironically called the COMPETE Act.  You&rsquo;re not cracking the MLB if you&rsquo;re white unless you&rsquo;re a rare talent.</p>

		<p>Integration in sports were inevitable&hellip;people want to see the best performers regardless of genetics. Sadly the excessive enthusiasm for organized sports shows that like in the days of bread and circus the majority of people are not very deep,&hellip;white or not. Mindless cheering for ones adopted group/team satisfy&rsquo;s some simple primal need that doesn&rsquo;t evolve in the herd. This is one of the things Ayn Rand despised and valiantly pointed out in her major works. There is safety and comfort in the herd as well as an escape from the arduous task of becoming an individual. This is just human nature for the majority. As far as the ensueing miscegination.?..let it follow its own course &hellip; as I see it. Its not logical to disallow poeple to join with who they like,.. my opinion and solution is philosophical in that open forum of opinions as on Amren will at least expose to the more astute whites a cleaner more factual perception of historical unfoldings of the different races, dispelling antiwhite propogandas mascarading as verity&rsquo;s, ..making the playing field of reality more level. Incidentally&hellip; our team.. (whites) have in my view deserved its castigations for wrongs done no less than I have as an individual and I welcome honest critique of both But still don&rsquo;t plan on jumping ship in either.</p>

		<p>The sight  most hideous is the racial makeup of the spectators of these games.  There are by far so many more white fans than any others.  Vastly more.  And they are projecting their self worth on a college football team (or and NFL team) that is made up of primarily obnoxious and or savage black athletes.  These athletes love to prey on white girls, cheerleaders and such, and more than once t.v. viewers and stadium fans have seen some white girl being &#8220;proposed&#8221; to by some popular black athlete.  And cheering.  Conclusion: if you are white and are still married to these sports teams and their disgusting displays of aberrant human behavior,  you are playing the part of a &#8220;useful idiot&#8221;, adding to the coffers of the organizations that are working to your destruction.  You are an insult to the values of white civilization.. p.s.  this includes Rush Limbaugh</p>

<p>Only if you include Divisions II and III. The NFL&rsquo;s anti-white bigotry has filtered down to the bigger colleges (see Web link above), no doubt due to the presence of several former NFL coaches. Outside of the service academies, there are few Division I teams with majority-white starting lineups.</p>

		<p>What isn&rsquo;t mentioned here is the reason for peoples&rsquo; fanatical devotion to their sports teams. It&rsquo;s hereditary, genetic.</p>
<p>This is only a theory but it has been suggested that sports teams are a modern replacement for early mans&rsquo; hunter gatherer bands. A tribe would send off a group of hunters upon whom the very survival of the group depended. They learned to support them in whatever way they could. From this developed various methods to help insure the bands success. Special markings, send off parties, etc. This behavior gradually became encoded in early mans&rsquo; brain.</p>
<p>Most of us have been caught up in this at one time or another, but it&rsquo;s wise to remember that this is really a new version of an old theme, and to remember where it comes from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that an ancient system to help preserve the tribe is now being used quite succesfully to help destroy it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Constitution and the pro-game contingent failed to grasp that any form of easy social mingling inevitably yields friendships and eventually, inter-racial dating and marriage. As the reality of fewer than 50 years later demonstrates, the prophecies of the integrationists were wrong, and those of the segregationists were right.&#8221;</p>

		<p>  We should be allowed to have our own leagues . That would be freedom . Even if it had to be run on a shoestring and played in tiny stadiums/gymnasiums, I would have to predict it would eventually collapse the NFL,AFL and pro basketball . Of course all of that would be illegal in today&rsquo;s insane world . But every time you see a non-white sports star, news anchor, weather person etc. remember, there are a legion of whites out there who were qualified and wanted that position and didn&rsquo;t get it because they are white . And this logic applies right on down to the person sacking your groceries . The Feds today are literally paying corporations to hire so-called minorities .</p>

<p>I agree with your anthropological interpretation of modern man&rsquo;s  seemingly irrational dedication to sports teams.  It&rsquo;s deeply genetic, based in ancient human experience. </p>
<p>However, I would suspect that those were more likely to be war parties that were being sent out, with all the fanfare and ceremony that accompanied their send-off.  Yes, bands of hunters too, I suppose.  But  most especially warriors. Successful warriors would bring back  women, booty, and slaves   &mdash;   not just meat.    </p>
<p>We have just taken those tribal wars, cleaned them up and civilized them a bit, removed the bloodshed, toned down the violence, and put them inside a football stadium where people can cheer their heroes (or hate their enemies). And then they go home, all that steam let off, with no one having been murdered.  Not much else has changed. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not fall for the fashionable leftist point of view that people were all living peacefully with one another prior to modern times.  Human  history is full of terrible violence.  And not all conflict is about food.  Violent sports are just a safety valve for our innate violence.</p>

		<p>Throughout most of American history the south was the repository of wisdom when it came to racial and cultural survival.</p>
<p> NOT TRUE AT ALL. The south was responsible for slavery and the importation of blacks to sustain it. This was a form of involuntary immigration which ill-served the nations&rsquo; best interests. Had there been no slavery there would have been no blacks. The south created a large black presence in the country. The south burdened the country with blacks. The south worked against America&rsquo;s best interests. There would have been no need to worry about racial and cultural survival had there been no large black community in the country. The south created this community through the greed and short-sightedness of slavery. Had I been living in America in 1608-1861 I would have been the strongest abolitionist. Not because I thought slavery was wrong (although it was) but because it brought blacks to America.   </p>

		<p>   7:16PM, You are right that the whole thing has led to disaster for our nation . But it would have been hard to predict and the African was blessed for having been brought here . The South never asked for the slaves, the European powers started bringing them in to the South first . Most notably the the Dutch around 1611 in Virginia . But no two groups were more responsible for having brought the African to America than were the British and New Englanders . But even so, something like less than 6 or 7 % of the Atlantic slave trade came to what is now the U.S. And those that were brought here are the only population of dispersed African slaves that actually increased in population . Something like 800 to 900 thousand that have increased to a population of some 33 million . No where else in the world or New World did that happen . They were largely dying nearly as quick as they could be brought in to South and Central America and the Caribbean . Those two statements say a lot about America and the South . Slaves built large portions of New Amsterdam (NYC) Washington DC and Philadelphia, even Independence Hall . So if slavery was indeed a travesty for the African (which I seriously doubt) it was an American one, not just a Southern one .     </p>

<p>I would take issue with that. Not all of the slave traders were located in the South. Nor were they Southerners (or even Americans).  Anyway, during colonial times, &#8220;the South&#8221; had little to say about it, whether they liked the situation  or not.  Soon after independence was achieved, any further importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited. After that, it was just internal increase from there on. The fact that the black population has mushroomed from then to now, without the aid of any immigration at all, is proof of how good they have had it in North America, despite all their complaining.</p>

		<p>     Poster 34, slave population did increase dramatically from 1790 to 1810 . But that increase was overwhelmingly due to slave births not importation . Importation was banned by the U.S in 1808, but now hold on to your pants, importation was banned by Georgia in 1798 . And you are right, demand for the slaves also increased, specifically because of the cotton gin . Because it was Eli&rsquo;s little invention that allowed cotton to become King . A hand powered one would do the work of 50 slaves in separating the fibers from the seed . You can imagine what one powered by a large draft animal would do . And Northern industrialist and shippers were ecstatic about it, not to mention British textile mills . Before Eli&rsquo;s gin came along, cotton was a minor crop . But now a little food for thought, I am nearly 60 and my wife is well into her 50s, we are white . Both of my parents, both of her parents and all of our aunts and uncles, all picked cotton . And most of our grandparents and great aunts and uncles were share croppers at one time or another .  </p>
