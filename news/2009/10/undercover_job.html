<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover">Undercover Job Hunters Reveal Huge Race Bias in Britain&rsquo;s Workplaces</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rajeev Syal, Guardian (Manchester), October 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Civil servants created false identities to send CVs [curricula vitae or resumes] to hundreds of employers in sting to uncover discrimination</p>
<p>A government sting operation targeting hundreds of employers across Britain has uncovered widespread racial discrimination against workers with African and Asian names.</p>
<p>Researchers sent nearly 3,000 job applications under false identities in an attempt to discover if employers were discriminating against jobseekers with foreign names. Using names recognisably from three different communities  &mdash;  Nazia Mahmood, Mariam Namagembe and Alison Taylor  &mdash;  false identities were created with similar experience and qualifications. Every false applicant had British education and work histories.</p>
<p>They found that an applicant who appeared to be white would send nine applications before receiving a positive response of either an invitation to an interview or an encouraging telephone call. Minority candidates with the same qualifications and experience had to send 16 applications before receiving a similar response.</p>
<p>The alarming results have prompted Jim Knight, the employment minister, to consider barring companies that have been found to have discriminated against employees from applying for government contracts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspected there was a problem. This uncovers the shocking scale of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Candidates with an Asian or African name face real discrimination and this has exposed the fact that companies are missing out on real talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers from the National Centre for Social Research, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pension (DWP), sent three different applications for 987 actual vacancies between November 2008 and May 2009. Nine occupations were chosen, ranging from highly qualified positions such as accountants and IT technicians to less well-paid positions such as care workers and sales assistants.</p>
<p>All the job vacancies were in the private, public and voluntary sectors and were based in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, London and Manchester. The report, to be released tomorrow, concludes that there was no plausible explanation for the difference in treatment found between white British and ethnic minority applicants other than racial discrimination.</p>
<p>It also finds that public sector employers were less likely to have discriminated on the grounds of race than those in the private sector.</p>
<p>One reason for this discrepancy, according to the conclusion, is the use of standard application forms in the public sector which hide or disguise the ethnicity of an applicant. The research is also understood to have found that larger employers were less likely to discriminate than small employers.</p>
<p>Researchers have refused to release the names of the guilty employers, but it is expected that they will be contacted to let them know they had been targeted.</p>
<p>The report has been welcomed by senior race advisers as evidence of discrimination in the job market. Iqbal Wahhab, chair of the Ethnic Minority Advisory Group, which proposes policy changes for the government on race and employment, said: &#8220;The evidence of the DWP report is unquestionable  &mdash;  we live in a society where racial discrimination systematically occurs and currently goes in the main unchallenged.&#8221; Wahhab, an entrepreneur, said that the employers should not be &#8220;named and shamed&#8221; but persuaded to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The employers who fell foul of the DWP CV test are not bigots  &mdash;  they are business people. I don&rsquo;t suggest we slap injunctions on them and probably not even name and shame them, but instead we should help them understand that their current practices mean they are not fit to supply big customers like government departments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The findings echo the experience of black and Asian jobseekers contacted this weekend. James Nkwacha, 28, a physics graduate whose family are from Nigeria, said he has applied for 60 jobs this year but had only two replies. &#8220;The jobs are within my range. I am qualified for them. But for some reason I have been overlooked,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Navdeep Sethia, 24, an unemployed architecture graduate from Chalk Farm, central London, has submitted more than 400 job applications, but has only heard back from 40 employers and has had fewer than 20 interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally feel that my foreign-sounding name makes a lot of difference. I am sure employers think of Southall when they see my name and that is enough for them to put my application aside,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Peter Luff, the Conservative chairman of the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, praised the survey as a worthwhile exercise  &mdash;  as long as the companies that have been targeted were not exposed to public ridicule.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conclusions are indeed deeply disturbing and indicate the probability of significant discrimination which will have to be analysed closely once the full report is released this week,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think this was a good exercise by the government, and on balance was worth the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abigail Morris, employment policy adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce, said the research was flawed. &#8220;There are limitations to the results. The researchers only used nine occupations, and I am not sure that the number of replies they received is a representative sample. We are concerned that the results will be interpreted to say that most employers are racist, whereas they prove no such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morris also questioned whether the government should be involved in using a &#8220;sting operation&#8221; to uncover racism in the middle of a recession and whether it was worth the money. &#8220;Business is struggling with the worst recession for a generation. Is this really the time to be wasting government resources and the time of hard-pressed companies with fake CVs?&#8221; she asked.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure the reason that businesses are looking to hire native Brits is that they are not going to demand changes in the company&rsquo;s culture or policies, this especially applies to muslims.  You are also less likely to be sued for racial discrimination.  Sometimes these things are not about racism, but<br>
just wanting to hire someone who is not going to cause disruptions or problems for the company.</p>
<p>The reason the public sector saw less of this so called &#8220;racism&#8221; is that the public sector is most likely filled with the <b><br>
same ethnic minorities.</b><br>
 Of course they are going to hire their own.  That little quirk of human nature is acceptable if you are not white. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing when the papers are going to bother to investigate discrimination against whites considering there&rsquo;s and atmosphere and indeed it is the law, to discriminate against them in favor of others. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Did they try this on non-white employers&#8221;?</p>
<p>lol  Yeah, integration and tolerance only seem to work one way. Non-whites are proud of their efforts to exclude whites. </p>

		<p>The workplace is more than just a place where work gets done for a wage. People also interact, have lunch together, help each other professionally, and form friendships. I prefer to spend my time with fellow whites because its a way of helping my ethnic group. I only have so much time and energy to invest in contacts and prefer to focus on whites. I think employers are aware of this and prefer to have a homogeneous workplace as it leads to more cohesion among employees.</p>

<p>Keep Chinese from hiring Chinese and blacks from hiring blacks? Then how would they give back, make a difference in the community, and celebrate &#8216;diversity&rsquo;? That would be an intrusion on their civil rights. Goodness knows these groups have suffered enough already. That&rsquo;s some narrow, provincial, European thinking. (sarcasm off)</p>

		<p>Just go into any ethnic business and you will hardly ever see a white employee. Never in a shop or food establishment. </p>
<p>Several years ago a review of employment policies in &#8220;Indian &#8220;restaurants was promised.</p>
<p>It never came to anything as Labour was scared off by the Muslim community objections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK to discriminate against whites in the UK, their own country. In fact it has government approval.</p>

		<p>One point that is overlooked is whereas the qualifications on paper may be identical, with pervasive affirmative action in education and employment, employers know the qualitative difference between a white and non-white with the same credentials.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t a native Brit give a job to a fellow Brit over a foreigner anyway? If Nigerians feel discriminated against in Great Britain then go back to Nigeria. It&rsquo;s still there. British airports have just as many departures as they do arrivals.</p>

		<p>Fake test. Fake results. The real test is the millions of Whites who apply for jobs and are passed over because they are White. <br>
There is discrimination against Whites. </p>

		<p>you&rsquo;re in a predominately and historically white land. You have no business living there in the first place.  Sorry if that&rsquo;s mean and makes me sound like a bigot, but I&rsquo;m tired of the West letting in millions of people every year who have nothing in common with us whatsover, and yet they have the nerve to complain about us.  </p>

<p>This is all too true.  I work in a 300 person organization in Canada and recently had half of our cafeteria turned into a Muslim &#8220;prayer room&#8221;.  I now eat lunch at my desk&hellip;</p>

		<p>Perhaps the employers sensed the applications were false, detected some sort of scam?  There could be other reasons that these apps were rejected.</p>
<p>And how about creating false apps and sending them to non-white employers?  Might be interesting - what do you think?</p>

		<p>Why not just use fake &#8220;ethnic&#8221; names on various resumes and CVs? That way, at least you get a call once in a while from a prospective employer&hellip;Just keep your &#8220;Mohammed&#8221; sorted out from your &#8220;Levrontrocus&#8221;&hellip; and, I guess, have the wardrobe that matches the name.</p>

<p>Ok, in any muslim country, who would they hire &#8220;Nazia Mahmood&#8221; or &#8220;Alison Taylor&#8221; and in any African country, who would they hire, &#8220;Mariam Namagembe&#8221; or &#8220;Alison Taylor&#8221;? We all know the answer to that one.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve applied for many a frontline customer service, sales type job where I&rsquo;ve been told directly that the fact I only speak English is a disadvantage.<br>
As the employer is looking to service their multicultural customer base i.e. they need translators and don&rsquo;t want to pay extra for an outside provider.<br>
And then you speak to the people that they did hire and though communication is their main function, I can barely understand their spoken English.</p>
<p>And on the subject of &#8216;what&rsquo;s in a name.&rsquo;<br>
When we had our local Bush Fire tradegy Telethon a while back. <br>
I was reading the names of the donors scrolling along the bottom of the screen and I had to remark to my partner that it read like a Medieval English job list with names like &hellip;..<br>
Knight (also the name of the employment minister in this article), Baker, Smith, Steward, Cooper, Bower, Carpenter, Chaplain, Constable, Fletcher, Porter, Gardener, Marshal, Page, Cook, Potter, Reeve and there was a sprinkling of Greek, Italian and Asian names too.<br>
Names are important.</p>
