<h1>Yes, There Is Racism Against Indians in This Country</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Giago (Nanwica Kciji), Belleville News-Democrat (Illinois), October 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A column by Raina Kelley, a black lady, in Newsweek caught my eye this week. She wrote about the code words used to hide the unvarnished racism that seems to be permeating the American scene.</p>
<p>Less known in most of America, but well known to American Indians, is the covert racism that afflicts those Americans with &#8220;red skin&#8221; as opposed to black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And in those regions of the United States we call &#8220;Indian country,&#8221; there are few Indians who have not experienced the covert, and oftentimes overt, symptoms of racism. To many easterners coming out west to experience a close encounter of the first kind with &#8220;Indians,&#8221; it is so easy for them to slip into using the captivating term, &#8220;our Indians.&#8221; It is almost as if Indians are property, albeit human property, to be possessed by those who would observe, pity, assist or praise them as figments of a vanishing race. Indians can then be safely relegated to the role of mascots for America&rsquo;s fun and games. They can then be honored for what &#8220;they used to be&#8221; not for what they are today in modern America. They become warriors, chiefs, redskins and braves, everything but human beings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like Raina Kelly, many American Indians are mad as hell and they aren&rsquo;t going to take it anymore. Like the movie that coined this phrase, it is easily said, but hard to implement. Why? America does not want to hear about Indians. They should be left in the pages of history books or in old Western movies. America is not ready for the &#8220;tame&#8221; Indian because there are still many &#8220;shoot &#8216;em up&#8221; Western movies on the horizon and Americans do not want to destroy this false image with reality.</p>
<p>But let a few Indians occupy a peaceful village like Wounded Knee and the press shows up in droves. Visions of &#8220;shoot &#8216;em up&#8221; scenes of the cavalry (FBI) and Indians flood the stories they send back to the home office. The renegades waving rifles in the air make the nightly news.</p>
<p>Just what is racism? Some of it is indeed hateful and meant to hurt. Other aspects of it are strictly from ignorance. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t change stupid,&#8221; was in the title of a column written for Native Sun News by Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, a member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, a couple of weeks ago. Liz has seen the top and the bottom of racism, not only in South Dakota but in all of America. {snip}</p>
<p>But how are we going to change stupid if we don&rsquo;t keep trying? My weekly column on indianz.com, nativetimes.com, or on Pechanga.net, is read mostly by Indians who know Indian Country and respond accordingly. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let me conclude with, yes, there is racism against Indians in much of America and like the racism against blacks; it needs to be dragged out from under the rug and addressed.<br>

		<p>I have no problem with this. The ideas here or with Raina Kelley, Tim Giago, or the Belleville News-Democrat. No problem at all, as long as they are just as eager to address racism against whites, something that&rsquo;s more prevalent, business as usual, and even something rewarded. Heck, simply reprint an exact duplicate of this article, but place the word &#8216;white&rsquo; in each place the word &#8216;indian&rsquo; or &#8216;Native American&rsquo; is used and this article itself would be seen as the biggest proof of &#8216;racism&rsquo; of all.</p>

We have the same issue with Native Americans as we do with Blacks.</p>
<p>They want to be considered part of the mainstream but they insist on maintaining their heritage and identity.</p>
<p>The result is that they make themselves into stereotypes.</p>
<p>In the few movies and tv dramas I&rsquo;ve seen that revolved around Native Americans, there were always aspects of the story that perpetuated Native American spiritual mumbo-jumbo. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect me to consider you just like me if you insist on being different from me.<br>

		<p>Ironic that the group that comprises the largest in America is the one group that experiences the most discrimination - WE WHITES.<br>
Also ironic is the fact that it is WE WHITES that have NO organizations to represent us.  Further adding to the poignancy is the fact that most Whites are in a state of denial and continually run from one neighborhood to another and never admit - even to themselves - the real reason why.</p>
<p>If most of us don&rsquo;t wake the heck up, we aren&rsquo;t going to survive this century.</p>

		<p>Since Whites have trended to become fewer in numbers in relation to the total population, &#8220;Black&#8221; activists have tried to hang onto the shirt tails of Latinos, using cries of &#8220;Blacks and Hispanics&#8221;. Now that the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; have found that won&rsquo;t work, does this mean we will be subjected to cries of &#8220;Blacks and Indians&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Again I must state my opinion that the Indians can say and claim whatever they want.  They were here first.  The explorers showing up were like Black people migrating into a nice neighboorhood.  The truth is us white folks weren&rsquo;t all that civilized when we first showed up.</p>

		<p>American Indians actually enjoy a legal status that is unique among all other peoples in the world. They are both at the same time citizens of the United States and citizens of their own sovereign Indian nations.</p>
<p>When you travel onto an Indian resrvation, you are leaving the U.S. and entering the sovereign territory of a foreign power.</p>
<p>Unique rights they solely possess. And a white cannot become a member of the tribe, NO MATTER WHAT, EVER!!</p>
<p>American Indians are a super-citizen, a class unto themself, possessing rights a whitey does not have, AND NEVER CAN HAVE.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the complaint therefore would be!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a catch-22. And a bit of the &#8216;damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t&rsquo; or the ole&rsquo; White = Bad, Black = Good. After a constant lifetime barrage of &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; in classrooms and the media, painting minorities as magical special victims, it&rsquo;s no surprise many whites treat non-whites differently, and make a point to say, for example, how many black or Asian friends they have. Then this too, basically whites favoring non-whites, is held up as proof of more white racism and insensitivity. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know of anyone that doesn&rsquo;t think of them (indians) as human beings&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where only &#8216;victims&rsquo; as the author tries to paint indians here, are treated as human beings. Frankly, it&rsquo;s a kind of &#8216;racism&rsquo; of it&rsquo;s own. Indians are considered a victim group. It&rsquo;s no surprise many whites automatically object to native american activism even if, like me, they really don&rsquo;t know anything about Indians and even if they can&rsquo;t put their objections into words. If anything, their reaction is one of opposition to racism. </p>

		<p>Give me a break&hellip; racism is hardly as all-pervasive against Indians as this article would imply. Nor does our getting a &#8220;kick&#8221; out of an old shoot-em-up cowboy and Indian western automatically imply we&rsquo;re recists.</p>
<p>If truth be told, certainly there is more than enough blame to be heaped on BOTH sides. Early Europeans were guilty of shoving Indians off coveted lands by strength of arms. Indians were primitive nomads for the most part. With Indian &#8220;sport&#8221; often being battles with other Indian tribes. With captives subjected to an excruciating slow death by torture.</p>
<p>If anything at all, White (European) expansion in what became America is simply a valid demonstration of Darwin&rsquo;s &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; theory. A weaker racial group (Indians) pushed back into near oblivion by a much stronger race, many times better fitted to make use of the conquered land area.</p>
<p>Those claims of genocide are partially true. As are the many horror stories of brutal attacks and killings of White settler families in frontier areas. BOTH sides deserve blame for the warfare between Whites and Indians. So let&rsquo;s drop the hypocrisy of dumping all blame on Whites.</p>
<p>This smacks of those stupid claims by Chinese that Whites (British, for the most part) exploited them every which way. While that claim might have some validity&hellip; these claimants tend to forget the incredible wealth of knowledge, technology and medical knowledge China and other &#8220;exploited&#8221; nations received since those early days. Benefiting handsomely from all those centuries of learning and progress by White Europeans (and later Americans)&hellip; virtually FOR FREE! Something none of these people from &#8220;exploited&#8221; nations are willing to admit.</p>

		<p>As someone who is Amerind, I&rsquo;d like to clarify something: the vast vast vast majority of us ARE assimilated. we do Powwows like the Irish do St Patricks or Germans do Oktoberfest&hellip; it is a way to remember our heritage. ALL Amerinds speak English. Some also speak ancestral tongues.</p>
<p>as for &#8220;blacks and Indians&#8221;, we don&rsquo;t want &#8216;em either. witness the uproar a few years ago, when the Cherokee finally got rid of the &#8220;freed slaves&#8221;. In order to be US citizens, they were forced to count the freed slaves as members.  that was finally rectified by majority vote. they were voted off the rez. </p>
<p>and the vast vast vast majority of Amerinds are Christians. Very very very few follow ancestral religions, and most of those are actually &#8216;breeds, or wannabes. Don&rsquo;t believe everything you hear about Indian politics. Most of us do NOT live on reservations, drink, or do &#8220;sweats&#8221;.  We just want to live our lives. The most vocal anti-American Amerinds are the Sioux. the rest of us LIKE being Americans! </p>

		<p>As far as &#8220;claimed&#8221; discrimination in the workplace goes for American Indians&hellip; call it excuses. I worked with a printing plant manager   &mdash;   Who happened to be a full-blooded Navajo. Another Indian was Chief Halftown of Philadelphia. Who had a TV show for kids for decades. And there are other success stories.</p>
<p>But like so many Blacks&hellip; claiming discrimination is a hell of a lot easier than getting your act together. Getting yourself at least a high school diploma with reasonable grades&hellip; then getting off your butt and applying for a job.</p>
<p>Sure, there is some job discrimination&hellip; but most companies are smart enough to realize the COST of attendant litigation and bad publicity is far less onerous to them than hiring Blacks OR Indians&hellip; if the applicants indeed are qualified.</p>
<p>But like I said, discrimination is the perfect excuse for one&rsquo;s own unwillingness to actually WORK for a living. Like those Katrina evacuees in our Houston area&hellip; most of which are still on welfare.</p>

		<p>regardless of extremist views of some of them, I think that Indians are natural allies for whites in the fly-over country when the push comes to shove. The fact that they have special territorial rights that the pushy federal government so far is constrained to respect is only for the better. Local rights are essential for keeping tyranny at bay. And hopefully whites who live there or near there would benefit from this as well.</p>

<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s DNA and archaeological evidence that ice-age Solutreans from the area of modern France were here thousands of years before the paleo-indians crossed the land bridge from Asia. In other words, white Europeans were here first, or at least they were here before the &#8220;native americans.&#8221;  </p>

<p>American Indians tend to be somewhat sympathetic of the plight of white Southerners, and probably have the least antipathy to Confederate Battle Flags and other Southern heritage symbols than other minority groups.  I think they think they have a common adversary, the Yankee government.</p>
<p>I think Indian-Dixie relations were somewhat better than the rest of the country because most white Southerners have Indian in them.  The reason is that white exploration parties through what is now GA, AL and MS were only of men; very few if any came.  Indian women were the only ones around when those &#8220;urges&#8221; inevitably came about.  The offspring were mostly accepted back into white families, as Indian genetics are recessive to whites&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I have known a number of Amerinds personally during my life and even dated a few in my younger years.  The problem I find in them is that they cannot integrate intellectually.  They seem to steep themselves in a basic sort of anti-white psychology.  They will talk to you and look into your blue eyes and say, &#8220;The White Man did this, The White Man did that,..&#8221; as if it is some sort of evil spirit that has no material body.  They tend to not value things we think are normal, such as education, order, as in management of resources.  Indians have for example, hunting rights and what they care about is being able to take game with no regard to the survival of the particular game, and they have no problem using the highest of white technology in doing that.  </p>
<p>I know that this is a generalization, but the bottom line is that there is a basic laziness that relies on racist as an excuse.  But we know from history that many 19th century uprisings, at least the famous Minnesota Uprising of 1862 that led to the final Indian Wars of the late 19th century was due to the tardy delivery of promised supplies of food, etc., from the Federal Government, which was stalled due to arguments in Congress over funding (there was a war on).  The murders, rapes and atrocities against white settlers enraged the East and set the motion for the final suppression of the Indians.</p>
<p>We have done what we can to revive them and improve their lot, going as far as allowing them major gambling franchises in just about every state (as far as I know).  Gambling is one of the easiest ways to make money, short of simply stealing it (IMO).  Yet, they fight over it among themselves and will not share, adopting - at least - the capitalism of the white man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate the Amerind, I think they are unique in the national situation and are our &#8220;charges&#8221; so to speak.  We ought to deal with them as generously and kindly as possible.  But if they think that the coming non-white majority is going to benefit them better, they ought to think it over seriously.  The fact is that the &#8220;white man&#8221; is the best friend the Indian has ever had, and is likely to ever have.</p>

		<p>&#8220;American Indians tend to be somewhat sympathetic of the plight of white Southerners&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is this because indian tribes held black slaves in America? A fact that&rsquo;s convienently overlooked in our diversity obsessed classrooms, even when the subject is &#8216;slavery&rsquo; or even the native american tribe that held slaves. Especially then.  </p>

		<p>   My wife has more than enough Cherokee blood to be a registered member of the nation. So do my children. The Cherokee more than any other tribe adapted to the arrivial of whites and were mistreated as badly as any other tribe by the government of the time. My wifes&rsquo; family doesn&rsquo;t trade on their ancesty. It is their history, but they live in the present. Blacks should get over the slavery thing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Actually, there&rsquo;s DNA and archaeological evidence that ice-age Solutreans from the area of modern France were here thousands of years before the paleo-indians crossed the land bridge from Asia. In other words, white Europeans were here first, or at least they were here before the &ldquo;native americans.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, white Europeans weren&rsquo;t even &#8220;white&#8221; until 6,000 or so years ago, unless you&rsquo;re suggesting that Australoids are your cousins.</p>
<p>Solutrean hypothesis has been debunked, by the way. The closest relatives to those in the Northeast Americas are Altaians, who are not in the least bit &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement with posts 19 and 20. I&rsquo;m predominantly Eastern Cherokee, and another comment on here is perfectly on target with most southern people having at least some Native ancestry. I found the hatred for Natives to be more prevalent in the Northeastern US, especially among Italian-Americans. Why, I&rsquo;ll never know, but they&rsquo;re much more racist in the North toward Cherokee people and other Native groups.</p>

		<p>   The worse thing that ever happened to the Indians was their becoming wards of the federal government. It never should have happened to them. Government dependency has stifled initiative, led to laziness, and created widespread alcoholism and a host of other social pathologies. We can see this in other minorities. </p>
<p>Over time, many of the more enterprising Indians left the reservation/tribal areas and blended into white society. Particularly, in the 19th Century most Indians, who had adapted to white society, tried to downplay their origins. It&rsquo;s only become fashionable in the last sixty years for whites to claim Indian ancestry. During earlier centuries, Indian ancestry was denied more than celebrated. However, today so many whites claim Cherokee ancestry, I&rsquo;m skeptical that any full bloods remain.<br>

		<p>Shoot &#8216;em up movies about Indians?  Not for 40 years, or more.  The writer is the one trafficking in obsolete images.  If anyone can rightly said to hold annoying stereotypes, it would be those New Age liberals, like the ones who pay very high prices for Genuine Native American Dogs (sterile, of course), which have spiritual qualities beyond the ken of mere hounds and terriers.  Or like those two White fools who died in a sweat lodge near Sedona, Arizona, while seeking enlightenment ($4500 each) about a week ago.  </p>

		<p>Actually, while you&rsquo;re right in one regard, Sardonicus, there are quite a few Eastern Band Cherokee who are predominantly of Native ancestry, if not entirely Native. I&rsquo;m half, and the other half is Irish  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the most common scenario with us. In Oklahoma it&rsquo;s another story, they adopted so many non-Cherokee customs and married members of other tribes, so they&rsquo;re more mixed-blood than we are.</p>
