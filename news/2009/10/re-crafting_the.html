<h1>Re-Crafting the United States as Disunited Duchies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lewis Beale, Miller-McCune Online Magazine, October 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America is disuniting on the basis of race, politics and culture, say the authors of two recent books. Many are fleeing to what one calls &#8220;whitopia.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho, where 95 percent of the population is white, Rich Benjamin saw more Confederate flags than black people. Not that Benjamin was looking for suggestions of racism, but in his forthcoming book, Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America (Hyperion, Oct. 6), he was trying to discover why some of the fastest-growing areas in America are also the most Caucasian.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a long-term harm when Americans accept balkanization as a way of life,&#8221; says Benjamin, who is an African American. &#8220;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run. Optimal democracies require more than voting; they require social integration and involvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin defines Whitopias as towns that are much whiter than the nation as a whole, which means they are more than 75 percent Caucasian. He looked at areas with a population growth of more than 6 percent since 2000, in which the growth was 90 percent white. Then he set out to Forsyth County, Ga., (98,000 people, 684 of them black), St. George, Utah, Coeur d&rsquo;Alene and other vanilla outposts to find out why folks were moving there.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are forces that push people out [of cities and inner suburbs], like diversity and crumbling infrastructure and high home prices,&#8221; Benjamin says. &#8220;And there are pull factors, like more home for your dollar [in the whitopias], beautiful natural amenities and safety, and the perceived comfort that comes with homogeneity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This situation, Bishop [Bill Bishop, author of The Big Sort] says, has its good and bad points. &#8220;The good part is you get this incredible variety from place to place; places zoom off into their own cultural trajectories. But what happens is people lose touch with those who disagree with them. What happens is a nation incapable of compromise; you have this kind of national stalemate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now that many of those inner suburbs have become increasingly minority, a significant number of whites have fled further out to what Benjamin refers to as &#8220;exurban&#8221; counties like Forsyth (an hour&rsquo;s drive north of Atlanta), which are 83 percent non-Hispanic white.</p>
<p>Yet Benjamin says he found &#8220;racism without racists&#8221; in these towns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I very much believe we do have structural racism in our communities, yet we don&rsquo;t have racists. The good news is we don&rsquo;t have interpersonal racism. But structural racism is harder to attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin also notes that a significant proportion of the people moving to these white enclaves are older folks with specific fears and agendas. And the Obama presidency has only heightened those qualms and, in some cases, brought out nativist impulses.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the tea bag protests, and the birther movement, this is an existential crisis facing conservative white Americans,&#8221; Benjamin says. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to expand government dependence, and they link big government to city people and minorities who are perceived to be on the dole. These Americans are fearing where the country is going economically, racially and government-wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>That 40 percent of Americans under 24 are non-white, and that whites will no longer be in the majority by 2042, only serves to make this unease more palpable. So in the near future &#8220;there may be a democracy gap where older whites, who are more inclined to vote, have the power to determine the outcome of politics,&#8221; Benjamin says. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bishop believes that the crazy quilt of cultures and values the big sort has created just &#8220;makes any sort of national change harder. We get by, but what we lack is an ability to do things that are transformative. {snip}</p>

		<p>The old adage will always be true - one black family is a neighbor, two is a ghetto. Whites, even the bleeding hearts, know intuitively that blacks in the neighborhood ALWAYS means trouble sooner or later. The patterns of white-flight in one form or another haven&rsquo;t changed very much in half a century!   </p>

		<p>Obviously, the next step is to import more minorities into places like Coeur D&rsquo;Alene, Idaho and St. George, Utah.</p>
<p>For a lib to complain about balkanization is the height of hypocrisy.  Would they go to places that have become lib enclaves, such as Boulder, Colorado, that have become liberal enclaves thanks to the vicious cycle of (1) A place being liberal to begin with, (2) Thereby attracting crazier libs, and (3) The place becomes even crazier lib?  </p>
<p>BTW, a publication that passes itself off as respectable shouldn&rsquo;t have editors that approve of insults like &#8220;tea bag&#8221; as a pejorative entendre for the National Tea Party Movement.</p>

		<p>Well everything that Benjamin says is all well and fine and good but I didn&rsquo;t see where he cited any examples of places or societies anywhere and at any time in history where his vision of a multi-ethnic/multi-racial/multi-worldview society ever played out to be the kind of scenario in which one would &#8220;want to raise their children in&#8221;. </p>

		<p> &#8220;Vanilla outposts&#8221;? Would this writer refer to inner city areas as &#8220;chocolate outposts&#8221;? He also says that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is one of the forces pushing Whites out of metropolitan areas. Diversity   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s Latin for &#8220;lawless, shiftless blacks,&#8221; isn&rsquo;t it? Heaven forbid we should say what we really mean, or voice unpleasant, politically incorrect truths!</p>
<p> Balkanization? The Balkan nations got along better when they were separate entities. Having all races and ethnic groups living cheek-by-jowl among each other is not something that will occur without coercion in this country, and the sooner we face up to that, the better.  </p>

		<p>For 30 years I lived in a &#8216;mixed&rsquo; neighborhood UNTIL I finally got it thru my thick skull that Race does indeed matter. Now I live in a community composed 90% or more of my own Folk. Safer, Cleaner Better all around. My former &#8216;neighbors&rsquo; back in the &#8216;hood are frankly on their own. I owe them nothing further. 30 years of trying to make the fraud of diversity work to accomodate the dark skinned people is enough for me.</p>

		<p>All hail Whitopia, land that I love!</p>
<p>This is still America, and theoretically we have the right to live where we want.  If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to live amongst thuggish suburghetto types, what right does ANYBODY have to try and make me? </p>
<p>The Left sowed the seeds of America&rsquo;s Balkanization, and a bitter harvest lies ahead for everyone involved.  It is the end result of multiculturalism, EXACTLY as those mean old hateful White racists predicted 40 years ago.</p>
<p>I found the following Benjamin quote quite interesting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Optimal democracies require more than voting; they require social integration and involvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah?  Says who?  I happen to believe we had an optimal democracy right here in America until about 1957, and if the USA was still 90% White we would still have one.  </p>
<p>Social integration?  No thanks, keep it all for yourself Benjamin, and enjoy the societal failure that will result.  Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll be happily pursuing my own life in Whitopia.</p>

		<p>Whitopia? Ha! No such thing. Any place that is all white is by definition racist and needs to be made diverse. The fastest-growing areas in America are not entirely populated by race realists. Many of those places have their fair share of white liberals who insist on living in communities that aren&rsquo;t 100% white. </p>
<p>Balkanization is used as a pejorative term for a very specific reason. That reason is because it does not refer to the natural segregation of people preferring to live by those similar to them. It refers to the harsh reaction people show towards being made to live in a society they never wished to live in. The current hostile reaction to the changing face of our nation is the result of liberals trying to change our nation into some unrealistic utopia. America could be free of racial tensions if white people were allowed to live as they wish without being insulted. It is possible to live separate from people without hating them. But if you insult people and try to make live like they do not wish to live it is inevitable you will be disliked.</p>

<p>The only thing Mr. Benjamin is concerned with is that when whites leave, they take their clean, safe, and prosperous communities with them.</p>
<p>This is a 21st century argument for revitalizing &#8216;the white mans burden&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man's_Burden" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man&rsquo;s_Burden</a></p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin is keenly aware that without whites, non-whites are a hopeless lot and that the only hope for non-whites is hitch  themselves to whites.</p>
<p>This social experiment has failed everywhere, every time and whites no longer want this burden.</p>

		<p>To this man, structural racism exists anywhere White people seek self-determination.  White people living as White people is racist to him, even if it&rsquo;s in a place where Whites are native.  In their view, it&rsquo;s simply immoral for us be fee of the burden of non-Whites.</p>

<p>Note: By &#8220;whitopia&#8221;, he means those areas where the population is almost entirely working/lower-middle class conservative whites, <i>not</i> where the upper-class Lefty whites who will buy this book live.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long-term harm when Americans accept balkanization as a way of life,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Speaking of the Balkans, I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here but can someone refresh my memory on which solved most of the conflict in the Balkans:<br>
* The forced collection of the various groups into an artifical state, or<br>
* The natural division of the aforementioned state into nations roughly corresponding to divisions by ethnicity, culture and religion?</p>
<p><i>says Benjamin, who is an African American.</i></p>
<p>Of course, any book on &#8216;black issues&rsquo; written by a white would have the usual cries of &#8216;<i>you don&rsquo;t know what being an &#8216;African-American&rsquo; is like, so you can&rsquo;t talk about us!</i>&rsquo; occur.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run.</i></p>
<p>Ah, engaging in the fantasy that &#8216;all racism is <i>pre</i>judicial&rsquo; I see:<br>
Must be a coincidence that &#8220;anti-illegal-immigration&#8221; sentiment among white communities is highest in the U.S. southwest as opposed to the northeast then.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There are forces that push people out [of cities and inner suburbs], like diversity and crumbling infrastructure and high home prices,&rdquo; Benjamin says. &ldquo;And there are pull factors, like more home for your dollar [in the whitopias], beautiful natural amenities and safety, and the perceived comfort that comes with homogeneity.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Of course, again it&rsquo;s just a coincidence that &#8220;diversity&#8221; coincides with &#8220;crumbling infrastructure&#8221; while &#8220;(white) homogeneity&#8221; coincides with &#8220;beautiful natural amenities&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The good part is you get this incredible variety from place to place; places zoom off into their own cultural trajectories. But what happens is <b>people lose touch with those who disagree with them</b>.</i></p>
<p>Mission-Control-to-Bishop, I&rsquo;d hate to point out the obvious but&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t that happen anyway?<br>
I wonder how many &#8220;conservatives&#8221; or &#8220;libertarians&#8221;  Mr. Bishop has among his close friends.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;When you look at the tea bag protests, and the birther movement, this is an existential crisis facing conservative white Americans,&rdquo; Benjamin says. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to expand government dependence, and they link big government to city people and minorities who are perceived to be on the dole. These Americans are fearing where the country is going economically, racially and government-wise.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Amend as follows:<br>
* Tea bag protests and birther movement - ghost dances and uprisings<br>
* Conservative white Americans - &#8220;uncivilised&#8221; Native Americans<br>
* Expanding government dependence and city people and minorities - expanding government control and white settlers<br>
* Ecomically/government-wise - environmentally/sovereignty-wise.</p>
<p>And hey presto! You have something that could&rsquo;ve come out of a 19th Century book on the &#8220;Native American decline&#8221;.</p>

<p>If 40 percent is admitted to by a government that consistently lies about racial statistics, the actual figure is probably higher. Who knows how much higher.</p>
<p>How then will it take 33 more years to accomplish this seemingly unstoppable minoritization of Whites? It won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend the inevitable is three decades in the future, that we have years more to ponder and discuss. It&rsquo;s here and now. If you do nothing else, at least face the demographic realities and plan ahead.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run.&#8221;  This fool has it totally upside down. The biggest mistake we made was in banning segregation. The second biggest mistake was elimination of European priority in immigration law. All stupid mistakes from the worst decade in US history, i.e., the Sixties. This author doesn&rsquo;t get it. Our civilization, white civilization, is better than black or Latino culture. Structural racism is a wonderful thing. May we have more of it. God bless Idaho.</p>

		<p>The country as a whole is marching down towards the abese. Political institutions: corrupt and inefficient. economy: trillions in debt with Chinese warning they may not finance the of cards called American economy  much longer. socially a mess. demographically: so much diversity that the place looks like more like U.N than U.S.  There are serious doubts among many that an Afro Chicano majority nation appearing in two decades will be able to bring America back to prosperity, peace and world stewardship. Even if the country scurvies as one piece it will be some thing between Brazil and hatii. <br>
Moral of story: Enjoy your time and life now. In less than three decades if you are alive you will be remembering these days as good old days of America! in Fifty years white will disappear alltogether and be replaced by mullato nation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run. Optimal democracies require more than voting; they require social integration and involvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Social integration and involvement are recipes for disasters, because there never has been nor will there ever be a multiracial society that is harmonious, nor will there ever be one that is free of conflict, especially if one of the mismatched groups is black.</p>
<p>Why blacks like this one constantly strives for integration is amazing in that his type is usually the first one to complain loudly and often about situations that exist ONLY in multiracial societies.</p>
<p>Every attempt to alter human nature has always ended in disaster, and this social engineerng project in the West is doomed to failure as well.  There are so many signs advertising its failure and imminent collapse it&rsquo;s amazing there is even one person advocating multiracialism.</p>
<p>I wish I could be alive to read the books a hundred years from now trying to explain why absolute fools were able to hoodwink a good portion of elites into believing such nonsense as &#8220;diversity their strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the multicult leaders will be regarded on a par with the biggest screw ups history has to offer.</p>

		<p>Will this ever stop? We have another black man lecturing Whites again! Don&rsquo;t tell us what to think or how to feel or that we should not feel threatened by the invasion of nonwhites! Nonwhites are a danger to any White society and we see it and live it everyday, so I guess it is all just an illusion and that we should just shut up and hand it all over to the nonwhites who are really just our &#8220;equals&#8221; and wish us no harm?

		<p>Would someone please explain to me how a town that is 95% White is somehow &#8220;racist&#8221; when Whites constitute the vast majority of the population is White and when a town is 95% Black it is somehow something to be preserved. Blacks are only about 13% of the US population so a town that is majority black would be far more racist (and dangerous) than a majority White town. </p>
<p>I would not recommend Coeur d&rsquo;Alene to anyone who did not have a permanent job offer or a profession in high demand. Anything other than this will have a hard time surviving. My husband and I lived there for several months in 2003 and it was difficult to find a job and a place to live. The locals who have been there for generations hate the newcomers and are often hostile. I have told my husband that CDA was one of the &#8220;meanest places I have ever been&#8221;. I had people try to start fights with me in the bathroom of a restaurant and had neighbors steal our dog. I would look for a better majority White city. </p>

<p><i>Benjamin says. &ldquo;And there are pull factors, like more home for your dollar [in the whitopias]</i></p>
<p>More home for your dollar? You can buy homes for $1 apiece in cities like Gary and Detroit. Nobody wants them. A home isn&rsquo;t worth a hill of beans if you&rsquo;re not safe in it.</p>
<p><i>safety, and the perceived comfort that comes with homogeneity. </i></p>
<p>Ah yes, it&rsquo;s only &#8220;perceived.&#8221; I guess most whites are just living in a dream state.</p>

<p>Finally, a grain of truth&hellip;and it comes from a white author (notice that almost everything from the black author was a slur or dig in some way against whites). The automobile has made it all too easy for white people to run away from the very serious problems confronting this nation, rather than being forced to address them before they become unmanageable, as is now happening in the US. Segregation is also the only thing that makes liberal hypocrisy possible. </p>

		<p>Given that blacks and hispanics claim to love their races so much, why would they care about those evil whites separating and living apart from them?</p>
<p>The answer is that many of these nonwhites want to live among us because their own neighborhoods are so unlivable. Their constant whining about being oppressed is a scam that they don&rsquo;t believe for a second.</p>

		<p>Mikefromwichita. I was intrigued by your history. I, too, grew up in minority White city (Cleveland, Oh), and while I didn&rsquo;t have it too bad as a kid, I&rsquo;d never move my wife and kid down there now. I&rsquo;m in one of those &#8220;inner suburbs&#8221; that this black columnist is talking about. The suburb is probably 90% white, a small mix of Chinese, some non-English speaking Eastern Europeans, some Indians, and a small (thank goodness) percentage of Muslims, mainly Arab. I always found it fascinating too, that the media doesn&rsquo;t talk about blacks not wanting to live with their own kind. They always come out to the White shopping malls, movie theaters, parks. Because we are more civilized. That&rsquo;s the truth. There are bad Whites, but the percentages are not even close. The ones that keep up their homes and property and are polite&hellip; That&rsquo;s one thing. But it&rsquo;s when they have cousins who have friends who like to cause trouble. Get your conceal carry. Whites will have to learn how to fire guns again.</p>

<p>I have often said that it is no coincidence that the civil rights movement only came along in the 60&rsquo;s, once america had a good road network and cheap gasoline. There were people agitating for it in previous decades as I understand it, but the movement was always going to be a no-go as long as whites lacked an easy way to escape.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens if/when cheap gasoline disappears, and governments cannot afford any more road projects. Probably they will auction off highways to toll companies in a desperate attempt to stay solvent, and the owners will charge what the market will bear. Whites will be forced to stand their ground, live close to work, and send their kids to nearby schools. Expect to see homeschooling flourish, and expect to at least see news stories about the rising popularity of neighborhood watch programs, white neighborhoods blaring classical music in the streets to ward off thugs, and so forth. </p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin of egalitarianism will be the continuing advances in genetic science. Genes for psychopathic personality disorder and so forth will be found, and discovered to be far more frequent in blacks and hispanic populations. The elites will be stripped of their intellectual fig leaves, and they will have no rational-sounding arguments left. (Granted, this may take decades, and a lot of ex-hippie marxist college professors may have to grow old and die off first.) I do not forsee a return to state-mandated segregation, but rather a repeal of anti-discrimination laws, leaving the choice of free association up to property owners  &mdash;  namely, neighborhood associations and employers. </p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>

		<p>On the subject of Obama&rsquo;s healthcare proposals, most White nations on Earth have some kind of socialized medicine system in which universal health coverage is somehow &#8216;guaranteed&rsquo; by the state.<br>
 As a matter of fact, these schemes are genuinely popular with the broad mass of the population.It is the nature of a socialized medicine scheme that, in the long run, sme individuals will contribute more than they take and others will take more than they contribute - but in the nations where such schemes exist this generally accepted as a &#8216;price worth paying&rsquo; and in general the big contributors don&rsquo;t resent the fact.<br>
 As many commentators have said this due to the racially homogenous status that these nations have (or had).Individuals are prepared to make sacrifices for those genetically related, but when large anatoginstic racial minorities are involved, socialized medicine is impossible.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But what happens is people lose touch with those who disagree with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we see on underlying principle of &#8220;liberalism&#8221;, that race determines one&rsquo;s attitudes and perspectives on life.  In other words, they believe that all whites think the same way and all blacks think a different way.  However, those same &#8220;liberals&#8221; are quick to deny that those different attitudes can be responsible of disparate average earnings, school performance, crime rates or disease rates.  The reason that they deny such a possibility is that admitting any connection between a &#8220;black culture&#8221; and black failure would mean that they might not be the result of white &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Since one of the tenets of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; is the white &#8220;racism&#8221; is a major cause of black failings, they find themselves, as usual, contradicting themselves:</p>
<p>a) There are &#8220;black attitudes&#8221; vs. &#8220;white attitudes&#8221;</p>
<p>b) Those attitudes have little or no impact on behavior</p>
<p>&hellip;therefore &#8220;attitude has no/little impact on behavior - an absurd position to hold.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a long-term harm when Americans accept balkanization as a way of life,&rdquo; says Benjamin, who is an African American. &ldquo;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run. Optimal democracies require more than voting; they require social integration and involvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem is that social integration with blacks can be very harmful to your life. I actually work in a very diverse environment-civil service in NYC (I actually live in outer Whitelandia, a commute that is both time consuming and exhausting, as well as expensive). The garbage that I have to put up with is amazing and disgusting. Promotions for white males are hard to come by while Afros are promoted way beyond their abilities, in fact many who shouldn&rsquo;t be employed actually earn a good deal of money although they are terrible employees. I also have to put up with Afro bullying-loud, noisy disrespectful co-workers singing to themselves, playing their music, holding high decibel level chit chat sessions while I&rsquo;m trying to work, and lastly expressing their anti-white political thoughts. This last annoyance is revealing in that I am under no illusions regarding what Afros want-they want the destruction of white society, but I already knew that, and not being able to express my views, that is I&rsquo;m straight-jacketed while the Afro bullies run wild, is upsetting to me to say the least.<br>
So it is no surprise to me that white people would want to head to a more homogeneous area. I&rsquo;m sure the brother who wrote the piece realizes this and his real point is to keep up the Afro Marxist War on Whitey.<br>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear possible, to me, for a non-democratic situation ( forced integration) to ever resolve into a democratic one. The initial premise carries a lot of argumentative weight.<br>
In the American constitution,if not tradtion, we have an understanding that &#8220;all men are equal&#8221;. Certainly, the idea of forced integration did not issue from that, as the majority would have to penalize its existence, and contradict its own statement, if it disempowered some of its members to advantage some other members on an elementary premise, freedom of association.<br>
The influence had to come from outside. <br>
I think a moment&rsquo;s thought will reveal its origin,namely Marxism. Marxism does not suggest all men are equal. Therefore it has no problem with dislocating some to benefit others; notice none of these people are considered citizens in the American sense. None have rights, nor will they ever.<br>
Is this what will happen to this country? A loss of rights?<br>
This is what the struggle is all about.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You can run but you can&rsquo;t hide.&#8221; Those whites who think that escape to a rural area is the answer don&rsquo;t seem to realize that there is a national culture which has pretty well smothered any local manifestations which may try to differ. Admittedly if you become a Mormon, and live in Utah, there is a pretty strong degree of differentiation, but I don&rsquo;t think Mormonism is going to be the answer to the greater ills of the majority of the whites living in the United States.</p>
<p>Aside from the negative cultural force of the mass media and entertainment industry, the educational system, both public and private, transmites the negative ideas of total equality among different racial groups and makes sure that fewer and fewer &#8220;Dead white males&#8221; are remembered or spoken highly of. (How many students in the present day are exposed to &#8220;Paul Revere&rsquo;s Ride,&#8221; for example?)</p>
<p>In short, older whites are going to have to start &#8220;taking the bull by the horns&#8221; and fighting a sort of modern day cultural counter-reformation that will create the conditions for the declining percentage of white youngstes entering educational age to not be further brainwashed by the kind of &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221;, of a mild or severe nature, which is going on in the educational system.</p>
<p>I could care less about the well being of older whites who want to escape to a sort of white &#8220;never-never land&#8221; in some isolated part of the U.S. so that they can live out their last decades of life outside the struggle. If you are in such a place and part of the counter-revolution to restore a decent future for tne newest generation of whites, now consigned to be the &#8220;low men and women on the totem pole&#8221; of multiculturalism fine - but if you are hiding from the fight then you are part of the problem, not part of the solution - and believe me, there still is a solution, notwithstanding those few who post on this site and have essentially given up trying to change things for the greater society.</p>

		<p>If Gary and Detroit are examples of Blacktopia, I&rsquo;ll take my chances with places like Coeur d&rsquo;Alene once society totally fractures. Our tax dollars are the primary thing propagating a lot of this nonsense. As Margaret Thatcher used to say, &#8220;The problem with Socialism is that you eventually run out of other people&rsquo;s money&#8221;. In a strange way, maybe we should welcome it when China cuts off the money tap and it will be impossible to keep the financial abominations going.  </p>
<p>Maybe the confederate flags are a partial symbol for Whitopia. If one travels to Beech Grove, Indiana (a separate city inside of Indianapolis), and drives into the neighborhoods, you will see a fair number of stars and bars flying. BG was primarily a railroad town in a past life and still has an Amtrak repair facility. When Judge Dillin started ordering busing, BG started receiving a number of new residents as students could not be bussed in or out of the town. A lot of police officers live there and are not shy about making this a safe community. You can walk around most of BG at 3:00 AM without fear. However, BG is not far from some really questionable areas of Indianapolis. </p>
<p>A number of the counties around Marion County, Indiana have been predominantly white since statehood, however their populations have exploded as forced diversity has been such a disaster. In Fishers, Indiana, there is a girl scout troop made up exclusively of girls adopted from China. Having seen the misery of trying to adopt a healthy white child and the roadblocks therein, I can&rsquo;t really blame white parents from adopting overseas. If white children are unavailable, Asian children are your next best option. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read &#8220;The Big Sort&#8221; and while I agree with some of it, there is this annoying underlying tone that almost sounds like Rodney King&rsquo;s &#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all just get along&#8221;. The overwhelmingly liberal areas, that probably have more gated communities than conservative areas, seem to be driven to apoplexy that not everyone wants to sign on with their vision of society. </p>

		<p>i can&rsquo;t help feel but the comments here are a little hysterical.America has a deep and involved racial history, so of course it&rsquo;s a factor in every major national event, including presidential elections. But with the farfetched, fantastical social-political forecasting here, it&rsquo;s guaranteed that anything that happens in the future will &#8216;indicate&rsquo; some future social trend, regardless. for instance, if obama loses his bid for reelection, undoubtedly posters here and at similar sites will reel off long-winded analyses about how &#8216;white america renounced the step toward black-rule that obama instigated,&rsquo; or, if he does take on a second term, undoubtedly this will, &#8216;signify America&rsquo;s further descent into a multi-culti socialist state,&rsquo; etc.   &mdash;  - I can practically see and hear all the overstated rhetoric already!<br>
How about this possibility? Maybe it both good and bad; maybe America is making racial progress for hte betterment of many American lives, while maybe some such trends are pushing us too far and too fast, and that the some bad will temper some of the good. <br>
What I mainly see is both the left and right becoming more apocalyptic in the ever-raging discontents,with each painting the other into a cariacaturized corner. <br>
So perhaps the best question each of us coud us of the other is: just who on your side is holding the brush?</p>

We, the descendants of the people who built this country and the ones who continue to sustain it, do not like to be chased out of the cities we built.  Even less do we enjoy being accused of malice because we object to the changes forced on us.  <br>
     So tell us, what good do you see in turning America from a White nation into a Third World melting pot?  Are their values superior to ours?  Have they a greater concern for the environment?  Will they treat Blacks with the respect that Whites do not?  Are they more law-abiding, more honest, less corrupt, less violent?  <br>
     You think that the apocalyptic words are overdoing it, but what has happened elsewhere when one people force themselves on another?  Perhaps you go to a college where the races seem to get along, or live in one of those boutique neighborhoods where housing costs keep the general run of riffraff out, but many of us here find ourselves unwillingly living and working amidst the more typical non-Whites.  Our views are mostly rooted in personal experience.  Our eyes see one thing, and the institutions of government, of learning, of public communication, all tell us something else.  We see no good coming out of the demographic transformation, and our suspicions are heightened by the lack of real public discourse.  Those who control the printing presses and airwaves seem to be blind to what is obvious to us, we think the blindness is intentional, and we can see no compromise with people who act in bad faith.  </p>

<p>Why is it necessary to keep in touch with people you disagree with? What are the benefits of that? From the time we&rsquo;re BORN we learn to compromise and that people don&rsquo;t always agree with each other. We hardly need, as adults, a black person lecturing us about their version of &#8216;compromise&rsquo;, which actually means changing our mind or giving in so they get their way.</p>

<p>&gt; This is so outrageous when we set it alongside the cry for diversity that blacks have been clamouring for going on decades now.  This man must be a communist in social theory at least.  He is utilizing the idea that if we force everyone together, a sameness will emerge that will eliminate injustice and promote equality.  The beating of that black honor student in Chicago by his own raical peers - along with the long legacy of black on black violence has to prove if they aren&rsquo;t willing to look any further than that for the proof, this this idea is completely erroneous and frankly impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a free country, people ought to be able to groups together based on anything they decide they have in common, including race.  The problem is keeping certain elements out.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t enough to reside somewhere where there are mostly whites, you&rsquo;ve got to understand much more temporal demographics.  You have to be smart enough, and energetic enough to be able to raise your children to get along with people, but not necessarily feel obligated to the varous greater social pressures to miscegenate, for example.  Because until whites can physically deny others from settling among them as they once did, the battle is inside the psyches of our children.  They need to be taught to be proud of who and what they are without all the rap and hip-hop, television culture that is wrecking America from top to bottom.  Quite a challenge.</p>

<p>Well, this is absolutely correct. NOW that the various cultural groups in the Balkans have separated and have their own contiguous and secure nation-states, the fighting and the ethnic cleansing has stopped. People are contented now and better off that they live among their own kind and not have the tension that existed under the surface before. Yugoslavia was presented as always being a place where different groups could live in harmony and be a model for the rest of the world. It was not true. With totalitarianism, the tension was still present but kept in check. </p>

		<p>In the relatively near future the borders of the North American land mass are going to be redrawn to unify, at least in a formal sense, the countries of Mexico, USA, and Canada. This development can be viewed as a total negative, but possibly it will present an oppotunity to redraw the borders of society. With borders and national identities in flux the time will be ripe for secession. If political secession will not be achievable the momentum for racial segregation will become stronger, as white people realize the government is not in any sense theirs, and no allegiance to its multicultural ethics is owed.</p>

It would be interesting to see if the whites could finish building theirs, before the blacks totally destroyed the one they were given. </p>
<p>In the end, it wouldn&rsquo;t prove much because the blacks and their Marxist apologists would claim that the city the blacks were given was a &ldquo;Eurocentric&rdquo; construction designed to &ldquo;oppress&rdquo; them and drive them insane, or some other such nonsense.

<p>Just as with Yugoslavia, or the Roman Empire, or the Ottoman Empire, or the USA!, it takes a STRONG and coercive central government to FORCE people to live together and MAKE them get along.

You are correct. Mainstream journalists and the common man uses caucasian and white as if they were interchangeable. While all whites are caucasians, not all caucasians are white. The USA is at present ~50% white while being ~65% caucasian. </p>
<p><a href="/ar/2002/01/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2002/01/index.html</a></p>
<p>I estimate that around 2050, giving the current forward projections, that the white amount of the US population will be around 20% while the caucasian being around 50%. By 2100 there will be approximatively 0% whites left in the USA. White flight has gone from being from neighbourhood to neighbourhood to county to county to state to state. Eventually it will be international but that route is not open to most americans. I guess most of those will end up in Australia or New Zealand. The rest will live a meager existence in some remote, cold montana hinterlands or live around the big cities and intermarry with various non white caucasians, of which there will be a big slew coming in from south america and north africa/middle east. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right! This is why blacks are the biggest proponents of &#8220;racially diverse communities&#8221; They realize better than anyone, that all black communities almost always have profound crime rates, and are unsafe to not only live in, but to pass through. This is exactly why, they seek out non-black communities, but especially white ones, because usually they are  the safest, cleanest, and most pleasant. They will always want in on that, and will continue to try and change the demographics of any mostly white community they can! That is, until those communities become as dangerous as the ones they left. Once white flight takes place, they search out the next once pleasant mostly white community to destroy.</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin, the crazy quilt IS the national change and the transformation.  It doesn&rsquo;t make change harder, it means that change has happened.  There is no more &#8220;we&#8221; as a complete nation.</p>
<p>Another point:  I don&rsquo;t accept in the first place an article in which a non-white seeks to analyze whites from the more legitimate position.  It reads like Benjamin is in the mainstream, analyzing these kooky whites who are fleeing the core of the country.  Anyone who tacitly accepts this juxtaposition has already capitulated.</p>
<p>Finally, this is poor reporting:  even without white flight, there are vast swaths of the country which have always been over 90% white, and many of these are in rural areas or in certain regions (like the intermountain West).</p>

The more you give to minorities, all minorities, the more they demand. How much longer will whites keep moving away? When will we say enough is enough? When will we make a stand? </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;All stupid mistakes from the worst decade in US history, i.e., the Sixties&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Feller:</p>
<p>I would rewind all the way back to the 30s, the socialist FDR and liberal SCOTUS as the beginning of the downward spiral.  Even though FDR lost in his attempt to pack the SCOTUS, according to Jim Powell:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;the Court that emerged from this struggle shifted on its own to a liberal attitude, making the US safe for the New Deal and where it would largely remain for another seven decades&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;There&rsquo;s a long-term harm when Americans accept balkanization as a way of life&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the US will become like the Balkans, but not for the reasons he thinks as he has little to no understanding of the history of that war-torn area of the world.</p>
<p>I cannot explain it better than historian Richard Maybury:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since the beginning of history this area has been inhabited by hundreds of nations, tribes and ethnic groups that have hated and fought each other constantly. Russia alone contains some 250 of these groups, and they know nothing of the legal principles that make an advanced, peaceful civilization possible.</p>
<p>Until 1991, the Kremlin sat on Chaostan like a lid on a pressure cooker. Now the lid is gone and the explosion has begun. The area is returning to its original condition of poverty and war &mdash; of chaos.</p>
<p>There are only three possible political conditions, liberty, tyranny or chaos. When a population is not dedicated to a legal system based on the two fundamental laws, their only choices are tyranny or chaos&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an explanation of the two fundamental laws:</p>
<p>Benjamin is but one of many useful idiots praised and lauded as a &#8216;visionary&rsquo; by academia and the government,  widely disseminated by the msm, called upon as an &#8216;expert&rsquo; as what is to be done viz. race relations.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s statement is patently false  &mdash;  but fits perfectly with the vision of &#8216;utopia&rsquo; that the hostile elites who control the msm, academia and government wish to force on WHITES while hypocritically holding themselves and their loved ones apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Segregation can appear to allay social tensions, but it worsens them in the long run. Optimal democracies require more than voting; they require social integration and involvement&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a harsh powerful central government can impose and maintain social integration through tyranny, as the old Soviets did in the Balkans. White involvement will never be allowed.  There is not a place on earth, anywhere in time, where such a peaceful utopia exits or existed  &mdash;  and the hostile elites know it.</p>
<p>Their goal is not utopia but rather a liberty-stripping, authoritarian, oppressive-style government wielding Soviet, police-state tactics.  And this is being implemented here  &mdash;  hate speech laws to stifle any form of dissent, the importation of Third World peoples to replace Whites and create a massive welfare state, so-called &#8216;anti-discrimination&rsquo; laws used to force Section 8 housing into formerly White areas,  witless blacks employed as battering rams against Whites via AA laws that deny Whites careers and promotions, government take over of businesses, satanic taxes to strip Whites of any remaining wealth and a planned destruction of the American dollar and economy.</p>
<p>So it does appear that we are right on track for what the government, academia and the msm have planned for us  &mdash;   recreating the miserable conditions in the Balkans.  We are on the road to  Third World economic poverty and chaos with plenty of ethnic and/or racial warfare.  All of this will be held barely in check by a government that will sit on us like a lid on a pressure cooker.  </p>
<p>This is the same utopia the Soviets promised and the US government is mandating for us. </p>

I grew up in an all white town next to an all black one. We could leave our doors unlocked at night. The black township next door had third world murder and robbery rates.

		<p>What bothers blacks like Rich Benjamin about &ldquo;whitopias&rdquo;  is that white people can live amongst each other, thrive, keep a low crime rate, a good economy and good schools.</p>
<p>Blacks are incapable of that,  and it drives people like Benjamin and other black interlopers crazy!  They are insanely jealous! <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right!   This is  <b>why blacks are the biggest proponents of &ldquo;racially diverse communities&rdquo; </b><br>
.          __  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully agree.  Not really.  Not quite.  </p>
<p>Yes,  blacks are jealous. And undeniably, blacks do prefer the benefits of  &#8220;diverse communities&#8221; (ie. living among whites or as close as possible),  but they are NOT the <i>&#8220;biggest proponents&#8221;  </i>of &#8220;Diversity&#8221;.  They never have been!   Nor did they even invent the concept.  On their own, the notion wouldn&rsquo;t exist.   You don&rsquo;t see blacks in Africa or Brazil clamoring for Diversity!  They don&rsquo;t demand that whites come in and &#8220;diversify&#8221; their communities. To the contrary, they want to drive out whatever whites are there.</p>
<p>It is only white neighborhoods, and now entire white countries, that are being subjected to Diversity.   It is a one-way street.   Check out Prof. Ignatief and his movement to &#8220;abolish the white race&#8221; (yes, I&rsquo;m not kidding).  There is no similar movement to &#8220;abolish&#8221; the black race.  No one says the black race is  &#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;. </p>
<p>When you look more deeply into such things as Marxist rhetoric and the very sinister  anti-white Frankfurt School, you find that the fundamental ideology lying behind all of this  DOES NOT COME FROM BLACKS.  These deep philosophical underpinnings of present-day movements have been germinating for generations, and we are seeing the fruits today.  But they are beyond the grasp of  most so-called &#8220;blacks&#8221;   &mdash;   except for a rare high-octroon like W.E.B. duBois.  Blacks  are being steered and told what they should have,  what is good for them and what they need.   What they are entitled to, and what whites &#8220;owe&#8221; them. Like everything else, it is all being done <b><i>for them </i></b> &hellip; by others.  </p>
<p>No, blacks are not the <b><i>biggest </i></b>proponents of Diversity.</p>

 &ldquo;So where did these blacks get the kind of money needed to rent a $400,000 house. Nobody knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some very wealthy person obviously wants that area of real estate and the only way to get it is to finance blacks to move in, lower the property values and then snatch it up at fire sale prices. Cut the money off then the blacks move away.<br>
   <br>
__   __   __   __   __</p>
<p>Some very wealthy person?  Yes.  But those very wealthy people  won&rsquo;t go away.  That&rsquo;s the real source of the trouble. And so there&rsquo;ll just  be more of the same trouble in the future.</p>
<p>While whites (as here on Amren) continually cry about their deteriorating neighborhoods and the loss of property values  (to them),  there is always someone in the background who is profiting    &mdash;     profiting in either some way or another.  Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t be happening.  And bear in mind that  not all &#8220;profit&#8221; is  necessarily financial.  (e.g. Does George Soros look exclusively for financial gain from his ventures, or are there other motives to serve?)    </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting more and more expensive to live among whites.   As prices rise and neighborhoods are invaded, what has always been taken for granted  (living among one&rsquo;s own kind)  is becoming, for whites,  more and more a luxury that only  the well-to-do can afford.  Affirmative action will increase that, putting money and good jobs into the hands of non-whites and withholding them from whites.   For most whites, the option to live among their own is constantly narrowing down as  we are being priced out of our own neighborhoods.   Eventually, it will be an option available only to the wealthy.  That is, unless you want to live in the outer-outer-outskirts and  commute 2 or 3  hours each way to work (assuming you still have a decent job to go to).</p>
<p>Every time property changes hands, someone profits.  Stagnant property doesn&rsquo;t generate profits for middlemen;  the more turn-over, the better.  Who profits when you are forced to sell your home at a disastrous loss and then move farther out to a new house, in a new development, that costs you far more?  Who builds/owns/finances the housing tracts and the shopping malls in that new area? Do some homework.</p>
<p>Wealth doesn&rsquo;t just vanish;  it is transferred from out of one pocket into another.  While one party loses, another gains.   Not everyone goes away crying!   Pull back the curtain and learn who is causing this.  Who profits?  Who, for instance, is promoting these laws that force whites to rent to blacks, or programs  that force school busing upon white neighborhoods?   Who are the judges, lawyers, politicians who make these decisions?  Who are the organizations that finance them and back them?   Cui bono?</p>

<p>A real load of manure, coming from a liberal.  Liberals have spent the last hundred years trying to achieve the kind of atomized, decultured society that embraces the state.  When people have families, churches, and real communities, they make their own way and don&rsquo;t need government.  When &#8220;families&#8221; are a single mother and her children, churches are empty, and communities a babbling polyglot, people embrace the State as mommy and daddy.</p>
<p>Maybe Benjamin should&rsquo;ve read the fine print on the contract better; then he might know what that deal with the Devil really entailed.  Liberal democracy is not a recipe for an involved civic life, it&rsquo;s a recipe for socialism.</p>

		<p>Through out the internet you will find countless blacks taunting whites, that they are on the verge of extinction, and smugly reminding them that their numbers are steadily dwindling. </p>
<p>While this is a satisfying thought for many of them, one wonders how they delude themselves into believing this will somehow be a boon for them, or that somehow this will bring them more power. </p>
<p>It is true that in the US the non-white population is growing daily, but in reality, it is not blacks who are the fastest growing minority, but Hispanics. Do they actually, believe they will be welcomed as brothers and sisters among them, when even today, there are constant turf battles going on between them, in many American cities? </p>
<p>Without whites, there would no longer be nice safe, peaceful and prosperous communities for them to flock to in droves, and welfare, or section 8, since the country would surely take an economic hit, far worse than we are seeing today, and perhaps even worse than during the great depression, without the backbone of the white middle class in place to support them on their tax dollars.</p>
<p>Far too many of them live in a fairytale world, filled with delusions of grandeur. A perfect example would be Zimbabwe, black Zimbabweans were convinced that once black gained the majority, and ran the country, they would prosper. Yet here they are today scrambling for the last few remaining white farms they can get their hands on. Why? Because they are incapable of growing their own food! Which in reality shows just how very dependent they are upon whites for their very survival. </p>
<p>We also saw the same thing in major cities like Detroit. They wanted a part of the power structure there, but after effectively chasing off the whites, the city collapsed into economic despair. They can&rsquo;t blame it all on the auto industry, when whites who fled to the suburbs, still managed to regroup, and later thrive independently. Now they are trying to horn their way in there as well, or are flocking to once mostly white suburbs in the South. </p>
<p>For all their hatred of whites, they know in their hearts, they can&rsquo;t go it alone without them, never could, and never will. </p>

<p>Virtually all chocolate cities suffer the same blight to varying degrees, and virtually all of them started off as prosperous white cities, until blacks slowly moved in, and turned them to ruins.

		<p>For those who think that returning to the way things were in the &#8220;old days&#8221; when whites dominated and Christianity brought peace and order, I recommend the Zane Grey book, &#8220;The New Riders of the Purple Sage.&#8221;  The probability is that the same types of things would emerge if we were segregated from all others and threw out the idea and prinicipals of a secular governing style.  Because even when we were, and we were pretty much in control, religious zealots of all types popped up and made life difficult for everyone else.  That is why a huge rethink of the presiding notions of an exclusive, conservative and white nation.  </p>
<p>As I have pointed out before, such a nation would have to be very intra-cooperative because it would likely be banned from world trade and pressured, if not militarily invaded by bordering nations.  It looks to me like we are stuck in this nation, so we need a set of more subtle solutions than the aspiration of a national Whitopia, because it isn&rsquo;t likely to happen.</p>
<p>PS, This nation has been Balkanized since we first set up the Reservation system.  Any chance for one or two White Reservations?  Ans; Not likely.  Also, our interstate rivalries almost amount to petty Balkanization at times.</p>

<p><br>
Ridiculous! Name any white former community that actually improved once blacks started to gain a significant foothold in population? I have actually seen blacks blame the changes that happen on these communities on white-flight, as though, they are somehow morally obligated to stay in a community with a growing crime rate. Whites wish to live in mostly white communities, for the same reason black do not wish to move into them! This man is calling majority white neighborhoods Whiteopias. He is basically admitting that all white communities are seen as utopias, because such communities tend to be cleaner, safer, and are places which families can thrive in. It is no coincidence, that the top 10 most dangerous cities in America, all happen to have a black majority, so to who&rsquo;s betterment is it to break up these *whiteopias*? He wants to legislate where whites can live, and safely raise their children, which is despicable. It&rsquo;s interesting how many blacks often complain that cities like Compton, are shifting from being black majority to, Hispanic majority, where is that love of diversity, they talk about so much? Oh that&rsquo;s right, they only wish to enforce this way of life on whites.</p>

		<p>Would he refer to a Chinatown district as a Chinatopia? Or a Hispanic community as a Hispanitopia? And would he be insisting they need to embrace more blacks in the name of diversity? Somehow I doubt it. Blacks only seem interested in nudging their way into white neighborhoods, making sure they add plenty of chocolate flavor to those bland vanilla outposts, they nonetheless find so impossible to resist. What few of them realize, is that they would be no less welcome in an Asian community or an Arab or Indian enclave, much less a Hispanic one. Their reputations for destroying communities is legendary worldwide, and welcomed nowhere.</p>

		<p>Idealists and dreamers are certainly entitled their delusions, especially when they remain a safe distance from where the tire actually hits the road. Nature however often has a mind of its own,.. such as &#8220;birds of a feather&#8221; or &#8220;blood is thicker than water&#8221;. The integration that these idealists are desiring is at a genetic level like Brazil for instance or Mexico to some degree where essentially the white gene pool is absorbed by the darker races only leaving traces of its former existence. this underlying antagonism is why Jefferson is quoted as saying &#8221; As long as America tries to integrate black with white there shall be social rifts forever&#8221; and whether or not he had illicite affairs with a black woman is immaterial in the same way that a person that wishes they never began to smoke is not necessarily a hypocrite in warning their kids not to start.</p>

<p>And what would be reasonable rhetoric on race? Let me guess, the usual song and dance routine, that Diversity is our strength? I can tell you might white grandparents gained nothing when blacks increasingly began to overtake their neighborhood in Detroit, and they were forced to sell the beautifully designed home they raised 4 kids in, and were once so happy in they thought they would never leave. That particular section of town, can no longer even qualify as a neighborhood, their old house was gutted years ago, like so many on that block, thanks to looters and devil&rsquo;s night pyromaniacs. When I look at the old black and white pictures of how good life seemed in Detroit back then, and think what diversity did to it, I know diversity actually destroys, not enriches.

<p>Who does he honestly think he is fooling? Home prices are hardly cheaper in a nice white community, than in a crumbling black inner city ghetto. The only reason most black families are able to afford to live in these whiteopias is usually thanks to section 8 housing, and that is at the tax payers expense, as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whites in this country are being displaced by non-Whites, which increasingly are foreigners or their offspring. We, the descendants of the people who built this country and the ones who continue to sustain it, do not like to be chased out of the cities we built.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the same could be said with respect to Anglo-Saxons and European ethnics.</p>
<p>FYI, the people who actually &#8216;built&rsquo; the US haven&rsquo;t been in charge for a LONG time, a lot longer than I think you realize, in fact. Even in the early part of the 20th century, WASP influence was already on the wane, with prominent individuals in high places mostly just acting as a &#8216;mask&rsquo; to distract people from realizing that they were being displaced by dissimilar types (i.e. Italians, Irish, Hungarians, etc.). The issue has NEVER been about &#8216;white&rsquo; people, but about specific types (i.e. legitimate ethnocultural groups).</p>

However, near the end of the segment the interviewer &#8220;slipped&#8221; and mentioned that the houses in the predominantly black  subdivision were about 20% CHEAPER than equivalent houses in an all-white subdivision.<br>
