			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, October 13, Congressman Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) released the &#8220;core principles&#8221; of the amnesty bill he is planning to introduce in Congress later this year. The bill will be similar to other pieces of amnesty legislation from previous sessions of Congress, including (1) several different amnesty programs aimed at legalizing the 12 million illegal aliens currently living in the United States and (2) empty promises of enforcement. (Rep. Gutierrez Press Release, October 13, 2009).</p>
<p>The three amnesty programs included in Rep. Gutierrez&rsquo;s proposal are:</p>
<p>* An amnesty for illegal alien &#8220;workers.&#8221; In Gutierrez&rsquo; own words: &#8220;We need a bill that says if you come here to hurt our communities, we will not support you. But if you are here to work hard  &mdash;  if you are here to make a better life for your family  &mdash;  you will have the opportunity to earn your citizenship.&#8221; (Gutierrez Press Release).</p>
<p>* The AgJOBS amnesty. (Id.). This legislation would grant amnesty to millions of illegal alien agricultural workers and &#8220;reform&#8221; the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program to allow employers easier access to cheap foreign labor. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Analysis of AgJOBS, June 17, 2009).</p>
<p>* The DREAM Act amnesty. (Gutierrez Press Release). The DREAM Act (1) grants amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the country as children and have met certain minimal educational requirements and (2) reverses current federal law to allow states to provide taxpayer-subsidized in-state tuition to illegal aliens. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Analysis of the DREAM Act, March 2009).</p>
<p>According to a new poll from Zogby International, passage of these amnesty provisions would likely result in increased illegal immigration. The Zogby poll found that 56 percent of Mexican citizens believe that granting amnesty to illegal aliens in the United States would make it more likely that people they know would go to the United States illegally. Only 17 percent thought it would make Mexicans less likely to go illegally, with the remaining 27 percent either saying that they were unsure or that an amnesty would make no difference. (Zogby, October 2009). With respect to the passage of amnesty in the United States, the opinions of Mexican citizens are important: according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), nearly 60 percent of the illegal aliens living in the United States in January 2008 were from Mexico. (DHS: Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2008, February 2009).</p>
<p>The Gutierrez bill will also provide for increases in legal immigration, according to a press release from the pro-amnesty &#8220;Reform Immigration for America&#8221; coalition. According to the release, the forthcoming legislation will &#8220;[a]llocate sufficient visas to close unlawful migration channels.&#8221; (Reform Immigration for America Press Release). However, a recent report released by The New York Times indicates that this provision in the Gutierrez bill would actually open additional channels of unlawful migration. According to The Times, &#8220;the United States still has no reliable system for verifying that foreign visitors have left the country.&#8221; In fact, federal officials estimate that &#8220;40 percent of the&hellip;illegal immigrants in the United States came on legal visas and overstayed.&#8221; (The New York Times, October 11, 2009). Accordingly, Congressman Gutierrez&rsquo; plan to increase legal immigration by allocating more visas would actually exacerbate the problem of illegal immigration in the United States.</p>
<p>Rep. Gutierrez has yet to release actual legislative language. However, Gutierrez did state last week that he is planning to introduce his bill &#8220;sometime right after Thanksgiving.&#8221; (Congress Daily, October 14, 2009).</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t need immigration reform, we need immigration control. Illegals are illegal period, no amnesty for lawbreakers. As far as agricultural labor, they can do legal temporary contract/seasonal work, where they stay for a period of time, pick crops and then must go home and it is strictly enforced. As far as legal immigration, it should be mostly halted, except for mitigating circumstances as we are in a recession and we&rsquo;ve already had so much. The bottom line it the American people want illegal immigration halted and illegals back in their home country and they want legal immigration severly reduced. It is the will of the people,  that should be carried out, not those that want cheap labor or Hispanic special interests groups or illegals themselves.</p>

		<p>Another euphamistic fantasy regarding the Hispnaic tidal wave - the preposterous idea that every last one of these invaders is a &#8220;worker&#8221; ala &#8220;Undocumented Workers&#8221; etc. What about the wives of those &#8220;workers?&#8221; What about their many children? Their elderly relatives? What about those who just don&rsquo;t work at all, or not with any regularity? </p>
<p>How is anyone stupid enough to buy into this nonsense?! My God, we must surely be the most gullible generations of mankind ever to have walked the earth!</p>

The very presence of Mexicans in the Unites States hurts the White community.  They all must go.  Just because Pedro cuts hangs out at the Home Depot and hasn&rsquo;t raped any little boys yet doesn&rsquo;t mean that his welfare receiving, soon to be gang and La Raza members, bastard children have earned the right to be Americans.  </p>

		<p>Here we go again.   Bring it on Rep. Gutierrez.  The citizens of the US say He!! No to illegal immigration and amnesty of persons (from wherever) who are here illegally.  The citizens say no to increases in legal immigration from third world countries and &lsquo;extended family&rsquo; as a means of selecting immigrants. Reduce legal immigration by a factor of 4, at least.<br>
We beat this nonsense when McCain-Kennedy brought it down the pike and we will defeat it again with grassroots movements.  It is a shame these immigration activists keep pushing these bills and requiring busy people to react and block them. I am anxious to do whatever necessary to keep the USA a majority white country.  Making the Duggar family a national ideal for family life would be a good start! <br>

		<p>Excerpts of an analysis: </p>
<p>If they wanted to race replace us so badly, why couldn&rsquo;t they at least have used other Caucasians (i.e. Arabs, North Africans, Northwest East Indians, etc.), instead of using people of different sub-species who happen to be almost as distant as possible-Brown Hispanics (tropical AmerIndians) and Brown Southeast Asians (Tropical Mongoloids). I don&rsquo;t want race-replacement, but an Iranian* or even a Saudi Arabian is better than nearly pure-blooded Central and South Americans!&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&ldquo;Accordingly, Congressman Gutierrez&rsquo; plan to increase legal immigration by allocating more visas would actually exacerbate the problem of illegal immigration in the United States.&rdquo; [from Original article]</p>
<p>Of course! Because, Mr. Guitterrez is Brown Hispanic First! His race comes even before the survival of his counrty. When will these mega-naive Whites get it?! Hispanics are not fighting genuine &ldquo;oppression.&rdquo; They are just practicing racial politics, doing the best they can to displace Caucasians.</p>
<p>They are Tropical America-Mongoloid race fighting a subspecies war against us, not just in the US-but even in Europe. The Hispanics are shamelessly Hispanic first and foremost!<br>
When will the mega-naive Whites get it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Gutierrez did state last week that he is planning to introduce his bill &rsquo;sometime right after Thanksgiving.&rsquo;&rdquo; [from Original article]</p>
<p>Of course, when Americans are least likely to pay attention!</p>
<p>Hey, mega-naive Whites! Do you still believe it&rsquo;s about Democratic principles first? Do you still believe the Hispanic politicians really care about being fair and representing the people first? Do you honestly still believe they don&rsquo;t think race and subspecies matter?</p>
<p>Open your eyes, uncover your ears, and observe what&rsquo;s going on!&#8221;</p>

		<p>This man is a traitor to this country! He no more represents the US than Reid, Pelosi and the rest of their ilk. Gutierrez is very open about his desire to fill this country with the impoverished, uneducated masses that sneak across out borders daily. When will the people of his district wake up to who this person really represents? He works long and hard&hellip;for Mexico. Get him out of office ASAP! Look at areas around this once beautiful country and see the sickening mess they&rsquo;re turned into. Garbage lines the street and walls of buildings are destroyed by graffiti. These people bring their third worlds with them. If you want a decent country for you children and grandchilden, get rid of the illegal alien supporters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;millions of agricultural workers&#8221;? Where? The growers and farmers are constantly whining they can&rsquo;t get cheap labor. Guess the illegal immigrants are looking for easier pickin&rsquo;s than stoop labor work. I see that by far, the most illegals work in construction, in food service and restaurant occupations, in hotel housekeeping, and of course W-M, Target, Home Depot and the other large chains.</p>
<p>We need to make it perfectly clear. AMNESTY in any form, by whatever name, will cause the death of the Democratic Party. Let YOUR congressmen and senators hear how YOU feel about amnesty for criminal illegal aliens.</p>
<p>&rsquo;s funny how Luis Gutierrez managed to &#8220;forget&#8221; the vast amount of real crimes perpetrated by illegals after they get here. Virtually every news article locally, that shows a name or pix of the perp, reminds us of just how bad crime by Mexican illegals really is.</p>

		<p>Luis Guitterez was a former taxi cab driver promoted by Chicago Mayor Harold Washington to an aldermanic position on the City Council. While in local office, Guitterez supported Washington&rsquo;s executive order which directed the Chicago Police Department not to cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in terms of sharing information concerning illegal aliens in police custody. The INS would have to conduct its own investigations. </p>
<p>Following Washington&rsquo;s death, Guitterez succeeded in a Congressional bid by running in a heavily gerrymandered district that was drawn to elect a Latino. He has been returned to office every two years since then. He frequently behaves as if he represents Puerto Rico rather than Chicago in Congress.  </p>
<p>All Americans are paying a heavy price for Harold Washington&rsquo;s miscalculation. </p>

		<p>Gutierrez and others favoring amnesty want to change immigration decisions radically.  The emphasis would no longer be on the preservation of American society and the consent of the governed but would allow aliens themselves to decide who comes to America.  We already have family reunification which allows chain migration and allows poorer, less educated, and the less skilled then those who  preceded them. This is a pattern that continues today.  NO society can withstand the unconditional mass of migration, The preservation of the nation&rsquo;s sovereignty, and the culture, language,  mores, traditions and customs dictate that citizenship be granted only by the consent  of the governed, not as Gutierrez would have it, by the unilateral actions or demands of the alien who wants to be legal and  still wants to pledge his allegiance to his native country.  </p>

		<p>You have to respect Gutierrez for one thing, at least (I refuse to provide the honorific of &#8220;Congressman&#8221; to slimeballs like him). This man makes no pretenses about why he was elected, and who he was elected to serve to the exclusion of all others: that would be amnesty and Hispanics (whether legal or illegal), respectively. Unfortunately, it seems the only people in Congress who serve those who elected them are blacks and Hispanics. Tribalism in action.</p>
<p>I think that the voting actions of Gutierrez offer a glimpse into the future of the United States, unless we stop the Hispanic invasion. We will have outright tribalism as per Gutierrez, but people like Gutierrez will also use the might of the state to ensure whites can not act similarly. This already happens to a large degree, so imagine how bad it will be when we have a hundred or two Gutierrezs and we are a near-Hispanic majority country.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary virtue of whites, their industriousness and civility, will be harnessed to ensure their downfall in their own nations. Sometimes I wonder if we don&rsquo;t deserve it for being so weak. It&rsquo;s an offense against the basic law of nature, which is to put yourself and your own kind first.</p>

		<p>TEDDY ROOSEVELT 1907<br>
Theodore Roosevelt on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN</p>
<p><br>
  &#8220;In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man&rsquo;s becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American&hellip;There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn&rsquo;t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile&hellip;We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language&hellip;and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.&#8221; </p>
