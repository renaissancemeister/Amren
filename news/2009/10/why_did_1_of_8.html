<h1>Why Did 1 of 8 Girls Get Pregnant at Robeson High?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristyn Hartman, KCAL-TV (Chicago), October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is a Chicago public school full of energy and spirit. It has about 800 girls, and 115 of them have something in common  &mdash;  something you might find disturbing.</p>
<p>All those young ladies are moms or moms-to-be at Paul Robeson High School. It&rsquo;s not a school for young mothers, it&rsquo;s a neighborhood school. And all of the pregnancies have happened, despite prevention talk.</p>
<p>If you want to know why, the people closest to the situation say there&rsquo;s no simple explanation.</p>
<p>Chicago Public Schools says it does not track the overall number of teen moms in the district. But Robeson Principal Gerald Morrow knows the count at his school in Englewood: 115 young ladies who are either expecting or already have had children.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, their school pictures would fill roughly six pages of their high school year book.</p>
<p>Why is it happening at Robeson?</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be a lot of things that are happening in the home or not happening in the home, if you will,&#8221; Morrow said. Absentee fathers are another factor, he said.</p>
<p>LaDonna Denson and two other Robeson students say parents not talking to teens and, in some cases, the pursuit of public assistance also factor into the pregnancies. None of them thought they&rsquo;d be moms at such a young age.</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me at all. As a middle school student I saw plenty of black girls who showed up at school pregnant. But this was back in the early 1970s when integration just began. I guess this was how diversity was supposed to enrich us.</p>

<p>I bet it does and probably they think it&rsquo;s their natural right. The probability is high that taxpayers will pay for their kid&rsquo;s upbringing and then pay again later for many of their incarcerations (not to mention crime costs). Maybe we need a law that precludes any girl from receiving welfare benefits under the age of 18 just for getting pregnant.</p>

		<p> Once again a media story&rsquo;s tap dance around the issue of race would have made Fred Astaire envious.</p>
<p> How can a story about school pregnancies, in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; American city, NOT mention race? When it makes blacks look bad, that&rsquo;s when. If there were ever, in a civilized country, a collective group of parents worse at raising their children than blacks are in the U.S.A., in the 21st Century, I can&rsquo;t imagine who it would be. And judging by statistics on the natives and current residents of Sub-Saharan Africa, it&rsquo;s no better there.</p>
<p> But the article carefully avoids any mention of race   &mdash;   not that they&rsquo;re fooling anyone. &#8220;Absentee fathers,&#8221; &#8220;the pursuit of public assistance,&#8221; a principal whose mother had him at 15   &mdash;   you don&rsquo;t have to be a Mensa member to read between THOSE lines.  </p>

<p>My God - is the author of this article really <i> that </i> stupid?</p>
<p>Of course there is a simple explanation for the mass illegitimacy rates at this particular school  &mdash;  so simple, in fact, that even someone who possessed only half a brain in their skull could figure it out: the school is 99% black.</p>

<p>Ah, typical liberal stupidity. Blame the parents. Blame society. Blame the government. Just don&rsquo;t blame it on blacks themselves.</p>

		<p>This seems to be a whole new media direction of recent years - completely ignore the racial angle, even when essentially EVRYONE involved is black, and race obviously plays a cenral role to the whole narrative. Presumably, the intent is to make it appear as though this could be &#8220;anytown USA&#8221; or, could be any group of people, white, asian, etc. And they write the article in such a manner that for the unenlightened, the race angle won&rsquo;t be immediately revealed, if at all. The race-deniers are clever, you must give them that - completely wrong and unspeakably dangerous&hellip;but clever. </p>

		<p>It is ironic that this school is the namesake of Paul Robeson, one of the most famous black Americans of his day.  Robeson grew up in a middle class family that valued success and education.  He was one of the first African Americans to attend and graduate from Rutgers University in the post-war era.  He went on to obtain a law degree from Columbia University, where his radicalism began.  He tried professional football, acting, and law, but he became a celebrity as a gifted singer and entertainer, enjoying huge success in Europe.  He drifted into socialism, unionism, and ultimately communism, actually receiving an award in Moscow from the dictator Stalin himself. He played the victim role as a blackballed minority persecuted by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and never regained his fame in this country after a period of involuntary exile in France and England.  Recently opened files have revealed Robeson was indeed an actual communist &#8220;spy&#8221; with Soviet handlers forcing him to rat on some of his &#8220;friends&#8221; and fellow entertainers. One of his Russian Jewish friends on his informant list died violently in ambiguous circumstances. Robeson was a fluent Russian speaker. His later life was marked by chronic illness and obscurity.  Robeson wrote an autobiography that turned out to contain more than a few lies, exaggerations, and omissions, but most historians won&rsquo;t touch this black icon with a ten foot pole, unless they ignore many distasteful facts about him. He is the only known American communist who has appeared on his own US postage stamp. Dozens of schools, parks, and roads are named after him. </p>
<p>The irony in this matter pertains to his personal and sexual life.  Although married, Robeson was a sexual libertine constantly on the lookout for a conquest. His wife simply learned to live with the knowledge that he slept with hundreds (thousands?) of women on three continents while she tended their home in New York or Philadelphia.  It is not known how many progeny he produced, but the number is thought to be huge, with many of these illegitimate kids named after him.  He suffered from mental illness, clinical depression and possibly bipolar disorder, at the end of his life and died in 1976.</p>
<p>Robeson High School is aptly named.  Somebody add up all the pregnant girls (or mothers) who dropped out of this school during their teens and are therefore unaccounted for. This would no doubt send the figures over the 1,000 mark.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet it was higher than that.</p>
<p>Having come from a public highschool that was largely black, I&rsquo;m willing to wager that around 1/4 to 1/6 of black females were either pregnant or already had kids. This is a figure that can&rsquo;t be exaggerated; you have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>No amount of sex or contraceptive education ever does the black community any good - blacks will be blacks will be blacks. The hive reproductive mentality is at full-throttle, much to the chagrin of the white community.</p>
<p>It amazes me that this is still even a news story - unprotected sex among blacks is as natural as civility among whites. You&rsquo;re not going to change it. </p>
<p>Not to change the subject, but AIDS used to be known as a homosexual disease. White gays learned to use condoms, yet AIDS continues to be among the main killers of blacks. </p>
<p>Gee, I wonder why.</p>

		<p>None of this is surprising, really. Robeson H.S., like Fenger, is an inner-city educational dump. What&rsquo;s amusing to me, is that girls have unprotected sex, and then bleat how they never thought they could get pregnant.</p>

<p>She reports that 115 of nine hundred high school students (in this effusively praised school) are pregnant but neglects to mention that the school is 99% black. I wonder what the hapless other one percent are.</p>
<p>She then goes on to pretend to be puzzled by the ubiquitous &#8220;root causes&#8221; of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the percentage of pregnancies in this school is not all that atypical of black female high school students throughout urban America.</p>

		<p>I live near Chicago.  The report I saw on the local news said there were now plans to build a day-care center across from the school to accomodate these baby-mommas. Chicago is a finacial disaster already having the highest sales tax in the country.  Business are fleeing and every day the county or city come up with some new tax or fee.  The problem here, like everywhere in this country, is there are no consequences for irresponsible behavior on those who act irresponsibly.  The burden of their actions is bourn by the responsible, productive people.  A few weeks ago, a mob of Black kids beat a kid to death right out in front of school.  The response; Jessie Jackson gave a speech and the school got a few hundred thousand tax dollars to build a basketball court or some other after school plaything.</p>

		<p>If Robeson is anything like the minority-dominated school at which I once TRIED to teach, there will be special classes for these lovely and talented &#8220;moms to be&#8221; that&rsquo;ll get them to come to school, be counted as part of the average daily enrollment, and get the school all sorts of state and federal (that is, taxpayer&rsquo;s) funds.  </p>
<p>These pregnant females will spend the majority of their day (usually only three hours) in these holding tanks where they&rsquo;ll pick out wondrous first names for their progeny, catch up on the latest gossip, and then go back to the neighborhood to do the same thing over and over, ad infinitum.</p>

		<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t understand the Right&rsquo;s vehement opposition to abortion.  I really do understand the theologically based argument against it, but come on- this is the reality.  We are growing this huge, seething, violent underclass at a rapid pace.  In this environment, life becomes less sacred- in fact, life becomes cheap, indeed.</p>
<p>I know that the argument is that people should just have the morals and intelligence to not have all these unplanned pregnancies in the first place.  Well, that isn&rsquo;t going to happen.  I&rsquo;ve worked at an all black school full of pregnant girls that don&rsquo;t even really believe you if you tell them how they got pregnant in the first place.  So sex education, while pretty important, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much effect on them.  They just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>No amount of &#8220;abstinence education&#8221; is going to have an effect on these people.  They cannot and will not control their reproduction.  No, whites cannot outbreed them.  We are intelligent, and we seek to bring our young into a nurturing environment.  This is generally a good thing.  You can blame &#8220;feminism&#8221; all you want, but the truth is, most intelligent creatures will drastically slow reproduction in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>We are going to to have to seriously look at what can be done to slow down the reproductive rates of low IQ people.  I can see this coming down to some legislation that many will find distasteful.  I can also see religious types getting in the way of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re well beyond the tipping point.  Something has to give, and soon.</p>

		<p>This evidence suggests these youths lack a form of intelligence called abstract reasoning. The idea of a birth 9 months away is just too far removed for them to take action and use birth control. They just tend to live in the moment and this also explains why blacks have an AIDS rate ten times that of whites. The disease is just too far removed from the behavior that causes it to allow them to modify their behavior and take precautions. People who lack abstract reasoning abilities live in the moment, their future does not even enter the equation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not ironic. It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>
<p>Blacks everywhere insist that schools, parks, streets, stadium, public buildings, community centers and more be named after blacks because, they tell us, young black kids will be inspired to achieve greatness.</p>
<p>IT NEVER WORKED AND NEVER WILL!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing this LIE.</p>
<p>Right now, here in Buffalo, a new courthouse is going up. Blacks want it named after a black woman who worked in a homeless food kitchen. Mind you, she didn&rsquo;t start the place, she just worked there.</p>
<p>Why? Because it will be an inspiration to the black community of Buffalo.</p>

		<p>The truth is even uglier than the stats. If you extrapolate the entire 4 years, it works out to about 2 in 5 before drop out day. This is a law enforcement problem pure and simple. The average age of the male is 25 not 15. They wait after school in their Navigators to pick them up. They believe you can`t get aids from a 15 year old girl. In Florida we have a law that if you are over 24 and she is under 18 it is a quasi rape and you can get 15 years.If Illinois starting cracking down on these predators the rate would go down. We have allowed lower class blacks to live in an open sewer. As long as the strongest of them only prey on weaker blacks we turn our eyes away glad they don`t come after us. They don`t need welfare, medical care, or any kind of care. They need order and they need it in spades.<br>

		<p>Dear Dave # 33.  You propose that Blacks fail because of racism, poverty and lack of opportunity.  That has been the working hypothesis for the last 50 years.  During that time, the USA has spent probably close to a Trillion Dollars on &#8220;lifting up&#8221; Africans.  We have attempted tens of thousands of different programs and schemes.  We have turned our entire society inside out to accommodate Minorities.  At my university, there is not a meeting or a day that goes by without discussing, lamenting, planning, and implementing some new Minority-Program. It would take me 5 pages to list all of the Minority-directed programs in my town.  At my university and in my town, the opportunities for People of Color are endless.  Yet, after 50 years, there is very little change in African success.  </p>
<p>It is time that we examined alternative explanations for why Africans fail throughout the World, and N.E. Asians and Jews succeed where ever they go. Wherever on this planet Africans congregate, they fail, because of their low genetic IQ.</p>
<p>Basing cures on the wrong causes leads to failure.  It is time that we admitted that there are genetic differences between the races, and structure our programs around that.  Telling Blacks that they fail because of racism is a lie that can only lead to anger and frustration among Blacks, and racial conflict.  <br>

<p>&gt; Apparently Dave, you are unaware of the at least last four decades of overcompensating reversal of the alleged decades of prejudice, oppression, etc., that you so righteously list.  Billions of dollars have been spent creating do nothing jobs in government bureacracies, education, and special programs, along with a decided repression of whites, especially white males.  The above story is just one of the high number of poor results this investment and &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; that has been made.  And if you would just review non-PC skewed research, you would realize it.  But all you need do is look around and believe your eyes.</p>
<p>If a growing number of whites are beginning to openly resent the destruction of our society and country by the sort of culture blacks have generated - (whites did not create rap and hip-hop, you know), you would realize what a ridiculous, DUPE you are as a typical self-hating white man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the choice, the situation at this point is such that a white living anywhere in the world has to hate himself in order to go on supporting these sort of ongoing social and monetary sacrifices.<br>

		<p>Hey &#8220;Dave&#8221;, most of the folks whose postings appear on here went to school at the most prestigious school in America.  Yep, they graduated from &#8220;Hard Knocks&#8221; where they saw the destruction of civilized neighborhoods, the innundation and overwhelming of once-terrific schools, and the waste of their hard-earned dollars.</p>
<p>All of the above was in the name of, first, integration, and then the goddess of diversity.  NONE of it has worked.</p>
<p>What these people have experienced IS empirically driven information.  Have a look at (in no special order) Detroit, Gary, East St. Louis, Birmingham, north Milwaukee, trenton, and St. Louis.  All of these communities were places where hard-working Americans bought homes, saved for their kids&rsquo; educations, maintained their assets and then saw it all washed out in a sea of govermental regulation and anti-White racism.</p>
<p>Many of these good people gave the platitudes of the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s a decent chance to succeed only to find out that what their parents and grandparents had warned them about was indeed true.  I count myself as one among these contributors.</p>
<p>You come off as a snot-nosed youngster who hasn&rsquo;t experienced the real scene that America has become.  I&rsquo;m sorry for you because in the long run you, too, will learn.  Hopefully it won&rsquo;t be the hard way.</p>
<p>Before you post on here again, walk a mile in the shoes of the AmRen posters. </p>

		<p>In response to Dave, poster #33.</p>
<p>I suspect that you&rsquo;re not really a liberal; that you&rsquo;re bored and have nothing better to do than inflame others on this website with poorly thought-out arguements that even rudimentary knowledge proves false.</p>
<p>But incase you really are a genuine liberal who actually believes in the nonsensical arguements that you just put forth, I&rsquo;ll reply.</p>
<p>My dad grew up in poverty. He lived in a single-parent home with his father, a construction worker who barely made enough to house and feed everyone, and three siblings. When I was growing up, my dad always made me appreciate things that would normally be taken for granted because he couldn&rsquo;t afford those things growing up. Unable to pay for college, he joined the Army for 6 years and served 2 tours in Vietnam so that he could pay for his college. And despite growing up poor, in the end he managed to become very successful.</p>
<p>My dad NEVER resorted to dealing drugs, shoplifting, motor vehical theft, having careless sex and bastardizing children, joining a gang or any other sociopathic and criminal behavior commonly found in blacks  &mdash;  despite his growing up poor.</p>
<p>There are <i> many </i> white Americans who are poor, but they don&rsquo;t behave like criminals on a large scale. Only blacks seem to, regardless of socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Oh, and another point:</p>
<p>Compared to modern life, people in the year 1000 had it very tough. By our standards, virtually all of them were dirt poor. The typical &#8220;impoverished&#8221; black American of today has it much better than the average person who lived in the year 1000. Just look at those overweight and obese &#8220;impoverished&#8221; African American women, who are overfed, to the average person in the year 1000, who stuggled to obtain bread to feed his family.</p>
<p>You say that poverty causes crime. Accordingly, <i> everyone </i> except the kings and queens during the year 1000 should have been criminals. Indeed, the whole world would have been awash with crime, crime, crime.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. While there was crime back in those days, most of the people back then were law abiding.</p>
<p>If you want to debate conservatives in the future, I suggest that you think a little bit longer before you post and come up with better arguements that are not so easily refuted by common sense.</p>

		<p>You cannot get section 8 housing without a kid. the black girls know that to survive they must produce 5 to ten children. since they dont spend much money on them, having more kids guarantees housing and money. so they are being smart not dumb.</p>

A girl pregnant at age 15 or 16 has been a victim of a crime, regardless of whether she consented or not.  Many of the perpetrators are presumably boys at the very same school.

		<p>They grow up with their moms on welfare. They see their friends get pregnant, get thrown baby showers and all that, sign up for WIC and other freebies, get sympathetic white churches in the suburbs to donate new baby items for these &#8220;poor girls&#8221;, get welfare, free day care, free medical care for the kid, free food stamps. I&rsquo;m surprised they&rsquo;re not all pregnant.</p>
<p>Another problem is that there is no stigma any longer about having an illegitimate child. Heck, when I was in high school in the 80s, I remember being in shock to find out that a friend and her boyfriend were &#8220;doing it&#8221; (heh). </p>

<p>Dave, those studies were a foregone conclusion.  You write like a university-educated type, so you must realize that research like that <i>had better verify anti-racist thinking</i> regardless of the truth.  They continually re-shape and ignore facts until finally they have the &#8220;proof&#8221; they set out to find.</p>
<p>Because if they print the truth, they&rsquo;ll be fired.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since you&rsquo;re keen to defend the blacks in their tireless assault on the whites who feed them, I suggest you move to Durban or Johannesburg, where you&rsquo;ll be making excuses for them until they rape you and cut out your tongue to sell for &#8220;muti&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised, reading the comments posted thus far, that no one has thought to blame all of these illegitimate pregnancies on - at least in part - on the disturbing number of young white girls who, following their brainwashing by MTV and other such anti-white, trash media, are allowing themselves to get captured by these scores of predatory, sexually aggressive young black males.</p>
<p>If not for these slutty white girls now presenting opportunities for black males like never before in history, could these young teenage black girls feel an increased desperation to give &#8216;it&rsquo; up, in hopes of hanging on to the only males of any ethnic group who they have much hope of catching?  And, even in schools where white parents have wisely pulled their white daughters out and enrolled them elsewhere, these young black girls still have a clear sense via the anti-white, miscegenation promoting media, that black males are obsessed with chasing white women.   </p>
<p>I have wondered about this possibility.   I&rsquo;ve also  noted, with considerable disgust, that white males appear to be the only group of men who are sufficiently castrated to tolerate these encroachments on their women.  Mexicans, on the other hand, react to these kinds of predatory incursions in the Los Angeles public school districts by rioting and putting an abrupt halt to these violations of nature&rsquo;s rules of conduct.  </p>
<p>So, I ask the $20 thousand dollar question:   How can the prettiest and most coveted women in the entire world not be worth fighting for, guys?</p>

<p>Populations under stress do not reproduce, as is happening to Whites almost everywhere in the world.  White birthrates, with few exceptions, are below  &mdash;  and often far below  &mdash;  replacement levels. </p>
<p>Professor Lynn writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;As Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein showed in their book The Bell Curve, low IQ cannot entirely explain a black crime rate that is six-and-a-half times the white rate. </p>
<p>When blacks and whites are matched for IQ, blacks still commit crimes at two-and-a-half times the white rate&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an opinion, Dave, those are facts presented by researchers, using FBI and Dept. of Justice statistics, each of whom has who made it his life&rsquo;s work to study and report on racial differences.</p>
<p>For this they have been vilified, smeared and attacked physically. </p>
<p>Now, could you show us some research, from reputable sources (tim wise is not a reputable source) showing that blacks fail, commit crimes and exhibit dysfunctional behaviors such as high illegitimacy rates because of White racism and oppression.</p>

<p>Go to any school, in any city, with a student body composed primarily of Blacks, then count the number of pregnant teens. Just as you can go to any city with a large Black subpopulation and see how bad crime is, and who&rsquo;d have thunk it&hellip; Blacks doing most of the reported crimes.</p>

		<p>What is interesting here is that despite a couple decades of supposed welfare reform, we have yet another generation of welfare mothers milking the system for everything the taxpayer can be made to cough up. And they are getting all sorts of new benefits, such as a day care center and all. Whatever happened to that conservative revolution from Reagan onwards which was supposed to have saved the country? </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If you want to know why, the people closest to the situation say there&rsquo;s no simple explanation.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>My God - is the author of this article really that stupid?<br>
</p>
<p>Not so much stupid, but following from a liberal script that refuses to recognize reality. Situations such as the one at Robeson HS are a manifestation in the real world of the liberal mindset, the natural consequences, if you like, of refusing to recognize racial factors in social policy. Of course, mainstream conservatives are doing very little to challenge this mindset. They too buy into the PC ideology which has overwhelmed this country and, indeed, the West.</p>
<p><i>This is why I don&rsquo;t understand the Right&rsquo;s vehement opposition to abortion. I really do understand the theologically based argument against it, but come on- this is the reality. We are growing this huge, seething, violent underclass at a rapid pace. In this environment, life becomes less sacred- in fact, life becomes cheap, indeed.</i></p>
<p>Good point.   It&rsquo;s as if they think that finger wagging and cold showers will somehow solve the problem in time for the next Rush Limbaugh broadcast.</p>
<p>We might also ask liberals why, if legal abortion and birth control were supposed to have solved the problem of unwanted pregnancies, why today we have higher illegitimacy rates than ever in the USA? I suspect this is something that can not be solved by either liberal mantras or conservative bromides but only by a radical revision to our national mindset.</p>
<p><i>But if you people actually got slightly beyond those prejudiced emotionally driven inclinations and looked at some empirical data, you&rsquo;d realize that just having a dark (black) skin has NOTHING to do with phenomenon of teen pregnancy.</i></p>
<p>Except that the race realist argument is that it is not a matter of skin color but of underlying genetic factors: low average IQ, higher sexual hormone saturations,  inability to see longterm consequences, and so forth. But liberal ideology refuses to recognize these genetic factors. Consequently, liberals ascribe pathologies such as the ones described in the article to either &#8220;racism&#8221; or poverty. Liberals can not face up to the reality without having to recant their liberalism. </p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s also interesting how, as usual, a &#8220;liberal&#8221; must misrepresent the race realist position. One might ask the poster why they felt the necessity to do so.)</p>
<p><i> It&rsquo;s purely driven by socioeconomic status - meaning POVERTY and LACK OF OPPORTUNITY. Which, I hate to break to ya folks, is a direct consequence of DECADES long institutionalized segregation and oppression on the part of the &lsquo;white man&rsquo;.</i></p>
<p>And again, we might ask, why then has fifty years of liberal social engineering   &mdash;   in which minorities have been granted every program they have demanded   &mdash;   failed to produce any change in overall black behavior? Exactly how many more decades must pass, and hundreds of billions of dollars be spent, before we see an end to such pathologies? </p>
<p><i> Study after study shows that if you take out these socioeconomic related factors, there is virtually NO difference in teen pregnancy among the races.</i></p>
<p>If so, then please produce these studies. </p>
<p>And let me ask the bigger question: how can we ever solve the &#8220;problem&#8221; of poverty when we have large sectors of people engaged in behaviors   &mdash;   such as illegitimacy   &mdash;   which only perpetuate poverty?</p>

		<p>A discordant note: it is perfectly normal and reasonable for a 17- or 18-year-old young woman to become pregnant. In bygone days, that was the time many white women began building their families of five or more kids. </p>
<p>What is tragic is that these black girls and their children will certainly become public wards at great expense. The young mothers of bygone generations had husbands and means of support. <br>

		<p>Post #33 Dave.<br>
 &#8220;I love how all these comments are a great anonymous outlet of deep seated racist tendencies and frustrations. Typical human social behavior - so it&rsquo;s definitely understandable. Nevertheless funny.</p>
<p>But if you people actually got slightly beyond those prejudiced emotionally driven inclinations and looked at some empirical data, you&rsquo;d realize that just having a dark (black) skin has NOTHING to do with phenomenon of teen pregnancy. It&rsquo;s purely driven by socioeconomic status - meaning POVERTY and LACK OF OPPORTUNITY. Which, I hate to break to ya folks, is a direct consequence of DECADES long institutionalized segregation and oppression on the part of the &lsquo;white man&rsquo;. Study after study shows that if you take out these socioeconomic related factors, there is virtually NO difference in teen pregnancy among the races.&#8221;</p>
<p> Gee whiz you must be brilliant Dave&hellip; most of us never went to high skool and never learnt about all that fancy data stuff&hellip;but. we just know  because we sees it with our own eyes. I guess it is sorta like dat data stuff you wuz talkin about.<br>
I just be havin a B.A. in Criminal Justice from (then now U of M) Memphis State.  <br>
We wuz always studin that fancy stuff and over the last 25 years after graduating. I learned that my professrs were for the most part a bunch of self important imbeciles like yourself. <br>
Hey you pompous meathead why don&rsquo;t you get really educated and question the DATA. How was it gathered? Who paid for the study and what was their agenda when they paid for it? No one gathers DATA without their own biases seeping through. You act like DATA is perfect unmolested truth. (that is a common jr. mistake for those who are just beginning to study the social sciences and arrogantly questions what is as plain as the nose on your face).<br>
 By the way &hellip;. just where is this DATA that you referred to? You arrogantly tell us to study it and then do not make it available for a critical analysis.<br>
 My DATA is 46 years of living in a city densley populated by Blacks. I was one of 7 white sudents in an all black Jr. High. Hell of a lot DATA gathered there I assure you. I have worked with many blacks day in and day out at different jobs over the years&hellip;got a lot of DATA from that too. I watch the news at night where somebody (black or white) was killed by a black 95% of the time. I count that as DATA also.</p>
<p>Yes, many of us maintain annonimity because our opinions could cost us our jobs.   &hellip;By the way what is your full name and address Dave???</p>
