			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Phillips, GothamSchools, October 28, 2090</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The principal of the Bronx&rsquo;s Herbert Lehman High School is charged with changing students&rsquo; failing grades to passing.</p>
<p>Teachers are accusing a Bronx high school principal hired with a $25,000 bonus to improve the school&rsquo;s academics of instead transforming the school into a &#8220;diploma mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transcripts given to GothamSchools by current and former teachers show that in the last year, dozens of students at Herbert Lehman High School have been given credit for courses they failed or never took.</p>
<p>In some instances, a student failed a class, passed the Regents exam by a slim margin, and then had his failing grade overturned. In others, students were given two credits for a class they passed once, or for classes that never appeared on their schedules.</p>
<p>Changing students&rsquo; grades is commonplace in the city&rsquo;s schools and is often done by principals and teachers for legitimate reasons. In some cases, students are given credit recovery, meaning they complete a project, make up work, or re-take part of a class in order to get a passing grade. Other times, students who are on the cusp of passing a class can receive a boost from a Regents exam they passed by a substantial margin.</p>
<p>But teachers said that at Lehman, students are getting credit without doing any work. Dozens of students have had their failing grades overturned without their teachers&rsquo; knowledge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Under Pressure</b></p>
<p>Long considered to be one of the city&rsquo;s best remaining behemoth high schools, Lehman has had a checkered past. At the end of the 2007-08 school year, Lehman&rsquo;s veteran principal [Robert] Leder resigned after investigators found that he had paid two assistant football coaches overtime wages while they were at home.</p>
<p>Leder&rsquo;s replacement, [Janet] Saraceno, arrived the next fall from the High School for Media and Communications, where she was principal. As part of a Department of Education program to lure principals to the city&rsquo;s most challenging schools, she was given a bonus and the title &#8220;executive principal.&#8221; At the time, this perplexed more than a few parents and teachers, who told the city&rsquo;s daily newspapers that they couldn&rsquo;t understand why a school with a &#8220;B&#8221; on its latest report card needed to offer its new principal an extra $25,000 a year.</p>
<p>According to current and former teachers, Saraceno methodically set about increasing the school&rsquo;s 47 percent graduation rate by changing students&rsquo; grades from failing to passing over the objections of their teachers and, in some instances, in violation of state regulations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grade changing is not an entirely foreign phenomenon at Lehman. Teachers who worked under Leder said he sometimes asked them to change student athletes&rsquo; grades if their grade point average slipped below the minimum required for them to play, or if a student was mere points away from passing a class. But that process involved conversations with teachers in which Leder persuaded them to sign the paperwork, they said. Today, failing grades disappear from transcripts without warning, teachers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not long after Saraceno came to Lehman, &#8220;CRs&#8221;  &mdash;  Department of Education jargon for credit recovery  &mdash;  began popping up on students&rsquo; transcripts, replacing failing grades, several former and current teachers said.</p>
<p>In one case, a student failed a math class in the spring of 2006. More than two years later, in the fall of Saraceno&rsquo;s first year as principal, the student&rsquo;s grade was changed from a 55 to a &#8220;CR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Documents show that the reason given for the change was that the student had passed his Regents exam with a score of 69.</p>
<p>According to state education guidelines, a passing Regents score can counteract a failing course grade. But not just any passing Regents score can pull up a failing course grade; a student&rsquo;s two grades are averaged together, with the Regents score counting for a third, and the student only passes if the final product is above 65.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A former teacher said that when she protested the grade change, Saraceno said she&rsquo;d never seen the document and that her signature was only a stamp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Giving Credit Where Credit Is Not Due</b></p>
<p>Transcripts obtained by GothamSchools show other ways students were given credits they didn&rsquo;t earn. In one case, a student&rsquo;s report card showed that he took three English classes in the fall of 2008, passing all of them. However, on his transcript, he was given credit for having taken six English classes that semester. Next to the three courses that never appeared on his report card and that he never actually sat in were three &#8220;CRs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This same student failed English 6 and then retook the class, passing it the second time. While this was done in accordance with department guidelines, what happened next was not: The student was given two credits, as though he had passed two different classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A list of grade changes provided to GothamSchools also shows that students who were constantly truant had their grades changed to passing ones or &#8220;CRs,&#8221; with reasons like &#8220;teacher&rsquo;s request&#8221; or &#8220;home instruction&#8221; given. Leder said that while he was principal, no student with a grade of 45  &mdash;  meaning the student was almost never in school  &mdash;  was eligible for credit recovery, but that has changed in the last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Transcripts also show that Lehman students were given credit for taking after-school classes, which are a common way for schools to offer credit recovery. But at Lehman, records show that some students were given credit for taking after-school classes that teachers say the school never offered. In one case, two students were given credit for taking an after-school math class. Two math teachers who worked at Lehman that year said the class was never taught after school, though they could not produce documents to substantiate the claim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former math teachers said Saraceno also changed their department&rsquo;s grading policy, making it so that 25 percent of a student&rsquo;s grade came from special assignments and projects. Previously, projects could only count for 10 percent. Teachers said students quickly caught on and would come to them, begging for projects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Changed School</b></p>
<p>Lehman teachers say the school is now wrapped in a gloom its students and staff hadn&rsquo;t experienced under Leder, who served as principal for 29 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A former math teacher who now works at another Bronx high school returned to Lehman recently and found it a changed place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hallways are just sad and depressing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one is making anything, putting up any work, and the bulletin boards are all empty and the classrooms are not neat. It felt like a different place. The kids were like dude, you don&rsquo;t even know.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I partially blame NCLB.  What else are teachers and admins at heavily black and Hispanic schools supposed to do when we judge their performance based on how well their intellectually deficient students do?  I don&rsquo;t normally agree with the NEA and other teachers&rsquo; unions on most things, but on the issue of teacher merit pay I do agree.</p>

		<p>As a public school teacher in the 8th largest school district in The United States, I can state unequivocally that this is not an isolated case.  The pressure on &ldquo;us&rdquo; as teachers to promote minority students is intense.  No reasons are accepted by the administration in the local school or in the district, the directive is clear, &ldquo;minority students will be promoted on par with the white students&rdquo;.  It matters not that the IQ of some students may be 30 to 50% below their classmates and their willingness to learn even lower.  All the &ldquo;administration&rdquo; wants are numbers; they want an equal outcome and the numbers to complete their statistical government charts and at the end of the year they can puff out their chest and boast of the wonders they have performed with &ldquo;closing the gap&rdquo; or &ldquo;raising the bar&rdquo; or whatever the phrase of the day is.  The public education system in this nation is a fraud, political correctness and a willing public have made it so.</p>

		<p>I am of two minds on this. On one hand, I sympathize with the teachers because there really isn&rsquo;t anything else they can do. But on the other, I think it&rsquo;s necessary to break the wills of the politically correct teachers and their unions by demanding the impossible of them, because only then will they come to reality.</p>
<p>Punishment of those who fail to achieve the impossible in the form of firings will so destroy the moral of the politically correct that eventually nobody will take up teaching as a livelihood. Only total catastrophe, and the complete and utter ruination of the now worthless public school system will break the will of people who prefer to believe in PC fairy tales.</p>

		<p>In the early 90s, when I was ordered to pass a very obviously retarded (and pregant!) ca 20 year old black woman in an art history course (she was unable to understand ANYTHING AT ALL), I began to understand what this race business has been all about:</p>
<p>Some blacks are smart and talented, but most are pretty limited mentally, and only a few can compete in white society.</p>
<p>Until we admit this, we are trapped in total insanity.</p>
<p>This particlar young woman (who lived with a white foster family) needed birth control more than a FRAUDULENT BA from a manhattan art institute. </p>
<p>Degree or no, no one would even dream of hiring her to clean their apartment, let along to work in a design or advertising firm.</p>
<p>I do not believe the black community has been helped by all of this jabbring insanity. </p>

		<p>This is not peculiar to the USA.  In South Africa after the Marxist terrorist ANC came to power in 1994, black students at many of the universities and colleges rioted with demonstrations demanding &#8220;Pass one, pass all&#8221; meaning that a final year pass must be given basically (including degrees) just for attending the course, the reason being that so many were failing miserably.  The ANC government did not realise that to do so means that, as has happened, anyone from South Africa applying for a professional position anywhere else must be suspect as under qualified.  For example, South African doctors who qualified under the Apartheid regime could be rtelied on to be well qualified (the first successful heart transplant was done in South Africa) Black pilots sentb to Australia for traing to replace the sacked white ones for South African Airways, after the first week, many were returned to SA as being unfit for training as pilots, but the new black govt. insists that affirmative action poolicies where balcks mus be promoted to positions at all levels in govt. and industry must be followed by law.  Hence for me, with te same action being taken with technical staff, as a retired licensed aircraft engineer in years gone by, I will never fly on any aircraft serviced by SAA.  One, a Boeing, was reported to have had an engine fall off the wing last year during take off and only the skill of te (white) pilot savec the lives of all on board.  The last time flew on an SAA aircraft, in 2001 on an internal flight, I reported to the pilot thru the cabin staff that a panel on the starboard wing was only secured by 6 of the 12 screws needed.  The advice was not even acknowledged and the six there were loose.  </p>
<p>Bur schooling is so important where the pursuit of excellence must be the principle, so promoting the passing of incompetents has to be stopped regardless of political expediency.  It is only saving up major problems for that country&rsquo;s future.</p>

		<p>My Mom taught  fourth grade in Houston for 23 years.  By the end in 1977 these little things were going on:</p>
<p>1. a contingent of parents white and mexican told her that the teaching of arithmetic without a calculator was now useless and that they did not want the children graded  on whether or not they could multiply  9 x 8</p>
<p>2.  the same group also stated that being able to name five rivers in Texas was equally useless.</p>
<p>Mom asked what they wanted her to do&hellip; the reply&hellip; &#8220;Give them all A&rsquo;s to reflect how smart we think they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few weeks later a mexican kid pointed a gun at Mom from the hall.  Mom refused to go back to the class room and teach and HISD retired her with full pension.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ironical that nyc is now the most segregated city in America. Manhattan is all white. The black and hispanic people have been pushed out. Many have come the suburbs where I live.These liberals who have fought and manipulated the system to tell Southerners how to live have now opted for a segregated life style. Go figure.</p>

<p><br>
It figures.  I live in Manhattan. My neighborhood is all white. It is full of &#8220;these liberals&#8221; that you mention.  Despite their extravagant sympathies for the &#8220;underprivileged&#8221;  (as long as they&rsquo;re somewhere else, out of sight) we don&rsquo;t have any blacks or hispanics here   &mdash;   except for maids and nannies and workmen who come in during the daytime. But they don&rsquo;t live here. They couldn&rsquo;t afford it.  <br>
It&rsquo;s great! </p>

		<p>Why should there be any outrage when a teacher does what the states have been doing since the introduction of the NCLB laws.<br>
According to this article, 15 states have lowered the standards, dumbing down seems official government policy.</p>

		<p>Why has no one seen the need to send these obviously learning challenged kids to trade schools?  If they were taught how to do jobs that required very little book smarts, and filled a genuine need in this country, we could probalby save much of the economy, as well as save the higher paid jobs for the ones who could actually do them, without allowing them to just sit there and take up space in government jobs while being promoted to positioins where they just sit and whine and bother everyone with their ineptitude.  <br>
I suppose if it were suggested they head for trade schools, it would be considered racist.</p>
<p>And, if I were to go into my child&rsquo;s school today, and see no artwork on the walls, no student essays, nothing but sad gray walls, I would be very upset as a parent, because I expect to see that sort of thing, and it has always been there.  But, then again, we are lucky to be in a school system where the majority of kids are there to learn and care about it.  </p>
