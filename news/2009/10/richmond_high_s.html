			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee and Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 15-year-old girl leaving early from the homecoming dance at Richmond High School was enticed into a darkened alley just off campus to hang out with as many as a dozen young men who were drinking.</p>
<p>When the girl joined in and became drunk herself, police say, the men attacked her.</p>
<p>One after another, as many as six men raped the girl, police said Monday. Others watched. For more than two hours, no one tried to stop the attacks, and no one called police.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s shocking about it is there were so many people willing to involve themselves in such a serious crime,&#8221; police Lt. Mark Gagan said.</p>
<p>Equally shocking, he said, was &#8220;the number of people who witnessed it and who were in the area of it occurring who did not take steps to stop it, report it or help our victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attack happened Saturday about 9:30 p.m., shortly after the girl left the Richmond High gym where the homecoming dance was still going on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Around 11 p.m., the dance let out. Marin Trujillo, a spokesman for the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said the four Richmond police officers and three school administrators who supervised the event had helped to clear the campus.</p>
<p>The attack, however, was happening in an out-of-the way alley just north of campus, police said. In the dark, no one saw a thing.</p>
<p>Somehow, rumors about what was happening finally spread to a house party, Gagan said. A person who heard the story called police around midnight, and when officers showed up, they found the girl, semiconscious, curled up near a lunch table.</p>
<p>Running from the scene was Manuel Ortega, 19, who used to attend Richmond High but dropped out in 2007 to attend a vocational training program, authorities said. Officers caught up to him and arrested him on suspicion of rape, kidnapping and robbery  &mdash;  the assailants stole the girl&rsquo;s jewelry, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richmond may have a reputation for being a rough town, but such an attack on a 15-year-old girl is &#8220;not normal at all,&#8221; Franco said. &#8220;We need to let (the girl&rsquo;s schoolmates) grieve.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While rape is a hideous and reprehensible crime, this girl put herself at risk, by drinking with a bunch of males who were themselves liquored up. That&rsquo;s akin to throwing red meat at a pack of wolves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m NOT saying she got what she deserved - no one deserves to be sexually assaulted -but, she put herself in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>

		<p>Sure do hope the rape victim was not of the 2% at that school. Those onlookers who did nothing also need to be charged as accomplices in the vile act! Don&rsquo;t tell me they couldn&rsquo;t have stopped that rape!  I imagine most were &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;&hellip;gee, what family values they have, as our politicians, and neocon talk show hosts tell us all the time. There is a local talk show host here that has said a few times, that there is nothing or no one more conservative than a &#8220;latino&#8221; mother!  What hogwash and the lemmings buy into it or they are too afraid to call him on his lie.</p>

		<p> Presumably the &#8220;youths&#8221; (one of the media&rsquo;s favorite words) who did the raping were Hispanic, as the name of the one arrested is such. But of what ethnicity was the girl? I can see keeping her identity a secret, but why her ethnicity? Unless, in fact, she was White, and the press doesn&rsquo;t want to call attention to the fact of a Euro-American girl being raped by Mexicans. </p>

		<p>I do have sympathy for the victim, but &hellip;</p>
<p>I watched a documentary recently on &#8216;Bilal Skaf&rsquo; the ring leader of one of our infamous pack rapist gangs here in Oz, who got some international publicity a while back.</p>
<p>I noticed that the common thread amongst the victims was that they all were willingly enticed to go along with these animals, usually from being offered a joint or a drink.<br>
Which seems common with these types of stories.</p>
<p>The fact that they choose to go with these guys in no way excuses the rapists (though it did give their defense the opportunity to use &#8220;it was consensual&#8221; argument) and I&rsquo;m sure that fact has also contributed to the victims blaming themselves.<br>
But it does go to show that there was a point where they the victim had the ability to choose (which must play on their minds).</p>
<p>If anyone is curious, here is the video&hellip;<br>

		<p>I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for a number of years.  And I can tell you that the city of Richmond in Contra Costa County is what Oakland is to Alameda County.</p>
<p>That is to say they are both predominantly black and therefore crime-ridden dung heaps.  So, that this outrage happened in Richmond is really no big surprise.</p>

		<p> There is a great deal of very lose sexual permissiveness amongst many of these lower social classes.. add alchohol and primative music and very sadly even canibalism would not surprise me. When you import primitive cultures and even celebrate them while denouncing the higher European cultures that turned the wilderness into civilization its simply cause and effect.</p>

		<p>What is a 15 year old girl doing going anywhere alone after dark? Why did she join a bunch of hoodlems at a drinking and cracking party? I thought that after Richmond took down Robert E Lee`s statue that all was supposed to wonderful there? What do you want to bet that the &#8221; Don`t snitch,&#8221; word has gone out. I doubt if the  cops will get a single quality witness to come forward. Maybe the Reverend Jackson can come to town and lead a campaign for the cops to give peace a chance. If a Black Muslim girl had been gang raped by now about ten bulls would have become steers; of course no decent Black Muslim young woman would ever have gone down that alley. Where are the black men of Richmond? Why are they not comming forward and demanding justice?<br>

The second was exactly in line with my thinking, which I planned to post here anyway. It`s the realiztion that if you need a reward of $20,000 to get witnesses to come forward in a case like this, they`re just about  as morally bankrupt as the rapists&hellip;</p>

		<p>The chart above tells the tale. I hope the Richmond newspaper runs this story under front page headlines. Rape seems to be a given in some cultures. No big deal. I&rsquo;m sure the young men involved later high-fived each other and gloried in their macho images. Isn&rsquo;t diversity great?</p>

<p>The ONLY benefit that pro-multicultis can come up with - in the UK anyway - is that we can now enjoy a wider range of food in the shops and restaurants. They think that changing a nations traditions, morals, demography, and culture is the price worth paying so they can get a Lebanese or Caribbean takeaway.   </p>

<p>We will probably never know the race of the victim.  And I don&rsquo;t think we need to know.  Rape shield is a good idea.  If not for that, the victim here might be too embarrassed to testify against her assailants, which might be one of the few good pieces of evidence that will be needed to send them to prison.</p>

		<p>I live in L.A. but happened to be in Oakland that night on business. Little did I know at the time that this terrible crime was taking place in nearby Richmond. A number of comments have asked about the race of the victim. Apparently, she is white, based on the video of a friend of hers, another white female student, talking about how whites are in the minority at the school and about school security issues. [In fact, the friend also mentions that a rape occurred at the other high school she (the friend) attended, also at a homecoming dance.] Geez. From reports about the Richmond rape, it seems that onlookers / participants were texting/calling others to come look/participate. This seems plausible, as reports also state that the area where the attack occurred was unlighted and not in open view  &mdash;  -not an area people would naturally come upon in going to/from the dance. </p>

		<p>i am sorry the victim got in the situation but i think it was her choice. dark corner, girl, alcohol and a group of drunk guys spell trouble. she should have known better. another thing, why everyone is so quick to say the perpetrators were black. they were all hispanics. all of them.</p>

		<p>When we ascertain the race of the victim, we should call the DA and insist that hate crime be added, then we can get the death penalty-she was left for dead.  I am calling cell phone companies-ATT, sprint, verizon, and suggesting that they work with the Richmond police in taking cell phone priveleges away from anyway texting, or photographing the incident. I suggested they award 2 to 3 months free phone service to anyone who can identify someone using a cell phone at the site of the crime. That way the police can seize their phones and messages, and we will have it on tape. suspension, deportations, and accessory to the crime charges follow!  Help me pressure the cell phone companies.</p>

Oh!  ALL of them?   Even Cody Ray Smith and Marcelles Peter?</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, let&rsquo;s put it this way:  they were all non-white. </p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t just rape her, they continued to beat her even after she had passed out, and then they left her for dead.  That wasn&rsquo;t just sex, that was an expression of real hate.  She didn&rsquo;t recover consciousness for two and a half hours in the hospital.  She is in critical condition.  </p>
<p>And you belittle this like it&rsquo;s being over-hyped and it was in good part her fault?</p>

		<p>The girl - from what I have ascertained from interviews of her friends - is white - the rapists are all Hispanic expect for one black teen and one white teen - I think the white teen is the one who coerced her to &#8216;join the party&rsquo; and brought her over to have her life ruined - don&rsquo;t know if he participated in the rape - I could also be wrong&hellip;this is just what I have gotten from various stories. Sure we will know at some point as their trials get underway. Someone noted the racial makeup of &#8220;Richmond&#8221; but I have read that the school, Richmond High, is about 70% Hispanic. I live in a part of the Bay Area that is not very Hispanic but I want to move out of California anyway - it&rsquo;s been going downhill for a long time.</p>
