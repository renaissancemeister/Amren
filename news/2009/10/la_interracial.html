<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1016/p02s16-ussc.html">La. Interracial Marriage: Is Life Tougher For Biracial Kids?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, October 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Louisiana justice of the peace Keith Bardwell&rsquo;s refused to marry a white woman and a black man reportedly because he believed that children of an interracial marriage would suffer socially.</p>
<p>That view was once common in the United States, and might have had some basis decades ago when such marriages were taboo and multiracial families were sometimes ostracized. But today, not only are mixed-race children widely accepted but some research suggests they might even have some social advantages.</p>
<p>Researchers are finding that multiracial kids can sometimes be better socially adjusted than single-race offspring. And with the high-profile success of multiracial progeny such as Tiger Woods, Halle Berry, and President Obama (who at his first press conference as president described himself as a &#8220;mutt&#8221;), stereotypes about the split world of the &#8220;tragic mulatto&#8221; have long fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is now threatening a lawsuit if Mr. Bardwell, veteran justice of the peace at Tangipahoa Parish, doesn&rsquo;t step down. The group calls Bardwell&rsquo;s refusal to issue a marriage licence to Beth Humphrey (who is white) and Terence McKay (who is black) both &#8220;tragic and illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist,&#8221; Bardwell told a local newspaper. &#8220;I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;tragic mulatto&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research on mixed-race children once focused on the social and psychological problems that can arise from not feeling like a full member of any racial group. That notion permeated early 20th century American literature through the figure of the &#8220;tragic mulatto,&#8221; who did not fit in with either the black or white world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea that mixed-race children were biologically inferior to white or black kids was also widespread in the South, and often formed the basis of anti-miscegenation laws during Jim Crow years. (Researchers have found that not only is that not true, but that mixed-race offspring tend to be overall more physically attractive than their peers.)</p>
<p>Changing views</p>
<p>But loosening of marriage laws and more-accepting social mores have transformed perceptions of multiracial families. For one thing, there are now 7 million mixed-race kids in the US, up from 500,000 in the 1970s.</p>
<p>A 2008 study of 182 mixed-race high school kids in California found that these kids didn&rsquo;t focus on exclusionary features like skin color or hair texture when thinking about themselves, but instead, they appeared to feel that their heritage made them &#8220;unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kids are able to &#8220;place one foot in the majority and one in the minority group, and in this way might be buffered against the negative consequences of feeling tokenized,&#8221; the study authors wrote in the Journal of Social Issues. The students surveyed included those with mixed Asian, Hispanic heritage.</p>
<p>Other studies suggest that while mixed-race kids may no longer feel the burden of discrimination, they still face unique challenges. A 2008 study led by Harvard researchers found that mixed-race adolescents tend to engage in risky behavior outside of school at higher rates than average and also fare &#8220;somewhat worse on measures of psychological wellbeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>What kind of position are &#8216;researchers&rsquo; in to judge who is physically attractive? That statement may be true if all the peers are black but it is absolutely absurd if the peers are white. My own opinion is that black-white mixes are less attractive than either full black or full white.</p>
<p>One thing that bothers me is the fixation of advertising on mulatto males. What on earth is attractive about huge beige afros they all seem to sport? </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve seldom read a more scurrilously biased piece of &#8220;reporting&#8221; than this story. Who are these so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; who have done &#8220;studies&#8221; that show, surprise, surprise, mixed-race kids are oh, so wonderful? And do you suppose they viewed them that way to start with, then &#8220;found&#8221; in their studies just what they wanted to find?</p>
<p> My experience with black-white half-breeds is that they seem to have a chip on their shoulders about their racial identity, and no, they&rsquo;re NOT more &#8220;physically attractive than their peers.&#8221; They look just like what they are   &mdash;   mongrels. </p>

Typically, no source was given for this hilarious and outrageous claim.  Mulatto children have a lower IQ on average than white children, this is an established FACT.  As for being more physically attractive, sure - but only if their &#8216;peers&rsquo; refers to other blacks.  </p>

		<p><i>mixed-race offspring tend to be overall more physically attractive than their peers</i><p>Researchers <i>&#8220;determined&#8221;</i> this?  How?  Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;beauty in the eye of the beholder&#8221; (or is that type of subjectivity &#8220;racist&#8221; now also)?<p>Apparently, the dogma of &#8220;diversity&#8221; now prescribes standards of beauty as well, clearly designed to promote miscegenation.  In my own experience, black-white unions only seldom produce even arguably attractive offspring, and more often produce children that are ugly to the point of grotesque.  What&rsquo;s worse, is that these children are very often conscious of and resentful of their appearance, and all the politically correct assurances about &#8220;physical attractiveness&#8221; in the world can&rsquo;t convince them otherwise.</p></p></p>

<p>Directly to the south of the United States is the biggest concentration of mulattos on earth, in Central America and the Caribbean, from Mexico and Cuba on down to Brazil.</p>
<p>Being mulatto imparts no advantages, except when you are taken into the white world and given exceptional mentoring by doting whites.</p>

		<p>I still have to ask, is a Justice of the Peace FORCED to marry ANYONE!  Is there a law stating if someone comes to get married a JP HAS to marry them, or CANNOT REFUSE?  I&rsquo;m sure Keith Bardwell knows the answer to that and, by his calm demeanor and shoulder-shrugging of the entire stupid debacle,knows he&rsquo;s within his right.  If so, what is the ACLU going to do to &#8220;punish&#8221; him? How would they &#8220;FORCE&#8221; him to resign if he did not choose to and has broken no law?  I hope Mr. Bardwell hold his ground and thumbs his nose at all this hypocritical hype.</p>

Keep claiming that black hair on brown skin with brown eyes is as exciting as blond hair on white skin with blue eyes.  Keep claiming that a people who have not invented much of anything are just as smart as the people who invented the modern world that you take for granted.  Keep blaming the disparity on oppression instead of genetic causes for productive behavior and intelligence.</p>
<p>The real world is much different than the one you have created in your own mind.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope this guy stands strong.  There is nothing wrong with an interracial couple having to jump through a few extra hoops to get married.  9 times out of 10, it DOESN&rsquo;T work out.  This guy has put a lot on the line, and deserves to be commended.  (actually, while dreaming about utopian schemes like a white homeland, it would be good if pro-white activists worked to get themselves elected to local offices like this, it would give them a potential platform.)  </p>

		<p>Regardless of whether we might agree with the JP&rsquo;s reasoning, I don&rsquo;t think this is a good issue for us.  We should support the right of people to choose who they do and don&rsquo;t want to live around.  And oppose the right of government officials to make that decision for individual citizens.<br>

		<p>Justice Bardwell is very courageous for standing up for his beliefs in the face of great evil.  His explanation, however, is a politically correct one and tainted.  It implies that if mulatto children faced no social stigma, then it would be perfectly alright to race mix in this fashion.  The fact that the overwhelming proportion of such couples involves a white woman and a black man shows that more is at work here than just &#8220;love&#8221;.  Those women are being propagandized from cradle to grave in every insidious way imaginable.  Given this fact, it can reasonably be argued that many white women who choose black men are not even exercising free will.  Indeed, they are like members of a cult who have been brainwashed.</p>

<p>There seem to be a lot of problems with mixed race (black/white) children compared with single race children: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikingly, on fifteen out of the twentyone variables relating to bad behavior mixed race adolescents exhibit worse behavior than both of their single race counterparts. Behavior at school by mixed race adolescents generally mirrors that of blacks, except with regard to exerting effort and skipping school – two dimensions on which mixed race children are significantly worse than blacks. The bad behavior of mixed race children stands out even more clearly outside of school. With the exception of watching television (which blacks do more of), mixed race adolescents are the worst or essentially tied for worst on every other behavior considered. This is true whether the risky behaviors are those more common to whites (e.g. drinking and smoking) or to blacks (e.g. sex and violence). Mixed race adolescents roughly occupy the lower envelope of good behaviors of blacks and whites. In a similar manner Choi et al (2006), using data from four middle schools in Seattle, WA, find that multi-racial adolescents are at greater risk for substance abuse.</p>

<p>Some mixed race children do even better than single race children but when it comes to the children of black/white couples they seem to be at a disadvantage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Powell and his colleague Simon Cheng at the University of Connecticut found one exception to the &#8220;biracial advantage.&#8221; Black father/white mother families tend to invest fewer resources into kids than do black monoracial couples and white monoracial couples.&#8221; <br>

		<p>To hell with the children argument.  The real reason intelligent whites don&rsquo;t marry non-whites is because it causes genocide of the white genotype.  The false and harmful belief that miscegenation is not harmful is the modern version of the belief in a flat Earth.</p>
<p>God  &mdash;  the real God, not the phony do your own thing god invented by humans  &mdash;  is against miscegenation because it stops evolution and creates devolution. </p>

		<p>Actually, there is a biracial advantage: It&rsquo;s called affirmative action.  Universities and employers love mulattos: they&rsquo;re black enough to count in diversity statistics, yet more intelligent and adept at interacting with whites than their full-black peers.  The truth is, there aren&rsquo;t many intelligent blacks to go around; colleges and corporations have to fight it out over the small pool of minimally qualified blacks.  If you&rsquo;re an intelligent, law abiding mullatto you have a huge advantage in obtaining admission at an elite university or obtaining a position at a high-profile employer over better qualified whites.</p>

		<p>Miscegenation has had some good outcomes and some which are less so. Good outcomes include Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Halle Berry and Philippa Schuyler. Less positive outcomes include India, Egypt, Brazil, Haiti and most of the rest of Latin America. <br>
I do not believe that any level of government, including justice of the peace in Louisiana, should determine whether adults can marry. In a free society, government&rsquo;s only function should only uphold noncoercive contracts. Laws against miscegenation have not worked and would not, probably not even in a police state.<br>
There should be no limitation on the freedom of speech or of the press for people to tell the truth about the results of miscegenation.<br>
Among other negative results, it would mean the extermination of both the White and Black races. Therefore, if we lived in a free and logical society, nobody can be accused of the dreaded accusation of &#8220;racism&#8221;, similar to the accusation of witchcraft during the Dark Ages, for opposing miscegenation. Actually, those who favor it are enemies of the White, Black and other races.</p>

		<p>From reading through this Harvard report myself, I see that it&rsquo;s a growing demographic who seem very troubled, are academically in between Blacks and Whites but in terms of anti social behavior worse than Blacks.<br>
It all gets explained away due to their low comparative no.s and their disadvantaged economic backgrounds.<br>
Their only positives being perceived attractiveness(?), lower learning disabilities (who knew) and some advantages in accepting more one than one culture, though they can lay claim to both cultures but neither completely. </p>
<p>As Waspy has also done, snippets from the report&hellip; <br>
<a href="/faculty/fryer/files/MR_20KIDS_207.1.08.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/MR%20KIDS%207.1.08.pdf</a></p>

On the physical dimension, mixed race children parallel<br>
whites. School achievement results are intermediate between blacks and whites. Strikingly,<br>
however, mixed race children engage in substantially more risky/anti-social behavior than either<br>
blacks or whites, especially outside of school. Of the twenty-one different bad behavior<br>
variables that we analyze, mixed race adolescents are worse than both blacks and whites on 15 of<br>
them; they fall in between blacks and whites on the remaining 6 measures. Mixed race children<br>
also fare somewhat worse on measures of psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Page 13.<br>
Mixed race adolescents have family incomes<br>
similar to black children and have the same likelihood of having a father in the home. The<br>
parents of mixed race children are less likely to have been married than those of other races<br>
(although rates of ever married are higher than for these mothers than for blacks).</p>
<p>Page 14.<br>
Figure 6 plots our set of physical variables. Mixed race birth weights look more like<br>
whites than blacks. Differences in adolescent height and BMI are small. Mixed race adolescents<br>
are rated as .41 standard deviations more attractive than white children, and .47 standard<br>
deviations more attractive than blacks<br>
{snip}<br>
Behavior at school by mixed race adolescents generally mirrors<br>
that of blacks, except with regard to exerting effort and skipping school – two dimensions on<br>
which mixed race children are significantly worse than blacks. The bad behavior of mixed race<br>
children stands out even more clearly outside of school. With the exception of watching<br>
television (which blacks do more of), mixed race adolescents are the worst or essentially tied for<br>
worst on every other behavior considered.</p>
<p>Page 15.<br>
Broadly summarizing, the data on mixed race black-white children suggests that they grow<br>
up in home environments that are similar to blacks, have academic achievement in between that<br>
of whites and blacks, but engage in much more risky behaviors and are slightly worse off<br>
psychologically.</p>
<p>Page 22.<br>
V. Conclusion<br>
The number of mixed-race children has increased dramatically. {snip}. <br>
Using the Add Health data set, we<br>
find high rates of risky/anti-social behavior on the part of mixed race adolescents on virtually<br>
every dimension we are able to measure</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;on the subject of mixed race people being more attractive, to you the jury I present exhibit A.<br>

		<p>I have knwon quite a few black white mixes, and yes, they are often strikingly attractive - i.e., more so than either parent.</p>
<p>If this is news as AMREN; then all I can say is, you people need to get out a lot more.<br>
I though even the most rabid racists had heard of hybrid vigor. </p>
<p>My mixed race friends had no problems in white middle class neighborhoods, but lots of problems in black hoods - and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend working class Irish hoods either.</p>

		<p>Actually, biracial individuals are more attractive than monoracial individuals. The main reason why biracial individuals are more attract is that they are more symmetrical, and symmetry is one of the most important determinants of attractiveness. When you guys deny the higher average attractiveness of biracial individuals, you act like the liberals who deny the evidence for racial differences in intelligence.</p>
<p>With that said, black-white biracial individuals are significantly less intelligent than pure whites or pure Asians, but significantly more intelligent than blacks (pretty good evidence for genetic differences in intelligence, eh?). In our world, intelligence is far more important than attractiveness, so mulattoes do not have any net advantages over pure whites.<br>

		<p>Well, I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that the black male in this situation is actually &#8220;buying the cow&#8221; so to speak. The usual series of events in a BM/WF relationship is for the BM to knock the WF up without first marrying her, then abandon her shortly after the birth of the child, leaving her and her parents to care for it. </p>

<p>&#8220;I am for socialism, disarmament, and ultimately, for abolishing the state itself as an instrument of violence and compulsion. I seek social ownership of property, the abolition of the properties class, and sole control of those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal. It all sums up into one single purpose &mdash; the abolition of dog-eat-dog under which we live. I don&rsquo;t regret being part of the communist tactic. I knew what I was doing. I was not an innocent liberal. I wanted what the communists wanted and I traveled the United Front road to get it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Poster #11 RandyB gets it right. This is about freedom of association, which we all want, and about a government agent who wants to interfere in private relationships. We don&rsquo;t want the government telling us who we can live sell our house to, or force us to bus our children for the sake of integration. Interracial marriage and children, unwise as they are, is not the issue. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that AR posters who rightly resent affirmative action and the like, suddenly favor high-handed interference in private lives from this JP.  </p>

<p> (I recall a Puerto Rican woman in knew in New York, who had lived there for many years.

Actually, there is a biracial advantage: It&rsquo;s called affirmative action. <br>
Universities and employers love mulattos &hellip; truth is, there aren&rsquo;t many intelligent blacks to go around;  colleges and corporations  fight  over the small pool of minimally qualified blacks. If you&rsquo;re an intelligent, law abiding mullatto you have a huge advantage in obtaining admission at an elite university or obtaining a position at a high-profile employer &hellip;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I have written here before, speculating on a future world where race-mixing will be  promoted or mandated in some way by government, either through laws or by more subtle inducements and temptations, such as tax reductions, child allowances,  housing preferences,  scholarships, promotions, etc. The carrot or the stick, in other words. </p>
<p>I see now that I was mistaken and naive in assigning those speculations to the future.   We already have it right now, at least the start of it.  </p>
<p>White people contemplating marriage  will think twice whether their future children  (if pure white) will be shunted aside in all walks of life and will end up as janitors behind a broom.  On the other hand, if they opt to marry colored, their children will be given all the best and will enjoy all the preferences that society can confer, eventually holding high-paid jobs and prestigious social positions.  Many whites will stop and think twice  and will find this option tempting. </p>
<p>In the meantime, we can be sure that mixed-breeds such as Obama and Holder will do everything in their power to encourage it. In fact, their example alone will be sufficient to convince many gullible whites that colored kids is the way to go.</p>

		<p>Not so, Shawn (#26)!  I&rsquo;m an early-twenties woman of Germanic descent, and I am always uncomfortable in the presence of half-breeds.  Every time I see one of my peers (white women) with a non-white man, I shudder inwardly.  It almost feels as though a part of myself has been violated.</p>
<p>This is not to say that miscegenation isn&rsquo;t more commonly accepted today   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t know many other people of my age group who feel as I do.  However, don&rsquo;t give up on us entirely.

Halle Berry is considered beautiful but she had a nose job, she has type 2 diabetes and her hair is fake.  I don&rsquo;t consider unhealthy and fake to be beautiful.  Her octaroon child is alien in appearance as I find most octaroons to be.  I have seen many unattractive amerasians too.  Another thing I have noticed is kids who have light skin but dark teeth because one parent is white and the other parent is a dark caucasian.  </p>

		<p>I wonder what criteria they used to determine that mixed race children were more attractive than either parent?  Did a group of liberals get to together and decide this because it suits their agenda?  I can remember when Hollywood designated Halle Berry the most beautiful actress even though there were far more prettier White women than her.  It didn&rsquo;t stop there either.  They had to constantly keep reinforcing it in the media over a period of months.  If someone really is beautiful you don&rsquo;t have to constantly remind people of it, they&rsquo;ll just know it.  I firmly believe that if they had put another actress with more sex appeal in that movie &#8220;Catwoman&#8221; it never would have flopped.  Michelle Pfeiffer played an incredible looking Catwoman in &#8220;Batman Returns&#8221; and would have been amply suited for the role, although she was probably too old by the time the movie went into production.  The same fawning occurred over our resident mulatto in the White House.  I was nauseated at all the people in the media talking about how good looking he is even though he could have played the lead vampire in that old &#8220;Salem&rsquo;s Lot&#8221; movie. </p>

		<p>My thoughts:</p>
<p>The marriage should have been permitted. Any northwest European woman who would willingly bed down with a black deserves nothing but the sharply negative consequences she will certainly feel as a result in the long-run. Plus, why would a race want to keep an individual who would do such a disgusting thing anyway? Let her leave and suffer the consequences&hellip;</p>
<p>On the idea of &#8216;biracial advantage&rsquo;: Extreme outbreeding is just as negative as extreme inbreeding. The ideal mate is someone who is geneticall close, but not a relative. The whole notion that these crosses are somehow &#8216;superior&rsquo; is complete nonsense. Even though I am totally unconvinced that these crosses are somehow &#8216;more attractive,&rsquo; on average, that would be a very poor argument even if it were true; the most important trait today for getting ahead is not &#8216;attractiveness&rsquo;, it is intelligence. And on that critical trait, these crosses will, of course, display an &#8216;in-between&rsquo; average intelligence, lower than the average for the high-scoring race, and higher than the average for the low-scoring race. A few exceptions to the contrary do not contradict the observed RULE that these mixes display lower average intelligence than average for the higher-scoring race. How can that possibly be a &#8216;superior&rsquo; result?</p>

<p>Those very rare ones  who do look good are grabbed up and made into movie stars and supermodels.   Those are the ones we see shoved before us.  But in real life, you see very few  Halle Berrys or Harry Belafontes out there on the street.</p>
<p>The exception to the rule  does not prove anything</p>

		<p>For those still interested in the question of so-called &#8220;hybrid vigor&#8221; as applied to humans, my research has turned up a 1967 study out of Hawaii by Newton E. Morton, Chin S. Chung and Ming-Pi Mi entitled &#8220;Genetics of interracial crosses in Hawaii,&#8221; described as &#8220;a large, well-designed study of interracial crosses in Hawaii, [which] found <b>no significant beneficial effects among the offspring of an inter-racial cross when compared to offspring whose parents were from the same racial group</b>.&#8221;  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ykqgsef" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ykqgsef</a> There is no study which I could find that meaningfully contradicted this study&rsquo;s conclusions, except for a small number of cases - such as the relationship of homozygotes vs. heterozygotes to sickle cell disease-, and certainly no study concluding from data that human mixed race individuals display overall &#8220;hybrid vigor.&#8221;<p>Given the persistence and indeed conscious promotion of myths that mixed race individuals are better adapted genetically or more physically attractive (with the transparent goal of encouraging miscegenation among well-meaning whites), it is all the more important to emphasize that a reputedly well designed scientific study which specifically tested this hypothesis not only failed to confirm it, but specifically concluded that on the contrary there were <b>&#8220;no significant benefits&#8221;</b> genetically from such race-mixing. </p></p>

		<p> Historama says:  &#8220;the most important trait today for getting ahead is not &lsquo;attractiveness&rsquo;, it is intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I disagree. I speak from experience. For a female, the advantages of nice legs, a shapely form, and a pretty face outweigh any amount of intelligence in the work place.  Those lustful  &#8220;Hostile Elite&#8221;  managers who are looking you over don&rsquo;t care about your intelligence.  IQ will get you nowhere.  That&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>

		<p>The judge claims mulatto kids suffer&hellip; Probably true but as I see it not nearly as much as the manifold amount of white people in a white area that now (must) accept Susy&rsquo;s &#8220;o so cute little mullatto boy&#8221; she came home from college with. And the previously white elementary school that will now be introduced to the little dark &#8216;prince&rsquo; that will have his pick of higher evolved white girls to chose from.&#8221;to their fathers horror&#8221;.. in parallel with the anti white propaganda taught these little kids in the name of justice. Genetic competition has subtle forms&hellip;When white people openly prefer the intimate company of other whites its now called Hitlerish and anti Christian racism.. But when A black man removes himself completely from other blacks including a mate he&rsquo;s considered open minded and tolerant. Funny &hellip;why isn&rsquo;t it racism when a black prefers intimate company with whites? This judge is trying to up hold  natural order in a world that has temporarily forsaken it.</p>

		<p>Two points.  One, all mixed race persons are not alike.  There&rsquo;s a huge difference between White and one of the Asian races, and black and anything else.  Two, and more importantly, any mixed race person is not White, and will, in our society, work against the continuation and betterment of the White race.</p>

<p>This casual and unquestioning acceptance of race-mixing and its side products ties in with the general decline of morality that we have seen over the post 40 years since the  &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era.  It&rsquo;s no coincidence that acceptance of immoral behavior has accompanied acceptance of integration. They go hand in hand.</p>
<p>I am speaking of &#8220;single mothers&#8221;, &#8220;one parent families&#8221;,  and all the other careful euphemisms that have been invented to avoid confronting harsh reality with blunt terms.  The English language has old, old terminology that covers the topic of children conceived out of wedlock (even aside from the racial aspect) and the language was candid in its condemnation.  But words such as bastard and trollop are no longer used in this &#8220;kinder, gentler&#8221; age. No, not all &#8220;bastards&#8221; are mulattoes, but it seems that most mulattos are &#8220;bastards&#8221;. Why is that? So, to accept one, we have to be conditioned to accept the other. </p>
<p>In another time, not so long ago, Suzy would have gone off quietly  somewhere for a &#8220;vacation&#8221;; then she would have given up her little half-breed for adoption and the matter would never have been mentioned again.  Now, she proundly brings her little Obama home to mommy and daddy  (who will end up raising it, while she runs off with another non-white), and the whole community is supposed to applaud and coo over how cute and talented the little fellow is.  Any slightest word or sign of disappoval would be considered  &#8220;racisss&#8221;.  Horrors!  Shame on YOU, not on HER.</p>
<p>Ah, how far we&rsquo;ve fallen! </p>

<p>Along with what you say about &#8220;bastard,&#8221; (though I think we&rsquo;ve buried the term b/c it blames the child for the behavior of his or her parents, though &#8220;bastardy,&#8221; another passe word, has the same sting for the parents, but does not blame the offspring), I have noticed that the words &#8220;bachelor&#8221; and &#8220;divorcee&#8221; have similarly disappeared (save a few TV show titles).  I think the reason why words like that were used once upon a time was to heap subtle shame on those adults who were either not yet married or divorced, to enshrine marriage as the normal state of being.  Now, in both cases, &#8220;single&#8221; is the word we&rsquo;re supposed to use.  I think it goes hand in hand with the decline of marriage.</p>

<p><br>
As a parallel to that, I have noticed that such words as &#8220;husband&#8221;, &#8220;wife&#8221; and &#8220;spouse&#8221; have apparently fallen into disfavor, being replaced by the trendy (and non-gender specific) term, &#8220;partner&#8221;.  In the same way, waiters and waitresses are now &#8220;servers&#8221;,  policewomen are police officers, firemen are are &#8220;fire fighters&#8221;, airline stewardesses have become &#8220;flight attendants&#8221;, etc.   </p>
<p>Our whole language is being re-written for us. How kind of them!  Were we ever consulted about this?  And who are &#8220;they&#8221;?   </p>

		<p>I thought ACLU was supposed to protect civil rights.  If a judge doesn&rsquo;t want to grant a marriage license, then they can somewhere else.  A judge doesn&rsquo;t have to grant a marriage license anymore than a lawyer has to take on a case that he finds morally reprehensible.</p>

		<p>Keith Bardwell is an elected official and can&rsquo;t be forced out by anyone.  If he doesn&rsquo;t wish to marry interracial couples, that&rsquo;s his perogative and his actions will be judged by the voters in his re-election bid.  This is along the same lines as a doctor refusing to perform an abortion because he finds it morally repulsive.  </p>

		<p>I saw a black man on Jerry Springer married to a psychotic white woman who was basically a baby machine. He for some reason loved her, but refused to have sex because she was trying to get pregnant. He stated that he didn&rsquo;t want to bring any mixed-race children into the world. He sounded sensible and no one argued with him. Why is it wrong for a white person to make the same statement?</p>
