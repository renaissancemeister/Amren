<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/20/bnp-membership-list-analysis">Analysis of a Party  &mdash;  What the BNP List Says About Its Members</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Booth, Simon Rogers and Paul Lewis, Guardian (Manchester), Oct. 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The leak of a British National party membership database provides a detailed anatomy of an organisation whose growing public profile means that this week it will enjoy the most prominent platform in its history when Nick Griffin, its leader, appears on Question Time on BBC1.</p>
<p>The BNP&rsquo;s constitution states it is &#8220;committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948&#8221;. The party also proposes &#8220;firm but voluntary incentives for immigrants and their descendants to return home&#8221;. Only last week did it agree to alter its overtly racist constitution which bans non-whites from joining. But who are the people who join such an organisation and who does Griffin represent?</p>
<p>This morning BNP officials began scouring the document but could not confirm or deny whether it is genuine. According to the Guardian&rsquo;s analysis of the available data a typical supporter is likely to be called David, John, Paul or Michael and he is likely to have a &#8220;standard&#8221; membership which means he has a paying job. The most common names among the BNP&rsquo;s 2,034 female members are Patricia, Joanne and Karen, and the largest concentration of BNP members is in Charnwood, a Conservative-controlled East Midlands constituency.</p>
<p>If this picture makes the supporter base of the BNP sounds very normal, bland even for a party that concerns so many opponents of far right politics, then that impression will only be reinforced by the different types of membership available, including &#8220;family&#8221;, &#8220;family plus&#8221;, &#8220;old age pensioner&#8221; and &#8220;gold&#8221;  &mdash;  a £60 membership for members whom Griffin describes as &#8220;the elite of the party&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not everyone who joins is quite as ordinary as these descriptions suggest. The latest list also reveals that the membership include dozens of doctors, majors, captains and corporals.</p>
<p>BNP spokesman Simon Darby, said today that at first glance the list includes some people who are no longer members and some who have moved abroad. Nick Griffin, the party&rsquo;s leader, said the list could contain people who have shown an interest in the party but have not become members.</p>
<p>The list does not show as many members as the BNP claims to have. Darby said membership had grown recently, partly as a result of anger at the MPs&rsquo; expenses scandal, and has now reached around 14,000. But the data seen by the Guardian, which appears to be a snapshot at the end of April 2009, shows 11,811 members. It is not clear if it is comprehensive and when the list of the BNP&rsquo;s membership at the end of 2007 list was leaked in November 2008, it showed 12,802 names. Some of those were not full members and had only showed an interest in the party.</p>
<p>But it is the geographical spread of the BNP&rsquo;s members which is most revealing about where the far right&rsquo;s power base comes from. The greatest concentrations of BNP membership are in the East Midlands, in the urban areas around the Pennines and in Essex.</p>
<p>Charnwood in Leicestershire is the parliamentary constituency with the largest number of BNP members with 63. The area borders Leicester, one of the most ethnically diverse in the country. The BNP won 3.4% of the vote and came fourth at the 2005 general election more than trebling the party&rsquo;s share of the vote since 1997. It includes Loughborough&rsquo;s Soar Valley in the suburbs just north of Leicester, villages from the other bank of the Soar river, Thurmaston to the north-east of Leicester and to the city&rsquo;s west it covers Glenfield, Ratby and Leicester Forest East.</p>
<p>The BNP has one councillor on Charnwood borough council, Cathy Duffy, who represents the village of East Goscote. The neighbouring constituency of Loughborough is also home to BNP 46 members.</p>
<p>The next membership hotspot is the Pendle constituency in Lancashire, which includes mill towns and villages where many people of south Asian origin have settled. In 2008, the BNP councillor Brian Norton Parker distributed leaflets which alleged: &#8220;Muslims are exclusively responsible for the heroin trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amber Valley in Derbyshire and Ashfield in Nottinghamshire each have 59 members. In a trend that suggests the party&rsquo;s influence is spreading, if not growing in absolute terms, the fastest growing membership  &mdash;  compared with the data leaked last year  &mdash;  are in areas outside the party&rsquo;s current heartlands. The number of members in Salisbury in Wiltshire has trebled to 36, while Barnsley Central in Yorkshire has 48, Hastings and Rye in East Sussex have 32, and Orpington in Kent has 25. There have been significant falls in Leeds and Keighly, in Yorkshire, and Carlisle in Cumbria.</p>
<p>The data also appears to shows a party in a constant state of flux with many supporters allowing their memberships to lapse each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens is the membership flow acts like a bath with running water and the plug missing,&#8221; said Nick Lowles, editor of Searchlight, a magazine which monitors far-right groups. &#8220;People join the party, because they&rsquo;re angry, agitated or curious, but they leave in equal numbers out of the bottom. We believe their turnover rate is far higher than any other political party.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that moles who operate inside the BNP on behalf of Searchlight have said the party&rsquo;s electoral success in the European elections in June, as well as the recent spurt in media coverage, have not resulted in a surge of support. &#8220;My understanding is that their membership hasn&rsquo;t changed in any great way over the last six to eight months,&#8221; said Lowles.</p>
<p>Analysis after the last year&rsquo;s leak, he continued, showed that the BNP&rsquo;s membership consisted of mainly middle-aged white men who worked in semi-skilled jobs. Membership lists can, however, give a skewed impression of the BNP&rsquo;s supporters and voters. &#8220;The fact is a that a lot of BNP supporters wouldn&rsquo;t join a political party,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lowles said recent falls in the BNP&rsquo;s share of the vote at council byelections, including a seat in Barnsley last week, indicated that party&rsquo;s increased national profile in recent weeks as a result of Griffin&rsquo;s forthcoming appearance on Question Time was not translating into electoral success.<br/>

		<p>These are normal, everyday, professional people that have determined that the multicult agenda that the British press and government have pushed on them is a total lie. That&rsquo;s what the race baiters and leftists don&rsquo;t understand.  For every native Briton that is a member of the BNP, there are hundreds who agree with them.  I truly believe the tide is turning.</p>

		<p>In the run up to BNP leader Nick Griffin appearing on the BBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Question Time&#8221; this coming Thursday, the British media is going into a frenzy of condemnation, with anti - BNP opinion pieces, editorials, and news reports.  This shows that someone, somewhere is getting very worried.  MP Peter Hain - a South African born Communist, and senior Labour Party spokesman - has even called for legal action against the BBC to try and prevent Mr Griffin from appearing.  The above article, in the UK&rsquo;s most PC, liberal newspaper is actually quite tame.   </p>

		<p>Poster Eric has a point. Just because many BNP voters may not be actual members of the BNP, that doesn&rsquo;t mean much. Many voters can be thought of as &#8220;stealth&#8221; or &#8220;shadow&#8221; BNP members, especially when they go to their polling places to vote. That&rsquo;s why BNP may have only 11,000 official members, but their support is much greater.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar situation here in the USA when it comes to the National Rifle Association. The NRA has, within its own ranks, about 4 million dues-paying members. Yet, according to NRA, about 21 million Americans consider themselvess NRA members, when they are not officially recognized as such. In some cases, they may have been former members, who let their membership lapse. In other cases, many gunbuyers -especially purchasing a gun for the first time- may assume that automatically makes them NRA members (it doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Right now, I would say there are some 90 to 100 million gunowners in America, thanks in no small measure to uneasiness over the Obama regime. Not all of them are NRA members, of course, but they are receptive to the NRA&rsquo;s message regarding their Second Amendment rights. They go to the polls and vote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the left, the gun grabbers and the MSM don&rsquo;t get it either. They&rsquo;re left scratching their heads in wonder, as to how a 4 million member organization can determine election results. </p>
<p>Think of the BNP as an orchestra. Nick Griffin is the conductor (party leader), and the party members are the orchestra players, who actually make the music.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny that someone should mention Peter Hain - the Labour mimister who&rsquo;s been must vociferous in his blatant and undemocratic rantings in trying to bully the BBC into cancelling Nick Griffin&rsquo;s TV appearance.<br/>
 Hain has whipped himself up into a frenzy and keeps uttering dark threats about taking legal action against the BNP, apparently merely because the BNP has the gall to exist.<br/>
 Way back in 1976, Peter Hain was postively identified by four witnesses (including the bank cashier who was terrorized by a gun), for the armed robbery of a branch of Barclay&rsquo;s Bank in Putney, south London.Hain stood trial for the robbery, but incredibly was acquitted.<br/>

		<p>Interesting.  What I&rsquo;ve heard is that the supposedly new link membership list is composed of the old list, inquiries and then thousands of people who never had anything to do with the party.</p>
<p>Essentially it really isn&rsquo;t a leak at all, just a made up list.</p>
<p>3) I prefer reading The Sun for my daily dose of lies about the BNP.  It&rsquo;d be quite funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad and pathetic.</p>

		<p>My name and personal contact details are on the first list of B.N.P. Members.I haven&rsquo;t seen the second list and am not interested in seeing it.I joined the B.N.P. for one year and did not renew my membership.I joined as I was disgusted by the way Nick Griffin and Mark Collet were dragged through the Courts by New Labour.I also made a couple of contributions to help with their legal costs.<br/>
When the list was published my membership had elapsed but I was described as an Activist even though I had never met another B.N.P. member.Just lies,lies and more lies.I support the B.N.P. and will vote for them at the next chance as I did in the European elections.I have a B.A. Hons Degree and also another set of letters after my name. </p>

		<p>It used to be said, particularly among conservatives, that you can&rsquo;t beat totalitarians by playing by the rules since if you start to win they&rsquo;ll just change the rules.   Isn&rsquo;t the goal to encourage groups like the BNP to engage in peaceful, democratic methods?  The Left won the culture wars throughout the West and such is their power that they no longer have to pay even lip service to ideas like free speech and free association.   The BNP has no chance of ever assuming power or even becoming a major player in British politics at anytime in the foreseeable future.   The most they can do is be a nagging little voice that causes whites, particularly lower class whites,  to perhaps believe they have group rights and interests.   Another characteristic of successful totalitarian movements is that they crush all noticeable dissent even at the smallest level.   All this isn&rsquo;t about fear of the BNP,  it&rsquo;s about fear that one day the white majority in Britain will reject the values of the white-loathing leftist elite.   It should be noted in passing that several other European countries have BNP-like parties and they haven&rsquo;t imploded yet.   </p>

<p>Be that as it may; it is a well known fact that Peter Hain, when fighting the civilising influence that made South Africa a viable civilisation, was on record as spreading brass tacks and broken glass on rugby pitches when there were games to which he was ideologically opposed.</p>
<p>On another note, it is interesting, listening to Jack Straw&rsquo;s provenance, the basis of his political agenda not just on Question Time this evening, but also more generally in his political career.<br/>

		<p>One of the tactics used by the Powers that be is to program the silent majority to believe that all White nationalists are skinhead-type thugs wearing Doc Martin&rsquo;s boots and wielding baseball bats and jack-knives. That&rsquo;s a classic!</p>
<p>I guess this cliché is spread the way it is, so that «normal», decent people with nationalist feelings will stay away from parties like the BNP and the like.</p>

<p>Definately! And it works like a charm. The general public actually believe that to be a White nationalist is to be a member of a &#8216;Romper-Stomper&rsquo; style gang that randomly attacks Asians. Either that or you&rsquo;re called a &#8216;facist&rsquo; (normally in a shrill tone). The next time someone calls you a &#8216;fascist&rsquo; ask them &#8216;What is a fascist?&rsquo; That will shut them up.</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;&hellip;moles who operate inside the BNP on behalf of Searchlight&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is this &#8216;organisation&rsquo; scared of? People that don&rsquo;t agree with them?<br/>
Democracy in action in the UK!</p>
