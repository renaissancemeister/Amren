<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The graduation rate for Hispanic students in Northern Virginia remained far below that of other students, despite pockets of improvement, according to numbers released Tuesday by the state&rsquo;s Department of Education.</p>
<p>In Fairfax, the state&rsquo;s largest district, 73 percent of Hispanic students graduated with the class of 2009, down from 74 percent in 2008. About 95 percent of their white peers earned a diploma.</p>
<p>In Alexandria, 65 percent of Hispanic students reached the academic milestone, compared with 87 percent of white students. Even so, that&rsquo;s up from 58 percent for the class of 2008. In Arlington, the rate jumped to 69 percent from 64 percent, while 96 percent of white students graduated.</p>
<p>The dropout rate of Hispanic students topped 20 percent for the class of 2009 in all areas but Loudoun County, with the majority quitting school by their junior year.</p>
<p>Overall graduation rates in the Virginia suburbs improved last year in all but Fairfax County, where it fell slightly to about 90 percent for the more than 13,000 students who entered the class of 2009. In 2008, about 91 percent of students graduated.</p>

		<p>Most Hispanics and nearly the entire black population, don&rsquo;t have the necessary discipline to stay the course.  The reason?  They would much rather be out and around than doing intellectual exercises.  Tribal instincts in them are very strong. </p>
<p>Too, they think anyone is a fool if he opts for long term planning which would delay gratifying their immediate needs and desires.</p>
<p>But, worry not.  When they&rsquo;re 30 years old and are still working for minimum wage&hellip;when they&rsquo;re not in jail&hellip;.they&rsquo;ll blame their lack of success on oppression and racism by white males.</p>

		<p>As we further decline in every parameter that can be tracked on paper, will they ever admit that it&rsquo;s the browning of America that&rsquo;s pulling down the averages?  Until they can show me that Whites are declining in these measures, I&rsquo;ll just assume it&rsquo;s the averages being driven down by certain ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Those with average IQs of 90 (hispanics) are struggling with the high school curricula well before the 11th grade-even one that has been dramatically dumbed-down specifically for them and other NAMs.  The average hispanic 12-grader reads and does math at the level of an average White 8th grader.</p>

<p>White racism, however, will be blamed and not the limits of the hispanic students&rsquo; cognitive abilities.  Race-base activists will demand and receive more money to implement extremely expensive race-based special programs to do the impossible  &mdash;  raise hispanic academic achievement to that of Whites and Asians.</p>

		<p>Why stay in school when crime pays better?  It&rsquo;s a whole lot easier to go gang banging, rob and steal from people than work.  We even have a government that will support them.</p>

		<p>Do away with one size all every one expected to go to college high schools. Track students by skills; establish small, multi occupation based schools. Enough of the liberal hypocirsy that we are all the &#8220;same&#8221; and &#8220;equal&#8221;. Bright white kids should not have to endure the noisy chaos of blacks and hispanics in their schools.</p>

		<p>The usual reaction to such an article is to ask what we, the White saviors of the brown race, can do to raise the achievement of people with IQs in the double digits. No matter how you cut it, you can&rsquo;t make them Einsteins just by catering to them. </p>
