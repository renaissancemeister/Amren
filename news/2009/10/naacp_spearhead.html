<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091005/US.Prison.Voting/">NAACP Spearheads Prison Vote Drive in Maine</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clarke Canfield, Comcast.net News, October 5. 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NAACP is registering voters at prisons in Maine, one of just two states that allow all inmates to vote while behind bars, in what is apparently the nation&rsquo;s first such statewide drive.</p>
<p>The relatively few votes at stake  &mdash;  only a few hundred  &mdash;  mean the drive&rsquo;s potential to affect outcomes this fall on such issues as gay marriage, marijuana laws and tax limits is low.</p>
<p>Though prison inmates tend to skew to the Democratic side, the drive isn&rsquo;t about furthering any political agenda, said Rachel Talbot Ross, president of the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about establishing strong voter patterns and becoming a fully functioning person to re-enter society,&#8221; Ross said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s part of the rehabilitation and re-entry process.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not focusing just on black inmates.</p>
<p>Volunteers already have registered an estimated 200 or more inmates at five of the state&rsquo;s seven adult correctional centers. The Maine State Prison&rsquo;s NAACP chapter  &mdash;  the only one of its kind in New England  &mdash;  has 70 members, many of them white, including the branch president, Ross said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State laws giving convicted felons the right to vote vary. About 5.3 million people nationwide are barred from voting because of criminal convictions, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>Only in Maine and Vermont are felons in state prisons allowed to cast ballots while serving their sentences. Those prisoners, however, still have to register to vote, something easier done on the outside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The effort now under way is the first time there&rsquo;s been a systemwide initiative to register inmates across an entire state, Ross said. Benjamin Jealous, national NAACP president, was on hand last week as volunteers registered inmates at five correctional centers.</p>

		<p>What I think is going on is that the NAACP has wanted felons (enhoosegowed, on probation or off probation) to have the vote for a long time.  But they know it&rsquo;ll go over like a lead balloon if they push it all at once, especially in black heavy or black significant states that have a lot of conservative whites.  So they&rsquo;re doing a trial run in a state that:  (1)  Has a very low prison population to begin with, and (2)  Is almost entirely lily-white in racial demographics such that blacks are a minority of its prison population, ergo whites are the majority.  (I&rsquo;m guessing off the top of my head that a state that is 90% white and 10% black would have a prison population that is 50/50.) and (3)  Whose whites are liberal/gullible/sucker enough to endorse the idea of enhoosegowed felons voting.  </p>
<p>The skids are better greased if the NAACP is able to sell the unwashed masses of white people that felons in prison should have the vote nationwide if the &ldquo;trial run&rdquo; among mostly white imprisoned felons in Maine seems to have no political consequence.  Maine is a fairly blue state, after all, and a few hundred extra Democrats won&rsquo;t flip ME from blue to red in 2012.  That might be enough to fool enough people in enough swing states with big enough prison populations to let imprisoned (and all other) felons vote, and their votes would flip the states from red to blue.  This could easily happen in OH, FL, MO and a few others.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about one thing and one thing ONLY:  Increasing the black voter base.</p>

&#8220;Many of Maines&rsquo; NAACP members are white, including the president&#8221;. </p>
<p>If this arrangement isn&rsquo;t an oxymoron I don&rsquo;t know what is. </p>
<p>Actually it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me though. White people in white states  like Maine take their favorable circumstances for granted. </p>
<p>I just wonder how many of these white NAACP members are originally from liberal flatlander states like Massachussetts or Connecticut??? </p>

		<p>I live in a &#8220;changing&#8221; nieghborhood of Chicago and was recently approached by a young Black with a clipboard.  He interupted a conversation I was having with a nieghbor to ask us to sign a petition to get some guy on the ballot for a judgeship.  My nieghbor asked what this guy running was about, what were his positions on things.  The only thing this guy could tell us was this would-be-judge wanted to change the laws to allow felons to vote.  I just rolled my eyes and said, &#8220;just what we need, a criminal voting block&#8221;.  Needless to say he didn&rsquo;t get any signatures from my nieghbor and I, but this movement to give felons the right to vote is happening all over and we need to be aware of it and make others aware.</p>

<p>Like I said in my little home on the internet, felonious whites have an incentive to join the NAACP.  If you lower the bar low enough, then everybody will be able to jump over it.  To put it another way, NAACP efforts to weaken the criminal justice system so that it doesn&rsquo;t net as many blacks also means that the net won&rsquo;t catch as many whites. </p>
<p>Though I think their calculus is flawed, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the radio station WVON 1690 AM?  I was at a fishing trip in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin during the long 4th of July weekend.  I bought my sensitive radio with me, and WVON barely makes it up to LG.  I listened to this one host and caller say the most silly things; I was rolling around on the lakeside dirt laughing so hard:</p>

		<p>This country has strayed so far from the wisdom of the Founding Fathers.  It is very unfortunate and sad.  They well understood a democracy can only survive when its people are intelligent and educated.  There are fundamental reasons why a person is behind bars.  Most of them are not educated and intelligent enough to vote!  Voting is not a fundamental right as expressed by the Founding Fathers.  It is a privilege.  This country and planet have suffered greatly from not having true leaders.  </p>

		<p>I like the part where the NAACP leader Rachel Ross denies they&rsquo;re doing this to help the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>ACORN does the same thing; they register large numbers of blacks and hispanics to vote while claiming to be nonpartisan.</p>

		<p>    Maine has a screw loose. The whole state is wacky. Just look at it&rsquo;s choice of senators, Collins and Snow. They are easily two of the dimmest bulbs in Washington. They are constantly manipulated by the demoncrats and the phony press. I recommend probationary status for Maine- for the foreseeable future.</p>

		<p>Of course to allow inmates to vote is a great idea. I wholeheartedly support it. <br>
It takes a real PRACTICAL care of the blacks in the USA.<br>
The idea stems from a smart prediction of the current well known tendency of the black to populate our prisons. <br>
If we don&rsquo;t allow our innocent inmates to vote, very soon we are going to run out of black voters.<br>
So I say:<br>
Let them ALL go to the prison and vote from there!<br>
Let the prisons ring, sorry: Let the prisons vote! </p>

		<p>The president of Maines&rsquo; racist group,the NAACP is white? What kind of idiot would promote anothers&rsquo; race over their own? Must be a guilty person with suicidal tendencies. That&rsquo;s fine but don&rsquo;t screw up every other (white) persons life with your wacky guilt ridden agenda. </p>

Charlie, that is not at all unusual!  If you look into the history of the NAACP, you will find that MOST of its presidents and benefactors have been non-black.  This is an old, old pattern.<br>

		<p>The next logical step would be to admit imprisoned black felons to jury duty. Nothing like having a jury of your peers. </p>
<p>Many are not aware of the relative ease with which some states allow paroled felons to regain their right to vote in state and local elections.  </p>
