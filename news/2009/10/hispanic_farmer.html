<h1><a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/64140512.html">Hispanic Farmers Deserve Justice</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial Board, San Antonio Express-News, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a decade ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture settled a class-action lawsuit brought by black farmers who had been denied loans because of their race. In addition to establishing a multi-billion settlement fund, the department acknowledged &#8220;indifference and blatant discrimination&#8221; against blacks in the department&rsquo;s lending programs over the course of decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In parts of the South and other areas of the country, FSA offices that diligently served the interests of white farmers routinely showed indifference to the needs of black farmers. In Texas and elsewhere, as Express-News staff writer Elaine Ayala reported, they also showed indifference to the needs of Mexican American farmers.</p>
<p>A group of 110 Hispanic farmers is suing the Agriculture Department for the same pattern of discrimination that resulted in a historic settlement with black farmers. However, unlike the black farmers, the Mexican American farmers have not been granted a class-action designation. That means the plaintiffs must file individual lawsuits.</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is reviewing one of those cases, Garcia vs. Vilsack. The court could finally grant the plaintiffs class-action status. It should.</p>
<p>However, a settlement doesn&rsquo;t need to wait on legal proceedings. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says he is committed to eradicating the department&rsquo;s discriminatory practices of the past, which he described as &#8220;a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land.&#8221;</p>
<p>If so, he could work with members of Congress to create a settlement with Mexican American farmers that models the settlement with black farmers. Thus far, Congress has shown little interest in the issue. It cries out for leadership from members of the Texas delegation.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a hard riddle to solve.  Hispanics want into the same successful racial hustle as blacks.</p>
<p>I suspect the supposed &#8220;discrimination&#8221; had something to do with white farmers being more efficient in their land use and production.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of hispanic farmers.  You can find them in your local State Forest growing pot in huge farms.  The recent fires in California are said to have been started by hispanic (drug) farmers up in the forest preserves.  I suppose these folks just want to be subsidized in their farming efforts, and the Gov will probably be stupid enough to give them federal funds to burn down our forests while &#8220;farming&#8221; cannibis.</p>

		<p>Sounds like black and hispanic farmers were denied loans due to bad credit. Obama&rsquo;s Orwellian flunky calls this &#8220;a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course had they succeeded in their demand for subprime loans they would now be working w/ACORN to sue over &#8220;racially motivated predatory lending&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Well from where I sit the solution seems simple enough&hellip;</p>
<p>Get rid of the Constitutionally dubious Agriculture Department&hellip;</p>
