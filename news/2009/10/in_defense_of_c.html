			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Taranto, Wall Street Journal, October 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Carol Swain is an apologist for white supremacists,&#8221; Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center tells the Tennessean. Carol Swain is also a friend of this column. To our mind the charge seemed awfully far-fetched, so we decided to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Swain, who is black, is a professor of law and political science at Vanderbilt University. She is an expert on white supremacists, having written a book on the subject, &#8220;The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration,&#8221; which was published in 2002 by Cambridge University Press and drew plaudits from scholars both liberal (Harvard&rsquo;s William Julius Wilson) and conservative (Princeton&rsquo;s Robert P. George).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The current kerfuffle involves an hourlong documentary film, &#8220;A Conversation on Race,&#8221; whose Web site prominently features a blurb from Swain: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Outstanding.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Meticulously done.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I highly recommend this film.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221; Deeper in the site is the full review, which is more qualified:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Web site, the filmmaker, Craig Bodeker, &#8220;redefines the conventional wisdom on Race and Racism&#8221; by asking &#8220;a diverse group of Colorado residents&#8221; questions about their attitudes toward and experiences of racism.</p>
<p>The SPLC strongly disapproves of the film. Sonia Scherr, in an Oct. 8 entry on the organization&rsquo;s Hatewatch blog, describes it as &#8220;a hit among white supremacists looking for a smart-sounding defense of their beliefs&#8221; and takes issue with several of the arguments Bodeker made in the film. In an Oct. 9 Hatewatch entry Scherr makes a case against the filmmaker. A reader discovered Bodeker&rsquo;s comments on various YouTube pages, which, Scherr writes, &#8220;expose him for the bigot he is&#8221;:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scherr provides several specific quotes, and readers in the Hatewatch comment section post screen shots to these and others. For the record, Bodeker, in a post on the Web site of the National Policy Institute (which describes itself as &#8220;the right&rsquo;s answer to the Southern Poverty Law Center&#8221; and is described by the SPLC as &#8220;a racist think tank&#8221; and by the Associated Press as &#8220;a white-advocacy group&#8221;), issued this response:<br>
<blockquote>[Scherr] relied upon an anonymous cyber-stalker to gather &#8220;quotes&#8221; attributed to me from the comments section of unrelated political videos from Youtube. She called this piece of journalism &#8220;A Peek Behind the Curtain: Views of a Racist Filmmaker .&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#8221;</p>
<p>Some pretty strong statements were quoted  &mdash;  as well as MIS-quoted, surgically and deceptively edited,, taken out of context, and even made up! And once again, these &#8220;quotes&#8221; that represent proof of my &#8220;racism,&#8221; were found on the comments section of Youtube.</p>
<p>Have any readers ever been to the comments section on Youtube? Does anyone NOT KNOW what a mosh-pitt of &#8220;free expression&#8221; it is? There are, sometimes, actual screaming matches, even though they&rsquo;re conducted in written form. Sometimes people say harsh, mean things there, in that last remaining refuge of Free Speech. Am I to assume that the SPLS&rsquo;s Sonia Scherr has never made a sarcastic comment? Or even a distasteful one? Or that anyone who EVER has should be stereotyped, marginalized and disenfranchised? This seems to be what the SPLC suggests.<br>
</blockquote>Bodeker does not disavow any specific quotes, and he acknowledges that some of them were accurate. No reasonable person can deny that the comments quoted were invidious. {snip}</p>
<p>Carol Swain wrote her review of &#8220;A Conversation on Race&#8221; in August, two months before Bodeker&rsquo;s YouTube comments surfaced. In a Puffington Host post on Oct. 12, Swain responded to the revelation:<br>
<blockquote>The racist comments attributed to Mr. Bodeker are ugly and vile. Would I have reviewed his film and given it a positive endorsement had I known more about his background? With the knowledge I have today, I would recommend the film be shown along with background information about Mr. Bodeker&rsquo;s hostility towards racial and ethnic minorities.<br>
</blockquote>Because we think highly of Swain, we decided to watch the film and draw our own conclusion. Our reaction was mixed: We found the interviews fascinating but Bodeker&rsquo;s narration disagreeable. We do, however, see Swain&rsquo;s point about the film&rsquo;s value in illuminating the subject of race in America.</p>
<p>In the interviews, with people who responded to a CraigsList ad, Bodeker makes a compelling case that much of what he calls the &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; about race consists of prejudice  &mdash;  not racial prejudice per se (although Bodeker attempts to frame it that way), but unthinking assumptions about the nature of American society and the racial attitudes of others.</p>
<p>Bodeker probes the interview subjects for contradictions, and finding them isn&rsquo;t hard. They agree that racism is pervasive, but are unable to give a clear definition of the term. He asks them to describe examples of racism in their own lives. They oblige  &mdash;  but their stories are ambiguous or innocuous. The most convincing anecdote turns out to be a case in which a white man describes overcoming his own prejudice. Lane, who looks to be around 40 and is originally from the South, describes a childhood episode in which a teacher warned him not to put his mouth on a water fountain because &#8220;black people do that.&#8221; Years later he was a lieutenant in the Army, and a black fellow officer had run out of water. Lane remembered his teacher&rsquo;s admonition and hesitated to share his canteen. The black officer, noticing Lane&rsquo;s discomfort, offered to drink from a cup. &#8220;I said, &#8216;No. You&rsquo;re my comrade in arms.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, the subjects readily answer in the affirmative when Bodeker asks them if blacks are better at basketball than whites. But when he asks why whites score better than blacks on standardized tests, they insist the tests are biased because they are written by whites. Then he asks why Asians do better than whites. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bodeker presents his interview subjects more sympathetically than he presents himself. Whereas they come across largely as good-natured but confused, he seems bitter and sarcastic. He makes clear that he nurses racial grievances  &mdash;  not necessarily against minorities but against social conventions that he sees as oppressive to whites.</p>
<p>He is angry about the imputation of historical guilt: &#8220;I can trace my earliest ancestors here in America to the 1870s, after our Civil War. No forefather of mine ever killed an Indian or owned another human being  &mdash;  ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also asserts that &#8220;America was founded as a white nation,&#8221; and that &#8220;her founding principles, which separate America from all other nations, were also developed by white men, not by a multicultural rainbow.&#8221; Actually, the founders were almost all British, and their principles drew heavily on British intellectual and legal traditions. But their claim was a universalist one: All men are created equal, not all Englishmen or colonists. In any case, how can Bodeker take racial pride in America&rsquo;s founding but deny racial guilt on the ground that his ancestors didn&rsquo;t arrive until a century later? To borrow one of his catch phrases, that&rsquo;s a large disconnect.</p>
<p>Bodeker seems to envy groups that enjoy an affirmative sense of identity: &#8220;Hispanics can be pro-Hispanic without being anti-anybody; Jews can be pro-Jewish without being anti-anybody; blacks can be pro-black without being anti-anybody. But with whites, it&rsquo;s different. White people cannot be pro-white without being anti-everybody-else.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a matter of historical contingency. We&rsquo;re hard-pressed to think of an example in American or European history in which the affirmation of a &#8220;white&#8221; identity, as distinct from a specific national, ethnic or religious identity, has meant anything other than being &#8220;anti-everybody-else.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>One segment of the film is inflammatory and invidious. After asking his interview subjects about race and crime, Bodeker cites federal statistics showing that the number of reported rapes involving a black perpetrator and a white victim is vastly higher than the number involving a white perpetrator and a black victim. He then says, &#8220;If selecting people for discrimination based on their skin color is racism, and it&rsquo;s a bad thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. isn&rsquo;t selecting people for rape because of their skin color also a bad thing? In fact, isn&rsquo;t it a much worse thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the film, while interesting, is seriously flawed. Yet its shortcomings as a persuasive vehicle may enhance its value as an object for study. Bodeker makes a strong case that politically correct orthodoxy on race is vacuous, but by openly displaying his own resentments and prejudices, he shows that rejecting that orthodoxy does not necessarily yield a more enlightened and sensible view. {snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;But their (Founders)claim was a universalist one: All men are created equal, not all Englishmen or colonists.&#8221; WRONG, WSJ! If there has ever been a quote more dishonestly defined by Liberals I don&rsquo;t know of it. Any student and/or expert of Jefferson (who penned this sentence)who is worth their weight knows full well that Jefferson (and the Founders) were NOT speaking in a &#8220;universalist&#8221; manner but ABSOLUTELY were referring to Europeans (Whites) in general and &#8220;Englishmen&#8221; in particular.  A quick perusal of Jefferson&rsquo;s writings show that he was as far from being a racial &#8220;universalist&#8221; as Mississippi is to the moon.</p>

<p>It may have SOUNDED universalist, but it clearly applied only to a limited subset of humanity. Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t have also believed in slavery (which many did) and/or racial inequality (which basically all of them did).</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;In any case, how can Bodeker take racial pride in America&rsquo;s founding but deny racial guilt on the ground that his ancestors didn&rsquo;t arrive until a century later? To borrow one of his catch phrases, that&rsquo;s a large disconnect.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very good point. The same can be said not only for Bodeker, but also for the vast majority of &#8216;whites&rsquo; in the US. Most whites are not descended from the founding stock&hellip;</p>

		<p>It looks to me like the SPLC has scored a big victory, and its revelations about Boedeker&rsquo;s intemperate language at Youtube will be used by the media to destroy any chance that &#8220;A Conversation About Race&#8221; had of helping to bring realism to the national discourse on race.  Boedeker&rsquo;s complaint that his &#8220;mosh pit&#8221; type language should be overlooked by the mainstream media is fatuous whining.  He should have known he would be given a minute rectal examination (for however long it took the SPLC to find this stuff) and held to a far higher standard than the Jesse Jacksons.</p>
<p>Boedeker had a real chance of doing something for white people, but he blew it, and will now be safely buried by white race traitors like Tarantino, who are undoubtedly breathing a sigh of relief.  </p>

		<p>So basically, in pointing out flaws in the film makers attitude, the Wall Street Journal is saying two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right. Where was the WSJ before Bodeker made this film? Certainly not sending out their reporters to investigate the white side of the racial conversation or to speak with disaffected whites. </p>

		<p>I must say that I&rsquo;m disappointed in Mr Bodecker if he has made any deliberately offensive remarks towards or about minorities, as he doesn&rsquo;t seem the type to engage in that rather trite behaviour. However without knowing the context of such remarks we cannot afford to be judgemental, whilst the SPLC are a far from reliable source.</p>

		<p>What is the problem with Craig&rsquo;s comment that America was founded as a White nation? He is RIGHT! When they talked about all men being equal they meant it for the White race, not the universalist multi crowd! They never dreamed that America would become the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; of different races, cultures and religions that now comprise the new America.  Oh, and what is wrong with having prejudices and resentments of other races? They sure do have them against the Whites, but we are not allowed the same privilege? There wouldn&rsquo;t be all this racial strife in the first place if America had stayed White (the different White Euro peoples) like it was meant to be. The traitors and enemies of our race are the ones that are the real haters so let us get that clear!</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that just because Mr. Boedeker is European he cannot dissassociate himself from those who owned slaves. Just because he is a European and states that America was founded by Europeans and he relates to those individuals then he must shoulder all of the guilt for slavery and every other social maladay of the day. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact the statistics that he quotes about black on white rape are that statistics and nothing more. Why is it wrong to bring them up. They happen with much, much more frequency<br>
 than any of the bogus hate crimes or social injustices that supposedly happend 50 years ago. </p>
<p>As far as being anti everybody else all groups black, brown and white seek out their own mutual benefit as a group. Just listen to the blacks talk about hispanics in the CD to a man/woman they say they need to send them (hispanics) back to Mexico. </p>

		<p>Years ago there was an episode of the Twlight Zone about a man obsessed with finding and exposing communists.  He was constantly calling businesses and newspapers claming that certain individuals were communists and demanding they be fired and publicly denounced. He was, of course, portrayed as a pathetic and evil person.  They should do an updated version of the episode.  In the new version the nutcase would devote his life to seeking out &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of all the problems that threaten our society, &#8220;white supremacism&#8221; ranks right up there with communism. </p>

		<p>Since we&rsquo;re on the topic of Bodeker&rsquo;s video, I wanted to comment on the following episode, described in this article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lane, who looks to be around 40&hellip;and a black fellow officer had run out of water. Lane remembered his teacher&rsquo;s admonition and hesitated to share his canteen. The black officer, noticing Lane&rsquo;s discomfort, offered to drink from a cup. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;No. You&rsquo;re my comrade in arms.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first question that came to my mind, when viewing the video and coming to that narrative, was &#8220;how is it that the black ran out of water while the white retained some of his?&#8221;  Most likely this is illustrative of the typical lack of planning blacks make for the future.  The black soldier drank as much of his water as he wanted and then found himself dry later on.  The white rationed his usage and saved some for later.  Typically, the black then availed himself of &#8220;welfare&#8221; from the white - who would have been &#8220;racist&#8221; had he not obliged.</p>
<p>Back to the article.  None of his objections to the video make any sense.  For example:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a matter of historical contingency. We&rsquo;re hard-pressed to think of an example in American or European history in which the affirmation of a &ldquo;white&rdquo; identity, as distinct from a specific national, ethnic or religious identity, has meant anything other than being &ldquo;anti-everybody-else.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is because of hate groups, such as the SPLC, branding any and all white advocacy groups &#8220;racist&#8221;.  The author is &#8220;hard-pressed&#8221; only because of his own bias and ignorance.  There are plenty, at Amren, who consider themselves &#8220;white&#8221; and are not haters of other groups.  The same could be said for the COCC and EAIF.</p>
<p>The author brings up Bodeker&rsquo;s citing of rape statistics and calls is invidious.  That&rsquo;s it.  That is the sum of his argument.  Bodeker is not lying.  He is not misrepresenting the facts.  He is not even mistaken.  No.  He&rsquo;s &#8220;invidious&#8221; and, in the eyes of this writer, that&rsquo;s enough reason to disregard those statistics.  By the same token, let us disregard the slavery of blacks in the U.S. as meaningless; after all, that would be &#8220;invidious&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more but this post is already too long.</p>

		<p>For everybody&rsquo;s information, the Tennessean newspaper out of Nashville has become something of a state joke.  They alienate their readership by interviewing such people as the SPLC crowd.  The Atlanta Journal has the same problem.  This does not speak well for the SPLC as their audience keeps shrinking and shrinking. No one expects the Journal to last much longer.  I have relatives in Nashville and they tell me  the Tennessean is on the brink as well.  There is always SOME good news.</p>

All white men.  It wasn&rsquo;t written down because everyone took it for granted.</p>

Let&rsquo;s pretend for a second that he&rsquo;s right(he isn&rsquo;t) and that all past white white groups have been hateful evil racist groups bent on racial genocide.  Does that mean that current whites should be demonized for something whites in the past did?  Because that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>As for the rape comment, they aren&rsquo;t listed as hate crimes because no crime against whites by blacks ever is.  </p>

<p>This is a deeply ignorant opinion for many reasons. The writer is unaware of research showing the biology of whites makes us the least racist of any people. The writer doesn&rsquo;t know about sociology theories which show the relationship between citizens and the government is highly complex in the modern world. Problems between whites and non-whites in modern western countries cannot be compared with the miriad ethnic/racial problems around the world. The writer simply assumes that as whites lose power the non-white groups will not behave racially; there is no basis for this assumption. The writer displays a conceit that people don&rsquo;t need an ethnic identity which is condescending toward non-white ethnic groups and denies whites an essential element of identity. The writer seems to be unaware that foreign countries are developing ties and sharing resources with fellow ethnics in whites countries; he might ask himself what are whites going to do without our own homelands. I could go on but his breezy dismissal of white interests is appalling in its conceit and ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a matter of historical contingency. We&rsquo;re hard-pressed to think of an example in American or European history in which the affirmation of a &ldquo;white&rdquo; identity, as distinct from a specific national, ethnic or religious identity, has meant anything other than being &ldquo;anti-everybody-else.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>All the more reason to make one?</p>

		<p>This is a pretty fair assessment of Bodeker&rsquo;s film. </p>
<p>Although I do find it rather strange that a writer for the WALL STREET JOURNAL was unable to recognize RATIONAL SELF-INTERESTED BEHAVIOR even after staring at it for an hour. </p>
<p>His muddled defense of the status quo at the end of the article was pretty strange too.  </p>

<p>I see the WSJ plays the usual media game.  I must be anti-everybody-else if I am proud of the overwhelming accomplishments of European derived people, and opposed to the unrelenting anti-white policies of our government, universities, media, and corporations.  And the truth is that many of those pro-black or pro-Hispanic organizations and individuals do favor their race over all others, and want special privileges.  That is what affirmative action is.<br>

		<p>Taranto and his WSJ editors have proven that they reside over a new Dark Age, a new era of extreme intellectual bondage: How can anyone miss the screaming irony of these two gems?<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
&#8220;One segment of the film is inflammatory and invidious. After asking his interview subjects about race and crime, Bodeker cites federal statistics showing that the number of reported rapes involving a black perpetrator and a white victim is vastly higher than the number involving a white perpetrator and a black victim.&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
So, to point out the TRUTH-the SIMPLE, UNCONTESTED TRUTH, no less, is &#8220;inflammatory and invidious&#8221;? Taranto, et al, may be inflamed by a statement that the sun will rise tomorrow in the east, but their defensive indignation will not stop the sun from rising, will it? It is no less the truth, regardless of the feelings of the easily offended, or the cowards of the world.</p>
<p>And, the coupe de grace:<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
&#8220;So the film, while interesting, is seriously flawed. Yet its shortcomings as a persuasive vehicle may enhance its value as an object for study. Bodeker makes a strong case that politically correct orthodoxy on race is vacuous, but by openly displaying his own resentments and prejudices, he shows that rejecting that orthodoxy does not necessarily yield a more enlightened and sensible view.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Seriously, this must be a joke. This is beyond irony. The WSJ flippantly dismisses the film, based on&hellip;what? Then, they state that  politically correct orthodoxy is vacuous. HUH? The WSJ just made the most vacuous, and politically correct concessions possible- dismissing a film and an argument they actually admitted made sense.<br>
This is a bizzare age. Is this a joke?</p>

		<p>Wow, on a full read of the WSJ article, it seems as though it came from a chamber of religious inquisitors&hellip;passing judgement on every comment made by the film&rsquo;s writer, and the interviewed subjects. Every word analyzed for breeches of OTRHODOXY. Call it political, call it religious (which, really, it is), or call it cultural, the WSJ is acting as if this is all really a trial&hellip;and EVERYBODY is the defendant. Let no phrase, defense, assertion, or thought, go unexamined. All shall kneel to the almighty law of diversity. Let us  all denounce every word that flirts with questioning!<br>
Sick, and scary. Or maybe just groveling to keep on the good side of the advertisers. Maybe it&rsquo;s all about money. At least that&rsquo;s rational!</p>

<p>No, this is a matter of a racial contingency.</p>
<p>No hordes are DEMANDING to live among Mexicans.</p>

<p>Whites are not anti-everybody-else. Everybody ELSE simply loves whites more than their own.</p>
<p>When whites say, &#8220;only a few of you may live among us&#8221; it reminds THEM of why THEY don&rsquo;t want to live among their own.</p>

		<p>When the founders talked about equality of men, they were talking a moral equality in the eyes of the law, voting, etc.  They didn&rsquo;t refer to ability, behavior, talents, height, weight, etc.  This should be obvious, but this seemed lost on the WSJ.</p>
<p>When Bodecker pointed out that the country was founded by white men, he was pointing out that other ethnic groups would not necessarily have endorsed the same principles of democracy, right to free speech, capitalism, etc.  Just look around the world and you will see this.  </p>

		<p>Bodecker&rsquo;s remarks at YouTube were in fact hateful, and if someone was saying the same things about whites, we would all point this out.  I also agree that he made a very provocative, thoughtful and effective film.   </p>
<p>But while I originally thought that his hateful and stupid YouTube comments would serve to keep him in the white nationalist ghetto instead of allowing him to get his message out more broadly, I now realize the opposite is almost certainly the case:  the WSJ in all likelihood would NEVER have paid any attention to him and his film, would never have reviewed it, if he had not made those comments.  They only paid attention when they found this other stuff he said that, unlike his film, was indefensible.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy mixed-up world we live in.  </p>

<p>Critically important point.  Does anyone know what X is (and perhaps some better language) in a sentence along the lines:</p>
<p>Of all the immigration in the world day, X% of it is non-whites (non-Hispanic non-Arab) moving to a country that is predominantly white.<br>

<p>lol - yes, even the idea someone might be thinking a pro-white thought is something the reporter must expose and rail against. Where is he when the non-whites, indeed our entire society, seems obsessed with being pro-black, yellow, brown -diversity and, they aren&rsquo;t just thinking about it, these aren&rsquo;t just potentially nasty thoughts, they&rsquo;re busy enshrining their pride and activisim into law and tradition for real. If you ask me, maybe this reporter thought he was being open minded and balanced, but perhaps he&rsquo;s only contributing to the problem. </p>

		<p>The passage of the 1965 immigration reform act has completetly screwed everything up in this country. If it had not been passed, Whites and Blacks would have worked towards a peacefull resolution. Now we have millions of high fertility hispanics,asians,post-1965 africans and carribeans competing for the scarce resources of America with Native Born White Americans. And do not pretend that the resources of America are not scarce. The case for affirnmative action is built upon this fact.</p>
<p>In 2010, the US population is exploding. 100 % of this population growth is caused by post-1965 high fertility,hispanics,asians,muslims,carribeans and africans. &#8220;Environmentalist&#8221; think that this is blessing from the Earth Godess.</p>
<p>The rapid growing high fertility hispanic,asian,muslim and african population want to stick it to whitey. Native Born White Americans will retaliate by increasing their fertility. And amesty will be passed-and as a consequence&hellip;. the US population in as little as three decades, will shoot pass the one billion mark-with no end in site. It is inevitable that human civilization will collapse within the borders of America.</p>
<p>What I have just written is the most likely scenario for America&rsquo;s future. Only a White Nationalist political movement can save White America. No other kind of &#8220;America&#8221; is viable.</p>
<p>Liberals,Leftist-Alexander Cockburn types-and free market conservatives are repsonsible for all of this. They are the lowest of life forms on this planet.</p>
