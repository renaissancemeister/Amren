<h1>The Silent Catastrophe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, Taki&rsquo;s Magazine, October 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his famous speech of April 20, 1968, the British statesman Enoch Powell said, &#8220;The discussion of future grave but, with effort now, avoidable evils is the most unpopular and at the same time the most necessary occupation for the politician.&#8221;</p>
<p>One great, avoidable evil we face is the declining quality of the American work force.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau tells us that if immigration continues at its current rate of nearly two million people a year, whites will become a minority of the under-18 child population in just 14 years  &mdash;  in 2023  &mdash;  and will become a minority of the working population just 16 years later. The greatest increase will be in Hispanics, who are now dropping out of high school at higher rates than blacks, doing little better than blacks when they manage to stay in school, and are the group least likely to go to college. Demographers are beginning to warn that as well-educated, white baby boomers retire and are replaced by poorly educated blacks and Hispanics, the productivity gains of the last several hundred years will be reversed, and the United States could go into a tailspin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here are some of the facts. In 2007, 93.5 percent of white and 93.1 percent of Asian 18- to 24-year-olds had graduated from high school. The figures for blacks and Hispanics were 88.8 percent and 72.7 percent, meaning that Hispanics were more than four times more likely than whites and 2.4 times more likely than blacks to have failed to graduate from high school.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for immigrants is adjusting to the U.S.; Hispanics born here are more likely to finish high school than those who immigrate as children. However, the graduation rate slightly decreases for the second U.S.-born generation (85.1 percent vs. 85.9 percent), so that in 2007, even after three generations in the United States, Hispanics had a dropout rate that was still 2.3 times the white rate and 33 percent higher than the black rate.</p>
<p>Big-city public school districts, which are heavily black and Hispanic, have appalling records. In Detroit, only 26.8 percent of students graduated on time in 2006. The other worst performers were Philadelphia: 39.1 percent, Dallas: 40.7 percent, Los Angeles: 47.7 percent, and Washington, DC: 48.8 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics who stay in school do badly. In 2007, their fourth-grade performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading test was the same as blacks: already two years behind whites and Asians. By 12th grade, the average black or Hispanic is reading and doing math at the level of the average white 8th-grader.</p>
<p>Hispanics are the least likely group to go to college. In 2003, 28 percent of Hispanics aged 18 to 24 were enrolled in college, compared to 38 percent of blacks and 52 percent of whites. Most groups have been increasing their college attendance rates, but between 1974 and 2003, rates for Hispanic men declined. Again, the problem is not just one of adapting to the United States. College graduation rates for U.S.-born Hispanics are only slightly better than those for immigrants, and Hispanics who have been in the country for three generations or more are still less likely even than blacks to graduate from college.</p>
<p>In recent times, the American workforce has been the best educated in the world: 85 percent of adult Americans are high school graduates, up from just 25 percent in 1940. Twenty-eight percent have a college degree, a fivefold increase since 1940. Better education helped raise real average per capita income in the United States 40 percent between 1980 and 2000.</p>
<p>This rise in income will reverse as black, Hispanic, and immigrant workers replace whites. California will be particularly hard hit because of its large Hispanic population. By 2009, 50 percent of its public school students were Hispanic, as were nearly three quarters of the 700,000 children in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Two-thirds of kindergarteners were Hispanic and many could not speak English.</p>
<p>According to a 2007 report from the Migration Policy Institute, an estimated 400,000 legal immigrants and 350,000 illegal immigrants were illiterate in their native languages, much less English. This contributed to the first decline in literacy in California&rsquo;s history. In 2003, its adult illiteracy rate of 23 percent  &mdash;  up 50 percent in 10 years  &mdash;  put it last among all states.</p>
<p>The California Dropout Research Project at UC Santa Barbara estimated in 2009 that because high school dropouts commit more crime than students who stay in school, dropouts cost California $1.1 billion annually in law enforcement costs and victim damages while they are still minors. This estimate did not include lost productivity costs as adults or continuing public outlays for adult criminals and indigents.</p>
<p>The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education predicts that because of declining education and productivity, average per capita income for the nation will have fallen two percent by 2020. For California, because of its heavily Hispanic population, the center predicted a real per capita income decline of $2,467 or no less than 10.8 percent, the biggest loss for any state. &#8220;For the U.S. economy, the implication of these trends is really stark,&#8221; said Patrick Callan, president of the center.</p>
<p>Texas faces serious problems, too. State demographer Steve H. Murdock notes that if immigration continues, the Texas public schools will be 80 percent minority by 2040, up from 57 percent in 2000. He calculates that if black and Hispanic graduation rates do not improve, by 2040 Texans will see real, average per capita income fall by $6,500. Mr. Murdock warns of a surge in crime, poverty, and every other social problem.</p>
<p>McKenzie and Company estimates that if black and Hispanic students had been able to close the achievement gap in 1998, American GDP 10 years later would have been larger by up to half-a-trillion dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. is slipping badly in comparison with other developed countries. ETS has also analyzed the results of the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), which tests the math and verbal abilities of adults in the 20 richest countries. The United States ranked 12th out of 20 in both math and reading; Australia and Belgium are among the countries that score better than we do. ETS&rsquo;s most eye-opening conclusions, however, come from breaking out the scores of different groups.</p>
<p>If blacks, Hispanics, and immigrants are excluded from the American results, our performance rises from 12th, to 2nd in reading and 5th in math. This means immigrants, blacks, and Hispanics are dragging our rating down to 12th from 2nd and 5th. Likewise, the oldest Americans (56 and older) came in second in reading whereas younger Americans, those 26-35 and 16-25 years old, ranked 11th and 14th, respectively. The oldest age groups  &mdash;  the ones with the most whites  &mdash;  do the best while the youngest groups with the fewest whites to worst. The ETS also found that native-born blacks and Hispanics performed at only the 28th percentile, compared to other rich countries, and immigrants at only the 17th percentile.</p>
<p>The same racial pattern is found in student scores. The Program for International Student Assessment is run by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Every three years it tests the academic abilities of 15-year-olds in many different countries, and American scores have been declining steadily. In 2006, the United States ranked 29th on the science/math ability scale, lagging behind Latvia and Croatia. However, if the scores only of whites were counted, the U.S. ranked 10th, in the company of Japan, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. Hispanics-only scores fall to 40th, and blacks-only scores to 50th, just ahead of Indonesia. American scores are worse than they seem. By age 15, many of the worst performing American students have dropped out, which means those who are tested are not a representative sample.</p>
<p>Many Americans have criticized companies for moving white-collar jobs overseas because labor is cheaper. In coming decades, companies may move them offshore because they can&rsquo;t find Americans who can do them at any wage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lagging non-white achievement is such a preoccupation that in 2007, 4,000 educators and experts attended an &#8220;Achievement Gap Summit&#8221; held in Sacramento. They attended no fewer than 125 panels on how to help blacks and Hispanics do as well as whites and Asians. There are about 16,000 school districts in the United States, and not one has figured out how to do that  &mdash;  but we all keep pretending it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Re-segregation,&#8221; a favorite liberal bugaboo, is also manifestly not the cause of our current woes. Blacks and Hispanics score in equivalent ranges, whether they account for fewer than five percent of a state&rsquo;s student population or more than 20 percent. The states with the highest overall student scores have racial gaps that are equal to or even wider than states with lower overall scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Great Chinese Encyclopedia, edition of 2039, will, no doubt, have a thoughtful article entitled &#8220;The Decline of the West.&#8221; By then, the white man&rsquo;s downfall will be obvious to everyone, but the reasons for it will baffle even the best Chinese minds. The article will conclude, with a shrug, that Occidentals are inscrutable.<br>

		<p>As someone who is over 40 I&rsquo;m astonished about how rapidly we&rsquo;ve declined as a nation in just the past few decades.  We went from a vibrant Western culture, a financial powerhouse and a world leader in almost every sector of industry and we transitioned into a bankrupt, afro-Mexicanized, 2nd world nation which by 2050 will probably move into 3rd world status.  There is no way in the world our heavily minority workforce will ever compete toe to toe with the European Union, China, Russia or any other player on the world stage.  If we want our nation to survive we have to muster the courage to jettison these aliens from our shores and clamp down on the black population via segregation and the elimination of affirmative action and quotas.  We need to enforce some real educational standards and stop looking for creative ways to build self-esteem in minority children.  I don&rsquo;t want my son who&rsquo;s gifted in mathematics to sit next to Koolaidisha who is also considered a prodigy because she can rap and rhyme and make raspberry noises (the school calls it poetry). If children can&rsquo;t make the cut in school some kind of alternative needs to be found like putting them all in the same school or just letting them drop out.  Our public schools are a joke and amount to nothing more than free child care or holding pens for minorities.</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor&rsquo;s article talks about the abysmal decline of America in the coming decades. Unless you&rsquo;re 60 years or older, most of us will live to see the coming catastrophe written above  &mdash;  and if things in America will be that bad during our lifetime, just think of how much more dreadful America will be for our children, our grandchildren and all subsequent generations.</p>
<p>We all know about the phenomenon of white flight: whites fleeing to the suburbs to escape the inner cities, which declined considerably because of the high non-white population. Well, in the future I believe we will see another type of white flight in which whites will flee from the country entirely.</p>
<p>This particular white flight - whites emmigrating to another country - has already taken place on a large scale in South Africa.</p>
<p>I did a search on google for white flight in South Africa and discovered this article from NewsWeek:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/184783" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/id/184783</a></p>
<p>Here is a quote from the article: &#8220;Some 800,000 out of a total white population of 4 million have left since 1995, by one count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly 1 in 4 white South Africans have emmigrated since the blacks took over.</p>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;re the majority there is widespread racism against us, such as discrimination against us in hiring and college acceptance, plus we&rsquo;re always blamed for the failures of blacks. And when we no longer have control over our country and become the minority, think of how much worse things will be for us. And add the third-worldization of our country due to the new majority&rsquo;s disinterest in education and success, which was described extensively in the above article, and what you have is a recipe for complete and utter disaster.</p>
<p>As for myself, I have thought a lot about leaving America and emmigrating to a country in Europe so that I can have the peace of mind in knowing that me and my descendants will not suffer the same fate as white South Africans. The only issue is that in Europe multiculturalism and racial political correctness also exists. In fact, the wikipedia article for &#8220;Islam in Europe&#8221; says that by the year 2050, Muslims will comprise 1 out of 5 people living in Europe. But at least there are many popular and increasingly growing right-wing parties in Europe taking a stand against the genocide of our race  &mdash;  in America there is no popular organized effort to stop the genocide of our race. The only thing we&rsquo;re allowed to oppose in America is illegal immigration  &mdash;  anyone who opposes legal immigration, which will still lead to our racial dispossession, is called every name under the sun.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know where to go. The future looks abysmal in every Western country. I just want to live in a place that is safe for me and my descendants and where we will not be dispossessed and made minorities in our own country.</p>

<p>Jared Taylor has a knack for boiling down an absurdity to its essence and thereby revealing how nutty it is! </p>
<p>If disproportionate achievement were man-made, how could it function as consistently as the law of gravity? Of course the only possible answer is that, just as the law of gravity is a natural function, so is disproportionate achievement. There is no man-made system that functions with 100% efficiency   &mdash;   or inefficiency as the case may be. Therefore, the disproportionate achievement of the races must be a natural phenomenon, not a man-made one. No other explanation is possible.</p>

<p><i>If blacks, Hispanics, and immigrants are excluded from the American results, our performance rises from 12th, to 2nd in reading and 5th in math.</i></p>
<p>I always wondered before discovering AmRen how the US, as a superpower, could have fallen from its position of leadership so quickly. How could the educational system, the criminal justice system, the urban infrastructure and so many other things have collapsed so quickly compared to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Now I know the answer.</p>

<p>Respectfully disagree, Mr. Taylor.  The ethnically homogeneous Chinese superstate will not only recognize the reason for the decline of the West, but will emphasize it to their own population to defend against liberalism and multicultural sentiments on the home front.</p>

		<p>  Inscrutable indeed, despite all of these irrefutable, set in stone facts, liberals in both parties keep demanding more of the same . Let&rsquo;s just keep going down the same old road we&rsquo;ve been on since 1965 to our own self destruction . All of these demographic changes, our change from an industrial manufacturing economy to a so called, &#8220;service oriented,&#8221; economy they have been predicting since the mid sixties . They didn&rsquo;t just happen, they were made to happen . But why ? I saw a young lady on TV, she said &#8220;don&rsquo;t blame the immigrants, blame your personal computer.&#8221; Why ? Any civilized nation has to have manfactured goods, computers are nice but they are not required . Look at the manufacturing records set during and right after WW2 . There wasn&rsquo;t a computer to be found, either at home or at the plants . No, blaming the personal computer for our current economic woes seem to me to be just a diversionary tactic of some kind for some unclear reason . This is more like a conspiracy, but again-why ? </p>

		<p>How can this country say more and more immigrants are needed, so in order to be indoctrinated in our education centers, with the goal of competing against &#8220;the rest of the world&#8221;? Don&rsquo;t they realize that it&rsquo;s a vicious cycle- dumbed-down education standards cannot possibly hope to uplift uneducated mestizos, Africans, non-Oriental Asians and Pacific Islanders. Then they wonder why standards are lagging?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, what exactly are we competing with the other nations of the world for? Military supremacy? To see who can export more jobs to 3rd World backwaters? World Cup soccer? To impose our will on the rest of the world? To shove our culture down the throats of other countries?</p>
<p>When Armageddon comes, it won&rsquo;t matter anyway.  </p>

		<p>Great article, but unfortunately valid arguments backed up with hard data don&rsquo;t really get you anywhere anymore. It really is sad.</p>
<p>But hey, maybe I can cheer you guys up with some good news. Today, my fiancee finally became &#8216;one of us&rsquo;. She had an epiphany when driving past her old middle school and only seeing one (1) white kid among the teeming hordes. I never wanted to push her toward any of this, because it really is dangerous to hold the opinions that we AmRen readers espouse. Needless to say, though, I&rsquo;m overjoyed that she came around by herself. I picked a good one!</p>

		<p>The productivity question that Dr. Taylor addresses is new in terms of receiving any real scrutiny.  But I suspect that there&rsquo;s a much bigger consequence of black and Hispanic proliferation than average levels of national productivity.</p>
<p>I suspect that any reduction in national industrial and economic productivity will be much less than Dr. Taylor foresees, since most forms of productivity are less labor intensive, and growing more-so every day, than before. They&rsquo;re increasingly intellectual in nature.  This will leave blacks and Hispanics ever further behind in what will become a growing class of the chronically unemployed and unemployable.</p>
<p>This will have social consequences far graver than any reduction in national GDP.</p>
<p>Great innovation has always been the province of the intellectually elite, who will always exist.  But the lower end of the bell-curve, rather than shrinking, frighteningly, is growing as never before in America.  A friend of mine once noted that what we&rsquo;re doing, with uncontrolled immigration and social support mechanisms for fast-breeding blacks and Hispanics, is tantamount to fertilizing and watering weeds in a once-lush garden. </p>

		<p>There is a &#8220;bright&#8221; side to this one.  Racially-conscious whites see it, fear it, are outraged by it, and are preparing for it.  The lesser intelligent of our own (meaning no instinct to survive) do not and will suffer the consequences.  Look at it this way, it&rsquo;s nature way of culling the weak from the herd.<br>

		<p>Not only have the secular Whites worldwide been dumbed down for a reason, just look at what they have done to White Christians. Talk about a disaster waiting to happen. Revised Christianity (on purpose)is nothing but the desire to make Whites feel obligated to practice altruism onto the nonwhites of the world or God will &#8220;punish&#8221; them&hellip;what a joke. They don&rsquo;t even read their Bible let alone understand that altruism was meant for their own kind (race)!!</p>

<p>@16 You are wrong, Eastern Europe is still nationalistic and race conscious and Russia is the most nationalistic of them all.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget UK was fighting against Russia to help the Ottoman Empire while Russia helped Eastern Europe(Balkans) against the muslims.</p>
<p>Also America and UK bombed Serbia to help create another muslim state Kosovo besides Bosnia.</p>
<p>Now there are ZERO MOSQUES in Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Ukraine and THOUSANDS in UK and France.</p>
<p>When the time comes we reserve our right to accept you or not in our WHITE CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES because we remember that you were OUR ENEMIES.</p>
<p>Good luck with your multicultural heavens.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The ethnically homogeneous Chinese superstate will not only recognize the reason for the decline of the West, but will emphasize it to their own population to defend against liberalism and multicultural sentiments on the home front&#8221;.</p>
<p>I agree with that. To a certain degree, the victories browns in what used to be Western civilizations will also turn against or correct some of the ridiculous attitudes of the multicultists. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Many Americans have criticized companies for moving white-collar jobs overseas because labor is cheaper. In coming decades, companies may move them offshore because they can&rsquo;t find Americans who can do them at any wage.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means tens of millions more unemployed (on top of the already dismal unemployment figures). What happens when you get so many unemployed people with no way to feed themselves together in one place? Riots, that&rsquo;s what. Expect riots.</p>

		<p>To John Bell: does not matter if whites under 4s are a minority now (maybe they are not). In 14 years there will be 14 years of additional births. So, the point is that over the next 14 years, when looking at birth rates, one estimates that non-whites will be the majority under 18.  Non-whites are increasing at a faster rate than whites, so the cumulative effect will be to overtake the whites.</p>
<p>The majority population of this country will be ignorant and low skilled, mooching off a small core of productive people. The future truly is that of an elite and an underclass with a very small middle class. This is the structure of many _developing_ countries.</p>
<p>There is nothing to fight for. Its over. Demographic realities cannot be fought. A minority does not rule over a majority except through undemocratic means. Are you really prepared for that ?  Better to let America die. </p>
<p>Whites need to network now, plan for the time when separation/escape is the only option and in the process practice smart asset protection, as the productive will be squeezed to pay for the minorities&rsquo; health and welfare.</p>
<p>Build your assets, pick one or two escape countries, and start to build relationships there, etc.</p>

<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;re trying to avoid having to carefully pick quota&rsquo;s of different races; in China, they can just pick the most talented people without regard to race. No need for X numnber of blacks, or hispanics or whatever. No fear of race based lawsuits either.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #1, very well said. Absolutely on target.  I too, am stunned by the degeneration in just the past two decades of the America I knew. Public schools are becoming the lawful daycare/holding pens of children of all races who are not being raised; but rather, just growing up. In so-called public schools, learning is secondary to just keeping violence to a tolerable minimum. Too many sperm/egg donors (I refuse to call them parents) assume public schools should educate their children in every possible way, not just academic standards.</p>

		<p>As poster number 4 wrote, I have also entertained the idea of falling back to the ancestreal homeland of Europe, for the same reasons. It&rsquo;s a lovely thought to live among an extended kin ingroup, in an explicitly White nation. I&rsquo;m fortunate to be skilled in a trade that makes relocation a matter of choice rather than a possibility. </p>
<p>In August of 08, I made my choice to spend a month in Europe to test the water, and I&rsquo;ve been here ever since. I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in Denmark for about 8 months, and have since Resided in Croatia since last March. Its realy nice here, Both countries I&rsquo;ve resided in are overwhelmingly White, peaceful, and have a pretty good ethnic identity. </p>
<p>A 45 minute flight from Zagreb to the north of me will land me in Munich. When in Denmark, about the same time on a flight south from Aalborg would land me in Berlin. Both of these cities are visible indicators that White America&rsquo;s problems are NOT unique to her shores, but effect the entire White world community. Right now, I sit in a White paradise, and I&rsquo;m comfortable. I enjoy watching the faces walk by me as I have a coffee with my wife in one of the many street cafes here, and see only beautiful White people. Yet, not very far from me, and on European soil, the faces are not what I would expect to see in places like Germany, or France, or The Netherlands, or the Uk, and many I can&rsquo;t see at all through the burka they wear. Very many areas in Europe, are hostile to ethnic Europeans, and resemle more the middle east than Europe. Even when I visit friends in Copenhagen, the city resembles an alien nation in many parts. God forbid that you travel to Malmo Sweeden, just across the bridge from Copenhagen, it&rsquo;s very hard to spot the Scandinavian faces among the teaming mass of immigrants. </p>
<p>I realy enjoy the area of Europe where I live now, but I agree with poster 16, and beacuse so, I dont plan on staying here past next summer. America is unique in so many ways, and worth fighting for. It&rsquo;s also vastly more capable than the enemies of White America give us credit for. 200 million strong, and truly the cream of the crop of European genetics. I honestly believe that a perfect storm is brewing on the horizon, and it will blow in a great American Renaissance of explicit White reaction to displacement. As poster 16 said, there will be no place left to run to if we dont hold fast now. White homelands across the globe are ALL in the crosshairs of the Multicults, and they are gaining ground on the remaining areas. </p>
<p>The Jews had a policy in effect in Jerusalem before war broke out in &#8216;49, which strikes me as relevant to this situation, and it was &#8220;not an inch!&#8221; Every Jewish family was emplored to hold the ground they had at all costs, even in hostile Arab neighborhoods. This militant and successful refusal to displacement led to the birth of a nation. I admire them for thier tenacity, and I wish more Whites would look to thier example, for there are many lessons to learn from them. But untill we hold our own ground, develop an explicit White Identity, and fight for our intersts as a distinct people, we more closely resemble Bosniaks being ethnicly cleansed from their historic homelands,than a proud people who built Western Civilization. If we dont fight for what we have now, there will be nowhere for any of us to fall back to.</p>

Dad was there, taking the family grocery shopping, being patient, explaining things, showing genuine respect for himself, his family, his surroundings.

		<p>We should just do what India did, after independance. The Muslims in that country could not get along with the other religions, so the country was just partitioned between Hindus and Muslims. In the same way, for non-Hispanic whites to survive, we should just cut the country in half (yes, I will even give the minorities half the country), and let the race realistic whites have half the country, and the non-whites, plus the deluded &#8220;multiculturalist&#8221; whites have the other half. There, end of problem. Wonder how many people-other than us white race realists, would go for that? Probably very few. They love to ride on other peoples societies.</p>

		<p>From Jared&rsquo;s new book:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Demographers are beginning to warn that as well-educated, white baby boomers retire and are replaced by poorly educated blacks and Hispanics, the productivity gains of the last several hundred years will be reversed, and the United States could go into a tailspin&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In California this is already happening, and California, as usual, is leading the way.</p>
<p>According to &#8220;Hispanics, a Statistical Portrait&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fifty percent of Hispanic households use some form of welfare, the highest rate of any major population group&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s economy is reaching the breaking point according to the Migration Policy Institute:</p>
<p>&#8221;..As tax consumers continue to flood in from Mexico, and taxpayers flee, California is sinking in a sea of red ink. Its bond rating has been been dropped by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s to almost junk-bond status, lowest of the fifty states. </p>
<p>With 100,000 whites leaving each year and 43% of all Californians under eighteen Hispanic, California is becoming - indeed, has become - a Third World state&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>The new, replacement demographic vote themselves services with little regard as to where the money comes from  &mdash;  for productive Whites, these &#8216;free&rsquo; services mean satanic, punitive taxes imposed on them, their property, wages and businesses.  This is along with a diminished quality of life, crowds of foreigners, destroyed schools, rising crime  &mdash;  what&rsquo;s left to love in the Golden State?</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s budget is deep in the hole and the government tells us that unemployment in California is 12.9% and rising.  I suspect unemployment is much higher than that.  Lately I seem to be reading about a lot more crime in the local papers, especially home invasion robberies  &mdash;  but also car jackings, burglaries, bank  and armed robberies.  The suspects are usually hispanic males.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had two different hispanic groups come onto my property and ask me for &#8216;donations&rsquo; for scholarships.  They had no identification, no brochures, no details, nothing but fake sob stories.  I don&rsquo;t know if they were begging for money or casing my house looking for easy entry-points.  I told DH it&rsquo;s time to put up a 9-foot fortress-like wall around our property, just like the other neighbors, and in the meantime, keep the large pit bull/police dog in the front yard to scare off unwanted intruders with possible malicious intentions.</p>

		<p>My cousin has already left and relocated to Finland. He was lucky enough to get a position with an international company that paid all his moving expenses. He&rsquo;s decided to stay. I can&rsquo;t blame. I am already in the process of planning my exodus for my family and myself. There&rsquo;s much more wrong with the US than the change in demographics. The crushing debt and decline of the dollar will bring burdens that most cannot even imagine. If I thought that there was an organized effort to reverse these trends, then I&rsquo;d stay and fight. But as I see it now, the decline of the USA is inevitable. I have to consider my self preservation and the welfare of my family. I hope that others do the same.</p>

		<p>Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for making it abundantly clear to the world where we&rsquo;re heading with our incredibly stupid policies. It&rsquo;s just a shame nobody in a position to do anything about it is going to read or understand what you said, or act on it.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the coming catastrophe is probably unpreventable in our current political climate. Far too many people (the entire left wing and some deluded conservatives) buy the idea of egalitarianism, even though the evidence against such nonsense is staring them in the face. It will take an obvious, widespread, one-time catastrophic event to wake people up to the looming demographic disaster. This is equivalent to smacking someone with a 2 by 4 to get their attention. The problem is even smacking the American people (or at least the politicians) with a 2 by 4 is ineffective. Did 9/11 wake us up to the idea that Muslims want to do away with our society? Nope, we still coddle them. And did the &#8220;diversity recession&#8221; (http://www.vdare.com/sailer/081010_meltdown.htm) alert those in power to the idea that minorities can&rsquo;t replace Whites? No, it didn&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>And with the continued increase in immigration and excessive breeding by the current minority population, even the &#8220;Sailer strategy&#8221; (http://www.vdare.com/sailer/090920_2050.htm) doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance. I think the Democrats are onto something with the election of Obama - it&rsquo;s simple, just run a minority candidate, no matter how inexperienced or incapable, and they&rsquo;ll win. Or run a feminist woman. I honestly think Hillary could have beaten McCain last fall, too, for the same &#8220;historic&#8221; reasons Obama did. Change you can believe in.</p>
<p>That being the case, we will continue to see more net tax receivers fleecing fewer tax payers, until the economic system of the United States collapses under its own weight. How long can we continue to borrow from Japan and China before they stop buying our debt, debt we will never be able to pay back? How high will the liberals raise taxes before all innovation and business operation is stifled to the point of collapse? As long as their numbers keep going up, and there is nothing stopping the trend, the tax receivers will continue to vote in their own and the fleecing will continue.</p>
<p>Collapse of our once wonderful country probably won&rsquo;t come all at once. It will probably come as a series of shocks like the current recession ( oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, economists say it&rsquo;s over now, don&rsquo;t they? ). Yes, there will still be periods of growth and prosperity as the creative minds come up with ways around the current mess. But that won&rsquo;t last forever. Eventually even the most creative among us will not be able to overcome the demographic disaster. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll wake up one morning, turn on Good Morning America or The Today Show and see the collapse happen before our eyes. At least we won&rsquo;t recognize it as such. (Well, maybe WE will, but most won&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Now for the $64,000 question - what do we do about it? Really. Practically. Realistically.</p>

		<p>Many good comments on this article. To those who have left and plan to leave I wish you luck. Most of us cannot leave. I am an elderly woman who does not have the means to leave and all my grown children also do not have the means. But my question is, WHY should any of us have to leave? This is OUR country, not the blacks nor the Hispanics nor any other nonwhite! I want to also make a point that most of those Euro nations you flee to are going to be just like America in a few short years. Whites worldwide are too soft-hearted and too soft-headed to stay White. The same with far too many Whites in America. They have been so brainwashed that nothing will get them out of their stupor. I have tried to wake many up to no avail. I am just called a mean hateful racist. </p>
<p>So what to do? There will only be a small percentage of Whites that will fight for their own homelands and for their own blood, but did not our forefathers face the same problem? A small percentage fought against the British if I recall correctly. Only this time we have a heavier burden. We have allowed tens of millions of NON-whites into our land and every single one of them will come against those few Whites who are brave enough to stand and fight, not to mention the cowardly, multi-cult, bi-racial, racially mixed, traitorous White families who will side with the NON-whites. But even at my age I will fight on my feet and not on my knees.</p>

		<p>Those who doubt Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s accuracy have no need to wait for the future to unfold to see whether the effects he writes about will indeed obtain.  All you have to do is visit California, Texas, New Mexico, or Arizona to see the results of a continuous flood of illegal immigration.  Similarly, you can visit any large city school district to see the ruinous effects of multicultural.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something that is &#8220;gonna happen&#8221;.  It IS happening, all around you, right in front of you.  Most American Whites simply refuse to acknowledge what they see, and make excuses for the fallout of our idiotic government policies.</p>
<p>As for the preceding posts by viewers wondering how it can be countered, Americans must face a very uncomfortable fact:  the turning tide CAN&rsquo;T be countered with our present Democratic system, because in a representational democracy the group with the most votes will win.  The many, specifically the multicultural hordes and the vast sea of clueless Whites, tremendously outnumbers the few Whites who are aware of the looming destruction.  Certainly we few can use political maneuvering and persuasiveness to eventually bring many of our clueless brothers and sisters to our cause, but sadly it will be too little, too late for the simple reason that by the time we accomplish the Great Awakening, Whites as a whole will be a minority and with too few votes to effect reversal of the tide, or even meaningful change.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we must recognize that in the midst of demographic catastrophe, government &#8220;by the many&#8221; will not serve our best interests.  The only path forward is separation, and this time it must be a 100% separation - no exceptions for non-White adopted children, refugees, guest workers, good friends, foreign university students, etc.  As we have seen in EVERY Western nation, our intrinsic sense of fair play and compassion turn these exceptions into a problem that eventually masters us.  The only way we can preserve ourselves and our culture is to have our nation where we can live in peace and work for our own futures.</p>
<p>Every other approach to the problem will result in nothing more than prolonging the long painful slide to oblivion.</p>

<p>Here might be something that other white, racially healthy, AR readers might have also experienced.</p>
<p>Whenever a member of our white nationalist community, people who are probably far less intimidated than the average white-guilt ridden, TV addicted and brainwashed white individual one might encounter on the street about honestly discussing racial issues with non-whites - whenever I have opened a conversation with a non-white, or even a partially white/mixed race person, and sought their opinions on what a majority non-White America will look like, the responses I get from these non-whites are nearly always the same.  </p>
<p>First of all, they&rsquo;ll express excitement over the prospect of finally assuming the majority status and to then be able to lord over the whites.   I detect from this sort of response, a deep rooted resentment and animosity towards whites - although some of the minorities who expressed this sentiment will make an attempt to not be overly arrogant about this, so as to not cause undue offense to the white who asked them this question.  But, it is quite evident to me that they are eager and looking forward to finally having their foot on the backs of the white man&rsquo;s neck.  And, I might add, having no more obstacles between them and the white man&rsquo;s financial resources - or, perhaps, his pretty white females.</p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear even one minority non-white express any dismay or concern that the world and high civilization built by the white man will cease to exist, if the white man is dispossessed and removed from the driver&rsquo;s seat of Western civilization.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor has written at length and also discussed this strange and inexplicable phenomena whereby these various minorities, primarily blacks and hispanics,  who have never in the entire history of their race ever produced any sort of civilization that would remotely rival that of the Western civilizations built by European whites.  And, here&rsquo;s an even <br>
worse looking blemish on the historical resumes of these non-whites - whenever they have managed to seize absolute control over a civilization that had been built by whites, such as the former Rhodesia, or today&rsquo;s Haiti - in a matter of a decade or two, they&rsquo;ve completely destroyed it and it has reverted back to the third world hell-hole that their ancestors were so desperate to flee from.  </p>
<p>But, in my conversations about this subject with non-whites, I never hear any evidence that these minorities are fearful that their gravy train will end, once (and if) they achieve their long sought after demographic conquest of all White majority nations.    </p>
<p>This is a potentially grave and fatal mistake that many whites I know make; they give far too much undeserved credit to non-whites, and stupidly assume that they truly understand that life for them will be better if they allow the white man to continue to run the show.   This is a false assumption and we need to abandon it, friends.</p>
<p>The resentment felt by non-whites towards people of European descent is a powerful and dominating instinct, and the hidden force who stands in the shadows has this little nugget of truth figured out - and this is why we see 24/7, 365, around the clock media and Hollywood demonization of White people.   These forces are fertilizing and cultivating this climate of hate towards whites and it is deliberate.  </p>
<p>It would bode us well to polish our spectacles and peer into our future and recognize where all this demonization is taking us, and then the future for whites becomes horrifically clear.</p>
<p>If we continue to refuse to organize along racial lines and take our nation back, that is.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just&#8221; cut the country in half!  That&rsquo;s all.  Very simple. You make it sound so easy. <br>
But it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. People aren&rsquo;t going to  &#8220;just&#8221; voluntarily pack up and go.</p>
<p>Consider the partition of India:<br>
  <br>
 &#8220;Throughout India there were massive communal riots and massacres. The partition displaced up to 12.5 million people in the former British Indian Empire.<br>
16 August 1946  &mdash;  a day of widespread rioting and manslaughter in the city of Calcutta in the Bengal province of British India. The day also marked the start of what is known as &#8220;The Week of the Long Knives. <br>
In Calcutta, within 72 hours, more than 4,000 people lost their lives and 100,000 residents in the city of Calcutta were left homeless.   Violence in Calcutta sparked further riots in the surrounding regions&#8221; ..  [Wiki]</p>
<p> &#8220;Massive population exchanges occurred between the two newly-formed countries in the months immediately following Partition. Once the lines were established, roughly 12 million people crossed the borders to what they hoped was the safety of religious the majority.  <b>Massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border &mdash; leading to the deaths of as many as five million people </b> &mdash;  as the newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude.&#8221;<br>
http://www.indopedia.org/Partition_of_India.html</p>
<p>You want partition?  I&rsquo;m not arguing against it.<br>
I&rsquo;m just saying: be careful what you wish for.  Or at least know what you&rsquo;re getting into.</p>

<p>This is across the board whenever you establish statistics on international &#8220;comparisons&#8221;.</p>
<p>If ONLY whitey is counted in the U.S., WE stand up well against anyone. Right at the top in almost all categories. Good health, low crime rate, etc. BUT ONLY if whitey alone is counted. When you include the &#8220;others&rsquo; we as a nation are dragged way down.</p>

<p>Democrats do not want an informed middle class.  They want an uninformed proletariat that will always vote for Democrats.  So they&rsquo;re happy to encourage more illegal immigration.  Republicans also don&rsquo;t care if we have an informed middle class.  They want cheap labor.  If they can&rsquo;t find enough black or Hispanic engineers, they&rsquo;ll just import them from India or China.</p>

My cousin has already left and relocated to Finland. He was lucky enough to get a position with an international company that paid all his moving expenses. He&rsquo;s decided to stay. I can&rsquo;t blame. I am already in the process of planning my exodus for my family and myself. There&rsquo;s much more wrong with the US than the change in demographics. The crushing debt and decline of the dollar will bring burdens that most cannot even imagine. If I thought that there was an organized effort to reverse these trends, then I&rsquo;d stay and fight. But as I see it now, the decline of the USA is inevitable. I have to consider my self preservation and the welfare of my family. I hope that others do the same.(COMMENT FROM ABOVE)</p>
<p>You sound like an intelligent man, why don&rsquo;t you start an &#8220;organized effort&#8221; to reverse &#8220;these trends&#8221;. The leader of any such movement(if it ever comes about) will probably not have a college degree or a fancy car, job or family.

		<p>I wish I could agree with either those who are leaving for some mythical &#8220;safe haven&#8221; and those who insist one should &#8220;stand and fight&#8221;.  Unfortunately, neither course seems realistic to me.  From extensive internet reading and other sources, I firmly believe most/all of Western Europe will be Muslim controlled within the next 25-35 years.  I do not see any evidence that even half of the Whites left in the U.S. even admit to what is happening here, let alone possess the resolve to do something about it - they won&rsquo;t even entertain race realist thoughts, comments bring consequences, and actions are verboten and terrifying to most. </p>
<p>Yes, I am in despair over the future of this country, and a prime reason is that we brought this on ourselves.  I know God is in control and we deserve all we are getting, but I never hoped to live through this and it sickens me that my children will have to try to survive as a minority here.  There is nowhere in the world that is currently safe for Whites - and the snarky East European commenter is obviously ignorant of his history.  I was posted in Bulgaria with the Foreign Service - they remember Turkish occupation as though it was yesterday.  To assume the Muslims will somehow stop their conquest by birth with Western Europe is wishful thinking at best.  Demography is destiny and is something that cannot be changed/turned around/undone by fiat - it takes generations, and it&rsquo;s time that we just don&rsquo;t have.  The U.S. birthrate is higher than Europe&rsquo;s only by including blacks and hispanics.  I believe our White birthrate is below replacement level - anyone with the specific numbers, feel free to correct me.  </p>

<p>Sure.  Why not?  Do we not now live under a fraudulent republic with staged elections and a largely controlled press?  Most people in most societies throughout history have lived under autocratic rulers. Western societies have achieved great things without any democratic pretenses.  Who elected Queen Elizabeth I?  Who elected the Medici?  Who elected Marcus Aurelius?  A new aristocracy is not the end of the West.  Non-White immigration is.  <br>
     Perhaps, when the unpleasant but necessary work of driving the invaders from our soil is done, some kind of representative government could be re-established.  Voting would have to be limited to the most worthy citizens, and there are many historical examples to borrow from.  But until we&rsquo;ve reclaimed the country from the multi-cultural tyranny, democracy has as much value to us as it did to the Roman Army.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the $64,000 question - what do we do about it? Really. Practically. Realistically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is focus on the disease, not the symptoms.  9/11 actually did galvanize Americans but later as the dust settled facts were being uncovered and buried by the MSM.  The collapse of bldg 7, the foreign agents on an adjacent rooftop, the flashes and the way the towers collapsed have raised alot of questions with the public to the point where the majority do not believe the official government report. </p>
<p>Blaming minorities for the subprime mess is the equivalent of giving a child a gun to play with.  The child ends up shooting someone in the foot.  Is it the child&rsquo;s fault or the person that gave him the gun?  The government coerced lenders into relaxing the standards a person could qualify for a loan.  Welfare payments were counted as income, illegal aliens qualified, no downpayments, no verification of income or employment and high interest ARMS.  Minorities, especially blacks, have a history of being delinquent on loans which is why they have trouble getting credit.  The people who set this up knew exactly what they were doing and exactly what would happen.  Again, stay focused on the disease, not the symptoms.  </p>
<p>White America, excluding Census Bureau designated Whites is 71 percent of the voting electorate.  We are by no means outnumbered yet, even in California.  Those of you that bemoan the election of Obama consider this.  There was very little difference between Obama and McCain, they&rsquo;re both controlled by the same puppetmasters.  It did not matter who won because it is merely a continuation of the status quo.  His voter base is greatly exaggerated because millions of us White Nationalists voted for him to shock White America out of it&rsquo;s trance.  <br>

		<p>  &#8220;There is nothing to fight for. Its over. Demographic realities cannot be fought. A minority does not rule over a majority except through undemocratic means. Are you really prepared for that? Better to let America die.&#8221; [#23, anon.]<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I detest such  negativism! </p>
<p>What do you mean, &#8220;There is nothing to fight for&#8221;?    What do you mean,  &#8220;It&rsquo;s over&#8221;?   And, yes, demographic realities CAN be fought!  We are not helpless. Birth rates are not set in stone. White birthrates can be raised, and illegal alien infiltration can be curbed.   Immigration can be reduced or completely stopped.  There is no reason why we just have to accept this situation passively and give up.</p>
<p>As for preserving democratic rule at all costs, do you really think that when   the new majority comes to power (however democratically) that whites will be treated well and fairly?  Is that new majority likely to be so concerned (as you are) about preserving and respecting YOUR democratic rights?   Will they treat us with the same solicitude and generosity that we showed to them?</p>
<p>I fully agree with everything Schoolteacher said!  Democracy (as with socialism) serves well when applied to a homogeneous and related population with like interests.  But  (though I hate to say it)  it may soon have served its purpose in America.  If it&rsquo;s going to become   &mdash;   as it is in South Africa  and Rhodesia right now -  a millstone, an instrument to torment us and destroy us, then it is no longer to our interest. There&rsquo;s no sensible reason to retain a blind, reflexive loyalty to something passé that has become a curse and no longer a blessing.</p>
<p>Historically, democracy is quite a new concept in the world, a European concept,  and a very unique one at that.  Even now, it is limited in scope to only a few countries  which really practice it.   We Americans have imbued the praises of democracy all our lives   &mdash;   to the extent that it is impossible for many of us to conceive of anything else.  </p>
<p>But democracy in every time in history, and in every place, has been the extremest rarity.   As Schoolteacher pointed out, great ages in the past have occurred under regimes that made no pretense of being democratic.  I do not want to advocate this, but perhaps this is what we shall have to come to, if it&rsquo;s forced on us.   I would base it on the fundamental question:  &#8220;Is it good for <b><i>the whites</i></b>?&#8221;</p>

Also, as someone else added, don&rsquo;t think the eastern Europe is &#8220;safe&#8221; from muliticulturalism. Russia has a lot of muslims and even if multiculturalism does not come to a few eastern Europeans countries, with the rest of the white Western world going multicult- ie.Europe,North America, Australia,- it will give you serious problems being outnumbered all around.</p>

<p>Maybe this is because our &#8216;government&rsquo; has put in place so many social engineering measures.  Those measures basically put exponents on the effects of our population&rsquo;s browning.  If blacks and browns could be allowed to do (or not do) in accordance with their abilities, off to themselves, then we whites would not have our own productivity reduced.  </p>
<p>But as it is, blacks and browns are forcibly injected into workplace situations that are inappropriate for them.  As another AMREN poster once noted, &#8220;They&rsquo;re gumming up the machinery of commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks this state of affairs came about by accident is naive.  It was long ago noted that the resiliency of The American People made us impervious.  We kept rebounding: no matter what was thrown at us.  The only way to defeat and destroy America was to fundamentally change Americans. Diluting our population genetically is permanently changing us.  We only need wonder which among our enemies is behind this.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that foreign historians will puzzle over that happened to Occidentals.  Foreign powers are already quietly chuckling over their imminent success in diluting and destroying us.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m mixed race. Not White, and don&rsquo;t think I am, won&rsquo;t say I am, but won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not, depending on when it&rsquo;s strategic. Chinese and old American Brit. Don&rsquo;t look a bit Chinese. Six feet tall, 165 lbs, lean, skin the color of chalk. Ivy League educated, extremely high-IQ, associated with some top dollar Manhattan money, and a family member is often receiving awards from my university, most recently the highest one, won by a U.S. president some time before him. Have gone as Russian my whole life, and even won the fancy of some local Polish skinheads in Brooklyn when I was younger. Even had an Indian girl chasing me to see what it was like to be with a White.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loyal to the dang bone to Whites and Europe. Tried for a while to get in touch with my Chinese side. Couldn&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t plan on having kids either, unless I can secure them in a world where they will be surrounded by Whites. I know what you&rsquo;ve all done. I like living around you. I understand what&rsquo;s yours is yours. I like looking at Whites. I don&rsquo;t like living around dysgenic, ugly, low-IQ browns. I&rsquo;m too smart to see it all end like this. Every day I tell myself that it&rsquo;s not my fight. But hell, my dear old White grandma has been too kind to me to let her go down like this, and my little cousins, all blue eyed and blonde haired, when I sit with them at Christmas and feel terrible for what my father did, deserve better than anything the world is going to throw at them in the next few decades.</p>
<p>So count me in. I&rsquo;m in fighting shape, ruthless, intelligent and I have absolutely nothing to lose. Nothing. But you guys do.</p>

		<p>Most demographic models assume endless population growth. &#8220;Things that cannot last, do not last.&#8221; Who grows the food in this world? Who feeds the 3rd world? Whites do. And as our population shrinks, so will the food supply. Thus far most 3rd worlders (excluding east Asians, who face serious land constraints) have not demonstrated an ability to feed themselves, but they certainly can procreate. Add soil depletion, increasing water scarcity, desertification, and hydrocarbon depletion and you see the emerging problem. We can&rsquo;t delay Malthus forever. Its only a matter of time. <br>
Furthermore, rich well-fed whites can afford their liberal attitudes towards the brown masses. Poor hungry whites cannot. The economic depression we&rsquo;re just now entering has done more to wake up whites than anything else in the past 70 years, just imagine what things will be like when the most basic commodities run scarce. Its not a pretty picture, but the only alternative would be for the 3rd world to:<br>
a. stabilize their population growth (not happening)<br>
b. grow their own food (not happening)<br>
c. coexist peacefully with whites (hahahaha!)<br>
a, b, and c would ALL have to happen for us to avert catastrophe. We&rsquo;d be lucky to get one of the three. For those of you old enough to remember the 50&rsquo;s, God bless you for you lived during the last Golden Age. It&rsquo;s all downhill from here!</p>

<p>&#8220;What good does pessimism of the sort that you portray do? Please tell me what your solution is? Are you saying the end of our race is inevitable so we should all just go home and sit and wait for it to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtney and others, you need to pin down exactly what the problem is before you can solve it.  No one is doing that.  If you don&rsquo;t identify it you&rsquo;ll be spinning your wheels for the next few decades until we lose all and any political power we have to effect any kind of change.  Some of you seem to be totally clueless because it&rsquo;s not just about immigration and changing demographics.  Look at the decline in morality, the de-Christianization of America, sodomy rights, radical feminisim, greed, subprime mess, the collapse of the economy, the infiltration of the church and the teaching of false doctrines, hate crime laws, demise of the dollar, Iran and the endless wars, etc.  I could go on and on but you get the idea.  These things all have a common denominator. Do some research and look at the people or organizations involved in these topics and it will come to you as if a veil had been lifted from your eyes.   <br>

<p>The government counts those who &#8216;earn&rsquo; a GED as graduates thereby boosting graduation rates.  In reality, the government is trying to cover up its failing schools and lead people to believe that the low IQd population it is massively importing is &#8216;no different from Whites&rsquo; (so therefore, you Whites stop complaining about your displacement, after all we are all the same!)  </p>
<p>Does anyone believe the Hostile Elites who control the government believe this?  You know, the ones who send their precious children to exclusive private schools such as Sidwell Friends so they don&rsquo;t have to attend school with violent blacks or low IQd hispanics.</p>
<p>Economist James J. Heckman, a Nobel Laureate and 2002 Statistician of the Year,  and co-author Paul A. LaFontaine of the American Bar Association report:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In contrast to the federal propaganda&hellip;the dropout rate is around 35 percent.. for those more assimilated Hispanics who either were born in America or have been here at least a decade..&#8221;</p>

<p>And according to &#8216;Hispanics A Statistical Portrait&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hispanics who have been in the United States for more than three generations are twice as likely as whites and slightly more likely than blacks to report not having a high school diploma&hellip; Hispanics who remain in school have lower test scores than whites.:.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;.It sounds like they were casing your place to me&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought the same thing.</p>
<p>One must remain vigilant at all times in California what with its massive, seething non-White underclass, high unemployment rates and fleeing White tax base.</p>

		<p>Since 1965, with the change of the immigration act, and low white birth rates, our nation has slowly been committing racial suicide. Unless this change can be reversed, which I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope for, we are going to turn into a 3rd world nation. What is this disease of the mind that allows a nation to give away it&rsquo;s birthright and allow itself to be displaced by immigrant 3rd world hordes and other minorities and let itself be taken over? If South Africa isn&rsquo;t a warning and a wake up call, along with what is currently happening here, I don&rsquo;t know what else can be shown to wake white people up. </p>
