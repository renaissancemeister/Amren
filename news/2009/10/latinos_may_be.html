<h1>Latinos May Be &#8216;Future&rsquo; of U.S. Catholic Church</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Probst, CNN, October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>The stuffed pepper causing the stutter is the hottest menu item at St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Lenten fish fry in St. Louis, Missouri. Chile rellenos, a traditional Mexican dish, have replaced fish as the main draw for Catholics giving up meat on Fridays. This century-old parish founded by German immigrants has turned 85 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the browning of the Catholic Church in the United States,&#8221; says Pedro Moreno Garcia, who until last month led the Hispanic ministry for the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Moreno Garcia points to St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Spanish-dominant Mass schedule as a sign of the times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics are the present and Hispanics are the future of the Catholic Church in the United States,&#8221; says Moreno Garcia.</p>
<p>One-third of all Catholics in the United States are now Latinos thanks to immigration and higher fertility rates, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. While St. Cecilia&rsquo;s parish has relished the growth, elsewhere, the Latino population boom has rocked the pews.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;Latino in America&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Latino population is set to nearly triple by 2050. CNN&rsquo;s Soledad O&rsquo;Brien journeys into the homes and hearts of a group destined to change the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One archdiocese parish that is struggling with the Latino influx is Holy Trinity in St. Ann, Missouri, a suburban community with an affordable housing stock that has prompted a population shift in the last decade. Video Pedro Moreno Garcia is working to bridge language barriers, divisions Â»</p>
<p>Separate Sunday morning Masses in English and in Spanish at Holy Trinity are creating division among the devout.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re two separate parishes operating under one roof,&#8221; says Parish Council President Gina Shocklee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refer to it as Holy Trinity Catholic Church, and then there&rsquo;s Holy Trinity Hispanic Church,&#8221; says council member Jody Tedeschi, who worries the separate Masses promote segregation.</p>
<p>Holy Trinity&rsquo;s parish council has spent the past year looking for ways to bridge the divide with limited success.</p>
<p>Part of that complicated picture is the family of Mexican-born Angelica Garcia, the new face of Holy Trinity. She has lived in the United States for 18 years; Holy Trinity has been her parish for the last four.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come to Mass at noon, the Anglos leave, and [Latinos] go in and we don&rsquo;t even say &#8216;hi&rsquo; to each other, not even &#8216;hi,&rsquo;&#8221; says Garcia. &#8220;Sometimes I think there is a wall, but that wall exists only because we don&rsquo;t have enough faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A majority of Latino churchgoers in the United States attend Mass with mostly Latinos in the pew and Spanish-speaking clergy at the pulpit, according to a 2006 Pew Forum survey. Today, 15 percent of priests ordained in the United States are Latinos, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.</p>

		<p>You mean like Europe? It will only get worse. Soon they will demand their own churches&hellip; by demanding whites leave because they &#8216;were here first&rsquo;. Same as Blacks who form their own churches and now are protesting the influx of Hispanics.</p>

<p>Yeah, sure, sure, that&rsquo;s what they all say.</p>
<p>It sounds like the Catholic Church in America is headed for a major breakup. Surely there have been religious schisms down through history resulting in the formation of new sects over far more minor issues than this.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m Catholic. I have no problem worshiping alongside a legal citizen of the United States of any race. However, we speak English. And unless you attend the Traditional Latin Mass (which I prefer), you should learn English so you may follow the liturgy. That is what will bridge any &#8220;gap.&#8221; </p>
<p>One word, Hispanic Catholics: Assimilate. The wall is there because you keep expecting a foreign country to bow to you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so much an issue of faith as an issue of cultural identity&hellip;..translated: they don&rsquo;t identity with white people, which includes linguistic assimilation. Face it, Latinos don&rsquo;t make the effort to become English proficient, and why should they when every entity bends over backwards to accommodate their lack of effort and limited mental ability to learn the language of the land they live in.</p>

<p>This was EXACTLY the case at the California parish I attended growing up. Whites and Filipinos went to the English mass at 10:30. They then left and the Mexicans went to Spanish mass at noon. There was no interaction between the two groups. </p>

		<p>Once upon a time these folks were called &#8220;Mission Catholics.&#8221; The more affluent parishes provided funding, food and clothing to these same people who could never make ends meet. </p>
<p>Now, we are being told that these people will be running the Church?</p>

- - - A.G. - Wake up.  There&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re going to assimilate.  This is the weakness of Catholics, this foolish universalism and belief that these people care about these things and that they will somehow - by the grace of God - become good, kind, wonderful citizens.  Granted a few are or will. They are far and away the exception to the rule. This is no reason to continue to destroy our country by letting illegals into it.  We can never expect them to be concerned about becoming like us.  We though, are getting weaker and weaker; physically, morally, and collectively.</p>

		<p>In Chicago, in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, mayor Richard Joseph Daley did everything in his power to drive lawbiding roman catholics out to replace them with protestants imported from the South. The sothern protestants could be depended on to bring a high percentage of votes for Daley. Only Irish catholics could be counted on as reliable; the other catholics were lukewarm to daley. They just were not corrupt. <br>
   At that time, the church was a santuary from racial problems. That is until enrollment decreased and the church closed.<br>
   Now his son is importing mexicans. They can be relied on to support his corrupt government. They have taken over the churches. They glare at you. All services become mostly spanish. Five years ago, I stopped going to church, because I am afraid of the mexicans. First time in my life, I have stopped.<br>
   I would like my catholic church back. </p>

<p>I guess this could be a bit of brightness on an otherwise dark event BUT! there are more than 20 million blacks converting to the muslim ideaology and worse! to the Nation of Islam criminal enterprise.

		<p>It&rsquo;s about MONEY.  The Catholic church is a BUSINESS and like every other business needs REVENUE.  However, its support of illegal immigration is faulty and has done much to drive away Catholics from the organized institutional Church.<br>
I STILL consider myself a Catholic as far as doctrine is concerned but I REFUSE to support a Church that &#8220;looks the other way&#8221; when it comes to illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>My daughter&rsquo;s CYC (Catholic Youth) soccer team recently played the team from Holy Trinity, the church mentioned in the article. I noticed at the time that most of the Holy Trinity team looked Mexican, as did the parents who came to watch the game.I thought this seemed unusual in St. Louis, as we are nowhere near the Mexican border. I guess the border is moving north. A bit of good news: our girls trounced Holy Trinity 8-0.</p>

		<p>From the original article: &#8220;After more than 15 years working for the Catholic Church in majority-Hispanic areas of Texas, Moreno Garcia spent the last year tackling the challenges of a community where Latinos, although growing, are still the minority.</p>
<p>He recalls a few heated phone calls after the archdiocese newspaper, the St. Louis Review, added a page in Spanish. He fights prejudice with thought-provoking questions. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you go to heaven, and you&rsquo;re in front of St. Peter, what would you want to have in your hand, your baptismal certificate or your passport?&#8221; Moreno Garcia asks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nice, an appeal to emotionalism instead of the right of nations to determine who may and may not be allowed in their country.  These people seem to forget that Christians are to obey man made laws unless they conflict with the Law of God, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any passage in Scripture that commands us to allow ourselves to be overrun by invaders, whether &#8220;peaceful&#8221; or criminal.  What&rsquo;s next, inviting in 100 million Muslims so we can show then &#8220;Christian&#8221; charity too?  </p>
<p>Suicide is not one of God&rsquo;s commandments.<br>

		<p>The Vietnamese use the church building for mass for a while.  They save their money and soon build their own church building.  The Koreans do the same.  The Hispanics don&rsquo;t.  The same thing is going on at our church.  The predominantly White english speaking parishioners provide 80% or more of the funds for operating the church, while the separate spanish speaking parishioners invest next to nothing.  They have no desire to learn english and have mass with everyone else.  Yet they want to have full use of all facilities that someone else pays for .    And of course they are always dressed to the nines and most drive fancy modified cars and trucks.  There is a reason no one says hi.  And it is not a lack of faith.  It is their lack of credibility and responsibility.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to add that these bleeding heart types like Moreno Garcia probably protested our military invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan as &#8220;attacks on sovereign nations, killing innocent civilians&#8221; while the invasion of our sovereign nation, including violent criminals who rape and kill (with plenty of DUI manslaughter in the mix), continued unabated.</p>

		<p>I once attended a mixed race Catholic mass in Denver. I&rsquo;m against immigration, but there were no apparent problems at the church. Everything was in English, people said hi to each other, etc. As a kid I went to a church with Portuguese and Irish. There were some problems, but I had friends with both groups. I&rsquo;m not liberal, just saying that it depends on the individual in some cases.</p>
<p>I now attend an almost all white Episcopal church. They are ultra-liberal. I don&rsquo;t go so much because i can&rsquo;t believe how collectively stupid they are. There worst act was to allow the homeless to do anything they want&hellip;use the restroom in the children&rsquo;s school, eat all of the food, and basically roam around unwatched. There are homeless men lurking in the children&rsquo;s education area. Some could invariably be predators. I have spoken with the priest about it, she agreed. The liberal children&rsquo;s education manager told me that I worried too much. In the end, no one acted to protect the kids. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet you ten dollars that church-going blacks and Mexicans would try to protect their kids. There is no one more hatefully ignorant than white liberals.    </p>

		<p>Within 40 years I&rsquo;ve lost my church and my country. My ancestors worked and sacrificed to build these houses of worship in the past two centuries. Now, Hispanics have moved in and marked them like so much gang territory.</p>
<p>Once upon a time every Catholic child was required to read and memorize his catechism in order to participate in his faith. Today&rsquo;s Hispanics kids are woefully ignorant of Catholicism, its history, and its beliefs   &mdash;   they pray to Jesus Malverde, the Narco saint. As I&rsquo;ve said on this website before, their ignorance makes them ripe for conversion to Islam in the next century.</p>
<p>The US is doomed.</p>
