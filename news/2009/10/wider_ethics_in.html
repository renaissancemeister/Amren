			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Raymond Hernandez, New York Times, October 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House Ethics Committee announced on Thursday that it had expanded its investigation into a series of questionable financial dealings made by Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The investigation was expanded to include amendments that Mr. Rangel made to his House financial disclosure statements in August. The amendments indicated that he had failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets from 2002 through 2006, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation.</p>
<p>Assets and sources of income that he omitted include a Merrill Lynch Global account valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, tens of thousands of dollars in municipal bonds and $30,000 to $100,000 in rent from a multifamily brownstone he owned.</p>

		<p>     Turn on the spin machine, Barney. When was the last time you heard of a Democrat resigning because he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar ? He&rsquo;ll probably get a Nobel Prize for Creative Accounting.</p>

		<p>If you can&rsquo;t get rid of someone as crocked as Charles B. Rangel, then how can you ever expected to get rid of anyone?</p>
<p>Besides, his replacement will be just as crooked, or soon will become.</p>

<p>Of course his replacement will be just as bad, OR worse. And SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Rangle will not resign, and if he does, a black will replace him. Because, as SKIP the psychic predicted&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.once a political big chief position is in black hands, they will NEVER let it go peacefully, nor gracefully.</p>

		<p>The irony is too thick to spread over the institutions that deserve to be ridiculed.  The Ways and Means Committee Head and the Secretary of the Treasury are both admitted tax cheats and no one in authority has the moral fiber to exclaim that these are the wrong leaders and must be replaced.<br>
Conversely, I suppose this is consistent with having a Marxist Empty Suit as the President of the US.</p>
