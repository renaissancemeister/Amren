<h1>Out of the &rsquo;Hood  &mdash;  A Derrion Albert Parable</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronica-Marche Miller, The Root, October 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>My parents made a choice to keep us away from black neighborhoods. Now I realize it may have been a choice between living and dying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I think about the very things my dad was working to protect us from when my siblings and I were growing up in the early &rsquo;90s. Our home was in Beechview, at the time a quiet, mostly white, working-class neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It made us the butt of jokes from a lot of our black friends, who lived on the east side of town. &#8220;No one can find your house!&#8221; they&rsquo;d say. &#8220;Y&rsquo;all live waaaaaaaay over there! Y&rsquo;all live with the white folks!&#8221;</p>
<p>But living with the black folks  &mdash;  in Homewood, Wilkinsburg, East Liberty or on the Hill  &mdash;  was not an option in my parents&rsquo; eyes. Yeah, our people lived there  &mdash;  but so did the local news.</p>
<p>Gang violence, drug wars, fights and assaults at schools  &mdash;  all of it showed up on our television screen every night at 11 and every morning at 6. Or we heard about it through firsthand accounts. &#8220;Someone got shot across the street last night,&#8221; our childhood friends would tell us. &#8220;My neighbor&rsquo;s brother got stabbed last week.&#8221; Drives through the neighborhoods, for the occasional visits to see our acquaintances, showed us dilapidated houses, broken windows and groups of men huddled on the corners. Our church sat right across from a rundown housing project, and we were never allowed to venture beyond a one-block radius from the giant cross  &mdash;  because that would put us in gang-ridden Larimer.</p>
<p>But even the sanctity of the church grounds couldn&rsquo;t fully protect us from what was going on in the neighborhood. I remember being 8 years old and going to the lawn to play it-tag with my friends from the youth choir after a weeknight rehearsal. We were running, giggling, laughing and trying to tackle each other with a glee that you hear only from little kids in the summertime. Then the gunshots. They came from across the street. Now we were really running full speed into the church, into the safety of our parents&rsquo; arms. Seeing a group of little ones run into the sanctuary, crying hysterically, was enough to send our parents into hysterics themselves.</p>
<p>It became the norm for my family to venture to the other side of town only when necessary, to go to church and visit friends. We wouldn&rsquo;t go over there if it got too late. And as for us kids? Well, there was no way we were going over there by ourselves. If our little friends wanted to see us, Dad would say, they were more than welcome to come to our house.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t mind being the occasional butt of jokes for living among the &#8220;others&#8221;  &mdash;  because at least in our home, we didn&rsquo;t have to try to sleep amid sirens and gunshots. And he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about whether his children would make it home. {snip}</p>
<p>We loved our people, but we couldn&rsquo;t live with them.<br>

		<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t stop.  Miss Miller&rsquo;s parents move so they can live among white people.  Then more blacks flee the ghetto.  But those that move have ghetto relatives that visit, and eventually move into the neighborhood.  After awhile, the formerly nice white neighborhood becomes the ghetto.</p>

		<p>I have noticed this about Black people who are more successful or who generally have it together want to get out of all Black neighborhoods as quickly as possible. With very good reason as this woman states. I do wonder why they did not change churches to get their children totally out of that sort of environment. </p>

		<p>Veronica-Marche Miller is clearly a racist.  I wonder if the NAACP and the SPLC will go after her.  Perhaps she will get fired for her insensitive statements and outlandish claims.  She definitely needs to attend a reprogramming session at a &#8220;Cultural-Diversity&#8221; workshop.</p>

<p>White people love white people which is why white people want to live with white people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how white people are perfectly content with living with our own. We&rsquo;re the only group forbidden to do so.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Too many black Americans aren&rsquo;t safe in their own neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>But whites are not safe in black neighborhoods and neither is anyone else.  But she seems only bothered that blacks are not safe in black neighborhoods.  Many of those black degenerate neighborhoods used to be nice, white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>After that Chicago gang beating there was a black activist on CNN and the anchor asked if he was telling people to cooperate with police.  He would not even do that.  The anchor asked again, in disbelief, if he was telling people to cooperate with police.  He would not answer.  The anchor then asked the black community activist what needs to be done and he said Obama needs to send funds to the community to create jobs and community centers.  In other words, more of the same that has not worked in the past.</p>

		<p>In an abstract sort of way, those who promote integration by those of the &#8220;Black&#8221; race into Latino, Asian, or White communities and schools may have morally sound arguments. The problem is that once they arrive, so does their failed dysfunctional &#8220;culture&#8221;.  It doesn&rsquo;t take long before the new schools and neighborhoods are virtually indistinguishable from the ones they fled. </p>

<p>Indeed. The writer mentions East Liberty, which is where Billy Conn, the greatest light heavyweight boxer of all time, grew up. Back then, it was a tough, working class Irish neighborhood. Now it is a black ghetto.</p>
<p>You know, I used to make a semi-serious argument to blacks and white liberals about the need for reparations for whites. The ethnic cleansing of whole neighborhoods and communities built for and by whites was one of the things they were flummoxed by and had obviously never considered.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth, so&rsquo;s to speak. There is a book out, authured be a well kwown reporter, her name is Mona something. the book made  the times bestseller&rsquo;s list,its called &#8220;Do-Gooders&#8221;.   the book seems well researched &amp; factual. In said book she says that crime in the black area&rsquo;s was, for the most part not prosecuted before the 1950&rsquo;s, pretty much like dog bites dog who cares?I wonder if that has a bearing on the rampant crime in heavily black area&rsquo;s<br>
   I&rsquo;m a blue eyed cracker that grew-up in apredominitly black area &amp; at a very young age knew what streets not to be caught on,but 2 miles away in any direction the houses were well kept and orderly and it was safe to be there,how can that be-what does law-enforcement do with all the money that&rsquo;s pumped-in to it?It seems to me that it (crime) is allowed,maybe even condoned, so long as it stays in that area.Just a thought</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s going to take more than this sob story to pressure us Whites to diversify our neighborhoods.  If your story is true I feel for you but you need to get with like minded blacks and form a community where you can raise your children in a decent environment.  That&rsquo;s what Whites do.  That&rsquo;s what hispanics do.  That&rsquo;s what every other race does in fact.  I&rsquo;m going to be quite blunt about it.  We don&rsquo;t want to live around you.  We don&rsquo;t want your kids destroying the schools we pay taxes to put them in.  We don&rsquo;t want our kids around your kids.  I know the pattern of black dysfunction.  After they move in the walls of other homes would start vibrating from their stereo system blasting boom boom boom music throughout the neighborhood.  Neighbors will kindly ask them to turn it down and they will but the same thing will happen the next week, then the next.  They&rsquo;ll let their yard maintenance go and start putting junk out in the front yard.  The homeowner&rsquo;s association will be called to no affect.  One neighbor finally calls the police because they&rsquo;re disturbing the peace.  The first thing that would happen would be the houses on either side of them would suddenly go up for sale.  The black neighbors, ticked off at Whitey wanting them to behave will call some friends or relatives to check out the houses for sale.  They move in.  You can hear their loud voices inside your house to the tune of &#8220;I had dat b$tch like dis&#8221;.  &#8220;Bip bip bip whip whip&#8221;.  Suddenly you see junked up Nissans with wheelbarrow sized tires, spoilers, dirty black tinted windows and gold rims cruising through the neighborhood.  The neighborhood continues to deteriorate to the point where people can&rsquo;t sell their homes and they end up renting them out, sometimes for section 8 vouchers.  </p>

<p>I think I know what you&rsquo;re talking about.  In the segregated South, one of its ironic tenets was that white authorities allowed blacks to have sort of their own safe haven bubble where they could be more promiscuous, sexually and otherwise, than whites would have allowed themselves to be, and to the point where it would have been a crime otherwise, e.g. prostitution.  White authorities didn&rsquo;t prosecute minor black-on-black crimes, they allowed blacks to have their own relatively crude form of vigilante justice.  </p>
<p>In a few instances where whites committed attacks against blacks for no good reason, those whites were thrown into the black bubble.  Which was not a place you wanted to be if you were white and you raped a decidedly underaged black girl.</p>
<p>But when black misbehavior affected whites, then the hammer came down.</p>

<p>Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom report that blacks claim to prefer living in neighborhoods that are at least half black.   The tipping point that sparks White Flight, according to the Thernstroms, is when a White neighborhood becomes eight percent black.  I would add that forced busing precipitated as much if not more White Flight.</p>

		<p>This piece underscores a perhaps unappreciated and sad facet of the black &#8220;culture,&#8221; which is the plight of well-intentioned and potentially upwardly mobile blacks who have to suffer the destructiveness and criminality of other blacks on a day to day basis.  The simple fact is that black crime mostly targets other blacks, if only because of proximity.</p>
<p>While blacks undeniably account for a hugely disproportionate share of crime in this country, the fact remains that most blacks are not criminals but victims of their own people.</p>

		<p>I have no problem freely associating with civilized, decent black Americans like this lady and her family.  Associating with them a co-worker or fellow parent or next door neighbor.  I&rsquo;d prefer not too many, because once a certain density is reached the environment will change, even if they are decent folk, and the neighborhood or workplace will feel less like &#8220;ours&#8221; and more &#8220;theirs.&#8221;  This is a natural thing to want to avoid.  But I have no problem living with a small number of non-whites in my midst.  </p>
<p>Thankfully, neither do most other whites, including most of those who aren&rsquo;t poisoned with liberalism and self-hate.  It comports with white European mores of decency and fair play, something that Jared Taylor talks about, which is NOT a liability as long as it is moderated by common sense.  Black people who are genuinely able to assimilate into white society without the aid of affirmative action or sub-prime loans or other racial spoils should be welcomed and encouraged.  </p>
<p>One other thing   &mdash;   capitalizing &#8220;White&#8221; while leaving the word &#8220;black&#8221; lowercase as a way of showing which &#8220;team&#8221; you&rsquo;re cheering on looks silly, almost as silly as capitalizing Black but not white.  Sillier, actually.  </p>

		<p>I hope the author of this article has come to realize it was whites, with their collective behavior, made the environment where she lived livable from day to day. The reason why whites don&rsquo;t like living around blacks is the same reason why her family chose not to live around their own kind. It&rsquo;s not skin color. It&rsquo;s the behavior of blacks that causes whites to find areas to live that are away from a sizable population of blacks.</p>

		<p>Culture matters.  Not all cultures produce healthy citizens. The dissembling, post-moderenist multi-culti thoughts on culture professes the opposite.  The solution to every problem is just more money. This American-specific belief is held no where else in the world.  A case can be made, based on grades and jail terms in Black ghettos, that the more money spent in these areas, the more likely you will get thugs.</p>
<p>A thought or two on Black culture, from economics to hip-hop to sports; from education to AA, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an economic principle that a good way to gauge the health of a particular community is to determine the number of times a dollar turns within that community.  That is, once a dollar enters the community from the outside, how many times does it change hands within that community?  The more it does, the healthier the community.  Little Cuba?  Eight times.  China Town?  Almost eight times.  Harlem?  Once.  A dollar enters Harlem and immediately leaves.  We see a larger version of this with our Chinese friends our trade imbalance.</p>
<p>Music that glorifies thuggery, rape, etc., is not a high water mark for any culture.  Someone mentioned that there are few dads in the Black community; where are they?</p>
<p>Sports is dominated by Blacks.  Good for them.  But I stopped watching it after the &#8220;In yo face, sucka!&#8221; type of rap became mainstream.  I don&rsquo;t need that pumped into my home&hellip;the same reason Veronica&rsquo;s parents moved them out of the ghetto.  Show a little humility.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action.  When I get on an airliner from a company with strong AA policies and look in the cockpit and see a Black and a woman what thought am I left with?  &#8220;Did they make it on their own or, did they meet lower standards?&#8221;  And when they see me looking at them, what do they think?  &#8220;Cracker thinks I skated in to this seat, but he can&rsquo;t know that this woman and I were #1 &amp; #2 in our class.&#8221;  AA only increases prejudice by making us assume a substandard for Blacks and women, which many times is an accuarate assessment. </p>
<p>The hand that gives is always above the hand that receives. How does this make a Black man feel?  Pretty darn lousy I&rsquo;d guess.  AA does not work in any sense at all.  </p>

		<p>Being a black person whose IQ is within the triple digit range, I have to say that I often wish my parents had the wherewithal to move us away from my South Bronx neighborhood and all the problems that comes along with residing in a black community. Not that I don&rsquo;t love my people or regard them as inferior, mind you. It&rsquo;s just that I recognize how much of black failures are self-inflicted, and that most blacks refuse to even acknowledge this as their own fault; something that frustrates me to no end.</p>
<p>Indeed. Blacks are, without a doubt, there own worse enemies.</p>

		<p>A Black acquaintance once told me that when he and his friends attended any party in a Black neighborhood, they always placed guns in the trunks of their cars, in case they needed them.  In contrast, they never carried guns when going into a white area or to a party in a White part of town, because they new that the probability of violence was very low   &mdash;   i.e., he new the difference between black and White behavior. But, this same Black man complained about the fact that White women would lock their cars when driving through a Black neighborhood   &mdash;   he thought it was racist!  There is something wrong with the way that Blacks think.  It is also interesting that Black women will lock their car doors when a Black man approaches.</p>

		<p>Blacks fleeing their own neighborhoods should be called &#8220;black flight&#8221; by those who concern themselves with this sort of behavior. Studies should then be encouraged to see why blacks want to leave their own homes to move into White areas. Of course the answer would not be politically correct so a study of black flight will never be done. Instead the liberal elite will only concern themselves with White flight and what the government can do to stop it. Better to have everyones living together so that Whites can enjoy black crime and poverty too.</p>
<p>As an aside, I just read that Barack Obama has won the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>
https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_nobel_peace<br>
I have to wonder how a black man can win a peace prize when there is no peace in black neighborhoods. Apparently the Nobel Peace Prize is now just a worthless tradition as Obama has done absolutely nothing to promote peace anywhere at any time.</p>

		<p>Many years ago while working on my second degree program (yes I was working full time as they did not outsourced the job I worked for over 25 years to India until 2004) I met a black man in LA that told me how he had been raised in south central.</p>
<p>He literally had to retreat to his apartment after about the third grade as the gangs were becoming so bad it wasn&rsquo;t safe for non-violent black males who couldn&rsquo;t fight to be outside anymore. He grew up in his living room. He never left it except for the rare occassion his mother took him to the doctor. He didn&rsquo;t attend school. He just learned from books his mother brought him from the library in the living room. There are thousands of young black kids growing up like this in South Central LA and probably other cities like Chicago, Detroit, and New York as well. They are apartment prisoners. Imprisoned by the out of control violence of their own black neighbors. </p>

<p>Mr. Tiffany:<br>
I can go along with the argument that these men deserve decent schools and safe streets.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they deserve for someone else to pay for them.</p>
<p>My tax load is staggering right now,and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse. A large part of that tax load can be attributed to the antics and misbehavior of the black population of this country over the past 40 years. I&rsquo;ve had it. I&rsquo;ve had it with being told I&rsquo;m a racist-although since I am a racist,I can&rsquo;t very well complain about the term. I don&rsquo;t like the insult that&rsquo;s implied,though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with shysters like Jesse Jackson,and I&rsquo;ve had it with those on trial in Knoxville. </p>
<p>If these men deserve safe streets and decent schools,there&rsquo;s a place called Liberia,which-since it was set up as a haven for freed slaves-will do very well as a home for blacks that don&rsquo;t like it here,or-even worse-like it just fine because they can misbehave to their hearts&rsquo; content with little chance of punishment.</p>

<p>Speak for yourself.  It only takes a few &#8220;civilized decent blacks&#8221; to destroy a neighborhood and trigger a selling frenzy.  Detroit was once a place where &#8220;decent civilized blacks&#8221; were allowed into White neighborhoods and look where it got them.  If you have a barrel of mostly rotten apples are you going to dig down into it to find the good ones?  Not likely.  You&rsquo;ve already admitted that even &#8220;decent&#8221; blacks in sufficient numbers have a corrosive effect on a neighborhood.  How can that be if they&rsquo;re &#8220;decent&#8221;?  If there are truly &#8220;decent&#8221; blacks out there they should have no problem banding to together and forming their own community.</p>

		<p>Chas wrote&#8221;That&rsquo;s straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth, so&rsquo;s to speak. There is a book out, authured be a well kwown reporter, her name is Mona something. the book made the times bestseller&rsquo;s list,its called &ldquo;Do-Gooders&rdquo;. the book seems well researched &amp; factual. In said book she says that crime in the black area&rsquo;s was, for the most part not prosecuted before the 1950&rsquo;s, pretty much like dog bites dog who cares?I wonder if that has a bearing on the rampant crime in heavily black area&rsquo;s&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes what she wrote is mostly true. Black on Black crime was not heavily prosecuted before the 1950s. I was not born during that time but have heard various accounts from older relatives and my older friends. Now Black on White crime (that was really low back then) was severely prosecuted. Black people really had no worth in the White man&rsquo;s eyes for the most part so why should they care if they were beat, raped, robbed, or killed. Now I am not bashing any Whites. The vast majority outside the Southern U.S. had so little contact with Blacks before 1960 that they were either ignorant or indifferent to their issues. But as far as the reasons why today the Black crime rate is off the chain is due to people making bad choices, lack of education and effective support services, and the decline of respect for one another&hellip;.oh, and a drug called crack.</p>
<p>I think sometimes crime is condoned because some places have law enforcement in their pocket and many places have lack of cooperation with law enforcement from its citizens due to ignorance and fear. Too much money is being made off the dope game, and many Black thugs use terrorist tactics against people in poor Black neighborhoods.  But again, who outside of the Black &#8220;community&#8221;cares if the elderly Black lady gets ripped off in a Black neighborhood? Who cares if rival dope dealers are shot? </p>
<p>As far as this article, any decent parent would want to do their best to provide their child with a safe environment. If that environments happens to be in a predominately White area then get over it. People have the freedom to live where they can afford to. If they are paying their taxes, not breaking any laws, and not messing with you then why do you care????You do realize that they ARE some low crime, middle-class, Black neighborhoods in several cities.(but I have never heard of one in Pittsburgh.) </p>
<p>Sorry if some of you Whites feel that a Black face in your neighborhood means the doom to all Whites. You claim Blacks are less intelligent then you give them full credit for ruining America. Do you realize how hard it is to institute change in these poor Black communities? So if a working class or middle class family feels the only way their children can succeed is by living in a non-Black area, because they feel they cannot change anything in &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhood can you really fault them? (I can&rsquo;t, just like I cannot fault the Mexicans crossing the border hoping for a better life)You can only hate the game and not the player &amp; hopefully their children will grow up and have better opportunities. A question to anyone. Why are you critical to Blacks that can afford to if they chose to live in an area that happens to be mostly or all White? Have you ever realized maybe it is not about you. Maybe they like the home, location, schools, or want a good return on their investment in the future. Would you want to live around tweakers and dope fiends? No one ever asks Whites to go build a house in Appalachia or Maine where you do not have to see hardly any Blacks if it bothers you so much. Oh wait! You can&rsquo;t, you gotta live in the best place that you can afford just like everyone else.</p>

		<p>I grew up in this same neighbourhood, Beechview, in Pittsburgh. I am now 36 years old. 20 years ago when I was in high school, the first few blacks moved in. I don&rsquo;t think I have to tell my fellow AmRenners what the neighbourhood looks like now. Stores boarded up, shootings on the corner, etc. It breaks my heart. Beechview was such a nice, safe working class area. We kids used to be able to sleep out on our porches in the summertime. All the neighbourhood kids did it. Not any more.

		<p>32 Primavera: The problem with &#8220;good&#8221; Blacks is that they have friends and relatives.  The good ones are the smartest and most decent in their family, which is why they can manage to move to the nice neighborhood and fit in.  But, as the article mentioned, their not-so-good kinsmen come to visit, and some to stay.  How many of these people have good incomes because they have government jobs, awarded them by affirmative action rather than because they have demonstrated competence?  How many are getting Section 8 vouchers, or sub-prime loans?  Most of the Blacks who can afford to move to White suburbs do not earn their money the way the Whites do, rather, it comes to them as a reward for being Black.  Their behavior is little different from the brothers back on the block, and in ten years, the Whites will be gone and the ghetto will have moved in.    </p>

		<p>Primavera, how is a black family moving into a Caucasian neighborhood going to improve their lives? In city after city, time after time, what happens is the neighborhood gets run down with the coming of blacks, the problems they sought to escape appear in their new neighborhoods and they move to another neighborhood, where the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the blacks who moved to Detroit, Gary, Newark NJ and East St. Louis sought a &#8220;better life&#8221;, for themselves and their families. The trouble starts because of what they do once they get settled in their new environs.</p>
<p>The urban decay in the above mentioned cities didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Economic factors were only a part of the story, but the pathological behavior of blacks in these urban environments are mainly responsible for their destruction.</p>

		<p>The problem with living in America today is that it is dangerous to be a poor White person while living in a multicultural poor neighborhood, and most poor neighborhoods are multiculti.  When our country was 95% White and people could sleep with their windows open (e.g., through the 1950s), lower income White Americans could live happy lives in humble neighborhoods with good schools. </p>
<p>Now everyone sacrifices to live in upscale neighborhoods in order to escape crime, antisocial behavior and poor schools, but this takes a huge chunk out of our budgets.  Because of the bad vibes from our disgruntled underclass, mass transit is not as popular as it is in Europe and we all must buy cars.  </p>
<p>The ideal society would be one where we have low crime, mass transit is safe and pleasant, and even the humblest neighborhood is crime-free and friendly.  I wonder sometimes if builders like the idea that Whites have to keep moving to escape crime and the discomfort of being a white minority because it creates the need for them to build new homes every 7 years or so for one family.  The price of safety is $$$$.     </p>

Obama needs to bring home all our troops, order half our ships scuttled into coral reefs,draft every hard leg between 18 and 25, send them to the border and inner cities where we stop dope dealers by shooting them on the spot. Let`s fight the war on drugs like a war. Have our troops escort kids to school and maintain security inside. Turn America into a fortress and tell Alqeda and everybody else to come on over and try to take us out. In 30 days drive by shootings of 5 year old kids will be a bad memmory, crack baby rescue units will close down, the economy will tank and millions will be out of work. However since we have Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska, few will starve. The time for worrying about people`s rights and feelings is over. We kill off the thugs or they will kill us off. If we have to become a police state, resembling North Korea it would be a just penalty from Divine Providence for waging stupid wars and becoming a nation of perverts, drug addicts, and single parent families. The three Gs will rule, God, Guns, and Guts. This is what I`m implying.

		<p>It is every people&rsquo;s God given right to pursue their own destiny and that includes blacks.  Mr. Tiffany it&rsquo;s time for White America to disengage ourselves from the host/parasitic relationship that we&rsquo;ve entangled ourselves in and allow them to make their own choices.  Why should White soldiers or policemen risk their lives or die protecting some worthless piece of crud who&rsquo;s feeding off of us?  Yes, bring the troops home and put them on the border but we must change our Middle East policy to stop the senseless terrorism it fuels.  Put blacks in their own nation or reservation safely away from us and allow them to govern themselves.  Unless you don&rsquo;t believe they are capable of that because they are inferior?  Yes God, guns and guts and lets not be afraid to call out the group that is promoting the war on Christianity, the homosexual agenda, open borders and agitating for another war in the Middle East.

		<p>#31 and #42:  White neighborhoods don&rsquo;t turn bad because a few decent black families join them.  They turn bad later, when too many white families move out instead of standing their ground, and the not-so-decent black families move in.  </p>
<p>American Renaissance is all about fearlessly exposing group differences between whites and non-whites with respect to intelligence and criminal behavior and marriage and childrearing statistics.  I think there are times when acknowledging these differences is morally justifiable, and times when it is not.  It&rsquo;s justifiable when talking about the need to end immigration and affirmative action, or when defending whites against charges of &#8220;structural racism,&#8221; or when seeking to explain why disparities in group performace or phenomena like &#8220;white flight&#8221; exist.  But it&rsquo;s unjustifiable to use knowledge of these differences to judge an individual on the basis of average group characteristics.  Yes, blacks on per capita basis are more likely than whites to be criminals, to be of lower intelligence, and to have other negative traits.  This is valid argument for being cautious wheen dealing with individual blacks, and for discouraging large influxes of blacks into white areas.  It is NOT a valid argument for discriminating against an individual black person before one determines that he or she is not an outlier.  (Not even an outlier   &mdash;   uncivilized blacks still probably make up a MINORITY of black race, however, there are a larger proportion of them among blacks compared to the proportion of the uncivilized or criminals among whites.)</p>
<p>Jared Taylor calls not for color-blindness but instead for free association, which would allow neighborhoods and businesses and schools and employers to exclude the Thomas Sowells and Ezola Fosters and Clarence Thomases and Ward Connerlys from their midst, in addition to the bad blacks.  I have three responses.  First, why would you want to automatically exclude them?  Second, if free association were law, wouldn&rsquo;t the level of blatant anti-white discrimination practiced by elite white institutions, for instance at Ivy League or top tier professional schools, be much worse than it is today?  Third, the fact is that many whites find such prejudice to be morally indefensible.  Indefensible even for those of us who understand that group differences exist, and also understand that people are most comfortable when MOST of the people around them are of the same race.  This is why there was so little sympathy among non-southern whites for the southern white position in the 50s and 60s.  It is one thing to be against affirmative action, or busing, or racial guilt-tripping, or to support &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; as a completely reasonable policing tactic.  It&rsquo;s another thing to be against admitting one or two black kids into a school or onto a team, or one black family into a neighborhood.  Such actions are based on emotion, not reason.  </p>

<p>What you say sounds good in THEORY but it wouldn&rsquo;t play out in real life. You say Whites shouldn&rsquo;t mind a few blacks in their neighbourhoods. The PROBLEM is that A) it takes only a &#8216;few&rsquo; to reach the tipping point when you are dealing with blacks and B) it NEVER STAYS a &#8216;few&rsquo;. (As an extreme example of this consider Detroit. In 1920 Whites were 92.3% and blacks only 7.7% of its population. Can anyone imagine Detroit having those demographics today? Even as late at 1960 Whites still made up 70.2% of its population). Wouldn&rsquo;t a far-sighted, racially aware White in 1920&rsquo;s Detroit have been seen as a &#8220;nut&#8221; for warning about the continuing arrival of Balcks? Just as I was seen as a &#8220;nut&#8221; by my Canadian friends in Toronto in the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s for warning them about non-Whites coming to their city. I would mention that even when you meet or know an occasional black who seems to have their act together, their extended family of cousins, half-siblings, etc will soon drag them down. Blacks can really only escape the squalor and pathology of their own community by severing all ties to it. Few of them are willing to do that. I see no advantage to a White community by having blacks in it.</p>

Any benefit from the good Blacks is overwhelmed by the damage brought by the great mass of typical Blacks, and we need an impenetrable barrier between us.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;This is why there was so little sympathy among non-southern whites for the southern white position in the 50s and 60s. It is one thing to be against affirmative action, or busing, or racial guilt-tripping, or to support &ldquo;racial profiling&rdquo; as a completely reasonable policing tactic. It&rsquo;s another thing to be against admitting one or two black kids into a school or onto a team, or one black family into a neighborhood Such actions are based on emotion, not reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the South, there wasn&rsquo;t just one or two Blacks around but often one third to a majority of a town was Black so a school would end up being half Black. That&rsquo;s what people up North who only had one or two Black families didn&rsquo;t understand. Also, as the above said, Southerners knew that one or two Black families would not stay that way but grow and grow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have no problem living with a small number of non-whites in my midst. </p>
<p>Thankfully, neither do most other whites, including most of those who aren&rsquo;t poisoned with liberalism and self-hate. It comports with white European mores of decency and fair play, something that Jared Taylor talks about, which is NOT a liability as long as it is moderated by common sense. Black people who are genuinely able to assimilate into white society without the aid of affirmative action or sub-prime loans or other racial spoils should be welcomed and encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>You make false blanket assumptions and attempt to flatter us, playing to our egos in an attempt to spoon feed us small doses of multiracialism, integration and multiculturalism.    If these people really are good blacks they should be able to get together and form their own neighborhoods without YT.  They can&rsquo;t because they possess a degenerate quality in them that comes out without the restraints of caucasianism holding them in check.  Up until lately I&rsquo;ve been around blacks all my life, very few good, mostly bad.  Being good means they&rsquo;re tolerable to a point but I wouldn&rsquo;t want them as neighbors.  Just because you and the media hold up certain blacks in esteem doesn&rsquo;t mean the population at large is buying the dog and pony show.  Bill Cosby and Colin Powell would have been on your list last year had it not been for their recent &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; rants.   </p>

<p>The irony is that white people seem to adopt racially conscious attitudes only when forced to live and work in the midst of large numbers of unpleasant non-whites.  Thus, it is doubtful that the all-white or mostly white enclaves that you long for - which in fact exists all over this country in great measure - would be racially conscious, unless there was a huge tremendous educational/propaganda effort to instill such values.  Speaking for my self, growing up in small, nearly all-white college town, having only a handful of non-threatening interracial relationships, I had absolutely no sympathy with pro-white or race realist ideas.  Only when life circumstances brought me to the big multicultural dystopia did this interest awaken.  </p>

		<p>50 White Advocate, you&rsquo;re right about Whites being unsympathetic to race realism.  The military began to open my eyes, followed by the Great Alien Invasion.  I used to think that Southerners were the nastiest people on Earth until one of them set me straight about the trouble I was walking into by hanging with Blacks.  The signs were there, but I refused to see them.  A thank you to the good ol&rsquo; boys, for stopping me from going downtown on Saturday night to go drinking with my new Black friends.  </p>

		<p>White Advocate I suppose it&rsquo;s just a coincidence that people are moving to areas that are overwhelmingly White?  Being around people of your own kind is natural and instinctive and doesn&rsquo;t require any sort of educational propaganda effort.  So you&rsquo;ve been in interracial relationships?  The more you talk the less you sound like a White advocate or maybe you mean a different kind of white?</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor calls not for color-blindness but instead for free association, which would allow neighborhoods and businesses and schools and employers to exclude the Thomas Sowells and Ezola Fosters and Clarence Thomases and Ward Connerlys from their midst, in addition to the bad blacks. I have three responses. First, why would you want to automatically exclude them? </p>
<p>How about the fact that it just maintains the status quo we are already suffering under?  A few blacks in our neighborhood, a few blacks in the subdivision next door, in fact, a few blacks in every neighborhood within a 20 mile radius.  That is what you want, isn&rsquo;t it?  Hundreds or thousands of blacks concentrated in White suburbia. Their children going to our schools working their magic to destroy the learning environment and the school&rsquo;s standing in the community.  When the schools fail, some people will move to other areas with better districts.  The empty house in the neighborhood with a few blacks becomes less attractive to White families looking to buy a home because the school system sucks.  The house will likely go to a colored person and thus the disintegration of the neighborhood begins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, if free association were law, wouldn&rsquo;t the level of blatant anti-white discrimination practiced by elite white institutions, for instance at Ivy League or top tier professional schools, be much worse than it is today?&#8221;</p>
<p>This sounds like a threat.  Of course, I would expect our hostile alien elites to retaliate if White America started to  rail against their wishes for self determination.  We need to take back our institutions, universities and political parties.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Third, the fact is that many whites find such prejudice to be morally indefensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact is most people do not.  It&rsquo;s obvious if you look at the pattern of segregation in the US. They may not admit it publicly but actions speak louder than words. I hear people in the media using the same argument that it&rsquo;s morally indefensible not to allow same sex couples to get married or adopt children.  The people vomiting out this tripe don&rsquo;t have any sense of morality themselves.  Self determination and freedom are God given rights.   <br>
