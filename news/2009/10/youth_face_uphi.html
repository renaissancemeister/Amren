<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091017/US.Detroit.Youth.Left.Behind/">Youth Face Uphill Struggle Amid Detroit&rsquo;s Troubles</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, Comcast News, October 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Like the rundown houses and shuttered storefronts in his Detroit neighborhood, bleakness abounds in LeRoy Taylor&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>He is among tens of thousands reaching adulthood in a city where the American Dream appears just outside their reach. Taylor, 20, spends empty hours on basketball courts, zoned out in front of a television or aimlessly pedaling through streets he desperately wants to leave, but doesn&rsquo;t have the work skills, education or money to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fill out applications. No one will call me back,&#8221; said Taylor, stopping his bike long enough to hustle change for cigarettes near a west side bus stop. &#8220;It&rsquo;s useless. It&rsquo;s real scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too few jobs are only part of the problems facing youths in this troubled city. Its public high schools are considered among the nation&rsquo;s worst. Planned budget cuts to the recreation department will reduce hours and slash into staffing.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s crime.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old and his mother were charged Wednesday with murder after a 19-year-old bystander was shot to death at a recreation center. The county prosecutor said the 35-year-old woman allowed her son access to a handgun and drove him away after the shooting.</p>
<p>Five other 15-year-olds were among six teens arrested earlier this month for as many as 10 armed robberies and carjackings. And in late June, seven teens were wounded during a bus stop shooting after summer school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 32 percent of the city&rsquo;s 900,000 residents struggle in poverty as Detroit limps through the auto industry&rsquo;s collapse. Factory and manufacturing jobs are gone.</p>
<p>Roughly one in four working-age adults is jobless. The situation is more dire for 16- to 19-year-olds in Detroit who face an unemployment rate of 57.4 percent, according to the state Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, citing last year&rsquo;s U.S. Census figures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until a few months ago, Detroit Cares was known as the Last Chance Academy for students who failed in traditional school settings. The privately run academy, under contract with Detroit Public Schools, receives its funding from the district. Traditional courses are taught alongside cosmetology, building trades and culinary arts.</p>
<p>Detroit high school students historically have done poorly on standardized tests. For example, 32 percent of 11th graders met or exceeded reading standards and only 14 percent did the same in math on the 2007 Michigan Merit Examination. Statewide averages were 60 percent in reading and 47 percent in math.</p>
<p>District records show fewer than six of 10 high school seniors graduated in 2008, while the dropout rate was just over 27 percent.</p>
<p>An emergency financial manager appointed in March by Gov. Jennifer Granholm is restructuring the schools to improve education and student safety while trying to reduce a $259 million budget deficit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think college preparation is the cornerstone of Detroit Public Schools anymore,&#8221; said Sheffield, the founder and chief executive of Detroit Cares. &#8220;The vast majority of these kids are looking for a high school diploma and to get jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But money is in short supply in Detroit.</p>
<p>About 7,000 young people were employed under a summer jobs program, but its funding ran out. Recreation center hours, threatened with new reductions, have been cut to help trim the city&rsquo;s $300 million budget deficit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;College prep not &ldquo;the cornerstone of Detroit Public Schools.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What good would college do any of them if they are given free grades and a degree under AA?</p>
<p>I mean, they still can&rsquo;t read their certification.  Well, maybe some of it, like &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;of,&#8221; and &#8220;is.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an education, they&rsquo;ll just turn out like Henry Gates.  You know, that brilliant black &#8220;scholar&#8221; who, when asked to go outside to talk by the cop on the scene, replied, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll see yo mama outside.&#8221;  I imagine he&rsquo;s the pride of Harvard.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;About 32 percent of the city&rsquo;s 900,000 residents struggle in poverty as Detroit limps through the auto industry&rsquo;s collapse. Factory and manufacturing jobs are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how can this be, how can this be?</p>
<p>Why with a city over 90% black and most of &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; whitey&rsquo;s influences purged from its neighborhoods and thoroughfares, replaced with more dynamically naturalistic Afrocentric perspectives, the city should just be thriving. The murders and other crimes, are not endemic or epidemic; they are simply the exaggerated anti-black phantasms of the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; local and national media. </p>
<p>So I was told my entire life, by the very same local and national media in question!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, all of the little hooting LeRoys and yowling JaBoonyas, and their parents before them, in that city have done this to themselves. They have done nothing since 1967 but thrive on their arrogant ignorance and hatred of white Michiganders. They have repeatedly elected Communists and criminals (and what is the difference there really) and demanded endlessly, as if through some cosmic juju, that they excessively tax the auto companies and other industries stupid enough to stay in the city, into making them &ldquo;equal&rdquo; to the whites they so flamboyantly hate. </p>
<p>Now, the chickens have come home to roost and most of the pigeons have flown the coop!</p>
<p><br/>
End of story!!!<br/>

		<p>This is a joke - right! Let&rsquo;s see, we have a 20 yr. old BABBY-DADDIE [ 4yr. old baby, do the math ] that dropped out of school due to &#8220;lack of wanting to go to school&#8221; who spends his time &#8220;on basketball courts, zoned out in front of a television or aimlessly pedaling through streets he desperately wants to leave&#8221; and lives with his mother - a true prize to alot of clueless White women I&rsquo;m sure.<br/>
Then we have another parasite that&rsquo;s a 19yr. old BABY-MOMMA [ no mention of a BABY-DADDIE!! ] that got kicked out of school for &#8220;fighting&#8221; and lives with her mother. These idiots don&rsquo;t have a clue that it is THEM and thousands like them that Detroit is Detroit. That &#8220;he could be accomplishing something&#8221; by getting out of Detroit is sadly laughable because where ever he goes, Detroit goes. It would be like trying to run away from your shadow. The only thing he will probably ever &#8220;accomplish&#8221; is breed more welfare dependents with countless babby-mommas [most of them White if he leaves Detoit]. <br/>
Last but not least we have the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Sheffield a &#8220;LONGTIME community activist&#8221; who says - &#8220;If there&rsquo;s no viable options available, no legitimate sources of revenue, that often causes people to resort to crime.&#8221; Why, if he&rsquo;s been there a long time, hasn&rsquo;t HE provided those things to his community! Just what does a &#8220;community activist&#8221; do besides shake down Whitey!<br/>
Just reading about these three speaks volumns as to why Detroit is the way it is and where the rest of the country will be going, because there are MILLIONS more of them all over country.<br/>

		<p>These Denizens of Detroit have voted the straight Democrat Party ticket since living memory began.</p>
<p>The jobs in Detroit have been shipped overseas.</p>
<p>By who?  Oh, yeah, the Dems.</p>
<p>Their Savior, Hussian, will continue to ship more American jobs overseas.</p>
<p>And they will continue to vote for him and them.</p>
<p>And they will continue to search for non-existent jobs.</p>
<p>And they will continue to vote&hellip;to search&hellip;to vote&hellip;to search&hellip;</p>
<p>In Logic Tree talk, they have created a self-limiting, self-defeating, closed loop system.</p>
<p>Detroit is approaching its vanishing point. </p>

		<p>The article moans and groans that it is so hard for that teenager to find a job.  The unspoken assumption being that his plight is a direct result of his being black.  Well I&rsquo;ve got news for the author: it is very difficult these days for WHITE teenagers to find jobs too!  Nevertheless, if LeRoy is spending hours in front of his television, why does he not turn to a channel where standard English is spoken and practice speaking like that in front of a mirror for about 20 minutes a day.  That simple exercise would do wonders for his chances at getting a job.  Next, let him spend the same amount of time in ruthless introspection.  Let him write down his personality traits (the ones pertinent to performance on the job).  Let him ask himself: Am I responsible and prompt?  Do I have a good work ethic?  Am I honest in admitting my mistakes and owning up to them?  Do I treat other people with respect?  Am I polite?  Am I eager to learn new skills?  If the answer to any of those questions is &#8220;no&#8221;, then he&rsquo;s already got a job.  That job is improving himself to the point where he&rsquo;s marketable in the wider job market.</p>

     Well, yes you are right, and then again, in a sense you are wrong. Yes to putting away the basketball, turning off the tv and studying his textbooks, but wrong about how easy it will be to get a job then. Things have changed dramatically. Our local newspaper might now carry ads for 3 or 4 jobs each day, where in the past years there were 1 or 2 PAGES of jobs listed. Not even school bus driver jobs (which used to be there all the time) are listed because even those (crummy) jobs have been taken by the vast number of unemployed (many of whom have degrees, as well as there HS diploma). This is not to excuse the sloth of the black kid we are talking about here, merely to point out today&rsquo;s reality. I have no doubt that if times were still good he would still have a hard time finding a job. But&hellip; for the past 40 years or so, high schools have done away completely with the trade schools (no metalworking shop, no woodworking shop; don&rsquo;t even dream about being a machinist-they don&rsquo;t teach it anymore) instead they emphasize &#8220;going to college&#8221; for 90% of the student body. This is not only unrealistic, it is downright stupidity. College was always for the &#8220;above average&#8221; in the early part of the last century, when we still embraced reality. Has reality changed? Are 90% of today&rsquo;s students &#8220;above average&#8221; and/or &#8220;college material? The point is; there is little in the way of decent jobs for the majority of kids who will always be &#8220;average&#8221;. And to make matters worse, those very few students who are &#8220;gifted&#8221; are largely ignored and lumped in with the rest of the student body which includes &#8220;slower&#8221; kids (as if the slower ones were magically going to benefit by their forced association with the bright ones). To sum it all up; there can be no &#8220;healthy economy&#8221; in a nation with no manufacturing industry. And laws to prevent corporations from robbing the American people of their industry by moving production overeas to take advantage of 30 cent an hour wages should have been enacted long ago. We can&rsquo;t have a decent standard of living if the only options for employment are washing each others clothes and working in group homes.</p>

		<p>I know the perfect cure for all the young black men who can make babies find crack but not jobs. We need to start up the Obama Legion. Force all black hoodlem punks into the army`s special,&#8221; Dirty 5 Million Man,&#8221; battle group. They show up deep in the Alaskan heartland where they begin mountain warfare training. They are free to go if they can`t get along without hos and crack or the top kicks are racists. They can walk out the gate and find their way back to the hood after hiking out of 1000 miles of frozen wilderness.After 2 years of such training, including a stint at Death Valley and after the government deducts most of their pay for baby`s momma, we can turn them loose on the Taliban with the carrot that they can run the smack business if the Afghans are wied out. When they come back as heroes, they will be a far different breed of cat. Filthy rich in the opium trade. After about half are killed by the Afghans or each  other, we will have solved all our problems in the inner cities. On to Kabul and glory.<br/>

<p>Racism is the root behind any and all problems in the world. Weren&rsquo;t you listening in school? Obviously more blacks and latinos need to move to Detroit to get rid of all the racism there.</p>
