<h1><a href="http://news.aol.com/article/ucla-students-throat-slashed-in/710649">Instructors Rushed to Help Stab Victim</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Watkins, AOL News, October 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blood gushed from a student&rsquo;s neck and formed a puddle on the floor of a UCLA lab as instructors struggled to stanch the wound.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old woman was taken across the hall after being slashed in the neck by a classmate, and two staff members quickly applied pressure and put gauze on the wound. Stunned students watched in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her eyes rolled back in her head, I called out her name and told her to stay with me. She wasn&rsquo;t really responding. I think she could hear me,&#8221; said chemistry lecturer Stacie Nakamoto, whose lab the victim was brought into.</p>
<p>The victim, who Nakamoto and police would not identify, went to the hospital in critical condition. On Friday, her family released a statement saying she was showing signs of improvement and was expected to recover.</p>
<p>Damon D. Thompson, 20, was arrested shortly after the attack and booked for investigation of attempted murder.</p>
<p>Immediately after the attack, he walked into the student information center three floors below.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very calm and said he had stabbed someone,&#8221; said Carol Verduzco, an administrative assistant who works in the office.</p>
<p>She said she asked if he was joking and then she called the police. Thompson waited in a chair for the few minutes it took police to arrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in shock,&#8221; Verduzco said, noting she saw no blood on Thompson.</p>
<p>Los Angeles police detectives were interviewing witnesses to try to establish a motive for the attack. Thompson and the victim were not romantically involved, Detective Mike Pelletier said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s relatives said he is an only child who left his mother&rsquo;s home in Belize two years ago to attend UCLA. His second cousin, 17-year-old Akilah Williams, said she was skeptical that Thompson was capable of the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;He cares about what people think about him too much,&#8221; Williams told the Los Angeles Times. &#8220;He gets stressed out but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;d do something crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witnesses said the attack left the blood-drenched woman dazed and near fainting.</p>
<p>Los Angeles police said Friday the woman was stabbed several times. They would not say what weapon was used or if the victim was stabbed anywhere besides the neck.</p>

		<p>A scroungy, homeless black man stabbed a Moroccan 11 year old boy nearly to death and he has not been apprehended or even identified on a San Francisco Municipal Railway bus two weeks ago.The SF bus system has for decades been to blacks a series of opportunities on wheels to assault, terrorize, and intimidate non blacks, especially whites for generations now.They dislike immigrants as much as they dislike us. </p>

		<p>It is almost impossible for an excellent white male student to gain acceptance to UCLA.  That much is a fact.  But they seem to have no trouble admitting mentally deranged black foreigners at  white taxpayers expense.  It has been reported that this honor student was &#8220;known&#8221; to college authorities because of bizarre and threatening behavior in several classes.  Of course this was suppressed much like the Virginia Tech shooter&rsquo;s behavior.  I have stated before that college campuses are much more unsafe than the public believes, especially for women.  The amount of black predators, students or otherwise that have access to college campuses make it that way.   </p>

		<p>Looks like yet another black perpetrator. Of course the MS news media does not want to publicize that part of the story but when it was a White man it was on 24/7.</p>

		<p>A UCLA prof had warned the administration about the black assailant almost a year ago:</p>
<p>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,563821,00.html</p>
<p>The assailant&rsquo;s relatives discount the possibility that he could be guilty.  </p>
<p>Since the suspect is black, I am guessing that this story will not get much play in the media. </p>

		<p>The common denominators: (a) it happened in California (UCLA); (b) the perp is an immigrant.</p>
<p>So the question remains: How WELL are potential immigrants screened? For mental health issues&hellip; for criminal histories?</p>

		<p>Re: the Fox link in Comment #7, I don&rsquo;t believe for ONE SECOND that that kid was taunted, especially in history classes.  I am an alumna of UCLA, &amp; nobody picks on kids.  Everyone keeps to themselves, because they&rsquo;re busy competing against a vicious curve.  </p>
<p>The history classes are larded with the stupid athletes anyways - because history classes are mostly scheduled in the morning before they must go to practice.  There are a few bright students, but it&rsquo;s mostly the athletes icing their knees and Persians cheating.  Everyone is too self-involved to care about this kid.</p>
<p>Maybe he is a paranoid schizophrenic &amp; hears voices.  It seems like a silly excuse.</p>

		<p>@ UnTel: This story will stay alive.  The UCLA community is vocal.  Actually, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s an open campus (property of the State) and so politically alive that I&rsquo;m surprised there have not been larger, more violent clashes more often.</p>
<p>This stabbing shook everyone.  I was in Westwood, down in the Village that day, &amp; I remember the sirens and the ambulances and cops suddenly racing toward campus.  Ambulances go up to the hospital all the time, but when it&rsquo;s a few, and many cops, you know it&rsquo;s bad.  Also, everyone was talking about it all of a sudden.  </p>
<p>When there is an imminent threat on campus, all the department heads and counselors send out e-mails to their list serves warning students to stay away from a sealed off area.  For how huge UCLA is, and how diverse, such instances are miraculously rare.  When something happens, nobody forgets very soon.  </p>
<p>What the media has not reported as widely is that there was a recent stabbing at a frat as well.  Gang members tried to show up for free beer and when they declined to be carded, a fist fight turned into a stabbing.  <br>

		<p>A crime may be a topic of conversation on the local level but, to be on the national radar, there has to be coverage by the mainstream media. My point is that if this is a case of dog bites man (an unstable black acting out his hatred of others), then this is not the kind of story that the cable news channels will want to beat like a dead horse. It doesn&rsquo;t fit their script like the Annie Le murder.</p>

		<p>My clinical experience tells me that he was most probably Schizophrenic. However, mentally ill people are generally not held unaccountable by courts- they usually seek treatment and then discontinue AMA. They know what they are doing when they discontinue. Thank goodness, most judges have a good understanding of this. I think this attack is a good argument toward border enforcement as other nations will seek to rid themselves of their problematic citizens- I must admit that even where I work, when we hear that a troublesome client has moved out of our area, we rejoice.</p>

		<p>However, you notice that these so-called crazy people usually attack someone weaker like a kid or a woman, usually not some young,strong and large man. So I wonder how crazy they really are?</p>

		<p>Per UN data, the number of MURDERS per 100,000 of population is 30.1   &mdash;   So this would-be killer is not all that different from his former countrymen.</p>
