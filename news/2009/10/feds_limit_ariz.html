<h1>Feds Limit Arizona Sheriff&rsquo;s Immigration Powers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacques Billeaud, Buffalo News, October 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arizona sheriff known for aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration has been stripped of some of his special power to enforce federal immigration law, and he claims the Obama administration is taking away his authority for political reasons.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose office faces racial profiling allegations over crime and immigration sweeps in some heavily Latino areas of metro Phoenix, said officials from Washington won&rsquo;t let him renew a deal that let his deputies make federal immigration arrests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them all go brag that they took away the sheriff&rsquo;s authority. Let them all do that. That doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I don&rsquo;t have an ego. I will continue doing the same thing,&#8221; the Republican sheriff said, noting he can still enforce state immigration laws. &#8220;What has changed, other than the politics and the perception emanating from Washington?&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. government, which does most of the nation&rsquo;s immigration enforcement, is changing its rules for allowing local police to enforce more expansive federal immigration laws. Nationally, more than 1,000 local police and jail officers have been granted the power since 2002 to make immigration requests and speed up deportations.</p>
<p>Arpaio has more officers with the special powers than any other local police agency in the country. For more than two years, 100 of his deputies have made immigration arrests and another 60 jail officers have identified inmates who are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Even though federal officials declined to let the sheriff keep making immigration arrests, Arpaio last week renewed a deal that will let his jail officers determine inmates&rsquo; immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vinnie Picard, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which grants the special powers, declined to comment on the curtailment of Arpaio&rsquo;s powers or whether any of the other 62 participating local agencies across the country have been denied renewals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For his part, Arpaio said he plans to continue cracking down illegal immigration by enforcing state laws that prohibit immigrant smuggling and ban employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Arpaio said his deputies can still detain suspected illegal immigrants who haven&rsquo;t committed state crimes, as long as his officers call Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to pick them up.</p>
<p>Critics say some of Arpaio&rsquo;s deputies racially profiled people during immigration sweeps. Arpaio maintains that people pulled over in the sweeps were approached because deputies had probable cause to believe they had committed crimes.</p>

		<p>Well, here&rsquo;s a new low for this administration.  Preventing a local police force from enforcing the law. They&rsquo;re getting more brazen and walking further into dangerous territory every day.</p>
<p>Sheriff Joe has the audacity to insist that one of the empire&rsquo;s privileged racial groups obey the law the same as everyone else, and since Arizona is supposed to be a sovereign entity, this matter has edged over into a constitutional issue.  </p>
<p>There is no federal law that he is in violation of, but there are federal laws covering sanctuary cities, yet we hear not a peep from the empire&rsquo;s architects of white hatred about that issue.</p>
<p>The messiah&rsquo;s fools are giving this growing multimillion anti-big-government, patriot resistance group more reasons to bring even more grief on them than they would normally. </p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t necessary to go into great detail about what they&rsquo;re doing wrong to gain opposition to them.  They stupidly provide open evidence all on their own.</p>
<p>After learning more about the flakes, oddballs, and misfits in power, it&rsquo;s apparent to me that this administration&rsquo;s apointees and hires are LaLa land freaks.  They openly provide oulandish evidence of what they want and what they believe, because all their lives they&rsquo;ve travelled only in circles where nobody is aware of what &#8220;weird&#8221; means, because to them, weird is the norm.  That explains why they think tea party patriots are people who are demonic terrorists.</p>
<p>Enforcing the law against their empire&rsquo;s privileged class, to people like these, is something done by fringe groups.</p>

		<p>In a homogeneous society, it would be obvious who does not belong there; anybody could tell just by looking at him.  This is one reason, out of many, that multiracial societies are a bad idea.  A multiracial society must make a choice if it wishes to protect its borders: a) allow racial profiling so that authorities can more easily identify invaders or b) don&rsquo;t allow racial profiling and hope that, somehow, the invaders will expose themselves.  Granted, this is a simplistic way of looking at it, but this is what it boils down to in our case.  </p>

		<p>Sheriff Joe doesn&rsquo;t report to the &#8220;Feds&#8221;.  He reports to the people of his County   &mdash;   the people who Elected him to be Sheriff.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Feds&#8221; have zero jurisdiction over him and over any other Sheriff, for that matter, including the cowardly ones who think that when the &#8220;Feds&#8221; tell them to jump that they must then ask &#8220;how high?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The man has an excellent way with words, he should be a politician, not a sheriff.</p>

<p>A hispanic sitting outside of home depot or one that doesn&rsquo;t speak english perfectly might be an illegal immigrant, both are very suspicious things.  Being an illegal immigrant is the same as being a criminal, as you had to commit a crime to get here.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Arpaio is a politician, as the Office of Sheriff is elective.  Having said that, he probably has done more damage to the establishment&rsquo;s machine than he could have by being a congressman, or even govenor.  He is certainly an inspiration and example to the rest of us.<br>
This nonsense that only the Feds have the right to enforce immigration law is just that.  Local authorities routinely enforce all kinds of federal laws; why not immigration?</p>

<p>Right, perhaps Arizona should stop enforcing Counterfeiting laws and allow it in their state, the funny money would be equally valuable to us as our real money.</p>
