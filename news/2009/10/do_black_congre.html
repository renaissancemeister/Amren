<h1><a href="https://www.thegrio.com/2009/10/all-eyes-are-on-rep.php">Do Black Congressmen Still Represent Black Interests?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlton McIlwain, The Grio, October 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All eyes are on Rep. Charlie Rangel again this week as finger-pointing Republicans continue to pursue punishing him for ethics violations. {snip} Rangel&rsquo;s financial woes may likely have far-reaching and negative implications not only for him, but the people he first came to Congress to represent.</p>
<p>Congressman William Clay, Sr. once claimed, &#8220;Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.&#8221; As a fellow founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), this statement characterized not only Congressman Rangel&rsquo;s political beliefs, but defined his fundamental mission: to represent the underrepresented political interests of black Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem, though  &mdash;  as some see it  &mdash;  is that when they were few, folks like Rangel were black politicians  &mdash;  politicians whose mission was shaped by their fidelity to the racial group to which they belonged. Now that they are many, some say they have become nothing more than politicians who just so happen to be black, placing their own, personal and primarily financial interests above those to be served. Some would say that the black interests of 1971 have taken a backseat to the personal interests of individual black congressmen and women of this millennium.</p>
<p>For instance, almost one-third of CBC members were considered &#8220;underachievers&#8221; or &#8220;derelict&#8221; in a 2006 report by the Black Congressional Monitor, a progressive interest group which tracks the legislative initiatives of black congressmen and women. From stash-of-cash-in-my-fridge William Jefferson, to former Congressman Al Wynn, Bobby Rush and others once criticized for selling their votes to the powerful telecommunications lobby, the group castigated many on the CBC&rsquo;s roster for putting their own interests first. The best interests of their black constituents or civil rights causes came second, they claimed.</p>
<p>The accuracy of such a report is only one thing to consider. More importantly, we must consider the fact that there is a growing perception that today&rsquo;s black politicians aren&rsquo;t the democratic defenders of the race many once saw them as.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once there is widespread perception that black representatives are no different than typical politicians, it&rsquo;s only a hop, skip and a jump to the conclusion that black politicians no longer serve the purpose they once did of safeguarding black interests. Add to this the fact that over the past decade or so, many black politicians who rely on white voters&rsquo; support have gone out of their way to make the case that they can represent whites&rsquo; interests, despite the fact that they are black. {snip}</p>
<p>In concert with other factors, on one hand Rangel&rsquo;s financial woes erode the perception of legitimacy regarding the special representative function of black representatives in today&rsquo;s legislative landscape. On the other, we&rsquo;ve seen the transformation of the black politician from a mere local, race-constrained representative, to one who could be president. Together, these realities seem to powerfully undermine the underlying principle  &mdash;  that blacks can best, and therefore should, represent other blacks  &mdash;  behind using racial gerrymandering as a tool to increase black representation.</p>
<p>Republicans have opposed the practice of drawing seats to secure the adequate numerical representation of blacks and other people of color for years. But the most recent debates questioning the principle behind the practice have taken place among Democrats. One was the fight that erupted in 2006, when Brooklyn City Councilman David Yassky ran for retiring Congressman Major Owens&rsquo; seat (one of the original gerrymandered safe black districts). The other began in the same year when Steve Cohen  &mdash;  a White Jewish man  &mdash;  successfully challenged a number of black hopefuls for the Tennessee congressional seat vacated by Harold Ford, Jr. The same debate, over the same seat, continues at this moment as a new black prospect  &mdash;  former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton  &mdash;  seeks to correct what he sees as the district&rsquo;s racial wrongs.</p>
<p>In the mounting debate over and undermining of the principle of racial gerrymandering, Republicans will likely see a golden opportunity to justify diluting the concentrations of blacks and other minorities in the looming redistricting battles soon to occur as we approach the end of the decade. This would be a blow to the principle of equal representation, as some of us interpret it.</p>
<p>{snip} [Be] careful when you claim to  &mdash;  quite literally  &mdash;  represent the race, because you might do so in ways you never intended.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Do Black Congressmen Still Represent Black Interests?&#8221;</p>
<p>How utterly preposterous.</p>
<p>Of course they do.  They represent nothing BUT black interests.  The Black Caucus and ALL of the black leadership are concerned ONLY with blacks and black interests, and not only in this country but throughout the entire world.  Non-black fellow countrymen mean nothing to these selfish, arrogant, fools. They are more concerned with a black in Kenya or Uganda than they are a white in America.</p>
<p>Have you ever known of a black to concern himself with anything that affects whites?  Me neither.  And, the sad fact of the matter is that you never will.  Yet they have the nerve to accuse whites of being uncaring.  Disgusting.</p>
<p>Blacks are jealous and resentful of whites, white intelligence, and white accomplishments.  Not only will that hateful attitude fail to improve, but it will get worse, as it is doing right now.</p>
<p>Critical mass will be reached.</p>

		<p><i>Congressman William Clay, Sr. once claimed, &ldquo;Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a fine one to talk.  Clay Sr. was so lazy that he wouldn&rsquo;t bother to help down missing social security checks for his old black constituents.  The congressman from the neighboring district to the west, one Bob Young, a conservative Democrat, would often pick up the slack.  And those weren&rsquo;t even his constituents, nor the kind of people that would have voted for him.</p>
<p>Clay&rsquo;s son, William &#8220;Lacy&#8221; (aka Lazy) Clay, Jr., now sits in that seat.</p>
<p><i>Republicans have opposed the practice of drawing seats to secure the adequate numerical representation of blacks and other people of color for years.</i></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>In the mounting debate over and undermining of the principle of racial gerrymandering, Republicans will likely see a golden opportunity to justify diluting the concentrations of blacks and other minorities in the looming redistricting battles soon to occur as we approach the end of the decade.

<p>They&rsquo;re talking about the racially gerrmandered districts of the 80s and 90s.  Those were the best thing that ever happened to the Stupid Party, and of course the Stupid Party would push to eliminate them.  Take a hint, Republican geniuses:  If you clump up black voters into their own house seats, then white liberals can&rsquo;t beat white conservatives in the lily white districts, because there is no reliable black voter base.  That&rsquo;s why the Rs won the House in 1994.  And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why they lost it in 2006, and will never regain it.<br>

		<p>They may have begun representing their own race when blacks first started holding the offices, but now they don&rsquo;t represent anyone but themselves, and haven&rsquo;t for many, many years. So sorry to burst blacks&rsquo; bubbles, but politicians of any color are arrogant, greedy shysters with virtually no conscience, no morals and an overwhelming sense of entitlement.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly, and I might add that the reason Hispanics taking black jobs is ignored by the black leadership is because they hate whitey so much more than anything else they overlook the loss of jobs, because they perceive that adding non-whites to the country will reduce the white power base, and that&rsquo;s the most important goal in the world to them.  Hatred taints their judgement and decisions as much as their lack of intellect.</p>
<p>If we ever make it through this economic fiasco without an internal armed conflict, we will be about two rungs below Brazilian society with chaos, robberies, muggings and kidnappings, that will make Rio seem like a staunch law and order society.</p>

		<p>I think a lot of middle Americans now realize that a Black politician is ipso facto no different than any other politician   &mdash;   and probably worse.  </p>
<p>The rankest ineptitude; and for example, like here in Philadelphia the foulest type of corrupt/kickback-scam, Democratic machine race hustler is the norm.  And now everybody is starting to notice.  </p>

		<p>In all fairness it must be said that there are hardly any white politicians who represent white interests.  Indeed, nearly all would be offended at the suggestion that they *should* defend white interests.</p>

		<p>a little off topic, but the members of the CBC are paid $10,000 over and above their reg congressional salary, simply for belonging to the CBC. isn&rsquo;t this a violation of federal law? groups are barred from receiving fed money if they practice discrimination based on race, which clearly the CBC does</p>

		<p>&#8220;Will make Rio (De Janerio)seem like a staunch law and order society&#8221; I went to Rio back in the early to mid 1980`s. I still remember the travel ads of a woman who had been dancing all night in a ball gown and diamond necklace walking on the beach at dawn with  her shoes in her hand. And the  stark reality of groups of  11 year old boys hitting tourists across the head with pieces of 2x4`s. But I`m glad to see the truth about it has finally come out. It gives me hope that other lies about people and places will be revealed to be concealed by the mass media. I also recall the sadness of the apology by my cabbie who said, &#8220;I`m sorry we`re not the kind of place you thought we were.&#8221;  And how he faced down a group of thugs on my behalf by telling them in Portuguese I was his sucker and his alone. Thanks cowboy, what ever your name was&hellip;</p>

		<p>You mean Black Congressmen should be working to BETTER conditions for Black Americans as opposed to setting themselves up for a cushy future when voted out of office? Wow! What a novel idea.</p>
<p>Wondering just how many Black Congressmen (or senators) happen to follow the example set by Louisana Democrat, William Jefferson&hellip; convicted of bribery and influence peddling. For lump sums of &#8220;cold cash&#8221; found in his freezer at home.</p>

<p>A succinct but super-accurate description of Blacks, world-wide. But Africans had never really accomplished a darn thing before White Europeans started exploring and colonizing the Dark Continent. That Black History Myth (I mean &#8220;month) was created by liberals soley to try to make it appear Blacks were anything but lazy underachievers in their own right. Even to the extent of downplaying White accomplishments and letting unaware students draw the erroneous conclusion other races than the White Europeans and Americans made the benefits of today&rsquo;s civilization possible.</p>
<p>What the average White high school student does NOT get taught&hellip; that comparing White achievements and accomplishments over the past 5,000 years to the Great Pyramid&hellip; the accomplishments of Orientals would be a large boulder, the accomplishments of Africans a grain of sand in comparison.</p>

<p>I disagree.  If the black leadership really cared about black welfare, would they have whistled past the graveyard of mass immigration as long as they have?  Blacks are the first displaced by the third world masses.</p>
<p><i>Yet they have the nerve to accuse whites of being uncaring. Disgusting.</i> </p>
<p>Maybe, but it works.  The part I find disgusting is that whites put up with the nonsense.  Oh, that, and most of the nonsense is coming from other whites.</p>
<p><i>Blacks are jealous and resentful of whites, white intelligence, and white accomplishments. Not only will that hateful attitude fail to improve, but it will get worse, as it is doing right now.</i></p>
<p>Human nature.  Every class of people naturally resents its betters, or those with more ability.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the obsession here with blacks is a real bore.  I wonder if even half the Amren commentariat protests the impending dominion of their Asian masters.</p>
