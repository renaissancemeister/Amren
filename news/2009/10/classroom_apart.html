			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Bracchi, Daily Mail (London), October 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He gave his name as Henry Webster when he stepped into the witness box at the High Court in London last week. But he wasn&rsquo;t the Henry Webster his family and friends remember.</p>
<p>The real Henry Webster was a strapping 6ft 2in rugby player, not someone who struggled to string sentences together and had to be given painkillers to complete his evidence.</p>
<p>Instead of preparing for college or university, he has been left with learning difficulties, short-term memory loss, and epilepsy. Henry will settle for that because the alternative would have meant not being here at all.</p>
<p>This is the only upside of being attacked with a claw hammer that left an inch-deep impression on his skull.</p>
<p>One claw hammer and 12 teenage thugs versus one young man. Those were the odds when a gang of Asian youths ambushed him.</p>
<p>After their work was done, his attackers punched the air in triumph  &mdash;  &#8216;that&rsquo;s what you call Paki bashing,&rsquo; they yelled.</p>
<p>The thugs have all been jailed. Not all the culprits, however, have been brought to book  &mdash;  not in the eyes of Henry&rsquo;s family, anyway. They believe teachers at his school, near Swindon  &mdash;  where the assault took place in 2007 when Henry was just 15  &mdash;  are as guilty as the actual perpetrators themselves.</p>
<p>Why? Because, they say, the school allowed ethnic minority pupils to get away with flagrant misbehaviour, and then handed them less severe punishments than their white classmates because staff feared they might otherwise be accused of racism.</p>
<p>In other words, a culture of &rsquo; educational apartheid&rsquo; prevailed in all but name at Ridgeway School.</p>
<p>Had this not been the case, Henry&rsquo;s parents insist, their son would probably not have sustained brain damage outside the school tennis courts one day in January nearly three years ago.</p>
<p>Wasif Khan, 18, outside Bristol Crown Court, where he is charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on Henry Webster in an attack on a tennis court at Ridgeway School in Wroughton, Wiltshire</p>
<p>They have now brought a civil action against Ridgeway and are seeking compensation of up to Â£1 million. The allegations amount to a devastating indictment not just of Ridgeway, but of policies that were supposed to lead to integration, not segregation, in our schools.</p>
<p>Our own investigation into the events which culminated in Henry Webster being left for dead within walking distance of his classroom does little to counter that view.</p>
<p>Remember, this is not some inner city hell hole. Swindon (population 200,000) is often used for market research purposes precisely because it is considered to be a typical British town; neither the best nor the worst place to live, just average.</p>
<p>Ridgeway School, too, is average. Only about 70  &mdash;  5 per cent  &mdash;  of the 1,400 or so pupils are from ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Exam results are good, and the school continues to receive glowing government reports. Only last year, Ridgeway&rsquo;s headmaster Steven Colledge, who took over in September 2006, was praised by Ofsted inspectors as &#8216;Outstanding&rsquo; for his &#8216;leadership and management&rsquo; skills.</p>
<p>But anyone who saw his performance on Channel 4 News the day after Henry Webster was attacked might beg to differ.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think there is always a danger where there is a mixture of races and peoples which reflect the community we live in that any tension that might exist, any little scuffle or fight, can be twisted to be much more of a major thing than it really is,&rsquo; he told the cameras.</p>
<p>No, this is not a misquotation. He really did use the words &#8216;little scuffle&rsquo; to describe the attack in which Henry Webster was left brain damaged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the immediate aftermath, neither the &#8216;outstanding&rsquo; Mr Colledge nor any of his colleagues visited the Webster family or even sent a get well card. Mr Colledge later told a governors&rsquo; inquiry that gestures such as sending cards or flowers &#8216;were not in his nature&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Parents and former staff say that multiculturalism at Ridgeway, under his leadership, meant pupils on both sides of the religious and cultural divide breathing the same air but sharing very little else.</p>
<p>Asian youngsters, we have been told, had their own officially designated meeting room which, to all intents and purposes, became the unofficial base for a 30-strong crew known as the &#8216;Asian Invasion&rsquo; and the &#8216;Broad Street Massive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Many, if not all 12, of those convicted of assaulting Henry belonged to the gang and lived mainly in the vicinity of Broad Street in Swindon. Four of them were still pupils at Ridgeway. They would often call older relatives and friends from outside school to settle disputes.</p>
<p>One such was Wasif Khan, then 18, who was the person who wielded the claw hammer. He was a &#8216;wannabe militant&rsquo;, according to the police, and carried on his mobile phone a screensaver of the collapse of the World Trade Centre. A number of accomplices used social networking sites to communicate their message.</p>
<p>One said: &#8216;Play with a gun, play with a knife, play with a Bangli [Bangladeshi] and you&rsquo;ll lose your life.&rsquo; A second posting featured a soundtrack with anti-Western lyrics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no suggestion that these poisonous views were shared by the majority of the Asian pupils at Ridgeway  &mdash;  in fact, bar the members of the gang who attacked Henry, there were generally very good relations between the Asian and white pupils.</p>
<p>Police attend the Ridgeway School after the hammer attack on Henry</p>
<p>Police attend the Ridgeway School after the hammer attack on Henry</p>
<p>Most have no interest whatsoever in violence. Equally, there are inevitably white children at the school who have been guilty of reprehensible behaviour.</p>
<p>But the disturbing, and disproportionate, influence the Broad Street Massive is said to have exercised over the life of Ridgeway School is revealed in statements summarised in court papers obtained by the Mail, from parents, pupils and former staff.</p>
<p>All are expected to give evidence for the Websters in the High Court over the next few weeks. Racial intimidation and violence, they say, was commonplace and escalated into a mass fight on the school tennis courts after Asian gang members threatened &#8216;warfare&rsquo; against white pupils.</p>
<p>Yet the school&rsquo;s extreme sensitivity on ethnic issues allegedly allowed the thuggish minority to believe they were &#8216;untouchable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>One parent, Donna Burnett, said that when her son Alistair got into a fight with a member of the &#8216;Asian Invasion&rsquo;, Alistair received a longer suspension. When she reported her fears about the Asian gang causing racial tensions to teacher Dawn Blackler, her reaction, she claimed, was abrupt to the &#8216;point of being rude&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another parent, Gail Rich, tells in the court papers how her son Taylor was assaulted by Asian gang members  &mdash;  who filmed the attack. Those responsible, she claimed, were not disciplined, which meant they continued to pick on her son.</p>
<p>Taylor, on the other hand, was disciplined for wearing an England football shirt to school  &mdash;  because it contravened the rules on uniform  &mdash;  while pupils from ethnic minorities, she says, were not punished for wearing hoodies or listening to music on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>On one occasion, one youngster turned up for class wrapped in a Pakistani flag. When the head, Mr Colledge, was questioned by the school governors about this, he said it was no different from a Welsh governor wearing a daffodil.</p>
<p>Yet another parent, Ashley Thorne, tells in the court papers how he was on his way to collect his son David and his friend Sam Barrington when he realised they had been injured.</p>
<p>Both the boys, he was told, had been set upon by older Asian pupils wearing knuckledusters in front of the school, while two teachers stood and watched.</p>
<p>Mr Thorne claims he heard Mr Matthews say he could not intervene for insurance reasons because the incident had not occurred within the school grounds.</p>
<p>According to the court papers, Charlotte Benhalilou, a pupil at Ridgeway, was also threatened outside the school by a young Asian man. &#8216;I&rsquo;m going to slash you up,&rsquo; he told her.</p>
<p>One of the mothers stepped in to help her and suggested that the police should be called. Instead, she said in the court papers, Christopher Walton, the acting head prior to Mr Colledge&rsquo;s appointment, simply told Charlotte to get on her bus without even asking her if she was OK.</p>
<p>And so it goes on; more than 50 pages of what is, on the face of it, damning evidence.</p>
<p>One parent&rsquo;s son, Charlie, who is now 18, only recently left Ridgeway.</p>
<p>His father said: &#8216;There were racial tensions, and I felt I had to go to the school and express my concerns about it and the safety of my son.</p>
<p>&#8216;I told the teachers there&rsquo;s a problem with the group of boys who called themselves the &#8220;Asian Invasion&#8221; and they&rsquo;re picking on people like Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was so concerned with the way the school was handling the situation that I was prepared to take him out of school.</p>
<p>&#8216;The teachers more or less tried to dismiss me. Mr Walton made me feel as if I was wasting his time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some teachers, though, shared his concerns. One of them was Rachel Barker, who also gave evidence earlier this week.</p>
<p>Ms Barker, a trainee teacher at the school for three months in 2005, said that when she first heard a pupil had been attacked in Swindon she &#8216;knew instinctively&rsquo; that it had to be at Ridgeway. &#8216;</p>
<p>I think staff found it relatively easy to cope with the unruly white pupils, but the Asian pupils were in a league of their own. I think one of the reasons there were such problems with discipline was because the school did not promote a positive culture of cohesion and integration.</p>
<p>&#8216;I felt the school was letting down its pupils; all that was needed was some education for the pupils in terms of respect and good discipline. The Asian pupils at the school were allowed to think of themselves as superior. This was partly the fault of the school because the Asian pupils would never be disciplined or, if they were, they would receive a lesser punishment than the white pupils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, it cannot be stressed too strongly that the majority of Asian pupils at Ridgeway are entirely guiltless in this affair, and should not be tarnished by the thuggery of a minority.</p>
<p>But Ms Barker said that even during her short period at the school she could feel the tensions increasing between white and Asian children, and that the school allowed male Asians to separate themselves from the mainstream.</p>
<p>&#8216;In my opinion, the school did not deal with the problem effectively because they were fearful of being accused of racism,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;After the riot [when a mass fight broke out on the tennis courts], I remember the reluctance of the school to contact the police, and their insistence on playing down what was obviously a racial incident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the nearfatal attack on Henry Webster on January 11, 2007, was not racially motivated in the eyes of either the school or the police.</p>
<p>It was triggered by a confrontation in a corridor with a 14-year-old Asian boy, which led to a challenge to a &#8216;one- on- one&rsquo; fight on the school tennis courts after classes had ended.</p>
<p>When Henry  &mdash;  who had no record of disciplinary problems  &mdash;  arrived, he was ambushed by three car loads of mostly older teenagers who had been mobilised by 59 mobile phone calls in the space of an hour.</p>
<p>Callers passed on the message that one of the &#8216;gora&rsquo; [whites] wanted a fight. The 14-year- old who had tangled with Henry earlier in the day then pointed him out.</p>
<p>In a video interview filmed six days after the attack, Henry said: &#8216;I heard screams, then I was punched in the back of the head. I was curled up on the floor, but they repeatedly kept hitting me. Then I felt the hammer hit the back of my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just to repeat  &mdash;  the scene of the attack was not outside a bar on a Saturday night, nor a sink estate, but by the school tennis courts.</p>
<p>Henry has now moved to another school, where he has fallen a year behind and is struggling to catch up. He and his younger brother Joseph, 14, live with their mother Elizabeth Walker, 46, who runs a nanny recruiting business, and stepfather Roger Durnford, 44, boss of a building company.</p>
<p>Ridgeway School disputes the allegations against it, and says blaming it for an attack outside school hours is &#8216;unprecedented and far-fetched&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After all, it would no doubt argue, a recent Ofsted report concluded: &#8216;Students feel safe in school and they show respect and consideration for each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sadly, Henry Webster and his family would beg to differ.</p>

		<p>The very same thing occurs here.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the Jena Atrocity the same thing?  Blacks jumping on an unaware white kid, attempting to kill him while he was unconscious&hellip;..and would have if a teacher hadn&rsquo;t arrived on the scene?</p>
<p>The perps in that criminal attack were rewarded with tens of thousands of dollars and applauded throughout the black community, and the media all the while going right along with the lie that the attack was not an attack at all, but a response to racism.  </p>
<p>George Orwell you were indeed a seer.  Too bad the white fools in the media are too dimwitted to really understand what occurs in the real world is not the fantasy they have been duped into stupidly believing.</p>
<p>The entire West has evolved into a scenario wherein leftist propaganda controls almost all thought.  They have created a world that doesn&rsquo;t reflect the real world as it actually is. </p>
<p>Thousands of years of bloody fighting, turmoil and chaos have taught the white race nothing.  A large number of them still insist on following false tenants that are not only destructive to the areas in which they live, but, this time, threaten their very existence as a people.</p>
<p>The only thing that might save a good portion of them is if they suffer an economic&hellip;..or manmade or natural&hellip;.. disaster of epic proportions and pull back into the confines of all white territories, with a super capacity to defend themselves.</p>

		<p>This is entirely typical of schools were there is a sizeable portion of Asian students. At my school, where Whites were a minority, I was threatened with a knife several times, and once with rape (I&rsquo;m male) by groups of Asian boys. Whites and blacks never stood up for each other like the Asians, for fear of being called racist, and living with this in an 80% Asian area. There were two (half) Asian teachers who encouraged this pretty explicitly, when I reported one of them to the headteacher I was suspended for a week.</p>
<p>They are extremely violent, but small and not strong or intelligent. Whenever there was a one on one fight between a Black or a White and an Asian, the Black or White kid won everytime. Nothing ever serious happened to me, most of the victims were Black, even though there were more Whites than Blacks, and the only victims of male rape were Black. It doesn&rsquo;t just happen in schools either, a month ago a group of Bangladeshis burned to death a Black youth.</p>

		<p>They just need a little more diversity training. Then they wouldn&rsquo;t need to gang up on whites. Whites would act just the way they would want them too. And when too much stress builds up and a smaller version of one of these events takes place, the white parents would be too scared to say anything aside from, &#8216;my child is not a racist. We&rsquo;re not racists&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This is further evidence of the gutlessness of the self-appointed &#8216;educational elite&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Spinless Mr(s) Colledge lacked the backbone to cofront important issues, as he is a public-sector employee with an undersrvedly protected state pension to worry about.</p>
<p>Also, we have to remember, the &#8216;educational&rsquo; establishment or the foremost propagandists in the pretence that diverstiy (deathversity) can actually work.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m interpreting this article right, 30 out of 70 minority students at the school were members of a violent, anti-white, pro-terrorist street gang.  Assuming that most or all the gang members were males, which is a certainty, and that the female minorities didn&rsquo;t have radically different views from their male co-ethnics, I think we can say that the statement that &#8220;there&rsquo;s no suggestion that these poisonous views were shared by the majority of the Asian pupils at Ridgeway &mdash; in fact, bar the members of the gang who attacked Henry, there were generally very good relations between the Asian and white pupils&#8221; is false.  </p>

		<p>I hope the Â£1 million lawsuit succeeds, but I rather doubt that it will. Even if it does, that probably will not affect the prevailing anti-white culture at that or other schools.</p>
<p>Sending white students into such a situation is actually a form of child abuse, and the parents need to make other arrangements for the education of their children. It&rsquo;s obvious that what we in the US would call public schools are as unusable in the UK as they are in the US.</p>
<p>Wherever there is multiculturalism, decent white people should abandon the concept of a public school education as unworkable.</p>

		<p>This is the England the sellout politicians have deliberately allowed to develop, even invited with their traitorous asylum and &#8220;multicultural&#8221; immigration policies over the decades. Yet the British people are supposed to be horrified at the thought of the BNP gaining supporters because of the orchestrated lies. What other party will actually stand with spine for the British people?</p>

		<p>How many more of our people have to be attacked before we finally wake up and fight back? The image of Katie Piper and the damage done to her face is etched in my mind. It is the &#8220;go along to get along&#8221; attitude that will prove fatal to us as a race and we will have no one to blame but ourselves. </p>

		<p>Of the Asians I know they were mostly as weird as Japanese porn.  Not violent and fairly book smart.  Though unable to apply their knowledge to anything outside of writing a A+ paper.  Then again most of the Asians I know are Chinese, Thai, or Japanese.  I am sure when you get into the lower Asian countries they get less intelligent and more violent.</p>

		<p>The reason why white kids are now subjected to such attacks extends far beyond the weakness and irresponsibility of schoolteachers. An atmosphere of guilt and shame can be blamed for the brutal attack on Henry Webster. Due to the history of European colonialism and oppression of non-whites around the world, many anti-white hate merchants use that oppression in order to collectively silence us. If we ever complain about such attacks, they retort by saying &#8220;Oh, well this pales in comparison to the oppression my ancestors had to endure at the hands of whites&#8221; or &#8220;You guys possess systemic power and privilege, so our bigotry means nothing.&#8221; Due to this whole idea of systematic inequality, all whites are now guilty regardless of personal attitudes or behavior. The article by Dr. Frank Ellis regarding the Marxist origins of multiculturalism and political correctness is very illuminating. In today&rsquo;s climate, we are the kulaks and non-whites are the workers. I say it&rsquo;s about time we Kulaks started taking back our nations.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much I believe  the different standards used  in disciplining the non white students to a lesser degree than the white students for exactly the same kinds of offenses is due to fear of reprisal ftom the non white students.  Many readaing my post right now might remember very recently there was some controversy regarding the Tuscon Arizona unified School District and it&rsquo;s attempt  or success, I&rsquo;m not sure at this point since I have not followed up on the matter recently, to quite literally create policies by which different disciplinary standards are used for non white and white students.  These different disciplinary standards are a manifestation of the same mentality that people who support affirmative action policies have.  It is affirmative disciplinary action you could call it.  Expect to see more of it in the future.</p>

Concernicus, I hope you understand that the &#8220;Asians&#8221; referred to in Britain are from the Indian sub-continent, in this case almost all Pakistani Moslems. </p>

		<p>Times are changing! Times have always changing, but with increased immigration, it&rsquo;s like the world we thought we lived in already belongs to the past.</p>
<p>I mean that immigrants from Third World countries are bringing to our western democracies, a new level of violence in our societies. Something our kids are not necessarily prepared to cope with.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, in the Canada of the 1980&rsquo;s, if another boy in school, was giving me a hard time, it has happenned that I&rsquo;d challenge them to a one on one, clean, fair, fistfight. The matter would be solved that way&hellip; We never hurt each other really badly, to say the truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying fistfighting is the best way to deal with interpersonnal conflict; we sure need to develop better social skills than throwing punches&hellip;</p>
<p>But at least, when I was a kid, it wasn&rsquo;t like you were putting your life in danger if you issued or accepted such a challenge: where I lived, there weren&rsquo;t that many immigrants for the Third World. And those who did go to the same scholl I did, tended to be well behaved.</p>
<p>I understand that nowadays, for a whole bunch of reasons, kids from foreign countries often become gang members; and since they hang out in packs, and carry weapons or tools that may be used as weapons, if you challenge one of them to a fight, you are literaly risking your life!</p>
<p>So I say the times are changing. And time is not on our side!</p>

		<p>Once again an article contains the &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist&#8221; disclaimers.A kid was maimed for life and STILL these have to be added. Are these considerations ever taken when the races are reversed?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no suggestion that these poisonous views were shared by the majority of the Asian pupils at Ridgeway &mdash; in fact, bar the members of the gang who attacked Henry, there were generally very good relations between the Asian and white pupils.</p>
<p>Most have no interest whatsoever in violence. Equally, there are inevitably white children at the school who have been guilty of reprehensible behaviour.</p>
<p>Again, it cannot be stressed too strongly that the majority of Asian pupils at Ridgeway are entirely guiltless in this affair, and should not be tarnished by the thuggery of a minority.</p>

<p>Which is why we need to abandon the meaningless PCspeak term &#8220;Asian&#8221; in favor of the previous, racially-descriptive word &#8220;Oriental.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221; is a geographical descriptor, not a racial one.  People of many different races live in the huge land mass of Asia.  Pakistanis and Japanese have absolutely nothing in common, racially.<br>

		<p>The unwillingness to confront non-whites on their racism and bad behavior has been a staple in Western white societies for over 30 years now.  It&rsquo;s already destroyed much of our educational system and social fabric.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it destroys whites altogether, because that is flat out the goal of many blacks and muslims. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no different here, except the issue is black students. Teachers are afraid to discipline  these full-grown 18 year old blacks in their classrooms, where if there&rsquo;s as few as two or three black males (that few is very rare), they&rsquo;ll beat the living gee-whiz out of the teacher.</p>

		<p>Just one more reason, of many, as to why any thinking parent should refuse to enroll their children in public school. The entire environment in most public schools is anti-white and anti-Western Civilization. This malignant bias is pervasive throughout the public systems, including in text books. It is imperative that all parents of white children find a good private school, or home school your children. If white children are placed in public school today, not only are they likely to be victims of violence but they will also be taught to hate everything about their ethnicity and culture. A culture and a people that hates itself will not survive for very long. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Wasif Khan, then 18, who was the person who wielded the claw hammer. He was a &lsquo;wannabe militant&rsquo;, according to the police, and carried on his mobile phone a screensaver of the collapse of the World Trade Centre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One said: &lsquo;Play with a gun, play with a knife, play with a Bangli [Bangladeshi] and you&rsquo;ll lose your life.&rsquo; A second posting featured a soundtrack with anti-Western lyrics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khan is just a savage. And an adult attacking with lethal force and intent to kill [carrying the claw hammer is surely a sign of using lethal force] a minor too. 30 students, so called, intimidate the remaining 1700 and the teachers. It is not so much PC that inhibits the actions of the teachers and &#8220;headmaster&#8221;, but just plain ordinary fear of having a claw hammer embedded in their head. Probably by Khan.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t disagree with you more.</p>
<p>As Whites are becoming a minority in their own country, and as they are marginalized, targeted and attacked by NAMs, they will increasingly need to use force to protect themselves and their loved ones against NAM violence and mayhem.  </p>
<p>If the economy collapses, deadly force won&rsquo;t be a choice.</p>
<p>The NAMs we deal with here in California do not understand anything about &#8216;interpersonal conflict&rsquo; or &#8216;social skills.&rsquo;   That is failed, lefty clap-trap used to get Whites to disarm themselves, not fight back and give in to non-Whites, many of whom would not hesitate to kill us.  </p>
<p>We are told  &#8216;Violence Doesn&rsquo;t Solve Anything&rsquo;  or &#8216;You Need to Sit Down and Talk through Your Differences&rsquo; by those who pontificate to us that guns cause crime  &mdash;  while barricading themselves in gated enclaves that boast &#8216;armed response.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The msm refuse to report NAM-on-White crimes or crime rates and we are emphatically told (whenever Whites are victims) &#8216;Race had Absolutely Nothing to Do With It!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wrong, Wrong, Wrong.</p>
<p>NAMs, with a lower threshold for violence than Whites, neither respect nor understand touchy-feely, feminized, non-violent gobble-de-gook, but they do understand a good, strong show of force which will make them think twice before victimizing us.  </p>
<p>This is why Whites need to teach their children self-defense, perhaps martial-arts, to protect themselves at school and later how to safely handle guns  &mdash;  and to use these things with deadly force and extreme prejudice if necessary, as extreme prejudice and violence is used against us.</p>
<p>Would that more Whites would fight back, and fight back hard, maybe NAMs would think twice about attacking us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Due to the history of European colonialism and oppression of non-whites around the world, many anti-white hate merchants use that oppression in order to collectively silence us.&#8221;</p>
<p>If confronted with this, Whites should simply reply that ALL races and countries down through history engaged in very unjust and brutal behavior (ie. conquered others, raped, pillaged, stole, fought wars, enslaved etc.)and Non-Whites were every bit as bad as Whites. However, it has nothing to do with people today. Nice try.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;You guys possess systemic power and privilege, so our bigotry means nothing.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, Whites need to say nonsense and let them know that non-Whites are favored (ie.affirmative action,government aid for college or opening a business, government/state jobs, the massive amount of aid Whites spend on social welfare for non-Whites etc.) They can also be reminded that  in any non-White country, the people who make up that country hold the power ie. Mexicans hold the power in Mexico etc..</p>

<p>That about describes it. Whites are now like colonists, again, being a slim minority among the savage indigenous types. The only problem is that a large portion of Whites can&rsquo;t help but breed with the indigenous peoples, and the other fraction of whites think that the indigenous have a culture that trumps ours, and by trumps, I mean physically assaults. </p>
<p>Sometimes I really do think all the good whites in the world died out by 1945. It&rsquo;s as if the nuke that went off in Japan caused a post-apocalyptic nightmare in the world where nothing is right. Like living in hell or a jungle, with a tenuous shroud of &#8220;civilization&#8221; guiding us. </p>
<p>Alex Kurtagic&rsquo;s book &#8220;Mister&#8221; takes place in the future, but it pretty much applies right now. Living in NYC, for example, a city run by a black beaurocracy, is an example of how nothing works, violence is rampant, promiscuity, miscegenation and degeneracy are the norm, and normal pure-white types are just being taken along for the ride. Heck, sometimes I&rsquo;m just glad to see Orientals get on the train since they&rsquo;re more reliable and trustworthy than the degenerate whites here, and would probably look out for me in the event of an incident. <br>

KC</p>
<p>Not precisely.   Non-whites were <i><b>much worse. </b></i> <br>
Bad as we might have been, we never equaled Aztecs, Africans, or Orientals for cruelty or fiendish tortures.  Nor for rapacity or mercilessness to the vanquished.  In that regard, we have to concede the prize to them.  It&rsquo;s all theirs.  We were bad, even very bad, but not <i> that </i> bad.  </p>
<p>And do let us note (and never fail to remind them) that all notions of democracy, racial or sexual equality, human rights, compassion for animals, empathy for others, generosity to the poor, magnanimity to defeated enemies,  emerge from  Western culture. Nowhere else.  Such notions are utterly alien to those cultures mentioned above.   We forgive our former enemies, give them aid, and help them to rebuild their countries, making them better off than before.  An utterly novel concept in the world!  We don&rsquo;t disposses them, torture them,  enslave them,  or eat them.</p>

<p>Dear Bon,</p>
<p> When I wrote about developping other social skills than punching other people, I was not referring to the kind of situation that prevails in places where non-White street gangs attack White people. I was writing about my own experience back when I was in school, in an almost exclusively White town. I was referring to the kinds of interactions, we honest and decent people should normally have, among ourselves (White or non-White)&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry if wehat I wrote was ambiguous (English is not my native tongue).</p>
<p>Now, if you are forced to deal with people like Khan and his friends, I of course understand, that&rsquo;s a whole different thing!</p>
<p>The best thing that could happen to Khan, I think, would be to get a taste of his own medicine. Or get his neck broken in a one on one fight against someone who knows how to look out for themselves.</p>
<p>Now, believe me when I say I am all in favor of teaching our kids how to defend themselves, Bon. I myself have studied Kung Fu and I have different weapons of my own, at home. But at 12 against one (like in this case), unless you&rsquo;re Superman, how can anybody in such a situation win? </p>
<p>Getting into fights with violent immigrants, to defend ourseleves on the streets, is one thing, but over the long run, I think what we really have to do is to DEPORT all violent non-whites back to their places of origin! I know that sounds like an ambitious project, on a grand scale. But I believe it could be done.</p>

<p>Being cautious around strange blacks, for example, is no different than being cautious around poisonous snakes.

<p>I am a racist. Not by nature, but because non-Whites and their whole anti-White propaganda have made me into one. </p>
<p>But youy know, I wonder what being a racist really means, sometimes; if I have a different towards people like Blacks and Latinos, not because I have always hated them, but because knowing what they are capable of, I simply want to be able to look after myself and my kin&hellip; does that actually make me a racist?</p>
<p>Perhaps the term should be clearly redefined, instead of allowing liberals and Hollywood impose on us their own conception of what racism is!</p>
