			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randy James, Time, October 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Traveling some 27,000 miles, African-American journalist Rich Benjamin roamed the U.S. from 2007 to 2009 exploring a major demographic shift that is attracting remarkably little attention  &mdash;  the flight of white residents from cities and integrated suburbs into cloistered, racially homogeneous enclaves. Tidy communities such as St. George, Utah, and Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho  &mdash;  places Benjamin calls Whitopias  &mdash;  have grown at triple the rate of America&rsquo;s cities in recent years, raising troubling questions about the country&rsquo;s multiracial cohesion. The Stanford literature Ph.D. chronicled his adventure in a new book, <cite>Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America,</cite.>
<p><b>Let&rsquo;s start with the title of your book  &mdash;  what is a Whitopia, exactly? It seems to be more than just a place where a lot of white people live.</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. A Whitopia has three things. First, it has posted more than 6% population growth since 2000. The second thing is that the majority of that growth  &mdash;  upwards of 90%  &mdash;  comes from white migrants. The third thing a Whitopia has is an ineffable social charm  &mdash;  a pleasant look and feel.</p>
<p><b>You say that many Whitopias offer a high quality of life and tend to perform well on those &#8220;Best Places to Live&#8221; lists that run in magazines. Do you think people are also drawn to these places specifically for their whiteness?</b></p>
<p>The major draw to Whitopia is that they&rsquo;re safe communities with good public schools and beautiful natural resources. Those qualities are subconsciously inseparable from race in many Americans&rsquo; minds. For some people, race is a major role, and they said so to my face, but most of the Whitopians I encountered aren&rsquo;t intentionally practicing racial discrimination or self-segregation.</p>
<p><b>You say Whitopias can form even in the middle of diverse cities. How is that possible?</b></p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t realize that diversity isn&rsquo;t the same as integration. Blacks and whites in New York, where I live, are as segregated today as in 1910 [based on a sociologists&rsquo; segregation index that measures how much contact people of differing races have with one another.]</p>
<p><b>What is the danger Whitopias pose to America as a whole?</b></p>
<p>You can call me old-fashioned, but I&rsquo;m an integrationist. A democracy can&rsquo;t function at its optimum unless all members are integrated as full members.</p>
<p>A community full of like-minded people tends to enforce their own view of the world and close off opposing viewpoints. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Are there any places that are getting it right now? That serve as a model for what you&rsquo;d like to see?</b></p>
<p>There are communities around the country that get it right. Maplewood, N.J., has all the attributes of a Whitopia  &mdash;  high property values, great public schools, neighborliness  &mdash;  and yet it&rsquo;s also integrated and very diverse.</p>
<p><b>What surprised you about the communities you spent time in?</b></p>
<p>I was caught off-guard by the level of hostility to immigration reform in many of these communities and by how concerned many are by taxes  &mdash;  they believe taxes are too high. But I was also caught off-guard by how pleasant an experience it turned out to be, the personable warmth that greeted me in many cases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Two things I always notice whenever this subject is discussed by an admitted &#8220;integrationist&#8221; (like Benjamin). They always espouse their non-proven notion that such segregation is necessarily &#8220;bad&#8221; in any meaningful way.  Second, though they don&rsquo;t come out and admit this in the open, their plans to &#8220;correct&#8221; this cannot be implemented in any other way except by FORCE.</p>

		<p>I tend to be the new kind of racist, and an uber-evil racist at that (whites for the most part are innocent and yet have grievances against non-whites) but even being the new kind of racist, I have to admit, you can be in most kinds of neighborhoods in the US, just traveling by, and if you find out it&rsquo;s a black neighborhood, your opinion of it changes. That&rsquo;s some kind of prejudice. One you don&rsquo;t really have control over. </p>

		<p>Well, how does one answer the obvious? People, when not coerced, will associate with their own.  The disingenuous journalist- author deplores racial segregation in New York City,the bastion of diversity, yet considers white enclaves to be a negation of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and eventually a danger to the cohesiveness and survival of the Republic!!  He seems not to get the message that, when offered the choice, both black and white families will flee crime, foreign customs, poor schooling, and retreat into a comfort zone that poses no threat to any political entity.  They pay taxes, raise their children to be good citizens, and lead exemplary lives&hellip;. This is bad??</p>

<p>This makes black people jealous, since they could never produce the same, left to their own devices.  They can destroy a pleasant look and feel, but not create it.</p>
<p>So what are white people supposed to do if they like &#8220;pleasant&#8221;?<br>

		<p> Rich Benjamin is a good example of the incredible arrogance and presumption shared by both black and White liberals. What makes him think someone appointed him to &#8220;un-segregate&#8221; America? And how does he define that so-called &#8220;integration&#8221;? Probably as a situation in which the black males have easy sexual access to the White females.</p>
<p> Like the small Midwestern town where I live   &mdash;   a place one would except to find very &#8220;White,&#8221; although definitely not one of his so-called Whitopias. It&rsquo;s rare in this town nowadays to see a black man with a black woman   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re always accompanying some sleazy-looking White girls, with two or three mulatto kids in tow.</p>
<p> Benjamin can think it&rsquo;s not human nature to separate into racial and ethnic groups if he wants to. But he&rsquo;s wrong. A meal where everything is slightly separated on your plate is just as much a meal as a pot of stew where everything&rsquo;s been stirred together. The only major country I can think of where such &#8220;mixing&#8221; has actually occurred on a large scale is Brazil. Is that what we want America to become? I don&rsquo;t.</p>

Mr. Benjamin apparently has done a great service to America by exposing this trend of hate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny but when non-whites seek their own and ask to preserve their &#8216;historically non-white enclaves&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s seen as an act of pride. When whites seek their own, it needs to be exposed and stopped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure local, state, and federal agencies are indebted to Mr. Benjamin for his research. I have no doubt they&rsquo;ll do what they can to curtail this trend. We can&rsquo;t have clustered concentrations of whites. That might lead to safe, stable, and thriving communities.</p>

		<p>He gives himself away with this line (see original article):</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the tea-bagger movement, where people are concerned their taxes are going to be wasted on minorities and illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least Time didn&rsquo;t dare use the term themselves, and instead wrote:  &#8220;See pictures of the tea-party protests.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Bejamin against the idea of our taxes going to illegal immigrants, by the way?<br>

		<p>The more we tolerate &#8220;diversity&#8221;, the more we tolerate &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, the more we tolerate a literal invasion from Mexico and Central America, the more difficult it&rsquo;s going to be to escape and have any &#8220;Whitopias&#8221;.  When that point is reached, and it will be reached sooner than we think, it&rsquo;s going to be impossible to escape any way we try other than with a violent revolution.  The way Whites cowtow to multiculturalism and diversity now, are they going to be in the mood to fight then?  Once hate crime laws are passed how are we going to fight?  Once the government eliminates our right to bear arms how are we going to fight at all?</p>
<p>Just keep watching your ballgames and your American Idol, and Queen Oprah, you out-of-touch-with reality White folks.  </p>

		<p>It sounds like Mr. Benjamin is projecting his own Stanford PhD level of intelligence &amp; law-abidingness onto the majority of blacks: that is why he doesn&rsquo;t see why most people, even blacks, associate black neighborhoods with crime &amp; poverty.</p>
<p>He should turn his efforts to the other &#8216;flights&rsquo;, Asian, black, hispanic, etc.  It&rsquo;s just easier to live where a majority of people share your culture.</p>

		<p>So the moral of the story is this - white people like to live among other white people, even if they profess(or pretend)to be unconcerned about race, specifically. Even the latter intuitively know that an all-white enclave will necessarily be safer, healthier, possessed of a better standard of living, better jobs, etc., etc. Sounds like paradise to me!!  </p>

Hence the point of forming Whitopias.  At the point in history, insulation is the last refuge from inculcation.</p>

<p>And since it&rsquo;s impossible to integrate blacks completely with any other race, any society that has blacks cannot function at its optimum.</p>
<p>In fact, multiracialism involving ANY of the earth&rsquo;s racial groups fails every time it is tried.  It is at odds with human nature and instinct.  And, anybody who thinks he can alter human nature/instinct in more than a small segment of a population, via brainwashing and propaganda to suit his ideology, is a fool, and there should be a Pulitzer Prize for that.  That way the Obamanation would have two Pulitzers instead of just one.</p>

		<p>       If everyone was treated equally, that would be unfair to minorities.<br>
 <br>
       White males are held to a higher standard than their counterparts; in the USA whites are forced to achieve at much higher levels to obtain similar results&hellip; if whites fail to achieve, society imposes punishments: this is called affirmative action; in which preferential treatment will be giving peoples of other persuasions, this a lesson that whites males must learn. Blacks and Latinos take priority.<br>
  <br>
	Black pressure groups have not limited their attention to so-called affirmative action. They have brought about busing and forced integration of schools and neighborhoods, a program that is heightening racial tensions and drastically harming educational quality. Whites in many cities have had to remove their children from the public schools and then pay for private education so their children could be safe and well educated. <br>
	<br>
         Government has forced higher taxes on productive Americans in order to finance exorbitant and wasteful welfare programs. They have practically handcuffed police and the courts, preventing them from dealing firmly with violent criminals (most of whom are Black). They have opened the floodgates of unrestricted Third World immigration, which increases unemployment and adds to already high cost of welfare and crime. All these policies go directly against the interests of America&rsquo;s European America population.<br>

<p>&#8220;Immigration reform&#8221; is just a nice name for amnesty. We don&rsquo;t need any reform/amnesty. We need are laws enforced. Also, we don&rsquo;t &#8220;believe&#8221; taxes are too high, they ARE too high. Notice these people like the author of &#8220;Whitetopia&#8221; never admit there is a big problem, they just say people &#8220;feel&#8221; there is a problem.</p>

<p>Riiight. The reason most Whites prefer to live with other Whites is simple. The want nonexistent crime, damage to public spaces low, and taxes at reasonable levels.</p>
<p>Consider this book a shot across the bow of what is left of White America. Blacks want to see all Whitopias block busted through Section 8 housing. Whites are the primary source of what Black politicians call &#8220;Revinoo.&#8221; i.e. money that can be appropriated by black voters from white homeowners. It happens all the time in my diverse community. I&rsquo;d like to leave, if only I could, but I&rsquo;m stuck for the moment. By the way, ya gotta see my tax bill. It has about 15 items, all due to special taxes and bond measures, for some of the most frivolous stuff you can imagine, most of them passed in the last decade mainly because of one black politician on the school board.</p>
<p>Diversity sucks if you&rsquo;re white and have a bank account.</p>

		<p>That TIME would interview this vacuous fool shows how empty TIME has become. As the previous news media article on him revealed, he has nothing to say that isn&rsquo;t some form of white bashing, whether subtle or overt. Even the invented term &#8220;whitopia&#8221; is a put down, implying that whites are chasing some mythical chimera. However, the fact that the concept of a whitopia has to be shot down shows it has at least some basis in reality. After all, no one ever talks about a &#8220;blacktopia,&#8221; as such a concept would be as inconruous as a space colony on Pluto. No all black community ever bears the slightest resemblance to a desirable place to live,  and so there is no need to point out its weaknesses.</p>

<p>Noooooo. If you&rsquo;re an integrationist, you are NOT old-fashioned.  The idea that all races should live with eachother has been around since the 60s and was not what this country was founded upon.</p>
<p><b>A community full of like-minded people tends to enforce their own view of the world and close off opposing viewpoints. </b></p>
<p>Really?  Wow!  I suppose by that logic that black Harlem is telling, say, Korea what they should do.  A community of &#8220;like-minded&#8221; people means they stick to themselves, thus, aren&rsquo;t imposing their views on others.  They have heard opposing viewpoints, been around opposing lifestyles, and have come to the conclusion that they prefer their own.</p>
<p>Can liberals and non-whites please stop forcing themselves upon us?  We, middle class, conservative &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites are sick and tired of it.  Leave&hellip;.us&hellip;.the&hellip;.hell&hellip;alone!</p>

I don&rsquo;t know about the US but here in Canada very few people know about the organization or that a modern white movement is happening at all. I&rsquo;ve introduced at least one hundred whites to AmRen and I&rsquo;m pleased with my effort. </p>

		<p>I did some some research on Maplewood, NJ and found it to have an almost identical population to the suburb in which I live SW of Chicago.  Thus, I can make some solid comparisons:</p>
<p>1) Crime Rate: my town is 100 per 100,000 and Maplewood is 340.<br>
2) School assessment: my town&rsquo;s is 5 (of 5 possible stars) and Maplewood&rsquo;s is only 3.<br>
3) Property taxes in my town are but one half of those in Maplewood.<br>
4) Dmeographics: my town is 99% White whereas Maplewood is 59% White and 32% African.</p>
<p>Finally, a topic sentence appeared but 12 days ago in a Maplewood news source that has NEVER been in our local newspaper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven adults and two juveniles were arrested following a melee in Maplewood on Oct. 1, during which a 17-year-old male was stabbed in the back, police said.&#8221;  One can guess the &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; persuasions of the nine perps.</p>
<p>Maplewood is bordered by Newark, East Orange and Plainfield.  Draw your conclusions.</p>

A non-White majority town full of unlicensed taco stands, crime and thuggish police, poor social services, overcrowded and underperforming schools&hellip;not pleasant generally.  The good neighborhoods (there are a few) are majority White of course.<br>
Many neighborhoods that were once pleasant and peaceful, full of productive and kind citizens are now black or brown ghettos. <br>

		<p>As #4-nt wrote, blacks living en masse and left to their own devices (and governance) will produce a Third World disaster zone every time. </p>
<p>I remember once as a rookie patrolman, newly assigned to the ghetto, a tremendous thunderstorm swept through one summer evening. </p>
<p>When the rain stopped, the farthest downhill portion of every street had become a shin-deep garbage pile of styrofoam food containers, liquor bottles, used condoms, dirty needles, empty cigarette packs, chicken bones, lotto tickets, household trash, etc.</p>
<p>The event rendered me utterly speechless - I simply could not comprehend how human beings in the United States would live that way. </p>
<p>The images of that evening, along with those of the countless murders, shootings, and brutal beatings I&rsquo;ve responded to, are forever burned into my memory. </p>

		<p>To Paul Jones: Yes Maplewood is all that he said, but it is funny that he doesn&rsquo;t talk specifically about the town high school, Columbia High. It is a disaster, I graduated from Columbia but would never send my kids there. Talk about racial friction; there are hallways in Columbia (East Wing) that white kids do not walk through for fear of being assaulted by &#8220;children of the rainbow&#8221;. Columbia went from one of the premier high schools in NJ to just another Newark satellite, gangs and all. Very sad. The only thing that keeps Maplewood alive is it&rsquo;s close proximity to NYC and it&rsquo;s easy accessibility to the Erie Lakawana railroad that takes the yuppies there. I would not invest in Maplewood real-estate&hellip; </p>

<p><i>Can anyone here verify this statement as truth or fiction?? I&rsquo;d appreciate it.</i><p>It&rsquo;s &#8220;diverse&#8221; the way an &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; integrationist like Benjamin likes it: according to the Wiki article on Maplewood NJ under &#8220;Demographics,&#8221; Maplewood is (as of the 2000 census) 58.78% white and 32.63% black, with negligible percentages of &#8220;others.&#8221;  The median income, according to a 2007 estimate, is rather high: for a household in the township it was $94,253, and the median income for a family was $111,725.  The per capita income for the township was $36,794. Only 4.4% of the population and 3.4% of families were below the poverty line.  Property values are comparatively high: Estimated median house/condo value in 2005: $399,700 - no public/&#8221;affordable&#8221; housing projects there that I can tell.  The median age at 38 years is also comparatively higher than the typical integrated/&#8221;changing&#8221; community.<p>To sum up, the blacks that live there in Maplewood appear to be higher income - higher than the median household income in New Jersey and much higher income than the median black household in the US.  The condominium of these comfortable blacks with upscale whites over Maplewood makes for little genuine &#8220;diversity,&#8221; either racially or economically.<p>I cannot vouch for Benjamin&rsquo;s claims of &#8220;neighborliness,&#8221; but I have seen web references to Maplewood as firmly Democratic and &#8220;super-progressive.&#8221; Thus I have no problem imagining that the whites that live there are enclosed in an amiable aura of perpetual self-congratulation over their dappled neighborhoods, or that the blacks there find such white folks more tolerable than other &#8220;crackers.&#8221;

From what I can find on Google, Maplewood, New Jersey seems to be one of those small, very wealthy liberal enclaves (population 23,375). Median household income is around $94,796 and the median house value is $489,452 (the average house price is $506,503). It has a surprising high percentage of blacks: 32.6%. I suppose we can safely assume that these are &#8220;the creme of the crop&#8221;. It&rsquo;s hardly one of those cheap, rural small towns that would draw migrants.

		<p>Wherever there is white flight, there are the blacks in hot pursuit.  Notice that Rich Benjamin had to scour all over the country to search out and identify Whitopias so they can be targeted bythe government for the destruction that comes with black diversity.  This guy cannot take a hint (that whites move clear across to BFE to get away from black people) and will not accept the outright truth (we don&rsquo;t want to be around you).  This guy cannot understand the right to freely associate or NOT with whomever you please.  </p>
<p>For all the screeching about white racism, you think that blacks and other minorities would want to stay far, far away and live their own lives without white interference.  They foam at the mouth in their churches, preaching Kill whitey, but they refuse to live without them near by.  </p>
<p>One would think this guy would stop trying to spoil Whitopias and actually use what he discovered to create some Blactopias.  Instead he has to get his shorts in a twist that Whitopias exist at all.  I guess it drives this &#8220;old-fashioned integrationist&#8221; just crazy that somewhere out there, whites exist who are happy and secure, because they are free from people like him.</p>

Being a &#8220;conservative&#8221; means always playing defense, always having to say &#8220;no I&rsquo;m not&#8221; instead of being free to say what we are for.

		<p>Maplewood NJ is an affluent suburb of NYC where blacks with above average incomes live.  Many of the blacks, maybe a majority, are of Caribbean origin.  The schools have lower test scores and there is more crime compared to towns with similar property values due to all the blacks, but its not a hell hole.  Places like this mean nothing because the vast majority of blacks can&rsquo;t afford to live in places like that.  It&rsquo;s the same situation where rich liberals and &#8220;color blind&#8221; conservatives assume that all minorities are like the few token ones they meet at their job or in college and can&rsquo;t understand why the working class white people don&rsquo;t want blacks in their neighborhood because there is a black lawyer who works for their company and he is very intelligent and nice etc. etc. etc.  </p>

<p>   I have a hunch that this is an upper income limousine liberal suburb of New York City. It is probably totally untypical in that it lacks a good mix of incomes, classes and educational levels. In another words, it can&rsquo;t be duplicated in the rest of the country.  I also wonder just what is the racial breakdown?

From Wikipedia:<br>
As of the census[4] of 2000, there were 23,868 people, 8,452 households, and 6,381 families residing in the township. The population density was 6,207.1 people per square mile (2,393.6/km2). There were 8,615 housing units at an average density of 2,240.4/sq mi (864.0/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 58.78% Caucasian, 32.63% African American, 0.13% Native American, 2.86% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.56% from other races, and 4.01% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.23% of the population.<br>
Estimated median house/condo value in 2005: $399,700 (it was $222,700 in 2000).[citation needed]<br>
There were 8,452 households out of which 40.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.2% were married couples living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.5% were non-families. 20.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.27.</p>

Columbia High School is an extremely diverse school ethnically, with just over half the students being of African-American heritage and just under half being Caucasian. There has been much discussion regarding the Racial Academic Achievement Gap in the school district. During the 2004-2005 school year, the student run Martin Luther King Association organization demanded more access to higher level academics for minorities in the district. Most recently, on March 29, 2006 there was a student walk-out and protest regarding issues such as the outsourcing of security positions, a proposed schedule change, and alleged racial remarks made by the principal. The protest was considered a success. The superintendent announced his resignation the next day. The protest is also believed to have heavily influenced the Board of Education election a few weeks later. Two incumbent members were voted out, including the chairman, in a landslide election.<br>

		<p>The situation here in the South is pretty stable. My home town is at least 55% black, but my prosperous bedroom neighborhood is more like Whitopia. Yes, closer towards midtown the scene changes to one of unkempt houses, much higher noise levels, people slowly waddling across the streets holding up traffic, and coarse behavior in stores and public areas. I must point out however, that there is indeed a Blacktopia on the other side of town. Their houses are very nice and their yards well kept. It&rsquo;s amazing how uniformly appealing the place is. Apparently income trumps race, but these two &#8216;Topias are mostly segregated. One sees the same in churches here. I can tell you that although the preaching style is different in Black churches, they harp on morality and personal responsibility even more than they do in my White church. I notice that racial hostility in this town is higher than in a similar nearby town with a smaller population. Size matters too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; you arrogant low-life, allow me to explain this to you in terms you may understand. Whites, or pure Whites of wholly European heritage, make up a strikingly small fraction of the world. </p>
<p>Those with the most White blood will necessarily engender the most pleasant living conditions; those with the purest White blood will necessarily lead to the advancement of society to its highest possible point, technology notwithstanding, as seen in the Renaissance, Europe, or even New York City in the 30s.</p>
<p>This idiot cannot seem to understand that. The browning of a society affects everybody except the brown people, because they are incapable of suffering from or even realizing the change.</p>
<p>If the arrogant, self-righteous author is browsing this website, which I don&rsquo;t doubt he is since he seems pretty interested in White Nationalism, I ask him to really think about that before he publishes another book pushing for genocide.</p>

<p>Native born White Americans do not need your permission to exist. In fact, WE don&rsquo;t not care what you think. WE will do what WE think is best for our racial interests. Things like deporting twenty million mostly hispanic illegal aliens,shutting LEGAL IMMIGRATION down to 0 and deporting the asian fifth column.</p>
<p>So Benjamin can you think of any reasons why NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS should tolerate their race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,muslims,asians and africans such as  the anti-white Kenyan bigot and foreigner in the White House(if he looks foreign and has a foreign name&hellip;well by golly, he&rsquo;s a foreigner).</p>

		<p>I wonder what Rich Benjamin encountered when he ventured into  &#8220;white america&#8221;.  Was his care stolen?  Was he beaten and robbed?  He obviously wasn&rsquo;t murdered by some roving gang of thugs over 10 or 20 dollars.  Did he see industrious activity amongst the populace?  Was in influenced by any of this.  Probably not.  White people live among other white people not so much because the &#8220;like&#8221; them, but because they can deal with problems in a rational, reasonable way, and the majority (not all) will be somewhat responsible people not blaming everybody else for their problems.  Your white neighbor can accuse you of a lot of things, but he can&rsquo;t accuse you of racism.  He can&rsquo;t blame you for his failures because you&rsquo;re white and he&rsquo;s not.  This is why I choose to live in a predominantly white area.  It cuts down on many ( but not all) problems.  And of course our biggest problems come looking for us as dark skinned crime gangs constantly comb the city for potential victims.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;What is the danger Whitopias pose to America as a whole?&rdquo;  &mdash;  post #42.</p>
<p>Indeed, one wonders why Benjamin is so stunned by White enclaves that he would spend years seeking them out and writing a book on the subject, as if to expose them. Perhaps he is one of those paranoid blacks that&rsquo;s convinced that wherever Whites congregate we are busy plotting nefarious acts against minorities.  He needn&rsquo;t worry.  Or maybe he&rsquo;s just flattering himself. But anyhow I have lived in White enclaves most of my life and can testify for sure that Whites in such areas do not focus any negative energy on non-Whites.  In fact, minorities rarely if ever even come up in conversation.  Whites here are too busy engaging in normal White activities  &mdash;  gardening, husbandry, art, building, White church life, parents&rsquo; activities at our White schools, hunting, reading and writing classic books, theater, swimming, chess, White sports like canoeing, cycling etc and designing, creating, inventing  &mdash;  to be obsessed with non-Whites.  The truth beknownst non-Whites are totally safe from the Whites of Whitopia.  We are so absorbed by our own interesting White culture you almost no longer exist, Benjamin.  Be relieved, not concerned. </p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever there is white flight, there are the blacks in hot pursuit. Notice that Rich Benjamin had to scour all over the country to search out and identify Whitopias so they can be targeted by the government for the destruction that comes with black diversity.&#8221;  &mdash;  post #37</p>
<p>This occurred to me also.  He may have been bankrolled for just this purpose. The American blacks are just the tip of the iceberg though. After all, the government has to know where to deposit the next hoarde of Hmong, Somali or Bhutan refugees. Those thousands of Bhutans arriving in NY, hmmmm, maybe the government will re-settle them in parts west.  Thanks Benjamin.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t resist this one from #25&hellip;.&#8221;We can coexist with Asians&hellip;&#8221;.  Uhh, speak for yourself, bud.  If we wanted to be with Asians we would just move to Chinatown or Hongcouver instead of seeking out Whitopias.  Whites can&rsquo;t co-exist with Asians  &mdash;  right now our instinct for racial survival is at an all-time low. We have been too brainwashed to believe that the cache in proving you&rsquo;re not racist is much more important than continuing your genetic line.  Add Asians to this unhealthy mindset and soon we would be miscegenated out of existence.  Asian women prefer White men, and White men and women have been taught to hate their Whiteness.  You can see what this leads to. In terms of threatening the survival of the White race Asians in our midst are as toxic as any other race.</p>

There&rsquo;s is no way you can now legally get away from them .They are in almost all of the neighborhoods, no matter how exclusive . More and more, it is now the whites who seem to be falling through the cracks .You can&rsquo;t compete against affirmitive action living in a region that is 65% minority . Even into the eighties we were largely, completely in charge . Not so now . Enclaves are forming, by counties . And the NAACP is gnashing it&rsquo;s teeth over it . The future promises to be if nothing else, very interesting . Will there be more government troops to enforce more integration or should I say amalgamation ? Will the south simply lie down and submit as they have in the past ? Will I have to take my family and run for the nearest enclave in the middle of the night when law and order finally breaks down permanently ?

		<p>These &#8220;whitopians&#8221; being written about in this Time magazine article are living among their own kind of people.  They have chosen to do so.  This is the sort of environment that they choose to love in and that makes them happiest.  This guy writing the article wants to go in and change their way of life and their environment.  It&rsquo;s high time people stood by any means necessary to any sort of attempts by anyone or anything to force a particular way of life on them against their wishes.  There is nothing right about it.  To take peoples freedom to live around other people of ones choosing away is fundamentally wrong in every way, there is no justifying it with some sort of ridiculous statement like &#8220;You can call me old-fashioned, but I&rsquo;m an integrationist. A democracy can&rsquo;t function at its optimum unless all members are integrated as full members&#8221;.  Well if the author likes this idea so much he should move to or stay in New York or New Jersey.  As far as this example of a nice neighborhood in New Jersey that has all the charm of whitopia but is very diverse.  Well as a general and overwhelming rule the more &#8220;diverse&#8221;  a neighborhood is the less of those &#8220;whitopia&#8221;  qualities it possesses like safety and cleanliness. The author doesnt really care about those things as much as he does advocating the forcing of &#8220;diversity&#8221;  down white Americas throat and the progressive march towards a socialist order in America.   </p>
<p>You know it really isn&rsquo;t any ones or anythings business to work towards destroying any sort of enclaves such as Whitopia.  There is something very wrong when the government or anyone else steps in and forces change.  There is something very fundamentally wrong with it.  It really isn&rsquo;t any of their or anyone else&rsquo;s business but they have been making it so.</p>

		<p>For the person who commented on Brazil: &#8220;The only major country I can think of where such &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; has actually occurred on a large scale is Brazil. Is that what we want America to become? I don&rsquo;t.&#8221; I have been to South America. From my experience, Brazil is very segregated. The whites and lighter skin mestizos have most of the money and success. Often they do not like blacks or people with darker skin. For such a diverse country, most of its celebrities models are white, even blond. Blacks, even rather nice blacks, are treated like field workers and servants. </p>

<p>I second you on that.  It&rsquo;s a few years time now since I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil, but unless things have changed drastically, that is absolute true.  There&rsquo;s an awful lot of misinformation out there from starry-eyed people who&rsquo;ve never been to Brazil,  but who for some reason  picture it in their minds as some sort of integrated racial utopia.  I don&rsquo;t know why this is.  It&rsquo;s all in their imagination    &mdash;   wishful thinking from people who&rsquo;ve never been there. </p>
<p>In the better restaurants, hotels, department stores, you saw hardly a black face anywhere. Not even clerks.  Nor in the better neighborhoods or the fashionable streets (except as nannys, servants or delivery people).  In fact,  I noticed that you can see more black faces here on Fifth Avenue than you would see on any fashionable avenue in Rio.  And that goes for all the rest of Latin America too.   At the Rio yacht club there were NO blacks, browns or light tans either   &mdash;   all white.  You might think you were in Europe   &mdash;   except that Europe nowadays is getting much browner and more integrated than Brazil is, strange to say.  </p>
<p>Whites in Brazil (and Latin America) have not been incucated with racial guilt and make no apologies for their success and prominence.  And blacks in Brazil are NOT challenging, aggressive, sarcastic  and confrontational    &mdash;  -  as they so often are here.  It simply would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I flew to Brazil (a long while ago),  It was on a Brazilian airliner.  I looked around and realized that EVERYONE on this Brazilian plane was white, including  all the crew.  No mulattoes either!   Upon landing in Rio,  I saw nothing but white faces inside the terminal.  Everybody was white. You wouldn&rsquo;t see this scene at any big air terminal in  the USA.   It was only when I got outside that I finally saw some blacks who were taxi drivers and police. I remember it vividly.  Granted, this first experience there was quite some  time ago.  It&rsquo;s probably changed somewhat by now, but I don&rsquo;t think that much.  I don&rsquo;t recall noticing any differences the last time I was there, just a few years ago. </p>
<p>I am sure, though, that they are under pressure from the forces of liberalism in North America and Europe, so some concessions will have been made.  Indeed, all Latin Americans are increasingly coming under such pressure.  It is being coordinated and it is no accident.  Flying to Bogota last spring, I found myself seated next to a garrulous gent who  was employed by the UN in Geneva and by some gigantic American philanthropic foundation  (maybe Ford).  He&rsquo;s a tri-racial Colombian who lives in Geneva and New York.  He is multi-racial and multi-lingual   &mdash;    the very dream of &#8220;diversity&#8221; come true.   This AA  PhD was being sent down there, to his parents&rsquo; country,  to teach Human Rights  to the &#8220;Afro-Indigenous population&#8221;.  I recall that he was enormously enthusiastic about the election of Obama, whom he compared (racially) to himself.  He virtually worshipped the new messiah, and  felt this marked the beginning of a new era in Latin America.  Perhaps it does. </p>

<p>You are right about post #25. He probably has an asian girlfriend or wife. Race-replacement by post-1965 asians, street by street,town by town,city by city and state by state, is completely unacceptable to White Nationalists-and apparently to a lot of Native Born White Americans who are not open White Nationalist. It is also unacceptable to race-replace Native Born White Americans in the labor market with post-1965 asians and their &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline. My late father, a United States Air force veteran, mechanical engineer and Irish Catholic father of a large family was raced-replaced in the labor market It was both economic and racial violence inflicted on my family by the treason lobby(Republican party and Democratic party). He was etremely bitter about this two months before he passed away.</p>
<p>The asian-philes here really disgust me. How did Native Born White Americans ever manage when the asian &#8220;American&#8221; population was much much smaller? Very well thank you. The asians in OUR AMERICA-take that Richard Benjamin-are demanding that Native Born White Americans 1)accept massive lies about themselves and 2)and lay down like a doormat as the asians come in and walk over Native Born White Americans. I will not consent to 1) and 2). </p>

		<p>I think a lot of good White people would save a lot of time if they instead of trying to reason with the unreasonable and debate with those who have chosen to be inimical, rather simply identified people as pro &amp; principalled, neutral shameless wanton and unprincipalled, and envious, and refused to enter into any debate or justification with the envious or the unprincipalled. One can only reason with another who is reasonable, and while communicating with those who are undecided may be beneficial to both involved, on the other hand attempting to justify,debate, argue whether constructively or critically,  and reason with anyone who is decidedly an unprincipalled Liberal or an outright envious scorpion (barbarian looking for whatever you got in the form of a handout while posing as a peace loving benign human leech),  is not only engaging in futile illogic, afronting themselves by the mere presence of an envious person, but also giving the wrong impression that we might feel the need to justify or explain anything, which in a small form is equivalent to an admission of guilt. Far better to make no apologies and refuse to engage or speak with those who are envious and inimical at all.</p>
<p>Suppose all Whites in America marched over to the gates of China and demanded a free hand out, do you think the Chinese would try to reason, debate, justify, apologize, etc. with us? And what do you suppose they would do if, God forbid we accused of them of the most evil ad hominem accusation in existence by calling them &#8220;racist&#8221;? I can tell you with certainty, they&rsquo;d laugh in our faces, and call the military to force us to be on our way, imprison us if necessary, or shoot us out right. </p>
<p>Attempting to reason with someone who is envious and unreasonable, is not merely a waste of time but an insult to oneself.<br>
Anyone who is envious of you, has already chosen willfully of auto-pilot-subconsciously to be your enemy whether actively or passively, and let us all remember, mercy to the enemy is cruelty towards oneself. </p>
