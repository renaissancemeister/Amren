<h1><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091028134637.htm">Bad Driving May Have Genetic Basis, Study Finds</a></h1>
 

<p>ScienceDaily, October 28, 2009</p>

<p>Bad drivers may in part have their genes to blame, suggests a new study by UC Irvine neuroscientists.</p>
<p>People with a particular gene variant performed more than 20 percent worse on a driving test than people without it-and a follow-up test a few days later yielded similar results. About 30 percent of Americans have the variant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people make more errors from the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Cramer, neurology associate professor and senior author of the study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex.</p>
<p>This gene variant limits the availability of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor during activity. BDNF keeps memory strong by supporting communication among brain cells and keeping them functioning optimally. When a person is engaged in a particular task, BDNF is secreted in the brain area connected with that activity to help the body respond.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that in people with the variant, a smaller portion of the brain is stimulated when doing a task than in those with a normal BDNF gene. People with the variant also don&rsquo;t recover as well after a stroke. Given these differences, the UCI scientists wondered: Could the variant affect an activity such as driving?</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to study motor behavior, something more complex than finger-tapping,&#8221; said Stephanie McHughen, graduate student and lead author of the study. &#8220;Driving seemed like a good choice because it has a learning curve and it&rsquo;s something most people know how to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The driving test was taken by 29 people-22 without the gene variant and seven with it. They were asked to drive 15 laps on a simulator that required them to learn the nuances of a track programmed to have difficult curves and turns. Researchers recorded how well they stayed on the course over time. Four days later, the test was repeated.</p>
<p>Results showed that people with the variant did worse on both tests than the other participants, and they remembered less the second time. &#8220;Behavior derives from dozens and dozens of neurophysiologic events, so it&rsquo;s somewhat surprising this exercise bore fruit,&#8221; Cramer said.</p>
<p>The gene variant isn&rsquo;t always bad, though. Studies have found that people with it maintain their usual mental sharpness longer than those without it when neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&rsquo;s, Huntington&rsquo;s and multiple sclerosis are present.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s as if nature is trying to determine the best approach,&#8221; Cramer said. &#8220;If you want to learn a new skill or have had a stroke and need to regenerate brain cells, there&rsquo;s evidence that having the variant is not good. But if you&rsquo;ve got a disease that affects cognitive function, there&rsquo;s evidence it can act in your favor. The variant brings a different balance between flexibility and stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>A test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes,&#8221; Cramer said. &#8220;I wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Cramer and McHughen, Paul Rodriguez, Laura Marchal-Crespo and Vincent Procaccio of UCI worked on the study, along with researchers from the University of Florida. The National Institutes of Health funded the study.</p>
