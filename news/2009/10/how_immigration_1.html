<h1><a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Wooldridge/frosty506.htm">How Immigration and Multiculturalism Destroyed Detroit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frosty Wooldridge, News with Views, October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For 15 years, from the mid 1970s to 1990, I worked in Detroit, Michigan. I watched it descend into the abyss of crime, debauchery, gun play, drugs, school truancy, car-jacking, gangs and human depravity. I watched entire city blocks burned out. I watched graffiti explode on buildings, cars, trucks, buses and school yards. Trash everywhere! Detroiters walked through it, tossed more into it and ignored it.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands and then, hundreds of thousands today exist on federal welfare, free housing and food stamps! {snip} I saw Lyndon Baines Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221; flourish in Detroit. If you give money for doing nothing, you will get more hands out taking money for doing nothing.</p>
<p>Mayor Coleman Young, perhaps the most corrupt mayor in America, outside of Richard Daley in Chicago, rode Detroit down to its knees. {snip}</p>
<p>As a United Van Lines truck driver for my summer job from teaching math and science, I loaded hundreds of American families into my van for a new life in another city or state. Detroit plummeted from 1.8 million citizens to 912,000 today. At the same time, legal and illegal immigrants converged on the city, so much so, that Muslims number over 300,000. Mexicans number 400,000 throughout Michigan, but most work in Detroit.</p>
<p>As the Muslims moved in, the whites moved out. As the crimes became more violent, the whites fled. Finally, unlawful Mexicans moved in at a torrid pace. You could cut the racial tension in the air with a knife! Detroit may be one our best examples of multiculturalism: pure dislike and total separation from America.</p>
<p>Today, you hear Muslim calls to worship over the city like a new American Baghdad with hundreds of Islamic mosques in Michigan, paid for by Saudi Arabia oil money. High school flunk out rates reached 76 percent last June according to NBC&rsquo;s Brian Williams. Classrooms resemble more foreign countries than America. English? Few speak it! The city features a 50 percent illiteracy rate and growing. Unemployment hit 28.9 percent in 2009 as the auto industry vacated the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;By any quantifiable standard, the city is on life support. Detroit&rsquo;s treasury is $300 million short of the funds needed to provide the barest municipal services,&#8221; Okrent said [Daniel Okrent, &#8220;The Tragedy of Detroit: How a great city fell and how it can rise again,&#8221; Time Magazine October 4, 2009]. &#8220;The school system, which six years ago was compelled by the teachers&rsquo; union to reject a philanthropist&rsquo;s offer of $200 million to build 15 small, independent charter high schools, is in receivership. The murder rate is soaring, and 7 out of 10 remain unsolved. Three years after Katrina devastated New Orleans, unemployment in that city hit a peak of 11%. In Detroit, the unemployment rate is 28.9%. That&rsquo;s worth spelling out: twenty-eight point nine percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As you read in my book review of Chris Steiner&rsquo;s book, <cite>$20 Per Gallon,</cite> the auto industry won&rsquo;t come back. Immigration will keep pouring more and more uneducated third world immigrants from the Middle East into Detroit  &mdash;  thus creating a beachhead for Islamic hegemony in America. If 50 percent illiteracy continues, we will see more homegrown terrorists spawned out of the Muslim ghettos of Detroit. Illiteracy plus Islam equals walking human bombs. You have already seen it in the Madrid, Spain, London, England and Paris, France with train bombings, subway bombings and riots. As their numbers grow, so will their power to enact their barbaric Sharia Law that negates republican forms of government, first amendment rights and subjugates women to the lowest rungs on the human ladder. We will see more honor killings by upset husbands, fathers and brothers that demand subjugation by their daughters, sisters and wives. Muslims prefer beheadings of women to scare the hell out of any other members of their sect from straying.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism: what a perfect method to kill our language, culture, country and way of life.<br/>

		<p>Yet, I don&rsquo;t read &#8220;black&#8221; anywhere in this article, at least in the parts published here.  It&rsquo;s somehow the fault of guns (rhetorical question:  What is it about cities that make guns behave so badly?), social welfare programs (hint:  European social welfare programs, much more expansive and pervasive than here, didn&rsquo;t cause crime and graffiti), and Muslims (though they&rsquo;re a problem unto themselves, Detroit was going way downhill and quickly before mass immigration of Muslims.  What could it possibly be?)</p>
<p>This is surprising for an Elizabeth Wright publication.</p>
<p>As an aside, if there is any one human being that can be blamed for Detroit being a heavily black and Arab city, it&rsquo;s Henry Ford.  He and his people went to the Deep South and the Middle East recruiting blacks and Muslims to move to Detroit to be cheap union-busting labor, to bust the mainly white union movement.  This is why I don&rsquo;t revere Henry Ford for his few statements against a certain &#8220;ethnicity,&#8221; nor do I subscribe to the ideology that likes to rant about said &#8220;ethnicity.&#8221;  Because it would warp my mind and make me think crazy things that I should revere a man that almost singlehandedly turn Detroit into a black/Arab dump even though I got into the right-wing to begin with because of our racial dispossession.</p>

		<p>Right on! The problem with those on the Left with this issue is that they simply fail to see reality. They live in a dream world where they cling to their naive beliefs that &#8220;diversity is our strength.&#8221; The truth is diversity is a deadly weakness. When you take people of different races, religions, beliefs and throw them all together, you have huge tensions and balkenization and destruction of the original host culture. Any idiot can see that except those on the Left of this as they are, I&rsquo;m afraid idiots.</p>

<p>I cannot agree 100% with this article, but it does touch on some interesting points.</p>
<p>These are, with some qualifications:</p>
<p>1.) The spread of the abjectly alien Islamic Arab population is horrifying, but they mostly are concentrated in the Dearborn area of Michigan, with significant and growing concentrations in the other Detroit suburbs;</p>
<p>2.) The Hispanic malignancy is less pronounced, but it too is less Detroit centered and more suburban in nature;</p>
<p>3.) Asians, particularly such as Indians and Hmong, are an ever expanding degeneracy to the suburbs;</p>
<p>4.) And blacks remain mostly in the city limits, but, they and their social pathologies also move to the suburbs at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The blacks are the most significant problem in the area, simply because they have the gleeful &ldquo;glory&rdquo; in realizing that they have exploited whitey&rsquo;s weaknesses unsurpassed for 42 years and managed to destroy an entire city in the process. They are probably the most arrogantly ignorant subculture of blacks to be found on this earth, even surpassing the ANC or ZANU PF cliques in South Africa and Zimbabwe. They don&rsquo;t simply wallow in their destructive and egotistical cretinism, they revel in it as being the alpha and omega of human progress. In all honesty, unless you have lived in the Detroit Metro area for a year or more, you cannot fully grasp just how bizarre the black spectacle and absurdity really is.   </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting because conservative immigrant Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza once claimed  minorities aspire to grab hold of the lowest rung of the ladder. Each portraying themselves as the greatest victim. They&rsquo;ve refashioned all of America in this way. Being a loser or degenerate now entitles one a higher position of moral authority. Outside of a few on AmRen the whole world seems to have adopted this code. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s really taken seriously, I don&rsquo;t think. Or at least they want it both ways. For all their rhetoric about white males or racism or the West, these are the same ones who turn down a white man in the real world when they can tell he just doesn&rsquo;t earn the kind of income they&rsquo;d like, and they don&rsquo;t need &#8216;beheadings&rsquo; to enforce that moral code. </p>

<p>I think Chicago&rsquo;s blacks can give Detroit&rsquo;s and Zimbabwe&rsquo;s blacks a run for their money when it comes to stupid arrogance and rudeness.  I don&rsquo;t know what it was about 1920s Chicago that attracted blacks out of the Mississippi Delta like a magnet, but it did.  Freed from any pretense of discipline, and pandered to and groveled to for decades, Chicago&rsquo;s blacks are generally so rude and arrogant that you can&rsquo;t even look them in the eye.  And Chicago being in Illinois, the &#8220;Land of Lenin,&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t help much either.  When your state&rsquo;s license plates have a visage that means much the same thing to me (now an IL resident) that a visage of Hitler would mean to a Jewish motorist means that your state isn&rsquo;t about to solve the problem anytime soon/ever.</p>
<p>And as you might say, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Detroit is the harbinger of the fate that will befall many other cities in the United States and Canada due to multiculturalism, third world immigration, and the relentless advancement of African blacks to northern locales and municipalities (Alaska, Northwest Territories, etc.).</p>
<p>And would whites want to move to London, England these days? Or the outskirts of Paris? Or Rotterdam in the Netherlands? Sydney, Australia, is no longer the idyllic southern city it once used to be. Even Winnipeg, Manitoba (i.e., Winterpeg, Manisnowba) is being besieged, as well as rural areas of America where you never dreamed you&rsquo;d see chadors and burkas. Whites can no longer afford the option of flight - it&rsquo;s about time we started to fight!</p>

		<p>The real cause of Detroit&rsquo;s descent into third world hellhole status was the arrival of blacks. The Muslims and Mexicans are just the icing on the cake. The person most immediately responsible was Henry Ford. He wanted a pool of cheap labour and used blacks as scab labour to bust unionization attempts. After Ford, FDR bears a great deal of responsibility. His administration&rsquo;s &#8220;fair&#8221; hiring pcatices during the war attracted blacks to Detroits&rsquo; war manufacturung plants.</p>
<p>Somebody asked about Chicago? Blacks migrated there from the Missisippi delta following the great flood of 1927.</p>

		<p>Being from another Midwestern rust belt, now blighted, city similar and close proximity to Detroit, I can see a resemblance of Cleveland and Detroit. Cleveland, at one time, had 1.1 million residents when the mills were pumping out alot of work. Now, it&rsquo;s under 500,000 and dying a slow painful death. We have a terrible corrupt county government (all my AmReners can google it Cuyahoga County). With dropout rates at 50% and climbing, jobless at over 10% now in Ohio, and blacks outnumbering whites in city jobs and on the council. No wonder Cleveland, and to a smaller extent Cincinnati are two of the top 5 poorest cities in the country! 2 Ohio cities. Michigan has two as well. Chicag and Gary Indiana are in their as well, if you look at the top 20. New Orleans is again gaining population, but careful what you wish for&hellip; Mostly Mexicans who &#8220;helped rebuild&#8221; after the major storms and hurricanes. If you look at metro areas throughout the country who hold alot of power in politics among blacks, you will see some struggling economies, because businesses DO NOT want to open in ghettos! That, my friends, is common sense. But I read a post not long ago that was right on the $$. We gotta take a stand sooner or later. We can&rsquo;t hide from the undesirables, the white ones and the other ones. That&rsquo;s been going on for too long.</p>

		<p>I imagine that the steel mills of Northwest Indiana, and the railroads and slaughterhouses of Chicago itself are what southern blacks were recruited for. </p>
<p>As for Detroit, it has been a basket-case for years. It has been subsisting on state and Federal money. The only supplement to our tax dollars has been the illegal economy of drugs, sex and guns. The comparisons with Joburg are pretty obvious but generally overlooked, given the lessons to be derived from same.</p>

		<p>In recent years, I have visited Michigan and Detroit on several occasions, usually to attend sporting events. The stadium district is the only portion of Detroit that resembles a habitable urban area. </p>
<p>It was shocking to watch the local television news: violence and murder fueled by drugs are so commonplace that the news anchors simply reading the reports as if it a matter of routine and as if it is happening a million miles away. The drug addled witnesses are sometimes happy to appear on television.</p>

		<p>This article is absolutely absurd.  It wasn&rsquo;t Muslims or Mexicans who ruined Detroit.  Black ruined Detroit back in the 1960&rsquo;s when they were the only real minority group in the area.  Again, it&rsquo;s not Muslims that are contributing to the 50% illiteracy rate in Detroit, it&rsquo;s blacks.  Many of the Arabs in Detroit are not even Muslim anyway.  </p>
<p>What is going on with articles like this?  Is this some kind of new PC pseudo-racialism where Muslims are the preferred targets and blacks cannot be directly criticized?  </p>
<p>As for what attracted blacks to Detroit and Chicago, it was a concerted effort by capitalists to recruit Southern blacks for cheap industrial labor.  </p>

		<p>  I had heard from others about how bad Detroit had gotten. I had to see for myself. I drove up from southwestern Ohio to see what all the chatter was about. My God, what a mess. There is no saving Detroit with any amount of money. Detroit is destroyed. There was parts of it completely abandoned, there were parts that are no-go zones for whites, and there are parts that are total danger zones for any and everybody, period. Detroit is not on life suport for any viable reason, it is DEAD.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ohio&rsquo; is one of many places Detroit is alive and well, at least in spirit. During the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s whenever there was trouble in any town in Ohio public sentiment always blamed it on &#8216;youths from Detroit&rsquo;. Not the home grown precious vital darlings. Oh no. That was the playbook nearly a thousand miles in every direction. Or should I see we were played? <br/>

<p>Two really quick points.</p>
<p>1.) There is one rather nasty truth about the blacks of Chicago, that even the ones in Detroit (for all their crazed hooting and chirping to the contrary) cannot ever match. This is fact that black Chicago was the Marxist spawning ground of the undiluted local Marxist horror show, that has become our national and &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; Comrade BO General Secretariat. In that respect, I yield a point to you QD!</p>
<p>2.) As for &ldquo;honest&rdquo; Abe, I could not agree with you more!</p>
<p>That statue of our &ldquo;American&rdquo; Stalin, should be removed from its place in the monument and hallowed out and converted into a public toilet. The monument should have Jefferson Davis&rsquo; statue placed there instead, since he did far more as the President of the CSA to honor the US Constitution&rsquo;s true spirit and intent, than did that &ldquo;savior&rdquo; of the union ever did!</p>
<p>All the best to you QD,</p>

		<p>Blacks killed Detroit after the 1967 riots.  Whites fled by the thousands.  Now, middle class blacks flee.  Detroit, Saginaw, MI and Flint are all being killed by the blacks.  Their gangs just killed a 9 month old baby, and recently a 14 month old baby.  They have the &#8220;no snitch code&#8221; in their war zone.  They are barbarians and as a volunteer at the animal shelter, (full of pit bulls) these thugs are evil and they are starting to flood into my nice neighborhood.  There are two nations of Blacks in America.</p>
<p>Has anyone seen &#8220;Who Won The War?&#8221;  maybe You Tube?  It shows Japan as a beautiful modern city of lights, civilized and rebuilt after the War.  Another slide shows Detroit, burned out after the riots 40 years ago  &mdash;  still burned out.</p>

		<p>I agree that the writer places too much blame on Detroit&rsquo;s destruction on Mid East Muslims and Mexicans, while mentioning Bantus only in passing. That&rsquo;s false, since he then goes on to say that Coleman Young brought Detroit to its knees.</p>
<p>I note he says he is a schoolteacher - no doubt, he must have thought he was &#8220;Conrack&#8221;, the white Bwana teaching the disadvantaged Bantu children, I trust he had his eyes opened on that score, in a hurry.</p>
<p>Bantus from down South did come to Detroit and Chicago, as cheap labor for the union-busting factory owners, but this began before the 1920&rsquo;s. In his book, &#8220;The Jungle&#8221; (written in 1906), Upton Sinclair wrote how Bantus were imported from Dixie to scab for the meatpacking workers who struck the stockyards (around 1905, I believe). Also, World War I created labor shortages in the big cities, which were partially filled by Bantus.</p>
<p>The writer is sounding a false alarm, thinking we&rsquo;re going to be overwhelmed by Islamic sharia law - no chance. We have the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, sometime next year (June 2010, according to projections), SCOTUS will be poised to strike down Chicago&rsquo;s ban on handguns. That means the playing field will be leveled. We will be able to own handguns to defend ourselves. All the while, Daley, Bobby Rush, Obama and Oprah Winfrey will be chimping out.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.  </p>

		<p>Detroit could be revitalized alot easier than some other cities.  It&rsquo;s status as a black majority city is fragile.  Simply buy up all that real estate I see advertised at fire sale prices and move people in there to build homes or restore the current properties.  These properties are going for as little as 500 dollars!  Move enough people in there within a year and take over the city council and mayoral offices.  Relocate the section 8 housing to a centralized location of the city.  The city could slowly but surely be brought back to life within a decade. </p>

Blacks killed Detroit after the 1967 riots. Whites fled by the thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boy is that true.  Even though I&rsquo;m a Tennessean, I have tons of connections with Detroit.  Both sides of my mother&rsquo;s family went there &amp; tried their luck in the 50&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>My uncle was once head of the Detroit fireman&rsquo;s fund.  He was severely injured in that &#8220;african-american&#8221; riot, while attempting to put out a fire set by the blacks in their own &#8220;hood&#8221;.  Pelted with bricks.  Forthwith he moved his family back to Tennessee, bought some land, and lives there still.</p>
<p>I remember a pleasant family vacation to Detroit including a trip to Tiger Stadium for a game vs. the Red Sox, previous to the riots.  Seemed like such a great place.</p>
