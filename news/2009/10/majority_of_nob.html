			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Breitbart, October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three of the five members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee had objections to the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to US President Barack Obama, the Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) reported Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;VG has spoken to a number of sources who confirmed the impression that a majority of the Nobel committee, at first, had not decided to give the peace prize to Barack Obama,&#8221; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The committee, appointed by the Norwegian parliament, honoured Obama for &#8220;for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The committee was unanimous,&#8221; its influential secretary Geir Lundestad told AFP on Friday.</p>
<p>But Inger-Marie Ytterhorn, who represented the right-wing populist Progress Party on the committee, led the way in objecting to the choice of Obama because she questioned his ability to keep his promises, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It also said the representative of the Conservative Party, Kaci Kullmann Five, and Aagot Valle, the representative of the Socialist Left, had objections.</p>
<p>The choice for Obama was however strongly supported by committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland and Sissel Roenbeck, both representatives of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>The members of the committee represent their parties but do not sit in Norway&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This begs the obvious question:  What did the two in support have to promise the three in opposition to get them to change their votes?  I think it might be some sort of quid pro quo   &mdash;   perhaps some conservative will be handed a NP in the future in exchange.</p>

		<p>When Obama won the Peace Prize, I posted on Amren that this prize is a highly political one. I was not wrong in my observation. A lot of times, arm-twisting and politicking among the judges takes place, before a winner or winners are announced. Many times they are swayed by outside influences, sometimes they aren&rsquo;t. Some illustrations:</p>
<p>Emile Zola was considered for the literature prize, but was turned down because the judges thought his work was too realistic, and Alfred Nobel did not like his novels.</p>
<p>Phillipe Lenard, a Nobel laureate in physics was anti-Semitic and hated Albert Einstein. He persuaded the physics committee to bypass Einstein for his theory of relativity work (1905), claiming it was useless. The committee didn&rsquo;t give Einstein a prize until 1921, for his work in photoeletrics.</p>
<p>In 1934, the literature committee was considering two Italians, Benedetto Croce and Luigi Pirandello. Croce hated Mussolini, whom the judges did not want to offend. So they gave it to Pirandello.</p>
<p>Conservative members of the literature committee were reluctant to give the 1950 prize to Andre Gide because of his homosexuality. They were &#8220;persuaded&#8221; to go along by their peers.</p>
<p>Many posters at Amren said the Nobel judges were clueless in awarding the Peace Prize to Obama. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. Here&rsquo;s another illustration:</p>
<p>Some years ago, a newspaperman asked literature judge Sven Hedin if James Joyce had ever been considered for the Literature Prize. Hedin looked puzzled, and replied: &#8220;Joyce? Who is he?&rsquo; </p>

		<p>There we have it folks&hellip;.. the white men on the committee were the real culprits behind this poorest of judgments.  It will now be viewed forever as the igNoble Peace Prize!<br/>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure why a p.c. leftist would oppose Obama winning the Prize until I saw this article listing the people he beat out.<br/>

<p>All of them are from the Third World and every one of them is far more deserving of the award than BHO.</p>

		<p>It was a relief to hear that not all of the Norwegians on the committee are afrophiliacs, despite the very-visible reverent push in all media channels (same old tribe pulling the strings there, even in little, far-away Norway), and in the academic world (don&rsquo;t have to look too hard to find the tribe there either).  </p>
<p>Scandinavians in general are slowly beginning to wake up to the &#8220;joys&#8221; of multiculturalism in the form of Muslims in their midsts, but haven&rsquo;t yet experienced the even greater joy that a critical mass of &#8220;bruthas&#8221; and &#8220;sistahs&#8221; can bring.  Thus they are programmed for &#8220;worship and import&#8221; mode as concerns our dusky co-mammals, at least in the near term.  </p>
<p>The fact that the majority of the committee had to have their arms twisted to vote for Jesus O&rsquo;Bama (any tribal back-door influence there?&hellip; nah&hellip; not possible&hellip;) is a positive sign of some remaining active brain cells amongst the population; not enough however to carry the day (and save the nation), as is evidenced by this now completely denigrated &#8220;prize&#8221;.  Can&rsquo;t wait to see Leif Erikson decked out in ghetto garb soon&hellip; yo!    </p>

		<p>The award has become so NWO political it means nothing.</p>
<p>Our president is a pathetic excuse for a chief executive, of course our congress is lower than him.  It is no mystery why our country is a laughing stock in this world.</p>

		<p>The on-going decadence of Europe is very sad to witness.  This is the fruit of destroying the old right in WW2.  The sound of one hand clapping?  It&rsquo;s the leftist culture that has overwhelmed Europe in the wake of the second world war.</p>
