<h1>Path to Legalization Needed, GOP Candidate Whitman Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandra Dibble, Union-Tribune (San Diego), October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the San Ysidro border fence as her backdrop, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman spoke out on immigration policy issues yesterday, saying it is &#8220;simply not practical&#8221; to deport the estimated 12.5 million illegal immigrants living and working in the United States.</p>
<p>The candidate, 53, said the solution is to find a mechanism that allows them to live here legally. &#8220;Can we get a fair program where people stand at the back of the line, they pay a fine, they do some things that would ultimately allow a path to legalization?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The former chief executive of online auction company eBay made her remarks after a two-hour ride-along with two U.S. Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>Though immigration is a federal issue, the governor &#8220;has to weigh in much more heavily on getting the federal government to fulfill its responsibility of paying for border control, of helping to pay for illegal immigrants that are in our prisons,&#8221; Whitman said.</p>

		<p>The other tech exec woman the GOP in California is counting on, Carly Fiorina, was the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.  I am not sure, but I think I&rsquo;ve heard hear name mentioned in terms of using or pushing for H-1B visas so that HP can have cheap labor.</p>

<p>It should be noted that both of these women had nothing to do with starting eBay or HP; they were both managerial munchkins that happened to find their way to CEO. </p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for either one.</p>

		<p>I have heard Whitman on radio commercials here in California. She brags about here fiscal acumen and here great interest in cleaning up California&rsquo;s debt, but supports amnesty with subsequent chain migration of millions more. Yes, as Amren&rsquo;s subheading says on this article, ANOTHER REPUBLICAN IDIOT.</p>

<p>Mandate E-verify and cut off all public benefits to illegal immigrants.  Then they will self deport.</p>
<p>It is simply not practical to keep electing traitorous politicians.<br/>

		<p>     As bad as this sounds, it is even worse. What this lady seems to be saying (and I stand to be corrected) is that all the illegals wait their turn for legalization at the &#8220;end of the line&#8221;, but they do it here in this country. All the people who are waiting to enter the US legally, will indeed get a shot at citizenship. But.. they will do their waiting in their home countries. So.. those who just ignore our borders, and many of whom have not even the slightest interest in citizenship, will remain here and just benefit from the lack of enforcement of the law. The politicians like this one will just make things worse!</p>

		<p>The main problem for both women, other than the fact that CA is solidly blue and Arnie was just a fluke, but a failure, is that they will easily be portrayed as Schwarzenegger/Bush clones, with the old caveat of &#8220;insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&#8221;   Look what is happening in NJ   &mdash;   Jon Corzine was WAY down but is now in a dead heat w/Chris Christie b/c he was able to link Christie and Bush.  (Credibly so, Christie was Bush&rsquo;s U.S. Attorney for Northern New Jersey.), and then link himself with Obama, who won NJ by 16 points last year.</p>
<p>If DiFi runs for Governor, she won&rsquo;t have to do much campaigning to win.  Even if she doesn&rsquo;t, Jerry Brown has a good chance.  Even though he has already had 2 terms as Gov., 1975-1983, the 2 term limit was passed during his tenure and therefore he was grandfathered in as an exception.  If Education Sec. Jack O&rsquo;Connell (D) runs, he might be a sleeper.  His claim to fame is blaming white teachers for black and Hispanic educational failure.</p>

		<p>At first blush this woman seemed a good choice with her business background.  This seemed exactly what California needed.   But that was before we learned what her views on the illegal invasion are.   This disqualifies her completely in my view.  I&rsquo;m sure most people in California feel the same way. <br/>
California and most other states are being killed by this invasion.  We need more Joe Arpaios.    We have one idiot in the White House, we don&rsquo;t need another in Sacramento.</p>

		<p>Why is this mantra about the &#8220;impractical&#8221; nature of mass-deportation(whether 12 thousand people or 12 million) repeated again and again without question or challenge? Who says this is not practical, or indeed not do-able? I say bunk! It can be done an should, nay, must be done!! </p>
<p>Once the official orders for the forced deportation illegals came down, at least half or more of them would simply pack up and head for greener pastures anyway. Beyond that, it is hardly a secret where most of these individuals congregate. Notify the Mexican government that they need to set-up large receiving stations for their own cast-offs they&rsquo;ve burdened us with, and get the machine running post-haste. The bulk of this work could be done in a matter of months!    </p>
<p>Let us not be cowards all our days. It is time to do, for once, what is right and necessary, and not what makes the largest number of people feel good about themselves!</p>

		<p>&#8220;it is &ldquo;simply not practical&rdquo; to deport the estimated 12.5 million illegal immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes it is practical.  But first we must get our own house in order:  </p>
<p>1.  Secure our borders;  <br/>
2.  Insist on the proper interpretation of the 14th amendment to the Constitution;  <br/>
3.  Shut down all immigration into America for 10 years.</p>
<p>We can take our time deporting the illegals.  One at a time with no need to rush.  They did not illegally cross the border in one day and we do not need to legally deport them in one day.  We can deport each one in time.  We should offer them two choices to start: Leave voluntarily now, or provide voluntary labor services for minimum wage until time of deportation.</p>
<p>Amnesty is not the answer.  Labor and deportation is. </p>

		<p>I believe like alot of people, that both parties are controlled by the same people.  Only about a year left before the midterm elections and the RNC doesn&rsquo;t have an effective strategy for combatting the Democrats and throwing them out even though the conditions are ripe for such a takeover.  The Republican Party does not seem to be interested in winning elections and with only 20 percent of people identifying as Republicans, they most certainly will not.  I even heard the big king neocon Rush Limbaugh call the Republicans just as dangerous as the Democrats.  Our real rulers will continue to fund candidates whose positions run counter to White America&rsquo;s.  They will even run candidates who claim to be on our side and if elected, they will show their true colors.  Money talks.  </p>

		<p>When I first heard Meg Whitman interviewed, she sounded like a breath of fresh air&hellip;just what California needs. I&rsquo;m sorry she&rsquo;s taken the path of least resistance on the worst problem facing the state and the country. I supposed it&rsquo;s easier to just go with those who truly don&rsquo;t care what illegal immigation has done to California and the rest of the country. How can so many people be so blind? Do they think ahead at all. Just picture the streets of Juarez and get a preview of the US. Better still, look at some of the streets of Los Angles, Houston, Miami, etc. Not a pretty picture.</p>

		<p>A vote for any Republican candidate is a vote for the death of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICA. Nothing could be more obvious. Meg Whitman was raised in Cold Spring Harbor which is the home turf of the utterly corrupt and treasonous Wall Street White ruling class.</p>
<p>The White Ruling class-or as a like to call them the revolting elites(I suppose the pun is intended)-has been stealing the wealth of the Native Born White working class for nearly four decades. What goes by the name of economic growth and prosperity is nothing more than the transfer of wealth from ordinary NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to the greedy cheating revolting White super rich elites. Without the importation of post-1965 non-white scab labor, they would never have been able to pull this  off.</p>
<p>The Republican party at its core, is the evil party. According to Christopher Buckley, William F. Buckley the Republican parties chief  propagandist, would take great satisfication in urinating on drivers-mostly NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS-from an overpass, then hope back into his limo driven by his hispanic chauffer.</p>
<p>If you voted for Ronald Reagan, this is what you voted for this.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not &#8220;practical&#8221; to deport tens of millions of illegal aliens if you don&rsquo;t enforce the law to begin with.  It would be impossible to arrest all the people that cheat on their taxes if the IRS didn&rsquo;t enforce tax law on anyone to begin with.  That&rsquo;s the way law works   &mdash;   you publicly enforce it on one person, and that scares thousands into compliance.  When the Yankee government wants to enforce a law, gosh darn it, it does.  </p>

		<p>It is hard to find words to describe the enormous greed of the greedy cheating revolting white elites. Meg Whitman- a member of this loathsome cabal-doesn&rsquo;t feel she is wealthy enough with her one billion and change. It would take the avarge White American quite a few lifetimes to spend a billion dollars. Meg Whitman wants to extract what&rsquo;s left of the wealth of Native Born White Americans-effectively reducing them from wage slaves to chattel slaves who exist only to serve the greedy cheating members of the revolting White elite.</p>
<p>Meg Whitman couldn&rsquo;t possibly spend all of her billion dollars on material goods in hundreds of lifetimes. The acquisition of massive wealth is fundamentally about low lifes such as Meg Whitmann and Bill Gates having the the status of demigods on the planet Earth with life and death power over millions of ordinary NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. They are an evil force in OUR AMERICA. If you vote Republican&hellip;.this is what you have voted for&hellip;the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>Only an organic-ground-up White Nationalist political movement can prevent this from happening. Sarah Palin is on-board with race-replacement. Do not vote for her and her vice Presidential candidate-the hindu Booby Jindal.</p>

		<p>It has been practical for decades to systematically discriminate against Whites.<br/>
     It has been practical for decades to tolerate non-White criminality.<br/>
     It has been practical for decades to tax working people in order to support tens of millions of people who won&rsquo;t work.  <br/>
     It has been practical for decades to lie to the American people about nearly everything.<br/>
     But it&rsquo;s not practical to deport unwanted foreigners.<br/>
     <br/>
     World War Two wasn&rsquo;t practical either.</p>

		<p>Many of us whites are simply leaving the California Republican Party. I left two years ago, right after voting for Ron Paul. I&rsquo;m not going back. I wrote the GOP national chairman and listed all of the reasons why a lifetime member like myself (I had never voted anything but Republican for almost 30 years) was compelled to leave. I received no response.</p>
<p>The GOP is dying. A third party will have to emerge in this country. Something on the order of a BNP without the negative history would be awesome. </p>

<p>I suggest everyone call her comment line and give her a piece of your mind -(888) MEG4GOV.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought Meg - use E-Verify and deport all illegals. Send them on a military hop and bring them to their country of origin. Tag them somehow so that when they do come across again, they&rsquo;re immediately deported.</p>
<p>I wonder if the reason she wants them here is that her business somehow benefits from them.</p>

<p>One could say it&rsquo;s not practical to enforce our speeding laws with so many drivers doing it but the fact remains that nearly 41 million traffic tickets are issued each year amounting to billions in fines against the offenders.  Is it not practical or not profitable?  I have an idea.  The law allows seizures of property and assets for certain drug offenses so why not illegal entry into the country?  Seize all homes, wages, vehicles, everything but the clothes on their back.  Everything gets auctioned off and law enforcement agencies and Senators/Congressmen from that state get an automatic 1 percent of the proceeds.  I guarantee enforcement of the law will take on a new zeal and the amount of cash rolling in will make the special interest&rsquo;s payoffs look like chunk change.</p>

Don&rsquo;t they send a large portion of their earnings back home?  And, who is it that benefits from this cheap labor?  Certainly not the consumer!</p>

		<p>#10 - Both parties are controlled by the same people indeed.  Look at what is happening to all Western nations.  Coincidence?  Not one iota.  It&rsquo;s just some of their pawns aren&rsquo;t as obliging as others.  England is shot.  France isn&rsquo;t too far behind as is Germany.  And, except for Norway, Scandanavia is in a downward spiral.  Five years ago, I laughed at conspiracy theorists.  Now, I am one of them.  After all, what better cover does a conspiracy theory have than the stigma of lunacy when one believes (so, I guess I&rsquo;m a looney).  The enemy within is far more dangerous than the enemy without.  The enemy within is much harder to recognize because they generally operate covertly.  For us, they&rsquo;ve recently been more in the open but most still don&rsquo;t see it.  In all of recorded history, empires have been brought down from within.  Ours will be no different.<br/>

		<p>American tech companies are the last place we should turn to for leadership. One reason we never emerged from the depression of 2001 (now in year EIGHT) is because many of the silicon valley companies were destroyed by fakes from India. Without a boom in a core industry (technology, &hellip; uhm&hellip; war industry?) we will remain in a depression. Unemployment in the great depression was only 19% with gdp growth of 4% many of the years. We have zero growth and unemployment rate of 45 % (22% unemployment, 11% welfare, 12% disability). This is the worse our country has ever seen. Read my article http://www.vdare.com/letters/tl_102709.htm</p>

		<p>Of course the Republicans are behaving badly, however, to those of you who are critical of them I have a few questions:</p>
<p>1.  Have you ever signed up to be a delegate in your state elections?<br/>
2.  Have you campaigned for local politicians?<br/>
3.  Have you run for office?</p>
<p>Quit whining and change the party from within.  Changing the party from within works.  </p>
<p>I have campaigned in VA and have been a delegate.  </p>
<p>One of the politicians I campaigned for only won his state senate district by only 96 votes.  He is now poised to be Attorney General for VA.  His name is Ken Cuccinelli and he gets the illegal immigrant issue and called Bush out when Bush pushed for things like amnesty.</p>
<p>It can be done.  Northern VA has gone almost all Democrat (thanks to NE migration).  The tide has shifted back, however, not by whining but by hard work.</p>
<p>Get out there and do something within the party.  The GOP can be salvaged from within, but you will have to work hard to do it.  Third parties will only allow us to be divided and conquered.</p>

		<p>A practical, 6-point plan to deport 12 million illegals:</p>
<p>1.  Build a fence along the Mexican border<br/>
2.  Implement E-verify across the board<br/>
3.  Impose heavy civil and criminal penalties for knowingly hiring illegal labor.<br/>
4.  Deny every conceivable governmental benefit   &mdash;   healthcare, housing, welfare, education, social security   &mdash;   to any illegal immigrant.<br/>
5.  Deny federal funds to any state or local government that refuses to do #4.<br/>
6.  When an illegal is apprehended, confiscate all property and money in his possession because it represents the ill-gotten proceeds of his crime.  This is allowed under the constitution.  The proceeds are to help fund any increased costs from 1 through 5 above.</p>
<p>And then watch them disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s impractical to settle this continent?&#8221; No.<br/>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s impractical to build a railroad from coast to coast?&#8221; No.<br/>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s impractical to run phone wires to everybody&rsquo;s house?&#8221; No.<br/>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s impractical to put a man on the moon?&#8221; No.</p>
<p>Americans rolled up their sleeves and did all this, plus countless other things that were daunting tasks. When did we become a nation of p*****s who shrink from assuming a difficult task?</p>
<p>We can do this if we want to. I want us to. I&rsquo;ll bet you do, too. All it takes is leadership from decent white folks, of which we have little at this point.</p>

		<p>On this issue and many others, I feel a third party is the essential first step toward political sanity. Arrogant policies result from the two party system; somehow the winning of 51 plus percent results in a mandate from the people to enact all sorts of transforming legislation, or to ignore pressing issues that aren&rsquo;t popular with the elites, because the &#8220;majority&#8221; has approved inaction. A third party convention will at least result in an airing of the alientated majority&rsquo;s issues. <br/>
Furthermore, a politician winning in a three way race by a clear majority will indeed have a mandate. If that politician merely wins the election by a plurality, complexities result that will keep an office holder hesitant to enact defiant laws, to the relief of the citizenry. As it is, we don&rsquo;t have &#8221; a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,&#8221; per Churchill, but we do have a nullity wrapped in a slogan inside a backroom deal. <br/>

<p>At least she admits that there are 12.5 million illegal immigrants here. That&rsquo;s more than most political hacks would do.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The candidate, 53, said the solution is to find a mechanism that allows them to live here legally&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitman is another RINO pretending to be a true conservative. This &#8216;darned good&rsquo; Conservative (her words) told the San Francisco Chronicle in May that she is a &ldquo;huge fan&rdquo; of Van Jones and stated:  &#8221; Jones is doing &lsquo;a marvelous job… I&rsquo;m a huge fan of his. He is very bright, very articulate, very passionate. I think he is exactly right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2003-4, she supported California&rsquo;s stupid, uber-liberal senator boxer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whitman endorsed Democratic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer in 2003, records show. Whitman contributed $4,000 to Boxer in the 2004 reelection campaign   &mdash;   and endorsed Boxer as a part of Technology Leaders for Boxer, confirmed Boxer aide Rose Kapolczynski&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Both parties say whatever they think the majority of voters want to hear. They know that once they are elected, they can do whatever they want, including siding with lefties.</p>
<p>I listened to Whitman&rsquo;s interview Oct 23 on John &amp; Ken&rsquo;s radio show.  She knows John &amp; Ken hammer illegal immigration every single day so when asked about her stance on illegal immigraion she answered similarly to this (from the SF Chronicle):     </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;We have to prosecute illegal aliens and criminal illegal aliens in all of our cities, in every part of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitman was questioned&hellip;regarding sanctuary cities. She [said] &#8216;there is an ordinance on the books that protects illegal aliens and criminal illegal aliens. We have to stop that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We have to prosecute illegal aliens and criminal illegal aliens in all of our cities, in every part of California ..which is consistent with federal immigration law&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>California is broke, deeply in debt, irredeemable and ungovernable, as Schwarzenegger learned.</p>
<p>And this, from Jupiter:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to Christopher Buckley, William F. Buckley, the Republican party&rsquo;s chief propagandist, would take great satisfication in urinating on drivers-mostly NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS-from an overpass, then hop back into his limo driven by his hispanic chauffeur&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, he urinated on drivers by opening the door of his moving limo while in traffic.</p>
<p>Brimelow writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The ageing William F. Buckley, beset by bladder problems, developed the habit of opening the door of his moving limousine and urinating into passing traffic &mdash; revealed by his son, Christopher Buckley in &#8216;Losing Mum and Pup.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chis Buckley states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;If you&rsquo;re out there, the answer is, yes, you were selected from among thousands of other motorists on I-95 to be tinkled on by the Lion of the Right. You should feel honored&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, of course, WFB&rsquo;s behavior was unsanitary, disgusting, offensive and sociopathically irresponsible&hellip;&#8221; </p>

<p>BTW Jupiter, for the record, I am against ALL IMMIGRATION, legal and illegal so please don&rsquo;t accuse me supporting legal immigration.  I&rsquo;ve witnessed the devastation of legal immigration in  California.</p>

		<p>Pracitical? As a citizen, it&rsquo;s not pracitcal for me to have to keep paying for them ie.jail,food stamps,schooling,medical care etc. It&rsquo;s not practical for the American people to have to put up with the crimes they commit. Also, you don&rsquo;t have to deport them, simply have e-verify on anyone seeking jobs or welfare benefits and get rid of the anchor baby laws. When those in the country illegally can&rsquo;t make any money or get any benefits, they&rsquo;ll deport themselves.</p>

		<p>Jupiter, I am so glad you mentioned Sarah Palin as being on board with race replacement. My God, it is so easy to fool the majority of the American public, that apparently thinks Palin is just &#8220;swell&#8221;. She is a phony times ten. Her and Meg Whitman, and so many white women in politics are kindered souls. They aren&rsquo;t a bit different from the male traitors. I&rsquo;m sick of these useless(to the nations citiznery)power seeking people.</p>

		<p>How many people reading AmRen and posting on here are members of Numbersusa.com?<br/>
It is ine thing to have a position on illegal immigration and whin about it on forums, and another to do something tangible.</p>
<p>Numbersusa needs more members, they have a million but need ten million more, they were th main rweason the last amnesty failed due to their millions of faxs and phone calls, It is free to join. <br/>
People,, we all need to get off the chair and start doing stuff and not just writing posts on forums. Join Numbersusa, join Minutemen, start making youtube videos, join local groups, focus on ousting local pro immigration officials,if we can&rsquo;t get new laws passed on immigration or enforce the ones we have now in the middle of the worst job losses in decades we are doomed.</p>
<p>No more democrat or republican issues, do it for aERICA.</p>

<p>This has always existed. This was the mechanism by which my Irish forebears attained citizenship.</p>
<p>The difference is that while some people must do it legally, by the existing &#8220;mechanism that allows them to live here legally,&#8221; others simply hop a fence.</p>

		<p>Bon,</p>
<p>Whitman is NOT a RINO. She is a real Reagan Republican. She supports Wall Street crime, amnesties to destroy the lives of wage earners, and everything else dear to the hearts of the elites. She is not a conservative, call her a CINO if you will but she is every inch a Republican.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.  And more good reasons not to vote for Whitman!  As others (myself included) have written here many times, the two parties are almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>I will never support any candidate or government NEVER that thinks it&rsquo;s OK to send my children 9,000 nautical miles from our homeland to fight its dirty Third World Wars  &mdash;  and believes it is OK to send my child home in a flag-draped body bag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with the late Birdman Bryant:</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that if a politician favors war, that he should be in the first assault wave, and that if he votes for war, he should remain in the front lines until the war is over.   I believe that any adult citizen who publicly advocates war should be immediately subject to the draft, no matter what his age.&#8221;</p>
<p>George Wallace was not wrong when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the two parties!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wrote &#8216;Ron Paul&rsquo; on the California Presidential Ballot in 2008, the best of the lot, despite his wishy-washy immigration stance.</p>

		<p>E-Verify is one of the most effective, simple immigration enforcement identifiers, along with the 287 (g) police apprehension applications to deter any illegal foreign national from stealing the 15.3 million American jobs. The usual proponents are out to eliminate these powerful programs, because enforcement of immigration laws that have always been imposed  &mdash;   ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK EFFICIENTLY? HOWEVER I WILL KEEP ON REMINDING  VOTERS, TO COMMAND A  PERMANENT E-VERIFY SYSTEM FROM THEIR LAWMAKERS. The same with the simple border fence, that owing to its limited capability of stopping illegal aliens. Nobody denies that a single tier fence is not scalable, but if it had been constructed as two fences as it originally designed.  As a double lane for the fast movement of border guards, within a-no mans-land, it certainly would have certainly stopped the majority of illegal aliens caught between the two?  E-Verify on the other hand, has proved its worthiness which the treasonous lawmakers never expected to catch-on with any credibility.</p>
<p>Now they are trapped with E-Verify because the American citizenry are fully perceptive of its use. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t be on our guard, with pro-illegal immigrant legislators such as Nevada&rsquo;s Sen. Reid, California&rsquo;s Speaker Pelosi. Do not believe them when they say that they approve of E-Verify. They are lying through their teeth. Sen. Reid now must pay the &ldquo;piper&#8221; because his accreditation amongst his constituency is at an all time low? He is apt to be canned in 2010, when he comes up for a vote amongst his state voters. Not just him as many more should be booted out. Read all their immigration enforcement grading at NUMBERSUSA. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano has already shown her true colors, by informing us we need a balanced policy where ICE raids are concerned? That&rsquo;s why ICE confrontations have more or less fizzled out, contrary to what anybody says.</p>
<p>Another piece of rhetoric that White House issued a new report claiming that the Stimulus Bill earlier this year has created or saved approximately 650,000 U.S. jobs?  Yet they forgot to inform everybody that the government has imported more than a million working-age foreign nationals this year that nullified every positive impact the stimulus could have had for U.S unemployed workers.</p>
<p>WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE STOPPED. Very few politicians have tried to halt the occupancy by foreign invaders to our country? This is why the E-Verify mechanism was never mandated, owing to the fact that Americans are last to be a priority, specially the 15.3 million jobless workers. Already Hispanic Caucuses have confronted President Obama at the White House, with the chair of the House Rules Committee indicating they are giving the Caucuses what they have adamantly demanded. Rep. Louise Slaughter D-N.Y indicated that the House will have to vote on a bill that allows illegal aliens to use the new health care &#8220;exchange&#8221;. A loophole that does not require verification to keep illegal aliens out of the other parts of the proposed new federal health care system.  Please call all Democratic House Members and urge them to vote against the rule that provides a weak verification mechanism that still allows illegal aliens to purchase insurance from the health care exchange. WE MUST JAM THE SWITCHBOARDS IN WASHINGTON, PUSHING OUR OWN DEMANDS at 202-224-3121 that bars illegal aliens from the health care insurance &#8220;exchange&#8221; YOUR VOICE IS MAKING AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE TO HOW THE POLITICIANS VOTE?</p>
<p>Other pieces of information contributing to the dilemma of US legal population: Senate Census allows to Count Illegal Aliens for Congressional Districting . CBO Says New Health Care Bill Would Cover 2.5 Million More Illegal Aliens.  Reid Kills E-Verify Amendment to Unemployment extension Bill.  Pro-Enforcement Candidates win in Virginia and New Jersey.   68% of Americans Oppose Sanctuary Cities</p>
