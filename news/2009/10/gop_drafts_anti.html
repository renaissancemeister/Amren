<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27782.html">GOP Drafts Anti-Rangel Resolution</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glenn Thrush, Politico, October 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House GOP is planning a new resolution to ask Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) to step aside as Ways and Means Committee chairman  &mdash;  in the wake of revelations he underreported his assets.</p>
<p>GOP aides say they have been working on the draft for weeks  &mdash;  long before Rep. Joe Wilson bellowed &#8220;You lie!&#8221; and earned his own resolution of disapproval.</p>
<p>But part of the motivation, I&rsquo;m told, was payback at the Democratic leadership for forcing through what many Rs thought was a mean-spirited attempt to spank the South Carolina Republican, even after he personally apologized to President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Rep. John Carter (R-Texas) has announced he&rsquo;s introducing an anti-Rangel &#8220;privileged resolution&#8221;  &mdash;  one that theoretically must be voted on the floor. But the Dems, as they have done in the past, could head it off by blocking it with a procedural vote that shields members from voting about one of their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carter &#8220;says he will give Chairman Rangel until next week to voluntarily resign the chairmanship of Ways and Means, or he will introduce a privileged resolution to force his removal,&#8221; writes a spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;To allow Mr. Rangel to continue to serve as chairman is the same as allowing a confessed bank robber to serve as chairman of the Banking Committee during the trial,&#8221; Carter said.</p>

		<p>And a bank robber ISN&rsquo;T the chairman of the House Banking Committee?  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Barney Frank is the next worst thing to an out and outright bank robber; his lifetime obsession with community reinvestment acts and affirmative action mortgages shows just that.</p>

		<p>Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and the rest of the liberals say it&rsquo;s racist to criticize Obama.</p>
<p>Using their &#8220;logic&#8221; it&rsquo;s also racist to criticize Charlie Rangel, Kwame Kilpatrick, Robert Mugabe and every other black politician.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t the Republicans attack the anti-white Democrats for their anti-whiteness.  </p>
<p>So the crook didn&rsquo;t pay his taxes, the government taxes us way too much.  They should make him a hero for advocating low taxes and encourages all American to follow his lead.  </p>
<p>This practice by the Republicans of letting off the hook blacks who hate white people and want to destroy our America and then trying to kill them for tax cheating, (which I would never do or recommend) is cowardly. </p>

		<p>None of us posting here are under any misconception that a black will resign from ANYTHING! no matter the transgression no black will EVER give up the big chief position. SKIP the psychic prtedicts&hellip;&hellip;any attempt by White politicians to remove him, will end their careers.</p>
