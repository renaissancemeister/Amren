			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Rienzi, American Renaissance, December 2000</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racial egalitarianism has failed to produce the &#8220;fair and just&#8221; society promised by social engineers. At the same time, there has been a marked reawakening of racial and ethnic identity in the post-Cold War world. In response, the left has adopted a new strategy: Deny the very existence of race! This is why we so frequently hear that &#8220;race is a social construct, with no biological validity&#8221; and that &#8220;science proves we are all the same.&#8221; Ironically, it is in connection with progress in understanding the human genome  &mdash;  progress in the very field that will definitively prove the biological reality of race  &mdash;  that we most often hear that race is nothing more than &#8220;superficial&#8221; surface characteristics.</p>
<p>Against this view, there are first of all the obvious physical differences between human population groups that everyone recognizes. There is also genetic evidence that can be used independently of traditional methods to classify different human populations into racial groups that are virtually identical to those based on the allegedly &#8220;superficial&#8221; traits studied by traditional physical anthropology. As Professor Glayde Whitney has written in these pages:<blockquote>These data are therefore a virtually irrefutable demonstration of the reality of race  &mdash;  a purely statistical analysis of allele frequencies [genetic differences from one group to another] gives results that are essentially identical to the racial groupings established by traditional anthropology.<br>
</blockquote>An honest evaluation of the data confirms the reality of race. But let us look at the arguments on the other side.</p>
<p>* &#8220;We are 99.9 percent (or some other number) genetically identical; so there can be no race differences and no races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although it is true that human populations share roughly 99.9 percent of their genes, it is also true that humans share over 98 percent of their genes with chimpanzees, and a very high amount with animals like mice and dogs. Many of these genes produce basic body structures all mammals have in common; differences between organisms are caused by very small genetic differences.</p>
<p>Men and women are 99.998 percent identical but no one suggests that men and women are identical.</p>
<p>Current evidence suggests that all the sex differences between men and women are the result of just one genetic difference  &mdash;  one gene (the Testes Determining Factor) out of an estimated 50,000-100,000! This would mean men and women are 99.998 to 99.999 percent genetically identical, yet no one suggests that sex is a mere &#8220;social construct.&#8221; In like manner, the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees, which no one denies, can be described as 12 to 20 times the genetic differences between racial groups.</p>
<p>Tiny genetic differences can have huge phenotypic consequences because genes are ordered in a hierarchical fashion. Some genes are &#8220;master genes,&#8221; and control the expression of a number of other genes, each of which may further control several other genes. Also, the expression of each gene is controlled by regions called &#8220;promoters&#8221; and &#8220;enhancers,&#8221; usually located in front of the functional part of the gene. A small change in the promoter region of gene &#8220;X&#8221; can alter its expression. X may control genes A, B, C, D, E, F. Gene A in turn may control its own set of genes. Even if all of the genes other than &#8220;X&#8221; are identical between two groups, the one difference in &#8220;X&#8221; would be sufficient to produce large group differences.</p>
<p>It is not the quantity of genetic difference that is important, but the nature of the differences: which genes are different, in what ways they differ, and the consequences of these differences. Breeds of dogs are analogous to human races. It is likely that different breeds are as close genetically as different races of humans, but there is no doubt that these subtle variations result in significant differences in appearance, intelligence, and behavior.</p>
<p>It is also worth considering that a butterfly and the caterpillar from which it developed are 100 percent genetically identical! The genes do not change; the enormous differences between caterpillar and butterfly result from the activation of different genes at different times. This should give some pause to those who think a 0.1 percent difference in tens of thousands of human genes &#8220;makes no difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;There is more genetic variation within human groups than between groups; therefore, group differences are invalid.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is another very popular argument that, although true, does not at all mean that race is of no significance. The flaw in this argument is the same as in the &#8220;99.9 percent argument,&#8221; in that it stresses quantity  &mdash;  genetic &#8220;bean counting&#8221;  &mdash;  rather than the importance of genetic differences and their consequences. Indeed, there is more genetic variation within groups than between groups, but if this variation does not influence the expression of important genes, it is not of much consequence. There is considerable genetic variation between siblings and between parents and children, but this does not alter the fact that they are more closely related to each other than to strangers.</p>
<p>Once again Prof. Whitney has demonstrated the absurdity of the &#8220;variation&#8221; argument. He points out that one could take the total genetic diversity contained within the population of Belfast and a troop of macaque monkeys and give it an index of 100 percent. Surprising as it may seem, more than half of that diversity will be found both in the population of Belfast and in the monkey troop. There is great genetic diversity even between two individuals who are very similar to each other. This does not, of course, mean that Irishmen are more like macaques than they are like their neighbors, though this is precisely the way the there-are-no-races advocates use the argument when they apply it to humans.</p>
<p>Prof. Whitney explains that just as in the case of the genetic differences between men and women, &#8220;the meaningful question about racial differences is not the percentage of total diversity, but rather how the diversity is distributed among the races, what traits it influences, and how it is patterned.&#8221; Small genetic differences can translate into important physical and behavioral differences.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Population variation is continuous and human traits vary across a spectrum, so discrete racial entities do not exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a scientific way of saying that since hybrids (racially or ethnically mixed populations) exist, no single race exists. This is an amazingly popular argument, even though it is easily refuted. No one has ever thought the existence of hybrid populations of animals means these animals cannot be classified into distinct groups. This is self-evident. Your dog may be a mix of German Shepherd and Great Dane, but this does not mean there are no German Shepherds or Great Danes. The existence of dog hybrids means only that different breeds of dog can mate and produce offspring. Dogs and wolves  &mdash;  separate species  &mdash;  can mate and produce offspring but it is still easy to tell a dog from a wolf.</p>
<p>There are certainly places in which there has been much human mixing and where there are racial gradients  &mdash;  Central Asia, Latin America, North Africa. The existence of hybrid populations in these areas in no way disproves the existence of other populations that are genetically more differentiated  &mdash;  in Europe, the Far East, and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This &#8220;continuous variation&#8221; argument is so illogical it is a wonder anyone takes it seriously. The existence of mixtures does not invalidate the existence of the original components of mixtures. The fact that red and yellow can be mixed to produce orange hardly means that red and yellow are illusions or do not exist. Although racial gradation is far from being a perfect and continuous gradient, even those variations in nature that do lie along such a gradient can be classified into distinct groups. The continuous variation of light frequencies in the rainbow, for example, are easily grouped into the distinct colors that virtually all people recognize.</p>
<p>* &#8220;All human populations are mongrels, there is no such thing as a pure race; thus, there is no such thing as race.&#8221;</p>
<p>This argument is related to the previous one, except that it says we are all hybrids, so there is no such thing as race. First, no scientists talk about &#8220;pure&#8221; races. What does racial &#8220;purity&#8221; mean, anyway? It is true that certain populations are more genetically differentiated and distinct than are other more hybridized groups. If we consider Englishmen, Central Asians, and Koreans, we can make the relative statement that Koreans and Englishmen are more genetically (and phenotypically) distinct and differentiated than Central Asians, who are in some respects intermediate between East Asians and Europeans.</p>
<p>This does not imply that either Koreans or Englishmen are &#8220;pure,&#8221; which would presumably mean they can all trace their ancestries to a single population at a certain time. The English, for example, are a predominantly Nordic population made up of Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Normans/Vikings, Romans, and possibly early Mediterraneans. Many European groups are similarly composed of multiple related strains; if having an ancestry of different but relatively similar European groups makes someone a &#8220;mongrel,&#8221; then indeed we are all mongrels. But this does not invalidate in any way the concept of race, or the fact that the various &#8220;mongrel&#8221; populations are still genetically and phenotypically distinct from each other and thus are separate races. Both genetically and physically, Englishmen clearly belong in the European group and Koreans in the Northeast Asian group.</p>
<p>The &#8220;we are all mongrels&#8221; arguments fails in two ways. First, the various stocks that have gone into producing many of today&rsquo;s ethnic groups were relatively similar to each other, so it stretches the definition of the word to call them &#8220;mongrels.&#8221; How different were the Anglo-Saxons from the Celts? Likewise, would a person of mixed English and German ancestry be considered a &#8220;mongrel?&#8221; French-Italian? Do we call the millions of white Americans of mixed European stock &#8220;mongrels?&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, mixtures of related stocks can stabilize over time, and form a new, unique, and separate ethnic group, race, or breed. Such is the case with the various European ethnic groups, formed by mixtures of related ethnic strains. Europeans could be bred for hundreds  &mdash;  perhaps thousands  &mdash;  of generations without producing offspring that look like Africans or Asians. The reverse is also true. Even if today&rsquo;s races are the result of ancient mixtures the mixtures are distinct and extremely stable.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Population differences are superficial and only skin-deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is simply not true. Many consistent group differences have been found in intelligence, behavior, brain size, resistance to disease, twinning rates, speed of maturation, etc. Prof. Arthur Jensen has gathered irrefutable proof of racial differences in average intelligence. In Race, Evolution and Behavior Prof. Philippe Rushton has not only documented the large number of other racial differences but shown how they fit the varying reproduction strategies followed by different racial groups. Sometimes the race-does-not-exist argument appears to be a desperate attempt to shut down the argument about racial differences that the left has clearly lost. Since egalitarians have nothing to say in the face of mountains of evidence for racial differences, they have suddenly shifted their ground and try to pretend that race itself does not exist.</p>
<p>Even the most anti-racist medical doctors recognize that transplant donors and recipients often have to be matched not just on the basis of race but on close ethnicity within race, because inter-racial transplants are likely to be rejected. They also know that people of different races react differently do the same drugs and suffer from different diseases. To say these differences are only &#8220;skin-deep&#8221; is completely at odds with reality.</p>
<p>* &#8220;There has not been enough time for racial differences to have evolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an odd argument because there has clearly been enough time for physical differences to evolve. Pygmies and Norwegians presumably once had a common ancestor but are now so different from each other a biologist from another planet might well think them different species. This argument therefore is an attempt to deny differences in average intelligence or other mental traits. In <cite>Why Race Matters</cite> Professor Michael Levin shows that the IQ difference between Europeans and black Africans has had more than enough time to develop during the estimated 4,400 generations since the two groups split from a common ancestor. According to his calculation,</p>
<p>it would have required a rate of selection per generation of 0.000106 against recessive genes, a very small rate of genetic change that is the equivalent to a change in 11 individuals per 100,000 per generation. In nature this is an extremely slow rate of evolutionary change.</p>
<p>* &#8220;The white race  &mdash;  like all the others  &mdash;  is a social construct.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we begin to see the motivation behind all of the &#8220;there is no such thing as race&#8221; nonsense. If people of European descent can be convinced that race does not exist, in particular that their race does not really exist, there will be no resistance to the displacement of whites by the forces currently at work in America, Europe, and elsewhere. People will not defend something they have been convinced is not real.</p>
<p>If  &mdash;  against their own instincts and the clear evidence of their senses  &mdash;  whites can be made to think race is an illusion they can have no reason to oppose across-the-board integration, miscegenation, and massive non-white immigration. If whites are mixing with and being displaced by people who are really no different from themselves nothing is being lost.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that when it comes to &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;  &mdash;  policies that penalize whites  &mdash;  the very people who say race is a social construct insist that it is a valid basis for preferential treatment. People who say race is not biological somehow have no difficulty claiming to be &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;Asian&#8221; or &#8220;American Indian&#8221; if there is an advantage in doing so.</p>
<p>Nor in the vast majority of cases is there the slightest disagreement about who belongs in which race. Children can distinguish race unerringly by the age of two or three. Nature is parsimonious and does not often endow its creatures with senses to distinguish things that do not matter. An inborn ability, acquired at a very early age, of who are &#8220;our people&#8221; and who are not is essential to group survival. Any attempt to override or downplay that ability is a direct attack on the group itself.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is only whites who parrot obviously absurd notions about race and who pretend that indifference or even disloyalty to race is a virtue. Non-whites have a healthy consciousness of race and know that it is a fundamental part of individual and group identity. They must be hugely amused by the potentially suicidal silliness they hear whites urging each other to believe.</p>
<p>The claims of certain demagogues notwithstanding, Europeans are both a cultural and a biological reality. Like all racial and ethnic groups they have the right to preserve that reality and to resist efforts to obfuscate science in an attempt to eliminate races in fact, as well as name.</p>

		<p>If &#8220;race&#8221; is a &#8220;social construct&#8221; why is it known that certain medicines work &#8220;better&#8221; on one particular race and has less efficacy on those of other races?<br>
Of course, there are those in the medical and educational establishments that will downplay that FACT.<br>
Differences between the races do not necessarily mean inferiority or superiority of one race over another, but merely acknowledge that THERE ARE DIFFERENCES that need to be explored.</p>

		<p>The canard that &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; is about as true as the canard that &#8220;truth is a social construct&#8221; and that &#8220;species is a social construct&#8221; and that &#8220;humanity is a social construct&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>The seldom congruent arguments that support that claim boil down to the fact that all the above concepts are expressions of language that we use, which, undoubtedly, is a social construct. The problem with this approach is that a statement &#8220;x is a social construct&#8221; becomes tautology for many x&rsquo;s (like &#8220;race,&#8221; &#8220;species,&#8221; etc.) so that the information content in it is zero. In particular, it cannot settle any question or be considered evidence in a dispute.</p>
<p>(The argument of genetic closeness if invalid; different species may share 99 percent of genes. Also, it&rsquo;s like claiming that there is no difference between two software programs that differ only in few instructions - a patented absurdity.) </p>
<p>The above illustrates a typical &#8220;Liberal&#8221; line of &#8220;reasoning&#8221;: a trivial fallacy hidden in a convoluted system of distractions. Out of very many &#8220;Liberals&#8221; that I met in my life, each and every one of them was eager to commit this kind of error. Michael Savage has claimed that &#8220;Liberalism&#8221; is a mental disease, and certainly that hypothesis explains a lot.</p>

		<p>My dear Liberal friends,</p>
<p>Please quit saying &#8220;race is a myth&#8221; or &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; while you turn right around and call &#8216;whites&rsquo; racists, think all &#8216;blacks&rsquo; are victims, and support race-based affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Your average liberal race-denier is not used to thinking logically about race so you have to nudge him a little. First ask him what came first, anti-racism or multiculturalism. He usually won&rsquo;t know so inform him it was the latter. Now ask him whether it would make any difference in modern society if multiculturalism had come before anti-racism. Surely it would and ask him how things would look today as a result. In sociology this is called the principle of reflexivity.</p>
<p>For a race-denier, a thought experiment is to ask him what should be done if race in fact does exist. Remind him that a principle of sociology is that modern societies have a dilemma distinguishing between facts and values. It is very difficult to set new values without also contriving supporting facts. If you can&rsquo;t use the myth of race as a supporting fact then how do you tell people to ignore race? </p>

		<p>No sane person could possibly believe there is no such thing as race.  Race is so obvious in behavior and appearance that I don&rsquo;t believe it is open to genuine scientific debate.</p>
<p>The Left is not interested in social justice.  Not at all.  They are interested reshaping the West, particularly Europe and America.  They want a new world order and the destruction or at least reshaping America, Canada, and Europe (historically white societies) are essential to a redistribution of wealth and power.</p>
<p>Insisting race does not exist is just part of a ploy to get whites to go along with  their demise.  The other part of the ploy is to convince white societies that they are evil, selfish, and racist.  The Left never sees the contradiction, but sadly neither do many whites that support the Leftist agenda.</p>

		<p>If race is a social construct alone, then rap music could just as easily evolved from Chinese or Europeans and the Renaissance or Taoism could just as easily have sprung from the Congo, or white people (can) dance or jump. In fact we are all human, just as all languages are forms of communication, but as in the different languages there is more to the variation than outward form so it is with the different races. These different races are the real treasures of diversity that should not only be tolerated but preserved. This does not mean though,.. in my mind, that people of any gentic configuration, or any state of gentic mix etc. are less human and thus of less divine essence than any other more specific type. Though not to be abused, compassion is a requirment in being human. </p>

		<p>If race is such a myth and a social construct, then why are whites the only ones that are accused of racism? Why is there affirmative action for non-whites if we&rsquo;re all the same?</p>
<p>If you were to ask these types of questions to a liberal, they would go speechless and would struggle for an answer, and the answer they would give would make no sense at all.</p>

		<p>Oh, how they must howl with laughter at the way we white people prepare the way for our own destruction in so many ways . They have watched as over the past four decades we have been persuaded to tesch our own children the absurd notions that racial differences do not exist, even that races do not exist.  Again and again as the madness consumes our nation I am reminded of the story of &#8221; The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes &#8221; .  We can be so easily taught to disregard the evidence of our own experience. Can it be that some people are beginning to wake up ?  </p>

		<p>Like many White people, I once thought that the only difference between the races was the color of skin. After all, I had been taught this in school as well as by the many television programs which either directly or indirectly promote this idea of racial equality.<br>
However, as I grew older, I came to think twice about this idea, and as I learned more about the world (I had an avid interest in history), it became clear to me that if the races were truly &#8220;equal&#8221;, they would have contributed to the world equally. Also, it became clear to me in my contacts with other races that the other races did not think or act the same as White people. There was a definite difference between us and I later learned that these differences are caused by biological differences.<br>
White men had brains 8.2% larger than those of Black men, while White women had brains 8.1% larger than those of Black women. <br>
It is not racist to state the biological fact that the White race possesses more intellectual capability than the other races any more than it is hatred to state that humans possess more intellectual capability than animals and some animals possess more intellectual capability than other animals. Science has nothing to do with hatred, but with reality.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious about something.  Would some liberal explain on here why DNA from a crime scene can determine the race of a perpetrator?  Why certain medications are only effective with certain races?  Why certain diseases only affect specific races?  Why bone marrow and certain organ transplants are not racially interchangable?  How is it possible for something as artificial as a social construct have an effect on the physical world?     <br>

		<p>Its also true that all fish share 99.9% of the same genes as do  birds, ants and bees etc. The difference is they all hang around with their own species. </p>
<p>Is it just a coincidence that 99.9999% of whites came from Europe or its borders or reds and yellows came from Asia or blacks from Africa?   </p>
<p>Isnt it true that the original race who all turned bad was wiped out by a flood who were all the same color? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Current evidence suggests that all the sex differences between men and women are the result of just one genetic difference &mdash; one gene (the Testes Determining Factor) out of an estimated 50,000-100,000!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not quite, Mike.  The Testes Determining Factor (TDF) is found on the Y-chromosome and is responsible for the testes (which were created by other genes) descending, thus creating male hormones.  It&rsquo;s the Y-chromosome itself that&rsquo;s responsible for creating males, not just one gene.</p>
<p>That being said, there is an abundance of evidence to suggest that H. sapiens is polytypic (i.e. has subspecies or races).</p>
<p>This paper was published by a biologist from the prestigious Royal Holloway college at the University of London.  I&rsquo;d pay more attention to it than any statement from the talking heads and hacks in the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Like many White people, I once thought that the only difference between the races was the color of skin. After all, I had been taught this in school as well as by the many television programs which either directly or indirectly promote this idea of racial equality.<br>
However, as I grew older, I came to think twice about this idea, and as I learned more about the world (I had an avid interest in history), it became clear to me that if the races were truly &ldquo;equal&rdquo;, they would have contributed to the world equally. Also, it became clear to me in my contacts with other races that the other races did not think or act the same as White people. There was a definite difference between us and I later learned that these differences are caused by biological differences.<br>
White men had brains 8.2% larger than those of Black men, while White women had brains 8.1% larger than those of Black women.<br>
It is not racist to state the biological fact that the White race possesses more intellectual capability than the other races any more than it is hatred to state that humans possess more intellectual capability than animals and some animals possess more intellectual capability than other animals. Science has nothing to do with hatred, but with reality.</p>

Apparently, the Modern Human (Homo Sapiens) has a smaller brain than Neanderthal Man, who, we are told, were less sophisticated than Modern Humans.</p>

		<p>After the human genome project the main stream media concluded that race is a social construct, but the conclusion was faulty, as the human genome project only decoded one human genome and this genome consisted of snippets of code from multiple donours. Thus scientifically no meaningful conclusions could be made. This however did not stop the main stream media from promoting their political agenda, which entails promoting anything to do with multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>Since 2001 however the study into the human genome has not stopped. In 2007 the Hapmap project concluded. This project entailed the de-coding of 270 human genomes from 270 different people from different races. These findings were made public.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that it was proven that there is a 12% copy number variation between the races and a 20-30% SNP difference between the races.</p>
<p>The 99.9% similarity as concluded by the main stream media was based on SNP, thus you can see for yourself how very, very incorrect they were, given that today we know the genetic SNP difference to be between 20-30%.</p>
<p>If the human genome could be represented as a book, the a single SNP difference would be a word that is spelled incorrectly and a single CNV difference would be a WHOLE PAGE that is different and we know today that there is a 12% CNV difference between the races.</p>
<p>Tbe fact that this is not widely known, is a testiment to the bias of the main stream media. </p>

		<p>I want to share a great news. According to Russian media from the inner circles of the IOC: Chicago and Rio de Janeiro did have the best chances until the Obamas came over. The silent but firm scorn people have outside the USA to the couple was so powerful and unifying that there was no need in any conspiracy to throw Chicago out. <br>

		<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t have the background to understand the argument, &#8220;genetic variation within a group is greater than the genetic variation between groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I hope I won&rsquo;t be too off base to counter that argument when it&rsquo;s thrown at me by saying that it seems analogous to the fact that there is only a 10 or 15 point difference in average IQ between blacks and whites, even though there is a spread of many more IQ points than that in each group&hellip;but so what.</p>

<p>Another people need to keep in mind is that scientists make &#8220;discoveries&#8221; based on who is paying their bills.  </p>

		<p>A few points:</p>
<p>If the existence of separate races has been scientifically proven beyond a shadow of a doubt then this point should be hammered home constantly by white advocates. The research should be boiled down to concise points of argument, with supporting online documentation just a link away. Every white advocate should know these points and feel confident when entering into debate over them, knowing that the science is there to back him or her up.</p>
<p>If the existence of separate races has not been scientifically proven conclusively, then this should be a high priority for activism by white advocates. Any extra dollars floating around out there should go towards more research. We should want to settle this question, we should want to know the truth - even if there&rsquo;s the possibility that we won&rsquo;t like the results. The strength of the &#8220;racial realist&#8221; position is that it is unafraid to face truths that leftist ideologues want to sweep under the rug. People can sense when they are being lied to, and they sense the truth of what &#8220;racial realists&#8221; are saying. Respect is gained by upholding the truth, even unpopular truths.</p>
<p>Last point: Even if the scientifically proven existence of race remains a controversial point, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that white advocates can&rsquo;t take head on the &#8220;race is a construct&#8221; position. &#8220;Cultural constructs&#8221; are VERY real -  minorities fuss constantly that their cultures should be recognized and respected - and white advocates have a winning argument when the say that white American culture has just as much right to exist as any other ethnic/racial group.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;If race is such a myth and a social construct, then why are whites the only ones that are accused of racism? Why is there affirmative action for non-whites if we&rsquo;re all the same?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As more and more genetic information comes to light, it is becoming increasingly difficult for lefties to preach the ridiculous canard that &#8220;Race is a Social Construct!&#8221; without being openly laughed at.</p>
<p>Eventually, it was proved that the Earth was neither Flat nor the Center of the Universe  &mdash;  anyone who so believes that today would be looked upon as either profoundly stupid or mentally ill.</p>
<p>Hostile elites disseminated the ridiculous racial equality canard via the msm, academia and the government until it became the prevailing wisdom of every government and academic policy.  To question the false wisdom of racial equality is to open oneself to charges of racism and Nazism and to risk one&rsquo;s career and reputation.</p>
<p>The hostile elite have such a strangle hold on Whites that even the author of this article had to use a pseudonym lest he be outed as a racist and White supremecist and lose his position.</p>
<p>But, as radical egalitarianism becomes more and more laughable and the Emperor realizes that he has no clothes, the lefties have another plan waiting in the wings:  Hate Speech laws which will make questioning racial equality very very risky, if not impossible, subjecting one to real prison time, as has already happened in Europe.</p>

		<p>Sure, &#8220;race&#8221; itself is biological (i.e. non-cultural), but the issue doesn&rsquo;t stop there; another question is, how will these biological realities be manipulated by human beings? </p>
<p>Clearly, this author advances his own answer in the last part: biological reality will help serve &#8216;whites&rsquo; by providing an intellectual basis for resistance. </p>
<p>The real issue, therefore, is not so much &#8216;race&rsquo; but the manipulation of biological ties by humans themselves   &mdash;   in other words, it is the INTERPLAY between biological reality and self-serving human manipulation. This is exactly where I depart from Amren. Amren is very eager to lump &#8216;whites&rsquo; together for its own self-serving purposes; Amreners love to emphasize the differences between Europeans &#8216;as a group&rsquo; against all other peoples, but are very quick to minimize the differences between Europeans themselves. Believe it or not, this is every bit as manipulative and self-serving as the rhetoric employed by the most fanatical multicultual liberal. The difference is just a matter of direction. In other words, if denying all significant differences is the manipulation by the multicult types, affirming a &#8216;pan-European&rsquo; unity is the manipulation of Amren types. </p>
<p>FYI, crossings between Italians and English, or Hungarians and Swedes, is just as much miscegenation if the situation involved Arabs and Swedes, or some other group. The different European ethnic groups are stabilized blends that display a racial &#8216;average&rsquo; type. They are different and unequal. Homogenizing them together is every bit as undesirable as homogenization of the entire human population. This might displease some Americans who are ethnically and culturally mixed, but it&rsquo;s still true nonetheless. There is absolutely no reason to homogenize the European peoples into a mixed salad blend in the name of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I hear the argument all the time that there are no such thing as &#8220;pure&#8221; races, therefore, the whole concept of race is invalidated. The argument about dog breeds brilliantly refutes this spurious claim. Even though dogs can be interbred, that does not negate the existence of purebreds. The other flimsy arguments about race are burst equally well by this article.</p>

<p>Yes, I hear that argument too. The most interesting thing is that it is invariably advanced by those who have a personal axe to grind. (They&rsquo;re not  &#8220;pure&#8221; and they don&rsquo;t want you to be either.)  These people have an agenda to serve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to be one zillion percent &#8220;pure&#8221;, but  I know &#8220;pure&#8221; when I see it. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>

<p>Your lefty-lib opponents will sneeringly dismiss that argument with the response that whites are dominant everywhere in the world and that any silly fears about their &#8220;right to exist&#8221; are sheer racist paranoia.  Utter, fantastic nonsense!  You&rsquo;re crazy to imagine it.</p>
<p><br>
You have to be prepared to counter with hard facts about white percentages of world population, birthrates, etc.  It&rsquo;s not just those lifty-libs who will scoff.  MOST people, in fact, are unprepared to believe that whites are in any sort of tenuous position at all.   It&rsquo;s inconceivable. It is simply taken for granted that whites are in control and always will be.  Most people haven&rsquo;t given it a thought. And those who rely on the MSM for their information never will. It&rsquo;s an unmentionable topic.</p>

		<p>Inevitably (I hope),  science will prevail. But, as Bon says, the hostile elites are prepared to fall back on Plan B when that happens.  </p>
<p>They will make any discussion of the topic very risky, if not outright prohitited. Unless you mouth the &#8220;right&#8221; things that agree with the officially approved wisdom, you will face jail time, personal disgrace, financial and professional ruin. Very few people will have the courage to go against that.</p>
<p>In many countries Plan B is already being put into place at this moment.</p>
