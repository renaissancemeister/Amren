<h1>Judge Orders Fathima Rifqa Bary to Return to Ohio</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy L. Edwards, Orlando Sentinel, October 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fathima Rifqa Bary, the Ohio teenage runaway whose story of Muslim-to-Christianity conversion and charges of family abuse sparked debates about personal freedom, is going back to her home state.</p>
<p>Three months after Rifqa took a Greyhound bus to Orlando and sought shelter with pastors she had never met, an Orange County Circuit judge on Friday ordered the Florida Department of Children and Families to send the girl back to Ohio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dawson [Orange County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Dawson] last week decided Rifqa&rsquo;s case belonged in an Ohio court and asked that lawyers provide documentation regarding her education and immigration before he sent her home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teen has been living with a foster family in Central Florida. Ohio officials have indicated that she will be placed with a foster family in that state. It is not clear when  &mdash;  or if  &mdash;  she will live with her own family again.</p>
<p>Rifqa&rsquo;s father, Mohamed Bary, was laughing and giddy during a brief Friday afternoon phone call with the Orlando Sentinel. He would not comment, though, citing a gag order.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rifqa has been in Central Florida since she ran away from her Columbus-area home in mid-July. Her story became public when a custody battle ensued in an Orange County courtroom, and it quickly gained national media attention because of her allegations against her Muslim father.</p>
<p>The petite girl, who was 16 when she ran away, said she feared Mohamed Bary would harm or kill her because she converted to Christianity.</p>
<p>Investigators in Florida and Ohio have found no credible threats against Rifqa, and her family has also denied such threats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her first two weeks in Orlando she lived with Blake and Beverly Lorenz, longtime Central Florida pastors whom she met through a Christian group on the social networking site Facebook.</p>
<p>On Aug. 10  &mdash;  her 17th birthday  &mdash;  an Orange County judge ordered her into DCF emergency custody. She has been in foster care in Central Florida since.</p>
<p>On Friday, Jamal Jivanjee, who used to pastor a church in the Columbus area and is one of Rifqa&rsquo;s friends and supporters, said the teen does not want to return to Ohio.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s a strong girl by nature,&#8221; said Jivanjee, who now directs a Christian ministry in Tennessee. But he said, &#8220;She is definitely fearful. She is fearful about going back.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the white race continues to appear weak and indifferent to encroachment, foreigners will wear their nationalistic pride in our midst.</p>
<p>If white nationalism becomes popular, foreigners will be &#8216;converting&rsquo; to Western creed and &#8216;embracing&rsquo; Western culture.</p>
<p>Either way, they want permanently into white civilization.</p>

		<p>Missing in any of this is a discussion of why these people are in the US in the first place?  How has Muslim immigration helped America?  If these people were never allowed in, this would not be an issue at all.  This is just one more example of how multiculturalism destroyed America.  Notice I say destroyed&hellip;it&rsquo;s all past tense, now.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Courts claim &ldquo;no credible evidence&rdquo; Muslim father would kill his daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, isn&rsquo;t that just plain insane to make such a claim, just because it happens so often in similar circumstances within most all Muslim communities worldwide?</p>
<p>If he just stomps on her head and disfigures her instead of committing murder, will he be regarded as the epitome of tolerance?</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t see why White Nationalists would have a problem with this.  We are fighting for racial separation, not trying to convert Muslims to Christianity.  </p>

		<p>her life is in imminent danger!</p>
<p>I live in Germany: I once had a two different groups of Muslims weeping and wailing at my doorstep because their 16 y o daughter had &#8220;disappeared,&#8221; and they were concerned that she might be in danger.</p>
<p>(my neighbor knew her, she was avoiding them)</p>
<p>it turns out they weren&rsquo;t trying to marry her to some uncleat years older back in the home country (probably for money), and she had run away to avoid her fate.</p>
<p>when dealing with Muslims, expect the unexpected:<br>
you have just jumped into a time machine and gone backwards a thousand years or so.</p>

		<p>   You can count on Islam to undo all the advances that women have made in the last fifty years. Women&rsquo;s status will decline to levels not seen in centuries.  Are feminists resisting the transformation of Europe into a Muslim continent? NO, political correctness/anti-racism trumps feminist ideology.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t this girl just wait until she was 18 years old?  Isn&rsquo;t she pretty close to being 18.  </p>
<p>Why are we even dealing with this kind of stuff in this country?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be silly!  This is a cult she has gotten involved with. It is even worse than Islam. The church of global revolution? What? </p>
<p>It is anti-white, pro-diversity and contrary to everything Amreners stand for.  I wouldn&rsquo;t get involved with either side. This is simply a non-issue.  Find another cause to sorry about!</p>

<p>The folks at AmRen highlighted this to show exactly WHY we need racial separation.  &#8220;Honor killings&#8221; are what we can expect to become the norm here when these peoples (Muslims) reach critical mass in our society.  We&rsquo;re already witnessing that in the UK.</p>

<p>Lebanese Christians are apparently leaving the country of their ancestors to get away from the Muslims.  Sound familiar?</p>
