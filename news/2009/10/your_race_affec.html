			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Christian," oktrends, October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When I first started looking at first-contact attempts and who was writing who back, it was immediately obvious that the sender&rsquo;s race was a huge factor. Here are just a handful of the numbers that illustrate that:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="500"><img src="/news/2009/10/06/writing-back.jpg" alt="writing-back"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The takeaway here is that although race shouldn&rsquo;t matter in messaging, it does. A lot.</p>
<p><b>More Compatibility Means More Replies (Normally)</b></p>
<p>First of all, how do we know that race shouldn&rsquo;t matter? Are we just making some after-school-special assumption that &#8220;true love is colorblind?&#8221; No, we&rsquo;re not: we know race shouldn&rsquo;t matter to replies because the races all match each other more or less evenly, and reply rate correlates to matching.</p>
<p>On OkCupid you create your own unique matching system, and that means your better matches are people you actually want talk to. Below is a graph showing match percentages vs. reply rates for a random sample of 500,000 people. As you can see, in general, the better you match someone, the more likely you are to reply to a first message from them.</p>
<p>We can see this principle in action when we look at our trusty control, the Zodiac. Here are the match and reply rates side-by-side, with similar rates colored yellow. There&rsquo;s no real need to inspect the numbers; just observe the similar colors.</p>
<p>People of the various Zodiac signs match each other all at roughly the average rate, and, as we would expect, they <em>reply to messages similarly.</em> In general, the correlation between match percentage and reply rate means that whenever we compare the match/reply charts for a given breakdown of the population, they should look about the same. However, this, like so many other fine assumptions, totally breaks down when race gets involved:</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t bother squinting, just check out the colors. We&rsquo;ll now look very closely at these tables.</p>
<p><b>The Race Is On</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Here&rsquo;s what we know:</p>
<p><b>* Black women are sweethearts. </b>Or just talkative. But either way, they are by far the most likely to reply to your first message. In many cases, their response rate is one and a half times the average, and overall black women reply about a quarter more often.</p>
<p><b>* White men get more responses. </b>Whatever it is, white males just get more replies from almost every group. We were careful to preselect our data pool so that physical attractiveness (as measured by our site picture-rating utility) was roughly even across all the race/gender slices. For guys, we did likewise with height.</p>
<p><b>* White women prefer white men to the exclusion of everyone else  &mdash;  and Asian and Hispanic women prefer them even more exclusively. </b>These three types of women <em>only</em> respond well to white men. More significantly, these groups&rsquo; reply rates to non-whites is terrible. Asian women write back non-white males at 21.9%, Hispanic women at 22.9%, and white women at 23.0%. It&rsquo;s here where things get interesting, for white women in particular. If you look at the match-by-race table before this one, the &#8220;should-look-like&#8221; one, you see that white women have an above-average compatibility with almost every group. Yet they only reply well to guys who look like them. There&rsquo;s more data on this towards the end of the post.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens when it&rsquo;s the women writing the messages to men.</p>
<p><b>* Men don&rsquo;t write black women back. </b>Or rather, they write them back far less often than they should. Black women reply the most, yet get by far the fewest replies. Essentially every race  &mdash;  <em>including other blacks</em>  &mdash;  singles them out for the cold shoulder.</p>
<p><b>* White guys are shitty, but fairly even-handed about it. </b>The average reply rate of non-white males is 48.1%, while white guys&rsquo; is only 40.5%. Basically, they write back about 20% less often. It&rsquo;s ironic that white guys are worst responders, because as we saw above they get the most replies. That has apparently made them very self-absorbed. It&rsquo;s interesting that white males do manage to reply to Middle Eastern women. Is there some kind of emergent fetish there? As Middle Easterners are becoming America&rsquo;s next racial bogeyman, maybe there&rsquo;s some kind of forbidden fruit thing going on. {snip}</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here where things get interesting, for white women in particular. If you look at the match-by-race table before this one, the &ldquo;should-look-like&rdquo; one, you see that white women have an above-average compatibility with almost every group. Yet they only reply well to guys who look like them. There&rsquo;s more data on this towards the end of the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I think the disparities in these sets of data, reflect the conflicts that arise when abjectly malevolent propaganda (and what else is multiculturalism and its primary goal of white genocide via miscegenation, but totally wretched and diabolical cant) runs into the hard wall of reality. The United States is a Western society of the first tier; our culture and our people are (and can only be) based on the genetic and temperamental characteristics of Europeans. Yes, there are some differences between our country and the continent and its islands, but primarily we are the branches and roots of the same tree. </p>
<p>This is a fundamental truth that is reflected in both broad and personal social terms/trends. Thus, it should be no surprise that while the officially expected multicultural responses to any survey are given robotically by whites, when the actual fact of living them reduces to a personal choice, whites (at least the normal ones) tend to seek out their own. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist or brain surgeon to figure out why whites primarily seek out other whites to date or marry, even through computer matchmaking services. </p>
<p>That white women may respond more frequently than white men in general, is probably a reflection of the normal gender roles being somewhat equalized or even inverted on such websites. After all, men are used to seeking out and requesting romance, while women accept and reject in most other circumstances. On such websites as this OkCupid, anonymity offers an opportunity for some gender role reversal; or put another way, white men have more options in the accept or reject category. </p>
<p>There are other speculations and interpretations that I could make, but I think I will end them here for now, </p>

		<p>Regarding the last part about White men getting the most replies, but responding about 20% less of the time.  I wonder if there is a difference in the absolute number of replies given by White males?  The thought behind my question is that White males don&rsquo;t have any more time to respond than others, and thus, they can&rsquo;t respond to an equal percentage of their more numerous emails.  It&rsquo;s good that White women prefer White men to the exclusion of everyone else.  If that&rsquo;s not the case, there can&rsquo;t be a future that includes White people.  I know the non-Whites and traitors lament this.  </p>

		<p>The author is jerk who somehow finds himself in a position of authority to tell people, especially white men, who they SHOULD be replying to and what that reply rate should be.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s good to see that most white men and women are showing some semblance of racial solidarity. I don&rsquo;t think most are as miscegenistic as many are lead to believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to our internal metrics, at least, OkCupid&rsquo;s users are better-educated, younger, and far more progressive than the norm, so I can imagine that many sites would actually have worse race stats.&#8221;</p>
<p>More non-sense. Everywhere I look, it&rsquo;s those &#8220;better-educated&#8221; and more intelligent folks that choose to stick to their own.</p>

		<p>Young white men, you are in demand!  Even though you are disparaged by academia, the media, and many of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;czars,&#8221; other races secretly desire your beautiful genes, intellect and achievements. </p>
<p>Now, please be aware that it is probably not &#8220;YOU&#8221; personally these non-white women want, but the increased status they hope to achieve by being with a white man and having children who are better looking, smarter and possibly richer than they would be otherwise.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone use you and don&rsquo;t squander those rare, precious genes.  Only one race is able to make blue eyes, green eyes, blond hair, light brown hair, red hair, etc.  Only one race has invented almost everything in the modern age.  Only one race has championed the individual rather than the herd.</p>

		<p>I retired out of the military. It was not unusual for a solider to have a foreign born wife. What was unusual was to run across a women in the military  that had a foreign born husband. It seems that an American husband will treat their foreign wife the same wherever they are. But a foreign husband will treat their American wife one way in America and another way when he brings her back home. </p>

		<p>Being a white man really is great, I was on one of those stupid dating sites for about two weeks after I was bummed out from a break up and I got flooded with all kinds of responses from all kinds of women. </p>
<p>You could pick racial preferences which I originally had as &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; as a ploy to appear the paragon of equality and fairness but I got swamped by hispanic women nonstop until I checked the option for Caucasian only, and no change still got nonstop hispanic women. Like I am going to go up to the Bronx in the middle of the night to take some Dominican girl on a date and get stabbed by her latin king brother. Nahhh&hellip;.. Just ended up deleting the account and worked things out with my ex and lived happily ever after with my plain old white girlfriend.</p>

		<p>If &#8216;racism&rsquo; no longer exclusively refers to advocating or committing violence against people solely because of their skin color then it is no longer anything to be concerned about. Beyond that line, efforts to &#8216;eradicate&rsquo; &#8216;eliminate&rsquo; &#8216;stamp out&rsquo; racism transform into an assault on the basic human right of freedom of association. </p>

		<p>I found it most interesting that Indian men don&rsquo;t respond well to Indian women.  I guarantee that most Indian men on these sites are just there to find a white woman.  Indians are, by far, the most racist ethnic group I&rsquo;ve ever met, especially in relation to other Asian ethnic groups.  I saw a poll a few months ago that showed that Indians in Virginia voted around 80% for Obama.  Indians hate white males.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to skip the whole &#8220;Gee, I can&rsquo;t believe a libtard is trying to dictate our lives&#8221; argument, since I can believe it. In fact, it is to be expected, otherwise the fanciful dreams of the liberals would never come true.</p>
<p>Instead, I was wondering if anyone understood this lecturing socialist drivel enough to understand how the heck he established what the reply rate &#8220;should&#8221; be. He seems to be begging the question when he makes the statement: &#8220;&hellip;we know race shouldn&rsquo;t matter to replies because the races all match each other more or less evenly&hellip;&#8221; I saw no such proof that the races match each other evenly. Is the bit about the Zodiac signs supposed to support this claim? Because I can&rsquo;t see how astrological superstition can be compared with biological and cultural variation in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I&rsquo;m the idiot for thinking I could find a logical argument in a post that opens with: &#8220;Welcome back, dorks.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The way I see it, these statistics reflect the obvious racial loyalty that is genetically ingrained in everyone.</p>
<p>The fact that White males receive the most replies (ironic, considering how much we&rsquo;re emasculated and criticized in the West) is not surprising in the least. White men (on average when compared to other races, of course) are natural leaders, explorers, innovators, and most importantly, providers.</p>
<p>This article almost permeates with the subtle bitterness of the racial traitor/liberal who typed it. He seems to expect White women to abandon White men, on the basis of some deluded dream of &#8220;progress&#8221; and &#8220;equality.&#8221; It truly irritates me when I read this kind of nonsense, since it is always constructed so as to disparage White men and castigate White women for failing to live up to the miscegenation quotas. It is heartening, however, that even after fifty years of cultural Marxist indoctrination, most White women are still loyal to their male counterparts.</p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t suprise me if they were referring primarily to persian females, many of which could easily pass for white.</p>
<p>As for white males getting the most replies, can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m suprised.  Despite our portrayal as undesireable in virtually every form of media, somehow women of every race still seem to figure otherwise.  Probably something to do with recognition of the alpha male on a genetic level. </p>
<p>Funny, that.</p>

		<p>As usual, an observation of white behavior that becomes sinister because the complexity that proves it mostly reasonable is unnoticed by incompetent, simplifying investigators.</p>
<p>A few interesting comments from the source site that might, if you were not an idiot, suggest an explanation other than &#8220;racism&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I am very racist against Hispanic men IRL, because I ride the metro in LA and get nothing but constant catcalls and whistles from them. It&rsquo;s really gross.</i></p>
<p>Online, though, race doesn&rsquo;t affect my responses. I respond to the messages I feel a connection to, and that&rsquo;s that. However, I have noticed a lot of messages I get from black &amp; Latino guys here run something like, &ldquo;daym gurl u lookin fine, suk my c*ck.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not saying all messages from black &amp; Latino guys read this, of course, but in my experience&hellip; that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to go on here. I have dated and been attracted to men of literally every race and color, but I know that that&rsquo;s why MY response stats are skewed.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   Antithestasia</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;I think these results are likely to be massively skewed by the fact that there are a lot of men on OkCupid &mdash; mostly Asian men but also a few black men &mdash; who send generic messages like the following one (which, from the country code, is from a man in Nigeria):</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;realy liked what i read about u.would realy love to talk with u on phone.heres my cell number&hellip;+234**********&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..i must say i was impresed by ur profile,am quite new on this and will really like to hear from u.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, indeed, less subtle ones like this one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very gorgeos<br>
You have nice boobs<br>
and<br>
very sexy legs&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, those are messages I&rsquo;m not going to respond to. And broadly my experience has been that even though a few white men send messages like these, they are outnumbered by white men who send more appealing kinds of messages. I also note that these offputting messages are disproportionately sent by men who are actually living overseas.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   ophelia_in_red</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;You&rsquo;re missing a key piece of information, which is how message content correlates with race. Almost every message I&rsquo;ve gotten from a black male has been something like &ldquo;yo wat up sexy&rdquo; and we learned from a few blog posts ago that netspeak really kills your reply rate, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty of racism, but I know that for myself that&rsquo;s probably the biggest factor for why as a white female I reply to black males a lot less.&#8221;</i><br>
  &mdash;   Renee</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;Has anyone considered the question of how closely race aligns with culture, and how that affects these sorts of statistics? Personally, I haven&rsquo;t dated a lot of African American or Hispanic men, but it&rsquo;s not because of their race  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s because I simply haven&rsquo;t found I have much in common with them. I&rsquo;m white, upper middle class, working in technology, and I do musical theater for fun. That means I&rsquo;m much more likely to date Asian, Indian, and Caucasian men because I&rsquo;m much more likely to connect with them and feel we have things in common.&#8221;</i><br>
  &mdash;   Tanya</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;I am a white male. I have responded to 100% of the non-white women (that is, three blacks from Africa and two Philippinas) who have contacted me. All of the Africans turned out to be scammers, and I now assume that any &ldquo;African woman&rdquo; who contacts me is a scammer. The Philippinas were serious Christians (I am an atheist) with poor English language skills. Even if I was interested in these women, I know from experience how difficult and expensive it is to bring foreign women into the United States. There is no way I would want to go through that again.</i></p>
<p>As I noted above, I have responded to all of the non-white women who have contacted me, but I can understand why most men wouldn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t necessarily racism.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   Guy Fawkes</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;At the risk of stereotyping &hellip; in an earlier blog entry, you mentioned that text-isms like &ldquo;ur&rdquo; and &ldquo;wat&rdquo; are big turnoffs. It seems to me that African-American women (can&rsquo;t speak for the men, since I don&rsquo;t read their profiles) do this a LOT more in their profiles than other users.&#8221;</i><br>
  &mdash;   Catbus</p>

I wonder: if they actually asked people why they acted as they did instead of just drawing their own conclusions from the statistics, what proportion of the responses would be like these? But certainly, if enough of them were that whites began to appear reasonable, at once their validity would be questioned. <i>This is just an excuse for racism by people who cannot accept the truth, just like &#8220;I have a black friend&#8221;</i>, or <i>maybe you&rsquo;re not racist consciously, but subconsciously you are, because you&rsquo;ve absorbed the racism inherent in th&hellip;</i>blah blah blah unfalsifiable, disgusting means to invalidate anything a white person says.</p>

		<p>If I had a nickel for every time a Latina or southasian chick gave me the eye - and then the eye again - I&rsquo;d be one heck of a rich guy.  Alas, I moved to this urban area and got married so quickly - to an Indian chick.  (Really hot, by the way, and very aryan.)</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of Middle Easterners, northern Indians and northern Asians have a lot of genetic similarities to European extracted peoples.  Remember that the huge grasslands of Central Asia connected the two worlds for thousands of years and in the Middle East, the Greeks were all over the place, even as the Crusaders and others were there busy spreading their genes around.  Even a large portion of the so-called Hispanics are all or nearly all white.  So I do not consider it mycegenation if a white person marries someone from those types of backgrounds.  Heck, southern Italians are the original mixed race people with white, Arab and other groups mixed in.  Spain was an Arab dominated country for 700 years - that&rsquo;s 700 years folks - and almost all people from there are half to a quarter Arab or Berber.  </p>
<p>I think the most important thing we as Americans mustr focus on is preserving Western traditions and culture, rather than a shifting sense of racial purity.  Remember when Polish and Ukrainian people and Irish and Italians were considered non-white?</p>
<p>We need to convert the non-whites to our more advanced culture and ways.  Race will always shift slightly through the years.  We white people in America don&rsquo;t look like white people in Europe anymore.  Have you considered that?  But we shar a common cultural heritage, and that, my friends, is what can be preserved and expanded upon.  Think about it.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s sick is that White males are writing Asian and Hispanic females so much, and that these groups reply so vehemently. Between White women being lost to black men and White men being lost to Mestizos and Asians, I&rsquo;d say the gene pool has taken a 60% casualty rate in the last forty years. </p>

		<p>It appears that white men are highly sought after by women of all races. Let this be a lesson to white women who plan to sport f*** the exciting bad boys and players while they&rsquo;re young and hot and then wheel in a nice guy around 30, after their looks start to slide and they hear their biological clock start to tick. If they do that, the competition for the remaining decent white guys will be very stiff, and they&rsquo;ll likely grow old alone with no one to keep them company except for their 30 cats.</p>

<p>&hellip;.White women prefer white men to the exclusion of everyone else &mdash; and Asian and Hispanic women prefer them even more exclusively.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is obvious as White men on average are more handsome and attractive compared the men of all other races. Besides West African descended black and some Pacific islander males, they are manlier than the males of all other races.  And other than East Asian males, they make the best husbands compared to the males of all other races (especially blacks). Indeed White men have the best combination of qualities any sensible woman would want. So this is hardly surprising?</p>

		<p>I found it most interesting that Indian men don&rsquo;t respond well to Indian women. I guarantee that most Indian men on these sites are just there to find a white woman. Indians are, by far, the most racist ethnic group I&rsquo;ve ever met, especially in relation to other Asian ethnic groups.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I guarantee that Indians strongly stick with their own community. Look to Britain and you quickly realize that South Asian-white couples are very rare.  Indians are extremely arrogant and racist, especially against blacks. Never call an Indian black even when they are quite dark.</p>

<p>If Indians and Middle Easterners are White according to you then Obama is White too. Race is much more important than culture as once race purity is lost it is nearly impossible to get back. Culture can be regained back. Europe during the Middle Ages lost a lot of classical Greek culture and thought but regained them several centuries later thanks to the Irish monks who preserved them. Culture can be regained as long as the racial genes are maintained which medieval Europeans did maintain. </p>
<p>And even if American Whites do not look like European Whites (Due to the mixing of various White nationalities and wee bit of Native American genes), they still do not look like Arabs, Indians or Obama look alikes. They still look White, behave nearly like Europeans and have the same capabilities as Europeans. American and Canadian Whites have built a civilization which is as advanced as and is extremely similar to Europe. The same cannot be said of Arabs and Indians, though Northern Asians do build advanced but non-Western (and thus alien) civilizations.</p>
<p>  Why do you not ask Hindus if they would rather have India filled with White, Black and East Asian people living with Hindu culture or rather have genetic Asian Indians behaving as Whites, Africans or East Asians? <br>

<p>I must say that what you have written is complete rubbish, and has no bearing on my (and most of Amren&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure) opinion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider Indian women White, and definitely not Aryan. Do they have some &#8220;Aryan&#8221; genetic markers? I&rsquo;m sure they do, after all, the upper classes in India have been greatly influenced by the Indo-Aryan peoples, and later by the British.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t consider Middle Easterners of the same &#8220;extraction&#8221; as Europeans, and the only Mexicans I consider White are those who are directly descended from Europeans; mestizos don&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>The Irish were never considered &#8220;non-White,&#8221; but rather &#8220;non-Anglo.&#8221; The Italians and Spaniards have very little Arabic admixture, despite the supposed &#8220;700 years of Arab occupation,&#8221; which was exclusive to the South of Spain. On that note, the so-called &#8220;Arabs&#8221; who occupied Spain were Berbers, who were in fact a Caucasoid people closer to the ancient Greeks than to modern day Semites.</p>
<p>Your post seems much like a trolls. It&rsquo;s clear that you don&rsquo;t have any serious (or extremely deluded) racial consciousness if you chose to miscegenate with an Indian woman. Unacceptable.</p>

<p>There is no distinct biological definition of &#8220;white&#8221; or any other race. There will always be a grey area between two races. During the 19th century people outside of Northern Europe were known as &#8220;Dark Whites&#8221; (i.e. racially half white and arab). Today we see them as white and rightly so. But there needs to be a definition of what constitutes white. As a person&rsquo;s ancestry moves further and further away from Europe they look more and more like another race, and there&rsquo;s always cases where a Greek person could pass for Lebanese and vice versa. Despite all the research on genetic markers etc., liberals can keep expanding the definition of white using the argument that in previous centuries, even countries which wns believe is white were not classed as such.</p>

<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t even agree with that&hellip; I find that American whites (at least in the Midwest and Northwest where there aren&rsquo;t too many Italians or Poles) strongly resemble the Dutch in appearance, albeit shorter.

    You write a very confused post.Any geneticist worth his salt can immediately lay to rest the canard that southern Italians are a &#8216;mixed group with Arab and others thrown in&rsquo;.If you ever care to actually look at multifactor genetic cluster analysis of typical southern Italian genomes you will find that they correlate closer with other Europeans as an &#8216;in-group&rsquo; - and not with any asiatic or african population.See the works of Cavalli-Sforza and his &#8216;genetic distance coefficients&rsquo; - Italians aren&rsquo;t particular distant from such groups as ethnic French or even English.<br>
 Likewise, modern genetics tells us that typical Spanish genetics haven&rsquo;t been altered much in thousands of years and apparently received little &#8216;Arab&rsquo; gene flow.<br>
 As for Poles and Ukranians being called non-White.Well you say you&rsquo;re &#8216;old enough&rsquo; to remember this, the time of prejudice against Poles was approximately 100 years ago, so i doubt if you&rsquo;re speaking from experience.Anyhow if you take a scientific measure of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; (with a meter measuring skin reflectivity, perhaps the only objective measure of the concept), you will find that Poles would probably score the highest marks, as they would on a measure of the incidence of blond hair and blue eyes (I can only conclude you don&rsquo;t go out much).Martha Stewart, for example, is of Polish extraction - only a mental defective would say she is &#8216;not White&rsquo;.<br>
 &#8216;Race&rsquo; was always a category in the US census.Never were Poles described as &#8216;not White&rsquo; in the US census.So what does this &#8216;considered&rsquo; not White actually mean?</p>

		<p>Online daters are very choosy. They are people who aren&rsquo;t happy or can&rsquo;t find mates in the real world. They come online to date for a specific reason(s). America is a white oriented nation, so the white male and female online daters are going to get the most responses. Interracial dating is driven by biology. Black males get the most female dates because they are the strongest of the male bunch, Asian(and light skin Hispanic) women get the most male dates because they are the most feminine of the female bunch. Asian males and Black females are left out of the interracial dating game because of their biology. Our culture is based on biology.  Both Asian males and black females are not biologically compatible with each other. Males are not suppose to be feminine and females are not suppose to be muscular. </p>
<p>If you are an Asian woman, and you didn&rsquo;t want a non-white male mate in real life, you&rsquo;re not going to want to meet on online for real life contact. If you are a white woman, and you didn&rsquo;t want a non-white male mate, you&rsquo;re not going to want to meet one online to meet in real life.</p>

<p>I agree with you. For some reason many posters on this board seem to beleive that all Black men are 6&rsquo;2 muscle bound adonisi&rsquo;s whereas all White men are weak little specimens. </p>
<p>Like you, I have seen a number of small, dimunitive Black men. In fact, I have a friend who is a medical doctor who says that for the past ten years, statistics are showing that the average teenage Black boy is actually smaller than the average White male. He says that there are a number of reasons for this including the fact that many Blacks have children at younger ages, amny Black women who have children are in their late teens and early 20s and thus have not fully developed and because of this fact, their children tend to be smaller.</p>
<p>In another example, my daugther who is an elementary school teacher mentioned to me that she and her fellow teachers were discussing the fact that so many young Black boys seemed to be considerably smaller than they used to be 15 to 20 years ago, whereas, many White boys actually seemed to be bigger.</p>
<p>It is interesting.    </p>

<p>About three years ago, there was a small march of blacks in north St. Louis City, who were either related to or close friends to a young man that disappeared out of the blue a few years before that.  At the time of his disappearance, he was 18 years old and 5&rsquo;1&#8221; tall.  The five-foot-one jumped right out at me.  It could be a matter of nutrition, but the theory you stated is also a good one.</p>

<p> I checked today, and it had been deleted!  The merciless scissors of censorship fell over me! I didnt think or intended to make a strong statement.<br>

<p>It WASN&rsquo;T a strong statement.  But it was a tabooed statement.  You can say &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221;   &mdash;  -  but not the reverse. </p>

<p>The fact is that more than a few White women date outside of their race, as do many young people for that matter. What you see as &#8220;wishful thinking&#8221; is actually reality.</p>

		<p>What is happening is that many doctors are giving Black women drugs in an effort to prohibit normal growth in their children. This is part of a larger conspiracy to practice genocide on Black men. </p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve been watching too many TV advertisements, I&rsquo;m afraid. They have swallowed the Kool Aid.</p>
<p>In addition to  nutrition, or whatever   &mdash;   dissipation and drugs, so common and casually accepted among blacks, are surely another cause for the many scrawny black men one sees  (in real life, that is, not on TV).   Blacks tend to have unhealthy lifestyles that do not promote physical fitness.  They have poor diets and are often addicted to junk food, greasy fried foods, and alcohol.  Drug use is very common.</p>
<p>That brings to mind  a colored woman I once had working for me.  She was a nice person with a pleasant personality.  She had a sweet and gentle disposition with no meanness in her, but she was alcoholic, I realized, and almost certainly used drugs as well.  The poor thing had a son who was retarded and under-developed since birth. (Should that be any surprise?)  Though a teenager, he was small for his age and required special attention;  he was her main worry.  I recall she had to escort him to school and pick him up after school, or he would be attacked by the other black children.  Very sad.<br>
 <br>
She  was later strangled by her boyfriend, so I heard.   The police found her body stuffed under the bed.  It was in the newspaper.   I have no idea what became of her retarded son.</p>

<p>Do you have any proof for your allegation? Is this what they are currently teaching you at the White Conspiracies Against Blacks Academy Prep? </p>

		<p>For the supposed strongest of the male bunch blacks are currently being run out of boxing, beaten in mma, wrestling, power lifting and world&rsquo;s strongest man.</p>
<p>Also, if they are so strong then why does it always take a large group of them to attack one white on the street?</p>
