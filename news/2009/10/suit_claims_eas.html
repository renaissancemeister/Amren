<h1>Suit Claims East St. Louis Passed Up White Police Chief Over Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas J.C. Pistor, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>City officials seeking a new police chief passed up the former director of the Florida Highway Patrol, who formerly was a top commander of the Illinois State Police, because he is white, two former members of a city board claim.</p>
<p>Wyatt Frazer and Della Murphy allege in a federal lawsuit that they were forced off the Police, Fire and Civil Service Board for their advocacy of a white candidate when the chief&rsquo;s job was open in 2007.</p>
<p>Their lawyer said Tuesday the spurned candidate was Ronald Grimming, a Metro East resident who rose to be deputy superintendent of the State Police before taking the top spot in Florida in 1993. Grimming could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The suit against Mayor Alvin Parks, City Manager Robert Betts and the city itself does not identify Grimming by name or qualifications.</p>
<p>But the plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyer, Thomas E. Kennedy III, said it was Grimming, and that Parks told his clients &#8220;the city wasn&rsquo;t ready to hire a white police chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>East St. Louis has a 97.7 percent black population, according to U.S. census records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The candidate chosen at the time was Michael Baxton Sr., an African-American who had been a police detective in adjoining Centreville and police chief in Brooklyn, a village of fewer than 700 residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit also alleges that Parks and Betts repeatedly questioned Frazer and Murphy after they hired two white applicants for probationary police officer positions. Frazer and Murphy were fired in October 2007, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] defendants thereafter fired all of the candidates hired by [Frazer and Murphy] and hired several new officers and employees based on their racial and political beliefs,&#8221; the suit alleges.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for punishing anti-white discrimination, but let&rsquo;s face it:  A white person that would want to be the Police Chief in East St. Louis has to have an elevator that doesn&rsquo;t quite go all the way to the top.  He&rsquo;d be blamed for all the black crime, i.e. all the crime, in ESL.  He would be a convenient fall guy.  Even beyond that, it&rsquo;s a thankless job.</p>

		<p>Ever been through East St. Louis?  I&rsquo;ve driven (quickly) through Detroit, north Milwaukee, Camden, east Cleveland, Ford Heights (Illinois) but there&rsquo;s no place as awful as East St. Louis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no amount of money that could motivate any sane man to become police chief there.  The city had 80,000 people as recently as the late 1970.  Now, barely 30,000 live in what looks like a place hit by nuclear bombs and plagues.  </p>
<p>You can not imagine what less than 40 years of African &#8220;government&#8221; has done to a once-thriving industrial town.  Ugh!</p>
<p>And lest you foget a recent news story, it is East St. Louis that is creeping toward Belleville (Illinois) where the poor White kid got pummeled on a bus while his African tormentors were cheered and congratulated. </p>

		<p>	Under the guise of protecting racial minorities, laws, programs, and practices discriminate in hiring and promotion, in access to loans for business and housing, in college admission and scholarships, and in numerous other ways that affect livelihoods of Whites. Showing favoritism to any individual simple because of race is not only incongruous, but harmful&hellip; true equality may only be achieved by merit, and intellectual capacity.</p>

		<p>Any White that would want ANY job in a city that&rsquo;s 97% black is NOT one of us. He&rsquo;s got to be a liberal that probably pushed a/a at the expense of Whites everywhere he&rsquo;s been. Anyway, blacks ALWAYS vote for blacks without knowing ANYTHING about their views and, really,there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. I just wish Whites would do the same. There are countless places throughout this country where blacks are elected to powerful positions in predominantly White communities,but you will NEVER see the reverse.</p>

<p>If it were 98 percent white, the DOJ would launch an investigation or racism and the courts would order desegregation.</p>

<p>The three candidates to replace Los Angeles Police Chief Bratton are White (at least as near as I can tell).</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard anything from the loud-mouthed, race-based advocates or their racist organizations yet  &mdash;  La Raza, NAACP (not that the two previous black chiefs of police weren&rsquo;t disasters, Willi Williams and Bernard Parks).</p>

		<p>  It certainly is a puzzlement why Grimming, a former DCI commander and Illinois law enforcement fast tracker, would want to be the Chief of the notoriously corrupt and impoverished ESL PD. It&rsquo;s not like he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d be getting into. He&rsquo;s ridiculously overqualified. I think maybe the whole point is to get the lawsuit rolling. </p>

		<p>Hello QD, my friend from St. Louis. I joined Facebook about three months ago and have been busy with that lately. I have quite a few like minded people on FB and wish you were there too. Maybe I could leave my name at the bottom of an ashtray at the Courtesy Diner near Khwy and Arsenal so you could join my FB list of friends. Anyway, to the subject at hand, ESL is 97% black? How did it ever get that low?</p>

<p>Actually I tell this to a black guy that I work with (who is civilized about race- a rarity, a class guy believe it or not) I tell him that White women who go black. We don&rsquo;t want them back! This case reminds me of the guy who was from South Africa and he was white. He tried to get a minority grant to go to school. He was African-American because he lived in the US but was born in South Africa. They turned him down because he wasn&rsquo;t black. The woman told him he wasn&rsquo;t black. Yet, they slam others for saying &#8220;black&#8221; instead of African American. But why in the hell would this guy want to have a job around all those blacks? Is he suicidal? Good thing he&rsquo;s a cop so he&rsquo;s well armed. </p>

<p>There are a coterie of whites that live in the city limits of ESL, but very near the bluffs.  I know one personally, that&rsquo;s on a street with three other white houses, and only one black.  He tells me that the County Sheriff&rsquo;s office polices his neighborhood instead of the ESL keystones.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ll get that list when I go back to STL next weekend; that diner knows me and my penchant for brain sandwiches.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks&#8221; should have the right to have &#8220;Blacks&#8221; running their &#8220;Black&#8221; cities, including having all &#8220;Black&#8221; police forces. Sorry, but if the few White stragglers don&rsquo;t like it, they should move to a White city - something they should have done anyway. </p>
<p>Its not very complicated at all. Its just common sense. Just as the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; should have the basic and fundamental right of having their cities run by their own kind, so too should White people enjoy that elementary civil right.  </p>

<p>How do we decide which city and job-place is black, and which one is white? Isn&rsquo;t there often some sort of mix. Are there &#8216;white neighborhoods&rsquo;? Sounds to me, saying it&rsquo;s a fundamental right such and such should work there - breaking it down, just mandates some sort affirmative action. That might not be so bad, providing the information class and the ruling class also were obsessed with uncovering and correcting white underrepresentation too. Of course this conflicts with the equally noble goal of making sure citizens are exposed to others unlike themselves, unless they are non-white, because then they benefit from working around mentors similar to themselves. (sarcasm off) </p>

		<p>I agree with previous posters- any white that wants to be police chief of a 97.7% black town is about three gallons shy of a full tank.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of the &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome&#8221;? Well, I&rsquo;ve come up with a new one: The &#8220;Conrack Syndrome&#8221;. Named after that White teacher, Pat Conroy, who taught all those black children on that island off South Carolina; the Conrack Syndrome applies to anyone - especially Caucasians - who believe that they can be successful in getting minorities to do what they want them to do, simply by sheer force of personality.</p>
<p>This wannabe police chief seems to be infected with Conrack Syndrome, but, young Caucasian college graduates who go off to teach in the inner city, or on North American aborigine reservations also are afflicted with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;97% black? And he WANTED the job?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, this is all true. An awful place even back in 1966. My AIT army instructor [black man] said he was from E. St. Louis and said that it was a good place TO BE FROM! Over forty years ago it was bad! </p>
<p>That 97 % figure cannot be correct. I cannot even imagine ANY WHITE PERSON LIVING THERE AND SURVIVING FOR MORE THAN A SHORT PERIOD!</p>
<p>They had a lot of incidents years ago, an maybe even now, where white tourists would get lost on the interstate and stop off in East St. Louis to &#8220;ask for directions&#8221;. You can guess what happened.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Police sent a man and woman undercover team posing as lost tourists and THEY WERE LUCKY TO NOT GET KILLED THEMSELVES. Even when armed!!</p>

		<p>Actually the Illinois State Police have sent troopers down to patrol ESL from time to time when the ESL PD couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t, for any number of reasons. There was a period when cars with white couples were being forced off the highway by blacks and robbed-among other things-at gunpoint. White couples were also being forced out of their cars at traffic control devices and raped/robbed/beaten/murdered.The ISP sent a bunch of troopers and several pairs of male/female troopers to troll for goblins on the highways and in downtown ESL proper. One night a couple of said goblins forced over one of the decoy vehicles, and one of them got a 9mm facial reconstruction from one of the female troopers. Shortly thereafter, the local goblin affinity for that particular M.O. evaporated. But as soon as the troopers departed back to their zones. it was business as usual. </p>
