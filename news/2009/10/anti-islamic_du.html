<h1>Anti-Islamic Dutch Lawmaker Speaking at US College</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Buffalo News, October 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A European lawmaker whose anti-Islamic views once led British officials to ban him from visiting that country will address Temple University students on Tuesday, despite protests from campus organizations.</p>
<p>Dutch politician Geert Wilders has outraged Muslims by comparing their holy book, the Quran, to Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; and for his calls to end Muslim immigration to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Muslim students at Temple, a public university serving about 34,000 students, and their supporters plan to protest the evening event, which was organized by a student group called Purpose and is being funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Muslim population at Temple feels attacked, threatened, and ultimately unsafe that Mr. Wilders has been invited to voice his hate-driven opinions,&#8221; the Muslim Students Association wrote in a letter to university officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Temple officials issued a statement saying the university &#8220;is a community of scholars in which freedom of inquiry and freedom of expression are valued.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect the right of our student organizations to invite people who express a wide variety of views and ideas,&#8221; the school said in a statement.</p>

		<p>There was a protest outside, the usual rabble. Two of them were interviewed, and were quite open with their threats. I wonder if they were prosecuted?</p>

		<p>Free speech&rsquo;s time is very limited.  Our rights are fast disappearing.  The protest is being funded by &#8220;The David Horowitz Freedom Center&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Well that should tell us something.</p>

		<p>If I was still at College and observed the culture of considering the feelings of others above genuine debate, I would feel extremely put off by the whole thing. Kind of like enrolling for a self defense class and having the instructor demure on giving techniques for countering the kicks and blows coming my way&hellip; as physical contact would endanger my &#8220;self esteem&#8221;. Don`t these kids realize they are being cheated on exactly what they are paying for?!? </p>

		<p>The same thing was in the US news last week. The official position being that discussing immigration could lead to violence against immigrants or violence in society, therefore, immigration isn&rsquo;t a proper topic of discussion or when it is talked about the discussion needs to be controlled. Taking their logic to it&rsquo;s conclusion, immigration itself should be stopped, because immigrants move to Western societies and then commit violence. </p>

		<p> Freedom of (officially approved) speech   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s the American Way, isn&rsquo;t it? Hope the university officials take true &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; seriously enough to have some police on hand to keep demonstrators from disrupting Wilders&rsquo; speech, as they have so many others at institutions of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; (Yuk! Yuk!) in this country of late.</p>
<p> Maybe &#8220;Purpose&#8221; should have recruited some burly football players armed with truncheons to keep the leftists at bay. But no, of course they won&rsquo;t have thought of that   &mdash;   or will be afraid to do it for fear of being called &#8220;fascists&#8221; and &#8220;Nazis.&#8221; As long as the left has all the muscle on campuses, conservative speakers will continue to be shouted down and driven out.</p>

		<p>As a graduate student I shared office space with Muslim students. Amongst many conversations with them I told them I was an atheist and believed in Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution. I don&rsquo;t make a big thing out of my belief and respect other beliefs so I don&rsquo;t push it. Really it was quite small as far as admissions go but things got chilly with my Muslim office mates to the point that I was uncomfortable and noticed they weren&rsquo;t talking to me much. I understand that their religion has strong teachings against my beliefs. I&rsquo;ve had similar talks with Christians who oppose these beliefs but I think there is a cultural understanding among Westerners that we agree to disagree. I don&rsquo;t think this applies to Muslims. So I can understand that Muslims feel unsafe but I also feel unsafe by their presence and I and my nationality of people were here first. As Muslims are showing that they can&rsquo;t fit in they&rsquo;ll have to be kept out.</p>

		<p>Wilders has for the last five years HAD TO LIVE INSIDE OF A PRISON! That is the only place the Dutch security forces feel confident they can protect him. And that degree of protection will have to be in place as long as the man is alive? He is not that old either, so that could be for many decades? And his party, if the election was held today, might very well win the election in Holland have the most seats in their parliament? What then?</p>

		<p>This will no doubt end up like Taylor&rsquo;s time in Halifax: Wilders will get kicked out by those students who are too brainwashed and naive to hear out and realize the unpleasant truth about Islam.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dutch politician Geert Wilders has outraged Muslims &hellip; for his calls to end Muslim immigration to the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>So if white Americans decided to migrate to, say, Belize, en masse, overwhelming the people there, and one of them called for an end to the uncontrolled influx, would we be &#8220;outraged&#8221;?</p>
<p>I think not.  So what is it about Muslims that gets them so easily outraged?</p>

<p>NOT if they were black and or muslim, no professional White worker would throw away their career by making arrests of the sacred ones. Remember, mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims or blacks.</p>

		<p>I agree with Shawn (the female).  This country is in sad shape.  Things started getting bad (translation, left-leaning) after WWII and picked up speed phenomenally after 1964. </p>
<p> &ldquo;&rsquo;The Muslim population at Temple feels attacked, threatened, and ultimately unsafe that Mr. Wilders has been invited to voice his hate-driven opinions,&rsquo; the Muslim Students Association wrote in a letter to university officials.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Muslims know all about hate-driven opinions, don&rsquo;t they?  Wouldn&rsquo;t they qualify as experts in that area?</p>

		<p>To Awakened:</p>
<p>Re your post (#2), I think you are misinterpreting things, a little. You might reread the sentence that begins &#8220;Muslim students at Temple&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; appearance to speak, is being sponsored by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the student group Purpose. The Center is NOT sponsoring the Muslim protest.</p>
<p>Horowitz was a one-time radical in the Saul Alinsky mode. But, somewhere down the road, he had an epiphany.  </p>

A lot of them did.  Now, they&rsquo;re running the other side of the game.  </p>
<p>Forgive me, but i&rsquo;m a bit suspicious.  And ditto for Mr. Wilders.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same here in the UK. I just watched the bear-baiting Question Time show featuring BNP leader Nick Griffin (which hopefully will prove to be a seminal event in UK television political history). On the panel alongside Griffin were a Black American female, A Muslim female politician and the usual two spineless jellyfish white lefty politicians and moderated by old lefty presenter David Dimbleby. Only an exceptional man like Nick Griffin could have fared so well facing such a hostile panel &amp; audience in an atmosphere that was most definitely anti-BNP. I had refused to watch this particular show for about 10 years because of its constant liberal/Marxist bias but wasn&rsquo;t really surprised to see the young age (only one person over 40 from hundreds seemed to be present) of the brainwashed almost completely liberal-left multicultural hand-picked audience who were completely biased and hissed, booed, and giggled and talked their sanctimonious holier-than-thou Marxist waffle as these big brave liberals demonised Nick Griffin. Was it George Orwell who said that in a totalitarian state the young would be the biggest bigots or words to that effect. It seems like our neo-Marxist masters in the UK are literally terrified of the BNP, (they should be as their truth will destroy the lies of the neo-Marxist Lib/Lab/Con parties) as the media coverage in the days leading up to the show was something like a cross between Pravda &amp; Julius Streicher, with gangs of Red Totalitarian &#8221;anti-fascists&#8221; (there&rsquo;s a laugh) gathered outside the BBC studios to demonstrate and protest against Nick Griffin&rsquo;s inclusion in the show. As usual Red Totalitarians are all for free speech - only if you agree with their point of view. I wouldn&rsquo;t swap one Nick Griffin for a thousand of these spineless creeps.</p>
