<h1>All-Male College Cracks Down on Cross-Dressing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lateef Mungin, CNN, October 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An all-male college in Atlanta, Georgia, has banned the wearing of women&rsquo;s clothes, makeup, high heels and purses as part of a new crackdown on what the institution calls inappropriate attire.</p>
<p>No dress-wearing is part of a larger dress code launched this week that Morehouse College is calling its &#8220;Appropriate Attire Policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policy also bans wearing hats in buildings, pajamas in public, do-rags, sagging pants, sunglasses in class and walking barefoot on campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dress-wearing ban is aimed at a small part of the private college&rsquo;s 2,700-member student body, said Dr. William Bynum, vice president for Student Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress a way we do not expect in Morehouse men,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those breaking the policy will not be allowed to go to class unless they change. Chronic dress-code offenders could be suspended from the college.</p>
<p>Bynum said the policy comes from the vision of the college&rsquo;s president, who wants the institution to create leaders like notable graduates Martin Luther King Jr., actor Samuel Jackson and film director Spike Lee.</p>
<p>Senior Cameron Titus applauds the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The policy is just saying that you have to show more respect in how you dress and there are things that are just not acceptable at Morehouse,&#8221; Titus said. &#8220;We have a legacy that we are trying to uphold.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Yep.  Blacks expect the rest of the world to &#8216;tolerate&rsquo; extremely serious black behavior (murder, rape, robbery, assault&hellip;), but themselves are grossly intolerant of relatively trivial matters.  It&rsquo;s like they expect to be exempted from expectations of tolerance.</p>
<p>The extreme tolerance that they enjoy and take for granted is something they have no intention of showing to others.</p>
<p>A white college could lose government funds over a thing like this.  I bet Morehouse won&rsquo;t, though.</p>

		<p>&#8220;sunglasses in class&#8221;  There was a guy who wore sunglasses inside the training center during an Applebee`s boot camp for new employees. I knew right away that he didn`t have the right attitude, even for just making the correct  impression. One of the instructors who liked me confided  his suspicion that the guy would be gone on the first day it was mandated to arrive promptly at 6:15am. A procedure that had been established  just to see who cared enough to show management how badly they wanted a good paying bar job&hellip;</p>

		<p>Still maintaining the anti-male bias of fashion freedom that females have now enjoyed for over 50 years. Females have been transvestites or cross-dressers on campuses since about 1960 A.D.; isn&rsquo;t it about time for gender equality ? Males still &#8221; hit the fashion glass ceiling &#8221; when it comes to fashion freedom; even within the traditional &#8221; male &#8221; clothing. E.G. Females can wear any style of pants/tights and of any material without her mental state or gender preference being question or ridiculed unlike a male. &#8221; What a double standard &#8221; within menswear without throwing into this mix, the wearing of traditional female wear.</p>

<p>While this is true, anyone who grew up in Los Angeles or lives there now can tell you there is much, much higher percentage of males in the black and hispanic &#8216;communities&rsquo; who dress as women, are homosexual, are transvestite prostitutes and a much higher percentage of men from the same groups who while appearing straight will pay for, well, services from the cross-dressers. </p>

<p>Are you serious? There are MANY more White gay men than there are Black and Hispanic gay men. I am one of them.</p>
<p>In fact, there are far more White married &#8220;family&#8221; men who have secret lives as gay men. I have slept with more than a few of them. I did not know that most of them were married. You should also check out former New Jersey governor Jim Mc Greevey&rsquo;s book The Confession where he talks about the countless number of married gay men (most of them White)who he had sex with in rest stops, their homes, hotels etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Larry Craig, Bob Allen and Jim Kolbe are more common than you think. </p>

		<p>White and Gay:</p>
<p>Sadly, I have to agree with you on this one. It seems like everytime I pick up the newspaper I see some White man (often times married)being busted for trying to solicit undercover sex or engaging in sexual activity in public places.</p>
<p>In the town I live in we had a huge sex scandal two years aog. More than 40 men were busted for unlawful sexual activity in public parks. All but two were White. One was Hispanic and the other was Black. More recently, we had a scandal at our local university where the college president and several other senior level officals resigned their posts after being caught engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior in certain areas of the college campus. It demoralized this mostly conservative commmunity. </p>

<p>You are dead wrong on this one. There are far more White transvsestites and White men who dress as women and have undercover affairs with men and are secret about their sexuality than White or Hispanic men. There are certainly men of those two groups that do so, but the number of White men who engage in such behavior is MUCH higher.</p>

		<p>Wrong Peter. The percentages of gay males in the minority communities are much higher. That&rsquo;s what the poster wrote about.  </p>
<p>I also grew up in and still live and work in Los Angeles. The higher number of Latino and Black homosexuals and transvestism among these groups is something that is very noticeable. In point of fact, high numbers of &#8220;straight&#8221; Black men are extremely attracted to transvestites. Look at the number of Black celebrities and athletes caught in compromising situations with transvestites; Eddie Murphy, former Oakland A&rsquo; pitcher Dave Stewart, singer Harold Melvin, the list is seemingly endless. I work in Hollywood, and see men of all kinds trolling for the tranny prostitutes (I work very close to where Eddie Murphy was arrested) and most of them are Black and Latino males doing the cruising, while none of the transvestites are Whites. </p>
<p>I would think that because of population numbers there could be more White transvestites and homosexuals as far as raw numbers go, but in percentage terms, Blacks and Latinos have a far higher chunks of their populations &#8220;afflicted&#8221;. Black males are known for swinging both ways, keeping it on the &#8220;down low&#8221; and Latino males are known for similar behavior, especially gang-bangers, despite all the machismo trappings in their culture. </p>
<p>Anyway, anyone in L.A. knows this stuff to be true. They might not talk about it, but it&rsquo;s something you notice while growing up here. West Hollywood &#8220;boys town&#8221; is flooded with white homosexuals, but they flock there from all over the country. It&rsquo;s almost as if white gays want to claim &#8220;We&rsquo;re Number 1&#8221;. Maybe they are in raw numbers, but that&rsquo;s about it. People can remark on &#8220;secretly gay&#8221; married White men but with the high numbers of openly gay Blacks and Latinos and the constant flood of &#8216;straight&rsquo; members of these communities turning up in embarrassing &#8220;gay type&#8221; situations, there&rsquo;s little doubt that the percentages in the Black and Latino camps are higher. We could get into gays also inflating their numbers (like the ridiculous claim that they were 10% of the population that ran for decades, since proven a lie), and making up other stories to bolster their numbers, but that&rsquo;s for another thread. Those stories rival the lies told about the threat of heterosexual AIDS for over two decades. </p>

		<p>Hollywood is Hollyweird:</p>
<p>Peter is correct. If you want to talk about Hollywood celebrities, we can go back to White ones such as Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, Clark Gable, Rock Hudson, Raymond Burr, Dack Rambo, Lance Bass, Neal Partick Harris and more current ones (at least 25% of congressional staffers) etc&hellip; Hollywood has covered up the sex lives of numerous movie stars for decades.</p>
<p>Bruce Bower author Of a Place at The Table and a former employee of the late Jerry Falwell but later resinged and decided to expose himself wrote a riveting account of his secret life as a gay man in the conservative movement and discussed the countless number of closeted gay conservative White men in the relgious right movement and many of them were married. </p>
<p>Likewise, David Brock made this exact same claim in his book Blinded By The Right. He said that there were numerous places in Washington D.C. where gay men (overwhelmingly White, many married) met to have sexual liasons with one another. There was even a major rumor that there were so many gay men in the Reagan administration that there was a fund established for male prostitution. </p>
<p>There is a recent documentary entitled Outrage that looks at the number of married White suburban men who are living a double life. I myself am one of them. I have had a number of sexual encounters with men. I have tried to fight it, but I have been unable to do so. I do not dare come out ot my wife, children or family.</p>
<p>Once again, Peter is correct.</p>

		<p>All the haters of white males can do is bring up areas that are mostly white and claim that most homosexuals are white. They completely skirt (no pun intended) the point that several posters have tried to make: the percentage of cross-dressers, homosexuals, bisexuals and other, eh, people who exhibit certain aberrations, is higher among blacks and browns. Which it is. This has been known for decades and if you really want to hear the truth, check arrest records based on population percentages. Or you can simply ask them. The mexicans where I work have no problem commenting on it at all. They look down on the maricones (homosexuals) and will say the relatively high number of latino homosexuals in comparison to whites is an embarrassment.  The bitterness of some of the posters avoiding this side issue or trying to defend their pride is palpable. This is as strange as men who derive gratification from dressing as women or from engaging in sexual activity with other men. Bizarre. </p>
<p>As far as pointing out closeted stars or as some were and are, straight men who engaged in homosexual activity to make it in Hollywood, that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything but the long believed and generally true conception among most in the know that many of the studio heads and most casting directors through the years have been and are homosexuals, as are a high number of managers, not so much agents. But Hollywood, the industry, is not representative of the population as a whole. It&rsquo;s merely a business that attracts a high number of homosexuals, just like Broadway or hair styling. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that one of the favorite tactics of the &#8220;gay community&#8221; has simply been insinuation that someone or some organization is comprised of homosexuals, generally applying this tactic to individuals or groups that gays in general detest. Having worked in Hollywood for years, I&rsquo;ve seen this happen a lot. Or they&rsquo;ll attack someone who finds homosexual activity detestable as being gay themselves, a &#8220;closet case&#8221;. I guess this is because deep down, buried under all the rationalizations, accusations, claims of normalcy, many gays realize they are not truly normal when it comes to their sexual &#8216;orientation&rsquo; as they like to put it. While some or even many may be born homosexual due to a genetic &#8216;condition&rsquo;, that doesn&rsquo;t make the condition normal. It&rsquo;s an aberration, like having six fingers or being a pedophile. Humans are equipped to for heterosexual mating and procreation. That&rsquo;s really the end of the argument, no matter what spine twisting contortions people will go into to claim otherwise.</p>
<p>While the arguments fly back and forth, it&rsquo;s interesting that things are so bad at a college when it comes to cross-dressing that the school has to crack down on it. An historically black school.  </p>

<p>The fact is that more Blacks and Hispanics use crack and blow than Whites? However, according to the organization Commonsense For Drug Policies and Sentencing, Whites, (especally Whites under 45) are five times more likely to use drugs than Blacks or Hispanics.   </p>
<p>My point is that while there may be as many or perhpas more non-White men who cross dress and engage in sexual activity with transvestites, statistics still demonstrate that same sex acitivity is still higher among White males than it is for other ethnic groups.  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Organization Commonsense For Drug Policies and Sentencing&#8221; has already been shown to more than casual when it comes to manipulation of statistics. NO study has actually shown whites more likely to use drugs than blacks or hispanics, especially when it comes to street drugs, hard core narcotics. Go ahead and do some internet homework on this fine organization&rsquo;s work and motives. Among other things, they try to make it seem as if drug related murders committed by blacks and hispanics are somehow on the same level as some white kid (or any kid for that matter) smoking one blunt. </p>
<p>Statistics show that percentage wise there are more same-sex &#8216;activities&rsquo; going on between brown and black men than among whites. There might be more whites in total numbers, but the percentages are lower. All of this dancing around the truth reminds me of those who would screech that there were more whites on welfare than blacks or hispanics while ignoring the fact that the percentage of whites on welfare was far lower than for blacks and hispanics. These days they can no longer do that because blacks and hispanics now top whites in both numbers and percentage, just as they will do (if they haven&rsquo;t already) in terms of raw numbers of gays, cross-dressers, and so on. These poor beleaguered groups already have whites beaten hands down when it comes to rape, gang rape, spousal abuse, and pedophile activity although you&rsquo;d never know it from the MSM. The high number of black and hispanic men who target underage girls is staggering, while the media concentrates on white (and the occasional Asian) internet predators who can&rsquo;t match the minorities in sheer numbers. </p>
<p>Ask someone who&rsquo;s actually been in prison what goes on. The hysterical male-rape stories run here at Amren and other sites are for the most part exaggerated is all I will say. Whites engage in the least homosexual activity, blacks the most with hispanics in the middle. While you&rsquo;ll find queens of all colors, the blacks and browns not only have high numbers, but the highest percentage of queens and highest percentage of men who will take up with them. I suppose it&rsquo;s more acceptable in those cultures on average because they have more of a tendency toward that bent in the first place. </p>

		<p>Put your pants on. If you read the book Brando Unzipped, Marlon Brando was engaging in sexual activity with men long after he became a major bonified star. Same can be said for Rock Hudson and others. </p>
<p>The majority of these men were not engaging in homosexual activity to &#8220;make it in Hollywood&#8221; to use your quote. They willingly participated in such activity. By your logic, than maybe come of the Black and Brown actors you mentioned were having sex with men to &#8220;make it&#8221; in Hollywood. I doubt it. </p>

<p>If a group like &#8220;Organization For Drug Policies and Sentencing&#8221; is so casual and innaccurate then why do conservative publications like The Weekly Standard and The National Review run their ads in their magazines?</p>
<p>Secondly, in regards to child abuse and pedophilia, the group &#8220;Organization Against Missing and Exploited Children&#8221; has documented extensive evidence that the average pedophile is a 44 year old White male and his victim is a young girl between 6 and 10 years old. In fact, Frontline recently did a documentary entitled Teenage prostitution in the suburbs that looked at the staggering number of middle and upper class suburban young White girls being sexually exploited by White businessmen, attorneys, bankers, etc&hellip; It was truly eye opening. </p>
<p>In regards to spousal abuse, White males (of all economic classes) are far more inclined to phyiscal assault their wives.  Pauline Bart in her book Violence Against Women The Bloody Footprints has provided an exhaustive, harrowing account of the ample amount of violence perpetrated by White men (and men of other races) toward women. Nonetheless, the violence, abuse and exploitation of women by White males is considerably higher than other races, especially in regards to spousal abuse and pedophile activity.</p>
<p>As far a I am concerned any man or person who engages in such horrendous activities should be in prison for life, yet all concrete data shows that White men committ such crimes in higher numbers.    </p>

<p>The Meekly Standard (deliberate misspelling) and the National Review are neo-con, not conservative or racialist publications.  (NR used to be much better in the past).  They believe in fantasies like racial equality just as enthusiastically as any leftist.  Therefore, they can just as easily believe that organization just as much as the ACLU.</p>
<p>There is actually an epidemic of black gangs from big cities like NYC, Detroit and Chicago going to places in the Upper Midwest and kidnapping teenage (and younger) white girls and women of Scandinavian extraction and forcing them to be prostitutes for mainly black johns in the inner cities.  I happened to strike up a conversation with a Federal prison guard who was part of a team who was transporting such a convicted interstate kidnapper/pimp from the Greenville, IL Federal prison to St. Louis University Hospital for some advanced medical test, and he told me that, in a round about way.  The black was from Chicago, and went into Wisconsin at least three times to kidnap girls, take them back to the south side of Chi, and he also served as their pimp.</p>

<p>While I do not doubt much of what you said, I should inform you about a sex scandal we had here in Indiana a few yers ago. It involved more than 50 White men from varied professions - police officers, attorneys, physicians, businessmen etc&hellip; involved in sexual activity with Black females. Some of these women were as young as 14 years old.  </p>
<p>The local and state media described much of the detail in graphic terms. It was disgraceful in how some of these men sexually exploited these women. Exploitation of women cuts across racial lines.</p>

		<p>Kevin should do some research. The Organization For Drug Policies and Sentencing is a scam, and as noted by Question Diversity, is supported by &#8216;neo-con&rsquo; pubs and organizations, which are really Marxist organizations, in league with their cohorts supposedly on the other side. </p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of pedophiles, an interesting fact is that the homosexual lobby has worked overtime to hide the fact that homosexuals are the majority of pedophiles. When the Orange County Register made the move to be the first newspaper in the country to report this fact, the gay lobby went crazy. To this day, they work 24/7 to hide this, deride this fact, having &#8220;experts&#8221; juggle statistics to show otherwise. Yet the fact is that most pedophiles are homosexual predators, not heterosexual in nature. Like others have pointed out, in raw numbers, you probably have more white pedophiles, hetero or homosexual, but in percentages, blacks, the latino community (and Filipinos!) have higher per numbers. In fact, latinos don&rsquo;t see much wrong with it per se. Look up &#8220;rapto&#8221;. </p>
<p>Pauline Bart&rsquo;s &#8220;work&#8221; has already been shown to be leftist claptrap, as it has easily been shown that white males &#8220;of all economic classes&#8221; are less likely to physically assault women than non-whites. &#8220;Concrete data&#8221; from our own anti-white government (and major city Police Depts) shows blacks and latinos are the most likely to physically assault and abuse women, even Koreans are more likely than white males to indulge in this. Ms. Bart (look her up - you&rsquo;ll have a million laughs) is just another of the &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; from the left out there accusing white males of all the ills in the world. </p>
<p>Whites do have their percentage of the population with all kinds of problems, crime, etc. It&rsquo;s just that this percentage of the population is smaller than what you&rsquo;ll find in the black and hispanic populations. Stating these types of truths drives the liberals and their agents crazy. </p>

		<p>Black males are more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than any other group according to research, see below. It seems among themselves gays admit this, but to the public at large, at least the white public, the propaganda has to have a certain tilt. This just proves that gays are another group being used as tools, just like blacks and other special interest factions that can be pitted against the general white population. </p>

		<p>Kevin, Mark, Guard Your Kids:</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this drug sentencing organization you all mention that same one that likes to release asinine reports every once in awhile complaining about how blacks are such-and-such times more likely than whites to go to prison for a &#8220;drug crime?&#8221;  What they conveniently leave out of their report is that dealing crack for the 8th time is just as much of a &#8220;drug crime&#8221; as possessing weed for the first time.  It&rsquo;s just that blacks tend to the more serious end of &#8220;drug crimes.&#8221;  What they also don&rsquo;t tell you is that blacks tend to live in black-heavy criminal jurisdictions, where there is more lenient sentencing.  </p>

		<p>The fact is that I am White physician who lives in the southeastern part of the nation. I treat AIDS patients and those with other sexually transmitted diseases. I have been practicing for 23 years. I can tell firsthand that the group that engages in the most same sex relationships are White males. What is even more disturbing as some of these posters have mentioned, many of them either have significant others or are married.</p>

<p>Just because a person is a liberal does not mean that everything they say is incorrect anymore than anyone who is a conservative is always correct. </p>

		<p>Can get back to the point of the article and that was cross dressing on college campuses?</p>
<p>All I have to say is that I attended a small, liberal arts college in New England from 1993-1997. The overwhelming majority of cross dressers were White guys. This was the honest truth.</p>
<p>I rarely saw any non-White guy dressed in womens attire.</p>
