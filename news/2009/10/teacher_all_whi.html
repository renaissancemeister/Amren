			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Dyke, Independent (London), October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A BOMBSHELL new television show will tonight claim that all white people are racist.</p>
<p>An American schoolteacher and anti-race campaigner will conduct an experiment for Channel 4 to prove how prejudiced Britain is.</p>
<p>Jane Elliott, 76, whose nickname is The Bitch, travelled to the UK for the test.</p>
<p>Part of the show features former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made up as a black person and US President Barack Obama as a Chinese.</p>
<p>Elliott is given a group of 30 volunteers, of mixed age and race, and splits them into two teams based on their eye colour.</p>
<p>Those with brown eyes are treated well, but those with blue eyes are ridiculed, humiliated and insulted.</p>
<p>Her aim is to create a mock &#8220;apartheid regime&#8221; to make the blue eyed people experience prejudice, discrimination and racism.</p>
<p>However at the end of the experiment, set in an old warehouse and lasting several hours, the white and black volunteers end up in a bitter row.</p>
<p>Some even walk out. Many of the white volunteers claim that black people do not have the monopoly on discrimination.</p>
<p>A middle aged white woman says: &#8220;They think racism is just for black people. I&rsquo;ve had comments made about me because I&rsquo;m blonde and white.&#8221;</p>
<p>However one dad, who is black, reveals how he never picks his daughter up from school because her mum is white and he doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know she is mixed race in case she is taunted.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment, Elliott claims the white volunteers have shown their true colours.</p>
<p>She tells the C4 documentary tonight at 10pm: &#8220;White people should feel guilty about their behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t do things because you&rsquo;re white, you do things because you&rsquo;re ignorant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are conditioned to the method of white superiority from the moment of birth.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Without knowing anything about Ms. Elliot  &mdash;  I probably agree with some of her observations.  Whites are &#8220;racist&#8221; from birth; &#8220;racist&#8221; in the broad, modern use of the term, which means having some preference for one&rsquo;s own race. </p>
<p>What &#8220;The Bitch&#8221; likely omits from her presentation is that other races also possess that same in group preference she ascribes only to whites.  Thus, by opening our borders to other races  &mdash;  and fostering an atmosphere where whites are shamed and maligned for expressing any racial solidarity whatsoever  &mdash;  we are exposing ourselves to those same consequences that Ms. Elliot asserts non-whites are the victims of.</p>
<p>With that in mind  &mdash;  rather than trying to fix an unworkable living arrangement that can only deteriorate further, shouldn&rsquo;t we be examining ways for the races to peacefully separate rather than futily trying to alter unavoidable proclivities of human nature?  </p>

<p>I think this woman is truly pathetic, a racial apostate.  And what&rsquo;s really sad is that she is the apotheosis of this kind of neurotic thinking held by a whole lot of foolish people.</p>
<p>She then goes on to pontificate that, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do things because you&rsquo;re white, you do things because you&rsquo;re ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on that point I wholly disagree.  </p>
<p>I think that the reason most white people who are averse to mingling with many non whites, particularly blacks, is is that they are just the opposite of being ignorant; they are informed.  And they base that information gleaned from everyday, real life encounters with blacks and other non whites. </p>
<p>They recognize readily, if not immediately, that there are often very real innate and irreconcilable differences between the races.</p>

		<p>Years ago I saw Jane Elliot blubbering on the Oprah show. She was in tears because she was upset about the fact that every time she turned on the news she saw footage of blacks being arrested by the police.</p>
<p>She told Oprah she was worried that people might get the wrong idea that blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crime.</p>

		<p>Sounds fascinating and predictable at the same time. <br>
I have heard of these seminars being used in a business setting here in the states. The only result is to keep whites from expressing their true feelings in fear of being labled &#8216;racist&rsquo;. </p>
<p>At my current work we were made to view an online training course about diversity. It was hilariously ineffective featuring discrimination between elephants and giraffes!!! Like our staff is in second grade. </p>

<p>Well one (a rational white person) would hope that that would be a proposition accepted as a normal and expected behavior of the White race or any other race that could demonstrate a factual basis of superiority (either generalized or specialized). Unfortunately contemporary evidence abounds that pathological and crippling guilt complexes are really more the order of the day when analyzing attitudes and behavior patterns of Whites in a racial context.</p>

		<p>At least we can all guess at how she got her nickname.</p>
<p>I agree that white people feel superior but I think that other races feel just as superior but for different reasons. I have known people of many different backgrounds and they all feel as if their race and culture has certain advantages. </p>
<p>This lady doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that even if you do away with race humans will form themselves into groups that will feel superior to other groups. It already happens with religious groups. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how race got to be such a problem in the first place. History tells us that most of the wars ever fought were fought among our own kind. There is no real history of race wars and there probably wouldn&rsquo;t be in the future if idiots would leave people alone and let them segregate. </p>

		<p>Jane Elliott, white woman, must be a racist, since she says all white people are racists.  So she thinks she is a racist.  I, who do not hold her view, do not admit to being a racist.  She does.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that you say?  She is an exception?  How convenient.  So she gets to decide who is an exception and who isn&rsquo;t, never mind whether or not she has ever met those whom she calls racist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s logically incohesive, and she can thus be dismissed without further ado.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say that this woman is unhinged (she&rsquo;s claimed elsewhere that the paper and the English language are the inventions of blacks) but what&rsquo;s far more sinister is the cultural regime in the US and now, apparently, in the UK, which has allowed her to make a fortune hawking the same tired absurdities. Who really expects such a person to check her opinions for internal consistency, or to examine actual facts? How on earth has she escaped brainwashing so many children with nary a peep from the childrens&rsquo; parents, or from responsible authorities? That&rsquo;s the far more troubling question.</p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;We are conditioned to the method of white superiority from the moment of birth.&rdquo; &mdash; Jane Elliot.</em></p>
<p>This woman made her reputation peddling anti-white propaganda and it has obviously been an extremely lucrative and rewarding career for somebody of such modest and mediocre intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>I can understand such business-oriented opportunisims. What I cannot understand is why somebody would persist in peddling the same fallacious lies and inexactitudes over such an extended period of time; unless they are energised and motivated by a particular antagonism that perhaps finds it&rsquo;s best expression in the ISD-10 or DSM-IV-TR(2004) manuals of dysfunctional psychology.</p>
<p>She is really pushing the boat out on 5th column treason and dissent in a manner that her feminazi co-conspirators could only find wholly inspiring.</p>

		<p>I watched this drivel.  A Black women whinged about Black boys being 8 times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police. No one pulled her up on it and said that&rsquo;s because they are more likely to be carrying weapons or drugs.  And a mixed race man said he refused to meet his daughter from school, because he was afraid she would be taunted if the the other kids and parents saw what colour he was.  No one pulled him up on the fact that he was prejudiced, assuming that all the kids and parents were racists.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t watch either Jane Elliot or television. I&rsquo;ve known who she was for a long time, and I think she&rsquo;s little more than a PC attention hound whose sick act jumped the shark a long time ago.</p>
<p>Never pay attention to people like this, and above all, never cooperate with them. That people supposedly possessed of good sense listen to her simply shows how uncommon common sense is. It also shows how morally and intellectually bankrupt television is.</p>

		<p>Years and years ago I saw a TV show about this vile woman.  She separated third graders by eye color and told the blue-eyed kids that they were inferior, lazy and stupid.  She encouraged the brown-eyed kids to taunt and humiliate the blue-eyed kids.  Then the next day she reversed it.  I&rsquo;ll never forget the clips of little children crying their hearts out over the cruel treatment and name-calling they endured.  The woman is despicable.  She hates her own race. </p>

When she says all whites are racists, is she including herself? Or is she, and a selected other few, exempt?</p>
<p>I suspect that she harbors great racial animosity which is why she projects this on everyone else. To escape scrutiny and take the attention of her own feelings, she accuses everyone what she believes.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do things because you&rsquo;re white, you do things because you&rsquo;re ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my life experiences I&rsquo;ve had an African American step father and step siblings (a drum I&rsquo;ve beaten to death on this forum in the past) and I&rsquo;ve literally been the only White guy working amongst teams of Polynesians, Sudanese blacks, Southern Asians (numerous times), Vietnamese (hard workers) and Muslim Arabs to name just a few (along with working with various other &#8216;mixed groups.&rsquo;)<br>
So ignorance of other ethnic and/or racial groups is not my excuse.<br>
In fact I&rsquo;d like become more ignorant of other cultures and to &#8216;unlearn&rsquo; what I do know about them already.</p>
<p>When I went to school in NZ, they&rsquo;d ram the dying Maori language (spoken by 45k people on earth roughly), various cultural practices and their belief system which was really just &#8216;myths and legends&rsquo; down our throats.<br>
All this was done to promote mutual respect from us understanding their culture further.<br>
But when I learned that this group thinks that half the of country that we were currently standing on was thought to be a whale carcass that was pulled out of the sea by some big gigantic Maori warrior who became a god (one of many). <br>
Whether it was symbolic or not, it didn&rsquo;t do much towards me  respecting them as a people and frankly all I wanted was, all of that useless, incorrect information out of my head.  </p>
<p>On the blue eyed and brown eyed kids getting separated experiment or lesson?<br>
They did this to me when I was at primary school, it wasn&rsquo;t as drawn out as described above. <br>
Our teacher had us all stand, then she had the brown eyed kids sit down and the blue eyed kids remain standing.<br>
Even back then in the 70&rsquo;s we were in the minority (though this was is a heavy white majority town), then the teacher started asking us various questions along the lines of &#8220;how would you like it if&hellip;&#8221;,  playing on the fact that we were feeling awkward and self conscious standing up with everyone staring at us.</p>
<p>It had the reverse to the desired affect on myself, as I looked around at the other kids who were standing and even though I was under 10 yrs old, I remember identifying that the other kids who were standing were the smartest and the better looking kids in the room. <br>
So maybe it was the awakening of my racial pride. <br>
So thank you meddling, Marxist White liberals you helped bring me here. <br>
Kudos to you.</p>

<p>Most of White America spends far too much time in front of the IDIOT BOX, when had they used that time in their local communities, we could be making a dramatic change for the better, both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>So, throw the idiot box out, or at least, turn the damned thing off. Then get out and volunteer for political campaigns, at your local library, Fire and Rescue teams, or even stand for election to some local post. Kick the megalomaniacs out of office and get real citizen representation back in our government.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that she has been able to push her program for so long without being challenged. She&rsquo;s never asked to defend herself in debate. What little writing she has is never peer reviewed. Over the years as conditions change she&rsquo;s never asked to justify any updates in her methods. There doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a competitive market where she has to defend her methods and costs against competitors. I&rsquo;d ask her what she thinks about religious discrimination against abortion, gays and women priests. I&rsquo;d want to put her in international context such as what she thinks about the Palestinian problem, how she would fight the Taliban, or what to do about illegal immigration. My hunch is that she is anti-white and only anti-white.</p>
<p>We know from brain science that intense, humiliating, bullying experiences can change the brain physically. That&rsquo;s what her program can do. Are businesses allowed to change the brains of employees or schools allowed to affect the brains of students? There&rsquo;s got to be a legal issue there.</p>
<p>For whites who want to put an end to her ugly program as well as end all these diversity brainwashing programs, I think a good thing to do is support white organizations like AmRen. There are other organizations in the links section here. If millions of whites supported these organizations and leaders, resources and talent would become available to do the job. </p>

Exactly!  I didn&rsquo;t become pro-white or &#8220;racist&#8221; in the modern sense until I started having all the anti-white, multicultural stuff rammed down my throat.  That, and after Trent Lott&rsquo;s debacle 2002, I had the misfortune of reading my first article by that slimeball Tim Wise, then I luckily came across articles by Jared Taylor and read &#8220;Death of the West&#8221; by Pat Buchannan.  </p>
<p>My point is, by trying to make whites &#8220;unracist&#8221; (again, my modern definitions), they are making whites like me, who had no contact with non-whites, who were not biased against non-whites, to further the cause of American Renaissance and other pro-white movements.  Much in the same way Malcolm X didn&rsquo;t hate whites until some black lowlife in prison convinced him that all of his troubles were because of &#8220;the white man&#8221;.</p>

<p>We live within driving distance (a SAFE 1 hour or so) of these places and she&rsquo;ll win a voucher of sorts if she writes an honest, factual account of her 30 or 31 days.</p>
<p>If she does not make it through the month I&rsquo;ll win.  Of course I&rsquo;ll win regardless because I&rsquo;m not dumb enough to live in one of these slums where &#8220;her&#8221; people live.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, where DOES this clueless woman live?  Five&rsquo;ll get you ten that it&rsquo;s in an area with very few - if any -Africans.    </p>

Yes!  That&rsquo;s soooooo true.  Every single waking moment out of my 31 years on this planet, whether it be during bathtime or going out on a date or doing homework or eating supper or doing my chores around the house, my parents ALWAYS talked about non-whites and ALWAYS how white people are the best.  Not a single second out of my 31 years have I EVER thought about anything other than being white and oppressing black people.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a divide between whites and blacks, because whites judge blacks by their character and not by the color of their skin.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics treat everyone outside their race as outsiders.</p>
<p>Anybody like this poor fool has to spend 24/7 trying different tricks to keep the races from killing each other with some kind of incessant racial propaganda scheme.  How much easier it would be on her if she accepted the real world for what it is and not what she wants it to be because of her obvious mental illness.</p>

		<p> &#8220;&hellip;has anybody among all you AmRenners out there ever seen whites ridiculing, harassing, and laughing at blacks, either as a group or individually?&#8221;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>No.  What I have seen is whites - both individually and as organizations   &mdash;   bending over backwards trying to be extra nice and accommodating to them in every possible way. Extra nice in ways that they would not have been to just another white person.<br>
We&rsquo;ve all seen it.  We all know it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And what do we get for it?  Anger!  Accusations! Demands!  No matter all the grovelling and penance that we do to atone for the crime of being white, blacks  (and race-traitors like this dizzy Jane Elliott) complain even more bitterly about institutional racism and tell us that we&rsquo;re all racists &hellip; <i>&#8220;from the moment of birth.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to tell them all to get lost and don&rsquo;t bother us anymore with this nonsense.</p>

		<p>Jane Elliott figured out a long time ago that her ticket to a comfortable life, meaning $$$$ without having to work hard, was to start grandstanding against her own people. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. That&rsquo;s how you get published today as well. Just b8&%# and moan about how horrible pre-1965 America was, how horrible whites are, and you&rsquo;ll get some attention from the people that run the publishing houses.</p>
<p>All whites are born racist. So are all blacks, asians, etc. Because we all naturally identify with our own. It&rsquo;s just that whites are made to feel criminal for it. </p>
<p>While I know the current regime is going to collapse and whites will regain control of their destiny, it&rsquo;s a shame that by the time this happens, Jane Elliott will most likely have passed away. I hope she lives a long enough life to be put on trial for her crimes against humanity and is given the sentence she deserves. </p>
<p>I have read various stories and reports about Ms. Elliott that claim she is homosexual. Is this true?  If so, it would explain some of her stances in other areas. No matter what her orientation, she is a crackpot who should have been locked up decades ago. </p>

		<p>Last night I was having a chat with a woman who&rsquo;s parents were born and raised in Cambodia. She herself was born here in Australia and spoke English like a natural. I did notice a few inflections in some words that she used and when I mentioned it she got very upset and began starting all of her sentences with &#8220;You whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I realised where the inflections were coming from when she got upset, it was hip-hop culture. Her own person mixed Asian-European culture has adopted the worst parts of African-American culture. After a short while she admitted that she thinks all Whites judge her because of the colour of her skin and all the worlds problems are our fault. She then proceeded to tell me that only Whites could be racist without actually saying it which I have to admit was quite amusing to me. I knew she wanted to say it but couldn&rsquo;t because she was surrounded by Whites in a White built and run country. Everything she enjoys in her day to day life has been created by our people and she couldn&rsquo;t resolve that inconsistency. I know she&rsquo;s been brainwashed by the most wretched portion of American society but she can&rsquo;t self-reflect on what she has accepted as truth when in fact it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I watched this programme with my (also racially aware) friend last night. It was very interesting viewing, and I recommend seeing it. It is still available at the &#8216;channel 4 on demand&rsquo; site, and is called &#8216;how racist are you?&rsquo;. <br>
Because liberal whites are so over confident of their unchallenged assertions, and because some blacks do not have the sense to hide their true feelings and emotions, it is the kind of programme where a lot of interesting insight can be gained.<br>
Ms Elliot doesn&rsquo;t just say that whites are &#8216;conditioned from birth&rsquo; into feeling superior. She goes even further and says &#8216;in fact, we are conditioned from BEFORE birth&rsquo;. How can you be conditioned from before birth? Clearly, what she and blacks are so angry about is that we are innately different from before birth. Unable to accept this fact they transfer their jeolousy and hatred onto us and dress it up as our &#8216;racism&rsquo;.<br>
The whole blue colour/ eye colour set-up is supposed to demonstrate that all divisions and groupings are arbitrary and meaningless. But it is interesting to note that almost immediately the eye colour division becomes meaningless and the two groups start dividing along racial lines, with the brown-eyed whites either getting kicked-off the show or in one case deliberately sabotaging the stupid staged stunts. So, far from proving the meaninglessness of race it actually confirms its reality.<br>
I was left more optimistic about whites than before. Maybe the anti-racists are starting to push their luck too far, and demand too much, but the whites did not meekly roll over and accept their guilt. Their only problem was that they still believed being nice to minorities was enough, whereas for the minorities themselves it is obvious that nothing will ever be enough to eradicate their feelings of inferiority. If they are wise the whites will have glimpsed a vision of the future of life as a minority.</p>

		<p>I remember the brown eyes / blue eyes game from elementry school.  In my school they did not let us speak to each other for one day.  There was no taunting allowed.</p>
<p>I was one of three people in a group of two blue eyed people and one green eyed person.  (I have blue eyes and blond hair.)  All the rest of the people in the class had brown eyes.</p>
<p>The lesson I took from it was that I really did have something special.  Something that was quite rare.  Something that a great many people thought made me superior to others.  Up until then, I thought I was superior because I got some of the highest grades in the whole school on all the tests.  (There were several kids who rarely missed any questions and were already a grade ahead in mathmatics including the other blue eyed kid at the table with me.  The vast majority of the high achievers had blue eyes and were in the other classes at the school.)</p>
<p>There was a subtle feeling at the time that I could not put into words until almost twenty years later:  &#8220;How dare you show us up and look good at the same time?&#8221;  This is like telling an athlete that he cheated by being born stronger and faster than most of his rivals.  </p>
<p>Afterall, I still had the very traits that inspired the lesson.</p>

<p>I went through a diversity training session in 2007. There moderators were a Black woman and a White male. As was the case with your session, there were a number of people (including myself) who were very candid in our opinions about affirmative action, interracial marriage, immigration, hostility against White males etc&hellip; There were some particiapants who felt that Whites did have siginificant advantages. </p>
<p>Both the Black female and White male moderators would respond with some good points that could not be dismissed, however, there other points they made that some of us would effectively refute. At the end of the session, I do not know how much was actually accomplished, but nothing got out of hand and people did engage in a respectful and civil dialogue with one another.  Theree was no screaming and finger pointing. I am not saying that these things do not happen, but they did not take place happen during my session.</p>

		<p>Saying &#8220;all whites are racist&#8221; is about as racist as saying, &#8220;all blacks are lazy.&#8221;  What a stupid premise.  The blacks have really nothing to point to that would indicate they have produced modern, civilized, peaceful, living - not in Africa, not in Haiti, and certainly not in any city in the U.S. where they are in control (Detroit, Chicago, etc.)  Nope, any place where blacks rule you can absolutely count on finding brutality, crime, corruption, graft, drugs, prostitution, child abandonment and endangerment, cruelty to animals   &mdash;   you name the negative, and there it is.  No argument can make these facts go away.  THIS IS TRUE.  And all the whiny black supremecists can squall &#8220;Racism!&#8221; all they want - but the evidence is very clear.

She claims to be a teacher.  What have her students learned that is worth anything.  I suggest they have learned that Jane Elliott is an bitter old woman who is dissatisfied with her own life and blames her race for it.  She has absolutely no idea what she is talking about.  Therefore she is quite fit to be featured on PBS Frontline and other such dribble.  If you tell the truth, the media will shun you.

<p>Who is this woman talking to?  Jane Elliott or her small staff of helpers?  Jane Elliott doesn&rsquo;t care whether or not white people are the victims of racism.  Jane Elliott is going to deny that white people can even be the victims of racism at all.  To admit otherwise would expose the fraud behind her claims that only white people can be racist which are solely designed to keep whites feeling guilty and to add more layers of preexisting guilt for the purpose of morally disarming whites for the purpose of keeping whites from acting in their own interest while all the other ethnic groups,  whos populations are rapidly growing, act very strongly in their respective collective interests.  <br>

		<p>Is there a chance   &mdash;  just a chance, for purposes of discussion  &mdash;   that the white race might actually BE superior?  </p>
<p>After all, Back Home In Africa The Glorious Origin Of All Humankind, nobody ever invented electricity, or polio vaccine, or mass production, or encyclopedias, or &hellip;  but you get my drift.</p>
<p>Maybe the race that had all the ideas is, in fact, a better race.  </p>
<p>OR &hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s not necessarily race-based at all.  Maybe the CULTURE that created Western Civilization is in fact superior, and the various tribal cultures that permeate Africa and the Middle East are demonstrably inferior.  Are we allowed to point to cultural achievement and not skin-color as the basis for judgment?  (And if not, why not?  Do we really care if the racial-grievance-mongers lose their influence?)</p>
<p>After all, now we have a bi-racial man in the White House.  How color-blind (and achievement-blind) are we expected to be in order to satisfy the whining racists like Ms Elliot who think blacks can&rsquo;t succeed unless whites give them special treatment?  (Yes, the ones who so publicly beat the drum of &#8220;racism&#8221; ARE the racists; the ones who judge on achievement are NOT.  There are high-achievers and non-achievers of every race and color; achievers get hired and get promoted; lazy whiners do not.)  </p>
<p>The idea of blaming whites for the deficiencies of non-whites serves to deflect attention away from the inadequacies of an under-achieving population.  Race apologists want to pressure mainstream society to &#8220;make allowances&#8221; and treat their &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; group as if they were equal in knowledge and ability (instead of insisting that the members of that group get an education and a job, follow cultural norms of prudence, thrift and responsibility, and generally raise themselves to the level of the greater society).  As long as the demands for action are made only upon white society, and the &#8220;unequal&#8221; racial group is not held responsible for improving its success in society by changing its own behavior/culture, the activists will always have an inadequate population that &#8220;needs their help&#8221; to succeed.  Job security for the professional race-agitators!</p>

		<p>For the benefit of JasonC and anyone else interested - the UK Justice Department DOES maintain statistics on ethnic crime. See here:</p>
<p><a href="/publications/docs/stats-race-criminal-justice-system-07-08-revised.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/stats-race-criminal-justice-system-07-08-revised.pdf</a></p>
<p>From the above PDF you can see that in the UK blacks account for 2.2% of the population but 10.6% of admissions to prison. I don&rsquo;t doubt that admission to prison correlates directly with criminality.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t record ethnic conviction rates - that would be interesting but perhaps a little to inflamatory for the government to risk.<br>

		<p>Non-whites have an inferiority complex towards whites. That is why they lash out at the invisible apparition that is &#8220;racism.&#8221; I believe a lot of it is merely physical. They simply can&rsquo;t deal with being around people that much more beautiful than them. </p>
<p>How do I know this? I&rsquo;m half Chinese. I know it is quite easy to feel jealous of whites that can actually grow a decent beard, that have piercing blue eyes instead of my dull brown-green ones, that have stronger builds, more dashing features, and better artistic ability, even though I&rsquo;m a terrific artist, there&rsquo;s just something I can&rsquo;t grasp when it comes to true brilliance. But, as is, I&rsquo;m happy looking white for the large part. I spent time at a party on Halloween night here in upper Manhattan, a party entirely dominated by blacks and Latinos. I can&rsquo;t really count the number of times I was referred to as &#8220;white boy.&#8221; But that&rsquo;s enough to make me fairly happy.</p>
<p>Do I wish I was white? Do I envy people that know what they are and lack physical and mental characteristics that I do? Of course. But does that make me so blinded with rage towards them for not being one of them that I want them to disappear from the earth? Absolutely not. Quite the contrary. I want them to survive in full, so much so that I&rsquo;m willing to lay my life on the line for it. Because the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221;, miscegenators, and the multiculturalists are evil. The non-whites that chase white women of impossible beauty are evil. The non-whites that chase white men are evil. (My mother was one of them). This is one thing I&rsquo;ve garnered through the moral blessings I&rsquo;ve been granted through eastern and western blood. Anyone that seeks to threaten the existence of white childen is evil. The diversifiers are sadistic and genocidal. Nothing more, nothing less. Whites, you&rsquo;ve got a friend in me.</p>
<p>But again, don&rsquo;t worry. I intend to marry a woman that is of northeast asian and white heritage just like me. I am, naturally, against race mixing, even for myself. I&rsquo;m just part of a new race that should never have existed in the first place.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I suggest that Jane Elliott is an bitter old woman who is dissatisfied with her own life and blames her race for it.&#8221;<br>
   &mdash;   Unreconstructed</p>
<p>That sounds about right. But, ironically, she is probably the richest person in her little town. And certainly the only celebrity there, in Riceville, Iowa. <br>
She has done quite well, peddling race hate. Nice work if you can get it!</p>

  &#8220;I went through a diversity training session in 2007. The moderators were a Black woman and a White male. As was the case with your session,  a number of people (including myself) were very candid in our opinions about affirmative action, interracial marriage, immigration, hostility against White males,  etc&hellip; There were some participants who felt that Whites did have significant advantages&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Not to criticize,  but why would you tell her your candid opinions?  What was the point?  You can&rsquo;t win.  You&rsquo;re a captive.   If I had to go to such a session, I would just sit there, as required, but would not participate any more than I had to. I would offer no comments or opinions.  I would volunteer nothing. I would go through whatever nonsense gamesthey require, watching the clock until the hell session is over. Neither would I want to get identified by management as a &#8220;problem&#8221; &hellip; one perhaps in need of further training. Or watching!  If specifically ASKED, &#8220;What do you think about such and such&#8221;&hellip; I would say I have no opinion on the matter. Or  I have no knowledge of it.  If pressed further, I would say that my mind is my own and my opinions are private.  I don&rsquo;t care to discuss it. Period!  </p>
<p>In other words, I would attend if my presence is <i>required, </i>since I&rsquo;m being PAID for it and can&rsquo; refuse.  But I would not allow them to pick my brain!   There&rsquo;s absolutely no point in arguing with them or telling them what your opinion is because they don&rsquo;t care what your opinions are and the instructor is going to win anyway.  It&rsquo;s rigged that way.   So just sit through it,   don&rsquo;t argue,  hold your tongue,  and count the minutes.</p>

		<p>#55; fair enough,  but somehow, someway, you must have a need to be heard. How about joining white organizations? That is my big issue. Support our organizations and our leaders. AmRen obviously, but others in the links section.</p>

		<p>If she hates whites so much why doesn&rsquo;t she move to a non-white country? Reggie</p>
<p>    Why indeed Reggie? Where else could she make such a good living peddling nonsense? In academia she is still much admired. I consider her a charlatan.</p>

<p>The burgeoning Race Industry has proven very profitable for quite a few sharp-eyed people who were quick to get in on it    &mdash;     a whole new career field!</p>
<p>It imposes different requirements, though.   <br>
For blacks like Sharpton, they can peddle racial grievance. They can collect praise and benefits.  <br>
For Whites like Elliott, they must peddle racial guilt. They have to grovel, repent, and hand out apologies. (Even if someone else ultimately pays the price.)</p>
<p>Now who is being discriminated against here?</p>
