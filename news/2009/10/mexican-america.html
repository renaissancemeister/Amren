<h1>Mexican-Americans Have Deep U.S. Ties</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tomás Jiménez, CNN, October 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just about any celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15  &mdash;  October 15) will highlight the diversity among Hispanics.</p>
<p>They come from different parts of the Spanish-speaking world, have settled in various areas of the United States, have distinctive customs and come in all shapes and colors.</p>
<p>But an often overlooked difference among Hispanics relates to how many generations back they trace their roots in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Hispanics are not just immigrants or the U.S.-born children of immigrants. They are also Americans with deep family histories in the United States. This is especially true of the Mexican-origin population, the largest Hispanic subgroup and one that has been continually replenished by immigrant newcomers for a century.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Latino in America&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Truly knowing what it means to be a person of Mexican origin requires understanding the experiences of the nearly 3 in 10 (8.5 million) Mexican-Americans who were born in the United States to U.S.-born parents.</p>
<p>These later-generation Mexican-Americans&rsquo; experience in the United States, though rooted in a distant past, is nonetheless deeply affected by current and uninterrupted immigration from their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p>In some ways, Mexican-Americans have lived what amounts to a classic tale of assimilation.</p>
<p>They speak English (and no Spanish in the majority of cases), intermarry in large numbers, live in ethnically mixed neighborhoods, work in just about every imaginable profession, are honored on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, occupy important political positions and are highly patriotic. But ongoing Mexican immigration puts a twist on this classic assimilation tale, making &#8220;Mexicanness&#8221; relevant to later-generation Mexican-Americans in both problematic and enjoyable ways.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Surnames that end in &#8220;ski&#8221; or start with &#8220;O&rsquo;&#8221; are woven into the fabric of American ethnic surnames. But &#8220;García,&#8221; &#8220;Fernandez&#8221; and &#8220;Martínez&#8221; remain bright threads that, combined with dark skin color, can make Mexican-Americans and other Hispanics seem foreign in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Ask the later-generation descendants of earlier waves of Mexican immigrants, and they&rsquo;ll tell you that &#8220;Where are you from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, where are you really from?&#8221; are questions that they have to field all too often. And even if it&rsquo;s clear that they are Mexican-Americans, they still get quizzed about how well they speak Spanish. Assumptions about them being foreign turn from annoying to downright scary when law enforcement personnel suspect them of being illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corporations, retailers, political parties and churches are all trying to grab a slice of the &#8220;Hispanic market,&#8221; the overwhelming majority of which is Mexican. Retail marketing campaigns, sprinkles of the Spanish language in political speeches and Mexican-themed media are generally aimed at the immigrant audience. All of this attention adds cachet to Mexican ancestry that even later-generation individuals enjoy.</p>

		<p>Nice timing, because I am dealing with the concept of assimilation on my own blog today.  Sam Francis once noted that:  (1) The very concept of &#8220;assimilation&#8221; has been watered down; it used to mean other white people grokking the folkways of native born white Americans, but now means non-whites going to shopping malls.  (2)  There used to be pressure put on the shoulders of immigrant whites by native born American whites to assimilate, so much so that it would be a violation of civil rights laws if done today, but it&rsquo;s moot because it is impossible to force a Somalian or Hmong to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; truly no matter how much pressure they feel.</p>

<p>I know, those racist cops. They should be focusing on all of those Swedes coming across our border illegally!<br>

		<p>October is Polish awareness month. The Poles helped us to win the American Revelution and sided with us on many wars. <br>
   The hispanics did nothing during the American Revolution, and we fight wars against them in 1846 and 1898. The Hispanic world is Anti-American. That is what we should be aware of.</p>

		<p>Except for a tiny minority, Mexican-Americans have NOT lived the classic tale of assimilation. Not how I think of the classic tale of assimilation. The majority of Europeans, from the different nations they came from, cut their ties to those nations and truly did live the classic tale of immigration. Mexicans, for a large part, have always had greater allegiance towards Mexico than to the U.S., even after having lived here a lifetime. This has been shown a thousand times with Mexicans attitudes on politics, language, sporting contests, and other things, when they came into conflict with other Americans views.</p>

		<p>All talk of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in America is an exercize in pure deception and sleight of hand. The Mexicans this artice is largely refering to are NOT the five-foot-tall, dark brown Mestizo Amerinds that have flooded into this country in the past few decades. Any number of folks from(or still in) Mexico are of European, or primarily European descent, and are an altogether different phenomena from the more recent alien tidal-wave! </p>
<p>This whole topic of who or what a &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; even is drives me bananas!!<br>

		<p>Living in a fantasyland is CNN.  I live in the Atlanta area, just a couple of miles from the city limits. I know too much about CNN, but even more about the hispanic community in the metro Atlanta area.  Since I am in construction, I work with hispanics everyday. It&rsquo;s just the way it is. For the most part they have no interest in learning English, even the ones born here. I have talked to them and they say they have no need of English, for their communities are so large, their neighborhoods so extensive, that they can get everything they need without really learning English.  They, like most immigrants of recent decades, are here for one reason and one reason only.  To MAKE MONEY.  CNN in Atlanta is often regarded as a joke, as fewer and fewer people watch it here.</p>

		<p>Mexicans in this country have a greater allegiance to &#8220;Cinco de Mayo&#8221; than to the Fourth of July, even if they were born here.</p>
<p>Flyingtiger, you are correct when you say that Hispanics, mestizos and Latinos (take your pick) did absolutely NOTHING during our war for independence. That&rsquo;s because Spain was busy administering her colonies in Florida, California and the Southwest. I never heard of any soldiers named Escobar, Gomez, Hernandez, Lopez, Salazar, Hermosa or Carrera in the Continental Army ranks.</p>
<p>Speaking of colonies, St. Augustine FL was founded in 1519 by Spain - the oldest city in the United States. Yet, it&rsquo;s never mentioned in the same breath with Jamestown, VA or Plymouth, MA as early American settlements - I wonder why. LOL </p>
