<h1>Report: Global Muslim Population Hits 1.57 Billion</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Gorski, Yahoo! News, October 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The global Muslim population stands at 1.57 billion, meaning that nearly 1 in 4 people in the world practice Islam, according to a report Wednesday billed as the most comprehensive of its kind.</p>
<p>The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life report provides a precise number for a population whose size has long has been subject to guesswork, with estimates ranging anywhere from 1 billion to 1.8 billion.</p>
<p>The project, three years in the making, also presents a portrait of the Muslim world that might surprise some. For instance, Germany has more Muslims than Lebanon, China has more Muslims than Syria, Russia has more Muslims than Jordan and Libya combined, and Ethiopia has nearly as many Muslims as Afghanistan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pew officials call the report the most thorough on the size and distribution of adherents of the world&rsquo;s second largest religion behind Christianity, which has an estimated 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion followers.</p>
<p>The arduous task of determining the Muslim populations in 232 countries and territories involved analyzing census reports, demographic studies and general population surveys, the report says. In cases where the data was a few years old, researchers projected 2009 numbers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report provides further evidence that while the heart of Islam might beat in the Middle East, its greatest numbers lie in Asia: More than 60 percent of the world&rsquo;s Muslims live in Asia.</p>
<p>About 20 percent live in the Middle East and North Africa, 15 percent live in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2.4 percent are in Europe and 0.3 percent are in the Americas. While the Middle East and North Africa have fewer Muslims overall than Asia, the region easily claims the most Muslim-majority countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s other highlights:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Europe is home to about 38 million Muslims, or about five percent of its population. Germany appears to have more than 4 million Muslims  &mdash;  almost as many as North and South America combined. In France, where tensions have run high over an influx of Muslim immigrant laborers, the overall numbers were lower but a larger percentage of the population is Muslim.</p>
<p>* Of roughly 4.6 million Muslims in the Americas, more than half live in the United States although they only make up 0.8 percent of the population there. About 700,000 people in Canada are Muslim, or about 2 percent of the total population.</p>
<p>A future Pew Forum project, scheduled to be released in 2010, will build on the report&rsquo;s data to estimate growth rates among Muslim populations and project future trends.</p>

		<p>There are more non-white Muslims in the world than there are white non-Muslims in the world.  That shows you how few in number us whites are.  As a matter of fact, there are more Han Chinese in China than whites in the whole world.</p>

		<p>This is a frightening fact and the trend only gets worse each year.  Islam is expanding via conquest, conversion, and birth rates on all continents.  It will become the majority in Africa, Europe, and Russia this century, it is even taking over India.</p>
<p>People need to ask themselves what makes Islam so powerful that it is conquering the world?  It&rsquo;s economy is weak, its military is weak, its people are low IQ, so why is it winning the game of life?</p>
<p>Two things   &mdash;   First, Islam has a Nietzschean will to power that lets it do whatever it wants without apology or guilt.  Second, it controls female reproduction.</p>
<p>If whites adopted these two traits, we could fight Islam on an even basis.  If we don&rsquo;t, we will fall to Islam and these policies will be instituted anyway.  Evolution never loses.  A group&rsquo;s fitness is more directly linked to their laws and morality than any physical or mental trait.  All the intelligence in the world cannot save you if your women have a birth rate of 1.0.</p>

		<p>There are also around a billion and a half Catholics, but, of course, not all of them are White.  They also are not allowed to have sex, I think.  At any rate, the problem is keeping muslims out of White lands.  The key to that, as is all the other problems in the White world, is to destroy the marxists.  </p>
<p>And Diamed, the Muslims are not stupid.  While I do agree that White women need to have more babies and less sex, don&rsquo;t underestimate the muslim world.  It would also help if we stayed the hell out of their business and their countries.</p>

<p>The White race did have these things once and half of that race renounced it and allied with the non-white races.</p>
<p>As I touched on in the other thread about the Burhka in Canada now we will see what happens when Islam comes very face to face with Western feminism. I think feminism will destroy Islam in Western nations within 20 years and will make serious roads into the cradle of Islam as well during that time.</p>
<p>I will rub my hands together in glee to watch these two &#8220;doctrines&#8221; go at each other.</p>

		<p>One of the proudest achievements of Western Civilization is our hard-won tradition of tolerance, gained after centuries of strife and warfare.  After much suffering, we finally learned to respect one another.  But this respect has to be mutual.  For us, it has worked well   &mdash;    at least when practiced amongst ourselves.   But when you let into your midst  people from an alien culture which does not value or even recognize  such a concept,  that  shifts the balance and  alters the whole equation.</p>
<p>At present, our great respect for tolerance and our reluctance to regulate or interfere with  religion  are being used, very cunningly,  to undermine and weaken us. There are those among us who are taking advantage of this and are turning what was one of our strengths into our weakness.   We may have to chose between unfettered religion and survival.  Which shall it be?</p>
<p>I am all for tolerance, but not when it is used as a weapon against us.  As someone else has said, the Bill of Rights was not meant to be a suicide pact.</p>

<p>The last time that I checked  &mdash;   and every time before that  &mdash;   the Middle East is part of Asia!?! So is most of (Islamic) Turkey and most of Russia. The contemporary American notion of using &#8220;Asian American&#8221; as an ethnic, rather than a geographical, denotation of heritage is even more ludicrous than that of &#8220;African American&#8221;  &mdash;   which ignores not only the European-African component of Africa (e.g., in South Africa), but also the fact that North Africa is predominantly Arab, with remnants of pre-Arabian populations. Yet, the same PC-addled folk who insist on using &#8220;African American&#8221; and &#8220;Asian American&#8221; as the most &#8220;ethnically sensitive&#8221; labels for blacks and Orientals, respectively, are, of course, the very last ever to refer to European Americans as such.</p>

		<p>I hope intelligent Feminists will meditate on the impact of this for women. Western societies, that they hate so much, are ones that treat women the best. Islam considers women to be two legged livestock, and treats women accordingly. </p>

But this means instituting national socialism. Currently unsellable.<br>

<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s one out of every three human was a White brother or sister. Whites were the largest race and were still growing. Many Whites lamented how certain primitive races like blacks and primitive civilizations would disappear from the planet. Many spoke of a future where only the advanced Whites and Yellows would survive with the primitive browns, blacks and reds would disappear.</p>
<p> Several decades of feminism, Marxist liberalism, blind soulless consumerism, modernism, lack of will, destruction of traditional values, lack of concern for the future of the race etc&hellip; has made the White race itself endangered.</p>

If whites adopted a &#8216;Nietzschean will to power&rsquo; as you put it we could do far far more then that.</p>
<p>Ah well, there&rsquo;s always eastern europe and russia.  Read recently about how Russia has over half the world&rsquo;s neo-nazis(I can understand Russian neo-nazism, as you can always point out that Hitler and the Nazis did pick certain slavs for germanization).  While most(not all - they&rsquo;re more than a leaderless rabble and the organization of some of the groups is frankly nothing short of amazing) of those types tend to be rather unintelligent degenerates, it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>The question I keep asking myself is that if we as a race aren&rsquo;t willing to stand up and prevent our demise, do we really deserve to exist at all?</p>

		<p>Now that we Western countries have all of these wonderful welfare programs, and soon we&rsquo;ll have ObamaCare too, couples can have as many children as they can produce without having to worry about little things like how to pay for all of them.</p>
<p>In this environment it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if some Ayatolla doesn&rsquo;t order all Muslim couples to have 10 children.  That would be an increase of 5 times for each generation.  We&rsquo;ve got about 3 million Muslims in the USA right now.  </p>
<p>Do the math: 3 x 5 =15 million in one generation<br>
Do the math: 15 x 5 =75 million in two generations<br>
Do the math: 75 x 5 =375 million in three generations</p>
<p>Once they have a majority I guess this country will get to live with the joys of Sharia law, honor killings, and all of the other wonderful things that come with Muslim rule.</p>
<p>Seriously: When are we Western white people going to wake up?  What is it going to take?  Is there going to be blood in the streets before we do something?</p>

It has to be well published blood in the streets and even then the leftist/progressive/liberal/feminist will try and say whites deserved it and the main stream media will gloss over it.</p>

		<p>I wonder how a religion described by French writer and philosopher Voltaire as a religion that even dogs wouldn&rsquo;t want, is becoming so widespread, on the planet. I mean, it,s not like Islam promises joy, freedom, happiness&hellip; All it offers is the imposed (or self-imposed) hardships of a medieval cult!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Europe is home to about 38 million muslims&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>WRONG! Europe is NOT &#8220;their&#8221; home. It is where they have invaded. With the exception of the treasonous Bosniaks and the Albanians who &#8216;turned Turk&rsquo; after the Ottoman conquest there is no indigenous muslim people in Europe. The Albanians represent the most corrupt,  poorest and crime-prone country and culture in Europe. As for Bosnia, what culture or arts has it ever produced?</p>

		<p>So, when the muslims take over, who will they go after first? It will probably be the feminists, gays, liberals, and other groups that just love diversity and tolerance. Here in the US, if two men are &#8220;out and proud&#8221;, about the worst they will get is a dirty look or a snide comment. Over in Afghanistan, they will be thrown off of a building or have that building bulldozed in on top of them. For a good example of this, look up the name &#8220;Irshad Manji&#8221;. She is able to do what she pleases because of the protection of her rights by western governments. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that when she does visit predominantly muslim nations that she has to have a Blackwater type of protective service at the ready. </p>
<p>About the only feminist I have ever heard of that takes a really dim view of the muslim world is a woman named Phyllis Chesler. She was actually married to a muslim and lived in Afghanistan in the early 1960&rsquo;s. The following is from her web site:</p>
<p>She writes, &#8220;The Afghanistan I knew was a prison, a police state, a feudal monarchy, a theocracy, rank with fear and paranoia&hellip; [It] was a bastion of illiteracy, poverty, preventable and treatable diseases; yet that was not the worst of it [for women]&hellip;. The overwhelming domestic and psychological misery was worse and it consisted of arranged marriages, polygamy, forced pregnancies, the chadari, domestic slavery, and, of course, purdah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having served in the Middle East, I have little to no tolerance for whiny feminists who gripe about their lot in life. Even the women who serve over there tend to get a quick reality check when they see how good they have it in the US.   </p>

		<p>With hindsight this was completely predictable. We really should have seen it coming. Is there no end to the pathetic idolisation of this man? Before he was even in office there were cries for a national day of celebration in his name. Why not just sanctify him and have done with it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the same &#8216;honour&rsquo; being awarded to Mandela.  South Africa is a far less civilised and peaceful place than it once was. As one of the most dangerous countries in the world descends further into a cesspit of violence and horror, I wonder how the countless victims of brutality and rape feel about his award now several decades later.</p>
<p>It seems that any person with sub-Saharan ancestry who is raised above the gutter, and beyond the common existence of basic street thuggery into a recognisable political figure, is automatically eligible for an international award. </p>
<p>That particular little gaggle of politically correct Norwegians need to get off their high horse and perhaps spend some time in the real world. I doubt they&rsquo;d survive long enough in an American, European or African inner city to appoint the following year&rsquo;s prize winner. </p>

		<p>With all the doom and gloom, I think I should put up some good news for us.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s, I think our race was in the worst shape ever. Our birth rate had just plunged down to 1.5 child/woman worldwide, but the rest of the world, including the Muslims, had birth rates four times higher. That&rsquo;s right, the white race had a birth rate only one-quarter that of nonwhites.</p>
<p>Now, however, things are different. While unfortunately our birth rate is still at 1.6 child/woman, it appears to be finally increasing after the collapse of Eastern European birth rates in the 1990s. The average for developing countries, according to the Population Reference Bureau, is now 2.7 and continuing to drop. <i>The white race now has a birth rate 60% that of nonwhites, up from 25-30% in 1975.</i> Muslim rates have come down from their astronomical heights, and now in fact the Maghreb countries are worried about being overrun with Sub-Saharan Africans. Mexico&rsquo;s birth rate is now barely higher than the USA&rsquo;s, and Brazil&rsquo;s is in fact lower than ours. Ireland and Iceland are now equal with Turkey. Et cetera.</p>
