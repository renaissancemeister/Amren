<h1>Free Money From Obama&rsquo;s Stash</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Combs Spouts Off, October 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Remember when they promised us the $780 billion in &#8220;stimulus&#8221; spending would produce jobs, funding shovel-ready projects that would get the economy moving? Not in Detroit. There, they just created a lottery for free money. Instead of creating jobs, they stimulated a chaotic mob scene, with fights and injuries and a near-riot. Welcome to Obama&rsquo;s redistributionist America.</p>
<p>Via The Virginian, here are a couple of transcripts of WJR&rsquo;s Ken Rogulski interviewing some free money lottery participants (emphasis added):<blockquote>ROGULSKI: Why are you here?</p>
<p>WOMAN #1: To get some money.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: What kind of money?</p>
<p>WOMAN #1: Obama money.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: Where&rsquo;s it coming from?</p>
<p>WOMAN #1: Obama.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: And where did Obama get it?</p>
<p>WOMAN #1: I don&rsquo;t know, his stash. I don&rsquo;t know. (laughter) I don&rsquo;t know where he got it from, but he givin&rsquo; it to us, to help us.</p>
<p>WOMAN #2: And we love him.</p>
<p>WOMAN #1: We love him. That&rsquo;s why we voted for him!</p>
<p>WOMEN: (chanting) Obama! Obama! Obama! (laughing)<br>
</blockquote>And the other one:<br>
<blockquote>ROGULSKI: Did you get an application to fill out yet?</p>
<p>WOMAN: I sure did. And I filled it out, and I am waiting to see what the results are going to be.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: Will you know today how much money you&rsquo;re getting?</p>
<p>WOMAN: No, I won&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m waiting for a phone call.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: Where&rsquo;s the money coming from?</p>
<p>WOMAN: I believe it&rsquo;s coming from the City of Detroit or the state.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: Where did they get it from?</p>
<p>WOMAN: Some funds that was forgiven [sic] by Obama.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: And where did Obama get the funds?</p>
<p>WOMAN: Obama getting the funds from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ummm, I have no idea, to tell you the truth. He&rsquo;s the president.</p>
<p>ROGULSKI: In downtown Detroit, Ken Rogulski, WJR News.<br>

								<h2>Free Money Mob at Cobo Center</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Corey Williams, WUPW-TV (Toledo), October 8, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Scuffles erupted as several thousand Detroit residents jockeyed, pushed and shoved Wednesday to get free money being offered to only 3,500 of the city&rsquo;s recently or soon to be homeless.</p>
<p>Several received medical treatment for fainting or exhaustion while frantically trying to obtain the applications for federal housing assistance. The long lines and short tempers highlighted the frustration and desperation that Detroit residents feel struggling through an economic nightmare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the Detroit Police Department&rsquo;s Gang Squad and other tactical units were called in for crowd control. Several people reportedly passed out from exhaustion and had to be treated by emergency medical personnel. Some minor injuries were reported, and no arrests were made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before Wednesday, Detroit Planning and Development workers already had spent two days handling long lines at City Hall and other locations. Rumors that $3,000 stimulus checks from the Obama administration spurred heavy turnouts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city distributed more than 50,000 applications for the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing program over the past several days before running out Wednesday morning. Only 3,500 people who qualify will receive the money  &mdash;  a maximum $3,000 per applicant, Dumas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be considered, applicants must have lived in Detroit for the past six months, been homeless within the past year and be of low to moderate income. A single applicant is ineligible with an income of more than $24,850 annually; the maximum annual income for an eligible family of four is $35,500.</p>
<p>Individuals and families meeting the income criteria and facing eviction and foreclosure also are eligible. Being able to maintain housing after getting the assistance also is a condition of the program.</p>
<p>The program also provides money to keep utilities turned on.</p>
<p>The deadline to submit applications  &mdash;  originally Wednesday  &mdash;  has been extended a week because of the &#8220;enormous number&#8221; distributed, she added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Already, some of this &#8220;stash,&#8221; at least the food stamps, have been illegally used to buy non-food items in Detroit.  It&rsquo;s a scam that involves the store owner &#8220;scanning in&#8221; a very large food stamp purchase in exchange for some less expensive non-food item.</p>

		<p>I was just telling a friend about this the other day, how blacks think the gubmint is just a big bottomless well of cash.  She didn&rsquo;t seem to believe me, so I explained cargo cults to her.  It&rsquo;s hard for whites who don&rsquo;t pay close attention to racial issues to understand the common black mentality level.  Hell, I don&rsquo;t understand it, so maybe that&rsquo;s not the word I&rsquo;m looking for; it&rsquo;s hard for whites to ACCEPT the common black mentality level.</p>

Marxists (and their puppets) believe that there is a cache of money horded by the wealthy to which they&rsquo;re denied access. These people don&rsquo;t seem to grasp how money and wealth are created through work.</p>
<p>Of course, in theory, you could take all the money of the world and redistribute it equally to everyone. However, there are those who would use it wisely to build wealth and those who would spend it frivolously. At that point, you&rsquo;re back where you started; those who have money because they made money work for them and those who spent it foolishly and are left with nothing. </p>

<p>I think I know what your saying. Where I work the resident Alpha Angry Black Man pontificates EVERYDAY. There have been some inner city shootings recently with some &#8220;Honor Student&#8221; Afros being shot down. AABM was in a rage and part of his explanation was that &#8220;They be puttin the Guns in our Community&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t have to wonder too much as to the &#8220;They&#8221; is, De is Whitey. <br>
I mean I&rsquo;m white and quite frankly I wish there wasn&rsquo;t so much crime in Afro neighborhoods, just behave yourself but I guss thats expecting too much.</p>

<p>In short, the black that did it got multiple suspended imposition of sentences (SIS) for felonies.  He did one felony, got an SIS for it, and when he committed another one, the previous SIS was not revoked and him sent to prison.  His punishment for violating the first SIS and also the second felony was another SIS on top of an SIS.  It&rsquo;s pandemic in the St. Louis circuit.  One cop on St. Louis Cop Talk tells me that he&rsquo;s heard of a four SIS pile-up for one person in St. Louis City.</p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s law re SIS is deficient because the SIS doesn&rsquo;t show up on your rap sheet at all, even if you&rsquo;re currently serving the SIS.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Another sad read&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I read the story you linked and it was indeed horrible.</p>
<p>The most important lesson comes from this line in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Had she had her gun with her, those suspects would have never gotten into that house&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe the Whites that are left in St. Louis and live within striking distance of black communities could learn a few things from us California Whites as we are being outnumbered and surrounded increasingly by the dangerous Third World.</p>
<p>Learn to handle guns  &mdash;  women especially.  Wall your property off with 9-foot high concrete barriers.  Always drive with your car doors locked, no exception.  Acquire a large, ferocious-looking dog with a loud snarling, menacing bark.  Be wary of your surroundings at all times.  If your neighbors are friendly, organize a neighborhood watch and post signs.  Invest in a good security system.  Always lock your doors whether you are home are out, close ground-floor windows at night, the newer ones even have locks.  Light up your property at night  &mdash;  my entire neighborhood is fully lit every night from spotlights, street lights, porch lights.</p>
<p>One of my new neighbors, immediately after installing 9-foot concrete walls around his property, placed cameras along the top.  In fact, many of my neighbors have installed cameras around their property  &mdash;  one told me it&rsquo;s so he can keep an eye on his property during the day.</p>
<p>Wealthier Californians have retreated into guard-gated communities that boast &#8216;armed response.&rsquo;  Most new up-scale type housing or condo developments in So.Cal advertise that they are gated.  </p>
<p>This has become a way of life in California, how a lot of us must live now, whether we like it or not, in order to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe from harm.</p>

		<p>I have seen many photographs and video documentaries of sick, hungry black african adults and children in the continent of africa and they looked nothing like these huge round faced well fed blacks, nor do they yell, scream and generally behave with a mob mentality even though they are genuinely starving to death. Surely any Detroit resident drawing welfare is already registered with the City and it not beyond the wit of the authorities to apply these funds on a simple &#8216;needs&rsquo; basis and not necessarily $3,000 to each applicant. $24,850 equates to over £300 per week and there are millions in UK who manage to maintain an entire family alright on just such an income, albeit not being able to support a luxurious lifestyle.</p>

		<p>This is just incredible. I&rsquo;m almost speechless. For grown adults to be this stupid boggles the mind. &#8221; Obama&rsquo;s stash &#8221; indeed! This just goes to show, the ignorance of blacks know no bounds. I&rsquo;m sure though if someone explained to them this money is coming from every hard working tax payer in this country, it would make no difference to them.</p>
<p>Those were some of the best dressed, well fed looking homless people I&rsquo;VE ever seen. This reminds me of an e mail my mom sent me of Mrs. Obama working in a soup kitchen, and the black guy standing there in line to receive his food, was taking her picture with his 800 dollar phone. Go figure.</p>

<p>Remember also that American blacks have been raised from birth to believe that all Whites are rich and blacks are &#8216;poor&rsquo; because genocidal Whites stole everything from them.  They love obama because he is taking what they believe rightfully belongs to them (White wealth) and handing it to them  &mdash;  Free White Money, government confiscation of White property and increasing government harassment against Whites?  If you&rsquo;re black, what&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<p>What do you think blacks will do when the dollar finally collapses and the Free White Money and entitlements dry up?</p>
<p>See my post #10 as to what we Californians are doing  &mdash;  and wasting no time doing it.</p>
<p>You also post:</p>

<p>Did the article also mention that mrs. obama was wearing a pair of $540 shoes at the time?  Of course, the msm would never report that fact.  Could you imagine the coverage and outrage from the press if Mrs. Bush had worn such expensive &#8216;kicks&rsquo; to a food bank (of all places)?</p>

<p>Probably because the africans are being held in check by machine guns wielded by those who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to use them in an instant.  Shows how cheap life is in such hell-holes as Africa. </p>
<p>American blacks, who continue to fail and blame Whites for their failures, have no idea how good they have it living in White-created civilizations with bountiful opportunities and Free White Money made possible by a government that favors them.  </p>
<p>The limited cognitive abilities of blacks prevent them from realizing what the alternative is if they hadn&rsquo;t been born into a White Civilization  &mdash;  a short, brutal life marked by disease (especially AIDS) bloodshed and hunger.  </p>

		<p>A few years ago I was doing some electrical work at a law office and a black man was explaining his situation to the lawyer about why he needed to file for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>He had gotten a large government loan for his business, around a quarter of a million dollars. He opened his business and paid himself and his wife a nice salary for about 2 years before he was broke. </p>
<p>All of this is normal enough except when the lawyer ask him how much money he had taken in as income for the business in two year his answer was really surprising. He hadn&rsquo;t taken in a single dollar because no one showed up needing his services. </p>
<p>This guy sat in his office for two years and didn&rsquo;t see a single customer/client and still thought he was running a business. </p>

&ldquo;&hellip;they looked nothing like these huge round faced well fed blacks, nor do they yell, scream and generally behave with a mob mentality even though they are genuinely starving to death&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>American blacks are accustomed to yelling, cursing, criticizing, running their mouths indiscriminately, and in general saying whatever in the world they please.  They are totally free to do so .  They are so used to this freedom that they take it completely for granted. They don&rsquo;t realize that in most (nearly all) other countries of the world you  have to be very careful what you say&hellip; especially about government officials or  Those  In  Power.</p>
<p>I find it particularly ironic that they don&rsquo;t know where this privilege comes from or why    &mdash;  - yes it was those wicked white male founding fathers, who were slave-owners, and capitalists, and who are so much reviled today.   No African despot would tolerate such  brazen outspokenness, such insolence as blacks enjoy here.  People over there are expected to starve and die in silence, without complaining.   One murmured criticism of the regime or ruler and the offender would quickly disappear from the scene. As Bon said, they are &#8220;held in check by machine guns wielded by those who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to use them in an instant.&#8221;</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s coddled blacks  are the most fortunate, wealthy, and free blacks in the world. They have unbelievable opportunities proffered to them by a society that is practically handing these out on a silver platter and begging them to accept. Scholarships, interest-free loans, business advice, housing assistance, government contracts, hiring preference, special quotas&hellip; all provided at the expense of whites.  Yet they do nothing but complain and demand to be given more.</p>

Also to a followup on that story look at the crime statistics in that area.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Being able to maintain housing after getting the assistance also is a condition of the program.&#8221;  Ha! </p>
<p>If these folks could maintain housing, Detroit would look much prettier. </p>
<p>This is a waste of three grand per moocher. And how about that school system in Detroit; were those answers about where the money came from great or what?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you saps the answer you seek: the dough came from white and Asian owned businesses, weatlthy white people and a bit from the middle class. You losers pay nothing in taxes!</p>

		<p>The welfare state doesn&rsquo;t just reward dysfunctional behavior, it also encourages illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Most all of the blacks here are the grandchildren of blacks who moved from the south to Detroit in search of jobs, starting during the labor shortage of WWII, if I have heard correctly. Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? When there are no jobs, you pack up and move to where the jobs are. </p>
<p>Most people (of any race) do not particularly like to move. They like to stay put if possible. But economic reality more or less forces them to move. But then the modern welfare state was invented in the 60&rsquo;s. What should have happened in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s was that unemployed blacks left Detroit for greener pastures, leaving a smaller but still liveable city. But why move, when you can get free money?</p>
<p>There are any number of unskilled or semi-skilled jobs they could have taken. Lawn service, picking fruit, maybe even some of the less-technical aspects of the construction trade. But they didn&rsquo;t have to, because of government freebies. So there was a vacuum left, that Mexicans were more than happy to fill. (If Mexico had the same welfare benefits as Detroit, they would have stayed home too.)</p>
<p>George Bush (in)famously said, &#8220;They&rsquo;re coming here to do the jobs that americans just won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; A more honest translation of that should read, &#8220;They&rsquo;re coming here to do the jobs that blacks just won&rsquo;t do, because of free government money.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a mentality that people grow up with in the projects that says there is no shame in begging or going on welfare, even if you are perfectly capable to work and support yourself. Personally, I would rather die than become dependant on checks from the government, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>

		<p>Two stories, briefly:  Years ago I saw an old black-and-white clip of blacks from the early 1960s protesting that their welfare checks were too small.  Most of them were female, most were obese (but still able-bodied,) and most were smoking.  Now, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with smoking or being fat if you spent your own money to get that way.  But these women were screaming for more welfare money!  I remember watching the clip in amazement and thinking, &#8220;This is when we should have put a stop to the welfare craziness.  This clip should have been shown on every TV station in the early &rsquo;60s and maybe it would have woken some people up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1970s, I worked as a Directory Assistance operator.  Whenever the welfare checks were late, blacks would call us up screaming, wanting the phone number of whoever sent them their checks, so they could yell at them.  They never, ever knew the name of the government agency that sent them the checks.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care where the money comes from.  All they know is that they want the money, they&rsquo;re entitled to the money, they&rsquo;d better GET the money on time, oh, and by the way, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>

<p>When I was working in Chicago Public Schools anyone who claimed they were &#8220;homeless&#8221; was automatically given priority admission, free lunch, free transportation, free everything basically. I had a &#8220;homeless&#8221; pair of twins in my class. These children were better dressed than most people I know. The mother had a cell phone, fake nails, hair extentions, more pairs of shoes that I do, etc&hellip;The mother and her daughters were staying with friends who had plenty of room for them. This same parent also tried to get me to say there was something wrong with one of her children so she could get SSI. There was nothing wrong with the child and that is what I wrote on the paper she gave me to fill out. </p>

		<p>I can quite believe the behaviour.  Prior to the ANC taking over in South Africa the black population was told by ANC officials, that the bank key cards used by just about every white family, was in fact given to them by the government so that they could have free money. <br>
Not only that lie, but that all the white peoples houses would be given to the black population after they voted for the ANC.<br>
Blacks actually believed all these lies.  I know because our black maid told me about the stories that were spread around.</p>
<p>So those in Detroit are not alone in disillusion.  The problem is that they do not have the sense to see thru it all.</p>

		<p>No cloud is without at least a slim silver lining; or as those flamboyantly ignorant black women of leisure in that sound clip from WJR might put it, an &ldquo;Obama money&rdquo; lining!</p>
<p>Comrade BO and the intellectually nebulous ghetto dwellers who make up his powerbase, had better enjoy their stick it to whitey &ldquo;stash&rdquo; now, because that spigot is starting to run dry, along with our economy. Leftists in general and blacks in particular, have no concept that money isn&rsquo;t something that falls from the sky or simply materializes in a magic cash register; for money to be worth something, there has to be something of value backing it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Comrade BO who is both a Red and black, now has his hands on the &ldquo;enchanted&rdquo; printing presses at the US Treasury and is attempting to prove that two negatives don&rsquo;t always make a positive. Or put another way, with unemployment currently at 9.8% and our money becoming toilet paper, the road to a Marxist/Multi-Cult utopia (Obatopia) is not going to be achieved. </p>
<p>How surprising!</p>
<p>Remember, the basic foundation of  Marxist/Multi-Cultism&rsquo;s economics is that the &ldquo;exploiting&rdquo; white working and middle classes, are just comfortable enough and also just beguiled enough to accept that their &ldquo;redistributive&rdquo; enslavement is really an egalitarian step toward a lasting &ldquo;peace&rdquo; or even &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; with the &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; nonwhite vultures and hyenas. When that foundation fractures, or even better evaporates, things will become very interesting, very interesting indeed.   </p>
<p>Enough said!<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, absolutely NOTHING, that speaks better for the perceived Black mentality than the reality that Blacks and Whites started on a level playing field 50,000 years ago. That Whites in Europe started civilization on its upward course. Those brilliant Greek philosophers, thinkers mathematicians who started the quest for knowledge and learning. Those Roman engineers who made such hefty contributions to engineering and construction.</p>
<p>Then after the Renaissance swept Europe along, with so many experimenters, thinkers, etc. adding to knowledge over the subsequent centuries.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution, which was the driving force making today&rsquo;s benefits possible&hellip; The Industrial Revolusion did not start in Bangladesh, India, China, Korea or Japan. Most assuredly nothing even remotely like it took place in Africa. That ludicrous spin on history by our liberals not withstanding&hellip; it started around the beginning of the 18th Century&hellip; in ENGLAND! Spreading from there all over Europe and to America. While African Blacks barely advanced above their Stone Age level but for the help of Whites.</p>
<p>The inner-city Blacks typified in the article&hellip; can they really be thought of as advanced very far over their modern African counterparts? Reveling in mindless destruction, crime rampant among Blacks of all ages.</p>

		<p>That sounds good in theory there anonymous. But let&rsquo;s take away your job and give you deformed hands you can&rsquo;t use so you lose your ability to earn as well and put you in your car. Now you&rsquo;ll just starve to death in the car I suppose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing the point. Social welfare is for the truly needy disabled citizen. It was never intended to be the means for poor healthy third world immigrants to populate the country with gangsters.  </p>
