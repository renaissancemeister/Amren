<h1>Gangs Flee N.Va. for Havens in Md., D.C., Report Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Freeman Klopott, Washington Examiner, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Crackdowns on illegal immigrants and other law enforcement efforts are driving gangs out of Northern Virginia and into Maryland and the District, a report released Monday concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many gang members from Northern Virginia are moving or driving to Prince George&rsquo;s and other Maryland counties, into the District of Columbia or further south and west into Virginia to avoid dealing with police departments that are unrelenting in their efforts to keep gangs under control,&#8221; authorities wrote in the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force report.</p>
<p>The report said the task force&rsquo;s success is the result of Virginia law enforcement&rsquo;s use of anti-gang policing measures, including the referring of suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities. Since the task force was created in 2003, it has arrested 952 gang members, more than 40 percent of whom were illegal immigrants, the report said.</p>
<p>Experts say jurisdictions such as Montgomery County, where police are told to look away from immigration violations, have become safe havens for gangs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But officials on the other side of the Potomac said there is no evidence to back up the report&rsquo;s claim  &mdash;  based on anecdotal evidence  &mdash;  that the gangs are fleeing into their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prince George&rsquo;s County State&rsquo;s Attorney Glenn Ivey said violent crime has been dropping in the county, where homicides this year may reach lows not seen since the late 1990s. Violent activity by Hispanic gangs has dropped off since federal authorities successfully prosecuted MS-13 gang leaders on racketeering charges. However, Ivey said, traditionally black gangs like the Crips and the Bloods have been making inroads, but primarily through the jail system and not through migration from other areas.</p>
<p>Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, said the &#8220;enforcement-free zones&#8221; that define Maryland&rsquo;s and the District&rsquo;s approach to illegal immigrants &#8220;benefit only the lawbreaker and are a threat to public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;a jurisdiction which welcomes illegal immigration also welcomes gang activity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.  It&rsquo;s too late to clean the country up to the point where it was in just the year 1988, when it began to crumble via the &#8220;Kinder-gentler-nation&#8221; Bush, then break apart in a serious way with the leftist fool from Arkansas in 1992.  </p>
<p>Of course, if W hadn&rsquo;t been elected there would have been no war, no push for legalizing criminal aliens, and the Republicans wouldn&rsquo;t have lost complete control of both houses in such a big way, which opened the door for this pro-black Maoist to get elected.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the revolutionaries, radicals and black militants in Obama&rsquo;s administration are set to cause FAR more mischief than Jimmy Carter ever thought about.  </p>
<p>Johnson, Carter, Clinton, Obama.  Each one was successively worse, and each one brought the country much closer to a totalitarian state, with the latest fool set to cause the country to erupt into civil war.</p>
<p>This nation is the victim of a two headed, one party system that is concerned only about getting into power for their own brand of thuggery.  Nobody runs for office unless their respective back room political machines designate them to do so.  The result, of course, is that the best and brightest are outside the system, so therefore, the system is too corrupt to offer effective candidates, and we are consistently forced to vote for whoever will take us on the slowest road to hell.  The bottom line here is that we have a dysfunctional country and that won&rsquo;t change until it splits apart into small enclaves.</p>
<p>So, if there are gangs in certain parts of the country and they&rsquo;re getting worse, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter in the overall scheme of things, because we&rsquo;ve gone far beyond the point where corrections will save the day and improve the country.  It&rsquo;s too late for that.</p>

		<p>If there could ever be such a thing as an accurate poll,I would like to see a national poll as to who in this country thinks as the first commentator does that it is too late for this country. I agree as he does. Jim</p>

		<p> A couple of weeks ago I was returning from Manhattan to Queens via the subway.  I was born and raised in the midwest so I&rsquo;m not really skilled at handling those underground mazes known as public transprotation.  </p>
<p>   Anyway, the complexions of the people on the trains changes as you pass through different neighborhoods and people get on and off.  I got lost and went on the wrong train.  I wound up at a station in deepest, darkest Brooklyn and was told by the attendant I had to go out on the street, cross to the other side and enter the station across from there to get back to catch another subway line.  </p>
<p>   When I emerged (at 9pm) on the street, it was like downtown Nairobi.  I was the only ONLY person like me there.  The gang thugs and hoochie mommas were EVERYWHERE in huge mobs walking all around like it was some post apacalyptic vision of tribal chaos.  </p>
<p>   The many, many Thugs all around were looking at me with absolute predator stares.  It was unmistakable.  The hoochie mommas looked at me in disbelief as if to say, &#8220;What is one of those doing here?&#8221;  I have never in my life felt so unsafe as at that moment.  I&rsquo;m a big guy, trained in martial arts - how can I emphasize enough that statement of feeling actually fearful for my life?  </p>
<p>   Anyway, I booked over to the other station entrance and went underground.  More thugs there, staring at me, as I waited for the train.  Some started moving closer to me, in that shuffling sort of way.  When the train came a few moments later I was so relieved, and in about 20 minutes the complexion changed and the thugs receeded.  </p>
<p>   I moved to this city for the jobs, and live in a mixed (though no one from THAT group) neighborhood.  My wife and I have an understanding that if our neighborhood ever gets that kind of mixing we&rsquo;re outta there.  There are a few subsidized FOLKS a few blocks away, but so far housing prices have keept them at bay.  Thank God for the Asians who are willing to pay top dollar for property - it keeps the housing prices out of reach in many areas of NYC.  In fifty years, where can our descendants find safety?</p>
