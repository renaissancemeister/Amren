<h1>Griese Suspended 1 Game for Montoya Remark</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox Sports, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ESPN broadcaster Bob Griese has been suspended one week for a remark he made about NASCAR driver Juan Pablo Montoya.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Krulewitz says ESPN has spoken to Griese and &#8220;he understands the comment was inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>During ESPN&rsquo;s broadcast of the Minnesota-Ohio State game Saturday, a graphic was shown listing the top five drivers in NASCAR&rsquo;s points race. Fellow analyst Chris Spielman asked where was Montoya, who is Colombian.</p>
<p>Griese replied he was &#8220;out having a taco.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Griese replied he was &ldquo;out having a taco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, so what?  Who cares?  Besides, Tacos are Mexican food, not Columbian.</p>
<p>I wonder.  If this guy was Irish and Griese said he was out having corned beef and cabbage, would the PC&rsquo;ers have gotten their bowels in an uproar?  Or if this guy was Italian and Griese said he was out eating spaghetti and meatballs, would the Pc&rsquo;ers object to that, too?</p>
<p>This is beyond bizarre.  This is absolutely ludicrous.</p>

		<p>While Montoya himself, didn&rsquo;t make a big issue about it, Griese was ignorant in that maybe he didn&rsquo;t know Juan Pablo Montoya is from Colombia- not Mexico. So the taco reference doesn&rsquo;t apply to Montoya.</p>
<p>ESPN seems to get their panties in a twist lately. First, one of their female reporters is secretly videotaped, then they fire Steve Phillips because he had an affair with a co-worker, now this.</p>

		<p>It probably was offensive but not for the reason they think. ESPN probably thinks it was offensive because it was a white guy saying it about a Hispanic guy.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, tacos are a Mexican food. I know some about Central and South American cultures and one thing is for sure: they DO NOT like being mistaken for Mexicans because they view Mexicans much the same way white Americans view Mexicans (mestizos, not white Spanish Mexicans).</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s so wrong with that comment? Would it be offensive if he said &#8216;out having a beer&rsquo;, or &#8216;out having a smoke&rsquo;. I mean seriously! </p>
<p>When told a comment is &#8220;racist&#8221;, one should immediately get offended at the accuser and demand they explain why it&rsquo;s racist. And one should not allow the accuser to separate themselves from the supposedly offended group by stating &#8220;some might find that offensive&#8221;. Force the accuser to state why, and then immediately accuse the accuser of racism for telling you that a taco is a Hispanic food, and you noticed the persons race when making your comment. Respond by stating that the fact that the accuser noticed the race of the subject, and the origin of the food, in turn makes the accuser a racist. And therefor, the accuser needs to apologize to you for using their racism to attack your sensibilities.</p>
<p>It all boils down to getting the person to define racism, and immediately showing that the accuser themselves fall under their own definition of what&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>

		<p>If the driver had been British&hellip;The white old fashioned kind&hellip; and the commentator said he was out having fish and chips.. or if he were a southerner and it went &hellip;out having chicken and biscuits I don&rsquo;t think it would have been anything but if it were a black and fried chicken came up or Mexican and taco &hellip; its different because these latter groups are not traditionally as welcomed into this nation. Its a double standard perhaps with a minor justification but I think the suspension is pure overkill. How many times have German accents been expressions of devient heartlesness in the media without any censorship?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a nasty stereotype that Colombians or that any Latin Americans eat Taco&rsquo;s perpetuated by the White man to &#8216;keep them down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In actuality, it is well documented that duck a l&rsquo;orange is the preferred dish for those who originate from south of the border.</p>
<p>In the time of political correctness the first thing to go is our senses of humor.<br>
In my opinion, the best jokes are the ones where the teller has to look around 360 degrees before telling.<br>
Who here has heard of a recent &#8216;good joke&rsquo; that starts along the lines of &#8220;a Pollack and Irishman and a Russian walk into a bar&hellip;&#8221;<br>
They just don&rsquo;t make them anymore.</p>

		<p>Our once civil society is sinking into utter nonsense.  I suppose if fellow Purdue alumni Bob Griese was said to be out having a hamburger, then the individual commenting would be upbraided for insensitivity to Caucasians?  This has become so ridiculous that the only reasonable response is &lsquo;Get a life, Olbermann Junior&rsquo;.</p>

How preposterous. Would Mr Griese have been suspended for
saying that Jeff Gordon was out having a cheeseburger? I
think not. Mr. Griese should have told ESPN that he stands
by his comment and that if they suspend him or fire him that
he would see them in court.

		<p>I agree that this statement was inappropriate because it was an ignorant statement. Columbians aren&rsquo;t Mexicans. It would be just as inappropriate and ignorant if the driver was Chinese and he said he was &#8220;out eating sushi&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t agree with the suspension but if you are going to make jokes about other people&rsquo;s cultures, it help it you at least get the culture right.</p>

		<p>The double standard is alive and well.  Whites cannot even make a  joke without being punished. The same is not true of other races. <br>
White people need to start thinking of themselves as a disadvantaged class, after all, the feds classify them as &#8220;Non-Hispanic white&#8221;.  How many examples of racism in the form of organized groups such as NAACP, LA RAZA and so forth do we need before we wake up.  Our children and grandchildren will have less  opportunity because we have no  organized effectively to sue for our rights. We must adoptthe methods of the other races to organize,  agitate,  and threaten to sue every time a white person is denied  opportunity.  The civil rights  laws should work in white&rsquo;s favor, also.<br>
Krulewitz and ESPN suck!</p>
