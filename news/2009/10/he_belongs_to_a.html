	<p>Residents of Kenya want Barack Obama to return to their country and to rule over them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need an Obama here in Africa,&#8221; grumbled Humphrey Oguto, a 27-year-old engineer. &#8220;He&rsquo;s done a lot in just a little time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our leaders have done nothing for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Photographs of the US President are omnipresent in huts, shantys, marketplaces, and businesses throughout the country. His image has also been plastered on buses and minibuses, known as matatus, in Nairobi, Mombassa, and other cities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Most Kenyans believe that Mr. Obama was born in their country and has more in common with them than with the American people.</p>
<p>Obamamania in this Third World African country reached fever pitch when the Norwegian Nobel Committee&rsquo;s awarded their Peace Prize to the fledgling U. S. President for &#8220;his initiatives to reduce nuclear arms and defuse tensions through diplomacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I heard it [the announcement of the award] on the radio I said &#8216;Hallelujah!&rsquo;&#8221; says 65-year-old James Andaro. &#8220;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s blessing, this win is for Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Kenyan city of Kisumu, the capital of the home province of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s father, radio shows interrupted broadcasting to have live phone-ins so callers could congratulate the president on his win. Many callers claimed that the President had been born in their city of 273,400 people and not Honoloulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki issued this statement of congratulations to the U.S. leader for capturing the Nobel Prize: &#8220;I have no doubt that this award will give new impetus to your efforts to bring about lasting peace in areas where war has ravaged communities over long periods of time. I also encourage you to continue opening the avenues of dialogue in order to bring about a better understanding among the family of nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has not visited his Kenya since his inauguration amid concerns over poor governance in the African country. More than 1,000 people were killed in riots that followed Mr. Kibaki&rsquo;s narrow re-election in 2007. Observers described the polls as deeply flawed.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20091009/AF.Kenya.Obama.Prize/">Kenyan Grandmother Is Happy for Obama</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Tom Maliti, Comcast News, October 10, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Sitting on a plastic chair outside her compound in the quite village of Kogelo, Sarah Obama told The Associate Press she believes her step-grandson&rsquo;s surprise win is a gift from God.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The announcement was met with joy in Kenya, which has a special regard for Obama, the son of a Kenyan economist and an American anthropologist.</p>
<p>Radio shows interrupted their programming Friday, and traders in the market huddled around hand-held radios and touts yelled the news to each other from the windows of local minibuses known as matatus. Many are already decorated with Obama&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarah Obama said she learned of the award from Auma Obama, one of the president&rsquo;s Kenyan stepsisters, who called from the United States.</p>
<p>She defended the president from those who say he has received the prize too early, saying it &#8220;is God-given, whether it is too early or not. But if you deserve an award you get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;King of Kenya&rsquo; for the native also sounds better to me than  President of USA. Is there a charity for a contribution for the one way ticket and a second peace prize ?  </p>

		<p>I still haven&rsquo;t seen anything resembling a real birth certificate.  Just some easily printed, on any printer, piece of paper stating he was born in this country.  With the amount of secrecy regarding his past I am seeing more in common with Joseph Stalin and Kim Jong than any American leader.</p>

		<p>If Kenyans think obama has acomplished a lot they obviously do not understand what acomplishment realy is! They do know the truth about one thing though, they know he was born in Kenya. It truley would be wonderfull if they did woo him to the point where he went back to his people and left the us alone.</p>

		<p>We wish to assure these Kenyans that an equal number of Americans<br>
have the same hopes. Kenya is downright perfect for Obama, they thrive on Chicago-style politics, no other style is known there.<br>
Whilst most Kenyans survive on a dollar a day, their parliamentarians are amongst the highest paid in the world - 100% tax free. Then there are those lovely allowances. A basic $5,000 a month car allowance, for the first 300 km plus $1.60 a km thereafter. I work 6 days a week, were I to get that sort of allowance, I could stop working, just drive to work and back for $90,000 p.a. That is $ 5.75 a mile. The working hours should appeal to him as well, in the last year they clocked in 51 days.</p>

		<p>Why not? I think Obama should resign the U.S. Presidency, renounce his American citizenship and move to Kenya. There, he would find willing subjects eager to annoint him as their messiah, even more so than in this country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather take my chances with Biden. He can be more easily controlled by public opinion, and has already shown himself to be a &#8220;booster&#8221; of other pols&rsquo; speeches. He won&rsquo;t get anything done. </p>

		<p> I take it that the photo at the top of the original story is of Obama&rsquo;s grandparents. Good family resemblance there. Yes, if the Mulatto Messiah would like to be crowned king of Kenya, there are many of us Americans who would be glad to buy him, the missus and the two little ones one-way plane tickets over there.</p>
<p> We might even pass the hat to buy him a crown to wear, when he gets there. Or did the Nobel Peace Prize include one of those?</p>

You mean they have engineers in Africa!!! How can one tell! I guess over there any black man with a screwdriver is an &#8220;engineer&#8221;, just like drinking Tang would make them an astronaut. Anyway- - the comments by these illiterate Africans just proves why they will forever be stuck in the stone age. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of this.  Send Obama and all his radical appointees to rule over Africa.  (He won&rsquo;t be any worse than the thugs they have now.)  Just make sure he gives up his U.S. citizenship and promises never to come back.  As a bonus, let them have Nancy Pelosi too.</p>

		<p>Obama to go to Kenya, to become their king? Certainly the BEST idea submitted in a long time. This would be a real WIN-WIN for Americans and Kenyans. We&rsquo;d be rid of him and the Kenyans can worship him as their demi-god.</p>

		<p>Re-reading this, I realize I left out the most salient point. They want him to rule over them. This is the African mentality that has prevented any form of democracy taking hold on the continent. They do not want to elect him, things are not done that way over there.They cannot see any form of government without a strongman in charge, they know only to well that most elections there are a farce. </p>

What an excellent idea!  I hope he accepts their generous invitation.</p>
<p>Btw,  that word <i>&#8220;return&#8221;  </i>strikes me as interesting.  Return there?  Does that imply that he really was born there, after all?  Do they know something that we don&rsquo;t?</p>

<p><br>
They want him to &#8220;return&#8221; to Africa to rule over them?  What a fascinating concept! <br>
 <br>
But, aside from its momentary allure, I have to wonder what would replace him?  Probably just more of the same. </p>
<p>Surely his handlers have a spare, an extra, waiting somewhere in the wings.</p>
