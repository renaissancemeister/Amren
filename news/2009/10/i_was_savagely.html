			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicky Murfitt, Daily Mail (London), October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With painful honesty, Katie Piper, the former TV presenter tells why she has finally waived her right to anonymity  &mdash;  and reveals the awful events that changed her life for ever</p>
<p>However much she would like to forget them, the details of how she lost her dreams, her identity and very nearly her life will stay with Katie Piper for ever.</p>
<p>They are burned into both her memory and her face. Katie, 26, has remained fearful and anonymous in the 18 months since the man she met on the internet attempted to destroy her, so few will recognise her name.</p>
<p>Moving on: Katie Piper is learning to live with her rebuilt features and is exhausted by more than 30 operations following the acid attack by her former boyfriend</p>
<p>But the facts of the case  &mdash;  the rape, the vengeful boyfriend Daniel Lynch, the cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid  &mdash;  are all too familiar, a cause of anger and revulsion when they were revealed in court earlier this year.</p>
<p>It was an added cruelty that Katie&rsquo;s world had revolved around her beauty. She modelled for catalogues and magazines, presented television programmes and had dreamed of a full-time career in the media.</p>
<p>But on March 31, 2008, the old Katie Piper disappeared for ever. The acid, hurled into her face on a busy London street, disfigured her beyond recognition. Some slipped down her throat with further terrible consequences.</p>
<p>&#8216;I could hear someone screaming and screaming and kept wishing they&rsquo;d be quiet. Then I realised it was me,&rsquo; she recalls.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was standing in the street with people walking past me and I could feel my face evaporating. I thought I was on fire as the acid ate at my skin.</p>
<p>&#8216;In one of Danny&rsquo;s calls he&rsquo;d told me he&rsquo;d got a present for me that would change my life for ever. I knew instantly that he was behind it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, able to communicate only in writing, she gave her parents a note that said: &#8216;Kill me.&rsquo; Yet today, Katie is no longer in despair.</p>
<p>Still learning to live with her rebuilt features and exhausted by more than 30 operations, she has agreed to waive her anonymity and speak in public. Her fightback will be featured in a Channel 4 documentary this month.</p>
<p>She hopes her bravery will help her regain some confidence. It is also a chance to insist  &mdash;  as she has discovered in the hardest way  &mdash;  that appearance cannot be the measure of human worth.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m never going to be the old Katie. She&rsquo;s like a best friend I once had,&rsquo; she admits.</p>
<p>&#8216;She&rsquo;s gone and there&rsquo;s a different one in her place. I&rsquo;m not going to be a victim. I&rsquo;m the woman who got through this. I&rsquo;m full of life and looking forward to the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, Katie was living in London for the first time and enjoying it. She was popular, particularly with men who were drawn to her blonde good looks and petite figure.</p>
<p>Like many young adults, she lived part of her hectic life through the pages of Facebook and it was not unusual for her to receive 80 emails in one day, many from admiring strangers.</p>
<p>Mostly, these were ignored. But when 33-year-old Daniel Lynch, a martial arts enthusiast, emailed Katie to say he&rsquo;d been following her career, she admits she was instantly attracted.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was wearing a martial arts suit in his picture and I&rsquo;d been doing some promotional work for martial arts in the UK,&rsquo; she explains.</p>
<p>&#8216;We seemed to have a lot in common and, to be honest, looking at his picture, I fancied him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few days later Lynch turned up at a promotional event in Reading where Katie was working.</p>
<p>&#8216;He seemed quite shy and nervous when we first met,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;We just had a nice, normal chat. He was 6ft 4in, quite macho-looking and handsome. I liked what I saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Katie sent him her phone number and when they went on their first date, he met her with flowers and a teddy bear.</p>
<p>&#8216;We liked each other and we had fun,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;He told me on our second date that he loved me. His arm was always around me and even when we were in the car and stopped at traffic lights, he would turn and kiss me.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was attentive and showered me with affection. He rang me and emailed me constantly. At one point he&rsquo;d sent so many messages he blocked my Facebook account. If I&rsquo;m honest, I was flattered  &mdash;  at least at first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She soon got a very different view of her new boyfriend, though. Angered by a trivial slight when he was buying trainers, Lynch had exploded at a shop assistant, leaving Katie to pick up the pieces. This was at the end of March last year.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were two weeks into our relationship and I&rsquo;d started feeling stifled by his constant calls and emails. I didn&rsquo;t say anything but I planned to break up with him,&rsquo; she says.</p>
<p>If she had known his true background, she would never have been with him in the first place. Lynch, who lived in Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, West London, with his mother and brother, had convictions for violence and had served a jail sentence for throwing boiling water into the face of another man. But Katie knew none of this.</p>
<p>&#8216;Later on the day of the incident in the shop, when he suggested we make a night of it and stay in a hotel in Bayswater, I agreed,&rsquo; she says.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was a Thursday and I had an appointment in town the next day. We went for a meal, shared a bottle of wine and he seemed to be in a good mood again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What happened next was terrifying by anyone&rsquo;s standards. To a young girl from a comfortable home in a South of England market town, it was unimaginable. Lynch raped her in the hotel room before holding her captive for eight hellish hours.</p>
<p>He smashed her head, beat her, threatened to slash her face with a razor and said he would hang her with a belt. Later he claimed to have been high on steroids.</p>
<p>Even now, the details of the rape are hard for Katie to recount. &#8216;One minute he&rsquo;d tell me he loved me and the next he was shouting and swearing. His face was so contorted and I knew that I was dealing with a very sick person,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;I didn&rsquo;t think he was going to let me leave that room alive.</p>
<p>&#8216;The blood from my head wound was everywhere  &mdash;  on the bed, on the carpets, on the bathroom tiles. I told him the maids would be along soon and we had to clear up, otherwise they&rsquo;d call the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They drove back to Katie&rsquo;s flat in Golders Green where, to her relief, he agreed to let her out of the car. It was 5pm on Friday.</p>
<p>If her brief affair with Lynch was a dreadful mistake, Katie&rsquo;s next decision, too, might seem open to question. She decided not to go to the police, gripped by the fear that he would kill her if she put one foot wrong. Nor did she tell the truth to the doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, where her head wound was glued.</p>
<p>&#8216;I hated myself and what had happened to me,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;But I was terrified that he would hurt me or someone I loved. I kept thinking that as long as I played along and didn&rsquo;t make him angry, he&rsquo;d get fed up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead, the bombardment of phone calls continued. Lynch was full of apologies, she says, and the following Monday morning begged her to read an email he had written.</p>
<p>So, with her own internet line down, she agreed to leave her flat and walk to an internet cafe.</p>
<p>Katie admits: &#8216;I was nervous about leaving the flat but thought that I could end this thing if I read the email. The whole time Danny was on the phone to me, making conversation, asking me what I was wearing. I was exhausted so I told him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was how her assailant, directed by Lynch, picked her out.</p>
<p>&#8216;I saw a man in a hooded top walking towards me,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;He was carrying a cup. I assumed he was a beggar so I reached into my bag for some change. He came up close, like he was going to speak, and threw liquid from the cup at my face.</p>
<p>&#8216;The pain was indescribable, but for a split second I remember thinking, &#8220;How rude to throw coffee when I was trying to help him.&#8221; I could feel my skin and clothes burning off me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shocking attack can be seen on CCTV as Katie Piper (on the right), is attacked in broad daylight</p>
<p>The shocking attack can be seen on CCTV as Katie Piper (on the right), is attacked in broad daylight</p>
<p>Losing her vision and disorientated, Katie staggered across Golders Green High Road, dodging in and out of cars to get help. &#8216;I remember my Ugg boots slipped off and I just left them in the middle of the road,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;I could so easily have been knocked down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To make things worse, Katie had to wait more than an hour in agony before ambulance crews were given the all-clear to treat her, because they didn&rsquo;t know what the substance was and whether there was a risk of her attacker being nearby.</p>
<p>Chillingly, she confides: &#8216;They zipped me up in a protective suit and I thought it must be a body bag and that I was dead and looking in on the scene around me. All I could hear were voices and I figured I must be in Heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>David Piper, who runs a business, and his wife Diane took one look at their once beautiful daughter in hospital and silently believed she&rsquo;d be better off dead, as Diane now admits. On one side, Katie&rsquo;s face had been destroyed as far as the fat layer  &mdash;  the only thing beyond it was bone.</p>
<p>She had lost the sight in her left eye and, because of the damage to her oesophagus, was unable to eat.</p>
<p>&#8216;I couldn&rsquo;t see a way back for her,&rsquo; says Diane. &#8216;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what sort of future she&rsquo;d have. Everything she&rsquo;d hoped for and dreamed of depended on her face and it was gone. The thing that upset me most was when she wrote, &#8220;Kill me.&#8221; &#8216;</p>
<p>So serious were the injuries that Katie&rsquo;s surgeon at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Mohammad Ali Jawad, resorted to pioneering techniques. In a single operation, the first of its kind ever to be performed, he removed Katie&rsquo;s entire face, used a skin substitute, Matriderm (which provides a &#8216;scaffolding&rsquo; for grafts), to rebuild its foundations, then grafted skin from her lower back and buttocks on to her face.</p>
<p>After the operation, she was put into an induced coma for 12 days and kept in intensive care. Her weight plummeted to six stone and she had to be fed via a tube in her stomach.</p>
<p>Katie was given police protection even though Lynch and Stefan Sylvestre, now 21 and who threw the acid, had been arrested.</p>
<p>Her determination to recover astonished doctors but it was seven weeks before she knew and saw for herself the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>&#8216;When I held the mirror up I thought someone had given me a broken one or put a silly face on it as a joke,&rsquo; she admits.</p>
<p>&#8216;I knew that they&rsquo;d taken my face away and that it was put somewhere in a bin in the hospital, but in my head I assumed I&rsquo;d look like the old Katie, just with a few red blotches.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was so embarrassed that people had seen me like this. I wanted to tear the whole thing off and make it go away. There was nothing about me that I recognised. My identity as I knew it had gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Diane gave up her job as a classroom assistant in a primary school to look after her daughter full-time. As well as regular massage at home to keep her damaged skin supple, Katie attends a clinic in southern France that specialises in treating burn-damaged skin.</p>
<p>Eating remains a struggle. Just last week she had another operation to dilate her oesophagus because, every few weeks, scar tissue reforms, narrowing the passage to just a centimetre wide.</p>
<p>It is a measure of her progress that, a few hours later, she sat through a whole meal with her family to celebrate her 26th birthday. &#8216;I&rsquo;m usually sick several times throughout a meal and prefer to eat alone,&rsquo; she explains.</p>
<p>&#8216;To sit down with my family and friends, eat chicken and have a couple of glasses of wine was such a thrill that I felt I really had something to celebrate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The psychological damage has been enormous and it has taken months for Katie to go outside. She keeps all doors and windows locked, is terrified by unexpected callers and is frightened to make hot drinks because of the memories it revives. For months she couldn&rsquo;t bear to have a shower because of the feeling of liquid moving across her body.</p>
<p>At night she has to wear a balaclava-style mask and a body suit to try to stretch her burned skin and during the day she wears a clear, plastic mask. Pam Warren, who had been terribly burned in the Paddington rail crash and also wore a mask, came to see Katie to advise her.</p>
<p>In May, at Wood Green Crown Court, North London, Lynch and his accomplice Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were &#8216;the face of pure evil&rsquo;. Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years.</p>
<p>But Katie still has nightmares and fears Lynch&rsquo;s release. When he obtained a phone illegally in jail he used it to post a message on the internet saying how much he missed her. She has now closed all of her social networking accounts.</p>
<p>Katie sounds remarkably well-adjusted despite what she has been through, and is full of praise for her treatment. In particular, she says that the specialist rehabilitation she received should be standard for burns victims.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was fortunate to have a good surgeon and together with the correct aftercare I&rsquo;ve achieved results that exceeded even my expectations,&rsquo; she says. &#8216;Although, yes, I&rsquo;ve been scarred for life, I am extremely happy with my new beautiful face.</p>
<p>&#8216;There were times when I was so depressed I wanted to hide from the world. Facing people looking like I do has been a huge ordeal for someone who lived her life to look beautiful. My family have been amazing and without their support and the support of Mr Jawad, I would never have got through this.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now, though, I realise my life before was so superficial. I used to refuse to go out if I had a spot on my face. Now I wish a spot was all I had to worry about. There are people who point and stare. One man even knocked my sun hat off and laughed at me. Those times hurt, but I won&rsquo;t let them get me down. I&rsquo;d like to be able to have a husband and family one day. I can&rsquo;t live a life of regret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And what of Lynch? &#8216;Danny was sick. He may have taken away what was once important to me but, cheesy as it sounds, I am a better person for it. And he couldn&rsquo;t take away my spirit. I love my life and I know that I have a future now, and it&rsquo;s a wonderful feeling.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I salute her courage in rebuilding her life.  </p>
<p>It is pathetic that the ambulance took an hour to attend to her because the emergency crew feared the attacker might be nearby.  WHERE WERE THE POLICE?  The police should have escorted the ambulance in that situation.  It shows the fear Londoners now live in.</p>
<p>After he beat her and split her head open, she said she told him the maids would be along soon and we had to clear up the blood, otherwise they&rsquo;d call the police.  The is a sad case of a victim living in fear and helping her abuser out of fear.  She couldn&rsquo;t go to the police because she feared retaliation from him.  The ambulance could not attend to her because they feared him, also.  </p>

		<p>When she saw his photo, she fancied him&hellip;she thought he was macho-looking and handsome&hellip;sorry I fail to see that at all by looking at his photo..In fact just the opposite. Her message should be that dating blacks can be dangerous to one&rsquo;s health and looks. But of course that message will never be sent to these young White impressionable girls. Too bad she doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to come out and say it or else she hasn&rsquo;t figured that out yet.</p>
<p>If she had stayed with White men this would have never happened, but with blacks this is an occurence that happens with regularity. Violence seems to be in their genes. We see it everyday of the week here and all over the world where they reside.</p>

		<p>What a horrific story! I know that there are some out there that would blame the girl for dating a black guy but before you do that think about what kids are taught in school these days about &#8220;racism&#8221;. Girls are often harassed by black men who will call her &#8220;racist&#8221; or a &#8220;hater&#8221; if she refuses his sexual advances or requests for a date. Unfortunately many of these girls are not taught properly at home about interracial dating, my grandparents told me that if I ever came home with a black guy then that was it, I was not welcome at home anymore. </p>

		<p>Although I feel some sadness for her, she only has herself to blame for this, and her parents.<br>
I really flipped when she said - &#8220;His arm was always around me and even when we were in the car and stopped at traffic lights, he would turn and kiss me.&#8221; Look, the ONLY reason he always had his arm around her and kissed her at traffic lights is that White people were looking and he had to make sure they knew that she was HIS, and that was just his way to rub it in their faces. <br>

<p>Race is a pretty reliable proxy for a black man&rsquo;s &#8216;true background.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Katie Piper is a perfect Poster Child for white women to not become involved with  blacks.Her submissiveness and trust is what caused her tragedy.  White submissivness and trust is as much to blame as black treachery.  A violent black husband who was formerly married to a white woman poured a flammable liquid on her, himself, and their two children inside their vehicle, killing the two children and severely disfiguring her and him,long AFTER he had repeatedly brutalized her.  This happened in Contra Costa County, Ca.   She appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show.  The jury spared him the death penalty.   It was the blacks on the jury who wouldnt give it to him.  She should spend the rest of her life warning white women about black  thugs.</p>

		<p>Reading this article made my blood boil first of all because as a white, single and fairly attractive male I haven&rsquo;t been able to find a white woman we both could fall in love with, while at the same time I notice that a lot of rude and repulsive non-whites like the perpetrator of the attack on Katie seem to exert an inapprehensible force of attraction on apparently the most beautiful young white females. I don&rsquo;t know what is wrong with our white girls today. I must admit that I have never been so afraid of them as now. If they and white males don&rsquo;t find each other in love and get kids, our civilization will be destroyed forever, but I don&rsquo;t know what can be done. I also notice that males are rather interested in indulging their hobbies (such as computer games and cars) rather than looking for a relationship and loving the girlfriend/wife.</p>
<p>Second, I ask myself what about the parents of whites who are victims of non-whites&rsquo; violence. We have such victims all over the white world every day, yet it seems to me that their parents don&rsquo;t draw the proper conclusions. If they did, the world would have been enriched by thousands of additional Nick Griffins, Le Pens or Geert Wilders long ago. If - god forbid - my children became victims of non-whites&rsquo; violence, I would use all my available powers to climb up to the societal and political arena in order to acquire some chance to cause change by voicing my concerns about non-white massive immigration and challenging the society on this subject. I would not fear to be called racist, there wouldn&rsquo;t be more to lose for me, I would sacrifice my life if necessary - all good parents should have this attitude, yet we seldom see individuals who have become noticeable figures in pro-white parties driven by their despair. If the parents of victims were sane, we&rsquo;d expect at least tens of thousands of them attending the next Amren conference as a first step. If their children becoming victims of non-white immigration is not incentive enough to join us and fight for our cause, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>The biggest culprits in this case are the people who run the media. In other words, the people this woman worked for. They and their cohorts in academia keep the propaganda up 24/7 when it comes to making whites think they must date non-whites to show that they aren&rsquo;t racist as mentioned above by Spartan 24. They especially work hard on young white girls. Many girls who still have their instincts intact and have no desire to date a non-white are still scared to tell the non-whites &#8220;no&#8221; because the girls are afraid of being called &#8220;racist&#8221;, don&rsquo;t want to appear racist, and somewhere in the back of their minds know that a spurned non-white has a good chance of beating them senseless or worse - and getting away with it - if turned down for a date or anything else.

		<p>My wife told me that when her older sister was in high school, she dated an African-American kid. When her single-parent mother found out, she was furious and told both her daughters in no uncertain terms that blacks were DANGEROUS and there would be severe consequences for any more dating attempts.</p>
<p>When my two oldest daughters began to date, my wife and I echoed the same message to them. </p>
<p>I remember that evening I came home and saw Tyrone sitting in my living room next to my oldest daughter. My daughter said they were not dating and only friends. After Tyrone left, my wife and I repeated the message to which my daughter said that her counselor at high school said we were racists and there was nothing wrong with black and whites mixing on dates.</p>
<p>Going from that point, I did what was necessary to protect my loved one. At the next encouter, I offered to give Tyrone a ride home since he did not have a car and was riding the bus.  I smiled as I made the offer. When I got to Tyrone&rsquo;s home, a decent looking brick house in a reasonable neighborhood, I made it crystal clear to him that he was never to approach my daughter again and that there would be extreme consequences if he were to disobey a concerned father&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>There were no further encounters and no further issues.</p>

		<p><b>The biggest culprits in this case are the people who run the media. In other words, the people this woman worked for.

<p>I am a white male and have worked with young pretty white females that have told me this.  I say, &#8220;You&rsquo;re not obligated to date anyone nor give a reason why you don&rsquo;t want to date someone.&#8221;   I&rsquo;ve lucky woke up some to not get scared of being called a &#8220;racist&#8221;, merely because racial tribalism is a natural instinct for all people, and that they throw the word &#8220;racist&#8221; around as psychological bully.</p>

		<p>A high school counselor telling a child that her parents are &#8220;racists&#8221; for not allowing her to date or associate with blacks is just another reason to home school your kids. When everyone is against you with what you teach your children then it is better to just have them at home. I do not want my daughter to be another statistic, as there are so many girls who end up maimed or murdered because they dated or worse married a black man. In my hometown there was recently another incident like this, unfortunately the girl (who attended an exclusive private high school) had actually gotten pregnant by the thug. He did not like this and snuck up behind her and shot her in the head, killing her instantly. During the OJ Simpson case my grandmother used this as an opportunity to tell me that dating black men are very dangerous to date. I was also counseled not to befriend black women since White girls who hung out with black women tended to absorb the ghetto behavior of the black girls. </p>

		<p>As a relatively attractive, young, White women i can see how this happened. Unless you are a White women under 30 its hard to understand the constant assault we are placed under to race mix. Mix into the bombardment the natural timidity and people pleasing nature of White women and these atrocities happen. Personally I have been stalked, harassed and cornered by poc&rsquo;s. They have no shame and no dignity- they will follow you if you try to go out walking, cat calling and harassing you to the point of terror or tears, corner you in grocery stores, laundromats, anywhere. It has reached a point where since my beloved 130 lbs German Shepard died I do not leave the house with out a white male escort- and he dosen&rsquo;t leave without a certain Mr. Glock.  Even going to the bastions of liberalism called college, sane white men know better than to let a White women walk to her car unattended because of the poc&rsquo;s. Yet all we hear is how racist we are if we don&rsquo;t accept the advances of these thugs, and nothing but put downs about wonderful white men. I recall leaving my chemistry class and the 2 White Russian lab partners of mine would not let me walk to my car alone. They even offered to call campus security for an escort if I did not trust their intentions. I still recall their words of wisdom &#8220;You can no more trust a black man with White women, than you can a fox in a hen house.&#8221;  Seems to be only Americans who still foolishly think black are our friends. </p>

		<p>Everything else aside, I think the reconstructive surgeons did a fantastic job in helping her recover. I think she looks every bit as beautiful in the &#8220;after&#8221; photo as in the &#8220;before&#8221; one. (Unfortunately, the acid attack left her permanently blind in one eye.) Of course one can see the sadness in her face - maybe that sadness is also accompanied by some wisdom that wasn&rsquo;t present beforehand.</p>
<p>I wonder whether she listened to Nick Griffin&rsquo;s interview on national British TV? Maybe the light will come on if it hasn&rsquo;t already.</p>

		<p>To Mr. Thomas Jackson,</p>
<p>I commend you and your Wife&rsquo;s efforts. I was raised solely by my father, and he took very little interest in who I dated. I made some mistakes, not as great as the woman described in this article. Young men and women need guidance form their parents, and they DO want it even if they do not know it.</p>
<p>What is more, you did it in a very respectable manner. Sometimes people well do this in a less respectable manner- such as the scenario of the shot gun- and it discredits all of us. </p>
<p>This is important for all of us to remember. The stereotype of the conservative and racist idiot has to be removed. Unfortunately, we are one down, because you can still be an idiot and a liberal due to the liberal rejection of conventions.</p>

		<p>Thomas Jackson - when educating your children, it&rsquo;s also important, though some may scoff, to make them realize that a lot of school officials will be against what parents say. You should go talk to this &#8220;counselor&#8221; face to face btw. Anyway, you have to mold the child to believe the truth, and that truth is that the people telling your children you are racist (tell the kids these people will call you names) are only interested in destroying your family. Your kids need to hear the reality that these people, people like this counselor, want bad things to happen to them. The kids might not be able to grasp such thinking at first or for a while, but it has to be drummed into them I&rsquo;m sorry to say. </p>
<p>Your story brings back memories of a family I knew way back when. They had a 13 year old daughter in jr high and a black male, 26, who was working at the school as an &#8220;assistant&#8221; in the PE dept took a liking to her. He kept following her around, making remarks to her, asking her out on the sly, and finally managed to get the girl&rsquo;s address and just &#8220;happened&#8221; to be driving by when she arrived home from school. The girl had already been complaining about being harassed by these cretin, and of course school officials blew it off after the black said it was &#8220;racist lies&#8221;. The father knowing how the law works, sent his two (large and quite nervy) 16 and 17 year old sons out front to put an end to it. Which they did. (The father was true old country Irish and didn&rsquo;t take guff, and neither did his kids, to put it mildly - they used to scare the Hell out of us) Immediately after the festivities were finished, police were called. All I can say is that things worked out properly, as their was a record of her complaining about being harassed. The sons merely came to her aid during an assault. This may sound a bit cruel to some, but think of how cruelly whites have been treated by blacks for decades now with the full weight of the government, media and academia behind them. That family of &#8220;bog hoppers&#8221; as some called them knew instinctively how to handle the problem once official channels failed in their duty, and they knew how to handle official channels after they remedied the problem themselves. No, they never had a problem with or saw the black again. If this family didn&rsquo;t have the make-up of whites from &#8220;the old days&#8221; I have no doubt the black &#8220;assistant&#8221; would have ended up doing something horrible to the daughter. Instead he was given something to remind him what could happen if he tried to cross that line. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s such a shame that happened to a pretty white woman like her. But that&rsquo;s interracial dating for you.</p>
<p>My family and I knew this one white girl. She appearantly grew up to be a wild child from what I heard. She dated blacks and had two half-black kids. Not too long ago, she was stabbed to death by her black boyfriend who then killed himself.</p>
<p>Fathers obviously know what they&rsquo;re doing when they forbid their daughters to date non-whites. Being &#8220;open-minded and tolerant&#8221; is for people who have a death wish.</p>

		<p>I agree with you guys about the media 24/7 bombardment.  HBO is constantly running a new documentary (or movie portrayed as a documentary) in which racist whites are harrassing nice, lawabiding blacks.</p>
<p>I read a statistic somewhere that 99% of the villans in horror films and tv movies are white guys.  The movies usually show dementeed white guys running abound with chain saws, knives, etc. and the detective in the movie is usually an upright black guy that saves the people from the white guys.  It is just a constant stream.</p>

<p>Given these social pressures, I always find it puzzling how seldom white women actually do race-mix. Here at the mainly white college I work at, the black men seem to be oddly likely to be seeing Asian-American girls instead of white ones. And those few white girls who do race-mix seem to do so mainly with mixed-race men who are part-white themselves. I think some may have a NIMBY attitude   &mdash;   &#8220;it&rsquo;s cool to race-mix, just so long as my friends do it, but I won&rsquo;t do it myself.&#8221; Also, I have seen other whites who seem enchanted with hip hop culture but can&rsquo;t stand blacks in real life.</p>

<p>&gt; Sadly, you are likely right too much of the time.  I have a cousin whose daughter was raped by Hispanics (gang raped), and even though he moved to Idaho, she ended up getting pregnant while in NCY (school sports trip) by some unknown black - and that wasn&rsquo;t a case of rape.

<p>Hollywood is run by producers who decide what movies get made and how much money is spent making and promoting them.  The current trend to portray non-whites as heroic, noble, professional, in positions of authority, and sexy is a direct consequence of the decision making powers of the producers, acting on whatever agenda they are following.</p>
<p>To impressionable whites, who take guidance from popular culture, this gives a green light to engage in relationships across racial lines.  In their minds, They think they&rsquo;re interacting with people who are just like the on-screen characters.</p>

<p>Interesting isn&rsquo;t it that the press is so naive in their leftist mindset that they seem unaware or are in denial that this black should be considered deranged only if he were white?</p>
<p>Too bad this reporter is too lazy to look up black on white attacks both here and the UK.  If he did, he would find that this sort of racial attack is not unusual in the least.</p>
<p>For a white to do this, he would have to be some kind of nut job.<br>
Unfortunately, 1984 arrived quite some time ago, so, on second thought, I doubt that the reporter would even recognize the difference.  He just doesn&rsquo;t have the mentality for it.</p>

<p>Actually she had NOTHING in common with him and never could. If she had had just a little bit of racial awareness or appreciation of what blacks are really like she would have known this immediately. If I were a young, pretty White girl like that and some 6&rsquo;4&#8221; &#8220;macho&#8221; black came near me I would have run away as fast as my legs could carry me. In her case she tragically did the opposite. </p>

		<p>Joe #27&hellip;YES&hellip;only now its Genetic Marxism being effectuated and not just sicio-economic. The redistribution of genetic/white wealth. I started noticing this some 20 yrs. ago and would wait for the show to end, watching the names of the people responsible and I saw a pattern.. I was furious&hellip;</p>

		<p>Blaming this girl accomplishes nothing. She doesn&rsquo;t have the critical thinking skills to see what is obvious to us. She is more child like and should be judged as such. If anyone&rsquo;s to blame it&rsquo;s us for cowardly allowing the delusional left to control society.</p>

		<p>Deplorable as what happened to Katie Piper is&hellip; I cannot feel a drop of sympathy. She took up with a non-White, so whatever consequences she suffered are ultimately her own fault!</p>

		<p>Your natural sympathies raised by the horrible experiences of Katie Piper (and many others like her) is unfortunately undercut by her total want of any good sense! </p>
<p>Far too many white women  &mdash;  especially very attractive ones  &mdash;  nowadays substitute political correctness for good sense. Such women try to prove that they are not &#8220;racists&#8221; by dating and mating with the first Black they encounter, no matter how violence prone, infantile, and generally pathogenic such men are. Some such women even become pen-pals to imprisoned rapists and wait to meet them when they are released! They also, like most modern women, also let their interest in immediate sexual contact overshadow their natural, time-honored feminine needs for committment, depth of relationship, and permanance. They never test the male for qualities in him which are necessary for a permanant relationship.</p>
<p>The consequences follow quite naturally from the pursuit of a &#8220;relationship&#8221; that can never transcend the purely physical. When the attraction is to a man who is uncontrollably inclined to violent outbursts, poor impulse control, and (perhaps) expressing long-standing resentment of White people generally, and white women in particular&hellip;tragedy results!</p>
<p>Miss Piper was lucky to escape with her life. I hope she( and other such women) learn from her dreadful experience!</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!!<br>

		<p>This is just one of thousands of victims of the multi-culti propaganda campaign of the last 40 years.<br>
White women(who seem more gullible to fall for this)are often the ones who are taught and encouraged to engage in miscegenation throughout their entire lives in the government school system and of course the media.</p>
<p>Not only is dating encouraged,but resisting the impulse to take another elevator if theirs is occupied by a single black male for fear of &#8220;looking like a racist&#8221;.<br>
The actress Kelly MgGillis was gang raped by two blacks because &#8220;she opened the door to them&#8221;,no doubt this was due to her liberal feelings of not wanting to appear as a bigot.<br>
Predatory non-whites utilize this inhibition in order to trap their primary prey,gullible white women.<br>
I explain it this way to my wife:your life &amp; safety is way more important than some black persons feelings.<br>
Go ahead,appear to be a racist sometimes,your life depends on it.</p>

		<p>The assault on Katie Piper was vile beyond belief; but before anyone uses this to damn all non-whites, it should be pointed out that Katie&rsquo;s surgeon was called Mohammad Ali Jawad.</p>

		<p>Heinrich do you know by chance, what the ratio is of acid splashing face melters to gifted surgeons may be?<br>
(Either globally or just in Britain.)</p>
<p>Would one cancel out the other?<br>
Or would you go into the dangerous politically incorrect territory of saying that one is not equal worth of the other?</p>
<p>How quickly are violent brutes produced in this world compared to life savers?  <br>
Is one born and the other made?<br>
Or were they both made or both born?<br>
If you had both of these individuals swap lives would the end outcomes stay exactly the same, you think?</p>
<p>These are the types of questions we explore here.<br>
Or would you prefer that these subjects are made illegal and are never talked about again?</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>
