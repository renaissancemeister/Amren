<h1><a href="https://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/10/hispanic_residents_complain_of.html">Hispanic Residents Complain of Police Harassment</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Ewinger, The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dozens of Hispanic residents complained Wednesday that they are harassed by local police acting on behalf of federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies in Lake and Ashtabula counties deny singling out Hispanics, and say they are treating Latinos like everyone else.</p>
<p>Veronica Dahlberg, executive director of the Organization of Hispanic Women in Lake and Ashtabula, or HOLA, said the increased roundups have created such fear in the Latino community that people will not call police even when they are crime victims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ashtabula police did not respond to inquires for this story, but Ashtabula County Sheriff Billy Johnson said his deputies stop people only if they believe a law has been broken.</p>
<p>Johnson said his department gets state funds for special programs, including running drunken-driving checkpoints. He said even if they pull over a bus with 100 people on it, they check the IDs of everyone aboard.</p>
<p>David Leopold, a Cleveland lawyer specializing in immigration issues, said the Ohio attorney general&rsquo;s office issued an opinion in 2007 that he thinks applies to all local law enforcement, stating that undocumented immigrants could be held, arrested or detained only if they were suspected of having committed a crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Ohio attorney general&rsquo;s opinion said local authorities can hold illegal immigrants  &mdash;  if federal authorities issue a detainer  &mdash;  or if the immigrants have committed a crime.</p>
<p>Lake County Sheriff Dan Dunlap said his deputies do not make so-called pretextual traffic stops, in which they have no real reason to pull someone over.</p>
<p>Dunlap said targeting immigrants would be futile &#8220;because if they do get deported, they&rsquo;re back here in six weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dahlberg said that the Latinos, undocumented or not, are wage earners whose taxes help subsidize the police who are not protecting them.</p>

<p>The reason that people in the &#8220;Latino community&#8221; are crime victims because they tolerate so many of their young men becoming criminals.  It doesn&rsquo;t much matter if people in the &#8220;Latino community&#8221; are scared to call the cops b/c they&rsquo;re here illegally (though this is Cleveland, Ohio   &mdash;   they probably have some sort of formal or informal sanctuary city policy), the more &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; (either Chicano, Mestizo or Afro-Caribbean) the place becomes, the more crime there will be.</p>
<p>This being Cleveland, an eastern city, I bet most Hispanics there are of the Afro-Caribbean variety.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sheriff on the futility of immigration enforcement: &ldquo;If they do get deported, they&rsquo;re back here in six weeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the mestizo supporters here in this country want poeople to believe.  They want to create the belief that deportation is all a waste of time and money, so let them stay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any figures verifying that premise to be untrue, but if I draw upon my experiences while living in three of the border states I have to say that deportation to the average alien discourages them from returning, with the exception of the border states.</p>
<p>That would exclude the dope dealers and other criminals too no matter where they are, because they have the reasons, means and money to return:  They have to come back to ply their criminality.  It&rsquo;s not profitable in Mexico.  Also, they won&rsquo;t be treated so kindly there either after pulling a crime.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m remembering correctly, also, coming back after deportation is a felony or at the very least a serious misdemeanor.</p>
<p>But, the bottom line to all this is that the majority are not dope dealers so they need some kind of work.   If they don&rsquo;t have a reasonable expectation of work, they&rsquo;ll stay home when they&rsquo;re deported, and they won&rsquo;t sneak into the country in the first place.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t you imagine what the news media would be saying if Mexico were home to whites instead of mestizos?</p>
<p>They would blast the Mexican government for not providing work for their people.  There would be hundreds of stories in newspapers outlining Mexican corruption yelling about how they won&rsquo;t contain their people to south of the border.  It would be regurgitated over and over again on all the radical leftist T.V. shows, until it made everybody sick to listen to it.</p>
<p>But since we are dealing with non-whites, we will never see even a slight hint by the media about the corruption in Mexico that sends these peons to our land.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that fact that they are in the country ILLEGALLY, constitute a crime already? Some of us, including me, Have said England is gone, so too, is the U.S. SORRY!!! I meant the Estados Unidos  (spelling?)</p>

		<p>This is one reason why a &#8220;multiracial nation&#8221; is no nation at all.  The moment you define yourself as &#8220;multiracial&#8221;, you have difficulty defending your borders - because there are no physical characteristics that allow one to discern between foreigners and citizens.  How then are authorities supposed to locate those who are in the country illegally?  The entire notion of a &#8220;concept nation&#8221; is flawed.  In reality, it always ends up being little more than a crime syndicate that lords over a specific territory</p>

		<p>What are hispancis talking about. They&rsquo;re targeting illegals. If one is in the country legally, than they have nothing to worry about. If not, then they should be not only hassled but deported. It&rsquo;s like those who drive too fast  accusing the cops of hassling them for speeding. Get real.</p>
<p>PS- Speaking of harassment, it&rsquo;s &#8220;harassment&#8221; of our citizens when our government wants more of our tax dollars to pay for these illegals and their free medical care, it&rsquo;s &#8220;harassment&#8221; when our young girls are sexually harassed and leered at or worse raped and it&rsquo;s &#8220;harassment&#8221; when illegals drive drunk on our roadways and kill people. etc.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s dangerously close to any of a number of true civil rights violations. It is perhaps better to say simply that it is better to seize, on weapons charges, those who are visibly carrying weapons than it is to target those who are not.</p>
<p>Go where the fish bite.</p>

<p><br>
If that is really the case, what option will police officers be left with? Shoot them?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not, but I feel things are going to get very ugly, someday.</p>
