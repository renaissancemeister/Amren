			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, October 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Media Department at the Federation for American Immigration Reform has just published a &#8220;Guide to Understanding the Tactics of the Southern Poverty Law Center in the Immigration Debate.&#8221; The guide was designed to help journalists better understand the unscrupulous methods used by the SPLC to discredit organizations, like FAIR, and to attack the American people who support enforcing the immigration laws already on the books and oppose efforts to pass a mass-amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>As FAIR&rsquo;s Press Release highlighted, the key conclusions of the report were:</p>
<p>* The SPLC has no self-avowed immigration policy expertise yet they exploit the current national debate to increase fundraising. Their inflammatory charges against FAIR and others are politically driven, factually distorted, and wildly exaggerated for the purpose of making their mission more urgent in order to raise vast sums of money.</p>
<p>* Third party analysis by The Nation, Harpers, and even the SPLC&rsquo;s hometown newspaper, the Montgomery Advertiser, all came to the same conclusion; the SPLC is a self-propagating fundraising machine with little regard for the truth.</p>
<p>* SPLC offers no objective criteria for their &#8220;hate group&#8221; designations nor is there any basis in fact to their claim that hate crimes are rising due to the immigration debate.</p>
<p>* When writing about the immigration issue, journalists have an obligation to test the accuracy of the SPLC&rsquo;s information, question their motives, seek out responses to their allegations, and clearly distinguish between advocacy and news reporting.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 8, 2009, FAIR&rsquo;s Media Director, Bob Dane, participated in an interview with Accuracy in Media.</p>

		<p>I could add another key conclusion:</p>
<p>* The Bernie Madoff scandal, as well as the overall decline in stock prices recently and the economy, has hurt the bottom lines of people who usually give a lot of money to the SPLC.  In a desperate move to regain their fund raising mojo, the SPLC is reaching further and further down into the well in order to find &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What if &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; are increasing at the same time the nation talks about immigration? No one in the entire nation can even discuss immigration? Immigration continues unabated, and as the pro-immigration idealist&rsquo;s would like it, the subject cannot even be talked about?</p>
<p>Besides, we all know that if the real truth could be discussed, it is immigrants themselves committing a great deal of the violence, a great deal of the interracial kind, with whites using violence the least. </p>

		<p>I have to give credit to Alexander Cockburn whose leftist site Counterpunch has long documented the shameless money-grubbing of Morris &#8220;the Sleaze&#8221; Dees. </p>
