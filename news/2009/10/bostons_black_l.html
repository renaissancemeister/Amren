<h1><a href="http://www.wbur.org/2009/10/06/black-political-clout">Boston&rsquo;s Black Leaders Wonder If Community Has Lost Its Clout</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bianca Vazquez Toness, WBUR-FM (Boston), October 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to the most recent census estimates, nearly one in every four Bostonians is black. Mayor Thomas Menino and challenger Michael Flaherty are courting black voters, but some wonder if black Boston is losing its political power.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was once the premier civil rights group in America. Boston had the first chapter and, in the 1960s, 5,000 people were in the organization. The NAACP led the fights against school segregation and housing discrimination in Boston, but now the group is a lot less outspoken, said member Sarah-Ann Shaw.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the way into the 1980s, black ministers used to protest outside City Hall and educate parishioners in the pews about issues and candidates.</p>
<p>Pastor Bruce Wall led some of those protests, but now, &#8220;the ministers are so dependent upon the government for faith-based grants, for property, for little things that the government is giving them,&#8221; Wall said. &#8220;The ministers are not independent to speak their minds.&#8221; Without activist pastors, Wall worries that Boston&rsquo;s blacks are losing their &#8220;political potency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some think they already have.</p>
<p>Activist Horace Small is trying to organize black people to demand better public schools. He said Boston&rsquo;s blacks missed an opportunity with this mayoral race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have any clout,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;For instance, we have four guys running for mayor, and none of us had enough sense to say, OK, none of these cats become mayor unless the black community votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what is the black community in Boston? The most recent census shows that the overall black population is shrinking in Boston. While African-Americans have been leaving the city, they are being replaced by Haitians, Dominicans and Somalis, but not at the same pace.</p>
<p>Small said no one has figured out how to integrate immigrant interests into a unified black agenda. But there is common ground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finding this common ground could help blacks in Boston have political clout, said Simone Miles, who helped start a group called Think Politics to educate voters and encourage black candidates to run for office. The problem, she said, is complacency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But activist Horace Small said black people in Boston still to have to pressure these candidates to meet the black agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Flaherty is a personal friend of mine. I like Mike. But I don&rsquo;t know which Mike is running for office,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if this is the guy who&rsquo;s to the right of Louise Day Hicks or to the left of Gandhi. I remember when he was president of the City Council and would stop conversation on things that impact people and, in particular, people of color. Who are you bro?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Haitians and Somalians are black, and Dominicans are mulatto Caribbean black.  The NAACP should have no trouble, except if domestic blacks in Boston are upset that the new immigrant blacks are jumping through the line for white liberal guilt handouts.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get better public schools by &#8220;demanding better public schools.&#8221;  If it were possible, it would have been done years ago.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on here then!  Aren&rsquo;t Afro-Americans supposed to align with their racial bruthas and help fight the good fight against horrible old Whitey?   Well, I never!!! Fancy them not getting along with one another.</p>

<p>Perhaps, repatriating them all back to the various parts of the African continent they originate from, might help.<br>

		<p>Blacks are not being displaced in Boston, but whites are.  Just a few decades ago Boston was a white working-class city with a few black enclaves.  Whites started fleeing in the 70s when forced integration began, and the flood has continued unabated to the present day.  The change has been astounding.  Today, most whites in Boston are college students, alternative-lifestyle bohemians, corporate carpetbaggers, or trust-fund liberals.  Only a few white middle-class enclaves remain.  Formerly working class Polish/Irish/Italian neighborhoods have been transformed to non-white slums, which receive massive government subsidies.          </p>

		<p>One out of four people living in Boston are black.  Does this mean, another lost city submerged into African like standard of living?  This is like a cancerous destruction of this country.  This country is finished as shown by the debt load, flood of third world peoples, destruction of the basic economic base, coruption and incompetent government officials, dumbing down of the educational system, etc.  Why does this country need so many third world peoples under the brain washing smoke screen of diversity and that this country is all migrants  &mdash;  even the American Indians?  These third world peoples are uneducated, jobless barely able to function in an advanced society.  What is the reason for this insane flooding?  The genetic make-up of these peoples do not benefit an advanced society rather they are an albatross.  The better way is to leave them in their own countries and try to better them there.  This path will eventually be taken up by future generations.        </p>

<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s going to fix Boston&rsquo;s schools is better demographics.</p>
<p>These are the current demographics of the Boston Public Schhol District:<br>
White - 13.4%<br>
Black - 39.3%<br>
Hispanic - 36.7%<br>
American Indian/Alaska Native - 0.4%<br>
Multi-Racial - 1.5%</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re spending a lot of money in the Boston school district ($16,988 per student vs the US average of about $9,000) but they&rsquo;re not going good results because of the student demographics.</p>

		<p>I went to college in Boston, way back in 1979.  As a southerner, I was amazed at how down on &#8220;blacks&#8221; many of the locals I met were.  It&rsquo;s a weird culture there; ultra PC commie leadership like Kennedy et al, co-exists with staunch white-pride Irish, Italians etc. as well as remnants of the anglo-saxon Puritans.</p>

		<p>The story states that some African-Americans have been leaving Boston and moving to the suburbs.  True enough.  However, what the eminent Bianca Vazquez Tonesst fails to report are the circumstances under which blacks are moving.  In most cases, blacks are not squirreling away their pennies to buy a $360,000 house in a leafy suburb.  Instead, they are moving into <br>
Section 8 or other &#8220;low-cost housing,&#8221; which is paid for by the state. </p>

		<p>Should it surprise anyone that blacks who have been crying for special privileges for years now want to deny latecomers a piece of the pie?  It has always been all about me with these people. Even as they lose in numbers they want to fix the system so that they have the same clout as before.  </p>

How true.  And to think that Ben Franklin was concerned that the country might be getting too many Germans!</p>
<p>Ha! If only!<br>
Little could he have imagined. <br>
If those forefathers could return today, they would repudiate nearly every last one of those traitors now in government who claim to be upholding the Constitution.</p>

		<p>Quick!!  Someone call Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something else) and inform him his Rainbow Coalition has died an unnatural death!</p>
<p>The N.A.A.C.P. might not be as outspoken anymore, but count on one sure thing&hellip; they still have their greedy hands out, asking, demanding contributions (shakedowns, I believe being the proper term).<br>
