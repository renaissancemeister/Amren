			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, October 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Geert Wilders, the Dutch far-right politician, has won his appeal against the Government&rsquo;s refusal to let him enter Britain.</p>
<p>Wilders challenged the decision by then home secretary Jacqui Smith which led to him being turned back at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>The ruling by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal means the head of the Freedom Party, who is accused of Islamophobia, could now be allowed into the country.</p>
<p>He was due to show his short film Fitna, which criticises the Koran as a &#8220;fascist book&#8221;, at the House of Lords in February.</p>
<p>But Ms Smith said his presence had the potential to &#8220;threaten community harmony and therefore public safety&#8221;.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said the Government was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the ruling.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are disappointed by the court&rsquo;s decision today. The Government opposes extremism is all its forms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to refuse Wilders admission was taken on the basis that his presence could have inflamed tensions between our communities and have led to inter-faith violence. We still maintain this view.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The government wants to ban Freedom of Speech in cases where it might &#8220;inflame tensions.&#8221;  However, this is exactly when you need Freedom of Speech.  Freedom of Speech was designed to allow people to say things (such as truths) that might be uncomfortable to others. It allows diversity of opinions and minority or alternative opinions to be voiced.  The alternative is to only allow one opinion (i.e., that of the ruling elites).</p>
<p>Reserving Freedom of Speech for only subjects for which everyone agrees is pointless.  Reserving Freedom of Speech for only ideas sanctioned by our &#8220;rulers&#8221; is evil.  Stupid leftest bureaucrats! </p>

		<p>Great Britain has awakened: <br>
	<br>
        Britain&rsquo;s indigenous population is suffering; multiculturalism is reserved for the lower classes, poor whites are the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values while hiding in their gated communities. <br>
	It&rsquo;s the poor whites who are living shoulder to shoulder among foreigners who show nothing but contempt for the indigenous population, whites are being attacked assaulted robbed even raped in disproportionate numbers; whites are often singled out as easy targets by other races because they present less resistance, you can&rsquo;t fix the problem by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br>
	<br>
God bless the BNP<br>

<p>&#8220;his presence could have inflamed tensions between our communities and have led to inter-faith violence.&#8221; No, the reaction would be unilateral - there is no &#8220;inter-&#8221; faith tension or violence in the UK, there is just Islamic violence and threats of violence. The pretence that there are somehow two sides to the problem is the government cravenly ingratiating itself with muslims.  </p>

Exactly why I carry a .357 in my pocket. I like to think of myself as changing perceptions, one street encounter at a time. Try it!! When you are packing, you glow!, absolutely glow, confidence. I hope it carries over to people who are not armed, giving  them some sort of umbrella of protection&hellip;</p>

		<p>He said: &ldquo;We are disappointed by the court&rsquo;s decision today. The Government opposes extremism is all its forms.</p>
<p>Unless it is Politically Correct extremest. The only extremest you oppose are white, christian, and Jews who want to keep a Jahadi from cutting the heads off of their people.<br>
(jews have to be included because the nazis want to prevent Mike Savage from having a voice.</p>
<p>It used to be the man leading the rioters were the disturbers of the peace&hellip;now whites and only whites must be quiet lest a minority be offended and riot.The Liberals assume that non-whites are incapable of not rioting so it is the white man who must walk carefully. Liberals fully do not expect nonwhites to act white. </p>

 So does this statement mean that the British government realizes what I&rsquo;ve been saying al along???&#8221;&#8220;mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims or blacks&#8221;&#8221; we know what happens.</p>

<p>Just WHO is perceived as presenting &#8220;&#8221;an easy target?  Certainly not the Moslems! So I wonder who it could be.</p>
<p>  &mdash;   &ldquo;Threaten community harmony and therefore public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Threaten WHAT community and WHAT public?  Which community is the one constantly making threats? Causing riots?  Which community is the one planting bombs, committing assasinations and beheadings?   </p>
<p>(It must be those violent British!  I cant&rsquo; imagine anyone else.)   :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Islamophobia&rdquo;  &mdash;  Is that now an official, legally defined crime?</p>
<p>&gt; They can add me to their list too.  But I am also prime for the list of Christophobics, Judiaphobes, and suffer from religiophobia in general.  But it gives me a remarkable clarity of mind that I am sure Gert Wilders could relate to.</p>

<p>Im&rsquo; not so sure.  Wilders&rsquo; obsession seems to be strictly limited to Islamophobia, and nothing beyond that.  For all the rest of them, it&rsquo;s hear no evil, see no evil.  For them, he couldn&rsquo;t care less.<br>
Maybe he has chosen his battles carefully and figures he can handle only one thing on his plate at a time, but I don&rsquo;t know about him. I have to wonder about this apparent neo-con who only attacks what is fashionable to attack (at least in some circles).</p>
