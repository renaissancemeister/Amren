<h1>Our Mission and Outreach Efforts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Home Depot, October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Mission</b></p>
<p>Our mission is to form mutually beneficial partnerships with diverse businesses that allow us to deliver superior products and services and superb customer service, which ultimately increases shareholder value.</p>
<p>We are committed to creating effective competition utilizing all possible sources. We will actively seek targeted diverse businesses and provide them the opportunity to partner with The Home Depot to provide competitively priced, high quality goods and services to our customers.</p>
<p><b>Outreach</b></p>
<p>In our efforts to actively reach out to diverse businesses, we have chosen several different vehicles to enhance our outreach efforts in order to build upon our program. First, we are national members of the Women&rsquo;s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and the National Minority Suppliers Development Council ( NMSDC). We also sponsor and attend national and regional diverse supplier and small business trade shows as well as chamber events.</p>
<p>In late 2005 The Home Depot became the title sponsor of a new non-profit organization created to foster growth in small businesses. The mission of The Resource Institute TRI which was co-founded by K. Michelle Johnson, Director of Supplier Diversity for Home Depot and David Zalik, CEO of GreenSky Financial. The mission of TRI is to help small, minority and women owned businesses grow by providing access to resources, including training, buyer networking, consulting and capital sources.</p>
<p>Finally, we advertise in publications that are geared toward diverse business owners. We believe these vehicles, in conjunction with our web site, will assist us in effectively identifying prospective suppliers who will partner with us as we continue to grow our business.</p>

<p>Home Depot and its fraternal twin do nothing but peddle inferior products, pretty much like the rest of American companies, er global companies, these days.  And, once again, the consumer is to blame.  We chose cheap over quality, we chose big box over mom &amp; pop.  Now, those big boxes are pushing diversity and multiculturalism, and whites are being dispossessed en masse.  The root of the problem for us is with us and we need to look no further than the closest mirror.  Cheap products &amp; services, low quality, cheap labor and a weak mind = suicide!<br>

		<p>This article makes me glad to know that Home Depot is hurting worse than the average corporation, because the building industry has been hit the hardest.  I don&rsquo;t buy there unless I have to.</p>
<p>Another corrupt diversity business is UPS.  They brag on their web site that 40% of their work force is minority.  Fed X is equally as bad, and both are so disgusting it&rsquo;s a shame the other delivery companies don&rsquo;t offer the broad reach these two do, so we can drop them and go elsewhere for package delivery.  I use these two also only when I have no other choice.</p>

		<p>Just as affirmative action puts lesser qualifed people ahead of other better qualifed people in jobs, schools etc., this policy says Home Depot will purchase supplies from minority owned businesses even it it costs more, therefore the customers end up paying more, just so Home Depot can pat themselves on the back for being such good corporate citizens. How laughable!</p>
<p>Price and merchandise quality should be the main factors determining where Home Depot gets their stuff from, with the possible exception of not patronizing third world sweat shop industries. Affirmative action buying policys don&rsquo;t do the customer a bit of good at the checkout stand. And Made In USA doesn&rsquo;t count for much as they don&rsquo;t make most of what they sell in the USA anymore anyway.</p>

		<p>All of which is why I deal with Lowes. Arthur Blank, owner of Home Depot along with the Atlanta Falcons was also Michael Vick&rsquo;s best bud while he was on the team, often having dinner with him, supplying him with extra &#8216;incentives&rsquo; such as cars, women and lots of liquor. He also set up day labor tents in the parking lots of his stores. Not such a good judge of character.</p>

		<p>   I am in the remodeling business (or what&rsquo;s left of it}.  I have had an account with Home Depot for some 15? years.  Before getting into construction I worked in retail.  I can tell you now that Home  Depot is a disaster when it comes to retail business.  I live in the Atlanta area, and I mean close to the city limits.  The hired help at every Home Depot is predominantly minorty/black.  Generally  the average &#8220;worker&#8221;  knows little  other than how to shuck and jive and talk to other blacks about trivial things.  For the most part I know infinitely more about everything in the store than the  hired help which are advertised  as helpful experts.  Home Depot is doomed.  You can&rsquo;t make chicken salad out of chicken,  well &hellip;you know.  Also, check out their stock value. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a grad student studying human resources. In our studies of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; discrimination I learned that Home Depot has been repeatedly targeted by the EEOC for bogus discrimination lawsuits. They have paid out over $100 million  over the past few years. You can&rsquo;t blame them for putting out these absurd press releases. Affirmative action must end or all American business will be destroyed.</p>

<p>Thank you, Jared.  This story was not in either of my local or regional newspapers. I can buy a 2x3 at HD for $1.30, or spend $1.42 per at either of the local lumberyards, all 3 no closer than 2 miles away.  For the extra .12, the local yards will load it and tie it.  To save the .12, I could rent a HD truck for 19.95/hour.  God bless America!</p>

		<p>As far as possible avoid buying from non-White businesses and corporations who promote diversity. Do not even give a cent or a penny to our enemies. I always do a lot of background check on a company on the internet (Does it harm the interests of Whites and does it harm the environment etc&hellip;) before buying any of their products Higher the company is in diversity promotion, less likely am I in buying their products and services. Buy European if needed.</p>

		<p>The last major purchase (&#8220;major&#8221; by my standards,at least) at Home Depot was an large toolbox for a couple of hundred bucks. The two characters that loaded it for me hinted very unsubtly that a TIP was in order. I would have had a hard time believing it from white kids,but these were two black guys working in the loading area so I don&rsquo;t suppose it should have surprised me.</p>
<p>And the employee makeup of that particular store was very reflective of the raunchier parts of the Austin metro area. No one I knew liked going there,because of the mob of illegals haunting the parking lot begging for work. Turning into the parking lot off of the IH35 frontage road was-very literally-playing bumper tag with a bunch of mestizos. I don&rsquo;t even like to think about the lawsuits (LULAC sponsored,I&rsquo;m sure) that would have resulted had one of these screwballs been tagged.</p>
<p>That store closed down last year. Can&rsquo;t imagine why.</p>

		<p>I live right next door to a home depot, (fortunately not one plagued by droves of Hispanics looking for day labor.) However the several times I have wanted to buy home improvement items such as paint or lumber or the like, I have driven across town to save money and frustration from dim-witted, clueless employees who were either indifferent to the fact that they had a customer waiting or didn&rsquo;t know what they carried or where. The one and only time I graced their doors I was told that the item I wanted  &mdash;  candlestick replacements for a chandelier  &mdash;  wasn&rsquo;t comercially sold. I found them on a shelf in the lighting department. I thought about showing them to the employee that told me there was no such item, but he was over on the other side of the store shucking and jiving with his fellow witless co-&#8220;workers&#8221;, so I shrugged and left, never to return.</p>

		<p>The poster that stated Home Depot is doomed, I believe, is absolutely correct. I have bought things from them over the years, and watched how they manage their stores. Horribly, in one word. How many times have I gone to get something and have been promised by the orginal employee that I asked for help that they would get someone else because they were busy at the moment. Naturally no one would come, and I would them ask another person walking by. They would tell me they&rsquo;e get someone right away  &mdash;  no one would come. Slackers and dumbkofs, with little work ethic isn&rsquo;t going to make a business succeed. Yes, Home Depot will go under, it&rsquo;s just that being so huge it will take awhile. P.S. To be fair to those employees that actually work, much of this stuff has to be blamed on the executive managment, as is true of so many American businesses. I am quite sure they are doing their part to rob the business blind, as each year goes by.  </p>

		<p>To get an idea of their problems, realize that their stock went sideways during the biggest housing boom in american history. Ouch.</p>
<p>I used to work for Home Depot. I was not a skilled pro, but I learned what I could from books and did a lot of repairs on my own. That way, I wasn&rsquo;t just a deer in the headlights when someone asked me a question. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stores seem to be full of blacks these days, unless you are in a lilly-white area. Blacks are not much interested in reading, and if they were to read something, it would not be about home improvements. That&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t own their own homes. They rent apartments or have Section 8 houses. Even when they do have their own houses, they aren&rsquo;t particularly interested in making them look nice. They are interested in spending money on other things.</p>
<p>If you must patronize HD, walk past the blacks and go straight to the hardware department. There, you will hopefully find The Grizzled Middle-Aged White Guy (TGMAWG). They are always in hardware, and I don&rsquo;t know why. They just are. You can identify TGMAWG by their flannel shirts, reading glasses, and moustaches. They will be able to answer your questions, even if it&rsquo;s not their department. And you can rest assured, they have actually gotten their hands dirty doing whatever it is you&rsquo;re contemplating.</p>

<p>By &#8220;lilly-white,&#8221; do you mean crime-free? Is &#8220;lilly-white&#8221; a demographic represented by respectful children and functional government services?</p>

<p>You see, I live (thankfully) in a 98% white, mostly rural community. However, at 5-10 and 200pds, I&rsquo;m small compared to my neighbors. &#8220;Lilly&#8221; is not an adjective I&rsquo;d associate with any of us, despite the area&rsquo;s homogeneity.</p>
<p>And as for &#8220;grizzled,&#8221; yes, the elders in my area tend to be grizzled, an appearance they picked up in Viet Nam and Kuwait. </p>

I agree with you on the lily white thing, however, because it&rsquo;s mostly used by those professional leftists who spend their lives denigrating whites, but I&rsquo;m not accusing Mr. Kramer of being one.</p>

		<p>To Bobby:</p>
<p>I realize that I can be overly sensitive to terms like &#8220;white boy,&#8221; &#8220;lilly white,&#8221; etc. I must admit to using my size and stature (in person) in not-so-gentlemanly ways when turning on people who bandy them about. </p>
<p>However, the reason for my sensitivity is exactly as you mentioned: they are terms used mainly by &#8220;lefties&#8221; (who seem to be overwhelmingly white themselves) as a sort of backhanded insult at anything white they disapprove of. </p>
<p>I often feel that my behavior walks the fine line of immaturity, but I&rsquo;m just sick of watching white people take whatever comes at them. </p>
<p>From all the years that we as whites have been tiptoeing around the veritable minefield of minority identifiers (latino vs. hispanic, black vs. african-american, etc) I&rsquo;ve lost some of the buffer zone of patience towards verbal slights. </p>
<p>I included the heartfelt disclaimer though for a reason&hellip;Rex Kramer may have used the term &#8220;lilly white&#8221; in a completely benign fashion, and I&rsquo;m simply overreacting. </p>
