<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2129036">Granting Asylum to White South African &#8216;Perverse,&rsquo; Ottawa Says</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Norma Greenaway, Canwest News Service, October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government has denounced as &#8220;perverse&#8221; a refugee board ruling that granted asylum to white South African Brandon Huntley on the grounds he could face persecution in his homeland because of his skin color.</p>
<p>In a written submission to the Federal Court of Canada, the government said the ruling that Mr. Huntley&rsquo;s claim was &#8220;justified&#8221; is unreasonable and based on a &#8220;jaundiced assessment&#8221;, by the one-man board, of conditions within South Africa.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney is asking the Federal Court for permission to seek a judicial review of the ruling by board member William Davis.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis&rsquo; ruling in late August sparked outrage in South Africa where, among other things, the governing African National Congress said the reasoning behind the decision &#8220;can only serve to perpetuate racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Abraham Sokhaya Nkomo, South Africa&rsquo;s ambassador to Canada, told Canwest News Service Mr. Davis&rsquo;s ruling was shocking and could seriously damage relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Within days, the federal government announced it was taking the rare step of appealing a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board.</p>
<p>The federal submission took Davis to task for effectively accepting Huntley&rsquo;s argument that he did not seek police protection after allegedly being attacked six or seven times by black South Africans because he did not trust a police force dominated by blacks to help him.</p>
<p>It said Mr. Huntley, who hails from Cape Town, failed to provide &#8220;clear and convincing&#8221; evidence of the South African government&rsquo;s inability to protect him.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis&rsquo; implicit acceptance of Mr. Huntley&rsquo;s argument represents a &#8220;disturbing view&#8221; that &#8220;rests largely on the board&rsquo;s jaundiced assessment of the country conditions,&#8221; the government said.</p>
<p>It took strong issue with the statement by Mr. Huntley, who is living in Ottawa, he would stick out like a &#8220;sore thumb&#8221; because of his colour if he was forced to live anywhere in South Africa.</p>
<p>Dismissing the statement as &#8220;unreasonable and perverse,&#8221; the government cited figures from Statistics South Africa that said whites form a sizeable minority in the country, ranging from 23.9% of the population of Pretoria, for example, to 16% in both Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The government said that while it is &#8220;indisputable&#8221; that crime is prevalent in South Africa, all South Africans are affected, regardless of race.</p>

<p>Yet on another case, they allowed a Haitian refugee into the country even though he is a known drug smuggler and was involved in several murders in Haiti for which he claimed were frame-ups by the police.</p>

		<p>So the Canadian government finally found a refugee it didn&rsquo;t like after four decades of letting &#8216;em in with a wink and a nod?  What are the odds that the guy happens to be white.</p>
<p>If I were him, in the appeal I&rsquo;d have my lawyer compile a list of all the &#8220;rare cases&#8221; in which affirmative refugee decisions have been appealed by the government   &mdash;   probably almost none   &mdash;   and see if any patterns emerge.  Maybe a discrimination counterclaim back in the face of Canadian govt for singling out white applicants would be in order.  It would be worth seeing anyways&hellip;</p>

<p><p>I suggest that the Canadian Immigration Minister take a month sabbatical in Johannesburg, or maybe stay that time on an Afrikaner farm in a remote area - as a private citizen, without any Canadian-supplied security.  Then, if he&rsquo;s still alive and in one piece, I&rsquo;ll listen to his views on Mr. Huntley&rsquo;s claims - absent that, I find them not only &#8220;perverse,&#8221; but profoundly ignorant.</p></p>

		<p>The only reason whites haven&rsquo;t been completely annihilated in South Africa is because they live in fortified homes apart from the general black population, and have a reputation for armed defense and vigorous pursuit of justice.</p>
<p>If they lived undefended in the shantytowns, they&rsquo;d have been massacred long ago.    </p>

		<p>4 Anon: I&rsquo;m going to wonder if maybe the surviving Whites in SA are protected by thug chieftains, who recognize that without Whites, the White man&rsquo;s magic won&rsquo;t work.  There are historical precedents for that sort of thing.</p>

		<p>Canada is the &#8220;land of trusting fools&#8221; whenever so-called &#8220;refugees&#8221; comes knocking on our door with regurgitated sob stories that always have a ring of similarity to them. For the past 22 years there has been an estimated <b>700,000</b> &#8220;refugees&#8221; arriving on Canadian soil and most of those claims probably would have never been considered by any other refugee receiving country. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hardly any formal protest forthcoming from any organization&hellip; UNLESS the refugee claimant is U.S. army absconder or a White South African, such as in this case.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take MS-13 gangsters, 250,000 bogus Sri Lankan refugees, Chinese parents objecting to their country&rsquo;s 1 child policy, Iranian gays claiming discrimination, Sudanese rapists, and so forth, yet when ONE South African white man has the temerity to mount the mantle of refugee victimology, it seems all the heavy hitters come out swinging, as if on cue.  </p>

		<p>My wife and I and our four kids decided to go into exile in 2003 and came to the USA. Black on white crime is rampant in South Africa and thousands have been affected. No media is prepared to show the facts of fear of being called rasist. White on black crime is pretty much non existant. Yes - violant crime is color blind but in SA the whites do not attack each other or blacks. It is black on black and black on white. If you are a whitey in South Africa you are a target. It is terrible to live there and being in constant fear for your life. The West should airlift whites out of South Africa and make it easy for them to resettle in a Western county.</p>

		<p>In South Africa, there are many poor whites who also live in shanty towns, along with poor blacks, because they cannot afford to live in guarded communities.  An article in American Renaissance about the plight of poor whites in South Africa would be a good topic. </p>
<p>South African whites should be  granted asylum in the USA and Canada if they want to leave for their own safety.</p>
<p>Affrikaners are traditionally a brave and fighting people so I am sure at least some whites will boldly defend themselves in South Africa to the very end.</p>
<p>In the 1930&rsquo;s, Canada turned away desperate European Jews trying to flee Hitler with a policy of &#8220;None is too many.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Today, Canada is threatening to deport Brandon Huntley back to South Africa to face  a dangerous fate of possibly getting killed by black criminals and  having the local South African police look the other way.</p>

		<p>Perhaps they should ask the opinion of a previous Canadian ambassador to S.A. who was robbed and tasered in a secure luxury hotel. Or perhaps not, since the Canadian government refused  to make the facts known at the time for fear of hurting S.A.&rsquo;s image.</p>

<p>You are correct Ross, unless you happen to be as old and frail as the 77 year-old mother and her 57 year-old mentally retarded daughter who were murdered by two black men aged 21 and 19. The attack took place in March of this year within a block of the local police station.  But nobody heard their screams.  They were stripped and held down while both had their vaginas shredded with a broken bottle.  Then, while still alive, one of the victims had her breasts cut off, and their assailants then sat back to watch them die in agony from loss of blood.</p>
<p>Of course the liberal press did not report the details of the murder, so hardly anyone in South Africa knows the abovementioned details.  It is accordingly unlikely that the Canadian government will have come to hear of it either.  And if you think it all sounds rather far-fetched, read it for yourself at;</p>

		<p>Canada has such low standards of proof when it comes to evaluating the typical applicant for refugee status that I don&rsquo;t see an explanation of why they are subjecting the South African White&rsquo;s claim to a higher standard of proof than a Somali needs to show. The usual grounds for a non-White applicant are these:</p>
<p>To be granted asylum in Canada as a refugee, a person must be outside his or her home country and have a well-founded fear of persecution. According to the Geneva Convention, the fear must not only be well-founded, the persecution must also be based on reasons of race, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. However, a less restrictive interpretation of the feared persecution may also lead to refugee status. For example, Canada recognizes that women can be persecuted because of their gender and that the definition of a refugee should be interpreted to also include this form of persecution. A variety of circumstances can make a person a refugee. </p>
