<h1>Black Political Power Is Exaggerated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Curry, Afro, October 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The annual Self-Congratulation Political Weekend in Washington, D.C., formally known as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation&rsquo;s Annual Legislative Conference and informally known as CBC Weekend, is over.</p>
<p>But after a series of feel-good panel discussions, members of Congress darting in and out of rooms, and even a speech by President Barack Obama  &mdash;  with requisite non-stop partying thrown in for good measure  &mdash;  the true needs of most African Americans are no closer to becoming a reality than before Black political junkies descended on the nation&rsquo;s capital for the gathering.</p>
<p>To be fair, there is much to celebrate. The CBC has grown from 13 members when it was established in 1971 to 42 numbers, not counting &#8220;Dollar Bill&#8221; Jefferson, who is on his way to a federal prison.</p>
<p>House Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) is the third-ranking Democrat, four African Americans chair important House committees and 17 head subcommittees, and a former CBC member is now president of the United States.</p>
<p>However, before you start singing &#8220;Happy Days Are Here Again,&#8221; let&rsquo;s put things in perspective. When you add one African-American senator to the 42 House members, including two who can&rsquo;t vote except in committee, that&rsquo;s only 43 out of 535 members of the House and Senate, which is 8 percent.</p>
<p>It sounds good to say that the president is a former member of the CBC, though he wasn&rsquo;t all that active and never took on a leadership role in the caucus. But the sad truth is that for many reasons, including his need to be president of &#8220;all people,&#8221; Barack Obama is much more moderate than most members of the liberal Congressional Black Caucus. Consequently, he is more willing to make compromises that may, in the end, not serve the best interest of most African Americans.</p>
<p>That does not mean he isn&rsquo;t concerned about issues that are paramount to Blacks. Instead, that simply means that he is a politician doing what politicians do best  &mdash;  compromising.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But being sensitive and using the right language is no substitute for direct action. Having an African-American president and having a record number of Blacks holding leadership positions in Congress is meaningless if, in the end, they can&rsquo;t bring about real change for those who need it the most.</p>

		<p>Let me just say that the name of that newspaper is &#8220;Afro.&#8221; I imagine it might be beyond them to understand why blacks are suffering even while they have a disproportionate amount of their own in positions of political power. Jeez Louise. </p>

		<p>Roland Burris won&rsquo;t seek another term, and his replacement will very likely be white.  Deval Patrick is polling poorly in MA, the latest news on David Paterson is that the NY Dems want to push Rangel out before he faces a felony rap so that Paterson can slide in his seat, to open up D-GOV for Andrew Cuomo so that the Dems either win GOV or aren&rsquo;t landslided out by the Republican.  </p>
<p>The good news for the CBC is that Cold Cash&rsquo;s seat in Louisiana will soon be back in black hands.  Anh &#8220;Joseph&#8221; Cao is just a one time fluke b/c of Cold Cash; otherwise, the Cook Partisan Voting Index, which rates House districts on a scale from 1-30 whole units on either the Republican or Democrat side, shows that that district is D+29, the second highest possible intensity for Democrats; Cao&rsquo;s fluke win last year is the only reason it isn&rsquo;t D+30, which it was for quite some time.</p>
<p>A number of states that have large urban (black) centers will lose House seats after the 2010 census, and this might force state legislatures to gerrymander black and white liberal districts together, which means white libs win instead of blacks, further reducing CBC membership.</p>

<p>And the more participation by blacks in our government the more problems we have.</p>
<p>Congress has always comprised the worst of humanity in this country, but with the addition of blacks and mestizos it has dropped to a new low.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it will get far worse before it&rsquo;s all over.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want. They have the influence they demanded and what do they do with it? Throw self-congratulatory parties.</p>

Having an African-American president and having a record number of Blacks holding leadership positions in Congress is meaningless if, in the end, they can&rsquo;t bring about real change for those who need it the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just what kind of &ldquo;direct action&rdquo; would this Comrade Curry of the aptly titled &ldquo;Afro&rdquo; have all of them do, forcefully legislate that all whites be enslaved, and the Hispanics and Asians along with them?</p>
<p>The ignorance of blacks especially (but to be fair, the average Marxists in general public also) with regard to the constitutional limits of elected political power, is so astounding that it is almost incomprehensible. There seems to be no end to the absurd and debased demands of these imbecilic Red automatons, indicating that contempt is a wasted sentiment on them, since they are so far beneath its implied better qualities, that they utterly degrade the very essence of the word.  </p>
<p>Moreover, there are currently far vaster interests that now swirl into and chain down the constitutional limits of elected political power, than the authors of that document ever dreamed of; no matter how valiantly they attempted to correct for them and also, to warn against them. Laughably, the current state religion of Multiculturalism is one of them, but not the only one. So too, are the &ldquo;legislating&rdquo; courts and the corporate/media/military interests that most vociferously perpetuate the state religion that is but a nebulous pillar in that incestuous feedback square of perfidious debauchery. </p>
<p>In the end, the Reds and blacks already really have what they want, they are just too terminally stupid to see it. And ironically, when the whole sick edifice comes crumbling down, they will be the first to stammer out a childishly maudlin: &lsquo;Why, oh why.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask this idiot how many Whites are in leadership positions in Africa, Mexico, China or the Middle East! As usual, WHITES are the only ones required to share their wealth/power with others, even if they havent EARNED it.  To even suggest the sharing of power/wealth in non-White countries would be laughable to them, as it should be with us.</p>

		<p>Black politicians may hate Whites, but they definitely don&rsquo;t care about the average Black.  If they did, they&rsquo;d have forced their White liberal friends to address the costs of immigration, by calling them &#8220;racist&#8221; if they wouldn&rsquo;t face the topic.   </p>

		<p>These people have no idea how lucky they are living in a civilization created by whites.  If they were truly in control, this country would rapidly sink into African living standards.  That would be very scary.  Perhaps in the future, to be allowed into an advanced civilization, one&rsquo;s genetic make-up will have to be analyzed.  For anyone who is against this idea, they can continue to live in a society infested with crime, poverty, laziness, mayhem, wasted tax money, etc.    </p>

		<p>Of the course the only way a Black politician could really help his fellow Blacks, would be to run as an immigration restriction candidate, but that would require putting the interests of poor Blacks over middle class AA Blacks like the Obamas.</p>

		<p>What the Black community fails to understand is, their Black leaders are out for their own interests and the Black leadership is little more than white liberal lapdogs. To make matters worse for Blacks, the white liberals are selling the Black leadership down the river to be replaced by the Hispanic leadership.</p>
<p>Face it this is little more than Black on Black crime the way the Black leadership treats their own people.</p>

		<p>Silly me, I thought when I read the headline of this article, that it would be a cause for some serious soul searching on the part of the writer as to whether the concept of blacks in power was not somehow overrated. After all, the city of Washington DC itself is run almost entirely by blacks, and look what a mess it is. Of course I was wrong! The upshot of this whole article by a black writer is that the only reason black leadership has failed is that blacks still don&rsquo;t have enough power! As we all know, no amount of power will ever be &#8220;enough.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have a news flash for Mr. Curry. If black political power is exaggerated, so are black accomplishments. Accomplishments by blacks could probably fit on a postage stamp sized pamphlet. The effects of black political power however can be seen in places like Detroit and New Orleans.</p>

<p>Ah, here we go again!  Curry&rsquo;s real gripe is that blacks don&rsquo;t hold supreme power and he is obviously under the mistaken impression that they&rsquo;re entitled to.</p>
<p>Firstly, blacks did not found America, Whites did.  Whites were in North America before blacks and for both these reasons have an exclusive claim to North America.  In fact, blacks have none whatsoever, regardless of their being there for only four hundred years or thereabouts.  Whites have been there considerably longer than them.</p>
<p>Secondly, the black population as a whole makes up about 20% or less of the US population, yet another reason why they&rsquo;re not entitled to representation, let alone further increased representation in White founded North America. </p>
<p>To summarize, in common with the opposite views of both African AND diaspora blacks regarding the White presence on the African continent, blacks are not entitled to even be in White homelands in the first place.</p>
