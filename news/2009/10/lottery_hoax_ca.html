<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20091015/D9BB7CGG1.html">Lottery Hoax Causes Riot at Ohio Coat Store</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meghan Barr, AP, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Linda Brown was arrested Tuesday after an hours-long shopping spree that began when she hired a stretch Hummer limousine to drop her off at a Burlington Coat Factory store, police Sgt. Lt. Michael Deakins said. Brown walked to a cash register and loudly announced she had won the lottery and would pay for each person&rsquo;s merchandise up to $500, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People flooded the registers as cashiers began ringing up purchase after purchase, but Brown had not yet paid the bill, Deakins said. At least 500 people filled the aisles and another 1,000 were outside trying to get in, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was telling people she won $1.5 million,&#8221; Deakins said. &#8220;But it ends up she didn&rsquo;t win anything. She had no money to pay for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>About an hour later, Brown had the limousine driver take her to a bank to withdraw money, but she returned empty-handed, police Detective Steven Nace said. By then, store employees had called in two dozen police officers to handle the crowds.</p>
<p>Shopper Candace Jordan said she told Brown she didn&rsquo;t need clothes, she needed help paying her rent.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she said, &#8216;How much is it?&rsquo;&#8221; Jordan told WBNS-TV. &#8220;And she promptly wrote out a check.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time employees realized Brown didn&rsquo;t have any cash to pay, police said, she already had taken off in the limo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when angry customers, realizing they weren&rsquo;t getting free coats, began throwing merchandise on the floor and grabbing clothes without paying for them, Nace said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody was like, &#8216;I still want my free stuff,&rsquo; and that started the riot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It looks like (Hurricane) Katrina went through the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said they have no way of tracking down the customers who stole items and fled, but they&rsquo;re reviewing surveillance video.</p>
<p>When the limousine driver realized he wasn&rsquo;t going to be paid the $900 Brown owed him for the day&rsquo;s rental, he turned her in to police, Deakins said.</p>
<p>Brown, 44, was arrested on three outstanding warrants for aggravated menacing, misuse of a 911 system and causing false alarms. She was jailed late Wednesday, but no charges had been filed against her related to the coat store chaos pending a mental health evaluation.</p>

		<p>Thirty years of bartending taught me to smell a rat any time someone offered to pay for something of a strangers, especially on such a large scale. The second instant realization is that by Lotto standards $1.5 million is peanuts&hellip; Just about enough to make you wish you had won $4.0 million instead. Not enough to spend on relatives, much less relative strangers. Lastly I blame the store management for letting it get out of hand. They should have quickly told the woman to hush, knowing it would start a free for all. If it was me I would have isolated the woman in the office  and then verified her story,(Show me $127,000 in cash) and it would have ended right there. The two times some one bought a round for the house in my own case was 1.) a guy bought drinks for about thirty people for about $150.00 and 2.) a man started shouting free drinks for all on a band night with around 300 people inside. I grabbed the guy by the collar and told him, &#8220;Mister, You just shouted fire in a theatre!! Quit!!&#8221; In response he handed me two thousand dollars in cash and asked if that was enough to get things going&hellip; I told him, &#8220;Lemme start with yours.&#8221; His tab came to a little over $1800.00 with tips for the girls serving. The  funny thing was the guy was in his early twenties which I thought was unusual, and the only explanation offered was that he had just closed &#8220;the deal of a lifetime&#8221;.</p>

When the crowd became hostile and started busting up the store and helping themselves to the five- finger discounts somthing in my head just screamed out majority minority.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly white department store shoppers just don&rsquo;t respond that way,- at least not in America. </p>

		<p> My, my   &mdash;   nary a hint of anyone&rsquo;s race in this story. Bet they were all Swedish-Americans, down to Ohio from Minnesota to stock up for St. Lucia&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p> Come on, fellow readers   &mdash;   we all know they were black   &mdash;   the charlatan who caused the ruckus, and the people who all took a &#8220;five-fingered discount&#8221; when they learned the &#8220;lottery winner&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t pay for a cup of coffee, let alone all that swag.</p>
<p> When I first heard the cable TV headline, &#8220;Riot in Columbus, Ohio store,&#8221; I could guess, if not who or what caused it, then what shade the rioters were. Wish they&rsquo;d shown some photos   &mdash;   maybe frame grabs from the store&rsquo;s surveillance video. When the national news media reports very carefully on an incident like this, we all know why.</p>

		<p>The analogy to Katrina in the story is spot on.  That is exactly how blacks act, everywhere, everytime.  Last one I heard was free Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Guaranteed to cause a riot, and it did. Especially when the place ran out of chicken.  Two generations or more having been  raised on handouts, now they expect it and murder, loot, riot and run amok when they don&rsquo;t get it whatever it is you have that they want.</p>

		<p>When someone offers to buy 1000+ costumers &#8216;everything for everyone&rsquo; you need not to have exceptional wit to see there must be something wrong. It&rsquo;s obvious someone must be lying or a lunatic-even if he or she won the lottery. The hilarious part when it turn out to be nothing for no one. Yet, they turn to rioting in order to get their boon.</p>

		<p>Is there anyone out there who didn&rsquo;t read this story, including the fact that the store patrons &#8220;still wanted their &#8216;free&rsquo; stuff&#8221; and how they started running out of the store with stolen merchandise, and didn&rsquo;t immediately know that when the video was played, the faces would all be dark?</p>

<p>Um even HAD won, 1500 people each getting $500 dollars almounts to $750,000, in other words that would probably exceed her actual &#8220;$1.5 million&#8221; since the lotto generally pays out a mere 30 or 40 percent or so if you take it in a lump sum rather than through a stretched out decades long payout  &mdash;   and that is BEFORE you get raped by the IRS.<br>

		<p>As soon as I heard &#8220;Burlington Coat Factory&#8221;, &#8220;free&#8221;, and &#8220;riot&#8221; this morning, I knew it had to be blacks. (See also: the frequent disturbances at Chuck E. Cheese franchises.) </p>
<p>This is a logical outcome of what happens when a group of people get accustomed to receiving anything and everything for free, without effort. They don&rsquo;t just have the IQ&rsquo;s of children, they have the dependent mentality of children as well. Give them what they want, or they throw a tantrum. Why is it that people all across the political spectrum can accept that government subsidies make for fat, lazy, incompetent corporations (US carmakers), but it is heresy to say that government subsidies have the same effect on individuals?</p>

		<p>Hahahahaha, priceless!  Too funny, To have mentioned race in the reporting of this hilarious incident would have been redundant. If Afro-Americans have a cultural pastime its got to be the art of looting.  Anytime there is civil disturbance or disaster resulting in interruption of basic services i.e. law enforcement if it isn&rsquo;t bolted,nailed, or welded down its getting looted.<br>
 Examples Rodney King riots, Katrina etc, etc.  I have images of S. Korean store owners with deer rifles going thru my head right about now. </p>

		<p>How come we never hear of this kind of thing happening in all or mostly white  places? Could it be that whites are a little too &hellip; oh, I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; civilized &hellip; for these shenanigans? Oh wait, let me guess, this is some of the exciting color and diversity white areas are so lacking in and must be subjected to.</p>

		<p>The Long Island Walmart last Christmas, the $ 3,000 &#8220;giveaway&#8221; in Detroit and now this in Columbus, OH. Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think these people in Columbus were Albanian Ghegs.</p>
<p>Bantu greediness is readily apparent, not only in this episode, but also in phony gun &#8220;buy-back&#8221; programs where they&rsquo;ll turn in their guns for $ 50 cash, OR a gift card from a department store. Or, police have used ads promising free football or basketball tickets to the first 50 or 100 people to show up at a designated locale. They&rsquo;ll do this to catch fugitives and other criminals.</p>
<p>Give Bantus enough rope and they&rsquo;ll hang themselves. </p>
