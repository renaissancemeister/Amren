<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9BBNUJ80&amp;show_article=1">Interracial Couple Denied Marriage License in La.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Breitbart, October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Louisiana justice of the peace said he refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple out of concern for any children the couple might have.</p>
<p>Keith Bardwell, justice of the peace in Tangipahoa Parish, says it is his experience that most interracial marriages do not last long.</p>
<p>{snip} But Bardwell told the Daily Star of Hammond that he was not a racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house,&#8221; Bardwell said. &#8220;My main concern is for the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bardwell said he has discussed the topic with blacks and whites, along with witnessing some interracial marriages. He came to the conclusion that most of black society does not readily accept offspring of such relationships, and neither does white society, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t do interracial marriages because I don&rsquo;t want to put children in a situation they didn&rsquo;t bring on themselves,&#8221; Bardwell said. &#8220;In my heart, I feel the children will later suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he does an interracial marriage for one couple, he must do the same for all, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to treat everyone equally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thirty-year-old Beth Humphrey and 32-year-old Terence McKay, both of Hammond, say they will consult the U.S. Justice Department about filing a discrimination complaint.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really astonishing and disappointing to see this come up in 2009,&#8221; said American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana attorney Katie Schwartzman. &#8220;The Supreme Court ruled as far back as 1963 that the government cannot tell people who they can and cannot marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ACLU was preparing a letter for the Louisiana Supreme Court, which oversees the state justices of the peace, asking them to investigate Bardwell and see if they can remove him from office, Schwartzman said.</p>

		<p>Ironically, Louisiana was once considered the miscegenation capital of America.  While LA does not have the highest percentage of black residents (that &#8220;honor&#8221; belongs to MS), it does have the highest percentage of black voters.  The reason is that many of LA&rsquo;s blacks are mulattoes.</p>

		<p>This judge is right - if he does weddings for black/black and white/white couples, then what he&rsquo;s objecting to is the creation of households where the children are of no particular race. This means that he&rsquo;s not discriminating against any race, but on the contrary, protecting both races represented in the relationhship.</p>
<p>Of course, the couple could (and may very well) simply go off and shack up. No state government actually enforces its marriage laws, anyway.</p>

		<p>&#8220;JP says neither blacks nor whites &ldquo;readily accept&rdquo; the children of miscegenation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right, of course, which makes for a miserable life for a kid, but have you ever known a nutty leftist whacko who didn&rsquo;t lie to himself/herself about what the real world will accept or reject?</p>

		<p>What does it matter?  You don&rsquo;t need a marriage license to have children   &mdash;   obviously!  This justice seems to be making his decision based on long obsolete social conventions that went out the door with the Great Society programs of the 60s, i.e., that couples marry with the intent to bear children, and that it is severely stigmatizing to have children out of wedlock.  </p>
<p>This couple&rsquo;s choice to have children is only restrained to the extent that they subscribe to this social convention.  Given that blacks have an illegitimacy rate of over 70%, it is pretty clear that the notion of &#8220;illegitimacy&#8221; itself as a term with negative connotations is no longer applicable to blacks.  Very likely it doesn&rsquo;t have much relevance to this interracial couple, either, for whom marriage may represent something else entirely.</p>

		<p>Most American blacks are so racially diluted with white blood mainly via lascivious white women to the point they are no longer phenotypically black and can&rsquo;t even be compared to Africans.  At this point, the best we can hope for is that such females dilute away the black race entirely.</p>

<p>I have to admit I&rsquo;m puzzled by these comments.  What &#8220;marriage law&#8221; is there to enforce against two unmarried people cohabiting / sleeping together?  If they&rsquo;re unmarried, how could it be adultery?  Any law that criminalized unmarried people for engaging in consensual sexual relationships would be unconstitutional (and absurd on its face by criminalizing 96% of the US population). </p>

		<p>Uniculturalist, you raise a valid concern. Liberals seem to want the whole world to become one mulatto race. At the same time they praise diversity. There&rsquo;s a disconnect. If they really wanted diversity, they would express the same concern as you did, Uniculturalist, about miscegenation.</p>

		<p>The JP is right, of course.  </p>
<p>1.  Such parents saddle their children with a burden they didn&rsquo;t have to bear themselves.</p>
<p>2.  Parents cannot truly relate to the child&rsquo;s experiences as a mixed-race person.</p>
<p>3.  Child suffers identity issues.</p>
<p>4.  Not easy to find marrow donors for mixed race people.</p>
<p>5.  From a White person&rsquo;s perspective, you&rsquo;ve just denied existence to a White child.</p>
<p>6.  Interracial marriages DO end in divorce more often than same-race marriages.  Bad for the kids.</p>

		<p>As everyone knows, a &#8216;license&rsquo; allows one to engage in an activity that is unlawful/illegal.</p>
<p>It is or was against the law in many states for one to marry outside ones race.</p>
<p>To marry is a natural right of all men and women.  No license required.  But to marry outside ones race became allowed if one could find a place that would give him/her a license to do so.  Hence, the creation of the &#8216;Marriage License&rsquo;.  I believe it is a fairly new concept.  It started in the early 20th Century?  The custom of recording ones marriage in a public entity began in the 19th Century, I believe.  Prior to that, recordings took place in church records, parish records, family bibles and the like.  Once the deed was done, the couple merely presented themselves to the public and announced that they were man and wife.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to attack the above statements, please feel free to do so.  Offer proof, please.  To assert that a white man and a white woman cannot marry without a license   &mdash;   ie that white to white marriage is illegal   &mdash;   is a fraud.</p>

		<p>I would be standing on rock solid ground, if I were to point out that in nearly every case, off-spring from an unnatural union of white and black will not only be physically more black looking, but they also will identify more closely with the black half of their ethnic makeup than the white portion.</p>
<p>Obama is a perfect example of this situation.  So, in essence, any mixture of white and black blood will always be a net loss for the white race, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Could this be why our anti-white media promote this genocide on the white race?   I think so.</p>

		<p>Kuddos to the judge but it is obvious that Beth Humphrey is a lost woman.  Her soul is black.  More sickening is the response at the &#8220;conservative&#8221; web site called Free Republic where little Republican yuppies are beside themselves in horror at the judge&rsquo;s actions.  Beth Humphrey is dead as a white person and whatever children she bears will be black.  The big problem is the attitude of white &#8220;conservatives&#8221; at Free Republic, not the lost white woman.</p>

		<p>I doubt the JP was within his legal rights, but could not agree more with his thinking. Mixed-race couples fill me personally with utter disgust. As do their mixed-race children.</p>
<p>Went to the local W-M the other day. Saw a White female with a half-breed child. Predictably the female was gross. Seems the majority of White females having sex with Blacks appear to be slatternly women, often grossly overweight and of disgusting appearance. Or is this only my subjective impression?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that interracial couples couldn&rsquo;t at least be required to sign a fully informed consent to the effect that both of them understand that their offspring will have a high probability of lower IQ and greater impulsive character than possessed by the parent of European descent. Their children will not likely become rocket scientists or anything close, and the child&rsquo;s propensity for crime and deviant behavior are greater. The White mom should not annoy or disrupt schools because her hybrid children don&rsquo;t do well in the classroom since she should expect such consequences resulting from her poor decision.</p>

		<p>I am white, and have a dirtbag brother who decided to have 3 children with a black woman, and 1 with a Mexican woman. For some reason he embraced the black culture. Really no surprise, he went to school durring the height of bussing and was fully educated in &#8220;white-guilt&#8221;. I was in the military at the time, so I had no influance on him. All I can say is he is a typical &#8220;baby daddy&#8221;. He is an absentee father who contributes nothing to the kids. They will have such a hard life. My child is light years ahead of all of his kids. I have not spoken to him in 6 years now. Not so much because he likes blacks, but because he is a dirtbag father, and nothing pisses me off mpore than a father who wont care for their kids. </p>

<p>&#8220;Humphrey, an account manager for a marketing firm, said she and McKay, a welder, just returned to Louisiana. She is white and he is black. She plans to enroll in the University of New Orleans to pursue a masters degree in minority politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, I believe this was a set up and there is an agenda; think<br>
Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>@ 14 P.Norman<br>
I think you are right. I have known preacher&rsquo;s that refuse to marry couples for various reasons; Prior marriage/divorce, <br>
differing values, or feel it is a bad match.<br>
My husband and I had to have 3 meetings with the gentleman<br>
who married us. He required this and told us up front that<br>
He would tell us after the meetings if he would marry us.<br>
So,What is the difference between this and what Mr.Bardwell<br>
is doing?<br>

		<p>&ldquo;No state government actually enforces its marriage laws, anyway&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adultery&hellip; is not even considered a crime anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have to admit I&rsquo;m puzzled by these comments. What &ldquo;marriage law&rdquo; is there to enforce against two unmarried people cohabiting / sleeping together? If they&rsquo;re unmarried, how could it be adultery? Any law that criminalized unmarried people for engaging in consensual sexual relationships would be unconstitutional (and absurd on its face by criminalizing 96% of the US population). </p>
<p>Although these considerations are probably moot, the fact is that under the Constitution, the States are governments of general powers, among which the morals, safety, health and welfare of the citizenry are numbered. Thus until recent years, the States have had nearly complete power to define and regulate marriage. Both fornication and adultery could be punished at common law (as a matter of fact, Idaho tried to enforce a fornication law just a few years ago).</p>
<p>Nowadays, by contrast, the authorities overlook such activities unless they occur among a disapproved group. Consequently, white Mormon polygamists out in the southwestern desert minding their own business are arrested and either sent to prison (as happened in the Green case in Utah a few years back)or have their lives ruined (as happened in west Texas very recently), to say nothing of the devastation caused to their wives and children, who are nearly always decent, law-abiding citizens. </p>
<p>On the other hand, &#8220;serial polygamists,&#8221; who sleep around with other women while either married or cohabiting, and who in all likelihood are mooching off the government, are OK as long as they don&rsquo;t engage in any actual abuse other than arranging for the women in their lives to have abortions.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t think polygamy is the ideal social arrangement, I&rsquo;d much prefer to leave the polygamists alone and go after the real degenerates who destroy the lives of others with whom they have relationships. Interracial relationships, whether within lawful wedlock or not, certainly tend toward the latter.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m Black and I applaud this man&rsquo;s actions. I believe that miscegenation and race-mixing is bad for Blacks and non-Blacks. Few people will accept such unions and our genetics seem to dominate, thus the child cannot claim the other race as well. </p>
<p>Also, it causes Black people to feel lowly about ourselves when we cannot match with the other races (for example, other races have a field day with Asian women, but Blacks cannot; the solution is not to force Asian women to like Blacks, but for Blacks to avoid Asians as both sides will be much happier in the long run). I am an advocate of geographical racial separation, and although I&rsquo;d probably be laughed off of the &#8220;Internets&#8221;, I believe that we could do better as a race without international aid, imposing our own laws to clean up our race, and we must also stop trying to fit in where we don&rsquo;t belong (no pun intended).</p>

<p>As I noted here on the 13th, it&rsquo;s legal <a href="https://joi.org/bloglinks/Jewish-disinherit.htm" rel="nofollow">(at least in Illinois)</a> to disinherit a child who marries outside his/her faith. Parents who share Fed Up&rsquo;s views should place similar language in their wills cutting off any child who marries a nonwhite. </p>

		<p>The fallout for Judge Bardwell has started. Here&rsquo;s one example, appearing on Yahoo News, from the Associated Press.  I&rsquo;d like for someone to tell me if the title makes sense:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many angry man wouldn&rsquo;t marry interracial couple&#8221; (sic)</p>
<p>I could comment on the above, but I&rsquo;ll try to be nice this time and leave that one alone.  I would post a link, but I&rsquo;m not sure how long the link would be good.  Judge Bardwell might as well get ready for a major attack from the liberal commie pinkos and from &#8220;Republican yuppies&#8221;, as pointed out above by Captain Jack Aubrey.  They will attempt to crucify the Judge for abiding by his conscience and good sense. <br>

		<p>To letter #19 who said it seems the majority of white women who have sex with black men are fat and &#8220;of discusting appearance&#8221; I&rsquo;d have to say that the majority of white women I see with black men are at least average looking.<br>
The best way to combat this black/white mating thing is to understand it so tactics can be employed to attack the root cause. <br>
White groups should commission a psychological study where they interview 1000&rsquo;s of white women to find out why they paired up with black men. </p>

		<p>I hate to disappoint my fellow pro-White and anti-miscegenation race-realists, but most people in America are not on our side despite this comment &ldquo;JP says neither blacks nor whites &ldquo;readily accept&rdquo; the children of miscegenation.&rdquo; I just saw a segment on CNN with almost unanimous consent approving of neutrality on miscegenation with comments like&hellip; I can&rsquo;t believe we can&rsquo;t get past race. This is utterly sickening. Nobody wants to seem to recognize how utterly immoral action(because of the heavy risk and negative consequences) that interracial marriage causes. I suggest everyone have your best comments on various message boards and forums and spread your opinions around for people to read.</p>

		<p>This story was posted at NOLA.COM, and the comments that followed were patently absurd, for the most part.</p>
<p>I posted the following comment to the website, which was subsequently removed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, JP Bardwell should be given a civic award for Good Citizenship. <br>
It seems as if he is guided only by what he perceives is best for the children,race notwithstanding.<br>
Of course, the many ridiculous comments on this site are posted by ignoramuses who are the real racists, projecting onto others what they are themselves. Their comments are as laughable as they are predictable.<br>
And further, to use the mulatto Obama as an example for race-mixing, goes to show  exactly the kind of twisted thinking these people employ. You see, Obama is a perfect example of why miscegenates should NOT be allowed to have children, fools!&rdquo;<br>

		<p><i>&#8220;And don&rsquo;t get me started on White man / Asian female relationships. If you engage in that behavior, you should be excluded from the community and not even vaguely be considered a White Nationalist at all. Get it straight.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>GOOD. You are not a hypocrite.</p>
<p>But I hardly see many of your fellow white nationalists feeling the same way. Mostly white guys with Asian women get a free ride here.</p>

		<p>It looks like I have been barred from posting on NOLA.COM. <br>
This is what I have to say:</p>
<p>Stand strong, JP Bardwell.<br>
You are an inspiration to us all who are sick and tired of the immorality on display in this country.<br>
More people support you than you think, and all the personal smears from the losers on this site (nola.com) are only going to increase your support.<br>
Good for you, Mr. Bardwell, for having the courage of your convictions.<br>

		<p>This judge seems very outdated. Nobody has to be married to have children and this couple may well already have children.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many pro-miscegenationists realize that their reasoning to coerce any justice of the peace to administer interracial marriages also applies to forcing a JP to administer homosexual marriages as well? I&rsquo;m sure that many lefty liberals could care less, but if they take their religion seriously they would. </p>

		<p>Sorry I think the judge was wrong in all counts and here is why, they wanted to be united and have a marriage nothing is stopping them from reproducing without a marriage license, they want to be together as a couple. Second this is directed at factualist not only are your statistics wrong, but it shows how people beilve anything they hear. Intelligence is not associated to any one race, in fact race is such a small, tiny amount of your genetic make up that you as white are more similar to a black man because you are both A positive then to a white man who is 0 negative. So having children would be just the same as any of the same race. Also behavior in school would not go down unless the parents taught them so. So again it could go with any race. </p>
