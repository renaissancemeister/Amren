<h1>Hispanic Caucus Calls for Ending Program That Identified 100,000 Illegal Aliens, Many With Criminal Records</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, CNS News, October 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked the Obama administration to &#8220;immediately terminate&#8221; a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) program that has identified more than 120,000 illegal aliens over the past three years..</p>
<p>&#8220;On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), we write to ask that you immediately terminate all Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) under the 287(g) program and cease to establish such agreements,&#8221; reads the letter to President Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;These agreements are the subject of serious concern as local law enforcement agencies have used the new powers to target communities of color, including a disproportionate number of Latinos, for arrest,&#8221; says the letter. &#8220;The 287(g) program, which was significantly expanded throughout the Bush Administration, relinquishes the power to enforce federal immigration laws to local law enforcement and corrections agencies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The misuse of the 287(g) program by its current participants has rendered it ineffective and dangerous to community safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sept. 28 letter is signed by caucus leaders Reps. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.).</p>
<p>The letter cites a March 2009 Government Accountability Office report that &#8220;found alarming examples of mismanagement and insufficient oversight of this controversial program.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said 287(g) has undergone a &#8220;sea change&#8221; since the &#8220;standardization&#8221; of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was announced by Secretary Janet Napolitano in July, and that the changes were designed to make the program more accountable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus says state and local law enforcement &#8220;use their expanded and often unchecked powers under the 287(g) program to target immigrants and persons of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our opinion that no amount of reforms, no matter how well-intended, will change this disturbing reality,&#8221; the letter states.</p>
<p>CNSNews.com sent inquiries by e-mail and telephone to Reps. Gutierrez and Velazquez to explain how federal immigration law could be better enforced in the United States if the 287(g) is eliminated. The representatives were also asked to comment on the success of the program, which since January 2007 has identified more than 120,000 individuals as &#8220;potentially removable aliens,&#8221; most of whom are incarcerated in local jails, according to DHS.</p>

		<p>This is the same two-faced CHC that was apparently okay with &#8220;deporting&#8221; (i.e. a judge asks an illegal alien who has committed one or more violent or serious crimes pretty please with a cherry on top to go home; any resemblance to that and their actually returning to their country of origin is purely a coincidence), &#8220;criminal&#8221; illegal aliens (like being here illegally isn&rsquo;t a crime), just so long as we passed amnesty for everyone else.</p>
<p>Now we see they were phony about that &#8220;concession&#8221; as well.</p>

		<p>You gotta love Rep. Luis Guiterez.  He represents his race very well.  In fact he represents them better than his white constituents.  In fact Guiterez would rather help and illegal alien who has been in the country for two days than a white citzen who has been here 7 generations.  If that is not the defination of a racist, what is?</p>

		<p>  &#8220;for the race everything&#8221;. I just wish it was referring to the white race. Today it is, &#8220;for the white race, nothing&#8221;. Whites of all social status are beginning to feel disenfranchised in their own countries all over the world. At least the white russian youth are making a statement in their country. They seem to be the only ones other than a few eastern European countries that are doing anything about the huge numbers of aliens pouring across their borders. Sometimes the only way to get someone&rsquo;s attention, is with acts of violence. Alot of people here at AmRen will most likely disagree with me, but it is true. Sometimes talking achieves nothing. Actions truly speak louder than words.</p>

		<p>And what is the end game that these Mexican congresspeople are working toward here? </p>
<p>The dissolution of the sovereignty of the United States into a North American Union where Whites are the minority and Mexicans are the majority. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening here in the South West and coming to a neighborhood near you if the plans of these socialist leftists are not stopped.</p>

		<p>Another one of those articles that makes my blood boil. If more sleeping whites in America don&rsquo;t wake up and take our Country back, these people and groups will get their way. It amazes me how they expact us to just roll over and allow them to take over without a peep from us. They are getting bolder by the hour,and so should our protests.</p>

		<p>Does one dare to think that whites will have the courage to say no way, jose?  The more you give in, the more they will want.  If you keep saying no and hold your ground, they will eventually get the message and hopefully go away.  But unfortunately, this country has lost it integrity, purpose, and moral compass long ago.  And these intruders smell weaknes.  How contradicting that this country is suppose to be a super power but yet cannot even protect its own borders from illegal intruders.  Now they even dare to put up demands because they are allowed to belive they can just take.  This country plays a very dangerous game in losing everything that past generations have fought for.  How very sad.  <br>

		<p> These illegal aliens know that the media is on their side. Any American patriot knows that the media is against them. That&rsquo;s why the pro illegal alien jerks are winning. It all goes back to the media. If the media was against illegal aliens, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any. These media people want an entirely different America. One where whites aren&rsquo;t dominant.</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why people like Reps. Gutierrez and Velazquez hate the Hispanic community? Lets face it, the illegal immigrant criminals are not preying on rich white gated communities.  They are raping, killing, robbing Hispanic people from their own communities. </p>
<p>The same thing could be said for other minorities. If cities that have the most Blacks, have the highest crime rates, then who are their victims, if there are few whites around?</p>

In San Fransicksko last night, there was a meeting with the board of Stuporvisors about passing a resolution that would do in the city the same thing.Mayor Nusance opposes it, but 8 out of 11 stuporvisors supports it. Apparently they have forgotten, or just dont care about what happened to the Bolognas.An illegal should be reported to ICE if they are convicted or not, or even if they are only detained. </p>

		<p>Actually they are hoosier. As they flood in they setup gangs and organized criminal groups tearing apart good schools and neighborhoods with their gangs and low academic performance which negatively affects the social lives and academic performance of urban and suburban white kids, commit robberies, sell drugs, engage in assaults, spread their gang ideologies and culture to suburbia, etc&hellip; flooding prisons and the social safety net which cost taxpayers a fortune in so many ways. I&rsquo;ve seen it all first hand for decades here in LA. </p>
<p>And most whites aren&rsquo;t super rich living in gated communities. That&rsquo;s another fallacy you picked up.</p>
