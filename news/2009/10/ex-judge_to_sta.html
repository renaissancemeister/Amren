<h1><a href="https://news.aol.com/article/herman-thomas-accused-of-gay-sex-with/702052">Ex-Judge to Stand Trial on Sex Charges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phillip Rawls, AOL News, October 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Herman Thomas had an enviable political record as a black Democrat elected and re-elected in a county overwhelmingly white and increasingly Republican. The respected circuit judge once was the Democratic Party&rsquo;s choice to be the first black federal judge in south Alabama.</p>
<p>Then his career collapsed under allegations that he brought inmates to his office and spanked them with a paddle. Later, an indictment accused him of sexually abusing male inmates in exchange for leniency. The trial on charges of sodomy, kidnapping, sex abuse, extortion, assault and ethics violations is set to start Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case has shocked his friends and former colleagues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} If convicted of the most serious charges  &mdash;  sodomy and kidnapping  &mdash;  he faces from 20 years to life in prison.</p>
<p>The oldest incident in the charges dates to 1999, his first year as a circuit judge. The first public claim against Thomas surfaced in lawsuits filed by an inmate in 2001 in Mobile circuit court and in federal court that claimed the judge offered to help him with his case in return for sex. Both lawsuits were dismissed, and Thomas&rsquo; reputation remained unblemished.</p>
<p>Chief Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson said authorities began looking at Thomas after he changed a jail sentence in 2006 for his cousin, former Mobile County school commissioner David Thomas, even though the case was being handled by another judge. Other cases that Thomas had taken over from other judges without their approval soon surfaced, she said.</p>
<p>Some inmates in those cases described being checked out of the jail for meetings with Thomas in his car or in his private office in the county courthouse. First, there were reports of inmates having to pull down their underwear for spankings with a wooden paddle. Then came allegations of oral and anal sex, according to court records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense attorney Robert &#8220;Cowboy Bob&#8221; Clark calls the accusers &#8220;lying felons&#8221; who are trying to wreck the career of &#8220;a prestigious member of the Bar for over 20 years.&#8221; The NAACP has defended Thomas and claims race is behind his prosecution.</p>
<p>But Patterson disputes that, noting that each of the victims is black, and says that jail checkout records back up inmates&rsquo; claims about trips to Thomas&rsquo; private office, and other inmates spotted marks after paddlings. There also is other evidence, according to court records, including one inmate&rsquo;s seminal fluid on the office carpet. The inmates also were able to describe in detail Thomas&rsquo; unmarked windowless office.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say they have 15 current and former male inmates lined up to testify in a trial that could take several weeks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His attorney called the indictment &#8220;a high-tech lynching&#8221; by some in power in Mobile. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t like uppity black folks, and that&rsquo;s what they consider Herman,&#8221; Clark said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1997, Alabama&rsquo;s presidential advisory committee recommended President Bill Clinton appoint Thomas as the first black federal judge in the southern district of Alabama. The nomination was never acted on after Thomas failed to get the American Bar Association&rsquo;s top rating and amid some squabbling within the party.</p>

		<p>This is clearly a case of racial bias generated by the vast right wing conspiracy. President Obama probably had this outstanding jurist on a short list for a possible future appointment to the US Supreme Court.</p>

		<p>I know for a fact that interracial sex and rape takes place in prisons. I have seen large Black men take advantage of White inmates and large white inmates take advantage of black inmates. </p>
<p>However, I have never heard of a judge (of any race) involved in such behavior. To be honest, something sounds fishy here. I guess we will find out soon enough. </p>

		<p>If it were only a matter of the paddle (and for the sake of punishment, not for those other means), I wouldn&rsquo;t have much of a problem with this judge.  Methinks this judge saw a lot of black defendants, so he might know the time of day.</p>
<p>I have observed that in spite of the lip service opposition that blacks give (or gave) to systems such as segregation, Jim Crow and apartheid, blacks who gain power over other blacks wind up implementing most of it and they do it under the name of racial equality.</p>

		<p>I am mildly curious as to this judges application of relief for sex.</p>
<p>If defendents consented, did black consenters have more time cut off their proposed sentence, or did white consenters have more time cut off?  Was the amount of time cut uniform?  Was it equal?</p>
<p>I imagine   &mdash;   gee, I don&rsquo;t know why   &mdash;   that black defendents gained more time off than white defendents.  And we are yet to hear from defendents   &mdash;   white or black   &mdash;   that consented to sex and then had NO time cut off their sentence.  If you are double-crossed by the judge, to whom does one appeal?  Gee, thats never happened in an American courtroom.</p>

		<p>black and gay? And he is not the jurist of the year? Plus he&rsquo;s keeping young black men out of jail. This is a saint, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe he&rsquo;ll marry one of the lucky contestants and the President will attend the &#8216;wedding&rsquo;.</p>

Very true I grew up in the poor black section of Fort Pierce and I saw alot of chaos in my day. Alot of fights and alot of gangs that the parents simply didnt care about until their children were in a orange jump suit or a casket. Luckly I knew how to fight and nobody messed with me.</p>
<p>I moved into a more affluent black area and I was shocked to find two parent households and well disiplined children. Low crime and safe neighborhoods. This just goes to show what a little displine and order could do for these people</p>

		<p>Fifty plus years ago when anything surfaced involving a certain ethinicity it was dismissed as &#8220;just one of those colored things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same should be done now with alarming sound reasoning.  View the world of sports and the scandals, the criminals, the domestic violence, and endless sexual challenges, and you shoud deduct, &#8220;just one of those colored things.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one will ever learn&hellip;will they?  Especially that special ethnicity causing all the mahem.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The more serious crime of sodomy &hellip;.&#8221;.  Dear God.  Get this bow-tie blow hard out of office. With all the sex he wants with inmates the jail will suit him just fine.  Don&rsquo;t forget the paddle!! </p>
