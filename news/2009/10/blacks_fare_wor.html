<h1><a href="http://www.healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=631014">Blacks Fare Worse After Cardiac Arrest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Reinberg, HealthDay, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital are much less likely to survive than white patients, a new study finds.</p>
<p>Most of this disparity appears to result from the hospital in which black patients receive care, although other factors play a role as well, the researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that survival after having a cardiac arrest in the hospital setting has always been historically low,&#8221; said lead researcher Dr. Paul S. Chan, a cardiologist at St. Luke&rsquo;s Mid-America Heart Institute in Kansas City. &#8220;The rate of survival has been about 30 to 33 percent on average.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the survival rates for blacks were significantly lower, 25 percent vs. 37 percent for whites, Chan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This 12 percent absolute difference in survival is larger than any survival I can think of in terms of a racial disparity, in any other medical condition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The report is published in the Sept. 16 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lower rates of survival to hospital discharge for blacks reflected lower rates of successful resuscitation (55.8 percent for blacks vs. 67.4 percent for whites) and survival after resuscitation (45.2 percent for blacks vs. 55.5 percent for whites), the researchers noted.</p>
<p>About a third of the difference can be explained by the patients themselves, Chan said, &#8220;Black patients were sicker when they had a cardiac arrest than white patients,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another third of the difference was explained by the hospitals many black patients were in, Chan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, the quality of care after resuscitating a patient was worse in hospitals treating mostly black patients compared with care in hospitals treating white patients, Chan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The remaining difference in survival between blacks and whites could not be explained, Chan said.</p>
<p>There did not seem to be a difference between the treatment blacks and whites received, so racism did not seem to play a role in care between blacks and whites, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot exclude it fully,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s really hard to imagine that a physician would treat a black patient differently than a white patient during a cardiac arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Nah, most likely black area hospitals don&rsquo;t pay as much so they can&rsquo;t get good doctors and the fact the doctors are likely to get robbed, beaten, murdered, shot, kidnapped, ect. surly has nothing to do with it to eh? Plus genetics, and we all know that everyone is the same on the inside so it just CAN&rsquo;T be genetics. But we shall never find out because it racist. Maybe we should point this out to blacks so we could do some real research and maybe help them&hellip;. nah. Too racist.</p>

		<p>Hospitals that cater to mostly blacks are often overrun with people using the hospital for things as minor as colds and many more just trying to get drugs.  A hospital is a place for emergency medical care.  Take your minor stuff to a primary care physician like the rest of us and see how quickly things improve.</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed the last time I was in the hospital(I was getting a bad cut stitched back together) is that a lot of blacks in the emergency room were complaining about tinnitus(ringing in ears) only to be waiting for the doctor playing their IPods so loud I could hear the lyrics clearly across the noisy ER.  Another black was told she had too much wax in her ears and to stop using Qtips.  She kept asking the doctor if she could use QTips to get it out even after the 5th time he said &#8220;no, your not listening to me, I&rsquo;m telling you to use an ear syringe.&#8221;  She then called him racist and stormed out.</p>

		<p>After reading a lot of medical literature I now have the impression that overall blacks are genetically far more prone to degenerative diseases than Whites and East Asians. However the media tends to give an impression that blacks are some superhealthy race unlike the hapless delicate Whites. I know a few White acquaintances who have been brainwashed by the gutters of Hollywood in forming such an impression about black people. A few medical papers forwarded to them was enough to change their views.</p>

		<p>Inner city hospitals probably suffer from the same syndrome as inner city schools.  Nobody competent wants to work there unless they are in training, or are crazy, or are stuck there.  Moreover, inner city hospitals probably have a larger number of blacks on staff.  Same as inner city schools.  If you are treated by a Stanford grad for your heart attack you are more likely to survive it than if you are treated by a graduate of Granada medical college.  Plus, how many times have we seen the I don&rsquo;t care attitude from blacks in various professions.  I would NOT want an inner city black nurse caring for me, being white.  Put succinctly, the inner city hospitals suffer from all the same problems as the inner city High Schools.  And have the same achievement stats.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Black patients were sicker when they had a cardiac arrest than white patients,&rsquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>More diabetes, more smoking, more drugs, more bad diet not commensurate with their physiology, less preventative care and less using preventative care when it is accessed, and an expectation of instantaneous &#8220;CURE&#8221; rather than treatment and resultant bad attitude when it is realized that no &#8220;CURE&#8221; is forthcoming.</p>
<p>NOT because whitey doctors fail to treat them. <br>
