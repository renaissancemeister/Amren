<h1>Wake: Vote Likely Will Reshape Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Goldsmith, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), October 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wake County&rsquo;s public schools could be headed for a historic remake as candidates critical of the current board and its approach to school diversity swept three districts in Tuesday&rsquo;s election, and a fourth candidate led in race that likely will end in a runoff.</p>
<p>If seen as a referendum on the board&rsquo;s policies on diversity, the election showed that the voters who turned out in the four districts at stake decided in large numbers to reject the status quo. The candidates who won outright won by an average of more than 22 percentage points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Candidates backed by the Wake Schools Community Alliance won by convincing margins in Cary, in eastern Wake communities including Knightdale and in North Raleigh-Morrisville. Their victories mean that the board&rsquo;s policies of busing to ensure diversity and mandatory year-round schools will at the very least face opposition from four members on the nine-member panel, a disappointing prospect to those who campaigned for their opponents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Eastern Wake&rsquo;s District 1, former Wake Forest town commissioner Chris Malone won convincingly over former teacher Rita Rakestraw, one of the election&rsquo;s most outspoken champions of diversity.</p>
<p>A runoff appeared likely in District 2, which encompasses parts of Garner, Fuquay Varina and Willow Spring. Candidate John Tedesco, a Big Brothers Big Sisters official who campaigned hard for a change in board policies, took nearly half the vote total in the district, but not enough for a clear victory over consultant and retired educator Cathy Truitt, in second place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Results in today&rsquo;s Wake County School Board election will be closely watched for what they reveal about voters&rsquo; attitudes toward mandated diversity in the schools.</p>
<p>Although the outcome has countywide implications, the results hinge on voters living in four outlying districts that are picking school board members, with an incumbent running in only one of the races. Opponents of current school board policies such as busing for diversity and mandatory year-round schools already have one ally on the board, Ron Margiotta, and could govern school-system policy with victory in all four districts today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The opposition got significant backing from local Republicans, who donated heavily to the principal political action committee that funded their campaigns, the Wake Schools Community Alliance. The group got started early, said member Allison Backhouse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stakes in the election were the highest in years, observers said. The challengers to the status quo bolstered their arguments about the folly of busing not just by reciting tales of long, inconvenient rides for students. They also cited statistics in aid of their position that busing for diversity did not even achieve its goal: a better education for students from low-income families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The race also took on a pronounced partisan flavor, despite the officially nonpartisan nature of the race. Democrats largely supported the current board, while the county Republic Party lined up behind the challengers. Demographics seemed to play in the challengers&rsquo; favor, as the four districts up for grabs were generally more heavily Republican than the &#8220;old Raleigh&#8221; districts whose representatives were not up for reelection.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been noticing - slowly but surely - that as the label &#8220;Rayciss!&#8221; loses some of its power, more white people are feeling freer to speak the obvious&hellip;diversity is a devastating blow to any hopes of success. </p>
<p>I think white parents are feeling a little more confident about moving beyond just rolling their eyes and gritting their teeth when the subject of diversity comes up. </p>
<p>I think that the more outspoken white families are now willing to acknowledge what statistics have been screaming for years&hellip;diversity is the death knell for white communities. </p>

		<p>How&rsquo;s this for a win:  Even in NC&rsquo;s most liberal county, deseg isn&rsquo;t liked.  Now, the only hitch in the ride will be the Federal judiciary.  The good news on that is that they may not collar Wake County&rsquo;s public schools because other deseg consent decrees are gradually winding down.  But after more Obama appointments, this might change.</p>

		<p>I got to vote in this election (my first time voting) and the results really made my day: <br>
1. I got to strike a blow against diversity<br>
2. I found out that the majority of Wake county voters aren&rsquo;t as liberal as i thought they were. and<br>
3. something I took part in got on AR (and it was good news for once!) :)<br>

		<p>This is definitely a step in the right direction. Now, all we need is for schools in urban areas across the nation to embrace a similar ideology. I think many whites, even those who classify themselves as mainly progressive Democrats, are getting fed up with their dispossession. Hopefully, this will foreshadow changes to come.</p>

		<p>If this state itself can vote against diversity, more states may do the same in the nearby future. It&rsquo;s becoming more and more evident that people really don&rsquo;t care for integration. The days of forced diversity and multiculturalism seem to be numbered at this point.</p>

		<p>As I have commented here before, Charlotte is having this same debate. A small town in the Charlotte school district agreed to pay more taxes to build a High School of their own, only to have the school board announce they will be busing students to and from another school. Needless to say, this small town is majority white and the students they want to bus in are from a majority black neighborhood.</p>
<p>Kids who live closest to this school won&rsquo;t be allowed to attend<br>
so they can make this school more &#8220;diversity friendly&#8221; ?</p>
<p>Parents are boiling mad as they should be. This school is scheduled to open in 2010, so this fight is not over yet.<br>
Why can&rsquo;t they just leave them alone? I have a theory about this. They feel they need to force blacks and whites together, so they can continue to cover up the utter failure of blacks without the help of whitey.</p>

		<p>The word is not &#8216;desegragation&rsquo; (or &#8216;deseg&rsquo;), the phrase is &#8216;FORCED integration&rsquo; or &#8216;the end of freedom of association&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Kudos again, to our favorite Atlanta Attorney, the wise and prophetic Sam Dickson!   Sam has said countless times that these social engineering, egalitarianism diseased Marxist leftists   can&rsquo;t seem to know when it&rsquo;s time to back off on their relentless and maniacal inclination to constantly attack and demean and pound whites over the head with their diversity and multiculturalism club.  </p>
<p>This turns out to be a huge advantage for our side in this argument, since most whites are so passive and cowardly on the subject of race that it takes repeated and pronounced whacks along side their empty heads, before that spinal column begins to regenerate itself!</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t matter in the slightest whether those &#8216;white&rsquo; children have classrooms that are filled with blacks, mexicans, and whoever else, or just other &#8216;white people&rsquo;; they will still only receive marginal benefits, given the reality of differential fertility and its hugely detrimental impact on the population. The vast majority of &#8216;white&rsquo; people I see around me who have children are clearly the most undesirable elements, or at the vert best they are average. </p>
<p>In another generation, the white communities will probably be indistinguishable from the mexican communities. It isn&rsquo;t just about &#8216;race&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s about human quality. </p>

		<p>Education is one area which the Constitution left to the states. It is a states&rsquo; rights issue and states, not the feds should determine anything to do with education. No Child Left Behind is a travesty along with Migrant programs, bi-lingual programs, and Title programs. These programs do nothing. In New Mexico, the state constitution states that &#8220;all classes are to be taught in English&#8221;. This phrase had to be included before the US would take New Mexico as a state. Once a program such as Title I is started, the kids never get out of it. If they did, the flow of federal dollars would cease and some teacher would be out of a job doing useless programs with kids who eventually don&rsquo;t care because they never learn anything.</p>

		<p>At least someone is attempting to deconstruct busing. If McCain or any other presidential candidate said he would stop busing he would be president.<br>
Lets&rsquo; be real. Cary and much of North Carolina is full of relocated Yankees. When the yankees have the rules enfrced on them that they pushed on every one else then it becomes a terrible thing.<br>
I do not care as long as the monstrsity is ended. Whites are getting sick of being treated like second class citizens but we still got a long way to go. Go North Carolina.  </p>

		<p>Many are groaning, &#8220;not this guy posting again&#8221;.  Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve been there.  Early 70&rsquo;s bussing gimmick, Nashville, TN.  The establishment commies won, &amp; ghetto blacks were &#8220;bussed&#8221; to our super white almost country suburb, &amp; vice versa: but luckily for us only one hellish year of &#8220;school&#8221; in the &#8216;hood was forced.  Hideous results ensued over time.  Now nearly 40 years later the local schools are awful embarrassments, &#8220;white flight&#8221; to Wilson county etc. is in full force, and blacks &amp; third-worlders are everywhere in this once-proud community.  Somebody won the battle; who was it?</p>

		<p>We have &#8220;schools of choice&#8221; here in Michigan.  This allows students to attend any school within county borders with permission of both school districts.  The predominantly left-wing school boards deem it fit to poison the suburban (mostly white) schools with the &#8220;human garbage&#8221; from the predominantly &#8220;minority&#8221; areas by promoting this misguided program.  The evidence of deterioration is seen in the behavior of the students (&#8220;hip-hop&#8221;, &#8220;wiggers&#8221; and increases in violence.  Greedy left-wing school boards do this for MONEY because, the amount of funds a district receives depends on enrollment.<br>
Parents, make the sacrifice  &mdash;  homeschool or send your children to private (parochial) schools.  You don&rsquo;t need the violence in the so-called &#8220;public&#8221; schools.</p>

		<p>I picked up my kids today at their elementary school in Cary, which I don&rsquo;t do often. I saw a lot of things that I was not happy with in the line of parents, including:</p>
<p>- colored folks<br>
- middle eastern folks<br>
- mexican folks (And I&rsquo;ll bet at least half of them don&rsquo;t have driver&rsquo;s licenses.)</p>
<p>It appeared that their numbers were about even with the white soccer moms from Cary. (We live in the county, but near enough to Cary.)</p>
<p>We need to go back to neighborhood schools, so my kids will not be forced to associate with these refugees from the third world. I pay good money in taxes for schools, and I paid good money not to live near these folks. </p>
