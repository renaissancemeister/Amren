<h1><a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idINTRE58T5A720090930">Girls Warned Not to Hide Boyfriends&rsquo; Guns</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A campaign warning girls not to stash or carry guns for their boyfriends was launched by London police Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hard-hitting adverts, which are aimed at 15 to 19-year-olds of African and African Caribbean heritage, are designed to combat a worrying growth in the number of young women being arrested and convicted of possessing weapons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who store and carry guns for others are partly responsible for the crimes committed with those weapons. The consequences for them, their families and their friends are not worth thinking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said Trident officers had charged 12 women with possessing a gun so far this year of which seven were teenagers. That compares with 13 charged last year and two the year before.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four-week campaign, which has the strap line &#8220;Hide his gun and you help commit the crime,&#8221; will run on radio, in cinemas and on billboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly, young women have always been involved in carrying and storing firearms,&#8221; said Claudia Webbe, chairman of Trident&rsquo;s Independent Advisory Group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Vulnerable young women are sometimes pressurized into storing or transporting the weapons by men they know, or sometimes willingly do so.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I say let them hide the guns.  Then the prosecutors can use the gun thing to make them roll over against the men.  It&rsquo;s not as if evidence otherwise is easy to gather.</p>

		<p>Inevitably some rabble-rouser will complain that the ads were only targeted at blacks and the police will apologize.</p>

		<p>How is this possible ? Guns are illegal in London. <br>
In London burglaries are often carried out when the homeowners are home but in America it is when they are gone (most of the time). This is because of guns. In America a burgular who breaks in often on homeowners has a very short career expectation. <br>
In England there is little be afraid of. <br>
What happens when one of htese armed African thugs breaks into a house with a white woman home&hellip;..<br>
I think the English goverment takes the lead in the destruction of the west.Surely the worst monarchy.</p>

		<p>Typical of a lot of African and African Caribbean men. They don&rsquo;t want to take responsibility for their actions and want someone else to get in trouble instead of them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these silly girls realize that while they are in jail, their man is shacking up with their sister or best friend?</p>

		<p>Everything is always about &#8216;racism&rsquo; yet here we have black girls carrying guns. What&rsquo;s the punishment for carrying a gun in a nation where gun ownership is completely banned? I bet it&rsquo;s advertised as a stiff punishment, for some reason. Let&rsquo;s follow these cases and see how much time these Black girls actually serve in jail. </p>

		<p>The fact that Operation Trident even exists shows that in some ways the UK is less PC than the USA is.  Major newspapers in the UK have recently had front page articles about the racial disparity in crime, something that has not happened in the US since probably before WWII.  American readers should keep these facts in mind before making sweeping condemnations of Britain.  They should also keep in mind that there is tendency in the British press to exaggerate their problems and complain about things that people in most countries just take for granted.  </p>
