<h1>NAACP Claims Former Director Stole More Than a Quarter Million Dollars</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ernie Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Atlanta branch of the NAACP has accused its former executive director and her assistant of stealing more than a quarter-million dollars to pay for medical services, furniture and college tuition.</p>
<p>In a police report filed Oct. 10, chapter leaders say that over a six-year period, Judith Withers-Hanson and Saundra Douglass, her administrative assistant, stole $275,000 from an organization that operates annually on a $400,000 budget.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the report, filed by former chapter president Lonnie King and board member Louise Hornsby, the two women fraudulently applied for American Express cards and wrote checks to pay for personal items.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the period of six years, Withers-Hanson and Douglass used the cards for personal expenses, paid the bills using checks belonging to the association, and covered the usage by making false entries into the association&rsquo;s accounting records,&#8221; the incident report read. &#8220;Some of the expenses paid involved personal dental work for associates, college tuition, expensive meals, and furniture purchases not for use by the association.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. R.L. White, the president of the Atlanta chapter, said everyone in the organization was shocked when the fraud was discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. Judy is a fine lady,&#8221; said White, who said he has been chapter president for about 10 years. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t interact with someone that long without caring about them. But I don&rsquo;t know how all this came to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2002, after someone broke into the NAACP&rsquo;s offices and stole toys that the organization had collected to give to children, Withers-Hanson soberly summed up the pain of the branch losing anything it had worked hard to get.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are an organization that has been in business for 93 years to help people,&#8221; Withers-Hanson said at the time. &#8220;For someone to break in and take what little resources we had is disheartening.&#8221;</p>
<p>White said in January, when a new board was elected, the new treasurer, Richard Rose, conducted a routine audit of the branch&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was going over the books, he found the discrepancies,&#8221; said White, adding that auditors are still sifting through records and trying to find things because of a &#8220;lack of record.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daryl Graham, a spokesman for the state branch of the NAACP confirmed that national is investigating the charges. But the revelation that someone might have stolen $275,000 from the organization could not have come at a worse time.</p>
<p>Under the national direction of Jealous, who at 35 was elected the organization&rsquo;s youngest president in late 2008, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is celebrating its centennial anniversary this year.</p>
<p>One of the centerpieces of the celebration was obviously fund-raising.</p>

		<p>The only surprise here is that the article -for once- did not claim the NAACP is the oldest civil rights organization (it&rsquo;s not - the NRA was founded on 11-17-1871).</p>
<p>Many here on Amren have said &#8220;blacks are their own worst enemies&#8221;&hellip; Here again is 24k proof.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t blame whitey for this one!</p>

<p>I really laughed over that statement.  How can any organization be so incompetent as to not perform proper MONTHLY accounting with periodic independent checks?  This is what happens when you have low-IQ, incompetent people running an organization   &mdash;   they simply don&rsquo;t know how to do it. We see exactly the same thing in the majority of Sub-Saharan nations and in many Black-run American cities.</p>
<p>By the way, congratulations to all the European-Americans who donated money to NAACP.  </p>

<p>And they&rsquo;ll wonder what is wrong with that, because it was his &#8220;turn&#8221; to steal.</p>
<p>They truly believe that&rsquo;s how whitey acquires any wealth. Except when he&rsquo;s unscrupulously using the brothers&rsquo; hard labor to accumulate his vast fortune.</p>

		<p>While it is common knowledge that blacks are petty criminals par excellence, I have to admit, I am still sometimes(though rarely) surprised at how virtually nothing changes when they move up the proverbial ladder of success! It certainly seems to prove that black behavior runs a WHOLE LOT deeper than what is commonly(and wrongly)attributed to &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;under priviledged&#8221; status, etc.  </p>

		<p>Having lived just outside the Atlanta metro area for over 30 years, I just started rolling when I heard this on the local news. As Atlanta is considered the &#8216;cradle of the civil rights movement&rsquo; (which means there is a large population of &#8216;high level&rsquo; blacks and black organizations, along with the common rabble, these kinds of stories appear regularly in this area. But for it to happen in the NAACP, the bulwark of black organizations, clearly BY blacks, is hysterical.</p>

<p>Oh ye of little faith!</p>
<p>BTW I like how in the story the Rev claims to be &#8220;shocked&#8221; by NAACP members stealing. That was about as shocking as this morning&rsquo;s sunrise.</p>

		<p>  Before fall of 1970 (total integration) schools in the black belt never had missing funds . Even the black schools usually had white administrators . Now it seems every few years a nearby school goes missing a million dollars . I am dead serious . ` </p>

		<p>This article is truly an AmRen gem, blacks stealing? who woulda thunk it? I think closer examination would reveal that blue-eyed white devils were reponsible for this larncenous behaviour, and that these poor ladies were framed, put Al Sharpton on the case, he&rsquo;ll find the culprits, probably the same evil bastards who raped Tawana Brawley. And even if these women are guilty, 250,000+ dollars over 6 yrs shows a dedication to a superior work ethic, and ya&rsquo;ll say blacks are lazy! Pshaw!</p>

		<p>Black elected officials are notorious for corruption. Now the prestigious(irony) NAACP. I believe there has been official theft at the top off this irrelevant organization before. But what do you expect? Blacks still think the corrupt promiscous Communist traitor King was their saviour!</p>

		<p>Six years of improper card usage?  A mind is a terrible thing to waste&hellip;especially on checks and balances and proper accouting principles. Some more lowered standards for the undeserving.</p>
<p>It never ends when it&rsquo;s their turn to steal.  By the way, &#8220;don&rsquo;t worry these wonderful people will look out for whitey when we are in need.&#8221;  Right?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s more &#8220;typical&#8221; Black concern for other Blacks&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/20091016_Pa___6_stole_375G_from_food_program_for_low-income_moms__kids.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/20091016_Pa___6_stole_375G_from_food_program_for_low-income_moms__kids.html</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right&hellip; six Black perps literally stole food out of the mouths of other Blacks. The burning question: How do you explain the sociopathic mentality displayed by so many, many Blacks&hellip; not just in America, but literally, by Blacks all over the world? If not genetic, what in hell is the cause?</p>

		<p>File this one under the heading &#8220;poetic justice.&#8221; The looters get looted   &mdash;   gotta love it! Reminds me of the black tax preparers who take money from black simpletons to claim &#8220;slavery reparation tax credits&#8221; for them on their 1040s. The result: back taxes, interest and penalties, <i>plus</i> the cash given to the crooked preparer!</p>

		<p>Thanks to Fed Up for post #14. </p>
<p>That post&rsquo;s link, and this article, just show that blacks tend to be exactly like children - impulsive, immature, and completely self-centered. </p>
<p>They have no sense of the future, i.e. at some point even the most basic level of scrutiny will uncover their deeds.</p>
<p>Immature, impulsive, and short-sighted. No wonder every venture they control ends in disaster.</p>
