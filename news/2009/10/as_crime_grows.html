<h1>As Crime Grows in Mexico, More People Flee to Texas</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alfredo Corchado, Dallas Morning News, October 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If anyplace should be safe from the extortions, kidnappings and killings that have gripped this troubled nation, it is the state of Aguascalientes, population of less than 1 million, and its once-quiet communities such as Pabellon de Arteaga.</p>
<p>But now the state is being afflicted with the same kind of crime and insecurity that other parts of Mexico  &mdash;  such as the border with Texas  &mdash;  have lived with for years, a result of the growing reach of drug cartels and the success of anti-drug efforts elsewhere, authorities say. The instability has led to an increase in out-migration, and North Texas is a favored destination.</p>
<p>Over the years, the central state of Aguascalientes, known as Mexico&rsquo;s Rhode Island because of its small size, has gained a reputation for having the best quality of life and safest neighborhoods  &mdash;  &#8220;rich in culture and rich in boredom, the good kind,&#8221; quipped Irma Carrillo, an education professor at the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes.</p>
<p>But in the last couple of years, residents say, a steady stream of people from Pabellon and nearby communities, including the city of Aguascalientes, have fled for other parts of Mexico or the United States, particularly Texas.</p>
<p>About 200 residents of Aguascalientes, which means Hot Springs, now call the North Texas area home, and about half have arrived in the past two years, according to Miriam Carrillo, sister of Irma and president of Club de Migrantes Juntos Por Pabellon, an immigrant hometown association.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a poignant difference between the new arrivals and those who came years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are people who feel obligated to leave Mexico&#8221; because of the crime, said Miriam Carrillo. &#8220;These are the people who used to create jobs back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the United States putting more pressure on smuggling routes along the Gulf Coast in recent years, drug smugglers have rerouted cocaine and marijuana shipments to the Pacific Coast, particularly through the southern state of Guerrero and the northwestern states of Michoac√°n and Jalisco, said Arturo Islas, an expert on national security issues.</p>
<p>That shift has led to a sharp increase in violence in those areas, and has put Aguascalientes  &mdash;  with easy access to Texas by way of El Paso and Laredo  &mdash;  squarely in the path of the rerouted contraband.</p>
<p>To finance their operations, drug traffickers have turned this once-tranquil industrious region into a haven of kidnappings, extortions and killings. Drug trafficking crimes rose from 157 in 2005 to 602 in 2007, a 127 percent increase, according to a study by Islas.</p>

		<p>The reason the drug gang violence has gotten bad to the level of a pandemic in Mexico is because American immigration authorities won&rsquo;t stop the flow of people, mostly, but they seem to want to do something about the drugs and those who bring them in.  This keeps the drug gangs trapped in Mexico, and therefore fighting among each other and fighting the &#8220;legitimate authorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How can they just &#8220;flee to Texas&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the strangest thing in the world to witness how Mexican illegal immigration is taken to be a fait accompli by Texans and Americans in general. </p>

		<p>Ironically, our lack of enforcement-for our immigration laws-is making the Mexican Drug Cartels more dangerous, here in America/Canada and Mexico.</p>

And as they &#8220;flee&#8221;, they bring the crime problem along with them!</p>
<p>This is remarkably similar to people fleeing the Black Plague in the Middle Ages.  They fled the cities to get away from the Plague, but they only took it with them and spread it wherever they went.</p>
<p>The only answer is that you have to fix the problem at home, and correct the conditions that cause it.  Dumping your problems over the fence on your neighbor is no solution.</p>

With all the claims of racism, it&rsquo;s telling that these people always turn to whitey for safety and security.</p>
<p>Then they turn around and blame us for the problems they create and demand we provide the solutions.</p>
<p>Lose-lose for us. Win-win for them.</p>

		<p>There is a Texas school district that recently has banned Mexican kids who commute over the border to school each day from attending school. Of course, this was presented on AOL&rsquo;s website with the usual hysterics and bleeding heart tone. Interestingly, after the one-sided article, there was a place for readers to vote, and something like three quarters of them agreed with the district&rsquo;s policy.</p>

		<p>More Mexicans are fleeing to Texas?  WHOPPEE! Aren&rsquo;t us Texans the &#8220;lucky&#8221; ones. We get to support these freeloading parasites. Their crimes&hellip; the social problems they cause simply by acting like Mexicans.</p>

		<p>El Paso is so dangerous. Cartels operate there with impunity, gangs like Barrio Azteca do whatever they want without regard for the law, drugs flow through their just like liquor did during prohibition, etc&hellip; It&rsquo;s American in name only anymore&hellip; an extension of Juarez.  </p>

It&rsquo;s not just Texas!   It&rsquo;s the same thing in California. Crime has gotten so bad in Tijuana that business owners and well to do people who can afford it maintain homes across the border in San Diego, where they keep their families.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what IS happening and has been occurring for years now.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long before we see headlines like this:<br>
      Drug Crime in Texas Pushes Citizens further North</p>
<p>Or how about a coming headline for California? <br>
  Mass Evacuation from California as Infrastructure Collapses<br>
    Scarcity of clean water, little food, exorbitant taxes<br>
              Experts say blue states are next</p>
<p>And the degeneration continues as expected.  The commercial real estate market is just beginning to fold; prime, or &#8220;good&#8221; mortgages are adjusting on schedule which means, from now until 2011, 48% of prime home loans with ARMs will have mortgage balances that are higher than the value of the property.  70% of these are estimated to go into foreclosure and will total about 8 million. </p>
<p>Commercial real estate defaults will be enough to wreck the system on their own.  Throw in the residential real estate foreclosures and both together make the sub-prime debacle appear to be no more than a blip on the screen on Wall Street.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syyGqmvCo7Y" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syyGqmvCo7Y</a></p>
<p>Imagine these possible headlines shortly about the drug gang problem:</p>
<p>      FBI Says Drug Money Behind Most Corporations<br>
       Economy Decline Greater Than 1930&rsquo;s </p>
<p>      Drug Kingpins Now in Control of US Southwest<br>
       No one gets elected without their approval</p>
<p>These are in line with the way we are going and none of them are far fetched.  The only thing needed to complete a reflection of our downward spiral would be another headline, after the ones above, that might say:</p>
<p>         Southwest Declares Sovereignty; Secession Expected<br>
             President to Declare Martial Law<br>
            Cartel-backed Militias Vow to Fight<br>
                 Mexico Threatens Action</p>

		<p>And as more of the Mexicans move to Texas, more Texans (and much of the Southwest) will get tired of the spanish-speaking and third world culture taking over that they will move further north.  Of course, this will be labelled as &#8220;white plight&#8221; from the anti-white degenerates in power.</p>
