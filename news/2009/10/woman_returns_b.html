<h1>Woman Returns Black Baby</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>HBD Books, October 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the Today Show there was a white woman who adopted a black baby and then decided to give it back. Women are frivolous indeed.</p>
<p>Notice that they don&rsquo;t mention race once. Surely that had nothing to do with it!</p>
<p>The baby was lying by the side of the road, not where children of good genetic stock are usually found. In addition, the child was probably deprived before finding his white family. He likely wasn&rsquo;t up for much socializing. We know that infants are more comfortable looking at people of their own race, so this new &#8220;mother&#8221; of his might as well have been an alien. </p>
<p>Thankfully this foolish woman is going back to devoting herself to raising her real children.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Brett Singer, ParentDish, October 1, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The &#8220;Today&#8221; show on NBC did a shocking segment on Anita Tedaldi, &#8220;a woman who adopted a child and then gave him up 18 months later.&#8221; Tedaldi is a writer who originally told this story on The New York Times&rsquo; Motherlode blog.</p>
<p>She and her husband have five biological children and decided that they wanted more. After going through the approval process, she was able to adopt a baby who was found by the side of a road. Despite her pre-adoption belief that she would &#8220;be able to parent this little boy the same way I had done with my biological daughters,&#8221; she terminated the adoption after 18 months.</p>
<p>Because she couldn&rsquo;t bond with him, she said.</p>
<p>Asked by Matt Lauer what this means, Tedaldi was somewhat vague and did manage to blame the baby. &#8220;It went both ways,&#8221; she said in the interview. &#8220;The child, D., wasn&rsquo;t connecting with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only did Tedaldi give back a baby she had decided to adopt, she actually says that the baby shares some of the responsibility for this lack of bonding. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the original Times blog, Tedaldi wrote that she &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t connecting with [the baby] on the visceral level I experienced with my biological daughters.&#8221;</p>

		<p> I have two friends (couples) and a relative who have adopted non-White children. Two of the adoptions have worked out well   &mdash;   so far. In the other, the child suffered severe injuries at birth that have left him unable to walk, talk, or do much of anything for himself. But in all three cases, the non-White adoptees were East Asian.</p>
<p> In Tedaldi&rsquo;s case, she not only adopted a baby that had been discarded like trash, but it was a black baby. If you believe in genes having a major influence on our development, behavior, etc., as I do, then you know she made a mistake. She cut her losses by taking the toddler back so someone of his own heritage can adopt him. This is a lesson to White couples who want to adopt: Get a White child if at all possible; DO NOT adopt a black one, unless you look forward to having major problems in the years to come.</p>

		<p>Well, this baby may be in for some rough times, having been rejected not once but twice. This in addition to all the psychological ills blacks are already prone to. The white mother should not have attempted to adopt this black child. However, more than blaming her, I blame the PC brainwashing campaign that tells us all races are exactly the same in all ways, that race is just  skin color, and so on. Obviously, this adoptive mother fell for it. Add a couple more lives to the millions wrecked by political correctness down through the years.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t agree with white families adopting black children, once an adoptive parent makes the commitment of adoption they should follow through with their decision. Adopting a human child is not like adopting a pet, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to take them back if &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t work out&#8221;. In any case, a family with 5 natural children shouldn&rsquo;t be adopting children. There are plenty of wonderful, loving people who have no children but who would just love to be parents to an adopted child.</p>

		<p>I generally watch the Today Show (with a healthy dose of MSM awareness), and never once was the race of the child mentioned.</p>
<p>Stick with your own race when adopting. It&rsquo;s a &#8216;duh&rsquo; moment.</p>

		<p>Although I&rsquo;m an amateur at it I like biological explanations of human behaviour. We have children because our genes want to reproduce themselves. We have evolved numerous adaptations which lead us into sex, pair bonding, wanting children, and being protective of them. We could also reproduce our genes by supporting our racial group but evolution has not left us with adaptations for this because in the past we could take for granted our bonds with our racial group. In the modern world where there is so much mixing of racial groups we do not naturally have adaptations which lead us to support our racial group. So we have to do it on purpose as a way of reproducing our genes. People who feel drawn to having more children by adoption outside of their race should consider finding ways to help out their racial group instead. Hundreds of years from now it won&rsquo;t make a difference whether you made a gene copy of yourself or helped extend your genes by helping your racial group. </p>

		<p>I can relate to her plight. A few years ago, I picked up the most pitiful kitten you ever saw off the side of the road. It had black fur, with a big white stripe along it&rsquo;s back going all the way back to it&rsquo;s huge fluffy tail. I gave it everything a kitten could ever want  &mdash;  a scratching post, a ball of string, toy mice  &mdash;  but the funny thing is, it never let out a meow, never chased a string, never scratched it&rsquo;s post. All it did was hiss at me and raise it&rsquo;s hindquarters and create the most foul odor you ever smelled.</p>
<p>Clearly, the problem must have been subconscious bigotry against black-with-white-stripes kittens on my part. It&rsquo;s all about upbringing, as we all know.<br>

		<p>Just one of the myriad forms that western society&rsquo;s racial insanity assumes.  How weird and creepy is it that white people are so racially insane they can&rsquo;t communicate with one another the idea that no, they probably can&rsquo;t love racially alien children they adopt the way they would their own biological children.  This should be common sense, not taboo.</p>

		<p>This woman should have known this was a bad idea from the get go. To bring a black child into an all white family..surely HE would feel out of place..IMO, she is one of those liberals who do this sort of thing thinking she is doing something wonderful, so she can feel all warm and fuzzy inside only to learn the hard way, just maybe race DOES matter.</p>

		<p>Race and race alone is the reason this woman could not &#8220;bond&#8221; with this baby.  She, like many deluded and easily influenced by the media White women probably thought that she had a moral imperative to adopt a non-White baby.  She probably didn&rsquo;t think this explicitly but rather implicitly or subconsciously.  Here in NYC we see this type of White woman all the time; a politically correct White woman who wants to contribute desperately to multiculturalism and diversity, so much so that she will attempt to adopt - actually go out of her way to adopt - a non-White baby.  Most of these women will keep the baby even if there is no &#8220;bonding&#8221;.  At least this woman had some sort of conception of reality.</p>
<p>Everywhere we look White people are conditioned into believing that they have some sort of moral obligation to assist non-Whites.  This is contributing to the destruction of White people - this misplaced altruism that is hurting Whites and Whites alone.</p>

		<p>I know of a White family that adopted two koreans and a Guatamalen, who turned out well, largely. But there really is something cold, in that family. How hard is it to adopt a White children? Shame on the White race for abandoning its own like no other race would. Its women, its children, its men, all forsaken for blacks and Asians by race traitors and liberals. Sigh&hellip;</p>

<p>We considered fleetingly adopting. Both Catholic church agencies and other adoption sources had only mixed breed or otherwise unadoptable kids to offer. Our answer: &#8220;Thanks but no thanks.&#8221; Not racism, just that we prefer children that look and are like us.</p>

		<p>Not only do I feel sorry for the baby, but her biological children as well. What happens when her daughters becomes teens and they no longer bond with her the way she thinks they should? Will she toss them out as well?</p>
<p>What I think is really sick, this women goes on national TV to exploit this baby one last time and the news media went along with it. Maybe some good will come from this, maybe some loving family watching this circus will take the baby and give it a good home that every child deserves.</p>

		<p>General George Patton grew up in a home where skunks were allowed free access, and guests were advised not to trouble the inoffensive creatures.  I agree with the General&rsquo;s father: skunks are much less trouble than Blacks.  They&rsquo;ll leave you alone if you leave them alone.  </p>

		<p>Why are people saying &#8220;she&rsquo;s a White woman?&#8221;  She looks hispanic and has an accent.  :/  What she&rsquo;s not flat-out stating is her children rejected the baby.  I come from a larger family, if Mom brought in a baby other than our race it would seem strange.  Our innate instinct for survival as a nucleus would kick in and we&rsquo;d probably want the adoption removed.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous, many Hispanics are white. Hispanic is a linguistic/cultural group not a racial one. She doesn&rsquo;t look like a mestiza or mulatta to me and her last name (Tedaldi) is Italian. However, if she is Hispanic, that&rsquo;s probably how she was able to get away with this. Imagine the outcry if an Anglo had done this!</p>

		<p>About fifteen years ago, I was at a historical enactment day at a former early 19th century Russian trading post in Northern California.  There was a little group of white teenage females apparently babysitting a black male child that appeared to be about three years old.  The child kept lashing out at them physically, whenever they tried to touch him, let alone pick him up.  But the pathetic white girls went on and on, trying to mother him when it was embarassingly clear that even at three, he hated them through and through.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white and grew up in a white suburb. A family nearby us had adopted a black girl. She grew up with us. The girl was ok, she was outgoing and quite beautiful. Unfortunately, she never felt as though she fit in with her family, nor with us. The girl was never criminal oriented, but when she grew up, she became a single mother, sought out and moved in with her biological black mother. We all thought that was sad, but perhaps inevitable. Compared to the other horror stories, her adoption was as successful as it could possibly be. At least she didn&rsquo;t lash out against her family or us.</p>

		<p>One of the most ridiculous things I&rsquo;ve come across in the Christian church I attend, not to knock this religion, is having to see the head pastor encourage people of his congregation to adopt black children from Ethiopia. He at least had the sense to admit that these children were better off staying in their own country, but this still didn&rsquo;t stop my church from trying to adopt 9 children from this 3rd world country. I even saw a white couple in my brother&rsquo;s church in S. Cal once proudly stand up and display their new adopted black baby, and the entire congregation clapped! I was wondering when whites are going to wake up to the fact that blacks are, have been, and always will be the most different race there is in comparison to whites that there ever be on Earth. And that when the two races come into contact with each other, and live amongst each other, there is going to be injury to both sides, but mostly more injury to whites. I&rsquo;m glad the lady came to here senses and realized that this black kid wasn&rsquo;t for her, and won&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice. </p>

		<p>Whites adopting black children are akin to liberals buying baby alligators as house pets; they may be cute when they are young but when they grow older their true predator nature emerges&hellip;     </p>
