<h1><a href="https://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/10/larry_langford_found_guilty.html">Larry Langford Found Guilty on All 60 Counts</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Birmingham News (Alabama), October 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Larry Langford, Birmingham&rsquo;s mayor and a former Jefferson County commissioner, has been found guilty in his federal bribery trial.</p>
<p>Langford, who is 61 or 63, was found guilty of taking about $236,000 in cash and gifts from Montgomery investment banker Bill Blount and lobbyist Al LaPierre.</p>
<p>Both pleaded guilty in the case and testified they made cash payments to Langford while he was the president of the Jefferson County Commission to ensure business for Blount&rsquo;s investment bank, Blount Parrish &amp; Co.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All this trial did was interrupt my Bible study classes for two weeks,&#8221; he [Langford] said, adding he faces a potential sentence of 805 years. He said if he lived to be 80, he would have to die and &#8220;come back 10 more times&#8221; to serve such a sentence.</p>
<p>Judge Scott Coogler decided Langford would forfeit $241,843. The lawyers agreed.</p>
<p>Coogler ordered a sentencing report within 90 to 120 days and said Langford would remain free until then on the existing $50,000 unsecured bond.</p>
<p>Birmingham City Council President Carole Smitherman is now mayor of Alabama&rsquo;s largest city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  State Sen. Linda Coleman, D-Birmingham, disagreed, saying she was shocked by the verdict and feared it would hurt Birmingham, Jefferson County and the state of Alabama.</p>
<p>  &#8220;It is a very sad day for Birmingham. This is going to set us back, I think. I look at all the progress that&rsquo;s been made. I look at all the projects on the books,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;I saw a new hope for Birmingham. I&rsquo;m just really saddened. I don&rsquo;t see how anybody how anybody could find any joy in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>State Rep. Oliver Robinson, D-Birmingham, said he&rsquo;s known Langford for many years and that he&rsquo;s a good-hearted person.</p>

61 or 63?  Does this guy not know his own age?  If anyone knows the story behind this ambiguity of Langford&rsquo;s age, that would be interesting to know.<br>

		<p>This story came in under the radar. Could it be that no one wanted to bring attention to the fact that Birmingham, the cradle of the American civil rights movement, now controlled by the people who wanted it, have destroyed it from within?<br>

		<p>Black people lose credability when they rally around their own which they do frequently. And, blacks behave this way much too frequently in proportion to their numbers. Stereotyping; a repetitive behavior. Go figure.</p>

<p>I know that many Southern states didn&rsquo;t issue birth certificates for newborns until relatively recently.  2009 minus 61 or 63 equals 1948 or 1946, which just might predate BCs wherever he was born, assuming Alabama.</p>

<p>The Bible study obviously hasn&rsquo;t helped a great deal. At least he can do math, though.<br>

		<p>I just love the excuses for this guy, e.g. &#8220;He&rsquo;s a good man. He&rsquo;s got flaws. We&rsquo;ve all got flaws&hellip;They (the jury) must have had their mind already made up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder what these excusers are trying to say. Does supposed good character invalidate the charges against him?</p>
<p>These (probably black) excuse makers typically are ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to condemn a white person for some alleged &#8220;racist&#8221; remark or some such thing, without the facts, while at the same time, they think black people ought to get away with real crime.  Sad.</p>

		<p>Anyone notice the total absence of remorse and shame in this man?  </p>
<p>Me, too. </p>
<p>This is the mind of a very corrupt individual, a true criminal, and that, in both character and soul.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s worth pulling up the full story just to read the list of individual counts. Most of the bribery counts aren&rsquo;t for accepting cash, but for taking free designer clothing, watches and the like. He sold his soul for THAT?</p>

		<p>&#8220;This story came in under the radar&#8221;. </p>
<p>Here in North Carolina all this year an elder state senator, R.C. Soles has been in the news. 3 or 4 young men claim the senator has been trading favors to them in exchange for sex. Records show he bought them all cars, even houses. One of them got &#8216;jealous&rsquo; and went to the media &#8216;exposing&rsquo; it all. Later he shot one of the very same men during a dispute calling it self defense. There hasn&rsquo;t been a single word about it the national news. Mr Soles is a Democrat.</p>

		<p>TechnoDan brings up an interesting point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just love the excuses for this guy, e.g. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good man. He&rsquo;s got flaws. We&rsquo;ve all got flaws&hellip;They (the jury) must have had their mind already made up.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a tactic that has long been employed.  I&rsquo;m almost exactly certain that &#8220;we all have problems, and some of us like sushi whereas some do not&#8221; would not have been an acceptable defense for Jeffery Dahmer.</p>
<p>This is seasoned lightly with the &#8220;white people do it too&#8221; defense, which is as ridiculous as claiming that Kodiak bears are harmless because, hey, bovines are occasionally known to maul humans.</p>
