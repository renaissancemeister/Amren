			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Moore, London Telegraph, October 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the modern Anglican Baptism service, the congregation is warned to avoid &#8220;the glamour of evil&#8221;. No danger of that with Nick Griffin, is there? On Question Time on Thursday night, he resembled a disgruntled commuter on a late-night train from Liverpool Street  &mdash;  the sort who engages you in conversation with superficial, beery geniality and then inflicts his unpleasant opinions without a break until debouching at Romford. Not a bat-squeak of Nuremburg Rally glamour  &mdash;  only the drone of banality.</p>
<p>Yet the appearance of Mr Griffin on the programme produced the greatest coalition of the British establishment since the Yes campaign in the European referendum of 1975. The sledgehammer portentously cracked the nut.</p>
<p>Three state-funded politicians of the three main parties denounced the dismal Griffin. The state-funded millionaire, David Dimbleby, forsaking all chairmanly impartiality, even told the wretched man not to smile. The audience, much younger and more &#8220;ethnic&#8221; than the actual composition of the population, cheered each sally against him. Bonnie Greer, an American, spoke of the &#8220;good sense of the British people&#8221; in rejecting the BNP. But if Mr Griffin had not been so charmless, I think I would have felt another traditional British quality  &mdash;  sympathy for the underdog.</p>
<p>The message coming out of the programme, reinforced by the BBC&rsquo;s self-congratulatory coverage, was: &#8220;Free speech triumphed. Vile Griffin was allowed his say, but we saw him off. Aren&rsquo;t we all marvellous?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, we aren&rsquo;t marvellous. We are smug. We are missing two important points.</p>
<p>The first is that we are slipshod in our definition of extremism. The BNP certainly is extreme, because hate is intrinsic to its message. But our Government has active links with people who are more extreme. There are Islamist groups which support Hamas suicide bombings, the killing of homosexuals (Mr Griffin merely finds it &#8220;creepy&#8221; when they kiss in public) and the killing of British troops in Afghanistan. These groups engage with the state, and even get taxpayers&rsquo; money. The Government justifies this with the weird theory that it is only the hard men who can hold back the even harder men from violence. So the hard men get the leverage.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, Labour has set up a system which permits and pays Martin McGuinness to be Deputy First Minister. Mr McGuinness was for many years Chief of Staff of the IRA, planning its terrorist operations. He has dropped this occupation, but never renounced it. He has proved the favourite terrorist argument  &mdash;  well-calculated murder wins you power. When Martin goes on Question Time these days, there is no Griffin-style bashing, just the solemn nodding of panel heads when he explains how to bring peace to our troubled world.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Jack Straw fiercely engaged Nick Griffin on the subject of Holocaust denial. But when he was Foreign Secretary, Mr Straw led the attempt to appease President Ahmadinejad of Iran, who denies the Holocaust on the global stage and is trying to build a nuclear bomb to wipe out Israel.</p>
<p>When establishment figures say that the attitudes of the BNP help prepare the ground for violence, they are right. But they do not apply this logic to their engagement with Islamism  &mdash;  the only form of extremism which nowadays kills large numbers of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>As for the BBC, it devotes hours of broadcasting to straining after links with racists among the Tories&rsquo; eurosceptic allies at the European Parliament. Yet it approvingly (I heard it on Today yesterday) reports Hamas without ever mentioning the anti-semitic libels which are in that organisation&rsquo;s founding Charter.</p>
<p>The second error shown by the Question Time panellists  &mdash;  and by virtually all political leaders in this country  &mdash;  is to ignore the problems that are winning the BNP votes. Exposing Holocaust denial is worth doing, but easy. The hard bit is the real resentment on which the BNP can capitalise.</p>
<p>This week, a campaign called Nothing British (full title: &#8220;There&rsquo;s Nothing British about the BNP&#8221;) launched. It draws attention to how the BNP steals British military symbols and tries to recruit among service families. I wrote the foreword to the manifesto. Focus-group research done by colleagues involved in the campaign finds certain common features among BNP voters. They are not all racists. Many have black friends or have intermarried with non-whites. But they all raise immigration straightaway as their biggest concern. They feel it diminishes their chances in life.</p>
<p>It threatens their jobs, they believe. Ten years ago, a self-employed painter and decorator in, say, Barking might have earned £120 a day, enough to get a reasonable mortgage and sustain a modestly secure family life. Today, after the Government underestimated the number of Eastern Europeans likely to come here by almost 20 times, he would get £70 or £80. If his ailing father pays regular visits to hospital, he may be denied a bed because so many foreign women are giving birth. If his child has special needs, he may find the local school neglects them because it is desperately trying to teach English to children who do not speak it at home. If his brother is a soldier, he may return from risking his life to be insulted on the streets of his country by people who hate it.</p>
<p>The strongest common characteristic of such BNP supporters is pessimism. They feel they are sinking to the bottom of the pile, and that people from other countries are being privileged over them by the public services. If they complain, they are told they are racist. It is not surprising that they say things like &#8220;My country is being taken away from me&#8221;. They are not completely mistaken.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin made one good point on Thursday night. After he had been mocked for speaking about the &#8220;indigenous&#8221; people of Britain, he countered that Jack Straw et al would not dare mock Maoris or American Indians for insisting on their indigenous status. Why shouldn&rsquo;t British whites, he asked, do the same?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, should not lie in giving group rights to any race or tribe, but in offering a reasonable degree of hope to all citizens of our country. It shows how much that hope has been extinguished among poorer whites that twerps like Mr Griffin are now in with a chance.</p>
<p>There was only one good thing about Thursday night&rsquo;s programme. Somewhere in among the baiting of Mr Griffin and his own confused and unattractive theories, a few people seemed to be searching for something unifying out of the history of Britain. They could see Mr Griffin&rsquo;s version was all wrong, but they lacked their own. To use the current buzzword, they seek a &#8220;narrative&#8221;. To use an unfashionable phrase, they want to hear our island story. Until our leaders can give us one, it is broken Britain indeed.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people like Robert Spencer over at Jihad Watch make the same kinds of arguments.  He&rsquo;s anti-Islam to the hilt, like any sane person should be, but then turns around and hates on the only political parties in Europe that actually want to do something about it, like the BNP, the Front National in France, and others in Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Hungary.  Spencer et al. claim that the lamestream conservative parties in those countries are &#8220;failing&#8221; to push the Islam issue, and therefore leaving the field open for the &#8220;far right&#8221; parties.</p>
<p>That analysis is a red herring, because those lamestream conservative parties that Spencer loves so much can&rsquo;t possibly &#8220;succeed&#8221; in the Islam issue.  The reason they can&rsquo;t &#8220;succeed&#8221; is because they believe in racial equality just as much as the lamestream leftist parties do, and therefore are infected with a retrovirus, so to speak.  The only way they could grok the Islam issue is to lose the racial equality, but then Robert Spencer would start calling them &#8220;far right.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>This editorial or article highlights to me why the mass media is going down like a cow to the slaughterhouse floor. The first paragraph alone has too many examples to bother spotlighting so close to dinner being ready. But the prime example is &#8220;twerps like Mr. Griffin&#8221;.  Does the author expect us to follow his line of reasoning when he uses junior High invective? I for one won`t be&hellip; </p>

		<p>Britain&rsquo;s leaders are ignoring the problems that are winning the BNP votes&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a bit of a catch-22, and it makes me wonder if they are wringing their hands and making these pronouncements while in private, in truth, they don&rsquo;t take a word of it seriously. As long as anyone raising these issues is being labeled a Nazi, knuckle dragger, hateful, etc, no one is going to be discussing them. </p>

		<p>This guy is a journalist? If he wants to be known as a thinker and not just an opinion monger he might reflect on the fact that Britain has not had freedom of speech on this topic. He has not been exposed to a full range of discussion. Worthy minds have not felt free to add to the national debate. I recommend that he visit web sites in the USA where ideas have been developed to a much further extent than he has been exposed to in Britain. Sites like amren.com, vdare.com, and the Occidental Quarterly would be good places. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The answer, of course, should not lie in giving group rights to any race or tribe&hellip;&#8221;.  This is like saying that White People, who created Britain and are still the majority, are no more significant than recently arrived Pakistanis or Chinese.  Should speaking the English language  be considered a &#8220;group right&#8221; and banned?  </p>
<p>By Implying that the White majority has no more significance than the tiniest non-white minority group, the government has become the enemy of its White citizens.       </p>

		<p>I attended the Trafalgar Club annual dinner on Saturday 24th. The club is a fund raising body for the BNP and many of its members are people who cannot join the party for reasons of &#8220;sensitivity&#8221;, so they find the club a useful way of helping their country&rsquo;s cause.<br>
We are always rewarded with a morale-boosting speech from the Chairman and this time he excelled himself. It was astonishing to see him so full of energy and enthusiasm after the unimaginably gruelling week he had just suffered. One point among many caught my attention - he referred to an influential political blog here in the UK which said that we had just crossed a watershed in British politics; &#8221; it was no longer Labour against Conservatives against Liberal Democrats, it was now them against him!&#8221;   </p>

		<p>More arrogance.</p>
<p>The anti-white, multicultural enthusiast writer always pats himself on the back for being smarter than his adversaries.  It&rsquo;s like off-handedly stating, &#8220;Look at me, I&rsquo;m part of the intelligentsia because I oppose &#8216;racism&rsquo; &#8220;.</p>
<p>It consoles him to shout that white nationalists are irrational or &#8220;uneducated&#8221;, an assertion he repeats in almost every column. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Griffin stated his father was in the RAF in WWII and Straw&rsquo;s father was in prison for refusing to serve. That drew a dismissive groan from the panel and the (immigrant) audience&#8221;</p>
<p>I noticed this too. The audience really thought Griffin&rsquo;s comments were inappropriate and he was going off topic/changing the subject. The thing is, what started the conversation, was someone attacking Griffin saying it was wrong for the BNP to abuse the image of Winston Churchill. Calling into question Griffin&rsquo;s patriotism. Griffin responded by saying his father was in the RAF while the other guys father was in prison for refusing to serve. It wasn&rsquo;t one of those immediate zingers, I had to really think about it. It just made me feel uneasy. I don&rsquo;t mean to say this as an insult to the opposition but it may have been a matter of attention span. </p>

		<p>If anyone is wondering how come the &#8216;Question Time&rsquo; audience all clapped or booed in unison it becomes clear when Joel Weiner, the 17 year old Jewish boy was intervied after the show and revealed the truth. Despite the BNP leader&rsquo;s performance, a survey for The Daily Telegraph has shown support for the party has increased in the last month. Joel, an A-level student at the Jews&rsquo; Free School, in Brent, northwest London said that he had applied for a seat in the audience a year ago, before he knew that Mr Griffin was going to be on the panel. He was contacted for interview by the BBC on Wednesday, the day before the recording. Joel, said: &ldquo;They gave me a 10-minute phone interview, and asked me about my politicial affiliations - it was as if they were checking I wasn&rsquo;t going to try and run down to the front and hit Griffin.&#8221; He was told by the BBC to bring his passport and to expect protests. When he arrived he was ushered through a side door and escorted to the studio, where he found an audience united against the BNP leader. He said: &ldquo;There was a spirit of camaraderie in the room that people were able to put politics to one side and unite against Griffin. &rdquo;Joel added: &ldquo;Griffin is a compulsive liar. &#8220;He&rsquo;s a disgusting, abhorrent man. I&rsquo;m glad that he said he doesn&rsquo;t deny the holocaust, but I know he was lying. He only did it to defend himself, to appease the crowd by sounding mainstream.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the show was skewed against him. I think it showed what the public really think, that they are overwhelmingly against him. He had plenty of opportunities to put his view across.&rdquo; The BNP has claimed 3,000 members have signed up since Mr Griffin&rsquo;s Question Time appearance. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand UK politics, but one point intrigues me - Griffin is demonised as a Nazi, racist etc, by so-called &#8216;journalists&rsquo; but not one word is spoken about the Islamic neanderthals who marched in the streets of London demanding the introduction of sharia law.</p>
<p>The Head Islamic Nazi, Choudary, has said that under sharia law in Britain people who commit adultery would be stoned to death.</p>
<p>And that &ldquo;anyone who becomes intoxicated by alcohol would be given 40 lashes in public&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He has also mocked the deaths of British soldiers, and branded an Army homecoming parade a &ldquo;vile parade of brutal murderers&rdquo;. A self styled &#8216;shiek&rsquo; who did exactly the same thing in Australia (as well as sending vile letters to the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan) has been arrested and hopefully will be stripped of citizenship and deported.</p>
<p>Choudary&rsquo;s group&rsquo;s website derides British institutions, and shows a mock-up picture of Nelson&rsquo;s Column surmounted by a minaret.</p>
<p>Is this not planning for the overthrow of the legal government ie, sedition? What, no arrests? No deportations? And the idiots in government can&rsquo;t understand (or pretend not to understand) why the BNP is gaining support?</p>

		<p>What to make of this article? The author raises some much-needed common sense points about Establishment hypocrisy with regards to radical Islam but this is an easy target even for a liberal since it covers religion rather than race/ethnicity. In the end, it&rsquo;s a rather superficial analysis. Even if Middle Easterners aren&rsquo;t violent, religious extremists they still don&rsquo;t belong in the UK because they&rsquo;re non-white and thus can only bring friction and conflict to a traditional white society. This is an utterly common sense reasoning that only a fool or a liberal intellectual would be unable to grasp. But since liberal intellectuals are the vanguards of the Establishment West those in the know must fight to have their voices heard. And Nick Griffin, God bless him, is a fighter. The Council of Conservative Citizens website recently posted a news video which stated that this whole BBC affair has only made Griffin and the BNP more popular, regardless of elite condemnation. It&rsquo;s getting more and more interesting.</p>

<p>This was in response to Straw slating Griffin for saying that Churchill would support the BNP.  Straw then went on to waffle about the &#8220;millions&#8221; of Black and Asian troops who served in WW1 and 2, then started making a speech about the sacrifices &#8220;we&#8221; have all made.  The next day, there was an article in the the Daily Mail, which implied Straws father was a man of morals and integrity for refusing to serve, and Griffins father was some low life cowardly wretch, because he was ground crew, rather than a fighter pilot.  </p>

		<p>To Question Diversity  - who notes that the author Robert Spencer who writes very good books highlighting the dangers of violent Islam, but also slams, smears all nationalist parties in the UK, Europe as RACIST, haters etc.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it goes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much a White Nationalist/populist bends over backwards to say the truth that he doesn&rsquo;t hate Jewish people, isn&rsquo;t a NAZI, was against Germany and German allies in World War II, it&rsquo;s a reflex action - expect to be called a Racist a Nazi, even by supposedly sympathetic Conservative, neo Conservative authors, those who need to work in mainstream politics, media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an unpleasant fact of life that any White person any where in the world who dares to stand up for White people, White Western culture in any way will get called names, smeared as a &#8220;Racist&#8221;. Please give unconditional support to any White who is abused in this way. We will all be abused in the way, get used to it, learn to handle it, make the smears play to your/our advantage.</p>
<p>And Robert Spencer and his kind, if you hate most, all White European people who stand up for our people/culture and who resist the Muslim invasion/occupation - perhaps you would prefer to live and die writing your books in countries like Saudi Arabia, Algeria, the Sudan.</p>

		<p>For those of you who didn&rsquo;t or weren&rsquo;t able to watch Griffin on Question Time, the entire episode is, of course, available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKfrY9l2kY&amp;feature=fvst" rel="nofollow">YouTube here</a> in 6-7 parts. The first part has already been watched by nearly 200,000 people. Do even half that many Americans watch Face the Nation or This Week?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched the entire thing yet, but a few observations come to mind:</p>
<p>1) Griffin acquitted himself quite well. He tripped up his opponents - the sleazy Jack Straw and the black woman wozzername - a couple of times: once when one person claimed that ethnic Britons weren&rsquo;t the indigenous people of the island. He got the time length wrong, I believe (8000 years, not 17000) but the <i>current</i> people of Great Britain are overwhelmingly descended from peoplewho settled there shortly after the glaciers melted away. Madagascar and the South Pacific have both been settled less than 3,000 years; American Indians are, for the most part if not entirely, descended from people who settled there less than 15,000 years ago. By any reaosnable definition, ethnic English, Scottish and Welsh inhabitants are the indigenous peoples of Britain.</p>
<p>2) It was hilariously funny when asshat Jack Straw compared the BNP to Nazis, and talked about the service so many South Asians had rendered to the UK in World War II. Hoist on his own petard when Griffin pointed out that Straw&rsquo;s father, a so-called &#8220;conscientious objector,&#8221; refused to fight the Nazis in World War II. The extremist apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the family tree. (See that exchange in Part 1).</p>
<p>3) I am not by any means thrilled with the BNP. Their sometime anti-gay, holocaust-denying rhetoric is silly and should be renounced by every member of the party, but the fact is that they are the ONLY party that is at all serious about controlling immigration. If I were a UK citizen I would vote for them unapolgetically and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. It&rsquo;s all or nothing now and if British voters don&rsquo;t end immigration NOW their island will be lost forever, or retained only at enormous cost in blood and lucre.</p>

		<p>I wonder how the average Labourite politician would fare on Question Time if he was faced by four hostile inquisitioners, who kept accusing him of being a Communist and asking how often he beats his wife?</p>

You&rsquo;re completely right, it&rsquo;s the perfect &#8216;catch 22&rsquo; situation.</p>
<p>The problem needs a solution, but the accepted solution is completely inadequate. <br>
And required solution is borderline illegal or politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Which means the problem will remain forever until something or someone changes (or breaks) the cycle (or circuit). </p>
<p>Somehow it all seems so simple and so complicated at the same time.</p>

		<p>For the record, Nick Griffin is no longer a &#8216;holocaust denier&rsquo;. He said harsh things about it when he appeared at the Oxford Union.</p>
