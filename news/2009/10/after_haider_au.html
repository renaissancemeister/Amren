<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20091014/INTERNATIONAL-US-AUSTRIA-POLITICS/">After Haider, Austrian Far-Right Could Grow</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Zawadil, Reuters, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year after his death in a car crash, a new memorial to Joerg Haider has become a temple to the man who shook up European politics with his anti-foreigner campaigns.</p>
<p>But where fans flock to the exhibits in Carinthia province to pore over such relics as Haider&rsquo;s childhood rocking horse and family photos, outside the province he ruled for more than a decade, his party&rsquo;s days look numbered.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Austria&rsquo;s Future has stumbled badly in regional elections held since Haider&rsquo;s death, failing to win enough votes to get seats in three provincial parliaments. In Carinthia in March it polled over 45 percent to retain power.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The main center-left and center-right parties have been hemorrhaging votes, weakened by bland, faceless politicians  &mdash;  the two had their worst showing since World War Two in 2008 because of perceptions they were out touch with concerns over the economy and immigration.</p>
<p>The only winners were the far-right parties Alliance and the Freedom Party. Freedom was Haider&rsquo;s original party before he split off to form the slightly more moderate Alliance in 2005.</p>
<p>The original Freedom Party at one point gained such mainstream appeal in the insular Alpine republic, feeding off xenophobia and anti-European Union sentiment, that it entered a governing coalition with the conservatives from 2000-2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Analysts say Heinz-Christian Strache, a vigorous, 40-year-old former dental technician, has been able to build on Haider&rsquo;s legacy using right-wing populism and painting himself as a man of the people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like Haider, Strache goes to discos and is especially attractive to young men without higher education,&#8221; said political analyst Anton Pelinka.</p>
<p>Freedom Party has doubled its share of the vote in two provincial elections earlier this year.</p>
<p>It has performed well since Austria&rsquo;s voting age was lowered to 16. On his website, Strache is photographed in black and white like a movie star and fans can download his rap song, &#8220;Viva HC!&#8221; as a cellphone ringtone.</p>
<p>But Strache lacks Haider&rsquo;s chameleon-like qualities and rhetorical prowess, analysts say, and his party has so far failed to attract the more moderate right-wing voters that opt for Alliance or the conservatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OPPOSITION OR GOVERNMENT?</p>
<p>Alliance may seek to tie up with Freedom to survive at a national polls but Freedom will probably turn them down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Freedom can pick up votes from the dying Alliance party and gain even more support.</p>
<p>Together the two parties captured nearly a third of the vote in the 2008 national elections, two weeks before Haider died at the age of 58.</p>
<p>Still, analysts say Freedom will struggle to enter power at the next national election even if it does absorb the Alliance.</p>
<p>The governing center parties have ruled out cooperation with the far right, which calls for a halt to immigration and a new government department in charge of repatriating foreigners.</p>
<p>In the long term Freedom will have to make the choice between being a haven for protest voters or a party which could enter government by appealing to a wider range of voters and other political parties, essential for coalition-building.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the key line that gives the lie to the pretense of a &#8220;two-party&#8221; or &#8220;multi-party&#8221; system.  When a true alternative to mainstream, EU-approved parties starts winning large proportions of the vote, the supposed &#8220;Left&#8221; and &#8220;Right&#8221; parties band together to render the new party powerless.</p>
<p>The one benefit, though, is that the Freedom Party&rsquo;s success has forced the so called &#8220;center-right&#8221; to show its hand.  Hopefully those voting for the center-right party will see this move for what it is and consider supporting the only true alternative.   </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go all the way: Restore the Hapsburg monarchy! Surely it was the best of the Old European order that was destroyed in World War I, with, sad to say, a big push from Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>Wilson truly hated the Hapsburgs and the multi-ethnic empire. But none of the Hapsburg successor states was ethnically homogeneous. The result was continued ethnic strife without the stability and legitimacy of a benevolent monarch who was above it all and protector of all his peoples.</p>
<p>The resulting power vacuum in Central Europe left the door wide open for fascism and Nazism.</p>
<p>Today, a Danubian Federation woujld be a welcome change to offset the bureaucratic insanity of Brussels: Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia.</p>

		<p>Strache is doing a good job with younger voters, but older voters don&rsquo;t quite trust him as much yet, they feel he yells around a lot and tries a bit too hard to stir up populist sentiment. Haider was definitely better at catering to all age demographics, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of Austrians who agree with the anti-immigrant sentiment 100% but who aren&rsquo;t willing to vote for either of the two right-wing parties yet. Where I&rsquo;m from (Upper Austria) most people vote OeVP (centre-right) almost as a natural reflex action, yet complain all the time about all the Turks and asylum seekers and illegals etc. Still some way to go, but it certainly looks more promising than say in Germany next door.</p>

Such a snooty put-down!  But so what?<br>
The way things are today,  &#8220;higher education&#8221; just means &#8220;higher politicization.&#8221;  <br>
In other words, more extensive brainwashing.</p>

<p><br>
The words are chosen to make Strache&rsquo;s followers sound like the most ignorant, uncivilized element of Austrian society   &mdash;   because according to the Left, only ignorance can explain whites&rsquo; preference for their own kind. This (deliberately deceptive) formulation fails to take into account that lower-income neighborhoods are where Third World immigrants move to   &mdash;   meaning these &#8220;young men without higher education&#8221; have more direct experience with the immigrants. Certainly more experience than the average pro-immigration liberal politician. When it comes to face-to-face daily encounters with Third World immigrants, working-class whites   &mdash;   whether in Europe or N. America or Australia   &mdash;   <i>actually know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</i> </p>
<p>Which of course makes these &#8220;uneducated&#8221; white Europeans LESS ignorant than the liberal politicians who control their fate   &mdash;   or the Reuters writers who sneer at them in print. </p>

<p>#1. Haider was 58 years old, not a crazy, reckless youngster, old enough to be sober and sensible by that age. He was also a responsible and successful person: a self-made businessman and politician, a millionaire, not the sort of person to be behaving irresponsibly. In other words, not someone who wasn&rsquo;t in control of his life.  He was also an expert driver, in an expensive high-performance automobile; and he was not known for drinking.</p>
<p>#2. He was on his way to his mother&rsquo;s home to attend her birthday party.  What 58-year old man would be drunk and speeding recklessly on the way to visit his mother for her birthday?</p>
<p>#2. He had openly come out, on Austrian television, just a couple of weeks before his death, squarely blaming the banking/financial interests that were behind the world-wide financial crisis which was beginning to afflict so many nations.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m still shocked by the number of non Austrian children in Vienna. I read something like 50% of the school children were the children of immigrants. It sounds like Vienna may be the next Londonistan. It&rsquo;s also interesting that the BBC tried to imply that Haider was Gay after his tragic death and they did it in a pejorative way!</p>

<p>In Austria, immigrant doesn&rsquo;t mean non-white, like in Germany. Germans (including Ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe), Swiss, Italians, former Yugoslavians and Central Eastern Europeans are immigrants as well.</p>
<p>The biggest non-European group is Turks, like in the other German speaking countries. Not too many blacks, exempting drug dealers (mostly Nigerians) in Vienna. </p>

Exactly. It could be used that way within the meaning of the word. It&rsquo;s isolated  (from <i>insula</i>: island).  I have no problem with it.<br>

		<p>Pim Fortuyn of the Netherlands was openly gay and pointed out the obvious contradiction between western tolerance for sexual deviance and Islamic intolerance. It&rsquo;s not only culturally conservative people who should fear the Muslims. More and more the old left in Europe is becoming the new right. The working class whites are the ones who can&rsquo;t afford to live in gated communities and are increasingly ditching labour parties for Lega Nord or BNP. I think its time we find allies wherever we can. Besides, &#8220;tolerating&#8221; the gays doesn&rsquo;t mean one APPROVES. European gays aren&rsquo;t nearly as obnoxious as North American ones&hellip; if someone figures out why, I&rsquo;d love to know. </p>

<p>My response is a little late so you&rsquo;ll probably never read it but I agree with your sentiment. And I think I have an answer to your question. Every minority or special interest group in America has been politicized and radicalized. After all, the Left in America is a coalition of militants.</p>

<p>The Liberal-Minority Coalition has capitalized on catering to the disgruntled minorities.  And if they weren&rsquo;t disgruntled enough, it made sure to TELL them how oppressed and abused they were. </p>
