<h1>Sometimes, Learning Can Get Lost in the Translation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lou Michel, Buffalo News, October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Patrick Flatley was eager to study math when he enrolled at the University at Buffalo.</p>
<p>But he says he encountered an unexpected obstacle that had nothing to do with complex formulas.</p>
<p>The Elma resident could not figure out what his math instructor was saying  &mdash;  because of the teacher&rsquo;s heavy foreign accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t understand the teacher, so I dropped the course before the first exam so I wouldn&rsquo;t be penalized,&#8221; Flatley said. &#8220;It was very upsetting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A year later, the 19-year-old, who aspires to become an accountant, says he is taking the same calculus and statistics course and getting high marks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a teacher with a New York City accent, and I have an &#8220;A&rsquo; so far,&#8221; Flatley said. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t tell me there aren&rsquo;t teachers out there who can&rsquo;t speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatley&rsquo;s situation illustrates a language barrier that sometimes occurs at UB, which welcomes students and instructors from all over the world.</p>
<p>But the global perspective comes at a price for some students who struggle to understand international professors and teaching assistants whose accents, pronunciation and, in some cases, misuse of words result in knowledge getting lost in the translation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our intention to internationalize the campus. In their future careers, students will have to interact with people from all over the world and be able to understand their background and even their accents,&#8221; said John T. Ho, interim vice provost for graduate education.</p>
<p>Attracting high-caliber educators from around the world, Ho added, benefits the United States economically and competitively, noting that several of the 2009 American recipients of the Nobel prizes in medicine, physics and chemistry were immigrants.</p>
<p>But inside the classrooms and lecture halls, students told The Buffalo News, they face linguistic challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re in a lecture hall with 300 people and you&rsquo;re not sitting up close, it&rsquo;s hard to understand,&#8221; said Tony Scrace, a senior from Lockport majoring in international business and world trade. &#8220;I have two international teachers, one is from Haiti and the other is Asian. They speak broken English. The words are not the same and sometimes their presentations have grammatical errors in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other universities and colleges find it necessary to turn to the global labor pool because Americans with advanced degrees often seek better paying jobs in private industry rather than education, according to a spokesman for the American Association of University Professors in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a result, he said, universities have long grappled for long periods with complaints that faculty who speak English as a second language sometimes have difficulty communicating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For more than two decades, classes have been provided at UB for teaching assistants who need to improve their language skills, according to Keith E. Otto, who heads UB&rsquo;s English-as-a-second-language program, one of the first in the country.</p>
<p>Those unable to clearly speak English, Otto said, are given duties outside the classroom, such as grading papers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohan&rsquo;s experiences</p>
<p>Satish Mohan, the Amherst town supervisor who plans to return to his post as a professor in UB&rsquo;s Engineering Department in January, says he is not without sympathy for students who say they have difficulty understanding what&rsquo;s being taught.</p>
<p>A native of India, he said he has encountered international educators at UB who have struggled with their English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohan is not alone in recognizing that difficulties exist in getting concepts across when there is a language barrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a loss, I will admit that,&#8221; said Qi Dong, a UB economics doctoral student from China who works as a teaching assistant. &#8220;For me, some questions are very abrupt, and I&rsquo;m not perfectly prepared for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aaron Hargrave, a UB nuclear medicine technology graduate, said teaching assistants are often responsible for helping students grasp complicated information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teaching assistants, Dong says, have an obligation to thoroughly familiarize themselves with course material in order to get the main points across to students who seek their help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think that 80 to 90 percent of the information can be transferred,&#8221; he said, adding that students should make use of office hours and study groups to succeed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American-born students, Snyder [Martin D. Snyder, spokesman for the American Association of University Professors in Washington, D.C.] added, need to embrace diverse education environments, if they want to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though the students sometimes deny it, they are resistant to someone from a different culture, someone from a different educational background,&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;They are so narrow and parochial that they can&rsquo;t open up to that person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spinoff benefits</p>
<p>Scrace, the international business student, says non-American professors do enrich course material.</p>
<p>&#8220;They bring a lot to the table in respect to business aspects from other parts of the world. Some have worked for years outside the United States and travel two or three times or more a year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They definitely know what is going on in their home regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unintended benefit, Snyder says, is that students who seek each other&rsquo;s help in study groups often do better than those who go it alone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ernesto J. Alvarado, acting president of UB&rsquo;s undergraduate Student Association, says he is aware of the language difficulties but says there is no question the university&rsquo;s professors are top notch in their academic fields.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Providing another perspective, UB engineering student Robert G. Urtel questioned why he has to pay tuition if he is expected to teach himself when a professor can&rsquo;t speak English clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m being personally cheated out of my tuition money,&#8221; said Urtel, a junior. &#8220;You have to read the book, try and learn it on your own and work with other students going through the same thing.&#8221;<br>

<p>I can only imagine how daunting it must be to try and assimilate vital technical information that is delivered garbled and unintelligible.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In some cases, misuse of words&hellip;&#8221; I had an Iranian Computer professor who was lecturing on the function of baffles in hard drives to help heat &#8220;escape&#8221;. I walked up on break and told him that in Hot-Rod parlance the term used was dissipate. His eyes opened wide  and he walked away from his  desk muttering, &#8220;Dissipate, Dissipate, Dissipate!&hellip;&#8221; About twenty minutes later he leaned over and whispered in my ear, &#8220;You know you have an A now, no matter what&#8221;. I told him I considered it a fair trade between a guy that knew nothing about computers and a guy that knew nothing about America&hellip;</p>

		<p>As someone who had a relatively weak math background, I had to drop a class with a teacher like this to preserve my GPA. I just have to wonder, is is racist for students in Louisiana to say that they cannot understand a teacher from New York? Or if the teacher was from Germany or France? The definition of &#8220;racist&#8221; has gotten really out of hand. </p>

		<p>The same happened to my son. There was no way the students could understand their teacher/instructor. It was one of those technical schools where they had to get student loans to attend&hellip;of course trying to get that loan off the books when my son could only take it for one week and quit, was nearly impossible. This was 25 years ago! They were PC even then. They finally took it off his credit report and the government &#8220;forgave&#8221; the loan after my son has fought it for all these years! He even notified the government agency in charge of these loans to these &#8220;technical&#8221; schools of the problem way back then, so as to maybe closing down that class or at least get another instructor and of course never got a reply. So more of our tax dollars down the rat hole.</p>

		<p>A couple of years ago I went to the freshman orientation with my son at UNC-Charlotte pursuant to institutional instructions. A full 75% of the Freshman orientation weekend focused on obnoxious presentations of issues related to diversity/radical politics/LGBT issues/&#8221;different learning styles&#8221;/economically disadvantaged students, personal behavior expectations, etc. 25% was devoted to the core technical aspects of university matriculation and courses of study. I can only assume that an essentially identical freshman orientation session is delivered system wide in the UNC University system.</p>
<p>But the big surprise at one of the parent orientation sessions was a rather detailed and emphatic discourse on &#8220;the student&rsquo;s right to have his academic experience delivered in intelligible standard English&#8221; and the process for academic ajudication and remediation related to foreign professors. My son transferred to another school after his freshman year without having to deal with a LEP professor, but it still gives pause to think that such a session would be necessary at a freshman orientation.<br>

		<p>I would like to make three points.<br>
#1. I am from Massachusetts. As a freshman in college, I had a lab partner who was from Mississippi. Turned out to be a great guy and a good friend. But for the first two months, I, very embarrassed, kept asking him to repeat himself because I didn&rsquo;t know what he was saying.<br>
#2. Have you ever tried to understand a Scotsman?<br>
Nevertheless, aside from the humor,<br>
#3. Isn&rsquo;t it the responsibility of the teacher to be able to communicate with the students?<br>

<p>No, it is not narrow or parochial to want a teacher you can understand clearly. If they can&rsquo;t be understood, they shouldn&rsquo;t be teaching. Students or their parents pay good money for these classes and it&rsquo;s essential they understand the instructor. If they can&rsquo;t, they are being cheated out of what they paid for. Would this professor Snyder want a foreign doctor explainging something to him about his upcomimg surgery or treatment that he couldn&rsquo;t understand? I rest my case!</p>

		<p>I remember taking a geography course in university, and the lab teaching assistant was this fellow from China (graduate student) who mangled the English language more effectively than what a bear could do to a chipmunk. It was impossible to understand him, and he would throw temper tantrums when we pointed out the obvious - that he was unintelligible (I guess the looks of frustration on our faces told him that his message wasn&rsquo;t coming through).</p>
<p>But for me, the crowning insult was on my graduation day. The Faculty of Graduate Studies, crammed with foreign students, had gone up to receive their degrees just before my class. And the white guy announcing the graduates and handing out degrees managed to pronounce every one of their &#8216;weird sounding&rsquo; names perfectly. And then it was my turn. I&rsquo;m a WASP male, with a name to boot - as English-sounding as you can get. And the announcer flubbed the pronunciation! I guess that&rsquo;s when I had my first real cultural/ethnic awakening.<br>

		<p>Mmmmmmm Interesting. While In college years ago, I had a Physics lab teaching assistant who was from some part of Indonesia. His english was so bad and accent heavy, it was impossible to understand a word.</p>
<p>After two labs, our lab class went to the professor and basically said enough. Get rid of him. He was replaced with a German TA who had a much better command of English. This was in the early 80&rsquo;s, well before PC, diversity etc. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see what would have happened these days.<br>

		<p>White Schoolteachers are expected to crawl on the floor to make simple arithmetic accessible to the foreign kids they give us, but White college students are expected to grasp complex subjects presented in semi-English.  It comes down to that, Whites are expected to do all the work in communicating with non-Whites.</p>

<p>This is pure horse feathers. America and it&rsquo;s students were more successful in the first 6-7 decades of the 20th century when this country was overwhelmingly White. How is adding unintelligible third world citizens making us better? If their contributions are so essential, how come they aren&rsquo;t making their own countries better places?</p>
<p>In all of the above examples, the foreign teacher was non White. My personal experiences with foreign teacher is mixed. I studied Italian under a woman born and raised in Italy. Her English was broken but I had no problem understanding her. In contrast, I had a physics professor who was Vietnamese. His accent was so thick and his grammar so poor that I had to drop the class and enroll in another section with an English speaking teacher. </p>
<p>College students shouldn&rsquo;t have to decipher poorly spoken English to get an education. Some course are difficult enough even with an articulate well trained professor. Our universities don&rsquo;t need instructors who speak like they have a mouth full of marbles.</p>
<p>From the article:<br>
&ldquo;It is our intention to internationalize the campus. In their future careers, students will have to interact with people from all over the world and be able to understand their background and even their accents,&rdquo; said John T. Ho, interim vice provost for graduate education.<br>
Wrong again Hop Sing. They will only need a translator to understand their gibberish.</p>

<p>   What is left unsaid is that many undergraduate classes are taught by foreign TA&rsquo;s for very little money. These Teaching Assistants are almost indentured servants, and every college or university uses them to cut costs. The need for diversity is actually an excuse for ruthless economics. Unfortunately, most TA&rsquo;s receive little training and have poor English skills. Many lead a twilight existence in the United States never becoming citizens but never leaving the university. I know some who have been TA&rsquo;s for over ten years.</p>

		<p>I have a scenario with the shoe on the other foot. In Kuwait I was tasked with trying to teach Indians how to service, repair and operate power generators! they were repeatedly getting shocked by 415v military generators until I refused to attempt to teach any others unless they did speak good English. My reasoning was, if one of them was killed, my company was not going to take the blame but would blame me..So I have learned a thing about Indians, Pakistanis and such, they don&rsquo;t understand 3 things in life, HYGEINE, SAFETY and GRAVITY! One need only be in Kuwait a week or so to understand what I mean, anyone been?</p>

		<p>In university, I had an economics professor from West Africa. He was very hard to understand.  Among his various linguistic idiosyncracies was one word that he repeated often, but that I found impossible to understand: it sounded like &#8220;uh-BYOO-dins&#8221;.  It took me quite a while before I realized he was trying to say &#8220;abundance&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ernesto J. Alvarado[&hellip;]says he is aware of the language difficulties but says there is no question the university&rsquo;s professors are top notch in their academic fields.</p>

		<p>SKIP: A while back I posted a link to an article on Africa&rsquo;s mystifying electricity shortage since decolonialization: http://tinyurl.com/nhnoyz.  The whole thread is here: http://tinyurl.com/yjz7jny.</p>
<p>The article says that rather than invest in infrastructure, countries such as Uganda lease enormous diesel generators.</p>
<p>I was wondering if in the lease contract, (non-African) technicians are generally included on a stand-by basis to keep the generators running, or if they are flown in as needed.</p>

		<p>When I was in college, I had a &#8220;professor&#8221; in anthropology who looked like Redd Foxx and sounded just like Ricky Ricardo. Oddly enough, I didn&rsquo;t have much trouble understanding him, as I was able to make out what he was saying, and then wrote my notes.</p>
<p>He got his BA in anthropology from the U. of Madrid, before Franco came to power. He was a professor at my school even though he never got his PhD. That&rsquo;s because, he wrote many articles and books on archaeology, and was on dozens of expeditions, from what I understand.</p>
<p>To Sardonicus:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why universities love foreign students, and teaching assistants. Not only do they cut costs, but they actually make money in three different ways:</p>
<p>1. Foreign students are charged higher tuitions, since they&rsquo;re non-residents. That&rsquo;s the first way universities are making money.</p>
<p>2. Foreign students are ineligible for financial assistance, so the schools make money there. The more foreign students a school has, they save on financial assistance money.</p>
<p>3. They raise tuition every year, for all students. The foreign student rate is higher, of course. I don&rsquo;t think the forreign students really mind it either, since their governments pay the tuition bill. That&rsquo;s the third way.  </p>

		<p>I work in a job that requires communicating engineering material with the Japanese. They are very smart and are good workers. However, communication is very difficult. There is much added time preparing detailed presentations, on both sides, to get the message across without translation errors. Cultural differences make communicating uncomfortable. Of course, their holidays fall on different days as ours, which interrupts work flow. Working with alien cultures is stressful, depressing, and counter-productive. Especially when you realize that there are out of work Americans engineers that share your language and culture.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. If the Puppet Masters have their way, very few whites, meaning only the Puppet Master&rsquo;s children for the most part, will be allowed to go to college anyway. And those kids will get kid glove treatment, with top grades handed to them and falsified test scores if need be - just as has been going on with these people for years. Meanwhile, the working class whites, the few left, will have to toil to pay taxes to ensure the education of non-whites from here and abroad so they can be obedient little cogs in the NWO machine. </p>

		<p>Wow, glad to have seen this article.I thought it was only me who had this experience. In the early 1990&rsquo;s I almost went to a public university for accounting. I declined, after meeting the instructors. They were from India, and had accents so thick I couldn&rsquo;t understand them.I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being in a course in which I HAD to do very well. I was also uncomfortable in talking with them, even without the accent. I ended up going to school elsewhere. </p>
