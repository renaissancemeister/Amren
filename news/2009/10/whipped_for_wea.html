			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hardline Islamist group in Somalia has begun publicly whipping women for wearing bras that they claim violate Islam as they are &#8216;deceptive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The insurgent group Al Shabaab has sent gunmen into the streets of Mogadishu to round up any women who appear to have a firm bust, residents claimed yesterday.</p>
<p>The women are then inspected to see if the firmness is natural, or if it is the result of wearing a bra.</p>
<p>If they are found wearing a bra, they are ordered to remove it and shake their breasts, residents said.</p>
<p>Al Shabaab, which seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Sharia law over all Somalia, also amputated a foot and a hand each from two young men accused of robbery earlier this month.</p>
<p>They have also banned movies, musical ringtones, dancing at wedding ceremonies and playing or watching soccer.</p>
<p>&#8216;Al Shabaab forced us to wear their type of full veil and now they order us to shake our breasts,&rsquo; a resident, Halima, told Reuters, adding that her daughters had been whipped on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are now saying that breasts should be firm naturally, or just flat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Officials of Al Shabaab, which Washington says is Al Qaeda&rsquo;s proxy in the failed Horn of Africa state, declined to comment.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s hardline interpretation of Islamic law has shocked many Somalis, who are traditionally moderate Muslims. Some residents, however, give the insurgents credit for restoring order to the regions under their control.</p>
<p>Al Shabaab, which means &#8216;youth&rsquo; in Arabic, control large swathes of south and central Somalia.</p>
<p>Abdullahi Hussein, a student in north Mogadishu, said his elder brother was thrown behind bars when he fought back a man who humiliated their sister by asking her to remove her bra.</p>
<p>&#8216;My brother was jailed after he wrestled with a man that had beaten my sister and forced her to remove her bra. He could not stand it,&rsquo; Hussein said.</p>
<p>Men were not spared the &#8216;moral cleansing&rsquo;. Any man caught without a beard was been publicly whipped.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was beaten and my hair was cut off with a pair of scissors in the street,&rsquo; Hussein said.</p>
<p>&#8216;My trouser was also cut up to the knee. They accused me of shaving my beard but I am only 18.</p>
<p>&#8216;They have arrested dozens of men and women. You just find yourself being whipped by a masked man as soon as leave your house.&rsquo;<br/>

<p>How many of the Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s; the Garafolo&rsquo;s&rsquo; Susan Sarandans (sp?)and their ilk have you read who decry hysterically the evils and inflexibility of Christians?</p>
<p>Quite a few, as have I, and there are many men who do the same as well.</p>
<p>Now, how many of these same types have you heard condemn Muslims and their religion for their fanaticism, which makes the most rabid Christian follower pale by comparison?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the SPLC fanatically condemning the street protestors against this administration, warning of the possibility of violence from them, encouraging law enforcement to beware of them.</p>
<p>Yet Muslim jihadists are blowing themselves up, as well as our buildings and are caught frequently in the midst of a plan to bomb or machine gun innocent civilians, and they amount to a considerable number of religious fanatics.</p>
<p>Not one word, though, from the SPLC, the ADL or the ACLU on the dangers they pose.  They don&rsquo;t even regard these groups as hate groups.</p>

		<p>I find it ironic that if you look at most African flags, or necklaces, or proud clothing worn by blacks, the horn of Africa is almost always missing. Check it out. It&rsquo;s like they are so proud to be &#8220;African&#8221; yet they don&rsquo;t even include Somalia on the garments. Kind of interesting in a way. I guess being a pirate doesn&rsquo;t pay like it used to. Now Western ships are shooting back, so they gotta attack their own again for having big breasts. </p>

<p>&gt; Yes, this reminds me of the Middle Ages in Europe when Christian Inquisitors would strip a woman naked to search for a mole, even shaving the private parts until one was found so that the alleged witch could be condemned as one and &#8220;purified&#8221; by fire.  I have long been of the opinion as a result of years of study, that most, if not all of the Inquisitors were sadists who explored all the ways that flesh could respond and reveled in it.  Denial of our real nature always produces frustration and perversion.  </p>
<p>It is much healthier to find an outlook that does not deny our humanity, but seeks to manage it intelligently.  Epicurean philosophy is interesting and arose in ancient Greece via philosopher Epicurius.  How many times must we re-invent the wheel?<br/>

<p>Are you sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about? First, the witch hunts are a thing of the Reinassance and early modern period (that is between the 15th and 17th centuries), not the middle ages.</p>
<p>Second, hunting witches was not the job of the Inquisition. The Holy Inquisition existed only in Spain and Portugal and their colonies, regions not known for witch hunts (which happened primarily in Central Europe, and secondarily in France and England). The main object of the Inquisition was to combat Muslims and Pagans who pretended to be Christians, not witches. </p>
<p>As for the statement that &#8220;denial of our nature produces perversion&hellip;&#8221; If you&rsquo;re commenting here, chances are that you&rsquo;re a White advocate and a racial realist. That puts you outside the Leftist anti-White, anti-Western civilization, conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>You should ponder that platitudes such as &#8220;denial produces perversion&#8221;, are integral part of the very same conventional wisdom that is designed to slander and destroy the glorious past of the West. They reasoning behind this is that Christianity is White and Western, Christianity is for continence and marriage fidelity, therefore continence and marriage fidelity are White and Western and therefore evil.</p>
<p>I myself am an atheist, but I have only respect for pastors and priests who represent our glorious tradition. Have you ever spoke to one? Do they seem perverts to you? To me, the actual perverts are the effeminate, sex-obsessed, sado-masochistic &#8220;gay pride&#8221; types.</p>

		<p>Besides, Epicurus is not at all about the gratification of our impulses, which is what the said &#8220;gay&#8221; perverts usually intend to advocate when they rant against repression and &#8220;denial of our nature&#8221;.</p>
<p>Epicurus wrote explicitly that the satisfaction of sexual urges never brought happiness to anyone. His &#8220;intelligent management&#8221; of our humanity included a strict avoidance of unnecessary pleasure.</p>
<p>Also, back to the witches&hellip; the typical &#8220;witch&#8221; was ancient, repulsive. (I invent nothing, this is what the sources say). I don&rsquo;t think that the witch hunters were really venting their repressed sexual urges when they investigated those ugly old &#8220;witches&#8221;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have no sympathy for the witch hunters.</p>
<p>But certainly they were not sexual perverts. Among the other things, the majority of those who denounced a &#8220;witch&#8221; were women, so certainly you won&rsquo;t say that their motivation was sexual repression! Similarly, I suspect that envious flat-chested women are very involved in the persecution of Somali bra wearers.</p>
<p>A century ago, even though nobody believed in witches any longer, nobody would have argued that witch hunters were sexual perverts. Neither would Epicurus have believed it. That such interpretation is so widespread today is a case of projection - a sign of the perversion of OUR time.</p>

To &ldquo;Whiteplight&rdquo; who wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long been of the opinion as a result of years of study, that most, if not all of the Inquisitors were sadists who explored all the ways that flesh could respond and reveled in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about? First, the witch hunts are a thing of the Reinassance and early modern period (that is between the 15th and 17th centuries), not the middle ages.</p>
<p>&gt; Wrong, the first witch hunts occured in the Middle Ages in England and were part of the cause of the Peasant&rsquo;s Revolt of 1380.  Witch hunting went into full swing because of supersitious ideas as to the causes of the Black Plague in the 14th century.  The Inquisition was formed in the 13th century by Dominic Guzman to persecute the Albigensian &#8220;Cathars,&#8221; not Muslims.  Jacques de Molay and the Templars were similarly, judged, tortured and burned by Inquisitors. Joan of Arc was condemned as a witch during the 100 years war, by the Inquisition.  I refer you to such texts as The Witches Hammer, the guide of the Inquisition and the Cornell University published Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology.  It is history of witch hunting from the early middle ages, finishing in New England with the Salem Witch Trials.  I think it is you who are not fully informed.</p>
<p>To the contrary, the era of witch hunting paused and deminished everywhere in Europe except Spain, but arose again, famously, in New England.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, hunting witches was not the job of the Inquisition. The Holy Inquisition existed only in Spain and Portugal and their colonies, regions not known for witch hunts (which happened primarily in Central Europe, and secondarily in France and England). The main object of the Inquisition was to combat Muslims and Pagans who pretended to be Christians, not witches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong, The Inquisition was very active in France and Germany, especially southern Germany.  You ought to read up on the history, the Idea of the Inquisition being only Spanish is one of the initial major modern misconceptions of European History.  The Cornell University text I list above contains all this, but there is a huge amount of other material on this. </p>
<p>&#8220;As for the statement that &ldquo;denial of our nature produces perversion…&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re commenting here, chances are that you&rsquo;re a White advocate and a racial realist. That puts you outside the Leftist anti-White, anti-Western civilization, conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>You should ponder that platitudes such as &ldquo;denial produces perversion&rdquo;, are integral part of the very same conventional wisdom that is designed to slander and destroy the glorious past of the West. They reasoning behind this is that Christianity is White and Western, Christianity is for continence and marriage fidelity, therefore continence and marriage fidelity are White and Western and therefore evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; As for the repression of our biological nature, this is a matter of simple psychology, and well understood by most.  The claim and idea that only Christianity has been a force for stabilizaiton in the West is a huge misconception and a tragic one in my historical view.</p>
<p>&#8220;I myself am an atheist, but I have only respect for pastors and priests who represent our glorious tradition. Have you ever spoke to one? Do they seem perverts to you? </p>
<p>&gt; Wowee, where have you been!  How many minister perverts and priest pedophiles do you need to have exposed before you get the picture.  The church has always been a good home for sexual deviants and homosexuals.  I don&rsquo;t know where you live, but I lived in Europe for a while and did a lot of field study.  There are endless examples of homosexual monks and nuns, not to mention the walls of nunneries and monastaries filled with the skeletons of unwanted newborn.  </p>
<p>&#8220;To me, the actual perverts are the effeminate, sex-obsessed, sado-masochistic &ldquo;gay pride&rdquo; types.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perversion is as perversion does, I do not make distinctions of identity but indentify by activity.</p>
<p>I disagree that pastors and priests represent our &#8220;glorious past.&#8221;  Only the most biased or incomplete interpretation of our history could make such a conclusion.  Christianity is not a European relgion, it conquered Europe though violence and terror.  It is actually those who had to word in secret, deal with an retrogressive clergy, Catholic or Protestant, to develope the technology and science that actually provided the impetus for the rise of the West.  And it was the great rebellious writers who caused the mind to think.  The printing press was repressed, the idea of universal literacy was fought, etc., etc.  As for the wealth of Europe, Jews were the ones who opened the West to trade and supplied the kings and nobles with the silks, spices, and banking services that allowed for the eomomies of Europe to rise out of the fuedal state.  The only college of medicine in the Middle Ages was in Montepellar and was staffed mostly by Jews.  But whenever a king or the church had painted themselves into a corner politically or financially, they turned on the Jews.  I don&rsquo;t think you really know what you are talking about at all.</p>
<p>Europe had its own indigenous religions that served the people well before Christianity came.  They lost their fight against the advance of the Roman Church because it was simply a new version of the Roman Empire and more organized and powerful, as well as more politically astute.  </p>
<p>I do not require any religion for my personal solace, but I understand that most do.  I always argue that what Whites need is a new relgion modeled after the old relgions that bound the people to their lands.  They had wonderful marriage ceremonies and life affirming attitudes that connected people to their land and their human nature.  Christianity teaches nothing about race preservation, but rather seeks to take in every person on earth, regardless of race, ethnicity, or status.  Christianity takes people from their land and sets up a dichotomy that impels them to sacrifice themselves and give themselves up.  This is the main reason for the plight of whites today.  This is why I can be noticed often pushing the idea of a new sort of &#8220;Old Relgion&#8221; for whites, rather than a falling back into the same old nonsense that held Whites back and ultimately authors their destruction.</p>

<p>SKIP:</p>
<p>I too looked at this as a clarion call for the US and probably a death knell for Europe and the UK.  It may not be long until reports such as this come out of the UK, Europe or eventually the US (or probably not as censorship and Hate Speech legislation silences anyone with notions of Free Speech or the First Amendment; for parts of Europe it is already too late).  This is the &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; obama&rsquo;s handlers promised the people of the United States.</p>
<p>I fear it is too late for Britain.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders recently, correctly proclaimed: &ldquo;Islam itself is the problem!&#8221; (NOT JUST what the msm-filters call &#8216;radical islam&rsquo;). He went on to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;We have to stop the mass immigration from Muslim countries. Because more Islam means less freedom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Somali &#8216;refugees&rsquo;, Professor Lynn reports:  &#8220;Somalis have 5.0 children per woman, more than three times the number of children as whites.&#8221;  And, as demographics is destiny, how long will it be before the following is reality?:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A hardline Islamist group in Lewiston, Maine has begun publicly whipping women for wearing bras that they claim violate Islam as they are &lsquo;deceptive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The insurgent group Al Shabaab has sent gunmen into the streets of Lewiston to round up any women who appear to have a firm bust, residents claimed yesterday&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, you can substitute London for Lewiston.  Professor Lynn also writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;By 2001, the number of asylum seekers from Africa in Britain was 480,000, an increase of more than fourfold over a period of only 20 years. As word spreads through Africa that entry to Britain is easy and life much better than in Africa, the numbers are likely to increase further&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/lfejst</p>
<p>Then, yesterday, out of Britain came this report (was anyone surprised?):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Huge increases in immigration over the past decade were a deliberate attempt to engineer a more multicultural Britain, a former Government adviser said yesterday.</p>
<p>Andrew Neather, a speechwriter who worked in Downing Street for Tony Blair and in the Home Office for Jack Straw and David Blunkett, said Labour&rsquo;s relaxation of controls was a plan to &#8216;open up the UK to mass migration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ministers hoped to change the country radically and &#8216;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yzlzrkr" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yzlzrkr</a></p>
<p>The British politicians who allowed this atrocity to happen to the native peoples of the UK are evil  &mdash;  and lefty politicians in the US are not far behind.  My home state of Kalifornia has been over-run and ruined by open, unfettered, unstopped immigration from the fecund Third World.  </p>
<p>Let Kalifornia be your clarion call.</p>

		<p>White Plight I have a feeling you are correct in the alienation within people due to organized Christianity. Its a remarkably complex subject and although I&rsquo;m a believer because of things I&rsquo;ve experienced&hellip;not because of a need.. again I agree there is an unnatural sterilization of individuality as well as an unhealthy guilt of eros. I just ordered what looks like a very interesting read ..&#8221;The golden thread of time&#8221; by Crichton Miller.. If you haven&rsquo;t read it it might be worth a gander. Concerning the Jews opening Europe to wealth.. I think Greece and Rome had wealth on their own,.. didn&rsquo;t they? Of course the Jews being a very talented group I&rsquo;m sure contributed in different era&rsquo;s. Concerning the Jews&hellip; or the Hebrews.. I find it impressive that their whole mythos or cosmogony was based on a love of higher justice, that of the supreme singular mind of the universe. I think this Religious fervency helped sculpt their intelligence, yet it still allowed even incorporated the maintainance of their racial component.</p>

Well, I&rsquo;ve written a very long answer. It is final. I spent too much time on this and don&rsquo;t want to carry on the discussion forever. I will read your reply, but will not go on.</p>
<p>Since the Malleus was indeed written by inquisitors,  I recognize you&rsquo;re right about using the word &ldquo;inquisitors&rdquo; in your previous comment. But I feel ill at ease that you believe I never heard about the Cathars and so on. That is not the case. I&rsquo;m no historian, but I&rsquo;m not completely and hopelessly uninformed, either. I know about the Medieval Inquisition (and by the way the court that judged Joan wasn&rsquo;t exactly what we usually call the Inquisition, but this is a technicality). But I was under the impression that it didn&rsquo;t exist any longer by Renaissance time, and that by that time the only existing Inquisitions outside the Papal States,  were the Spanish and Portuguese ones.  I also assumed that even though you used the word Middle Ages, you meant the Renaissance period, and that&rsquo;s why  I stated that the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions were the only ones by that time (and yes, they were about Muslims and pagans).</p>
<p>Usually when people talk about persecution of witches, they don&rsquo;t refer to Joan of Arc or extraordinary disorders triggered by the Black Plague. Systematic and large-scale persecutions happened mostly in the modern era. The Hammer book, from which I immagine you derive your information on witch persecution technicalities, dates back only to the late 15th century (more Renaissance than middle ages), and it was the beginning of the large-scale persecution of witches, together with the coeval Papal Bull that authorized such persecutions. So I&rsquo;m probably right that you were talking about the witches of Renaissance time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the repression of our biological nature, this is a matter of simple psychology, and well understood by most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to the sixties, psychologists considered homosexuality a disorder. This state of things ceased, not because research was done that showed homosexuality healthy or &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, but simply because of homosexual political pressure. The same kind of pressure that erased all the science about the races.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perversion is as perversion does, I do not make distinctions of identity but indentify by activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly, I know a few gay people and they are not healthy people. Perversion is something that harms first of all, the person who does it. Gay people have a shorter lifespan, are more likely to get AIDS by an enormous margin, tend to make bad choices such as taking drugs, committing crimes, and in general to live self-destructive lives. They also are likely to kill each other and rape teenagers. Gays try to deny the intrinsic association of gaydom with AIDS, violence, pederasty and pedophilia (exactly like black people deny that they are prone to crime and so on) but statistics say otherwise, and NAMBLA used to take part in gay events and demonstration back in the seventies. </p>
<p>&ldquo; How many minister perverts and priest pedophiles do you need to have exposed before you get the picture. The church has always been a good home for sexual deviants and homosexuals. I don&rsquo;t know where you live, but I lived in Europe for a while and did a lot of field study. There are endless examples of homosexual monks and nuns, not to mention the walls of nunneries and monastaries filled with the skeletons of unwanted newborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suspect that allegations of priest pedophilia are often false and motivated by money, but this is beside the point; I have no difficulty in admitting that there are homosexuals and pederasts in the Church. In part it&rsquo;s the same personality traits that can bring one either to have a gay lifestyle or to be a religious person. That these homosexuals sometimes act as pederasts proves my point that homosexuals tend to be perverts. However, a person who has homosexual tendency and gives his life to religion, tends to be immensely more sane and healthy (and less likely to rape kids) than one who lives the gay lifestyle. That is obvious if you compare the behavior of priests with that of the general gay population.</p>
<p>So I stand by my point that those who aggressively spread the notion that repression breeds perversion (not you, but the ideologues and political sponsors of the meme), are often perverts themselves. What Christianity is about is not repression, but sublimation that is expression of energies in a different way.</p>
<p>Also, I insist that you misunderstand Epicurus. I already pointed out that for Epicurus, true happiness and true pleasure do not come from gratification of sexual desire. All the epicurean man needs is food, shelter, and knowledge that everything else is unnecessary and mostly to be avoided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity is not a European religion&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christian doctrine comes from Europeans like Paul (arguably the greatest shaper of the religion), Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther and countless others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it conquered Europe though violence and terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the armies of the Pope conquered and pillaged Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia and Poland! I must have missed that. What you usually read in ancient chronicles is that the Church sent missionaries, not raiding parties (except perhaps when it comes to Lithuania).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is actually those who had to word in secret, deal with an retrogressive clergy, Catholic or Protestant, to develope the technology and science that actually provided the impetus for the rise of the West. And it was the great rebellious writers who caused the mind to think. The printing press was repressed, the idea of universal literacy was fought, etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read quite a few historians and thinkers who made the reverse case. Christians monks who copied books made a lot more to spread knowledge than the printing press later on. The Church sponsored peace among Christians which made progress possible. Above all, it sponsored universities. Many Papal Bulls conferred special freedoms to univesities. Most of the great Western thinkers weren&rsquo;t necessarily rebellious or heterodox when it came to religion. I think you&rsquo;ve read a lot of very biased and oversimplifying leftist authors, which is quite frequent given the dominant leftist ideas of this historical era.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the wealth of Europe, Jews were the ones who opened the West to trade and supplied the kings and nobles with the silks, spices, and banking services that allowed for the eomomies of Europe to rise out of the fuedal state. The only college of medicine in the Middle Ages was in Montepellar and was staffed mostly by Jews. But whenever a king or the church had painted themselves into a corner politically or financially, they turned on the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here in Italy there was plenty of bankers who were not Jewish. The Spanish crown turned to Genoese Christian bankers after having expelled the Jews. And what is your point about physicians, exactly? Christianity certainly didn&rsquo;t discourage medicine. Monasteries worked as hospitals, and copied books on medicine; medicine was taught at Christian universities (when was it that it only was taught at Montpellier? Surely not in the late period); it&rsquo;s a myth that the Church prohibited corpse dissection. Many doctors were Jewish simply because Jews are smart and are naturally inclined to certain professions including medicine. To understand this, consider that a different degree of interest in medicine has always been a differentiating factor between Northern and Southern Europe. Even today, the South has more doctors per capita than the North. Jews are even further along the same scale – they adore medicine. It&rsquo;s racial, it has nothing to do with religion.<br/>
Jews certainly played a part in the wealth of Europe, but it&rsquo;s silly to claim that they were the exclusive or even the most important influence. Not even in opening the trade with the East. Marco Polo was no Jew. The Genoese who turned a small village in Crimea into a huge port metropolis from which to ship Eastern goods, were no Jews. The Crusaders who mastered the Levant, making trade possibile, were no Jews. The many diplomats sent by the Pope to the Mongol Empire were no Jews. I&rsquo;d rather say that unity among Christians, sponsored by the Church, made trade with the East possibile.</p>
<p>Also, you forget the most important thing. Christianity united Europe against the Muslims. No chapter in our history is more glorious than the Crusades (as well as the Reconquista, as well as the Pope-sponsored resistance against the Ottomans).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not require any religion for my personal solace, but I understand that most do. I always argue that what Whites need is a new relgion modeled after the old relgions that bound the people to their lands. They had wonderful marriage ceremonies and life affirming attitudes that connected people to their land and their human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pre-christian religions weren&rsquo;t always beautiful. There&rsquo;s an account of a Norse (to be precise, one that took place among pagan descendants of Norse living in what is now Russia) funeral, which show that these wonderful  pagans burned the living wife of the deceased together with the deceased. The people who practiced those beautiful religions also practiced slavery, which was universal before the Church prohibited the enslavement of Christians. And of course the wonderful Greeks and Romans were pederasts and more generally, had a disgusting view of sex exclusively based on dominance and submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity teaches nothing about race preservation, but rather seeks to take in every person on earth, regardless of race, ethnicity, or status. Christianity takes people from their land and sets up a dichotomy that impels them to sacrifice themselves and give themselves up. This is the main reason for the plight of whites today. &ldquo;</p>
<p>I disagree that Christianity is the main reason for this. Anti-White ideology is the final incarnation of progressivism, liberalism, leftism. The various Christian churches, fought against progressive ideologies like lions. Christianity used to be considered a great fortress of reaction. Now progressivism, that is leftism, (mostly) defeated Christianity and swallowed it up, and that&rsquo;s why you have anti-White third-world-ism among Christians. It wasn&rsquo;t like that in the past. Christianity taught that black people have a soul, which is not a bad teaching at all, but it never taught to hate and loathe one&rsquo;s own race. It never was against defending one&rsquo;s own group. That is something that comes from the Left, a deeply anti-Christian force.</p>
<p>We are not Pre-Christian people. You say that pederast priests are perverts; a pre-Christian person such as a Greek or a Roman would have found pederasty acceptable. Even when we are atheists or non-Christians, the fundamental values of our civilization are the Christian values. We can take them or reject them, in which case we are left, not with the possibility to start something new, but simply (in the long run) with nothing. </p>
<p>You speak as if you could start a whole world religion anew, which of corse you can&rsquo;t do, not just because you don&rsquo;t believe in the supernatural, but also because, it&rsquo;s something only five people in history managed to do.</p>
<p>I advise you to abstain from attacking Christianity at least for strategic reasons. If you bring down Christianity, what you&rsquo;re helping is not White nationalism, but atheism of the nihilistic (and therefore prone to leftism) variant. You may not see the immediate connection between atheism and the destruction of the white race. But it&rsquo;s there. Go to any university, which is inevitably dominated by atheistic nihilism, and try talk about race. Also, ask a large number of white nihilist atheists how many children they have. White nihilists tend not to reproduce themselves, and they tend not to be loyal to anything. It&rsquo;s an inner attitude.<br/>

		<p>One more point I can&rsquo;t resist making. Look at Islam. Just like Christianity, Islam teaches that all people in the world can and should be Muslims. There&rsquo;s no difference between the two religions&rsquo; universalist attitudes. Does it follow that the various Muslim ethnicities don&rsquo;t have an extremely strong sense of their own separate identities? Does it mean that Arabs don&rsquo;t loathe Muslim Blacks?</p>
<p>Christianity used to support an aristocratic social order. It was never a part of Christianity to make all men equal in this world - only in the other world. It&rsquo;s socialism and its offshots that started insisting on equality in this world.</p>

		<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think even present-day Christians are as inevitably pro-immigration as you seem to believe. From the blog of Larry Auster I recently read that the American evangelical movement developed a strong opposition to amnesty.</p>

		<p>In a previous comment i mocked the idea of a Papal military conquest of Europe. Now reading it again, it is an ambiguous sentence because, obviously, the Pope endorsed many military endeavors. But the point I was trying to make is that when you say that Christianity was imposed with violence and terror, you suggest a military conquest of Pagan nations that never happened.</p>
<p>Christianity conquered the Roman empire peacefully from within - it was already the dominant religion when Constantine made it official. The various Germanic nations that conquered the Western empire, were already Christian when it happened. Britain was converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries, not by conquest. Russia converted to Christianity without ever being conquered by a Christian nation. The Scandinavian countries converted to Christianity without ever being conquered by Christian nations. Your words about Christian &#8220;violence and terror&#8221; suggest an idea of military conquest of Europe that never took place. Christianity triumphed because it won hearts and minds.</p>

		<p>I also didn&rsquo;t touch a very important point (and now I admit I failed in my intention to make the long comment up there my last one). Glory is not only measured in science, wealth, or military success. You lived in Europe - did you see a few Gothic cathedrals? the Sistine chapel? Did you read the Divine Comedy? Virtually every single book written, song composed, and building built, in the last two thousand year bears the marks of Christianity. That is the history and tradition we have, not that of Greek or Norse paganism. Do you want to reject all that?</p>

		<p> &#8220;Italian&#8221;  Good rebutal Paisano, Honestly Its refreshing to read intelligent.. point, counterpoint discussion amongst transcontinental Europeans concerning cause and effect of our declines or strengths&hellip; to revitalize ourselves this is a healthy remedy that as I see it was missing and allowed social illnesses to manifest.</p>
