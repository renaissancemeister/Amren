			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Stelter, New York Times, October 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CNN&rsquo;s broadcast of a four-hour documentary about Latinos this week turned into a political rallying cry for activist groups that are calling on the cable news channel to fire Lou Dobbs, a veteran anchor with anti-immigration views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} One of the activists featured in the documentary said on Wednesday she tried to bring up what she called Mr. Dobbs&rsquo;s &#8220;hatred&#8221; on one of the channel&rsquo;s news programs, but that her remarks were cut from the interview.</p>
<p>Isabel Garcia, a civil rights lawyer who was featured in the documentary and organized a protest against Mr. Dobbs in Tucson on Wednesday, said that she felt censored by CNN after the channel edited her comments about the anchor out of an interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said she called Mr. Arpaio [Sheriff Joe Arpaio] and Mr. Dobbs &#8220;the two most dangerous men to our communities,&#8221; and added that &#8220;because of them, our communities are being terrorized in a real way.&#8221; {snip}</p>

<p>Oh, no, Ms Garcia.  It you wish to abuse English, it is they, illegal immigrants, who are the terrorists.  They came here, uninvited.  And they remain here unwanted and a grievous burdon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see how watching Lou Dobbs on TV can influence anybody to &#8220;terrorize&#8221; anyone else. The word is being applied far too loosely in this instance. When it comes to racial/ethnic whining, these victimization pimps will say just about anything!</p>

		<p>Pro-Hispanic immigration&hellip;legal and illegal&hellip;.by Hispanics is an example of what the whiners declare as &#8220;racism&#8221; nowadays, if it is whites advocating for European immigration.  Like all dull-witted non-whites they stupidly believe their biases should be overlooked.</p>
<p>Just once I&rsquo;d like to see an in depth documentary outlining pro- Hispanic and pro-black racism, showing examples of blacks and Hispanics who are in favor of nothing except what they believe is beneficial for their race and their race only.</p>
<p>Non-white biases and &#8220;racism&#8221; will continue on unabated until the system hits overload or the economic issue or another hot button item causes an implosion, afterwhich there will be some serious battle lines drawn.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a farce and an unnatural situation that none of the racial groups really like.  Following natural instincts, each race pursues only those things that protect, secure and advance the interests of, only their own respective racial tribes.</p>
<p>Even without the coming of the second huge economic hit on the country, the entire West could not endure as nations, nor could they avoid chaos and riots, which have been fomenting the minute large numbers of aliens settled into their societies.</p>
<p>It can be accurately stated that multicultural societies are all ALWAYS in a PRE-WAR mode, simmering until the final explosion. </p>

CNN has gone off the deep end with diversity. I&rsquo;ve seen a steady stream of non-whites hosting new segments. The whites at CNN, excluding Dodd, are overwhelmingly pro-diversity and anti-white. They express shock, horror, and outrage at any alleged incident of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Good.  Terrorize them until they decide or are forced to leave.  That&rsquo;s what they deserve.</p>
<p>My wife is a LPR, and we both waited for her to come here legally.  I get really tired of activists for illegals sobbing about how bad illegals are treated here.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s so bad here, why don&rsquo;t they go home?  I&rsquo;ll even by an illegal family a bus ticket back home.</p>
<p>Besides, Lou Dobbs is not &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221;.  I also get tired of people like him getting slandered with that label.  Lou Dobbs and Sheriff Joe Arpaio are not anti-illegal, and I don&rsquo;t even believe they are racists.  They just want our immigration and other laws enforced, and so do I.</p>
<p>Plus and end to Black African and Arab/Muslim immigration.  That would be nice too.</p>

		<p>Well, if you weren&rsquo;t harboring illegals, you wouldn&rsquo;t feel terrorized.  Arpaio is a real American hero and border defender.  Illegal immigrants and their coyotes are the criminals, not Arpaio.  Isabel Garcia should go to Mexico and try to talk to the cartels about &#8216;civil rights&rsquo;. Maybe she&rsquo;ll see how well she and &#8216;her community&rsquo; have it here in the USA.  </p>

		<p>Wonder if CNN will show the savagery of &#8220;Latinos In America&#8221; of the gang rape and beating of that 15 year old girl in Richmond that lasted almost 3 HOURS! Suspects are ALL &#8220;latinos&#8221;&hellip;.not to mention even more watched and taped it as this went on for hours! </p>
<p>Come on CNN, you cowards, show the TRUTH about these &#8220;latinos in America&#8221;&hellip; I detest most of our yellowbelly media in this country! They even had an article about this rape in the press in IRAN! </p>

		<p>A few facts:<br>
Most illegals are supplemented with taxpayer benefits, do not learn the language and fail to assimilate into our culture.<br>
Some of the costly benefits are: AFDC, food stamps, school lunches, Emergency Room medical(In Los Angeles 60 hospitals have closed their  emergency rooms), WIC, public housing and Supplemental Security Income.  <br>
Illegals also qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>
<p>The children of illegals account for nearly all the growth in elementary and secondary school enrollments.</p>
<p>Isabel Garcia, a civil rights lawyer, said Joe Arpaio  and Lou Dobbs are &ldquo;the two most dangerous men to our communities,&rdquo; and added that &ldquo;because of them, our communities are being terrorized in a real way.&rdquo; <br>
I think Lou and Joe are doing great jobs and I seriously hope they continue. The  only people being terrorized are the American Taxpayers.  <br>
 The illegals are costing our country billions and destroying our culture and Ms. Garcia wants to portray them as victims.</p>

		<p>The lynch mob mentality against Lou Dobbs is utterly insane. Dobbs insists US law be enforced. He is outraged that citizens pay for the welfare of noncitizens. </p>
<p>This legitimate alarm is designated as racist, even though Dobbs&rsquo; uncovering of the illegal immigrant racket includes Chinese and other, nonHispanic illegals, including white illegals. Several Presidents didn&rsquo;t enforce immigration laws. So we have spoiled brats with a sense of  &#8220;entitlement&#8221;. </p>
<p>Anyone who falls in the way of the illegal lobby is a racist. Thus Dobbs must go. A lynching which the MSM will no doubt join, along with our oh so liberal President who lusts after Latino votes.</p>

		<p>Does this woman realize how many Americans have been terrorized by illegal aliens? Try Mrs. Bologna, who lost her family to an illegal alien. How about the widow of the police officer in Houston, killed by an illegal. Ask her about the thousands of legal, law-abiding citizens who have been killed, raped, molested and robbed. She needs to be deported along with Luis Gutierrez and all the traitors in this country who think they are entitled to instant citizenship so they can continue to bring their criminal actions to this country. No thanks. We have enough home grown criminals.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange that unlike previous immigrants who attended night school to learn English, that this group objects to learning English while they speak Spanish, not an indigenous language, the language of the Spanish Conquistadores who conquered Mexico and enslaved its inhabitants?  Should they not rebel against speaking Spanish and speak an indigenous language, especially in their own country?</p>

<p>Lou Dobbs does NOT have anti-immigration views. To the contrary, Lou Dobbs is pro-immigration. However, Lou Dobbs is anti-illegal immigration. The sentence I quoted above is a blatant lie by the New York Times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;&hellip;because of them, our communities are being terrorized in a real way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hispanic immigrants should not feel &#8220;terrorized&#8221; if they followed our laws and came here legally. Obviously, this idiotic, so-called civil rights activist is talking about illegal aliens. Perhaps she is an illegal alien herself, hence her sympathy for other illegal aliens.</p>

<p>Unlike you I believe it is about race. I do care about the race of legal and illegal immigrants. I am not afraid to admit it or say. It is the TRUTH. </p>
<p> It is NOT about hating one over the other. It is about our own survival and keeping our own nations OURS! What is wrong with that? Do you see any of the nonwhite nations taking in millions of immigrants not of their own race? Haven&rsquo;t you ever thought about that? Why is that okay and it isn&rsquo;t okay for us? </p>
<p>White nations are the ONLY nations that have been brainwashed with this idiocy. This country was founded BY Whites FOR Whites, like it or not. Just because you have nonwhite relatives does not make it okay for the rest of us to go along with it.</p>
<p>As for assimilating, just what does that mean exactly? Can other races assimilate?  I don&rsquo;t think so. Not really. Just look at all the Mexican Americans that supported and supports all their illegals simply because they are Mexicans. The same with blacks and the Asians, I might add. They go against Whites any chance they get over EVERYTHING. They ALL stand with their own and we know it. It is only the Whites that do not stand for/with their own. Do we not read this even on Amren in the archives and daily?  Different races don&rsquo;t assimilate, only one&rsquo;s racial kin truly assimilate.</p>
