			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like, October 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It must be said, Black people love the idea of instant gratification. Take for instance Black athletes who hit the genetic lottery jackpot and make it to professional sports. Seven figures or more quickly pouring into a newly created bank account makes for an impressive trip to the strip club for a joyful  &mdash;  yet soon to be dolorous  &mdash;  session of &#8220;Making it Rain&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet, Black people find these avarice-induced downpours of Benjamins an expensive deluge of momentary monetary showering, for money only begets more money when it is put into a savings account and not into the G-String of some random girl:<blockquote>&#8220;Via Half Sigma, we learn the factoid that 3 out of 5 former pro basketball players are broke within a half decade of being out of the game. The typical NBA player makes millions of dollars and has a two digit IQ. That&rsquo;s a recipe for trouble  &mdash;  both overspending and getting scammed by advisors.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Sports Illustrated, the magazine that is for Black people what Popular Mechanics is for white people, recently ran an interesting article that talked about How Athletes Go Broke. If you read between the lines, the article is largely about Black people in athletics who after winning the genetic lottery go out and splurge with the fervor of a sixteen-year-old girl with her daddy&rsquo;s credit card: <blockquote>&#8220;What happens to many athletes and their money is indeed hard to believe. In this month alone Saints alltime leading rusher Deuce McAllister filed for bankruptcy protection for the Jackson, Miss., car dealership he owns; Panthers receiver Muhsin Muhammad put his mansion in Charlotte up for sale on eBay a month after news broke that his entertainment company was being sued by Wachovia Bank for overdue credit-card payments; and penniless former NFL running back Travis Henry was jailed for nonpayment of child support.</p>
<p>In a less public way, other athletes from the nation&rsquo;s three biggest and most profitable leagues  &mdash;  the NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball  &mdash;  are suffering from a financial pandemic. Although salaries have risen steadily during the last three decades, reports from a host of sources (athletes, players&rsquo; associations, agents and financial advisers) indicate that:</p>
<p>* By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress because of joblessness or divorce.</p>
<p>* Within five years of retirement, an estimated 60% of former NBA players are broke.<br>
</blockquote>Does pointing out this unpleasant of financial irresponsibility strike SBPDL as utilizing Hate Facts to make a point? {snip}</p>
<p>Only seven states in the nation don&rsquo;t have lotteries, as the prospect of quick millions is an enticing idea entertained by millions of people who hope to duplicate the spending capabilities of pro athletes whom they enjoy spending vast times watching on television.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent study conducted at the University of Georgia discussed the HOPE Scholarship  &mdash;  created through lottery revenue for Georgia students to go to college in the state for free  &mdash;  and brought forth some interesting data:<blockquote>Third, lottery play is heaviest among African Americans (National Gambling Impact Study Commission 1999, p. 3-4). Clotfelter (1979), Clotfelter and Cook (1987),Borg and Mason (1988), Hansen (1995) and Price and Novak (2000) all argued that lottery expenditures are disproportionately higher for African Americans than for whites.</p>
<p>Stranahan and Borg (1998) argued that although African Americans were not more likely to play than whites, conditioned on playing, they spend much more on lottery tickets than whites.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shows that lottery sales per capita are much larger in counties with a large share of African Americans than with a small share. The bottom three quintiles spend $201, $201 and $200 per person, per year on lottery tickets, which contrasts sharply with the upper two quintiles (over 36.1% black) that spend $250 and $402 per person on lottery tickets. The quintile with the largest share of African Americans purchases lottery tickets at twice the rate of those in the lowest three quintiles.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>So Black people trying to get rich quick  &mdash;  who weren&rsquo;t blessed with athletic skills or who spent on the money they earned thanks to those athletic skills  &mdash;  purchase an inordinate amount of lottery tickets, thereby allowing white people to attend school for free: <blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you decide you&rsquo;re going to fund public activities with a lottery, you are going to be funding them on the backs of people who tend to be lower income and people with less education, which in the South also means disproportionately black,&#8221; says Christopher Cornwell, a professor at UGA&rsquo;s Terry College of Business who&rsquo;s extensively studied HOPE. &#8220;That&rsquo;s just a reality.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>{snip}<blockquote>Among other things, the results showed:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Blacks made up 19.7 percent of the state&rsquo;s adult population but accounted for 23.2 percent of lottery players and 38.4 percent of frequent players.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  People in households earning under $40,000 accounted for 28 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, 31.3 percent of lottery players and 53.4 percent of frequent players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  People who said they have no Internet access made up 29.6 percent of the total population, 30.2 percent of lottery players and 41.1 percent of frequent players.</p>
<p>Asked for his explanation of those statistics, Passailaigue [Ernie Passailaigue, lottery director of South Carolina] said in an interview last week, &#8220;There are certain traditional lottery games that are offered that appeal more to minority populations, and those are specifically the three-digit game and the four-digit game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawings are held daily in Pick 3 and Pick 4 games. The winning numbers in daily games often are used as the basis for illegal gambling, Passailaigue said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Carolina&rsquo;s 2008 lottery study showed that more than 50 percent of Pick&nbsp;3 and Pick&nbsp;4 players were black.</p>
<p>Dale Charles, president of the Arkansas branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he believed Passailaigue&rsquo;s assessment was far from accurate. The state lottery director does not want to admit the real reason why blacks play the lottery frequently, Charles said.</p>
<p> &#8220;The reason why black people play it is because they are trying to make their lives better for themselves and their families,&#8221; Charles said. &#8220;But they are failing to realize (the) chances of winning aren&rsquo;t so great. We think, &#8216;This is going to be the time,&rsquo; and we get hooked on it and we just keep playing and keep playing and keep playing until it becomes an addiction.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Black people want to be rich, and instead of long-term wealth creation an epidemic of short-term financial growth strategy permeates throughout the Black community, well, everywhere the lottery is played (even in Obama&rsquo;s Chicago): <blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>Predominantly African American or Latino, low-income Chicago communities have generated the highest lottery sales in the state, shows an analysis of Illinois Lottery records since 1997 by The Chicago Reporter. In addition, residents in these communities spent a higher portion of their incomes on the lottery than people in more affluent areas. And despite the state&rsquo;s recent economic downturn, lottery spending has increased, the Reporter found.</p>
<p>In the South Side&rsquo;s 60619 ZIP code area, lottery players spent more than $23 million on lottery tickets in fiscal year 2002, more than any other ZIP code in the state, according to lottery sales records. The 60619 area includes parts of the predominantly black neighborhoods of Chatham, Avalon Park, Burnside and Calumet Heights.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it seems the data overwhelming highlights yet another Hate Fact that few will admit is important to discuss, for instant gratification affects one community more than others. Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like includes losing the lottery, for the reality is that Black people play the lottery more than other races, and though they lose, they keep playing the lottery in a game that even Sisyphus wouldn&rsquo;t try, even if the Gods ordained him too.<br>

		<p>I have mixed feelings about lotteries.  On the one hand, they&rsquo;re a tax on the mathematically ignorant.  But on the other hand, they&rsquo;re by far the best chance the average person has to get rich.</p>
<p>That blacks love to play lotteries I think is representative of the first axiom rather than the second.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no surpise lottery play, per capita, is higher where there is a large African American population - lottery play by whites, that is. I&rsquo;m sure alcoholism, depression and suicide rates are much higher there too. </p>
<p>The State lottery offers a much better chance at winning than do the legally-allowed ripoff private facilities that have gambling.</p>

		<p>Gambling is often called a &#8220;tax on stupidity.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Maybe this could be a strategy for getting more honest media discussion of &#8220;hate facts&#8221;: list stupid, destructive behaviors and publish profiles of who does them.<br>

		<p>Interesting piece, though hardly surprising.  Financial irresponsibility is just one more facet of irresponsible behavior among black Africans, from their incredible promiscuity and infidelity, rampant drug use, criminal behavior which is a huge multiple of that of whites and Hispanics combined, and chronic inability to plan for a future.</p>
<p>This is all due, of course, to white racism.</p>

		<p>I buy one ticket a week, because well someone has to win, but often I am in line behind minorities buying $50 worth.  If they invested $50 a week in something a little more lucrative they&rsquo;d be doing well.</p>

		<p>This is a really great piece.  I recently moved to Georgia, and every day I drive to work through the ghetto.  All along the street you see the Unholy Trinity of the ghetto  &mdash;  a check cashing place next to a liquor store next to a place that sells lotto tickets.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it occurred to me that blacks must be the ones paying for white kids to go to college with the HOPE scholarship.  So it was nice to read that people had done empirical studies to prove this.  I hear no discussion of this fact among progressives.  I guess it would involve an acknowledgment of the self-destructive behavior of underclass blacks and so cannot be discussed.  </p>

		<p>Karl Marx said &#8220;religion is the opium of the masses&#8221;, but I can see that in this day and age, lottery is the opium of the masses.</p>
<p>I purchase about one  ticket each, for two particular lotteries in my home state of Pennsylvania every week, but I do not  go overboard.  Even though the odds are extremely against winning if you are a muggle(non-magical person the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; novels), I would need to either build a time machine, or open up the other 90% of my mind to create good luck, in order to seriously think about winning.</p>
<p>When it comes gambling, drinking, smoking, and other such adult activities, it should be up to the individual to decide what to do.  However, many blacks, Hispanics, and poor whites regularly buy lottery tickets, in far greater excess than I do, because it does provide a far-fetched day dream of temporary relief, like religion, drug use, drinking cheap alcohol, or watching TV.</p>

		<p>This touches on something that&rsquo;s been made law in a few states, but hasn&rsquo;t seemed to catch on for reasons I don&rsquo;t understand  &mdash;  that is to use a portion of lottery winnings among welfare recipients to reimburse the state for its largess. </p>

		<p>This is not a new thing, of course. </p>
<p>In old-time minstrel and song sheets, you would often find the numerical phrase Four Eleven Forty Four or 4-11-44.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, &#8220;The roots of this enigmatic phrase can be traced to the illegal lottery known as policy in late 19th century America&hellip;&#8221; It was so often participated in by blacks that it came to be associated with them.</p>
<p>Just goes to show, I guess, that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

		<p>Critics of the lottery act as if the poor i.e. minorities, wouldn&rsquo;t squander their money away on some other frivolity if the lottery ceased to exist but would spend it on text books, business suits and wise investments.</p>
<p>If the poor waste their money chasing improbable dreams that is their right, it is not the most harmful or expensive vice one could have and the money goes to a good cause (lowering my taxes!). Doing away with the lotto would only benefit organized crime which would be all to happy to fill that void.</p>

		<p>Years ago I read in &#8220;Liberty&#8221; magazine that you really did get something for your lotto dollar: the excuse to daydream about sudden great wealth.  I can&rsquo;t deny it, it&rsquo;s a fun fantasy.  &#8220;There you go, Mr Jared Taylor, enough money to buy two minutes of air time at the next Super Bowl.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>When I worked in a rural town as a policeman about 15 years ago, just about every black you arrested had &#8220;ball tickets&#8221; on their person. (And corn liquor in the car, somewhere, but that is another story&hellip;)</p>
<p>Different colored markets would have these tickets, and it would operate as a &#8220;butter and egg&#8221; lottery. But every low-class black in that town had them. In fact, the only ones I recall who lived in town that were not pretty darn low-end (typical uneducated colored pathologies) were some preachers, a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy, a barber who was also a bail bondsman, and the jerk who is mayor of this town now.  And I will bet (whoops!) that they had something to do with it, too!</p>
<p>Just an improvident cultural thing amongst the uneducated.</p>

		<p>@ people who say the lottery doesn&rsquo;t make sense:  Would you wager everything you own for a 2% chance of winning 100x the value of everything you own?  After all, the payoff would be 2/1.  Also, I guess you guys don&rsquo;t have insurance, since odds are that you&rsquo;ll lose money?</p>
<p>Anyway, the lottery makes sense, so long as you spend a small amount, such that losing that amount doesn&rsquo;t affect your lifestyle.  The only people I&rsquo;ve seen spend &gt;$5 on lotto tickets are blacks.</p>

		<p>In Georgia the lottery helps fund the Hope Scholarship, which pays for students to attend college. My grandchildren have attended college using it. I LOVE for blacks to play the lottery; I don&rsquo;t care how poor they are. If they haven&rsquo;t got sense enough to buy food or shoes or medicine before they buy lotto tickets, tough noogies.</p>

		<p>   I used to work routes in black neighborhoods . I had a good job but with a wife and two kids completely dependent on me, my pay didn&rsquo;t seem to go far . It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon to see blacks younger than we were, living in a new house or doublewide with two new sub-compacts in the yard . I instinctively knew they were one way or the other on the lam with the tax payer . This was in the 1980s . I voted against the lottery on the grounds it was another tax and from Washington on down to the smallest municipality they are about to strangle the goose that has layed the golden egg with runaway taxes . But it passed anyway, and now these young African-Americans on my routes who inexplicably were living better than I could, are now, for the first time, paying their fair share of taxes . And that is good .</p>

Everything you probably suspect of going on between the government and the minorities is probably happening . While we complain and blow off steam, the minorities are calmly training their armies of lawyers and activist, working behind the scenes and are successfully disfranchising us, based solely on our ethnicity .  <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just the blacks dumping $50 at a time on lottery tickets.  It&rsquo;s the spending habits so many of them have.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was stuck in traffic in Torrance California.  Ahead of me, I saw sunlight glinting off something.  It turned out to be the first set of spinner wheels I had ever seen.  The car with them pulled into the same parking lot where I was going. Out steps a black man, woman, and three kids.  The kids were dressed in dirty, torn clothing. Naturally, the car was only about 2 years old, it had those spinner wheels, and the man and woman were dressed in designer-label duds I could never afford.</p>
<p>Then again, I am putting money away each month.  They on the other hand likely had credit cards with 21% interest rates.</p>

		<p>There is little here which doesn&rsquo;t verify what we don&rsquo;t already know. </p>
<p>Africans as a rule have a much shorter time horizon than other people, have weaker ability to defer immediate gratification, and have poor impulse control. Of course, the &#8220;something-for- nothing&#8221; promised by lotteries is going to be attractive to them (along with the (smaller) percentage of people of such character and mentality in other racial groups). </p>
<p>This, however, shouldn&rsquo;t excuse limiting,still less prohibiting, such forms of personal entertainment for those who can gamble, use drugs, or engage in private sexual conduct (whether gay or straight) thoughtfully and responsibly.</p>
<p>Whites also shouldn&rsquo;t have to be burdened with the consequences of widespread nonwhite irresponsibility and indolence either!</p>
