<h1>Arizona Sheriff Vows to Continue Immigration Sweeps Despite Federal Downgrade</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOX News, October 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A firebrand Arizona sheriff known for his hard-line immigration enforcement is vowing to press ahead with an illegal immigrant sweep Friday, defying a revised Department of Homeland Security policy that takes away his federal authority to make such arrests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not gonna stop,&#8221; Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said in an interview with FOXNews.com. He said the federal changes amount to a political hit job and that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement won&rsquo;t take illegal immigrants off his hands he&rsquo;ll personally drive them to the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing will change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to be deterred by any bully.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government stripped Arpaio of part of his federal authority to enforce immigration law by changing its rules under a program allowing local police to enforce those laws. Under the changes, Arpaio&rsquo;s jail officers would still be able to check inmates&rsquo; immigration status but would not be able to make federal immigration arrests on the streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio claims he still has authority to make the arrests under state human smuggling laws and other provisions, regardless of whether he&rsquo;s charging the suspected illegal immigrants of any other crimes. He said that if ICE won&rsquo;t take his suspects, he&rsquo;ll drive them down to U.S. border patrol agents. If they don&rsquo;t take them, he said, &#8220;I assume they won&rsquo;t accept any illegals.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Arpaio is notorious among immigrant rights groups for his treatment of suspected illegal aliens once in custody. He is known for clothing inmates in pink underwear, making them work on chain gangs and subjecting them to other harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has been investigating his office over claims of discrimination and unlawful practices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio remains defiant. He said he&rsquo;s glad to be able to conduct immigration sweeps without having to follow federal guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&rsquo;t stop this sheriff. I don&rsquo;t report to the feds. I report to the people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They should give me a medal  &mdash;  shouldn&rsquo;t be the Nobel Peace Prize, but it should be something.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think Sheriff Joe is only going after those persons who are felons under Maricopa county law and are illegal. Felon + illegal. And he has the authority to do as he intends to do. That is a big plus under the federal system. NO one authority in Washington ruling and lording it over everyone. We have sovereign authority at a lower and independent level. </p>
<p>That pink underware, the convict uniforms, the tents, the chain gang is much overdone anyhow. Chain gang only for those that are non-violent offenders, not escape risks, and in jail for three to six months max.</p>
<p>And they do get fed baloney sandwiches at lunch time when they are on chain gang. And womans chain gang too so there is no possible basis for discrimination complaints.</p>

		<p>Look folks, we in Maricopa Country (metropolitan Phoenix Plus) have serious problems with illegal aliens.  They are disproportionally involved in all levels of crime, they are a highway menace, they overload the public schools with non-English speakers, they freeze teenagers out of all the entry level jobs etc. etc. - just think of a locust infestation of a citrus farm.<br>
Sherriff Arpaio and County Attorney Thomas are the only law enforcement willing to nix political correctness and try to deal with this continual influx of illegal aliens corrupting the civil society.<br>
Janet Napolitano ran interference for the illegal aliens at every opportunity when she was Governor and now she is doing essentially the same as head of DHS.<br>

		<p> Although I live in Yavapai County Az., Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s continued operations in Maricopa are a real help to us. Every election we hope someone of his caliber will run for office here.<br>
 Having been a guest of Joe&rsquo;s (for a brief time) I can tell you it&rsquo;s not his policies that make it miserable - it&rsquo;s the illegals and their substandard lifestyles that make a stay in Maricopa County Jail the worst experience imaginable. But I found mexicans to be most like coyotes: tough in a crowd, but chicken to stand 1 on 1.</p>

		<p>I am so glad that Sheriff Arapio is finally doing this remarkable thing and it is actually arresting these Mexicans and hopefully they will stay there until they will never find our borders interesting.  Maybe if we have all these type sheriffs around the country they will arrest illegals and illegals in America (whatever their ethnicity, unless non-European, and even then, unless Eatern Bloc and Irish).  The Eastern Bloc countries are not white in my opinion or are the Irish.</p>

		<p>@Cherokee Patriot:</p>
<p>You mean that Polish people aren&rsquo;t white?  I&rsquo;m half Polish/Russian.  Eastern European is a branch of the Caucasian race as far as I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Polish/Russian on my father&rsquo;s side, Anglo with a touch of Cherokee on my mother&rsquo;s, and I consider myself to be a white American.  I sure look white.</p>
<p>Back on the subject:  I believe Arpaio is a patriot.  Maybe he ought to have the illegals hole up in his tent city for a while so they won&rsquo;t WANT to come back!</p>
