<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/22762/20091020/">Sweden Democrat Leader Reported for &#8216;Hate Speech&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul O&rsquo;Mahony, The Local (Stockholm), October 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An opinion piece by Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Åkesson in which he labels Muslims a major threat has been reported to Sweden&rsquo;s highest legal official by the Centre Against Racism (Centrum Mot Rasism).</p>
<p>The anti-racism organization called on the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern  &mdash;  JK) to examine whether claims made by the head of the far-right party were tantamount to agitation against an ethnic group (hets mot folkgrup).</p>
<p>Åkesson&rsquo;s article, published in Aftonbladet on Monday, has provoked a furious reaction following the Sweden Democrat chief&rsquo;s assertion that the spread of Islam represents the country&rsquo;s &#8220;greatest external threat since World War II&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are of the view that the article agitates against Muslims when it points at Islam as the greatest threat to Sweden,&#8221; said Mariam Osman Sherifay, head of the organization and Social Democrat politician, to the TT news agency.</p>
<p>Osman Sherifay was also highly critical of Aftonbladet&rsquo;s decision to print the article, a move she said was out of step with established journalistic standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The newspaper is giving the Sweden Democrats space that they don&rsquo;t deserve. The fact that they&rsquo;re racists is not news. Aftonbladet could instead have examined the party&rsquo;s views,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Osman Sherifay&rsquo;s political rivals, the conservative Christian Democrats  &mdash;  currently the smallest of the four parties in the governing centre-right coalition  &mdash;  were also quick to shoot down Åkesson&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;My understanding of media reports from the weekend&rsquo;s Sweden Democrat conference was that they wanted to broaden the party and show that they have more strings to their bow than just xenophobia,&#8221; said party leader Göran Hägglund in a written comment to The Local.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when they formulate this opinion piece all we get once again are sweeping accusations portraying an ethnic group as a threat, all of which is based on facts that are dubious to say the very least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tempers have flared between the two parties in recent months as the battle heats up for the conservative vote. A number of opinion polls have indicated that the Sweden Democrats are closing in on the four percent threshold necessary for representation in the Riksdag as the Christian Democrats struggle to keep their heads above water.</p>
<p>Relations between the two reached perhaps their lowest ebb during the summer when the Christian Democrat leader accused the Sweden Democrats of failing to shake off their Nazi past. But this didn&rsquo;t stop Åkesson from weighing in recently on Hägglund&rsquo;s side as the latter slammed Sweden&rsquo;s &#8220;cultural elite&#8221; for their purported antipathy towards &#8220;regular people&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Hägglund, who has called on the established parties to tackle the Sweden Democrats head on, was keen to reiterate his view that the Christian Democrats have little in common with their challengers from the far-right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Theirs is a viewpoint that places the value of human life on a scale. Some are worth more than others. The way their party views human life is light years away from both my own view and that of my party,&#8221; he said.<br>

     &#8220;Their&#8221; viewpoint is the only human one.  Does Hagglund not value his own child&rsquo;s life above a stranger?  His mother above my mother?  Were Sweden to go to war with Spain, would he not prefer that more Spaniards died than Swedes?  Why is he a Swedish politician, if not to advance the well-being of the Swedish people?  <br>

While the Sweden Democrats rightly and unashamedly prefer to advance the welfare of native Swedes, you and your <i>förrädare</i> (traitors) manifestly value Third World Asian and African invaders more than you do native Swedes, so much so that you would knowingly sacrifice the well-being, the future and the very lives and freedom of your fellow Swedes for the sake of this immigrant riff-raff.  Your pious pretence of believing in &#8220;human equality&#8221; is no more than a transparent and revolting sham.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think individual countries can prosecute hate speech without regard to what is being said elsewhere. Talk about Islam as a problem is common and legal in other countries. Here in Canada we&rsquo;ve recently had a couple of cases where prosecutions against so-called hate speech were dismissed. To a non-lawyer like me it wasn&rsquo;t clear what precedent was being set for allowable criticism of Islam either. I don&rsquo;t know what is allowable to say in Canada. The simple fact is people are getting news from around the world and shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to sort out their opinions depending on where they come from. This Swedish politician may have been following debates in other countries and he may have chosen his words assuming his followers are doing likewise.</p>

		<p>Sweden is for Swedes.  How difficult is this to comprehend?  If you want to see your own people and culture survive, or if you don&rsquo;t want to see the Swedish bikini team in burkhas, you are called a racist.</p>
<p>Mr. Akesson is wrong, however.  The biggest threat to both Sweden and Europe is not the spread of Islam, but the replacement of Christian Europe with Marxist Europe.  The Islamics are but a sympton.  They spread with the aid of the Marxists.</p>

<p><b>&#8220;The biggest threat to both Sweden and Europe is not the spread of Islam, but the replacement of Christian Europe with Marxist Europe. The Islamics are but a symptom.&#8221;</b></p>

Islam and Marxism, both totalitarian but ideological opposites, are presently using each other against a common foe; but ultimately they are  mortal enemies who must destroy one or the other.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   Yes, it&rsquo;s idiotic;  but it&rsquo;s their convenient excuse for not having to face reality.</p>
<p><b>They&rsquo;re really, really need an example&hellip; Spain had its trains blown up. The US had its twin towers annihilated, etc.  All of them need more of the same before they can understand what any fool knows just by living from day to day. </b></p>
<p>  &mdash;   Sweden has  escaped that experience (thus far) by pandering to its Moslem immigrants.  Sweden&rsquo;s politicians have sold out their country and its people&rsquo;s future by buying some temporary peace.  </p>
<p>But the way things are going in heavily immigrant cities like Malmo and Gothenburg, that peace isn&rsquo;t going to last for long.  Within a generation there will be massive changes &hellip; and violence.  There already is, but it&rsquo;s played down. They won&rsquo;t be able to suppress it indefinitely.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p><b>Åkesson&rsquo;s article, published in Aftonbladet on Monday, has provoked a furious reaction following the Sweden Democrat chief&rsquo;s assertion that the spread of Islam represents the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatest external threat since World War II&rdquo;.</b></p>
<p>  &mdash;   I was not aware that Sweden, a neutral country which fact  was respected by all, was under any  &#8220;external threat&#8221; during WW II.  A threat from where?  From whom?</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;We are of the view that the article agitates against Muslims when it points at Islam as the greatest threat to Sweden,&rdquo; said Mariam Osman Sherifay, head of the organization and Social Democrat politician, to the TT news agency.</b></p>
<p>  &mdash;   Mariam Osman Sherifay   &mdash;  - hardly a neutral, disinterested person in this matter! (And there&rsquo;s a real Swedish name for you!)</p>
<p>  &mdash;   If someone wrote  an article claiming that communism (or capitalism) was harmful and a threat to the country, would that constitute  agitating for violence against communists  (or capitalists)?    Should it be banned? <br>
If you oppose the environmentalists (let&rsquo;s just say), are you a threat to them? Should you be banned?</p>
<p>  &mdash;   In the long run, should ALL critical speech or writing be banned  because someone might feel annoyed or offended?   Should ALL controversial speech and writing  be limited ultimately to discussing the weather or recipes?</p>
<p><b> &#8220;all we get once again are sweeping accusations portraying an ethnic group as a threat, all of which is based on facts that are dubious to say the very least.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>  &mdash;    Just what ethnic group are Moslems?   I might as well ask what ethnic group are Roman Catholics?  What ethnic group are Protestants? <br>
Racism?   What race is involved here? That has never been explained.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    Incidentally, I note too, that there is never any question that racism is outlawed. That assumption goes completely unchallenged.   The only remaining question is whether or not something is considered &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>
<p><b>Tempers have flared as the battle heats up for the conservative vote. &hellip;polls indicate  that the Sweden Democrats are closing in on the percentage necessary for representation in the Riksdag.</b></p>
<p>That means the opposition will do ANYTHING to prevent this from happening!  Anything. Same in Britain. Same in Holland and Belgium.  Despite all surface pretensions to a pompous display of morality, the fact is that European politics are ruthless and totally unprincipled.  Always have been. History shows us that they stop at NOTHING where access to power is concerned.</p>
<p>Power is an intoxicant. And European history, when read more than superficially, is nothing more than a chronicling of the crimes of the great and powerful to obtain and enhance their power. They drew no line, even at their own relatives. Not even their own parents or children!</p>
<p>Aside from a greater nervousness about public opinion today, because of television, literacy,  and the press, I don&rsquo;t see where anything has changed from past centuries.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   His viewpoint, I am sure, is that he is representing the whole human race, and that Swedes  (a tiny percentage of the whole) are relatively insignificant and unimportant and take a  minor place;  and that he should show no favor to his own kind.  In his view, it would be immoral to do so.   </p>
<p> That  universalist view, which passes for being enlightened,  is  not too far-removed from the attitudes of many of our own &#8220;representatives&#8221; in the US.   It is trendy.  It is the new globalism.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   A  pious pretense and sham, yes, as WE  can see it.  But not he and his ilk.  They can&rsquo;t.  I have no doubt at all that such obedient &#8220;brainwashees&#8221; [to coin a term]  are fiercely convinced of the morality of their position, and they will fanatically defend it.  I don&rsquo;t question their sincerity.  These robots have been brainwashed all their lives, and (just like good Moslems) sheltered from any contrary views that might challenge them.    We see that it&rsquo;s a sham;  but they don&rsquo;t. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Facts that are dubious?  No, they&rsquo;re allegations at most.<br>
I failed to catch this the first time around.  If the &#8220;facts&#8221; are dubious, then they are not FACTS!   But if they are facts, then they are beyond dispute.</p>
<p>This illustrates the nonsense and double-talk of their arguments, which they can&rsquo;t even phrase intelligibly.<br>
==================<br>
In spite of everything and all the distressing news, Sweden is not finished yet. Don&rsquo;t give up on it.   Denmark, in my observation, is further down the road  (though it&rsquo;s lately showing signs of resistance).   The Swedes  are  still a healthy and wholesome people,  given to vigorous outdoor sports of every sort.  You see joggers, skaters, bicyclists everywhere.  All going <i> f-a-s-t.  </i> Water skiers in the fjords. Even people climbing the sides of buildings and cliffs! (It&rsquo;s a sport.)  I saw no drunks, junkies, massage parlours, prostitutes   &mdash;   which you see in every German city.  Not there.  You can&rsquo;t even get drunk on Swedish beer (it&rsquo;s too weak).   There is  far more decadence and rot in Copenhagen than in Stockholm.   </p>
<p>I spent half the summer in Sweden, and am going back for December as well.  Admittedly, I only saw the country through the eyes of a visitor.  I don&rsquo;t know what people say among themselves, in private.  Naturally, they&rsquo;re cautious with a foreigner; and I don&rsquo;t speak Swedish.  (They all seem to speak perfect English, btw.)  I did see a disturbing amount of dusky immigrants and miscegenation   &mdash;   though  still not so much as in Copenhagen.  Just like here: you see the usual black man/white woman; and  the white man/Asian woman.    The latter are usually married, with children.  The former are not.  And you also see the sad, lone white woman with a mulatto child.</p>
<p>I (personally) encountered no problems with censorship, even on the Internet  (which I have encountered in France and Germany, where some sites are blocked); everything was available,  but good sense dictates caution.  There was construction and prosperity everywhere.  The standard of living is very high. Prices are exhorbitant by  American standards, but worse in Denmark and Norway. (Oslo is now the world&rsquo;s most expensive city.)  Some people on the Internet say that Sweden is kaput,  gone, finished.  I disagree!   It may be down, but it&rsquo;s not out.  Despite its problems, there&rsquo;s a lot of life left in it yet.  I wish them well.</p>

		<p>Why aren&rsquo;t those advocating racist colonialism against the Swedish people and nation being investigated by the Chancellor of Justice?   Sweden has had an explosion of clearly racist attacks by these Muslims and other immigrants,  including muggings and rape,  against Swedish natives,  why isn&rsquo;t silence from the leftist party leaders about this little street Holocaust considered to be a form of agitation against an ethnic group?  For that matter, why isn&rsquo;t it considered to be a war crime?   </p>

		<p>That remark about valuing a Swedish life more than that of a foreigner&rsquo;s needs to be further explored.<br>
The only, logical, honest and rational corollary to that remark is to establish such a thing as a &#8216;universal income&rsquo; in which the entire World&rsquo;s disposable annual wealth increment is divide exactly equally between all the World&rsquo;s 6 billion plus population.<br>
 - Then and only then can the protagonist actually speak with some moral authority.Although the Kingdom of Sweden hasn&rsquo;t yet decided to implement such a policy, the protagonists of such an argument are free to pursue the policy by donating the surplus of their &#8216;world dividend&rsquo; to a 3rd World charity of their choice.<br>
Remarkably none choose to do so.</p>

		<p>Though many Amren Conservative readers might think all Swedes have been hopeless, idiot, PC Leftists, race mixers since, well, since they converted to Judeo Christianity from Odinism - the truth is that Sweden has had a very strong nationalist movement amongst Swedish youth for some time - they have had many excellent leaders.</p>
<p>One of my favorite is Swedish Nationalist singer Saga - she is such a beautiful, brave talented gal and I think she will meet Amren&rsquo;s standards for the right kind of White Nationalism.</p>
<p>Please check out her videos on Youtube - I love her.</p>
