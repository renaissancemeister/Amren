			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Douglas, Pulse Wrestling, October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While most outlets of mainstream entertainment have pushed the limits of reality in their quest to toe the politically correct line (if television is any indication, one in three doctors are black) the WWE [World Wrestling Entertainment] has remained unapologetically racist. It is racist not because Chairman Vince McMahon secretly attends Klan meetings under the cloak of night  &mdash;  though the country clubs he is sure to frequent are not far off  &mdash;  but rather, because his staff is lazy and lacks any semblance of creativity or imagination. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Wrestling harkens to simpler times when women were big breasted, docile, with a nary a thought in their heads; men were ripped, glistening and vengeful; and coloreds were little more than a collection of the broadest available stereotypes. Perhaps this simplistic appeal to our base desires is what makes wrestling so alluring, drawing millions of viewers each week despite its meager offerings. {snip} The downside to such a formulaic, reductionist approach is that certain demographics are bound to be stung by their unfair, simple portrayal.</p>
<p>Which is why, several weeks ago during Smackdown, I was not surprised that my friends were filled with a white hot rage when they laid their eyes upon Cryme Tyme. I admitted Cryme Tyme were the most embarrassing black act to ever grace a WWE ring, including Mark Henry banging an 80-year-old woman, yet I didn&rsquo;t share their anger. Granted, only a wrestling show could escape criticism at scripting two black men to steal, speak in the incomprehensible gibberish that passes as English to the ignorant black set, and hold impromptu booty contests with (surprise surprise) the other ethnic girls on the roster. {snip}</p>
<p>Kofi Kingston fares little better. Though he is thin (comparatively) on stereotype Kingston (a Ghanian billed from Jamaica as Creative thinks the viewers too stupid to connect a black man from any other country) is also accepted by the audience, though on different terms. Kofi is wide-eyed, vacant, all claps, shuck and smiles; for if there is one thing we know, once a black man stops smiling he is but mere moments from bludgeoning and raping the nearest white woman. His smile assures us he is one of the safe &#8220;ones&#8221;; safe meaning a Negro you&rsquo;d set a place for on Thanksgiving but start polishing the .45 if he made eyes at your sister. Yes, it&rsquo;s a borderline racist gimmick but I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to break out the camo gear and bowie knife each time he shambles down to the ring.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As long as blacks are willing to send the entire race down the river for a few scraps of money and attention, I can&rsquo;t get angry at the companies for exploiting them. Yes, there is something horribly wrong with black culture, and it is in poor taste to use it for profit, but should we black people not hold our own to the same standard? Why is it honorable for 50 Cent (Gucci pellet guns tucked beneath his Fendi bulletproof vest) to brag, from the confines of his Massachusetts mansion of course, about drugs sold and souls hastened into the afterlife, but once a Disk Jockey besmirches a woman&rsquo;s basketball team, the gates of hell must open and swallow him whole? Why can blacks tap their foot to the latest rap video, champagne cascading down the ass crack of a well-built gutter rat, $60,000 chains and $100,000 watches winking under the stage lights (while a number of fellow black people toil like rats in the inner city) but are blind with rage the moment the puppeteer of this masquerade is revealed?</p>
<p>As a black man, I am not entitled to outrage each time Mami (Mama Benjamin) and Uncle Tom (Virgil, Kofi) are paraded before me, but as a wrestling fan I sure as s*** am. I&rsquo;ve had enough of the one-dimensional characters, scripted distractedly by a Hollywood hack while his Blackberry eagerly awaits a callback from According to Jim. I refuse to watch Shad and JTG saunter around the ring with a thug act that wouldn&rsquo;t pass muster in Killa Season or Baller Blockin&rsquo;, not because they are disgraceful (which they are) but because I have no reason to care whether they win, lose or die. Why should I? One reason Stone Cold Steve Austin succeeded was because he was a three-dimensional character. {snip} Yet when creative is faced with creating a black character, they fall far short, settling on oversexed, violent, semi-retarded thieves.</p>
<p>No, Vince McMahon doesn&rsquo;t hate black people. He&rsquo;s just too lazy to show any different.<br>

		<p> I would like to see a better plot in wrestling myself and a move away from the disgusting pervo show wrestling has become. A black well spoken face would be a change of pace at least.<br>
 The audiences for wrestling are mostly lower middle class but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are ignorant rednecks. This writer is correct in that the scripts offered are infantile but that&rsquo;s true for all wrestlers.</p>

		<p>Wrestling had its flagship Black champion in The Rock (aka Duane Johnson).  Unfortunately, he got affirmative-actioned into Hollywood.  The reason there are so few interesting black wrestlers is that the best of the black athletes and performers end up in professional sports or Hollywood.  Men like Jean-Paul Levesque (Triple H), Steve Austin, John Cena, et cetera flock to wrestling because they are denied opportunities in acting and professional sports.  Vince McMahon isn&rsquo;t stupid - if there were blacks who could cut a promo or perform a match like The Rock, he&rsquo;d put them front and center.  Instead, he has to face the reality that the most athletically and theatrically gifted men who become pro wrestlers are white.  Gimmicks like &#8220;Cryme Time&#8221;, and many other racially-themed personae before it, are the last resort of a promotion trying to provide a serviceable identity to a performer who completely lacks the intelligence and charisma to forge an identity of his own.</p>

		<p>Say what you will about it as an artform, but pro wrestling has basically been the only primetime tv show in recent history to portray whites as strong.</p>
<p>For that, I salute it and Vince McMahon.</p>

		<p>If it upsets you don&rsquo;t watch it nor report it for some sports newspaper/sheet.  I stopped watching &#8220;professional wrestling&#8221; in the early 1960s.  Ho hum why cry about it?</p>

		<p>This was supposed to be a criticism of black rappers, but it had so many veiled attacks against whites and white society that it came across as the disingenuous piece that it is. However, at least the author admitted how badly television is stretching the bounds of reality in portraying one in three doctors as black. </p>
<p>I laughed out loud when I read that. I knew television propaganda was bad, but I underestimated just how far it had gone. I would love to see a study comparing with reality the percentage on television of black doctors, lawyers, scientists, computer programmers, etc..</p>

		<p>Like with everything else concerning black status relative to whites, they seem to overlook all of the other races and nationalities of mankind that are not represented.  This never seems to trouble them or cloud their way of thinking.</p>

		<p>Good point, Conan.   If anyone is hungry to see the strength of white athletes on display, I suggest taking a look at boxing.   White fighters have been dominating boxing, holding 17 of 20 champion belts from middleweight to heavyweight at the beginning of the year.  </p>
<p>There is a fine article on the subject on www.castefootball.us </p>

		<p>I dispute this. Pro wrestling is on the level and not faked! (It is the World Series and the Superbowl that are fakes, but that is another thread.)  Blacks can&rsquo;t win at prowrestling because they are no good. Look at the way whites are dominating the boxing chanpionships nowadays.</p>

		<p>I believe a higher percentage of Bantus believe pro wrestling is genuine, than whites. A friend of mine who worked for the phone company told me of a Bantu co-worker who refused to watch pro wrestling, because he felt it was &#8220;too violent&#8221;. My friend told this Bantu that pro wrestling was scripted, but he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.</p>
<p>Vince McMahon has always created controversy with storylines that follow the events of the day. No one has ever accused him of being politically corret.</p>
<p>During Gulf War I, McMahon stoked hatred of Iraqis by promoting a &#8220;feud&#8221; between Sgt. Slaughter and the Iron Shiekh.</p>
<p>During the AIDS epidemic of the 1980&rsquo;s, when AIDS burst onto the national scene, McMahon had Adrian Adonis prance around and act gaylike - during a time when there was backlash against gays, for being responsible for the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Now, Bantus who follow pro wrestling, are upset with McMahon because they feel he is &#8220;racist&#8221; by having Bantu wrestlers follow a gangsta personna, which they feel is stereotypical. Heck, who do they think provided McMahon with food and fuel in the first place? It was MTV, BET, pro football, African genocidal conflicts and life in the black ghetto in American big cities, among others.</p>
<p>Remember McMahon&rsquo;s disastrous XFL venture, a few years ago? Most of the players on the teams were Bantus, just like in the NFL. I knew that the XFL didn&rsquo;t have a prayer at succeeding, and that the Bantu players were just using it as an audition to employment in the NFL. They may consider McMahon to be a racist nowadays, but, boy, did they flock to his XFL organization.</p>
<p>Bantus are upset, not only at the &#8220;stereotypes&#8221;, as they consider it, but the fact that these are being brought out into the open, away from the ghetto areas, where Mainstream America can view it. Just like the recording of that high school student beaten in Chicago - Bantus were upset that the whole world saw that tape. They want the non-Bantu peoples of the world to pretend we all live in a multicultural &#8220;rainbow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Guess what, that dog don&rsquo;t hunt.  </p>

You are watching wrestling with your friends and having fun screaming at the T.V. then have this epiphiney&hellip;hey the blacks do not get good scripts&hellip;..THEN FRET OVER IT!!!</p>
<p>Were yu to spend half the energy looking at the good whites do for all other races maybe you could be proud.<br>
The soup lines are staffed mostly by whites. Almost all real charities are founded funded and staffed by whites. Etc. etc etc,,, get a life. </p>

<p>You are wrong about the fued, Sgt. Slaughter and the Iron Sheik fueded in the early 80&rsquo;s. By Gulf War I Sgt. Slaughter had become a traitor to America and sided with the Iron Shiek and Col. Mustafa to take on Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior. I remember watching the match on PPV. </p>

		<p>Say what you want about Vince McMahon, but most of his business endeavors end up making a lot of money. Sure, the XFL didn&rsquo;t have enough oomph or media pull, and a bodybuilding organization he started was sabotaged by a more established organization and their cronies / kin in the MSM, but overall McMahon knows how to pull a crowd and how to run a business. Maybe blacks need their own version of McMahon. Oh, wait a minute&hellip;</p>
<p>Another side of this attack is the fact that a lot of people in the MSM hate McMahon for his success - they would love to steal his business from him. That&rsquo;s no rumor, that&rsquo;s fact. </p>
