			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William J. Bratton, Los Angeles Times, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Keeping America&rsquo;s neighborhoods safe requires our police forces to have the trust and help of everyone in our communities. My nearly 40 years in law enforcement, and my experience as police commissioner in Boston and New York City and as chief in Los Angeles, have taught me this.</p>
<p>Yet every day our effectiveness is diminished because immigrants living and working in our communities are afraid to have any contact with the police. A person reporting a crime should never fear being deported, but such fears are real and palpable for many of our immigrant neighbors.</p>
<p>This fear is not unfounded. Earlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that 11 more locations across the United States have agreed to participate in a controversial law enforcement program known as 287(g). The program gives local law enforcement agencies the powers of federal immigration agents by entering into agreements with Homeland Security&rsquo;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Although many local agencies have declined to participate in 287(g), 67 state and local law enforcement agencies are working with ICE, acting as immigration agents.</p>
<p>Some in Los Angeles have asked why the LAPD doesn&rsquo;t participate. My officers can&rsquo;t prevent or solve crimes if victims or witnesses are unwilling to talk to us because of the fear of being deported. That basic fact led to the implementation almost 30 years ago of the LAPD&rsquo;s policy on immigrants, which has come to be known as Special Order 40. The order prohibits LAPD officers from initiating contact with someone solely to determine whether they are in the country legally. The philosophy that underlies that policy is simple: Criminals are the biggest benefactors when immigrants fear the police. We can&rsquo;t solve crimes that aren&rsquo;t reported because the victims are afraid to come forward to the police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Police Foundation published a report in April titled &#8220;The Role of Local Police: Striking a Balance Between Immigration Enforcement and Civil Liberties.&#8221; The report confirms that when local police enforce immigration laws, it undermines their core public safety mission, diverts scarce resources, increases their exposure to liability and litigation, and exacerbates fear in communities that are already distrustful of police.</p>
<p>The report concluded that to optimize public safety, the federal government must enact comprehensive immigration reform. {snip}</p>
<p>Working with victims and witnesses of crimes closes cases faster and protects all of our families by getting criminals off the street. We must pass immigration reform and bring our neighbors out of the shadows so they get the police service they need and deserve. When officers can speak freely with victims and witnesses, it goes a long way toward making every American neighborhood much safer.</p>
<p>William J. Bratton is chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. The Police Foundation&rsquo;s report is available online at https://www.policefoundation.<br>

		<p>I live a few miles outside of L.A. in a community that used to be five star quality many years ago. I can tell you this with complete honesty, Bratton has endangered the citizenry in L.A. and all surrounding areas. He once told a radio caller, that, &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t like the L.A. police&rsquo;s policies, leave the state.&#8221; NOW HE&rsquo;S LEAVING THE STATE. Here is what his legacy under Villaraigosa&rsquo;s leadership means for Los Angeles  &mdash;  Gangs control all surrounding areas of L.A. and the police&rsquo;s hands are tied to do anything about it. Thank you Chief Bratton for your &#8220;service&#8221;.</p>

What the heck does he mean about: &#8220;Our immigrant neighbors&#8221;???</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not immigrants!  They&rsquo;re illegal aliens, gate-crashers,  invaders who should not be here.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re here <i>against the LAW;</i> and it&rsquo;s his job to uphold the law!  Does he need to be reminded him of that?  What has he been collecting his salary for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough when you have this teary-eyed kind of sob story from some lefty young jouralism student &hellip;  but from the Police Chief of one of our major cities?   It&rsquo;s sickening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton   &mdash;   the Big Apple&rsquo;s former top cop   &mdash;   is stepping down after seven years and returning to New York to take a big-bucks job with a newly formed private-security firm.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the LAPD Chief and next in NYC, Billy Boy NEVER lives in the neighborhoods infested with the invaders. Even when he has to go slumming in the barrios, he has plenty of armed assistants keeping an eye on the locals.</p>
<p>Yet another limousine liberal hypocrite.</p>

		<p>Typical treason from a member of the Revolting Elite.   Bratton&rsquo;s career benefits from supporting the white-hating policies of the dominant elite, he doesn&rsquo;t care what it does to the nation or whether members of the lower classes get raped, robbed, murdered, or ethnically cleansed.   None of that touches the archipelago of wealth that is his real homeland.    </p>

<p>All true. As a resident of Los Angeles, it&rsquo;s clear that Bratton, who has been nothing but a political hack from day 1 of his &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; career was put in place here to make sure (among other things) that the elite&rsquo;s program of stuffing the city with as many ignorant, violent, diseased ridden illegals from Latin America would not be interrupted. He was here to ensure that the black and brown criminal element would not be too restricted in their program of purging whites from the area. Under his tenure false statistics were thrown to the public left and right, with the cover finally being blown a few months ago when it was discovered <i>all crimes</i> were being underreported and that crime was it highest levels ever, despite a lower black population overall. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that with Bratton leaving, the media has kicked into high gear on another anti-white campaign. The three top insiders (from within the dept as opposed to outsiders like Bratton) from the LAPD are white males. The media has gone mad, stating that this is the worst thing that could happen to this city, why isn&rsquo;t a black, latino, female, etc one of the top prospects and so on. It will be interesting to see if the powers that be go on a search for the great non-white candidate to become chief of a dept that went from the best in the country to a 2nd rate organization, filled with brown and black officers on the take, former gangbangers and worse. </p>

<p>Chief Bratton is simply a disgusting hack and a shill for those who will pay his retirement, plus any under the table benefits he gets for forcing peace officers to turn a blind eye to a veritable DELUGE of crime-every crime from simply breaking into the country illegally, to identity fraud, to rape, murder, and extremely violent organized crime- as in the vicious, vile MS 13 gang.<br>
Bratton is a national disgrace and is himself abbetting crime on a massive scale . Besides deserving everybody&rsquo;s loud scorn and renunciation, he is due to be arrested fo being a criminal himself. How else would you treat a top law enforcement official who refuses to obey the law, at the expense of countless lives, and at the cost of the security and well being of all? <br>
Someone indict this guy .</p>

I wouldn&rsquo;t even say that much.  He&rsquo;s a groveling SERVANT to the Hostile Elites who rule us.   Well paid, yes.  And privileged far beyond the rest of us    &mdash;  -  in return for his good service to them.  </p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s their servant nonetheless. Not one of them (though he&rsquo;d like to be).  He knows where his bread is buttered and who writes his paycheck.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly crying that Bratton is leaving our state.  He must&rsquo;ve got one heck of an offer from that international security firm!!  People like him are the ones who have put this bill before the Congress, and if it passes, there will be no such thing as an &#8220;illegal alien,&#8221; no such thing as a &#8220;border,&#8221; and U.S. citizenship will mean virtually nothing.</p>

<p>Exactly. Bratton now has a nice &#8220;consultant&#8221; job line up for himself AWAY FROM LA.</p>
<p>I have thought that some crime victim or victims in a class action law suit perhaps, need to go after these sanctuary cities and the top cops personally in civil court. If you could demonstrate that the cops arrested an illegal, did nothing to deport him, and later you were a victim of that same illegal, civil court suit could bankrupt the city and personally destroy those top cops. That would get their attention.</p>
