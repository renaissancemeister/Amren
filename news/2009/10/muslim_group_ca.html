<h1>Muslim Group Calls for Burka Ban in Canada</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Lewis, National Post (Toronto), October 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Canadian Muslim group is calling on Ottawa to ban the wearing of the burka in public, saying the argument that the right to wear it is protected by the charter&rsquo;s guarantee of freedom of religion is false.</p>
<p>&#8220;The burka has absolutely no place in Canada,&#8221; said Farzana Hassan, of the Muslim Canadian Congress. &#8220;In Canada we recognize the equality of men and women. We want to recognize gender equality as an absolute. The burka marginalizes women.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said many women who cover their face in public are being forced to by their husbands and family. As a result, she argued, these women are denied opportunities and cannot live freely as other women in this society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Koran exhorts Muslims toward modesty, which can be expressed in a number of different ways and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that you have to cover your face or you have to wear a virtual tent wherever you go. This is not a requirement of Islam or the Koran. We are saying this practice has become a political issue promoted by extremists and to counter this trend we are asking for a ban on the burka.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposal calls for the banning of &#8220;masks, niqabs and burkas.&#8221; A niqab covers the face but allows the eyes to be seen; a burka covers the entire body and the eyes are obscured by a mesh covering.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me that is a huge embarrassment,&#8221; said Hassan. &#8220;It brings the kind of criticism Muslims (unfairly) face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hassan said her group is bringing this up now because of an edict released this week in Egypt, by a top Muslim authority, calling for a ban on the burka.</p>
<p>Hassan said she is not asking for the banning of the hijab, which just covers the hair, but she would also like to see that custom vanish.</p>
<p>Professor Amir Hussain, who teaches theology at Loyola Marymount College in Los Angeles, but grew up in Toronto, said the fact that the burka is not in the Koran does not mean that it is not part of authentic religious practice and that many religions absorb cultural practices that eventually become sacred.</p>
<p>He said he does not believe there are enough women wearing the burka in Canada to call it a serious issue. But for those women who are being forced to wear it by family members, the best way to deal with it is to reach out to those women on an individual level.</p>
<p>He said any legal ban will infringe on fundamental democratic rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Turkey, a secular society, it is illegal to wear it. In Iran you&rsquo;ll be punished if you don&rsquo;t wear it. Either way imposing a belief on women.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past few years, the debate over what kind of religious dress should be allowed has been loud and intense.</p>
<p>In June, French President Nicolas Sarkozy went so far as to call a parliamentary commission to look at whether to ban the wearing of burkas and niqabs in public. In France, religious headgear of any faith has already been banned in public schools.</p>
<p>Also in June, the Michigan Supreme Court amended its rules of evidence to give trial judges discretion over whether a woman can be fully veiled when testifying or when bringing accusations. The new rule did not mention Muslims but it will clearly affect Muslims.</p>
<p>Last year an Ontario judge said religious beliefs did not give a woman the right to wear a veil while testifying against her alleged rapist. The decision is now before the Ontario Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>In 2007, a Quebec election official created controversy when he said veiled Muslim women would have to take off their veil if they wanted to vote.</p>
<p>Wahida Valiante, chair of the Canadian Islamic Congress, said the right to wear a burka is absolutely covered by the charter and no one can dictate what constitutes proper religious practice.</p>
<p>But she said by constantly bringing up a &#8220;miniscule&#8221; issue, that, too, skews society&rsquo;s impression of Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone ever finds this to be a huge problem I&rsquo;d be the first one to participate in that discourse. There&rsquo;s freedom of choice. Women can take their bra off and we don&rsquo;t have any laws against that. So in that context a woman can choose to cover their face in this country.&#8221;<br>

		<p> The Muslims can believe if they want to that these various tent-like garbs prescribed for &#8220;their&#8221; women are ordered by the Koran, or part of custom that has become religious, or whatever they want to believe.</p>
<p> But the fact remains that wearing such garb in a 21st Century society brands the wearers as relics of the Islamic Middle Ages, walking examples of what most of the world used to be, but has left behind. It makes it impossible for women to participate freely in that society.</p>
<p> And, I suspect, that is the real reason for the burka, etc., anyway. Muslim men must be desperately, DESPERATELY afraid that if &#8220;their&#8221; woman are able to walk about freely, and be seen in normal Western clothing by &#8220;infidel&#8221; men, their whole patriarchal, male-dominated society will come crashing down. I&rsquo;d hate to think that I was that unsure of my own manhood.</p>

Great comment and as I see it among orthodox Islamist who need to be challenged about their own male insecurities. By the way face covering was an old Persian/ Zorastrian social custom practised by upper class women so peasents couldn&rsquo;t lay eyes on them also protected them from becomming dark like the commoners, search it friends.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten some pretty filthy looks from Muslim women wearing headscarves. They&rsquo;ve been brainwashed into thinking that although they are supposedly inferior to man and must be treated as such, they have this incredible power to drive men mad simply by exposing their hair (and sometimes faces) in public. That&rsquo;s how you keep a group of people down - you can&rsquo;t take everything away from them; rather, you have to fool them into thinking that they do have something supposedly powerful that the other dominant group lacks.</p>
<p>So they come here and see western white men such as myself interacting with &#8216;topless&rsquo; women and managing to keep ourselves under control. This bursts the Muslim women&rsquo;s bubble big-time. They realize that they don&rsquo;t have this incredible power after all. Even typecasting western men as &#8216;not really men&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t wash, they must belatedly recognize. So they&rsquo;re bitter - bitter at us, rather than at Muslim men and their misogynistic culture and religion.</p>

<p>Actually, Muslims have no place in Canada.  Canada should end immigration, not issue totalitarian laws about what people should wear.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The burqua has absolutely no place in Canada&#8221;, says Farzana Hassan.  True, but nobody named Farzana Hassan has any business volunteering an opinion on any Western nation&rsquo;s internal affairs.  </p>

		<p>Interesting. So a group of Muslim women are asking a Western Government to ban a traditional Islamic (whether religious or not it is traditional) covering that they say is forced on them by men&hellip; ie the patriarchy? This way they get to not wear the offending item and remain blame free at the same time.</p>
<p>Thats a very Western feministic tactic they are using.</p>
<p>I have been wondering for years what will happen when Western feminism meets Islamic doctrine head on and it looks like it is really starting.</p>
<p>The white race could only be brought to this state by it&rsquo;s own turning on itself. Now lets see if that same cancer called feminism will be enough to lay waste to Islam.</p>
<p>My bet is on the feminist.</p>

		<p>You can dress &#8220;modestly&#8221;, without being covered from head to toe in some kind of ridiculous garb. No, requiring people to dress as a bunch of knuckleheaded muslim males decide is &#8220;appropriate&#8221; is nothing more then a power play.</p>

		<p>To Matt:</p>
<p>Good post, paisan. I think that Muslim women are a turnoff, personally; but, because of the image that some in the West have, of the Muslim belly dancer or harem concubine, there is this fascination about the (supposed) &#8220;allure&#8221; of the Middle East Arab woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Middle East Muslim women though. Black women often place ads in the Personals, describing themselves as &#8220;Nubian goddesses&#8221;, and the like.</p>
<p>Would you really want to hang out with a woman who won&rsquo;t eat a pork chop or drink beer?</p>

		<p>Clash of civilisations.Muslims are primitive people who have not advanced themselves as we have in the West.They want all the benefits of Western civilisation which is why they ride the immigration super highway.Yet they hate the white people and if we don&rsquo;t put a stop to this we may be eradicated.</p>

		<p>The most important point in not whether Burqas should be allowed in Canada or not but what these Muslims are doing in Canada in the first place. They should not have been in Canada in the first place.</p>

		<p>A serious theological discussion with Muslims is almost impossible, it seems. The main problems is the overtly political nature of the beast, which, unnervingly enough, hasn&rsquo;t changed since it began 1300 years ago: same concepts, same &#8220;proselytizing&#8221; technique, same insistence on inerrancy, same subjugation of women.<br>
It is hard to believe, but in the 21st century the civilized world now has the unenviable task of trying to manage a deteriorating environment, a chaotic financial system, a demographic problem, and to top it all a 1.57 billion-strong outpatient mental health crisis unit.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think they should ban them as it gives the sheeple an indicator of just how &#8220;enriched&#8221; their community is becoming and just might awaken them from their torpor.</p>

		<p>We are laughing at them in a way but the future belongs to them, their descendants will inherit a muslim Canada and Europe while our history will be remembered by them.</p>
<p>We lost our purpose of existing, our will to fight.<br>
