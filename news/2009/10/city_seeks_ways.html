<p>&#8220;Parks for All New Yorkers: Immigrants, Culture and New York City Parks,&#8221; a new report [pdf] issued on Wednesday by New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit advocacy group, offers new ideas for adapting parks to immigrant communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To accommodate the increased demand for fields, the parks department plans to install lighting on 25 fields so the hours can be extended into the night.</p>
<p>And the department is translating many signs into Spanish, Korean, Italian, Chinese, Russian and Haitian Creole. {snip}</p>
<p>Although the report compliments the ambitions laid out in the language-access plan, it notes that the parks department might not have the financial resources to implement the plan at a time of government cutbacks. {snip}</p>
<p>And in a topic close to City Room&rsquo;s heart, the report also pushes the parks department to seek out more diverse food vendors for parks; ethnic food sellers make up only a small portion of permitted vendors in parks across the city.</p>

		<p>Well, just like the golf courses in New York, which Mayor Bloomberg said would suffer if illegal aliens are deported, we can use his same reasoning for New York&rsquo;s parks. The &#8220;hispanic&#8221; community would best be served by hiring illegal aliens to take care of the parks. Well, considering Mayor Mikes attitude on the laziness of Americans, they probably already work in the parks.</p>

<p>If they do this, I just hope the lighting controls are automated through a central control. We were excited when our local park installed lights on the baseball field for night games&hellip;.until the diamond was torn to pieces by midnight pickup soccer games. </p>
<p>Field misuse isn&rsquo;t usually a problem during the day because they are permitted. But unless the lights can be locked off, be prepared for open season during the late hours, after most people are home in bed, resting up for work the next day.</p>

		<p>Might I suggest, that to make the parks more &#8220;adaptable&#8221; to immigrants, that the parks be stocked with plenty of chickens, pigs, dogs and cats as a ready food source for said &#8220;immigrnts&#8221; We can of course, leave out the pigs to accomodate our friendly muslims if needed or they &#8220;peacefully protest&#8221; the presence of pigs. I am anxious to see the results of the muslims in England today and if the &#8220;march&#8221; happens and if it is peaceful!! NFW!</p>

		<p>Any White New Yorker cries when he sees how immigrants and blacks trash the parks they pay taxes for.  No trash makes it into the provided trashcans instead plastic, chicken wings, soda and beer cans, and dirty diapers litter the grass.</p>

Naw, Skip, you got it wrong&hellip;muslims consider dogs unclean, and will object to the Asians eating them. And of course, with the whole world here, someone will violently object to something eaten or otherwise enjoyed by some other society. Like  fundamentalist Muslims, snd their well known scorn for homosexuals and women&rsquo;s rights&hellip;oops, American Liberals, you lose!. Then there&rsquo;s American Liberals, who are all about kindness to animals, and who won&rsquo;t appreciate Hatian chicken slaughter, or Carribbean Horse munching. Sorry Carribbeans, you Lose!<br>
Hmm, in the utopia of multiculturalism, EVERYBODY LOSES!<br>
So you can see how it&rsquo;s all workin&rsquo; out fine.</p>

		<p>Another thought on the park thing! I am surprised we haven&rsquo;t heard of Somali or some other protected species squatting in our National forests where the Park Rangers (of which my sister is one) dare not make a career ending decision to attempt any removal of said &#8220;immigrants&#8221;</p>

		<p>How about adapting the immigrants to the parks for a change? This sounds like going into a college class that one didn&rsquo;t pay for and asking the students who did pay and the professor to change the class so the nonpaying immigrants will feel more at ease with the changed subject matter, taught in a changed manner, by a changed professor, so people who paid for the original class can receive the benefit of not learning what they paid for.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a former New Yorker who fled the city in the late 1980&rsquo;s. My  German grandmother had a very apt phrase for people divorced<br>
from reality like New York City liberals.  Such people, she said, reside in Cloud-Cuckoo Land.  From still keeeping tabs of<br>
my hometown from a distance, I have to agree. </p>
