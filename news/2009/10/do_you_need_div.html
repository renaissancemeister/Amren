<h1>Do You Need Diversity Training?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lizz Carroll, DiversityInc., October 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Are you unwittingly offending people in your office? Do you say things that cause others to wince or lose interest in having a collaborative relationship with you? You may be in need of good diversity training. DiversityInc put together a list of signs to show where you might be making cultural missteps.</p>
<p>To understand what effective diversity training is  &mdash;  and how to measure its results  &mdash;  visit www.DiversityIncBestPractices.com/training.</p>
<p>1. Race/Ethnicity</p>
<p>How do you interact with people from different races and ethnicities in the office? Have you ever found yourself complimenting a Black person on her ability to articulate well? Did you tell a Latino coworker that you were surprised he didn&rsquo;t have an accent? Do you think an Asian-American coworker is in an accounting position because &#8220;they&rsquo;re all skilled at math&#8221;? Have you ever said &#8220;you people&#8221; when referring to members of a different race and ethnicity?</p>
<p>When Linda Akutagawa, senior vice president of resource and business development at Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics (LEAP), hears negative terms like these in a professional space, she feels it undermines the overall strength of a company. &#8220;When you start to hear somebody say &#8216;people of your culture&rsquo; or &#8216;you people,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a whole &#8216;us-versus-them&rsquo; [mentality]. It sends a bad message of &#8216;It&rsquo;s not all about us, it&rsquo;s me, and then there&rsquo;s you guys.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>If a coworker openly displays religious symbols at his desk, wears garb that reflects faith or takes days off to observe religious holidays, this does not give you the right to probe more deeply about this very personal subject. Inappropriate questions can range from asking about dress, the strictness of their practice or questioning their accommodations (e.g., schedule changes).</p>

<p><b>1) You&rsquo;re so articulate</b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so articulate? Smart? Different? Yes, the speaker may intend a compliment, but what may be meant as praise instead comes across as being condescending. It implies the person being complimented is an exception to the rule and is exhibiting behavior atypical of others of his or her ethnic background.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>2) Is That Your Real Hair?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>3) &#8220;You&#8221; people</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>4) Do you eat a lot of (plug in the offending stereotype here)</b></p>
<p>Some stereotypes simply refuse to die. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with natural curiosity about the ethnic eating habits of some of your coworkers. The problem lies in focusing on stereotypical Black fare such as fried chicken, watermelon, etc. It reveals the speaker has a very limited and narrow perception of Black culture and cuisine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>5) Why are you so angry?</b></p>
<p>This one is more often directed at Black males, thanks in large part to the media, which often portrays Black men as being angry and/or criminals.</p>
<p><b>6) Why are you acting white?</b></p>
<p>Consider this a relative of &#8220;You&rsquo;re so articulate.&#8221; Why would exhibiting proper behavior, manners or dialect be categorized as acting white? If that&rsquo;s the case, what does it mean to act Black?</p>
<p><b>7) You don&rsquo;t sound Black over the phone.</b></p>
<p>What does Black sound like?</p>
<p><b>8) I don&rsquo;t think of you as Black.</b></p>
<p>{snip} Although the words and the sentiment are insulting, the person expressing them is (usually) not consciously trying to insult you. In their backward and ignorant way, they are actually trying to give you a compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>9) You graduated from where?</b></p>

<p><b><big>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Latino Executives</big></b></p>
<p><i>DiversityInc. staff, April 10, 2009</i></p>
<p><b>1. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get the promotion, you&rsquo;re Latina.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>This comment tells the Latino person that his or her ethnicity speaks louder than accomplishments; it&rsquo;s a classic affirmative-action stereotype that Latinos and Blacks deal with constantly. {snip}</p>
<p><b>2. &#8220;When did you arrive in this country?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>This comment assumes that everyone of Latin descent is a foreigner.</p>
<p><b>3. &#8220;Hola! Habla Ingles?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>This question is patronizing, especially when those three words are the only Spanish the speaker knows. Just speak English.</p>
<p><b>4. &#8220;Do you live with your parents?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that because someone is Latino, he doesn&rsquo;t live on his own. {snip}</p>
<p><b>5. &#8220;You&rsquo;re not like them.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;My first response is &#8216;How do <em>they</em> act?&rsquo; because I might say, &#8216;Well, I do act like that,&rsquo;&#8221; says Huerta.</p>
<p><b>6. &#8220;Can you show me your knife?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Raymond Arroyo, chief diversity officer at Aetna, No. 48 on The 2009 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity® list, was asked this question by a sales associate 20 years ago when he traveled to Toronto with three other Latino executives. At the time, mainstream news reports out of New York City told about Puerto Rican gangs wielding knifes. {snip}</p>
<p><b>7. &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t all you Latinos stop doing that?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>This statement assumes that because a person is Latino, he or she can influence an entire group. Latinos certainly are a varied group, from different countries of origin and with different race/ethnicities/cultural background. Lumping them all together is a common and silly assumption.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p><b>8. &#8220;You&rsquo;re not white.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Earlier in his career, Preuss was filling out forms as a new employee when a human-resources executive asked, &#8220;What are you?&#8221; Preuss, who is from Argentina and whose grandfather is from Germany, has a typical &#8220;white&#8221; look. Latinos can be of any race.</p>
<p><b>9. Butchering a Latino&rsquo;s last name.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s fault,&#8221; says Preuss, who has given up trying to correct people who mispronounce his last name. {snip}</p>
<p><b>10. &#8220;Do you speak Spanish?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s code for, &#8216;How Latino are you?&rsquo;&#8221; says Henry Hernandez, a management consultant and former vice president of diversity and inclusion at  American Express, No. 14 on the DiversityInc Top 50. {snip} But you can&rsquo;t make an assumption that because someone is Latino they&rsquo;re bilingual or that they&rsquo;re first- or second-generation [U.S. citizen]. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p><b><big>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Asian Coworkers</big></b></p>
<p><i>Kevin Canessa Jr., May 13, 2009</i></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Can&rsquo;t you &#8216;Americanize&rsquo; your name?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Not only did Brown suggest to an Asian American that &#8220;your citizens&#8221; change their names, she said it would be unfair for &#8220;us&#8221; to have to learn Chinese to better understand surnames. Michael Yaki, a political consultant and attorney in San Francisco, wrote on SFGate.com that Brown&rsquo;s comments were not only inappropriate, they were factually incorrect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last I checked, one of the most common Chinese surnames was still Wong. And Chin. And Lee. One syllable. I guess I&rsquo;m a bit confused as to how these names are &#8216;difficult&rsquo; for voter officials in Texas to figure out,&#8221; Yaki writes. {snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8220;If war broke out between your native country and America, which side would you support?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The late Iris Chang wrote several books on the Asian-American experience, including &#8220;The Chinese in America,&#8221; an honest chronicle of how Chinese people have been treated as outsiders in this country. Chang was fueled to write her bestselling book because a junior high-school classmate asked this very question: &#8220;Her question, innocently put, captures the crux of the problem facing the ethnic Chinese in America. Even though many are U.S. citizens whose families have been here for generations, while others are more recent immigrants who have devoted the best years of their lives to this country with citizenship as their goal, none can truly get past the distinction of race or entirely shake the perception of being seen as foreigners in their own land.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8220;You must be the IT person&#8221; or &#8220;You must be so good at math.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Implicit in that statement is that you&rsquo;re good at numbers and technology, so you&rsquo;re good behind the scenes,&#8221; explains Allan Mark, who is Chinese American and the America&rsquo;s director of diversity strategy and development, for Ernst &amp; Young (No. 3 on The 2009 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity® list).</p>
<p><b>&#8220;You&rsquo;re not exactly leadership material.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>For Asian-American executives who recently immigrated to the United States, the stereotype is two-fold: Not only are they viewed as not being leaders but their cultural norms are interpreted by U.S.-born executives as passive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b><big>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Muslim Coworkers</big></b></p>
<p><i>Gail Zoppo, August 25, 2009</i></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>1. &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t Muslims decide when Ramadan starts?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Since the Islamic calendar is lunar, Ramadan is determined by the sighting of the new moon, which varies from year to year. And like other faiths, there are interpretational differences in beliefs. &#8220;In America, there are two groups of Muslims: The first believes you can use scientific data to determine when a new moon can be sighted, and thus you can predetermine the month,&#8221; says Nadir Shirazi, creator of &#8220;The Ramadan Guide for the Workplace.&#8221; The second group, he says, &#8220;believes that you must sight the new crescent moon with the naked eye.&#8221; So the start/end dates of Ramadan, depending on the practices of Muslims in your workplace, may be different. This year, the holiday can start at sunset on the day proceeding Aug. 22 (or 23) and end Sept. 19 or 20 (or 21). Providing flexible hours and allowing floating holidays will permit employees of Islamic and other faiths to celebrate their holidays without using all their vacation time.</p>
<p><b>2. &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t you eat today?&#8221; </b></p>
<p>During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast during daytime hours, so scheduling office parties, fall festivals and luncheon meetings at that time &#8220;puts a Muslim coworker on the spot [and] can be embarrassing for both parties,&#8221; explains Shirazi.</p>
<p>Education and consideration are key. &#8220;The ideal thing is don&rsquo;t schedule office parties during these times,&#8221; says Niham Awad, founding member of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation&rsquo;s largest civil-liberties organization for American Muslims, based in Washington, D.C. {snip}</p>
<p><b>3. &#8220;But you don&rsquo;t look/dress like a Muslim.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>With an estimated 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, to think all look and dress similarly is a stereotype.. {snip} Conversely, asking a Muslim woman why she doesn&rsquo;t cover her body in a black niqab or drapery is equally inappropriate. {snip}</p>
<p><b>4. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know you were Arab.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>This is another culturally insensitive comment. The reason: Only about 20 percent of Muslims worldwide are Middle Eastern. &#8220;Muslims are Black. Muslims are white. Muslims are senators  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re in the White House,&#8221; says Chebli. (According to The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, three senior leaders in the U.S. government who are Muslim include: Dalia Mogahed, senior analyst and executive director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies; Ebrahim &#8220;Eboo&#8221; Patel, founder and executive director of Interfaith Youth Core [Mogahed and Patel are on the Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships]; and Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn.) According to the American Religious Identification Survey, 10 percent of Muslims are Latino, 15 percent are white, 27 percent are Black and 34 percent are Asian.</p>
<p><b>5. &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t you pray on your coffee break?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Depending on the times allowed for office breaks, this comment can violate religious rights. That&rsquo;s because &#8220;Muslim prayer must be done within specific time frames,&#8221; says Awad, adding that the second and third prayers are during business hours. What&rsquo;s more, Muslim prayer involves standing up and bowing on the floor, which can be awkward to perform in the workplace. It&rsquo;s also preferred that prayer be done in a group. Progressive companies will designate a private room or other facility for group prayer. On Fridays, when Muslims are obligated to pray in mosques and not in the office, &#8220;companies must give an extended lunch hour,&#8221; explains Awad. Companies such as Ford Motor Co., No. 28 in The 2009 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity®, are involving their interfaith-based employee-resource group to help give members space to share experiences and ideas of religious accommodation. &#8220;These are not only constitutional issues,&#8221; says Awad, &#8220;but when you have a friendly work environment, you will have better performing and more loyal employees.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you are a white male the best thing you can do is never say anything because if you open your mouth chances are that someone will be offended for some reason. The main reason they are offended is because you are still alive and they think your time in the sun is at an end. </p>

&#8220;Things you should never ask a white person&#8221;. Ooooops! They must of conveniently forgotton to include that one.</p>
<p>White liberal facillitators shoving this biased garbage down other whites throats burns me to no end. </p>
<p>The ONLY reason white-run businesses hold these workshops is to give themselves leverage in a court of law involving charges of race or gender bias. </p>
<p>White- run corporations smirk at these diversity workshops just like we do but profits come first so the end justifies the means. </p>
<p>Because of the corporate policies in place in regards to race, white men have nothing to gain from this but everything to lose.  They&rsquo;re trying to teach us normal whites how to walk on eggshells and we better not break any. </p>
<p>Diversity worshops are insulting to whites and thats why we resent them. </p>

		<p>Diversity training, black/white achievement gaps, charges of racism, non-white crime and violence, sensitivity training, teaching tolerance, on and on and on, are all irrefutable indicators that multiculturalist/multiracialist societies are failures, because tremendous amounts of time and money have to be spent in order to try to maintain a semblence of order.</p>
<p>All these weaknesses and problems are either absent or small by comparison in homogeneous societies.</p>
<p>Nothing speaks louder of the failure of &#8220;diverse&#8221; societies than the constant number of problems that have to be attended to on a daily basis or the entire society breaks up into angry mobs.</p>
<p>The ironic thing here is that even with all the above remedial action taking place, multiracial/multicultural societies still remain on the brink of disaster every day, 24/7.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a strength to me.  Maybe they should push for a slight change in the leftist slogan and amend it to say, &#8220;Diversity is a disaster.&#8221;</p>

After all, these lists were made for US to tip toe around these people, does it not cross their minds that we can be offended as well? I actually had a black coworker tell me what beautiful hair I had for a white girl. Can you imagine if I had said the same to her?</p>

Lizz Carroll covered all the pc rules on everyone but white folks. I guess it must be ok to do and say anything in front of whitey. Is that what you are saying by leaving white folks out Mizzzz Carroll?? That you have to tiptoe around on eggshells with everyone except whites??</p>

Heck, it&rsquo;s one reason why our Communist in Chief was/is lauded so. Whites are so taken aback when meeting a black that can read, write and articulate their thoughts in a coherent manner; it&rsquo;s akin to a scientist discovering a previously unknown species of animal.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t diversity grand?  You can offend people by saying just about anything!  You have to pretend not to know certain truths, such as the fact that most American blacks do have a recognizable accent, distinct not merely from the speech of whites but of second generation Asians (who have the same accent as white Americans).</p>
<p>I find it interesting that &#8220;progressive companies&#8221; should provide a private room for group Muslim prayer, when those same companies won&rsquo;t even put up a Christmas tree for fear that it will insult some non-Christian.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If war broke out between your native country and America, which side would you support?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It seems to me this is a fair question to ask of any immigrant.  It was certainly an issue among German, Italian, and Japanese Americans during World War II.  (Granted, it would help if my country wouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to get into wars with just about anybody.)</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Can&rsquo;t you &lsquo;Americanize&rsquo; your name?&rdquo;&#34;</i></p>
<p>Well, one Chinese man where I work has a name that is unpronounceable as it is spelled.  It has an insufficiency of vowels.  We joke about it.  He agrees, it&rsquo;s spelled very weird.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get the promotion, you&rsquo;re Latina.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I have no sympathy for people who belong to one of the privileged groups that receive affirmative action and are sensitive to remarks like this.  If you don&rsquo;t like such comments, work to get affirmative action abolished.<br>

They sell the whole package of &#8220;Mandatory Diversity consulting/training&#8221; to corporate America. We could refer to this as a slick, highly refined, and very adaptable (up to and including the creation of new classes of diversitoids that need &#8220;special handling&#8221; in the corporate world) version of the Jackson/Sharpton model. </p>
<p>https://www.diversityincbestpractices.com/bp/   </p>
<p>I found the following piece of opening copy from the above link particularly fascinating: </p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s the most effective type of diversity training? It depends on the corporate culture and issues such as geography and employee-base size.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that that nugget, ipso facto, is prima facie evidence that this outfit engages in preprogrammed discrimination based on geographical regionalism.</p>

Interacting with minorities is like swinging a stick around a hornets nest. The chances of saying something &#8216;offensive&rsquo; (or more likely something they can you to destroy your life) is too high to risk.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to avoid interactions when you can. Don&rsquo;t go out of your way to make friends (you can&rsquo;t, it will backfire). Be cordial when you&rsquo;re in close contact but keep a personal distance. Better to be accused of being rude than a racist.<br>

<p>Even so, these lists of rules are nonsense for an even better reason: Humans love - love - love to talk about themselves.  Give them half a chance to tell you everything you don&rsquo;t want to know about their group (or disability, or whatever), &amp; your co-workers will talk your ear off, questions or no.

<p>Sonia Sotomayor has a good German last name which she mispronounces and doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the intellectual curiosity to learn to pronounce correctly.  This name is probably the result of an effort of the Spanish government in the 1700&rsquo;s to get Roman Catholic Germans to immigrate to the Spanish colonies, as the British were trying to get Protestant Germans to immigrate to the British colonies.</p>
<p>The fact that Ms. Sotomayor doesn&rsquo;t know how to pronounce her name correctly does not mean that I have to mispronounce it.</p>

		<p>I read through all of the posts, many of them excellent, and found this one from sbuffalonative to be the more pertinent:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Your best bet is to avoid interactions when you can. Don&rsquo;t go out of your way to make friends (you can&rsquo;t, it will backfire). Be cordial when you&rsquo;re in close contact but keep a personal distance. Better to be accused of being rude than a racist&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The only change I would make to this statement would be to change  &#8216;cordial&rsquo; to &#8216;civil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was at a very large teachers&rsquo; meeting a few years back when an angry black took the podium and claimed that &#8220;someone [White] said &#8216;you people&rsquo;&#8221;  There were immediate, loud, angry cries of outrage with calls to &#8216;bring forth the racist!&rsquo;  There was pure, raw, fury that went on for a long time  &mdash;  I got a good dose of murderous black anger and I believe if a White had been identified as the utterer of these  words (whether he actually said them or not matters not), he would have been physically assaulted and definitely would have lost his job and pension before the day was out.</p>
<p>I heard comments such as:  &#8220;This society be racist!&#8221;, &#8220;They want to hold blacks down!&#8221;, &#8220;A black can&rsquo;t get a break!&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure if Whites weren&rsquo;t present it would have been &#8216;Kill Whitey!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I saw an intense hatred for Whites  &mdash;  even though most of them are barely literate, the product of AA mandates, quotas and extremely lowered standards  &mdash;  courtesy of White taxpayers and other White largesse. </p>
<p>The best course of action, as buffalonative writes, is to speak and interact with hyper-sensitive, hair-trigger blacks only when forced to do so.  One must keep in mind that the government favors them, not you and if you are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; you have little to no recourse.  </p>
<p>A lot of blacks, of course, want to hit the ghetto lottery and/or retire early with the winnings from a lawsuit and they are looking for any excuse possible to collect money.  I&rsquo;ve seen many of them go out on phony &#8216;stress leaves&rsquo; or school-related &#8216;accidents&rsquo; (like a slip and fall) then immediately claim they are permanently disabled and cannot work ever again.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a given with blatant empirical evidence all around us.  If multi-culturalism were so wonderful, its proponents would live in &#8216;multi-cultural&rsquo; cities and send their own children to &#8216;multi-cultural&rsquo; schools such as Richmond High, instead of living in cities such as Chappaqua NY that is 90% White or sending their precious children to the exclusive Sidwell Friends in DC.  These utter hypocrites mandate diversity for YOU but not for themselves [ just as they exempt themselves from government-rationed health care]. </p>
<p>The failure that is multi-culturalism will require more and more government force to keep in place. And the current administration seems to be stepping up its efforts to place refugees into White cities, move Section 8 housing into White neighborhoods and enforce more &#8216;diversity&rsquo; into the workplace via civil rights lawsuits sponsored by eric holder and czars that are accountable to no one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hearing disturbing calls for an internal army.  Obama&rsquo;s handlers fed the following into his tele-prompter during the campaign:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we&rsquo;ve set. We&rsquo;ve got to have a civilian national security force that&rsquo;s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded,&rdquo; Obama told a Colorado Springs audience earlier this month&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/nty5b6" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/nty5b6</a></p>
<p>What would be the purpose of an internal army?  To enforce diversity?  To restore &#8216;order&rsquo; when the economy collapses?  To make sure you hand over your wealth?  Or to create an authoritarian government/ police state lorded over by Hostile Elites answerable to no one? </p>
<p>The old Soviet bosses and Stalin himself would be proud.</p>
<p>Remember this quote from Jefferson (whom the educational system tells us is an &#8216;old dead White slaveholder&rsquo; and therefore irrelevant):</p>
<p>&#8220;The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.&#8221;</p>
<p>So which is it American?  Stalin or Jefferson?  You&rsquo;d better make a decision before it&rsquo;s too late. </p>

		<p>&#8220;If a coworker openly displays religious symbols at his desk, wears garb that reflects faith or takes days off to observe religious holidays, this does not give you the right to probe more deeply about this very personal subject.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I disagree!   To the contrary, if they are making a public display of it, as having a picture or religious symbols out on their desk, then they are inviting curiosity and are leaving themselves open to friendly questions.  Not all questions are necessarily hostile; and perhaps they want the questions. But if this is truly a deeply personal matter to them, then they should keep it private and not put it out before the public.  </p>
<p>This is like saying that if you don&rsquo;t want people to gape at you, then don&rsquo;t dye your hair green and walk down the street naked.  But if you do, then don&rsquo;t complain about the attention you get.</p>

		<p>So if blacks are superior to whites, as they claim, then why are they always whining about their &#8220;struggle&#8221;?  Why do they whine that getting through the day &#8220;being black&#8221; is hard enough?  If you are superior, then you don&rsquo;t complain and you don&rsquo;t whine about being oppressed.  </p>
