			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Revoir and Niall Firth, Daily Mail (London), October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Channel 4 is facing a race controversy after deciding to give a platform to scientists who claim that white people are more intelligent than those who are black.</p>
<p>A documentary, fronted by former BBC News correspondent Rageh Omaar, will interview professors who claim brain power is linked to racial grouping.</p>
<p>It will include claims that the most intelligent people in the world are North-East Asians from parts of China, Japan and North and South Korea.</p>
<p>The Australian Aborigines will be said to have the lowest average IQ.</p>
<p>The broadcaster has decided to air the comments, which will be abhorrent to many of its viewers, as part of a series of programmes about race and science, aimed at busting &#8216;science&rsquo;s last taboo&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Bosses at the channel claim the season will strongly challenge these opinions and &#8216;explode&rsquo; the myth that science can support ideas of racial superiority.</p>
<p>But the decision to air the issue at all could prove incendiary and is in danger of throwing the channel into another race row.</p>
<p>The broadcaster was inundated with complaints in 2007 after it aired the alleged racist bullying of Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother.</p>
<p>To promote the series, Channel 4 has altered photos of Baroness Thatcher, The Beatles, England&rsquo;s 1966 World Cup winning football team and U.S. President Barack Obama to change their racial appearances.</p>
<p>In Race and Intelligence: Science&rsquo;s Last Taboo, Omaar talks to academics who believe that aspects of the human brain are linked to race.</p>
<p>He interviews Richard Lynn, emeritus professor at the University of Ulster, who has amassed data which he believes shows there is a global league table of intelligence between the races.</p>
<p>He is seen claiming that &#8216;the top rate&rsquo; are North-East Asians who have an average IQ of 105, followed by North and Central Europeans with a score of 100.</p>
<p>He claims American Indians have an IQ of 87, and that sub-Saharan Africans &#8216;pretty well on either side of the equator&rsquo; have IQs of around 70. He says Aborigines have the lowest scores of around 65.</p>
<p>He says: &#8216;When sub-Saharan Africans come and live  &mdash;  and even several generations of them come to live  &mdash;  in European or North American countries, their IQs increase because of course their environment is improved, their schooling is better and their nutrition is better.</p>
<p>&#8216;But their IQs don&rsquo;t rise up to the same level as Europeans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>British-born J Philippe Rushton, a psychology professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, is also interviewed.</p>
<p>Professor Rushton claims the differences between black and white and East Asian brains is due to general intelligence.</p>
<p>He says black people have smaller-sized brains than white people and are not as intelligent as white people.</p>
<p>In the programme a range of academics line up to criticise the views of the two men.</p>
<p>Oona King, Channel 4&rsquo;s head of diversity, said the programme will show conclusively &#8216;that you cannot link race to IQ&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Miss King, a former Labour MP, added: &#8216;Even people who know the race agenda inside out will learn a lot from these programmes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She called for a &#8216;heated debate&rsquo; about race, saying: &#8216;This series will change the terms of the debate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr Watson sparked controversy in 2007 after claiming in a newspaper interview that black people were less intelligent.</p>
<p>His views prompted London&rsquo;s Science Museum to scrap a planned talk by him, saying the opinions went &#8216;beyond the point of acceptable debate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old American geneticist  &mdash;  who does not appear in the show  &mdash;  said he was &#8216;inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa&rsquo; because &#8216;all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours  &mdash;  whereas all the testing says not really&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added that he hoped that everyone was equal, but then alleged that &#8216;people who have to deal with black employees find this not true&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the interview he claimed genes responsible for creating differences in human intelligence could be found within a decade.</p>
<p>Dr Watson was hailed as achieving one of the greatest single scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he worked at Cambridge in the 1950s and 1960s, forming part of the team which discovered the structure of DNA.</p>
<p>He has been director of the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory on Long Island, in the U.S., a world leader in research into cancer and genetics, for 50 years.</p>
<p>Dr Watson has been at the heart of several scientific furores over the years.</p>
<p>He once reportedly said that a woman should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests could determine it would be homosexual.</p>
<p>He has suggested a link between skin colour and sex drive, proposing a theory that black people have higher libidos.</p>
<p>And he also claimed that beauty could be genetically manufactured, saying: &#8216;People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his book, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, he writes that &#8216;there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Oona King, Channel 4&rsquo;s head of diversity, said the programme shows conclusively &#8216;that you cannot link race to IQ&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Omaar also said in a clip of the show that views society found offensive &#8216;are not defeated by being ignored&rsquo;.</p>
<p>King was asked about Strictly host Bruce Forsyth&rsquo;s views that the nation should treat Anton Du Beke&rsquo;s &#8216;slip up&rsquo; of calling his dance partner Laila Rouass a &#8216;Paki&rsquo; more light-heartedly.</p>
<p>The diversity boss said that when Forsyth was growing up, people believed that race was an indicator of intelligence.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, King said: &#8216;What&rsquo;s surprising is how those views directly impact us today and how those views persist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &#8216;Sweeping racist views and opinions under the carpet will not make those views go away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked whether Forsyth had a place on television, she said: &#8216;I think of my white grandmother when I think of Bruce Forsyth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said her grandmother was a &#8216;very, very lovely woman&rsquo; who was upset about her family members being &#8216;half-caste&rsquo; and had to deal with her world being turned on its head.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;My view is that we need to open up the terms of the debate, not close it down. I think there&rsquo;s room for people questioning people&rsquo;s responses to the debate.</p>
<p>&#8216;The key for me is that when people say: &#8216;You don&rsquo;t have a sense of humour&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re not taking the context into account.</p>
<p>&#8216;The context for a black child being bullied day-in, day-out is entirely different from an off-the-cuff remark about &#8216;limeys&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>King also spoke of her own experiences as a child, when her &#8216;black, 6ft 2ins dad&rsquo; arrived to pick her up from primary school in front of four white girls.</p>
<p>&#8216;The four of them burst into tears and started crying because they were terrorised by this black man,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She called for a &#8216;heated debate&rsquo; about race, saying: &#8216;This series will change the terms of the debate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other films in the series will be presented by BBC presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy alongside Channel 4&rsquo;s Aarathi Prasad.</p>
<p>A two-part documentary, Plastic Surgery and Race, will look at how Michael Jackson&rsquo;s  face changed over the years and will speak to six people who want to &#8216;westernise&rsquo; their bodies and faces.</p>
<p>The Event: How Racist Are You?, will see a former US schoolteacher Jane Elliott recreate a controversial exercise she first tried 40 years ago to teach nine-year-olds about prejudice.</p>
<p>Presented by Krishnan Guru-Murthy, the experiment will ask 30 British adults to experience what it is like to be discriminated against based on the colour of their eyes.</p>
<p>The Human Zoo: Science&rsquo;s Dirty Secret will tell the poignant story of Ota Benga, a Batwa pygmy from the Belgian Congo, who was first put on display at the 1904 St Louis World&rsquo;s Fair and then the Bronx Zoo where he was labelled as the &#8216;missing link&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The final film, Is It Better to be Mixed Race? will ask whether there could be biological advantages to have parents of different races.</p>
<p>A Channel 4 spokesperson said: &#8216;This new season of programmes sets out to explode some of the myths about race and science and to cast light on the history and consequences of scientific racism.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Season debunks the myths about science and race  &mdash;  science has been misused to legitimise racist beliefs and practices  &mdash;  these programmes are the antidote to that.</p>
<p>&#8216;Season roundly dismisses the ideas: that race is a predictor of intelligence; that racial purity has scientific benefits and that any one race is superior to another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The season was commissioned by C4 science commissioning editor David Glover and will run for two weeks from 26th October, starting with Race and Intelligence: Science&rsquo;s Last Taboo.<br>

		<p>&#8220;In Race and Intelligence: Science&rsquo;s Last Taboo, Omaar talks to academics who believe that aspects of the human brain are linked to race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any academic worth his salt who is honest knows full well that racial differences are valid without question.</p>
<p>But I can assure everybody that they will &#8220;expose&#8221; the &#8220;theory&#8221; as false. Then, don&rsquo;t be surprised if the entire cast doesn&rsquo;t end the show by holding hands, swaying from side to side, singing I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while all that is going on, the people in the Balkans are still hating each other, one tribe or another in Africa will be macheting another, and the Malaysians will be wrecking Chinese stores and markets, trying to drive them out.  The blacks and Hispanics in L.A. will be killing each other if they venture into the other&rsquo;s &#8220;hood,&#8221; because of their race, while the other blacks in Africa will be protesting the fact that whites are outperforming them academically and in ALL the professions.</p>
<p>And throughout the world blacks will continue to fail mentally in every endeavor they attempt and resort to crime, because they can&rsquo;t compete and they like easy money much more than working for it.</p>
<p>And the idea left to the viewer at the end of the show is that everybody&rsquo;s the same, which, of course, will result in interminable attempts to close achievement gaps worldwide and when they can&rsquo;t they will do as they do now: Blame it on whites who are responsible for blacks being unintelligent.</p>
<p>If they would truthfully entitle the program, it would by calling it, &#8220;Lying into the future. The myth continues&#8221;</p>

		<p>That there are clearly established genetic differences in intelligence between races is known even to the most ardent liberal, however hysterically he denies what he knows to be obvious.  It&rsquo;s known to anybody who&rsquo;s ever worked among black Africans, mestizos, and Australian aboriginals.  It&rsquo;s known to every scholar and scientist who&rsquo;s quantitatively studied the questions of race and intelligence.  And yet denial of the obvious has shaped public policy in this country and most of Europe to the point of criminalizing the recognition of the obvious and demonstrable truth. And it&rsquo;s shaped public policy to the point of squandering hundreds of billions of dollars in the maintainence of this absurd fantasy.  It&rsquo;s impeding the successful operation of national economies as it attempts to bring intellectually disadvantaged minorities into the mainstream.  It&rsquo;s hamstrung law enforcement efforts by refusing to recognize that certain minorities, despite the overwhelming statistical evidence, commit the overwhelming majority of all crimes, especially violent crimes.  It&rsquo;s caused the inconvenience and harassment of millions of clearly harmless citizens by forcing them to submit to searches of their persons and possessions in airports and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because of a perverse fear of giving offense to the real criminal class we choose to give offense to the innocent and law-abiding.</p>
<p>Truly, whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.  </p>

		<p>This sounds like pure p.c. propaganda. First they&rsquo;ll have on the loathesome Jane Elliot. Then they&rsquo;ll whine about the time my namesake placed a pygmy in a cage in the Bronx Zoo a century ago.  </p>
<p>Next they&rsquo;ll tell the young people that it&rsquo;s better to have mixed-race children. They&rsquo;ll conclude by &#8220;debunking&#8221; the fact of genetic racial IQ differences.</p>
<p>The only bright spot is that millions of viewers will hear Profs Lynn and Rushton speaking the God-honest truth and some will look them up on the internet to be further enlightened. </p>

		<p>Fascinating!  I have the books by Lynn, Rushton, Murray/Herinstein and have subscribed to AmRen for years.  These and a few other sources accumulate immense amounts of data that not only are race and IQ linked but they are linked in very specific and consistent ways, world wide.  Further, the exhibited capabilities of the various races are consistent with IQ based predictions.<br>
What I find fascinating is that apparently King and cohorts are going to admit these data and yet deny the obvious conclusions.  Surely they will be reduced to claiming that the massive data are somehow bogus!<br>

		<p>Yes, yes&hellip;get the conversation going, by all means.</p>
<p>One of the biggest barriers we face is the taboo that&rsquo;s been in place against even discussing certain subjects. If the other side wants to aid us in the crucial first step of overcoming those taboos, well&hellip; whoopee!</p>
<p>Where I post in MSM, I have various user names so I can quote my own posts and argue with them&hellip;quoting my own posts is the only way I&rsquo;ve found to keep the points in my posts up on the threads (since my original posts often get taken down), and I do present the best arguments I can think of for the other side (which keeps THOSE posts up of course), and then I try to shoot those posts down in turn (always quoting some version of the original ideas, to keep them in play), and so on and so on&hellip;when the chain gets long enough, the flaggers and the monitors seem to run out of steam.</p>
<p>My purpose has become less to convince anyone of anything than to simply keep in &#8220;discussion&#8221; ideas that before haven&rsquo;t been allowed to be discussed (IQ differences, benefits of segregation, etc.)&hellip;.I assume that that alone will lend a certain increased legitimacy to those ideas in readers&rsquo; minds.</p>

		<p>This is a dangerous game.  No doubt Channel 4 is planning an ambush, but look what has been printed in the Daily Mail: honest quotes and paraphrases from Richard Lynn, J.  Phillipe Rushton, and James Watson.  Some people may not recognize it, but they will at least hear the truth.  Our side doesn&rsquo;t get many chances like this.  </p>

<p>They have recently made sympathetic documentaries about Enoch Powell and the BNP. Nick Griffin has been invited to participate on Question Time.</p>
<p>Now they are giving legitimacy to scientists who believe that the black-white IQ gap is genetic in origin.</p>

		<p>What a horrid little series!<br>
 Apart from the fact that the differential IQ rates between black and White in the USA have been tested, tested, tested, studied, anatomized and pored over obsessively for over a century - and the difference remains an incontrovertible fact despite the damndest efforts of an entire &#8216;scientific establishment&rsquo; with unlimited funds to overturn it, I find that the attempts to gang-up on poor old Bruce Forsyth, for some well meaning and well intentioned words offensive in the extreme.Brucie was merely trying to defuse a heated argument in his own way.<br>
 In explanation to all you Americans and continental readers, Bruce Forsyth (or &#8216;Brucie&rsquo;) is a living legend of British TV. A veteran game-show host, entertainer, comedian, singer and dancer, dear old Brucie (&#8216;the kng of Saturday night), is one of the most loved personages in Britain.<br>
 Leave Brucie alone.</p>

		<p>Oona King has an interesting back story.<br>
The child of a prominent Jewish family (she&rsquo;s related to playwright Tom Stoppard)and an &#8216;exiled&rsquo; black American political agitator, Oona king rose to prominence as a Labour MP for Bethnal Green (Jack the Ripper&rsquo;s old stomping ground), a constituency which is roughly 90% Bangladeshi muslim.<br>
 King of course scored double points in the diversity stakes and was given a supposedly rock solid Labour seat without much struggle.On being elected Oona King was most anxious to attain high ministerial office and therefore voted the party line in every contentious free vote in the &#8216;commons&rsquo;.Then came the Iraq war - despite having a 90% muslim constituency that hated that war, Ms King voted pro-Blair and pro-war.<br>
 Now enter George Galloway.The hard-left firebrand and muslim sympathiser capitalized on the anger that Ms. King engendered amongst the Banngladeshis and formed the &#8216;Respect&rsquo; party to eject Oona KIng from office.<br>
 The result ? A massive Labour majority was overturned at the next election and George Galloway was returned as MP.</p>

		<p>These programs always start out with the agenda to show that these &#8220;racist&#8221; scientist are all wrong about average intelligence and race so that when these scientists interviewed start sounding too convincing they edit those parts out. Then they&rsquo;ll have a lot of annoying horror stories about past racial injustice that really have nothing to do with what the scientists are trying to say. They will distort what they say and the whole show will probably be a sham - perhaps as bad as the November 22, 1994  Peter Jennings ABC News broadcast described here:</p>

		<p>Lynn and Rushton are both very good scientists, but do either of them have any theories that at least attempt to explain why their work has been banned from &#8220;polite&#8221; society? </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the public expression of race &#8220;realism&#8221; incompatable with (free market, open borders) capitalism?</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that the suppression of their work can be explained by any of Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s ideas or the misuse of racial theories by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Very few serious, rational human beings privately believe in any kind of equality, but it seems that many are perfectly fine with promoting this &#8220;noble&#8221; lie publicly. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that they think it is in their interest to expouse these absolutist culture-only theories of achievement (which are everywhere today).</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s naive to believe that this kind of research is being suppressed simply because &#8220;liberal&#8221; professors would rather live with a self-comforting fiction like equality than face the truth.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I think there are much more powerful and much more rational forces at work here.</p>

&#8220;Oona King, Channel 4&rsquo;s head of diversity, said the programme will show conclusively &lsquo;that you cannot link race to IQ&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
She said it   &mdash;   but made no attempt to back it up or substantiate it in any way. </p>
<p>The statement was not substantiated in any way largely because that statement CAN&rsquo;T be substantiated. It can only be repeated ad nauseum, until it becomes accepted as &#8220;common wisdom&#8221; by those too tired or too outgunned to fight it off. Because ALL credible literature on the subject points to the polar opposite of this statement, i.e. that there ARE differences in intelligence between the races   &mdash;   and some of those differences are not trivial but really quite large, gaping, and probably unbridgeable. </p>
<p>That said, I eagerly await this program turning up on Youtube. Anytime Profs. Lynn and Rushton are given the opportunity to air their findings to a mass audience   &mdash;   no matter how hostile the context   &mdash;   is cause for celebration. </p>
<p>I myself was introduced to the notion of racial differences in IQ from reading the long interview with Prof. William Shockley in a 1980 Playboy magazine   &mdash;   despite the fact that Playboy was running the piece with the intention of <i>debunking</i> Shockley, not promoting him. </p>
<p>Despite this attempt on Hefner&rsquo;s part to dismiss Shockley&rsquo;s science as pseudoscience, the factuality of the Professor&rsquo;s message got through to me, and set me on an intellectual path very different from the one I&rsquo;d been on&hellip; a path which eventually led me to this website. </p>

		<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing they won&rsquo;t have Lynn or Rushton debate the academics that disagree with them?</p>
<p>It would be a terrible thing to have the agenda of the documentary crushed, after all.  My money is on all of these &#8216;academics&rsquo; they have lined up using either the cultural bias theory (without explaining why NE asians score higher than whites) or simply saying that IQ isn&rsquo;t a good measure for intelligence.</p>

		<p>I hope noone thinks that this will be an objective treatment of race. This will be edited and cut to make Rushton and the others look like fools and haters. Anything  that supports their viewpoint will be cut out. They will film many hours of video and use only the negative. If there isn&rsquo;t anything negative, they will manufacture it.</p>

		<p>#12 Burt, I like to imagine what it would be like if there was complete honesty and freedom to talk about race and for whites to have organizations with whatever racial exclusions they wanted. Imagine TV news about racial problems always mentioning the race factor. Imagine debates about immigration which included talking about changing the national gene pool. What about school children being taught that whites are smarter than blacks? Yet there would still have to be laws requiring blacks as individuals to be treated fairly in the courts and business. This would mean government supported segregation is not possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a society like that could work in the modern world. The friction, bad feelings, and tension would be unbearable to most people. That&rsquo;s why I think race denial has become so powerful. I just wish common sense would prevail about changing the racial balance of countries through immigration. Governments have let their anti-racism programs become fanatical in the immigration debate. </p>

		<p>The BBC made a fairly objective documentary about race scientist Hans Eysenck a few years ago. Judge for yourself:</p>

<p>Hopefully they will treat Richard Lynn and Philippe Rushton with the same level of neutrality, but I have my doubts.</p>

		<p>American Indians have an IQ of 87? Funny, seems nobody told the Cherokee that. We&rsquo;re the most educated Native nation in the Americas.  Part of it I think is our competitive nature and the fact we tend to value people who speak well and know a situation inside and out.  The speaking part is likely why I went into radio as well, as it seems many Cherokee journalists tend to do.</p>
<p>Culture is a VERY salient point.</p>

		<p>Dear # 18,</p>
<p>The IQ scores that are given for &#8220;races&#8221; usually represent the average across the many different groups that comprise that that race.  In fact, the different groups within a race often differ in average IQ.  It may well be true that the Cherokee on average have a greater IQ than say the Apache or the Navajo.  I don&rsquo;t know.  However, a check of ACT and SAT scores will tell you, and this should correlate with rates of college graduation among different Indian &#8220;tribes.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Examples of this intra-racial disparity in IQ are: High IQ in Ashkenazim Jews and lower IQ in Sephardim Jews, High IQ in N.E. Chinese and lower IQ in S.E. Chinese, and High IQ in Germans and slightly lower IQ in Southern Italians and Southern Spanish.</p>
<p>Also, even within a single population, there is a wide range of individual IQ&rsquo;s.  Some individual Africans can have IQ&rsquo;s of 120 and even 130.  Whereas the smartest Jews, Asians, and Europeans can have IQ&rsquo;s of 170 or more.  But these are one-in-a-million cases.   </p>
