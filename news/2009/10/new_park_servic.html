<p>In contemporary times, however, the job of overseeing John Muir&rsquo;s &#8220;cathedrals of nature&#8221; requires presiding over fights of partisanship, science, religion and the appropriate telling of the American story.</p>
<p>For Jon Jarvis, the newly named director of the National Park Service, the future of the 391-unit system promises similar controversy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As director of the service&rsquo;s Pacific West Region, Jarvis, 56, sought diversity in park staff and visitors, established programs to make parks relevant to young people, and provided materials in Spanish and on teaching inner-city families how to camp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Citing climate change as one of the top challenges in parks, Jarvis echoed the Obama administration&rsquo;s pledge to reemphasize the role of science in federal land management decisions. Even though the park service is charged with a mission to educate, problems arise at places such as the Grand Canyon, where some visitors prefer a biblical interpretation of the canyon&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not the least bit afraid of controversy in the work that we do,&#8221; Jarvis said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re pretty good at this. It&rsquo;s our job to tell the story and without embellishment, to tell it as truthfully as possible. Based on the historical side, scholarly work; and on the natural side, scientific work. That&rsquo;s going to be the basis for our interpretation and we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One change Jarvis says he&rsquo;ll institute is to put park rangers back in classrooms. When Gale Norton was Interior secretary, she stopped that long tradition, saying it represented &#8220;mission creep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rangers&rsquo; storytelling  &mdash;  called &#8220;interpretation&#8221; in the park service  &mdash;  will also shift. Jarvis said that rangers at Civil War battlefields now spend less time telling visitors where the Confederate and Union armies lined up for Pickett&rsquo;s charge and more time discussing slavery and civil rights. Those issues are more relevant to today&rsquo;s society, he said.</p>
<p>The role of the parks, Jarvis said, is to continue to tell the American story. He said that a group of military lawyers recently toured historic Japanese internment camps, to try to get a look at &#8220;how the current internment of American citizens will appear in history,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Less time telling visitors&hellip;&#8221; I just got back from Gettysburg. And one of the things I always do is  go online to Virtual Tourist and read other posters complaints and compliments about Anywhere U.S.A. Then I go online and either reinforce or refute others observations compared to my own. Concerning Gettysburg were two complaints that I found valid. The first was that the multitude of monuments down to brigade strength made it all very hard to tell where the major action took place. When you can`t tell a regimental obelisk from the High Tide of The Confedercy marker, it makes it more difficult to get the big picture&hellip;<br>
  The other pertains to the Park Rangers and their interpretations. These guys are waaaay too into minute details that the average visitor has no knowledge of or reference point to give any understanding of the battle. Kind of like asking where Robert E. Lee Street is and getting a complete history of the cavalry horse in return. So my point is this.. Nobody listens to these guys anymore than a band geek at a pep rally. I saw the same pained look in lots of tourists eyes, not wanting to be rude but not having a clue at who or what these guys were talking about!! And looking sorry they asked and walked into a thirty minute talk about minor players in the action. So don`t worry about them preaching slavery and such. Nobody`s listening or understanding even if they do! But I must say that Pickett`s charge rocked! After we found it on our own&hellip;</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why young people and minorities aren&rsquo;t going to NPs.  After all, they get &#8220;lessons&#8221; (more like agitprop) about slavery and civil rights at home.  Why should they travel a thousand or more miles to get them?</p>

<p>Sounds like the only effort he has made is helping them fail.  How many whites want to camp with inner city kids?  Or go on a desolate path and the only face you see will be a black or brown one?  Not me.  Sorry, I&rsquo;m going to be avoiding the national parks for good if this is the new policy.</p>

		<p>So the parks have become fonts of politically motivated historical revisionism.  This is not such a big surprise, it has really been going on for a long time.  It only means that real scholars will have to research a little more.  But they are aided by computers which actually make learning all sides of issues, including details of history easier than they were say, 40 years ago.  I do think that they ought to be disclaimder that encourages more personal research if a more complete picture of a park&rsquo;s particular history is desired.  Computer kiosk&rsquo;s at places like the Gettysburg Battlefield would be helpful to those who want to see the historical ground for themselves while they are there, rather than wait to get home.</p>

		<p>Is there currently ANY aspect of American life, past or present, that isn&rsquo;t mandated to be veiwed through the impossibly murky prism of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and the greater grievance lobby?

<p>White people, the only people that go to national parks, want to hear about the actual history of the places they are visiting, not being lectured about white racism and civil rights.  How on Earth could &#8220;civil rights&#8221; be relevent to a civil war battle?  Does Jarvis actually think that white Union troops were fighting the Confederates to free black slaves?  </p>

<p>Who on earth is this freakishly pathetic old multicultural bootlicker attempting to describe here, in his idiotic and simpering frenzy of &ldquo;enlightenment?&rdquo; Is it: members of Islamic terrorist cells, illegal aliens, and the unrestrained psychopathic black criminals who overpopulate our prisons? Is that really the &ldquo;role of the parks&rdquo; Comrade Jarvis, to selectively distort history for your sanctimoniously obtained paycheck?</p>
<p>I wonder why this fecklessly wretched traitor isn&rsquo;t ordering his rangers to discuss the hypocrisy of having some degenerate and archaic white Communist run the National Park Service, and stealing the job from a more deserving nonwhite, in General Secretary BO&rsquo;s &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; and hyper-affirmative action Utopian States of America? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been camping in almost every state park and many of the National Forests from Alaska to California, from Washington State to Colorado  &mdash;  in other words, pretty much the  entire western half of the nation. I have never seen more than a single handful of non-whites at any one of them. Camping is almost exclusively a white people&rsquo;s activity.

		<p>People generally go to these parks to marvel at the fantastic terrain and other natural features. Can&rsquo;t we find respite from &#8220;white guilt&#8221; breast beaters anywhere? We are force-fed revisionist history in our schools, our television programs, etc.  <br>
   Those &#8220;issues&#8221; are more relevant in THEIR society, not in ours. I believe civil war is a very relevant subject again; but, not for the same reasons that Mr. Jarvis does. Let&rsquo;s hope that this clown in a Smoky hat runs into a hungry grizzly. </p>

		<p>In my many trips to the national parks throughout this great country I don&rsquo;t see many African Americans observing or touring the historical sites.  Sure, let&rsquo;s not talk nor discuss the battles fought during the &#8220;war of succession&#8221; but instead focus on issues that matter to blacks today: &#8220;Them Selves&#8221;.  The lives lost on both North and South matter very little to today&rsquo;s blacks as they want you to know how horrible it was for them in the past.  There should be a collection point where whites can contribute funds for the &#8220;sins of the past&#8221; and eager blacks can collect these funds to better themselves. </p>

<p>Oh jeez.  As if students today weren&rsquo;t saturated with propaganda about slavery and civil rights (read, &#8220;anti-white policies&#8221;) every day of the school year.  What they are sorely lacking is any real knowledge of the particulars of how the Civil War started and how it was fought.</p>

		<p>Just great. Now whites can&rsquo;t even go on vacation without the white guilt trip. While these Rangers are disscussing slavery and civil rights, they should also be discussing the very small percentage of whites who actually owned slaves and STATES rights.<br>
While they are at it, they should mention how these people came to be slaves, as in their own people sold them to us. Funny, I don&rsquo;t recall EVER having been told that in school. Much of what we were taught about the Civil War was totally one sided.</p>

		<p>While they are at it, telling the important story of Japanese internment during world war II, I wonder, history being the guide, if they will also tell the story of German and Italian Americans also interned in the US during WWII. Or if they will tell the important story of the internment of American citizens by the Japanese during WWII all across Asia, a great number of whom would not survive? Or would that be considered racism? </p>
<p>There is a plaque posted at highway rest stops in the state of Georgia that commemorates American prisoners held during all of America&rsquo;s wars. If you take the time to look closely, it lists the total number of Americans taken prisoner in each war in Americas history and the number that survived captivity. Around 10% of prisoners died in captivity. That&rsquo;s true for World War II also, at least for the European theater. For World War II, it lists prisoners held by Germany and in a separate category, those held by Japan. Over 50% of American prisoners held by Japan during World War II died in captivity. A stark contrast to the figures for every other war in American history. </p>

		<p>Our own National Parks are to be weapons against us.  Why go to Gettysburg to listen to some Federal employee snivle about slavery?  Preaching about Blacks&rsquo; problems at WBTS battle sites is relevant?  Were slave auctions held at Antietam?  This is a bait and switch scam, lure the White masses to revered places in our history and sell them &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  It might be fun to ask the Rangers about affirmative action and Black crime rates.  That would be relevant.</p>

		<p>several years ago I took the tour of Arlington National Cemetary. It was on a tram like thing with the driver as the tourguide. Maybe 30 or so people on the tram, about 1/2 white and black.  The black driver tourguide was only interested in black issues of course, pointing out the resting place of the first black general and the first black this and that. Even the few whites he pointed out were the ones with some kind of influence in the black experiment.  I just wanted to puke, and could tell some of the other whites felt the same way,, but as whites we just kept silent and took it.  We must stand up!! Kingfish  </p>

<p>This is just another cog in the most Evil, Genocidal machine ever built. Our children are taught responsible parenting -with the result that many don&rsquo;t have kids until their 30&rsquo;s or later. At the same time, certain other parts of our society are taught that one kid on welfare and they break even -two or more and they show enough profit that they needen&rsquo;t ever work, just have kids on the taxpayer dime as an &#8216;occupation&rsquo;. This is nothing but Eugenics applied to exterminate the smart and productive while breeding an overflowing army of &#8216;weak minds and strong backs&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I was at the Mammoth Cave in Tennessee this summer. It&rsquo;s run by the park service. There are 11 different tours that go on each day, from about an hour in length to around 3 hours. A park ranger conducts each tour. Among the helpful commentary made by our Ranger&hellip; &#8220;the government&rsquo;s going to be honest now that Obama is our president&#8221;.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, &#8216;Slavery&rsquo; was an important topic at the Mammoth caves. Apparently slaves had a part fixing up the park.</p>
<p>Important if you actually believe there was really slavery in American. I don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>If every single thing they say is a lie, told for an evil purpose, I might add, why should &#8216;slavery&rsquo; be any different? It&rsquo;s called deductive reasoning, I believe. </p>

		<p>What the PC correct &#8220;interpreters&#8221; WON&rsquo;T tell folks about the Civil War is this: when the average northern enlistee/draftee believed the war was about &#8220;preserving&#8221; the union, they went.<br>
The South fought to DEFEND it&rsquo;s soil from INVASION.  But when Lincoln announced the emancipation proclamation, and northerners were told they were fighting to FREE slaves and that blacks were equal to them, they not only REVOLTED up north, they began shooting at Union troops, and HANGING every black they could find.  THEY were NOT going to die in a bloody war so blacks could be free, and they certainly did NOT bellieve blacks were in any way equal.  More union troops and recruits had to be sent up north to New York and Boston to quell THAT rebellion at the time than were sent to battlefields.  In other words, northerners were NOT fighting to free the slaves at all, and it took UNION troops to fire upon UNION citizens to MAKE them enlist &#8220;to free the slaves&#8221; and accept blacks as &#8220;equals&#8221;.  Kinda like what is still going on today.  And THAT is Lincoln&rsquo;s legacy - the end of freedom and free association.</p>

		<p>&#8220;teaching inner-city families how to camp&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute. I thought non-whites were more &#8216;at one with nature&rsquo; than the blue-eyed devils. Why do they need camping lessons? </p>
<p>The reason I would go to a Civil War battlefied is to find out how the Union and Confederate armies &#8216;lined up&rsquo;. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Camping is almost exclusively a white people&rsquo;s activity&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. This is how it is, regardless of what the feds think it is or want it to be. Whites are the campers, hikers, etc. That sort of behavior is not in the non-white realms of activities to be enjoyed. And it is not because of lack of money, poverty, etc. It is just not something non-whites find to be pleasureable. The enjoyment or appreciation of wilderness is a &#8220;honkey&#8221; kinda thing!!</p>

		<p><i>White people, the only people that go to national parks, want to hear about the actual history of the places they are visiting, not being lectured about white racism and civil rights. How on Earth could &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; be relevent to a civil war battle? Does Jarvis actually think that white Union troops were fighting the Confederates to free black slaves?-Eric @ 7:40pm</i></p>
<p>That is precisely the point. It is not for the black audience. It is to remind, indoctrinate and humilate white people to have them listen to these chastising lectures. <br>
A captivate audience. Just like in schools.</p>
