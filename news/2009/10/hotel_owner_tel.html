<h1>Hotel Owner Tells Hispanic Workers to Change Names</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, October 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Larry Whitten marched into this northern New Mexico town in late July on a mission: resurrect a failing hotel.</p>
<p>The tough-talking former Marine immediately laid down some new rules. Among them, he forbade the Hispanic workers at the run-down, Southwestern adobe-style hotel from speaking Spanish in his presence (he thought they&rsquo;d be talking about him), and ordered some to Anglicize their names.</p>
<p>No more Martin (Mahr-TEEN). It was plain-old Martin. No more Marcos. Now it would be Mark.</p>
<p>Whitten&rsquo;s management style had worked for him as he&rsquo;s turned around other distressed hotels he bought in recent years across the country.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old Texan, however, wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what followed.</p>
<p>His rules and his firing of several Hispanic employees angered his employees and many in this liberal enclave of 5,000 residents at the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, where the most alternative of lifestyles can find a home and where Spanish language, culture and traditions have a long and revered history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former workers, their relatives and some town residents picketed across the street from the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do feel he&rsquo;s a racist, but he&rsquo;s a racist out of ignorance. He doesn&rsquo;t know that what he&rsquo;s doing is wrong,&#8221; says protester Juanito Burns Jr., who identified himself as prime minister of an activist group called Los Brown Berets de Nuevo Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After he arrived, Whitten met with the employees. He says he immediately noticed that they were hostile to his management style and worried they might start talking about him in Spanish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of that, I asked the people in my presence to speak only English because I do not understand Spanish,&#8221; Whitten says. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been working 24 years in Texas and we have a lot of Spanish people there. I&rsquo;ve never had to ask anyone to speak only English in front of me because I&rsquo;ve never had a reason to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some employees were fired, Whitten says, because they were hostile and insubordinate. He says they called him &#8220;a white (N-word).&#8221;</p>
<p>Fired hotel manager Kathy Archuleta says the workers initially tried to adjust to his style. &#8220;We had already gone through four or five owners before him, so we knew what to expect,&#8221; Archuleta says. &#8220;I told (the workers) we needed to give him a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Whitten told some employees he was changing their Spanish first names. Whitten says it&rsquo;s a routine practice at his hotels to change first names of employees who work the front desk phones or deal directly with guests if their names are difficult to understand or pronounce.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with racism. I&rsquo;m not doing it for any reason other than for the satisfaction of my guests, because people calling from all over America don&rsquo;t know the Spanish accents or the Spanish culture or Spanish anything,&#8221; Whitten says.</p>
<p>Martin Gutierrez, another fired employee, says he felt disrespected when he was told to use the unaccented Martin as his name. He says he told Whitten that Spanish was spoken in New Mexico before English. &#8220;He told me he didn&rsquo;t care what I thought because this was his business,&#8221; Gutierrez says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the firings, the New Mexico chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a national civil rights group, sent Whitten a letter, raising concerns about treatment of Hispanic workers. Whitten says he sent them a letter and posted messages on the hotel marquee, alleging that the group referred to him with a racial slur. LULAC denied the charge.</p>
<p>The messages and comments he made in interviews with local media, including referring to townsfolk as &#8220;mountain people&#8221; and &#8220;potheads who escaped society,&#8221; further enflamed tensions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whitten should have dealt with the situation differently, especially in a majority Hispanic town, said 71-year-old Taos artist Ken O&rsquo;Neil, while sipping his afternoon coffee on the town&rsquo;s historic plaza.</p>

		<p>I saw this story on Yahoo news this morning, and laughed while reading it. The original article is better than the AmRen recap, full of white guilt, apologies, denying being a racist, sympathy for the poor, mistreated workers, etc. </p>
<p>Demanding that the workers change their name was out of line, but I fully support everything else this evil, white racist did. However, he should have fired all the ingrateful Hispanics and hired tent-city-living whites. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a majority Hispanic town where the Spanish language, culture and traditions have a long and revered history, and yet they are home to something called, &#8220;the League of United Latin American Citizens&#8221;? Apparently only white folks ever need get with the times. Also Whitten claims this group sent him a letter using racial slur (can&rsquo;t get more thought out than a letter) but they paper didn&rsquo;t feel the need to go into detail about it or even discuss what it might be. They had no shortage of space when describing the things Whitten was said to have done. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why people of Mexican descent are referred to as &#8220;Latin Americans.&#8221;  Somehow, I doubt any of them are immigrants from Latium.</p>
<p>Romanians and other Vlachs are more closely related to Italians than most Mexicans are and speak a Latin-based language, yet I&rsquo;ve never heard a Romanian-American described as a &#8220;Latin American.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think that he has crossed the line by changing people&rsquo;s names. Other than that I think that requiring his employees to speak English only in his presence (he did not say at all times at work which would be OK as well) Now if the name was difficult to pronounce or people on the other end of a telephone might not understand it I might tell the person to use the english equivilent or something. I grew up with quite a few &#8220;Marteen Reechards&#8221; (spelled Martin Richard) in my French cultured hometown in Louisiana and nobody got confused. </p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s his business  &mdash;  he needs to run it as he sees fit.<br>
  I&rsquo;d rather be plain-ol&rsquo; Martin than fancy pants Mar-teen if it meant regular trips to Wal-Mart and food on the table every evening. <br>
  I&rsquo;ve had some dumb jobs with dumb rules. I have an ethnic name (very Euro-style) and I have had to simplify it down to one darned letter! AND I have a paycheck.</p>

		<p>Hollywood, Nashville, New York, and 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW have all been known to require that performers change their names in order to be successful and get movie deals. How is it that a bunch of Taos &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in a hotel that is going down the tubes can muster the chutzpah and righteous indignation to attack a turnaround artist that is trying to save their jobs??</p>

<p>The answer is b. We live in the United States of America and most of our court decisions have ruled that if it adversely affects one person, it&rsquo;s illegal. The court usually sides with the minority.</p>
<p>This can be good or bad depending on the minority and the issue.</p>

		<p>As I have understood for many years, both Spanish and English are legal languages with equal standing in New Mexico.  Can anybody verify this?  If so, these workers would be entirely within their rights, and he would be violating their rights. </p>
<p>I do think that requiring people to change their names is going too far.  After all, he just came in there,  an outsider from another state, while some of those people may have been there for generations.  He certainly hasn&rsquo;t shown much common sense or tact. I also think there should be a limit on the power any owner has over his employees.  So I have to sympathize with them.</p>

It&rsquo;s no different than the Indian help desk centers were the support staff greet you with names that are obviously not theirs like &#8220;sam&#8221;, fred&#8221;, etc.  They do that so the customers can actually pronounce the techie&rsquo;s name.  It&rsquo;s the same sort of thing.</p>

		<p>I do think he was wrong requiring people to change their names. However, if he doesn&rsquo;t want Spanish spoken by his employees in front of him, that&rsquo;s his right. There are pleny of latino businesses that will not hire people who speak english but no spanish.</p>

		<p>So the man who is using the same techniques he used to turn around (I assume successfully, as he was able to outright purchase a hotel for over a million dollars) dozens of hotels is an ignorant racist, but workers who treated their new boss with disrespect and got fired because of it are righteous activists?  Ha!</p>

I have to agree.  If I worked for a Hispanic employer, would he have the right to order me to change my name to Hernando and to speak Spanish in his presence?  I hope not. But I&rsquo;m afraid we may be coming to that. I know I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t like it!<br>

		<p>Funny thing about a job, one pretty much has to do what is expected by the owner, even if Spanish has been spoken for centuries. Either the employees want to speak Spanish, then they need to work somewhere else or starve  &mdash;  kind of like pay taxes or go to jail. If they want success at the hotel with its eventual raises, they will suck it up and speak English because the man paying the bills says so, period. By the way, it is against federal law for Spanish to be used to teach classes. This was the first stipulation the US had before accepting NM as a state. Bi-lingual classes are illegal. </p>

		<p>All the Armenian classroom aides in Glendale, California, have common American names on the job.  It makes things easier for everyone, including the aides, when names are simple for the Koreans, the Phillipinos, the Mexicans, and the Americans, to understand.  Changing your name is sometimes part of adapting to a new country.  Some Amren people might have no trouble with &#8220;Marteen&#8221; or &#8220;Hozay&#8221;, but I can tell them that plenty of decent White visitors to Southern California are clueless about La Jolla, La Canada, Conejo, Tejon, Cajon, La Brea, etc etc.  <br>
     Personally, I don&rsquo;t care about the &#8220;rights&#8221; of Mexicans in this country.  The boss can name these people&rsquo;s children for all I care.  And if it bothers someone calling itself the &#8220;Prime Minister of Los Brown Berets de Nuevo Mexico&#8221;, I&rsquo;m liking it even more.  <br>

		<p>When I was in high school, one of my first jobs was working as a front desk clerk at a small hotel owned by a Korean family who had recently become U.S. citizens.  The owner, his wife and their sons all had very Korean-sounding names that were difficult for most of their customers and employees to pronounce.  They all changed their original names to more Caucasian-sounding names (like Steven, Michael, etc.) because they thought that it would be easier for their customers (who were mainly Caucasians) to relate to them and because they thought that it would make them seem more American.  It sounds like Larry Whitten was trying to do the same thing at his hotel.  </p>

		<p>After watching the CNN news clip at the Brown Berets website (good grief!), I can&rsquo;t even think about the name-change issue, I&rsquo;m in such a rage at that CNN termagant who interviewed the hotel owner!</p>
<p>https://losbrownberetsdenuevomejico.blogspot.com/</p>
<p>How dare she talk to him like that! Like he&rsquo;s some kind of moral leper. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the angry self-righteous style of the activist left, every one of them so overstuffed with their own &#8220;virtue&#8221; that they&rsquo;re about to pop.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll lead Hispanics to the same angry, sullen, self-righteous &#8220;you owe me&#8221; attitude that so many blacks have been led to.</p>
<p>Our zeitgeist now isn&rsquo;t about assimilation, it&rsquo;s about fighting over every little cultural hangnail. </p>
<p>So we need to start appearing across the street from their demonstrations (and also having our own, independently), with our own signs, and proclaiming that it&rsquo;s our own hangnails that matter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make the signs humorously derisive&hellip;that&rsquo;s always the most satisfying.</p>

But let&rsquo;s keep issues separate here.  That&rsquo;s not from the Brown Berets. That&rsquo;s the pompous, pretentious, know-it-all representative of the media!  That snippy young miss knows better than you,  and they don&rsquo;t like the idea of you having freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that some irony?  The media are against free speech!!!<br>
