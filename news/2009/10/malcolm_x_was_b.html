<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/oct/20/malcolm-x-bisexual-black-history">Malcolm X Was Bisexual. Get Over It</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Tatchell, Guardian (Manchester), October 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>October is Black History Month in Britain  &mdash;  a wonderful celebration of the huge, important and valuable contribution that black people have made to humanity and to popular culture.</p>
<p>It is also worth celebrating that many leading black icons have been lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), most notably the US black liberation hero Malcolm X. Other prominent black LGBTs include jazz singer Billie Holiday, author and civil rights activist James Baldwin, soul singer-songwriter Luther Vandross, blues singer Bessie Smith, poet and short story writer Langston Hughes, singer Johnny Mathis, novelist Alice Walker, civil rights activist and organiser of the 1963 March on Washington Bayard Rustin, blues singer Ma Rainey, dancer and choreographer Alvin Ailey, actress, singer and dancer Josephine Baker, Olympic diving gold medallist Greg Louganis, singer and songwriter Little Richard, political activist and philosopher Angela Davis, singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman and drag performer and singer RuPaul.</p>
<p>Few of these prominent black LGBT achievers are listed on the most comprehensive UK Black History Month website, which hosts biographies of notable black men and women. In the section on people, only Davis is mentioned and her lesbianism is not acknowledged. The website fails to identify the vast majority of black public and historical figures who are LGBT. The Official Guide to Black History Month UK is equally remiss. Why these omissions? Black people are not one homogenous heterosexual mass. Where is the recognition of sexual diversity within the black communities and black history?</p>
<p>In contrast, LGBT History Month, which takes place in the UK in February, devotes a whole section of its website to the lives of leading black LGBT people and links to the websites for Black History Month. Disappointingly, this solidarity is not reciprocated. On the Black History Month websites I could not find a LGBT section or a LGBT History Month link.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is unintentional but Black History Month sometimes feels like Straight Black History Month. Famous black LGBT people are not acknowledged and celebrated. Either their contribution to black history and culture is ignored or their sexuality is airbrushed out of their biographies.</p>
<p>A good example of this neglect is the denialism surrounding the bisexuality of one of the greatest modern black liberation heroes: Malcolm X. The lack of recognition is perhaps not surprising, given that some of his family and many black activists have made strenuous efforts to deny his same-sex relationships and suppress recognition of the full spectrum of his sexuality.</p>
<p>Why the cover-up? So what if Malcolm X was bisexual? Does this diminish his reputation and achievements? Of course not. Whether he was gay, straight or bisexual should not matter. His stature remains, regardless of his sexual orientation. Yet many of the people who revere him seem reluctant to accept that their hero, and mine, was bisexual.</p>
<p>Malcolm X&rsquo;s bisexuality is more than just a question of truth and historical fact. There has never been any black person of similar global prominence and recognition who has been publicly known to be gay or bisexual. Young black lesbian, gay and bisexual people can, like their white counterparts, often feel isolated, guilty and insecure about their sexuality. They could benefit from positive, high-achieving role models, to give them confidence and inspiration. Who better than Malcolm X? He inspired my human rights activism and was a trailblazer in the black freedom struggle. He can inspire other LGBT people too.</p>
<p>Right now, there is not a single living black person who is a worldwide household name and who is also openly gay. That&rsquo;s why the issue of Malcolm X&rsquo;s sexuality is so important. Having an internationally renowned gay or bisexual black icon would do much to help challenge homophobia, especially in the black communities and particularly in Africa and the Caribbean where homosexuality and bisexuality are often dismissed as a &#8220;white man&rsquo;s disease&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what is the evidence for Malcolm X&rsquo;s bisexual orientation? Most people remember him as the foremost US black nationalist leader of the 1960s. Despite the downsides of his anti-white rhetoric, black separatism and religious superstition, he was America&rsquo;s leading spokesperson for black consciousness, pride and self-help. He spoke with fierce eloquence and defiance for black upliftment and freedom.</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s complex, changing sexuality was never part of the narrative of his life until the publication of Bruce Perry&rsquo;s acclaimed biography, Malcolm  &mdash;  The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America. Perry is a great admirer and defender of Malcolm X, but not an uncritical one. He wrote the facts, based on interviews with over 420 people who knew Malcolm personally at various stages in his life, from childhood to his tragic assassination in 1965. His book is not a hatchet job, as some black critics claim, it is the exact opposite. Perry presents an honest, rounded story of Malcolm&rsquo;s life and achievements which, in my opinion, is far more moving and humane than the better known but somewhat hagiographic The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told To Alex Haley.</p>
<p>Based on interviews with Malcolm&rsquo;s closest boyhood and adult friends, Perry suggests the US black liberation leader was not as solidly heterosexual as his Nation of Islam colleagues and black nationalist acolytes have always claimed. While Perry did not make Malcolm&rsquo;s sexuality a big part of his biography  &mdash;  in fact, it is a very minor aspect  &mdash;  he did not shy away from writing about what he heard in his many interviews.</p>
<p>He documents Malcolm&rsquo;s many same-sex relations and his activities as a male sex worker, which spanned at least a 10-year period, from his mid-teens to his 20s, as I described in some detail in a previous article for the Guardian. Although Malcolm later married and, as far as we know, abandoned sex with men, his earlier same-sex relations suggest that he was bisexual rather than heterosexual. Abstaining from gay sex after his marriage does not change the fundamentals of his sexual orientation and does not mean that he was wholly straight.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life, Malcolm&rsquo;s ideas were evolving in new directions. Politically, he gravitated leftwards. Faith-wise, after his trip to Mecca, he began to embrace a non-racial mainstream Islam. His mind was becoming open to new ideas and values.</p>
<p>Had he not been murdered in 1965, Malcolm might have eventually, like Huey Newton of the Black Panthers and the black power leader Angela Davis, embraced the lesbian and gay liberation movement as part of the struggle for human emancipation. Instead, to serve their homophobic political agenda, for over half a century the Nation of Islam and many black nationalists have suppressed knowledge of Malcolm&rsquo;s same-sex relations. It is now time for Black History Month to speak the truth. Malcolm X was bisexual. Get over it.<br>

		<p>Much to the chagrin of the marxist author of this article, Malcolm X realized that homosexuality and promiscuity were sinful, perverse, and degrading.  Malcolm X also took responsibility for his own life and preached to his fellows a strict moral code and self reliance.  He also left the Black muslims in the end.  </p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;celebrating&#8221;, to use a leftist holy word, Malcolm&rsquo;s early perversity, why not celebrate his later sexual maturity?</p>

		<p>If Malcolm X had only had some sexual liasons with other boys and men while he was in his teens and no more, I would chalk this up to experimentation and nothing more. However, once a person continues to have sexual relationships with members of the same sex from their 20s onward, the odds are that they are bisexual or homosexual. </p>
<p>I would say that Malcolm X was bisexual. </p>

		<p>Apparently not all liberal orthodoxy is equal. Of course, we already knew that, in the same way that the demographic that voted against gay marriage in the highest numbers was also black. </p>
<p>To mention that one of their black leaders was a male prostitute doesn&rsquo;t exactly fit the narrative they want told. To me it makes little difference, but I find it interesting that a recent biography PBS televised on him failed to mention it. </p>

		<p>I agree with Flamethrower&rsquo;s comment. X wouldn&rsquo;t have &#8220;embraced the lesbian and gay liberation movement&#8221; as the author of the article speculates. The fact that X defected from the black supremacist NOI and accepted traditional Sunni Islam, which admits members of all races, doesn&rsquo;t indicate a move towards leftist &#8220;gay liberation&#8221; politics. X made it clear near the end of his autobiography that he was still deeply committed to Allah, and I doubt he would have embraced something the Qur&rsquo;an expressly forbade. I see no reason to suspect his views on homosexuality would have differed from the views of traditional Sunni Islam.</p>
<p>I actually have a certain amount of respect for Malcolm X. He realized, unlike King, that you don&rsquo;t get respect by groveling and begging for it. I respect that. I also like that X advocated black separation while King called for integration. That fact alone, that he wanted separation, tells me he was smarter than King and thus also smarter than most of the present-day black community. I wish he could have gotten King&rsquo;s influence among black people. If he had, we might all be closer to solving our respective problems today.</p>

		<p>Malcolm X may or may not have been gay. But he was certainly an anti-white racist who scapegoated whitey and urged blacks to hate us and blame us for thier failures. We must continue to live with this racist legacy today.</p>
<p>Think The Guardian (or any newspaper) would allow an article on the racism of Malcolm X?</p>
<p>He was also an outright idiot who believed in flying saucers and ancient blacks who created a modern society (which is even more funny than the flying saucers).</p>

		<p>Black homosexuality is of no importance to me. What I find of interest is that the U.K. has a Black History Month. When did this celebration start, and who started it, and why? I never knew that Blacks had much history in the U.K. Also, I note the LGBT celebratory month. The U.K. is more PC than the U.S.</p>

		<p>Something tells me this isn&rsquo;t going to go over big with the African-American community. Black men are always priding themselves on their superior masculinity and sexual prowess and they aren&rsquo;t exactly tolerant of gays. Now it turns out the foremost black militant of all was fooling around with men. This is almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>Its author, Peter Tatchell (an Australian long settled in England), is a prominent (and ultra-extreme) gay-rights campaigner. (For his credentials, google his name and read, for example, his Wikipedia career resume.)</p>
<p>The gay lobby resemble Mormons in this respect (and probably ONLY in this respect): they like to claim people as one of them once those people are safely dead and cannot object.</p>

		<p>  This breathless, press agent rubbish is typical of what passes for journalism today.  The only honest and useful part of this tripe is the description of Alex Haley&rsquo;s fairytale about Malcolm as &#8220;hagiography&#8221;.  Even in its own terms, this is deficient.  The author has disregarded the fact that Richard Wright was homosexual.  Perhaps he has not heard of Richard Wright.  He actually did manage to get one or two correct  &mdash;   James Baldwin, Langston Hughes and Bayard Rustin.</p>

		<p>This jibes with a little known fact that is not spoken of. There are a lot of gay black men and probably an even larger segment who are &#8220;bi&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve seen it first-hand at the various YMCAs I&rsquo;ve been to over the years. I&rsquo;m straight but have had many black guys &#8220;cruise&#8221; me and others in the shower area. Several were married, and it was interesting to note that once they left the Y they were back to their standard macho type behavior. You would never guess that just minutes earlier they were asking other men to &#8220;make me yo&rsquo; bitch&#8221;.  This is a factoid the black population doesn&rsquo;t want &#8220;out there&#8221;. I have no animosity towards gays by the way. Whatever makes you happy, as long as you don&rsquo;t infringe upon anothers &#8220;space&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It is so easy to label Malcolm X as a bi-sexual, when the man is no longer around to answer.</p>
<p>And perhaps Malcolm X did engage in bi-sexual relationships prior to his conversion to Islam.  That does not mean that he is bi-sexual.  It just means that as an older person, he realized the error of his ways.</p>
<p>The radical homosexual agenda wants everyone to believe that.  I disagree.  People can experiment in the peculiar ways when they are young - it doesn&rsquo;t mean they continue that behavior and as far as I am concerned, whether it be homosexual, lesbian, bi-sexual or transgender - all of which are behaviors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olympic diving gold medallist Greg Louganis&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because,  within their ideology,  many of them consider that anything not fully &#8220;white&#8221; is black. Even <i>without </i> any African element at all. It&rsquo;s a simple either/or.  No in betweens.  If they&rsquo;re not white   &mdash;   100% white    &mdash;   then they&rsquo;re black.  Very arbitrary   &mdash;   one or the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, to them, a mulatto like Obama is black. A quadroon or octroon like Malcolm X is black. Why Lena Horne and Halle Berry are &#8220;black&#8221;.  Why 1/16th Vanessa Williams is &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>And why Tiger Woods, with a variety of this and that, is &#8220;black&#8221; in disregard of all the rest.</p>

		<p>One thing that people fail to understand is that Hollywood and the Media intentionally select individuals based on their political views and alternative lifestyles. These stars didn&rsquo;t just &#8220;happen&#8221; to be gay or bi or black, their careers were built because of it.  As to Malcom X, he&rsquo;s a racist, plain and simple, not deserving of any attention whatsoever. He should be shunned in the same manner that blacks shun white racists. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s documented through surveys that bisexual behavior is more common among black men, see homosexinfo.org. It&rsquo;s also a stereotype held by many white homosexuals (like myself) that black men are all bi. The prevalence of bisexuality, of course, has NOTHING do to with the fact that Black women have the fastest growing rates of HIV infection. <br>

		<p>Most of the black figures throughout history were anti-white, thugs, plagerizers, womanizers, drug users, or scam artists.  Malcolm X was no exception.  The ONLY credit I&rsquo;ll give Malcolm X is he realized what a crock the Nation of Islam was and was trying to expose it before his &#8220;oppressed brothers&#8221; killed him.  </p>

		<p>The fact that Mlacom X was a male hustler in his younger days was well documented in Alex Haley&rsquo;s The Autobiography of Malcolm X more than 40 years ago. This is hardly news.</p>

		<p>Well, had he not been murdered, he would probably contracted AIDS and spread it among his followers.  <br>
As for the rest of the list, no one there I greatly admire, for any supposed works, and especially for being practitioners of perverse lifestyles. And I have no animosity towards those people, just a disgust for the perverse behavior which is immoral.<br>
And I think that the prevalence of AIDS in black women might just BE because of sharing the men who are sharing the women AND the men.  I mean, you know what they say about who you have sex with, it&rsquo;s like having sex with all the people they are having sex with and so on and so on&hellip;  nasty.</p>

&#8220;Much to the chagrin of the marxist author of this article, Malcolm X realized that homosexuality and promiscuity were sinful, perverse, and degrading. Malcolm X also took responsibility for his own life and preached to his fellows a strict moral code and self reliance. He also left the Black muslims in the end. </p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of &ldquo;celebrating&rdquo;, to use a leftist holy word, Malcolm&rsquo;s early perversity, why not celebrate his later sexual <br>
maturity?</p>

<p>Why celebrate anything about that evil murderous puto? He was a  typcial Bantu  who abused women especially White women. He, as do many of his ilk, found &#8220;redemption&#8221; so that he could go on with his agenda and not attract too much negative attention; his agenda being the eventual annihilation of all Whites. Remember his remarks about &#8220;the chickens coming home to roost&#8221; after the Kennedy murder? Well his own chickens roosted on him. No tears.  Blacks have been enthroned as the paragons of virility while at the same time enjoying the pleasures of the  &#8220;down low&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Malcolm Little was not merely bisexual. </p>
<p>He was a homosexual rapist, a pimp, and a male prostitute, catering to white homosexual men.</p>
<p>At one time Malcolm Little was the &#8220;personal valet&#8221; for a rich young white man, the two of them habitually engaging in perverted acts!</p>
<p>Malcolm Little not only hated whitey, he probably hated himself. A danger at the time to all of American society on account of his power mixed with mental instability exacerbated by rage against himself and whitey.</p>
