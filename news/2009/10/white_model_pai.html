			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Sparks, Daily Mail (London), October 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vogue has been accused of racism for using pictures of a white girl who was &#8216;blacked up&rsquo; for a fashion shoot.</p>
<p>Dutch supermodel Lara Stone&rsquo;s face and body were plastered in dark brown make-up for a feature in this month&rsquo;s edition of the fashion bible.</p>
<p>Other pictures in the 14-page spread show her face caked in what looks like white clay, while she wears a series of bizarre hats and face masks.</p>
<p>The text accompanying the images in the magazine&rsquo;s French edition gives no hint as to why the 25-year-old model&rsquo;s skin was darkened.</p>
<p>A brief introduction merely mentions that the poses reveal Miss Stone&rsquo;s &#8216;sense of humour&rsquo;, adding that her curvy figure marks a break from the trend of &#8216;anorexic models&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It goes on to describe her somewhat cryptically as: &#8216;A real woman in body and in character for whom the pleasure  &mdash;  like the sense  &mdash;  of metamorphosis is not the least of qualities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pictures received mixed feedback on internet fashion blogs.</p>
<p>U.S. website Jezebel branded the magazine&rsquo;s editor Carine Roitfeld and photographer Steven Klein as &#8216;culturally insensitive&rsquo; for publishing them.</p>
<p>It wrote: &#8216;What Klein and Roitfeld should know is that painting white people black for the entertainment of other white people is offensive in ways that stand entirely apart from cultural context.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a reference to the furore caused last week by blacked-up contestants on an Australian TV talent show, it added: &#8216;France and Australia may not have the United States&rsquo; particular history of minstrel shows but something about the act of portraying a white woman as black ought to sound an alarm, somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>French anti-racism group SOS Racisme described the pictures as &#8216;tactless&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>And yet making black women up to look white is hip. Heck, it&rsquo;s probably racist just to observe that.</p>

		<p>Heidi Klum was a German fashion model who married and had three children with an African man.  She moved to the United States, and is now in the process of changing her last name, ridding herself of the last traces her heritage.  </p>
<p>The photos of her with her pale African children document a sad end to her European white lineage, and are more relevant than these comic Vogue pictures. </p>

		<p>And then we have Michael Jackson, a black man who dyed his skin white, surgically alterred to appear white, and he is celebrated and worshipped through his life and after his death.</p>
<p>This is the best reason I can think of to justify any &#8220;racist&#8221; feelings or thoughts, because the entire issue is pure political nonsense.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a White band that wears blueface?  Come on, it&rsquo;s theatrical makeup.  Fake hair, fake eyes, fake everything is OK onstage.  Don&rsquo;t Blacks have any real problems?</p>

		<p>Perhaps this riles them so much because it reveals their innermost yearnings, which they really know to be false, as do most black people.</p>
<p>That innermost yearning is this: They want black people to be nothing more than Whites with a dark tan. With the same values, the same commitments, the same desires.</p>
<p>You see it all the time: The Cosby Show, commercials, PC history  &mdash;  all are dedicated to the premise that black and White  people are equal, and only the color of their skin is different. </p>
<p>Not so.</p>
<p>Evolution is MUCH more than skin-deep.</p>
<p>Joyeaux Halloween!</p>

		<p>The number one selling cosmetic in India is a skin lightener.</p>
<p>African-American women use hair straightener, dye it blonde, and perform hip-hop music (just watch C+C Music Machine&rsquo;s &#8220;Make you sweat&#8221;&hellip;every body dance now!).</p>
<p>Go watch the opening part of Denzel Washington/Spike Lee&rsquo;s movie about Malcolm X, the (historical reenactment) scene where they are using such caustic hair straightener chemicals that could also burn the skin.</p>
<p>Why do they get to have all the fun?</p>

		<p>How does wearing dark makeup all over one&rsquo;s body equate to trying to mock Blacks? The article says that she also work white clay on her face. Who&rsquo;s she trying to insult there? Nothing in the picture even indicates that she was trying to imitate Blacks. What&rsquo;s annoying here is that the ones getting offended probably weren&rsquo;t even Blacks, but ultra liberals looking to find insults around every corner. That way they can point their fingers at the claimed racism and pat themselves on the back at the same time for being so enlightened and non-racist. What they really do is make themselves look like fools.</p>

		<p>I thought blacks themselves were all wearing costumes and make-up&hellip;..you mean they naturally look that way?</p>
<p>I had a Mexican girlfriend in Mexico some years ago&hellip;we used to have joking fusses over which of our skins was the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; skin of the world. I should have thought to brown myself up for her one day, and tell her I was just trying to look ordinary for her.</p>
<p>Once we were watching TV with her 11 year old and 19 year old daughters, and I asked them if they had noticed that everyone on Mexican TV was white-skinned, or nearly so.</p>
<p>They replied that that was because they all worked inside all day and didn&rsquo;t get any sun.</p>
<p>After a bit of discussion, I realized that this time they weren&rsquo;t kidding, they really believed that.</p>
<p>Another time I pressed that girlfriend to admit that Mexicans were color conscious, and looked down on those among them of darker skin. It took an incredible amount of pressing, but she finally admitted it.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m at it, let me mention that I found Mexican thought processes to be considerably different from those of all the Americans I know.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a fashion type and I don&rsquo;t know whats going on in this models head&hellip; but just maybe shes tired of the black affirmative action and quota system that is ever trying to pry its way into white lives and so she gave them her rendition of more black faces in her genre* I just don&rsquo;t know what brings a people (blacks) to BEG for respect&hellip; To demand approval from a race (white) that they claim is corrupt.</p>
