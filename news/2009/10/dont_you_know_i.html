			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lucy Ballinger, Daily Mail (London), October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A premiership footballer groped a woman in a nightclub before breaking her nose when she rejected his advances, a court has heard.</p>
<p>Marlon King, 29, allegedly shouted: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t you know who I am? I&rsquo;m a millionaire  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re not even in my league&rsquo;, before hitting the petite student in the face.</p>
<p>The £25,000-a-week Wigan Athletic striker is said to have approached the woman while she was with friends in the Soho Revue Bar in London last December.</p>
<p>She had never met King before and prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said none of the party had invited him to join them.</p>
<p>However, he said that did not stop the married father-of-three  &mdash;  who plays international football for Jamaica  &mdash;  from making advances by &#8216;sexually touching&rsquo; the 20-year-old woman on her bottom.</p>
<p>Mr Daniells-Smith told Southwark Crown Court: &#8216;It was neither welcome nor consensual. It was not an accidental brushing. This was deliberate and sexual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said the woman left King in no doubt what she thought of his behaviour and &#8216;firmly&rsquo; insisted: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t touch me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But instead of &#8216;taking the hint&rsquo;, King allegedly turned to two other women in the party and started touching them around their necks and chins.</p>
<p>Mr Daniells-Smith said they too told him to stop and he turned back to the student, stroking her hair.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;She told him to stop. He replied &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you know who I am? I&rsquo;m a millionaire&#8221;. She replied, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care who you are, take your millionaire self away&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;She brushed his hand away, but he grabbed her wrist. She then pushed him away on the chest and at that moment Marlon King took one step backward and smashed her in the face with a clenched fist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Security staff at the club intervened and took him away.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept as she listed the injuries caused by the punch.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It split my lip, broke my nose and gave me a black eye. It felt like I was bleeding everywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Wigan Athletic star&rsquo;s alleged victim was then handed a photo taken on a friend&rsquo;s mobile shortly after the attack.</p>
<p>Looking at the picture she told the court: &#8216;That&rsquo;s me. That is blood from my face that dripped down my dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The student had earlier told the court how King had grabbed her then touched up her friends before turning his attention back to her.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;He gave me a dirty look and started shaking his head at me.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then he was in my face saying &#8220;you&rsquo;re not even in my league, love, I&rsquo;m a multi-millionaire&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;I just carried on asking him to leave.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m quite a lot smaller than him and he looked over my head at my friends, saying &#8216;get this girl away from me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then he started poking me in the head, pushing my temple like he was enjoying it, repeating &#8220;not even in my league&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was quite offended but was trying to be controlled. I kept on repeating &#8220;take your multi-millions and leave  &mdash;  no one cares, just get away from the table&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;He started playing with my hair, pulling it. It wasn&rsquo;t hard  &mdash;  he was taunting everyone.</p>
<p>&#8216;I felt tiny, I felt really embarrassed. I felt like he was invading my personal space.</p>
<p>&#8216;I did a shooing motion with my hand at which point he grabbed my wrist and pulled it down.</p>
<p>&#8216;That made me lean forward a bit at which point one of my friends grabbed his arm, saying &#8216;get off her&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then he let go in such a way to push my friend back and when I looked up he punched me in the face.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was hard enough to knock me off my feet. I fell back and he was still coming at me so my friend moved me away from the situation at which point I put my hand to my face and felt that I was bleeding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The barrister told jurors that King was on loan to Hull City at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>The footballer, from Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, denies one count of sexual assault and one of causing actual bodily harm.</p>
<p>He claims although he was at the club, he was the victim of &#8216;mistaken identity&rsquo; and did not attack the woman. The trial continues.</p>

		<p>Ask anyone in government, the media, or at universities, and they will confirm that &#8220;We are all enriched by the vibrancy and color brought to us by diversity and multiculturalism,&#8221;  and that multiculturalism allows us to &#8220;experience new ways of doing things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a possibility that the government and media are lying?</p>

		<p>Blacks react violently when they are rebuffed by women.  I believe that many times women, especially white women, are intimidated by black males and their sexual advances, but the fear of being a &#8220;racist&#8221; makes them comply. The media is complicit in this fact with their endless movies, comedies and commercials where white women are smitten with black males.  Black males believe that secretly every white woman wants them and when that illusion is shattered they react with the temperment of a child that has been denied his way.  </p>

		<p>The papers will write up an expose&rsquo; showing how the player was raised poor, a trouble youth in Jamaica, and alongside there will be another article about &#8216;racism&rsquo; or economic-disparaties in the UK, and girls will take home the lesson that next time they should be more accomodating to Mr. King</p>

		<p>Yeah it was mistaken identity.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that they think all women want them, but add some money to the mix, and they feel they are irrestible.  What an egotistical, stupid creature.  And now his wife has to pretend in court that he is an upstanding member of society.  Disgusting.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s possible this girl was not white, regardless many young white women have had the privilege of being harrassed this way by black men who would be nothing more than street people save for the fact that they can run around on a patch of grass chasing a ball a tad faster than other men with more character.</p>
<p>I would like to commend this girl and her friends, white or nonwhite, for serving this buffoon a piece of hard earned humble pie with their firm and consistent rejections, even if it cost her a broken nose.</p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, this case also illustrates very well that despite the bravado, the status and the money, these black men KNOW they are all flash and no substance. He hits one bump in the road and has a meltdown.</p>
<p>I like this excerpt: &lsquo;Then he started poking me in the head, pushing my temple like he was enjoying it, repeating &ldquo;not even in my league&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not trying to convince her, he&rsquo;s trying to convince himself, to recover from the shattering blow to his ego, drowning out the voice in his head telling him without the paycheck he&rsquo;s just another obnoxious black man.</p>

		<p>The wonderful black athlete.  A millionaire now,  a penniless bum in a few years. Happens all the time.  For some reason so many of these blacks need the approval of white women.  When the white women are not impressed,  the black lashes out in violence. Fortunately there are still plenty of white women who are not impressed with any athletes, especially black ones.  Poor little Marlon got his feelings hurt, and his ego got slapped down.  All the money in the world can&rsquo;t buy class, civility, and brains.</p>

<p>I wonder if the woman will be prosecuted for saying no to a Black man.  Probably not.  Britain, after all, is a &#8220;civilized&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant&#8221; nation.   </p>

<p>&#8220;She brushed his hand away, but he grabbed her wrist. She then pushed him away on the chest and at that moment Marlon King took one step backward and smashed her in the face with a clenched fist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there is no inkling - as reported - that this was just another typical &#8220;Black&#8221; on White crime. Common sense, though, tells us it was. Perhaps White British women should develop a little &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221; so that they might enjoy the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of &#8220;celebrating diversity&#8221;</p>

		<p>So the &#8220;Security staff at the club intervened and took him away.&#8221; also made a mistake?</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>Why were there no White males in close proximity to intervene before this guy&rsquo;s natural instincts took over?  Expect more of this behavior as the percentage Britian&rsquo;s White decreases.</p>

		<p>Black men have a tendency to be very aggressive in their pursuit of women. Indeed it was very common for married African students to go after many women as possible in my University. I knew a reasonably pretty East Indian girl who always complained about aggressive Nigerian men. She claimed that White, Indian, Middle Eastern men and East Asian men normally let go after a &lsquo;no&rsquo; but black men would keep on pestering her and never accepted rejection. She knew a married Nigerian guy who wanted to have sex with her even when she said (lied) that she had a boyfriend. Black men believe no woman can/ should ever reject them. But so many women finally give in and ruin their lives. My Indian friend claimed that in India such men would have been beaten by the locals (African students in India regularly are). But unfortunately that is impossible in the west.</p>

		<p>I work security at a nightclub that has 3 days per week allocated for &#8220;urban&#8221; music.  Exclamations about money; how much they supposedly have, how much they have supposedly spent that night, are generally the first thing out of their mouth when I come after them for bad behavior.  I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say I hear, at least fifteen times a night, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t do _______!  I -=make=- money!&#8221;  I have no idea what the connection is between money and an excuse for bad behavior, I guess it is a cultural thing.</p>
<p>This will come as no surprise to regular Amren readers, but I could practically fill a week&rsquo;s worth of headlines on this site with the shenanigans I see nightly on one of these urban nights at the club.</p>

		<p>I know people always say this, and I&rsquo;m always against captain-save-a-ho&rsquo;s that jump to defense of ladies that may have been insulted in hopes that the affronted woman may sleep with their &#8220;defender,&#8221; but had I been in that club and witnessed a black man punch a White woman I would have gladly spent a few nights in prison for what I would have done to him.</p>
<p>As a White I don&rsquo;t think I can even stomach the idea of this happening. When it happens, it&rsquo;s as if you get punched too. </p>

		<p>Why Wouldn&rsquo;t He Grope Her? blacks feel white males fear them and will do nothing to stop their harassment of any female in particular the white female. Can you blame them for feeling this way when they grope or harass a white guys sister and he giggles like a little schoolgirl as he watches? Maybe they are right and white males have lost their manhood?</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the very first thing to do when an athlete who,s possibly had a bit too much to drink starts behaving like that.</p>

		<p>Its typical of black males. Arrogant, bully, (and of course a coward) sense of entitlement, and a childish, deep-seated immaturity when they realize their self-inflated perceptions of themselves bare no relation to reality. With equal immaturity they react violently like a spoiled child not getting his way. I hope she is able to sue him. </p>

		<p>Some good news.</p>
<p>His latest soccer club has announced that he will never play for them again.</p>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/8332728.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/8332728.stm</a></p>
<p>Wigan set to dismiss striker King</p>
<p><br/>
King will be left without a club once he has served his sentence<br/>
Wigan chairman Dave Whelan says Marlon King will never play for the club again after he was jailed for 18 months.<br/>
The striker, 29, was found guilty of sexual assault and actual bodily harm after he had been &#8220;cold-shouldered&#8221; by a student in a London nightclub.<br/>
The incident occurred last December while he was on loan at Hull.<br/>
Whelan told BBC Radio 5 live: &#8220;We will now be in the process of severing his contract. To say the least I am really really disappointed.&#8221;<br/>
King spent a subsequent spell on loan at Middlesbrough before returning to the Latics in the summer, but he will now be left without a club.<br/>
In 2002 he served five months of a two-year prison sentence for handling a stolen car before being released on appeal.<br/>
The Jamaica international started his league career with Barnet, before moving to Gillingham.<br/>
He was also signed to Nottingham Forest, who briefly loaned him out to Leeds United, and subsequently Watford - before eventually moving to Wigan.</p>

He should be kept out of football altogether. The only drawback to this will be another disgruntled black  fallen down and  only too ready to blame the white folks,and then look for revenge on our society.<br/>

		<p>King will be left without a club once he has served his sentence<br/>
Marlon King will never play for the club again  <b></b></p>
<p><b>The incident occurred <i>last December </i>&hellip; </b><br/>
King spent a subsequent spell on loan at Middlesbrough before returning to the Latics in the summer&hellip;<br/>

<p>The incident occurred LAST DECEMBER, and here we are just 4 days short of November!  Meanwhile, this whole year, this &#8220;millionaire&#8221; has been making a fortune kicking a ball.  What kind of &#8220;justice&#8221;  is this?</p>
<p>After his sentence, will he get a fat contract in Ecuador or Bulgaria, or somewhere such?</p>
<p>I hope not!  I hope his career is over, for good, and he ends up washing dishes   &mdash;  -  BACK IN JAMAICA!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to check back on him 20 years from how and see what&rsquo;s become of this irrestible lothario.<br/>
