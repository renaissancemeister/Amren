<h1>Undocumented Patients Wary of Offers to Return to Home Countries</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Madison Park, CNN, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Going back to Mexico is not an option, said the 43-year-old man, kneeling next to his wife&rsquo;s wheelchair.</p>
<p>His wife, 45, lost her eyesight to diabetes. She also has high blood pressure. And her kidneys are failing.</p>
<p>For years, he has taken her to a dialysis clinic attached to a public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The facility that gave her free care plans to close Saturday.</p>
<p>They are illegal immigrants with no health insurance and, they say they have nowhere to go for his wife&rsquo;s vast medical needs. The closing clinic offered to help return them to Mexico.</p>
<p>The Atlanta clinic is the latest known case of a medical institution that&rsquo;s offering to send illegal immigrants who can&rsquo;t afford treatment back to their native countries  &mdash;  a practice that critics liken to patient dumping.</p>
<p>Returning to the country of origin is completely voluntary, said Matt Gove, a spokesman for Atlanta&rsquo;s Grady Memorial Hospital. {snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Latino in America&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hospitals have offered medical transfers to foreign countries, but there are no nationwide data tracking the practice. It&rsquo;s unclear how many undocumented patients have returned and whether the repatriations are voluntary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Medical repatriations are happening because hospitals bear the financial burden for uncompensated care, said one expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they have a large volume of uncompensated care or people who aren&rsquo;t able to pay their bills, and they have limited resources coming in from the government and from insurers, they have to do the best they can,&#8221; said Carla Luggiero, a senior associate director of federal relations for the American Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Some question who should be responsible for the medical care of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no reason why the U.S. taxpayers should have to pick up the tab- when the person is a citizen of another country  &mdash;  it ought to be the responsibility of that government,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR, a group that favors strict limits on immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In Mexico, dialysis does not guarantee life like it does here,&#8221; G.L. [an otherwise unidentified illegal] said. &#8220;Maybe they live one year. Here, people can last up to 10 years or more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp.; To go back to Mexico would be a death sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A judge ruled last week that Grady could close this week, rejecting a legal request by 36 patients who sought to keep the clinic open until they could find permanent treatment elsewhere. The hospital agreed to pay for three more months of dialysis at a different clinic, according to a court document.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By federal law, hospitals must treat emergency patients regardless of citizenship or ability to pay. But emergency care is more expensive than regular care. Dialysis is a lifelong treatment and the only alternative is a transplant.</p>
<p><b>Financial challenges</b></p>
<p>Grady&rsquo;s dialysis clinic provides care to the poor and uninsured regardless of citizenship.</p>
<p>Crippled by the economy and growing financial pressures, the public hospital, which served about 724,000 patients last year, has a $33 million deficit. Its dialysis clinic has a $2 million deficit and needs another $2 million to upgrade its equipment, said Grady&rsquo;s attorney, Bernard Taylor. More than half of its 96 patients were illegal immigrants</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Patients said the clinic gave them three options: Use emergency rooms, move to another state or leave the country.</p>
<p>Paul Root Wolpe, director of Emory University&rsquo;s Center for Ethics, said that when it comes to repatriating patients, the choices are not always black and white.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have an illegal immigrant sent home to their death where they don&rsquo;t have access to proper care is ethically indefensible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Assuming they can get proper care, it&rsquo;s no different than sending anyone home if they are in a country illegally. The gray area has to do with sending someone home to significantly inferior care.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Grady spokesman declined to say how many of its dialysis patients returned to their countries. At least six patients returned to Mexico, and one is in the process, according to the Mexican consul in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Sonal Ambegaokar, a health policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which protects the rights of low income immigrants, expects medical deportations to increase as long as health care problems remain unresolved. {snip}</p>

		<p>They claim returning to Mexico is a death sentence. That is so far from the truth. I&rsquo;m in Monterrey Mexico studying. The public health system here may not have a great infrastructure, but it works. If one has no insurance, there is always the Cruz Roja (Red Cross) and it&rsquo;s FREE.</p>
<p>There are public hospitals that charge based on ability to pay. If you are so poor you cannot pay there is Serguro Popular. In other words, all Mexicans and some foreigners are insured by work, government, or private insurance.</p>
<p>If this person mentioned in the article returns to Mexico, he will receive dialysis at a public hospital. Why didn&rsquo;t the reporter verify this man&rsquo;s claim as a good reporter should? </p>

		<p>Mexico has a socialized medical system and it does not give free medical care to Americans or anyone not Mexican. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just waiting for illegal  Mexicans to start screaming in the streets  that they have a RIGHT to have free medical care from our hospitals, the same way they scream that they have a right to come here and stay.And a lot of white Americans will support them.</p>

<p>Well, the &#8220;critics&#8221; are dead wrong.  It is the illegal alien patients that dump themselves on our hospitals.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have an illegal immigrant sent home to their death where they don&rsquo;t have access to proper care is ethically indefensible&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, really?  So, every sick person in the world from a poor country has a right to come and break into our country and steal our medical services for life?  How &#8220;ethical&#8221; is that?<br>

		<p>Free healthcare for illegals or not  &mdash;  their three (or more) anchor babies will get their free healthcare through medicaide or through state subsidized health insurance(available in some states) without Obama lifting a finger.  This is the real scandal that even mainstream conservative news sources will rarely touch.  The dirty secret is that the immigrants don&rsquo;t need Obama to cement their foothold here  &mdash;  they would be doing just fine under McCaine as well.</p>

		<p>They should go home for it is cruel to die in a strange country.</p>
<p>We should make an offer to these people. If they die in the USA, they will be buried here. They will be running for the border so fast.</p>
