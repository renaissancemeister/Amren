<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>OVERSEAS students struggle to find full-time employment, even though many are bound to courses to fill vital skills shortages in Australia, a study commissioned by the Federal Government says.</p>
<p>A large number of students fail on numerous occasions to be short-listed for an interview. Some graduates found only part-time work in their chosen field and supplemented their income by working in restaurants or shops.</p>
<p>Migrants qualified in hairdressing were very likely to find work, but participation rates were low in the food and hospitality industries. Few recent migrants who qualified in building had found work in their trade, particularly those from non-English speaking backgrounds.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s project director, Sophie Arkoudis, of the Centre for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Melbourne, said students&rsquo; inability to assimilate culturally was a problem. She said overseas students often treated the importance of being able to communicate in a social setting as irrelevant.</p>
<p>The study, The Impact of English Language Proficiency and Workplace Readiness on the Employment Outcomes of Tertiary International Students, was conducted last year just before the emergence of the global financial crisis and changes to the skilled migration program.</p>
<p>Ms Arkoudis said skilled migrants were still required in Australia for critical shortages in the health and medical sectors, engineering and IT professions. &#8220;The students are very fixed on completing their course,&#8221; she said. &#8220;However, many students may not see learning social language skills as relevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Australian employers interviewed sought &#8216;well-rounded employees who not only have sufficient English language skills but also have the cross-cultural ability and the potential to adapt to the Australian workplace&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Education Minister, Julia Gillard, said key employer groups were being contacted to seek their response to the findings. He said that talks would also be held with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the subject of preparing migrants for the workplace.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the report contained good news because it showed that 85 per cent of independent migrants who had studied in Australia found employment within six months of graduating.<br>

<p>No, they believe communicating in <i>English</i>, in <i>Australia</i>, is &#8220;irrelevant&#8221;:<br>
And they <i>want</i> immigrants possessing this kind of arrogance to live and work in Australia?</p>
<p><i>Ms Arkoudis said skilled migrants were still required in Australia for critical shortages in the health and medical sectors, engineering and IT professions. &ldquo;The students are very fixed on completing their course,&rdquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;what could be cause of those &#8220;critical shortages&#8221;?<br>
If you have any answer other than &#8220;unsustainable-population-growth-driven-by-mass-Third-World-migration&#8221;, I&rsquo;d be disappointed.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;However, many students may not see learning social language skills as relevant.</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a new game for non-American-Renaissance readers, or maybe just any white who&rsquo;ll read this article and conclude that it&rsquo;s the fault of anyone else but the immigrant:<br>
<b>Go to any non-English-speaking, non-European country without learning the language as an &#8220;immigrant&#8221; (<i>NOT</i> a tourist) and see how far that gets you</b>.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The Australian employers interviewed sought &lsquo;well-rounded employees who not only have sufficient English language skills but also have the cross-cultural ability and the potential to adapt to the Australian workplace&rsquo;.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Huh. According to the &#8220;diversity&#8221; section in the business textbooks at college, that&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnocentrism&#8221; and &#8220;not conducive to a positive working environment&#8221;!</p>

		<p>To be fair, this isn&rsquo;t strictly restricted to African/Asian migrants. I&rsquo;ve seen many Dutch/German (I can&rsquo;t tell) immigrants that seem to fell the same way. If ANYONE wants to come to Australia then they should learn English, they should also pass a dictation test to ensure that they can fit in and not form enclaves.</p>

		<p>This is an enormous scam, a way to enter Australia by the back door. Mainly Indians are involved - they sign up to do a course such as hairdressing or cookery, attend a few lessons, then drop out. The next step is try for unrelated work. There is a thriving black market in sham marriages, forged English language exams and bogus courses, our once-respected international education sector has turned into a recognised immigration racket.</p>
<p>The Punjab is the main source of Indian students in Australia, &#8220;contract marriages&#8221; are openly advertised for aspiring immigrants to partners who have passed the mandatory English test for a student visa. Agents then arrange bank documents and loans to satisfy Australian immigration law (students must have the means to support themselves for the duration of their course). </p>
<p>Several private colleges have been closed down by the government, the recent &#8216;racist attacks&rsquo; on Indians attracted attention to the scam. Amusing that most of the &#8216;racist attacks&rsquo; were carried out by Lebanese and Africans, both group hates Indians - multiculturalism at its finest!</p>

		<p>There would be plenty of white immigrants available to Australia if the liberal Aussies weren&rsquo;t so self-hating.  A number of years ago (I forget the details, perhaps someone else does) an Australian MP suggested allowing Rhodesians to come to Australia as refugees because of the Mugabe-ordered exterminations.  Another white MP said no UNLESS the resettlement program also included blacks.  The refugee program went no where.</p>
<p>If Australia needs people (which considering the drought situtation seems unlikely) there are plenty of whites trapped in non-white countries they could take.  Many of them English speaking.  People who would assimilate.  But no they continue on the failed multi-racial path.  Maybe we deserve to perish.</p>

<p>Here we go, the old &#8220;vital skills shortage&#8221; scam. It&rsquo;s amazing that all of sudden, there is this great skills shortage that didn&rsquo;t exist 20 years ago, especiall since the Western world is in a recession and people are losing jobs. Give me a break!<br>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the original idea that immigrants would come to the U.S., Canada, Europe etc. receive their education and then go back and improve their country of origin?</p>
<p>How naive could we have possibly have been?</p>

		<p><i>Immigrants to Australia don&rsquo;t think speaking English is &ldquo;relevant.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Equivalent statements:</p>
<p>Job applicants don&rsquo;t think having applicable job experience is &#8220;relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suitor doesn&rsquo;t think target of his affection&rsquo;s lack of attraction to him is &#8220;relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Defendant doesn&rsquo;t think judge&rsquo;s ruling is &#8220;relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loan applicant doesn&rsquo;t think his creditworthiness is &#8220;relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Student doesn&rsquo;t think his failing final exam is &#8220;relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just figured I&rsquo;d put that in context.</p>

		<p>To get a degree is one thing, but obviously, if you want to live in a society that is new to you, you have to learn the language, et adequate social skills. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll end up with problems. It will be much harder to find a job - and keep it!</p>
