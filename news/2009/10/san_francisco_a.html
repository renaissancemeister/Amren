<h1>San Francisco Approves Law to Protect Illegal Juveniles</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors gave final approval Tuesday to a measure that would keep law enforcement from turning over minors to immigration authorities unless they have been found guilty of a felony.</p>
<p>The move pits the panel against Mayor Gavin Newsom and law enforcement by reversing his policy of turning over youths to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after their arrest.</p>
<p>Newsom took the stance in 2008 after the city was accused of protecting young offenders such as Edwin Ramos from deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the mayor changed the policy, 149 undocumented juveniles charged with felonies have been referred to immigration officials, ICE said.</p>
<p>The newly approved measure is supported by civil rights groups, immigrant advocates and the Juvenile Division of the Public Defender&rsquo;s Office, who contend it restores the right of minors to due process and gives them a chance to defend themselves before facing possible deportation and separation from their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those siding with the mayor  &mdash;  the police chief and district attorney, among others  &mdash;  argue the new ordinance will force officers to go against federal law by shielding undocumented immigrants and exposing the city to lawsuits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure must now go to Newsom, who has said he would veto it. Supervisors have said they would overturn his veto, a move likely to touch off a legal fight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is San Francisco&rsquo;s City of Refuge ordinance, adopted in 1989 as part of a national sanctuary movement intended to help refugees from Central American civil wars. Dozens of cities across the country adopted similar sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>The sanctuary policy allows officials who encounter undocumented immigrants not to report them to federal officials. It&rsquo;s credited with improving law enforcement relationships with the city&rsquo;s large immigrant community.</p>
<p>Adults who commit crimes are completely exempted from protection, but the situation of minors was unclear under the rule. Instead of turning juveniles suspects over to immigration officers, San Francisco was housing them or flying them back to their home countries at city expense.</p>

		<p>This sort of reminds me of a farmhouse situation. The hens in the liberal-minded henhouse are opposed to the big, bad farmer for his conservative ways and his slaughter of animals. The hens&rsquo; foolish liberalism leads them to view all animals as their natural allies, even those animals who are wild animals. The farmer hates wild animals, for the damage they do to his farm. The farmer, in his wise conservatism, knows that if he does not expel the wild animals, his farm will be no more!</p>
<p>But the hens are in defiance. A fox slinks into the farmyard and creeps into the henhouse. The redneck farmer comes running out of his house, his rifle cocked. But the hens barricade the door and peck at the farmer when he tries to point his gun at the fox.</p>
<p>Finally, exasperated, the farmer retreats back to his house. The hens cackle with glee, for they know they&rsquo;ve won. Now they settle back contentedly for the night, with their fox &#8216;ally&rsquo; safely within their abode.</p>
<p>OK, the fox is in the henhouse. You can all guess what will happen next. This is my &#8216;Animal Farm&rsquo; rendition of what San Francisco is doing to itself. Let&rsquo;s face it, illegal aliens, Muslims, third-worlders, et al, care NOTHING for traditional liberalism! They may vote for left-wing parties in order to score goodies, but they could care less about women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, environmental rights, civil rights, and all the other &#8216;rights&rsquo; that liberals in San Francisco claim to care so much about. These liberals will find out, just like the hens, what happens once they&rsquo;re outnumbered and/or let their guard down.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think it is wonderful that San Francisco is doing this.  Left-liberals are always talking about how wonderful diversity and soft-on-crime policies are, yet most of them live in homogeneous crime-free suburbs.  Now these left-liberals will get a taste of what they try to force on everyone else!</p>

		<p>I believe when the media began to phase out the use of &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; for the less &#8220;pejorative&#8221; phrase, &#8220;undocumented workers,&#8221; people should have known bureaucrats were positioning themselves for support of an illegal tsunami.  </p>

		<p>Probably what it would take to expose this liberal lunacy would be for another innocent person to be murdered by some illegal alien teenager, preferably one who was already shielded from the feds before, on a previous felony arrest. </p>

		<p>Amazing, considering the Hispanic gang rape activities going on across the bay in Richmond.  </p>
<p>It will only be a matter of time before the Latino population brings their own form of lawless depravity to San Francisco under the guise of civil rights.</p>
<p>Lawlessness and a contempt for justice go hand-in-hand.  If San Francisco officials refuse to protect their own citizens from lawless criminals, the people that elected them will get what they deserve.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for law abiding Americans to find a new home.  California in general, and San Francisco in particular, have little left for European white protestants.  </p>
<p>Is there any place left in America that a White protestant family can be proud to call home?</p>

		<p>San Francisco is a limousine liberal city.  At $600k on the low-end for a zero-lot line house, even the average middle-class white can&rsquo;t afford to live there.  Besides the tenderloin district which has gentrification around it and some other areas, they know that no illegals will ever be able to afford living there.  The statement &#8220;not in my backyard&#8221; never rang so true and the limousine liberals know this.  </p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t have that! I say DEPORT all of them, keeping families together and solving both problems at once. I believe statistics would show that most serious crimes are being committed by these very same YUFFS who KNOW they can get away with it. San Francisco, CALL-A-FOREIGNER.</p>

		<p>Very good analogy, Matt.   Your fable of the farmer and the hens is very apt.  The same society that those silly hens resent and which they squawk and flutter at is exactly the society that sustains them and protects their freedom to squawk and flap and flutter.</p>
<p>Without the farmer&rsquo;s food and protection, they wouldn&rsquo;t have the luxury to flap and flutter. They have come to take their comfort and security entirely too much for granted.</p>
<p>Not everything that is &#8220;other&#8221; is automatically good.  Not every &#8220;other&#8221; whom they take under their wing is necessarily a friend who will appreciate them and protect them.  Many of those &#8220;others&#8221; would gladly devour them in a second, if only they could, given half a chance.</p>
<p>Moral: Be careful whom you make friends with. Be careful whom you protect! They might not appreciate it or return the favor.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Exactly right.  We are told that we are in a recession. Oh? Really?  San Fran doesn&rsquo;t seem to know it.  When you visit there, everything costs a fortune, and the locals can afford it.  The place is swimming in money.</p>
<p>I swear, and I mean it, that things will have to get much, MUCH worse, before some of these people start hurting. They don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a recession going on, and they couldn&rsquo;t care less. Only when spoiled people like these feel the pinch will there be any hope of change.  </p>
<p>Until then, they don&rsquo;t see what your problem is.  Worrying about jobs and money and such nonsense! Trying to keep &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; from getting a decent job!  You&rsquo;re just a red-neck, trailer-trash bigot, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see them start to worry about jobs and money and such nonsense.  Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait!  But that&rsquo;s still a long way off.<br>

		<p>Frisco shall reap what it has sown. It is a small, geographically isolatated town. The smug, self-righteous libs will be the first victims of their beloved diversity. </p>
<p>There just ain&rsquo;t much room to hide with only 49 square miles surrounded on three sides by ocean.  </p>

<p>I agree.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure that it was White liberals who Attorney General E.Holder was referring to when he made the infamous &#8216;Nation of Cowards&rsquo; slur/speech.<br>
They have conservative patriotic Whites defend their freedom and way of life.<br>
Who they repay by attacking their beliefs, homeland and values with their multicultural &#8216;shock troops&rsquo;(borrowed phrase.)<br>
And the only time they show any backbone is to ferociously attack their own racial family (in support of the aliens.)  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for all of us, they will get the world that they are fighting for.</p>
