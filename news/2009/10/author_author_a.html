<h1>Author, Author: A Sorry Denouement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel J. Kelley, Chicago Daily Observer, October 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Imagine a man whose entire public career is predicated upon a simple yet colossal fraud.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several months ago, I wrote an article that raised questions related to Barack Obama&rsquo;s celebrated autobiography, &#8220;Dreams from My Father.&#8221; I found portions of the book to be preposterous and difficult to accept as truthful. I thought some episodes in the book were completely fabricated. Other events were conflated. To be fair, it was not a particularly original article. Many other columnists found fault with the book and serious questions were raised as to the authenticity of Obama&rsquo;s literary skills.</p>
<p>It was suggested in many quarters that Bill Ayers was the actual author of the book rather than Obama. Jack Cashill wrote a series of online articles which compared and contrasted paragraphs in Obama&rsquo;s bestseller with similar passages found in books written by Ayers. Subsequent denials by Ayers did nothing to dispel the credible rumors concerning the origins of the book. The duplicitous Ayers has steadfastly denied collaborating with Obama on the book. Obama, himself, dismissed the extent of his association with Ayres, a former domestic terrorist, who he described simply as &#8220;a guy who lives in my neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newly published &#8220;Barack and Michelle: A Portrait of an American Marriage&#8221; by Christopher Andersen adds more fuel to the fire. After interviewing close to two hundred persons, Andersen states that Obama had lost one publishing contract for his long delayed autobiography and he struggled to meet a second publisher&rsquo;s deadline when he hurriedly turned over his work materials to Ayers. Obama had already spent close to half of his initial advance and he did not have anything resembling a final manuscript. Michelle Obama reportedly recommended that Ayers be called upon to collaborate with her husband on the book. The finished text suggests that Obama did little or no actual writing. The form and content of the book is unlike any other of the writings that Obama has made public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suspiciously, Obama&rsquo;s student records and scholarly writings from Occidental, Columbia and Harvard have been scrupulously guarded and withheld from researchers and the public. In light of recent revelations, one wonders if Obama was not acting out of motives related to personal modesty or privacy concerns. It seems as if his handlers were seeking to safeguard their candidate from being exposed as a phony. One wonders if Ayers and members of his radical cadre were not delighted to assist in launching a &#8220;Manchurian Candidate&#8221; upon a gullible and naïve American electorate.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that the truth has finally become public. Obama is not the first politician to profit from a successful book while relying upon the help of others to produce his manuscripts. Some politicians have had the honesty to list their co-authors or published books with the descriptive &#8220;as told to&#8221; appellation, but Obama seems to have largely faked it from start to finish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama is a calculating and scheming opportunist, as his past political history has demonstrated from the time of his first election to the Illinois State Senate. Like many of David Axelrod&rsquo;s political clients, he has shown willingness to bend the truth and lie whenever it is expedient to do so. Somehow, I doubt he will be greatly embarrassed by the latest expose. He has no sense of shame. Like Kennedy, Obama can depend upon an adoring media to bury his misdeeds for as long as possible.<br>

		<p>A lot of Barack Obama&rsquo;s life seems to be swept under the rug.  For instance, we&rsquo;re supposed to think that he&rsquo;s some magnificent force, and a great ambassador for Chicago&rsquo;s black community and Chicago as a whole.  </p>
<p>The inconvenient truth of the matter is that as late as nine years ago, he wasn&rsquo;t even welcome at his own party&rsquo;s national convention, and was at that time still considered an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and &#8220;interloper&#8221; by the real engines of Chicago&rsquo;s black political machine as he tried to take on Bobby Rush for the U.S. House.</p>

		<p>Anyone with a modicum of intelligence can see Obama is a puppet, a front man, for dangerous interests. Interests dangerous to whites and the US as a &#8220;white&#8221; nation. I never thought Obama had written anything credited to him, at all. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt a lot of his schoolwork was taken care of by various handlers. After all, look his background. We have a mediocre student plucked out seemingly nowhere (Occidental College), dropped into prestigious schools (Columbia and Harvard) and smoothly rolling into political office. Take a look at the &#8220;team&#8221; around Obama. That&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s running things. And they&rsquo;re getting their marching orders from bigger fish. </p>

<p>Year one of the four-year-long Halloween is almost over, and the disguise of this man  &mdash;   be it intellectual Greek orator, middle-of-the-road populist, or the last-of-the-Kennedys   &mdash;   is being shown to be shoddy, cheap, and poorly-made.</p>
<p>Do we dare to rip off the entire fabricated Halloween disguise?</p>
<p>Are we more afraid of the reality, than the illusion? </p>
<p>I think so, but we are in for a sober awakening.</p>
<p>We will be haunted by the spectre of this man, and our foolishness in electing him, for a long time.</p>
<p>And the press will keep telling us that what we see just ain&rsquo;t so, but we know it is.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t there computer programs that analyze a text for consistency of style and other factors? Such programs are said to have determined that books of the Bible were not written by their purported authors. Why not run Obama&rsquo;s autobiography through there and then compare it to Ayers&rsquo; known writings? Obama can keep his writings from Occidental, Columbia and Harvard a secret all he wants; that would not prevent  a comparison of his book with Ayers&rsquo; writings. Obama&rsquo;s school papers are no doubt kept secret because he had someone write them for him, something that a pampered black figurehead would no doubt have no trouble arranging.</p>

		<p>Very Cynical #4, I&rsquo;ve been saying exactly the same thing about Obama being a puppet for some very rich, very dangerous puppeteers. And I don&rsquo;t believe for a moment it&rsquo;s Americans pulling the strings.</p>
<p>Plagarism and ghost writing are the norm for celebrities, politicians and anyone else writing an autobiography - it isn&rsquo;t at all unusual that the big O had virtually nothing to do with this book other than some quotes. But what is unsettling is the secrecy surrounding this worshipped puppet. We don&rsquo;t know a whole lot more than we do know.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered if one had access to those brought in contact with President Obama during his life  &mdash;  students in classes he took; neighbors; his own extended family networks;<br>
elective social groups he was in for even occasional times; etc etc., whether one would find that lots of such people have had badges flashed in their faces in recent years regarding their knowledge.  Up to a point, that would not be improper if done correctly.  But if done to a point of intimidation, surely it would  be improper. There seem to be  too few people giving information about his background.     </p>

		<p>Re Tim in Indiana and computer programs that analyze text.  <br>
Interesting point.  They also analyze text even if the author is not in doubt in that programs can yield quite a bit in the way of<br>
pretty reliable extrapolation about aspects of the author&rsquo;s personality.  Beyond this, we have the &#8220;psychological profiling&#8221; of organizations like the FBI&rsquo;s Behavioral Sciences Section.  There ought to be ways of biographers first feeding hordes of dry old facts or likely facts into a profile program in order to supplement old fashioned ways of shaping their search for &#8220;the real&#8221; President Obama.   </p>

		<p>Re Tim in Indiana  &mdash;  #7<br>
Good observation.  Computer programs also exist to look deeper<br>
into the personality of an author by analyzing his text for that purpose.  Beyond this, are programs of psychological profiling that often enough can take a few facts and extrapolate a lot of likely information  &mdash;  likely to be corroborated by subsequent fact finding.  I have never heard of a single use of psychological profiling programs by biographers writing about President Obama.<br>
Or any analysis online openly in discussion among those who can use such technology.  </p>

		<p>I think Obama&rsquo;s scholarly writings are kept secret for more insidious reasons than plagiarism and others writing these documents. I believe these documents would prove that he is not only a hard core Communist, but he also hates Whites, and has a deep desire to redistribute ALL of White man&rsquo;s wealth to minorities at ANY cost. I believe his college documents prove him a Communist, which would have kept him from being voted in as President; never mind the fact that he is not a natural born citizen, if he is even a citizen at all. </p>
<p>Remember, this black man went to school in Indonesia; a country that did NOT allow dual citizenship for students out of country. This meant he would have been required to renounce his US citizenship during those school years. Then he would have been required to reapply for US citizenship, which he never did. This means he is not only not natural born, but he is also an illegal alien.</p>

		<p>The dead giveaway would be to analyze the book for introspection. Introspection is not part of the black psychology. Even what is passed off as black literary achievement is just shallow finger pointing at others dressed up in big words found in the thesaurus. This incapacity for introspection explains in large part report after report of blacks going to parties, sleeping in, chilling as if nothing is wrong after they commit rapes, robberies and murders. That is why there is no black Dostoevsky and no black Crime and Punishment. Instrospection and conscience are completely alien to them.</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that a man who never published a single article, either as a &#8220;brilliant&#8221; student or as a law professor, could turn around and write a book like &#8220;Dreams From My Father.&#8221; I have read many other places that the book&rsquo;s style is undeniably that of Bill Ayers, complete with numerous nautical references, which are one of his trademarks.<br>
However, this is completely irrelevant.  The media will never cover it and his supporters won&rsquo;t care.  We need to realize that a significant portion of the white population is hopelessly brainwashed.  Unfortuantely, this is especially true of young people.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with the previous comment (#3 above) inasmuch as Obama&rsquo;s career advanced due to his associations with people like Ayers and his not too covert ally, Daley. In the black community, he was viewed with suspicion as an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; character and Congressman Bobby Rush was able to beat him to a pulp pointing up his lack of accomplishments and the fact that he had no ties to Chicago&rsquo;s black political community. Obama&rsquo;s handlers pressed him to start talking &#8220;ghetto&#8221; in speeches and he began associating with Reverend Wright to gain some &#8220;street credibility.&#8221; Ditto his boasting about drug use. </p>
<p>Obama was a lazy, do nothing member of the state legislature, he never served long enough in the US Senate to make an impression (he gained both offices by trashing his opponents by leaking divorce court pleadings   &mdash;   not surprisingly his own records have been buried). He is probably the worst president in terms of preparation for the office. </p>

		<p>Genes need not be destiny.  We have the freedom to confront the implications of the personality traits and abilities that lie in our ancestry and  thus to  make our informed choices and define ourselves based upon such insight and probablities.  From what we know about the heritablity of traits, the biographical information about the President&rsquo;s Kenyan father and about his Kansas mother is meagre.     <br>

Very Cynical, Occidental College is not &ldquo;nowhere&rdquo;. It was established over a century ago as a western equivalent to the many fine, small, eastern liberal arts colleges. If it is a pit of leftism today, it is no more so than Dartmouth or Cornell. It used to be one of the things that made SoCal the White Arcadia.</b></p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing my point. We have a mediocre black (mulatto) student who most likely wasn&rsquo;t qualified to go to Oxy (I lived in Eagle Rock for awhile, and friends went to Occidental, I&rsquo;m very familiar with the school). It&rsquo;s amazing how far the people in charge will go to find and mold their tools. There are indeed conspiracies and collusion of all types in many areas. </p>
<p>Obama was found, somehow, seen as a perfect tool and recruited in a fashion. He&rsquo;s so dense in some ways I&rsquo;m sure he believes most of his success is due to seeing unearthly abilities in himself. </p>
<p>On a side note, it&rsquo;s sad what&rsquo;s happened to the area around Occidental College. The entire neighborhood has fallen victim to immigration / diversity. Much of Eagle Rock and the surrounding areas are stuffed with Mexicans who seem to have no pride in maintaining property but do take pride in gang warfare and the like. People around the country who aren&rsquo;t aware or who sneer, thinking it&rsquo;s the fault of the white residents should take note. It&rsquo;s coming to their front doors, and Obama&rsquo;s handlers are trying to step up the pace. </p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone with a modicum of intelligence can see Obama is a puppet, a front man, for dangerous interests. Interests dangerous to whites and the US as a &ldquo;white&rdquo; nation. I never thought Obama had written anything credited to him, at all. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt a lot of his schoolwork was taken care of by various handlers. After all, look his background. We have a mediocre student plucked out seemingly nowhere (Occidental College), dropped into prestigious schools (Columbia and Harvard) and smoothly rolling into political office. Take a look at the &ldquo;team&rdquo; around Obama. That&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s running things. And they&rsquo;re getting their marching orders from bigger fish. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; Bigger Fish = George Soros</p>
<p>&gt; If one takes the time to think back to the 2004 election and politics before then, George Soros&rsquo; name, money and influence was very prominent.  It was possible to find commentary by him online and in major publications.  He made it no secret that he had definite ideas on where he wanted to use his wealth and influence in America.  In the 2004 election, he became a problem, because his money and plans were far too public.  The Dems were criticized over his obvious undemocratic influence in the election and in general.  During Obama&rsquo;s campaign, Soros took a completely opposite strategy; he became a shadow and very difficult to detect, but he was there - big time.  It is my opinion, as we witness the progression of this administration, and Soros continues to remain out of the MSM&rsquo;s eye or at least reports, that he is very much a force behind the entire facade of the Obama Administration.  AT least for me, he gets my vote as the man behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Anyone have a better candidate?<br>

<p>No, this is a common error.  Obama&rsquo;s magic isn&rsquo;t down to Obama, it&rsquo;s down to the media.  The media could take away his mojo in a heartbeat, and his fans would lose faith.</p>
<p>His fans are in love with the pass Obama gets from the media, allowing them to take a break from the nihilism/ennui/irony/tragic-hipsterism/sarcasm/cynicism they&rsquo;re bombarded with 24/7/365.</p>

<p>Soros is the main poisoner of America.  He&rsquo;s behind almost every far left organization in the country today:  Moveon.org; the Daily Kos; and some say the Huffington Post, although she has considerable money herself.  I&rsquo;m guessing that he is also the big investor behind those Michael Moore debacles, plus many other groups and events.  He was the money man behind Van Jones&rsquo;s Marxist Revolutionary STORM in San Francisco, also.  Find a leftist nitwit or weasel and chances are gorgeous George is propping him up with money.  </p>
<p>Maurice Strong is behind a lot of it all also, but not as much as Soros.  I&rsquo;m not sure Strong is alive today either, because it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve heard of one of his hare-brained schemes. </p>
<p>Soros himself must be about 80 now, or close to it, so I&rsquo;m wondering why he&rsquo;s so concerned about trying to upset Western societies, since he probably hasn&rsquo;t too much time left to see anything he wants reach completion.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is usually the most often correct: He&rsquo;s a screwball liberal that probably has reasons for doing what he does that none of us would consider sane and logical.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if his last few years are filled with watching all his efforts and money destroyed via a takeover by the social conservative elements in both Europe and the US.</p>
<p>The way things are going now, for the first time in ten years, I believe it&rsquo;s a very real possibility.</p>

<p>Only good speakers/orators can truly change history&hellip;the best thing writers can hope to do is influence the ideas of great oratorical politicians who in turn use that knowledge to influence the masses.</p>

		<p>In today&rsquo;s news, there was weeping, tears and gasps that the Obama magic &#8220;A-Team&#8221; (as Je$$e Jack$son called them) was not able to secure Chicago as the site of the 2016 Olympics.  Why were these people so distraught?  The media would have us believe it was because of the prestige that comes from the host city and the boost to the economy.  I have entirely ideas.</p>
<p>I believe that people were distraught due to the fact that they have been told for the last 2 years that Barrack Obama is the new messiah and that he can accomplish anything - that he CANNOT FAIL AT ANYTHING.  Of course, it was pretty stupid to go to Copenhagen and beg for Chicago to be chosen as the host city, when just a few days before the Obamas (traveling separately at taxpayer expense) that the news media aired shocking video of a honor student, coming home from school, being beaten to death with 2x4&rsquo;s.  Some safe city.</p>
<p>But all those people weeping and gasping over Obama&rsquo;s failure will soon be spouting that the failure of the IOC to chose Chicago was nothing more than pure and simple racism.  Anybody willing to take bets on it?</p>

		<p>People are right. Obama is a puppet of the NWO, hate the West and whites crowd. He&rsquo;s most likely not really a muslim or they&rsquo;d have picked a different puppet. The IOC not picking Chicago was probably a conscious spit in the face to the NWO crowd as many within the IOC are tired of the NWO folks and their ilk actually controlling various sporting bodies, in many cases now being very selective in drug testing for example to be sure to never catch (guilty parties) from certain countries and groups in order to achieve the &#8220;proper&#8221; results on the podium - either for social &#8220;conditioning&#8221; or to simply make money. Or our real masters simply have officials enforce rules selectively to do the same (just think about the US / NBA team in Beijing being babied by officials after years of fair officiating showing the NBA players to be overrated, flashy frauds who couldn&rsquo;t shoot the ball). Just a small example of what these people are up to and it shows how they have decided to stick their fingers in everything, seeking to destroy it all while covering it up as some kind of beneficial work that is really only done to change the world in a good way. Look at far they&rsquo;ve gone in the US since the 60&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s evidence of a hate crime against whites on a massive scale I&rsquo;d say. Obama is merely in place so his controllers can sit back and laugh at whites. </p>

Like Kennedy, Obama can depend upon an adoring media to bury his misdeeds for as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is the big surprise here?</p>
<p>These Multi Cult idiots in the media have not only buried his &ldquo;misdeeds,&rdquo; but they openly campaigned for the feckless wretch while he was running for the presidency. Moreover, they fuel an endlessly chugging propaganda distillery, that produces an ocean of 200 proof Obagasmic rotgut intended to intoxicate the pubic and have them comatosely believe that his presidency is an unprecedented success. Every failure, like the recent &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of the secret Iranian uranium enrichment facility and his debacle in attempting to get the Olympic Games held in Chicago, is bizarrely portrayed as being part of some master plan by the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; to move us toward Nirvana. If it wasn&rsquo;t so blatantly pathetic, it would be hideously laughable. </p>

<p>In fact, the student from Kenya who dated his mother, went back to Kenya pretty much right after Barack&rsquo;s birth&hellip; Then Barack lived for a few years in Indonesia, where his muslim stepfather enrolled him in a muslim school. After his mother,s passing away, Barack came back to the States and lived with his grand-parents in Hawai.</p>

		<p>alex haley&rsquo;s &#8220;roots&#8221; series did more to misinform and perpetuate lies than any one else until now.  He failed to reveal that slave-hunters were conquering &#8220;tribes&#8221; and that although abhorrent by today&rsquo;s standards, slavery was considered part of the &#8220;human condition&#8221; in those times.  A black author named Ben Richburg went to africa to find his &#8220;roots&#8221;.  When he got there, other blacks attempted to recruit him into their tribal warfare.  He then realized (as he wrote in his book) that his ancestors were fortunate to have been brought into America, even as slaves.  <br>
Our &#8220;half-blood-prince&#8221; obama will not reveal his birth certificate, college records and other critical information.<br>
Facts:  he was born in kenya-this does not automatically exclude him from being considered &#8220;native-born&#8221;, but does raise questions, him being registered as a &#8220;citizen of kenya&#8221; as a muslim.<br>
His school records are sealed-possible low scores and plagiarism.<br>
He traveled on a indonesian passport during his school years.<br>
He received &#8220;scholarships&#8221; that were only for FOREIGN students.<br>
His travel expenses far exceeded his means.  Where did the &#8220;funds&#8221; come from?  Who were his benefactors?<br>
His &#8220;gaffes&#8221; (which were overlooked by our &#8220;mainstream media&#8221;) were NOT &#8220;gaffes&#8221; at all.  His &#8220;57 states&#8221; comment and his &#8220;siding with muslims&#8221; comment as well as his perfect recitation of the muslim &#8220;call to prayer&#8221; were proof of his disingenuous character.<br>
The only thing that obama can be given credit for is his promise to &#8220;change&#8221; the United States.  He is keeping his word by steering this country towards communism and muslim &#8220;sharia law&#8221;.<br>
Those people who think &#8220;associations don&rsquo;t matter&#8221; have it all wrong.  Look at obama&rsquo;s associations  &mdash;  communists, racists, criminals.<br>

roles:  Mr. Soweto, his stepfather; Stan Dunham, his maternal grandfather.  It seems unconvincing that young Obama would be as  distant from Stan Dunham (&#8220;Gramps&#8221;) as the autobiographical writing suggests he was. Several people are quoted to the effect that Stan Dunham loved his grandson very deeply and they spent a lot of time happily together .   Obviously, there are political complexities for a Black candidate who affirms he was especially close to his White grandfather.  Was he? </p>

		<p>One of the thing lib trolls seem to parrot over and over again why we should almost idolize the person of Barack H. Obama II is that he was the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review.</p>
<p>Once you scratch the surface, you find out that Obama leaned away from any radical propensities he had, in fact, this was before he hooked up with Jeremiah &#8220;GD America&#8221; Wright, Bill Ayers, Bern Dohrn, Rahmbo and Axelrod, and couched his rhetoric in enough sugar such that conservative Harvard Law School student were suckered by his act.  They supported Obama as a consensus candidate over and above more outspoken radicals and extremists, and their votes plus the black votes put Obama over the top.</p>
