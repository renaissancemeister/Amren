			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Greenhill, Daily Mail (London), October 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Disgraced millionaire footballer Marlon King will be signed by another club when his jail sentence is finished, his agent insisted today.</p>
<p>The player was sacked by Wigan yesterday after being jailed for 18 months for groping a woman and then smashing her in the face after she rejected him.</p>
<p>But today his agent Tony Finnigan said that prison would change King for the better and that he would have good career prospects on release.</p>
<p>Mr Finnigan said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t want to name names but there are lots of players in this country who have fallen short of the law, done the crime, done the time, come out, and I&rsquo;m sure if you&rsquo;re sitting in a six by six you do have time to reflect on the change you make as a person in your life.</p>
<p>&#8216;Forget about playing football here, just as a human being you&rsquo;re going to be different.</p>
<p>&#8216;He still will be a good goalscorer and I&rsquo;m sure someone will want his signature to play football and do the job that he&rsquo;s best at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Today it emerged that King has 13 previous convictions including theft, assaulting a police officer and wounding.</p>
<p>In a criminal career that ran parallel to his sporting one, the 29-year-old was given a succession of fines and community service orders  &mdash;  but only once was he actually jailed.</p>
<p>Yesterday he lost both his liberty and his job as a soccer player after a Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sexual assault by touching.</p>
<p>Within minutes of the verdict, he was sacked by his club Wigan Athletic.</p>
<p>Chairman Dave Whelan, who said he learned details of the trial only days ago, said: &#8216;He is absolutely sacked.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will not tolerate football players who get sent to jail for 18 months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the £40,000-a-week star will still earn earn another £228,000 from behind bars during a 40-day notice period.</p>
<p>King is now a convicted sex attacker who must sign the Sex Offenders Register.</p>
<p>That means that if the Jamaican international ever returned to football in Britain he would have to notify police of any intention to travel abroad for matches.</p>
<p>King had been on a boozy night out with friends in December last year to celebrate news that his wife was expecting their third child and to mark scoring a winning goal for Hull City, where he was on loan.</p>
<p>Just two days earlier he had been banned from driving for eight weeks after speeding at 106mph on a 60mph road.</p>
<p>Onlookers said he appeared to be drunk or on drugs as he tried to force his attentions on girls in the Soho Revue Bar in London&rsquo;s West End.</p>
<p>When a 20-year- old student objected to him touching her bottom, King sneered: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t you know who I am? I&rsquo;m a millionaire.</p>
<p>&#8216;You&rsquo;re not even in my league.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Minutes later, after the slightly-built woman tried to stop him touching her hair, he swung his fist and knocked her to the ground, breaking her nose.</p>
<p>The blow was so hard that two of her friends were knocked to the floor with her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the jury brought in 10-2 guilty verdicts, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told King to pay his victim £3,125 compensation and £1,600 prosecution costs.</p>
<p>The player showed no reaction as he was convicted but sat open-mouthed as the judge told him: &#8216;You have shown not a hint of shame for your disgraceful and arrogant behaviour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As King&rsquo;s victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat holding the hand of an aunt, the judge continued: &#8216;You broke her nose, and that can still be seen, and you cut her lip.</p>
<p>&#8216;You are 29, you are just over six feet and you are a professional footballer.</p>
<p>&#8216;She is a comparatively slight woman, just over five feet tall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the sentence was delivered, several of King&rsquo;s supporters stormed from court, swearing at the judge.</p>
<p>One screamed: &#8216;This is a clear case of institutional racism.</p>
<p>&#8216;You should not be up there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Up the National Front. Heil Hitler.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this would apply to the UK, but various high level professional leagues in the US have gotten exemptions from the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have a real league.  I would make a condition of the SATA exemption that those convicted of serious felonies shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to play in the league.  (Yes, I&rsquo;m thinking about Leonard Little.)</p>

		<p>Finnigan believes his client has been the victim of mistaken identity  &mdash;  his defence in court  &mdash;  and is confident his career is not over. </p>
<p>But the £40,000-a-week star will still earn earn another £228,000 from behind bars during a 40-day notice period.</p>

<p>Given all her pain and trouble, and considering the amount of money that he will continue to earn   &mdash;   EVEN BEHIND BARS(!)   &mdash;    that compensation he must pay her is disgracefully meager. Just a drop in the bucket to him.   Mere pocket change. Disgusting!</p>
<p>Oh, and are we to believe that string of other crimes were all cases of &#8220;mistaken identity&#8221; too?</p>

		<p>I almost can&rsquo;t believe that some people have yelled at the judge, who was simply doint his job, calling him a racist!</p>
<p>What did such people expect? That that King character would just be able to go on with his life, as if he had never done anything wrong?</p>

<p>The usual ban is two years plus revocation of the driving licence, which can only be rescinded with evidence of treatment for alcohol addiction and an additional driving test.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m astonished that this behavior would be countenanced in England! So they have fallen this far.</p>
<p>And to think that up until just a couple of decades ago, life in England was known for its graciousness and civility.  No longer.</p>

		<p>So if a black man commits a violent assault it is now &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; to try and convict him.  Since there is nothing wrong with convicting criminals there is nothing wrong with institutional racism.  I&rsquo;m glad we have that settled.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to Niagra Falls, Canada, but I remember from a few decades ago, friends and family used to come back from their trips to Toronto and Montreal carrying on about how &#8216;clean&rsquo; everything was. I wasn&rsquo;t a &#8216;racialist&rsquo;, back then, or even a disaffected white, so I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t think they were trying to be racial or racist about it. </p>

<p>To be an international player, by FIFA&rsquo;s rules, you dont necesarily have to be a citizen of the country you play for.  You can have as tenuous a connection as having one Jamaican grandparent,for example, even though you may have been born, educated and raised in England.  So, unfortunately, he may well be a British cirtizen, and we&rsquo;re stuck with him.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Are you saying, therefore, that you MUST have &#8220;a tenuous connection&#8221; of some sort, otherwise you can&rsquo;t play?</p>
<p>Are we to understand that ALL these Africans (and others) whom we see paying on European teams, have some sort of &#8220;tenuous connection&#8221; to those countries?  </p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me what a lot of white sports fans will allow others to endure over a game of ball. I think some get their (I am not a racist goodie points this way).<br>
White males that live to watch others of any race play sports are the most pathetic of men. I enjoy a good basketball or football game sometimes( I have watched 2 on TV and attended a third this whole season).  But, how pathetic to spend your waking hours listening to sports radio and worrying about a game played by a bunch of thugs. My God they do not want to play&hellip;just watch others..waste of life.  <br>

<p>That small amount to be paid, especially for someone so rich, is pathetic.</p>
<p>But furthermore, I have to wonder if that judge is a West Indian. The name sounds suspiciously West Indian to me. I&rsquo;d love to know.</p>
<p>Was it one Jamaican sitting in judgement on another Jamaican?</p>
