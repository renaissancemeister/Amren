<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/finance/20091008/US.FEA.Lifestyles.Black.Barbies/">Mattel Introduces Black Barbies, to Mixed Reviews</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan K. Scott, Comcast News, October 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mattel has launched a new line of black Barbie dolls with fuller lips, a wider nose and more pronounced cheek bones  &mdash;  a far cry from Christie, Barbie&rsquo;s black friend who debuted in the 1960s and was essentially a white doll painted brown.</p>
<p>The &#8220;So In Style&#8221; line, which hit mass retailers last month, features BFFs Grace, Kara and Trichelle, each with her own style and interests and a little sister she mentors: Courtney, Janessa and Kianna. The dolls reflect varying skin tones  &mdash;  light brown, chocolate, and caramel  &mdash;  and Trichelle and Kianna have curlier hair.</p>
<p>Barbie designer Stacey McBride-Irby, who is black and has a 6-year-old daughter, said she wanted to create a line of dolls for young black girls that looked like them and were inspirational and career-minded. For example, Kara is interested in math and music.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many black women are praising Mattel for its efforts  &mdash;  Black Barbie hit the shelves in 1980 with white features shared by many of the dolls following her.</p>
<p>But some say the long straight hair does not address the beauty issues that many black girls struggle with. In the black community, long, straight hair is often considered more beautiful than short kinky hair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are we always pushing this standard of long hair on our girls?&#8221; asked Gail Parrish, 60, a playwright in Alexandria, Va., and a mother of four grown children. &#8220;Why couldn&rsquo;t one of the dolls have a little short afro, or shorter braids or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>McBride-Irby said she originally designed all the dolls with long hair. Combing her Barbie&rsquo;s long hair when she was a girl was the &#8220;highlight of my play experience,&#8221; she said. She was advised to create some dolls with curlier hair, so she did.</p>
<p>There is a So In Style hairstyling set so girls can curl, straighten and style their dolls&rsquo; hair over and over. (It costs $24.99, more than a pair of dolls at $19.99.)</p>
<p>That is troubling to Sheri Parks, an associate professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland in College Park, because it actively involves girls in the process of straightening hair. She worries that it reinforces the message that there is something wrong with natural hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black mothers who want their girls to love their natural hair have an uphill battle and these dolls could make it harder,&#8221; Parks said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Aside from the hair, some black women are concerned about the dolls&rsquo; thin frames. Barbie, which celebrated her 50th birthday in March, has for years come under fire for promoting an unrealistic body image, with her long legs, tiny waist and large breasts.</p>
<p>While white girls also deal with body-image issues, Kumea Shorter-Gooden, co-author of &#8220;Shifting: The Double Lives of Black Women in America,&#8221; believes Barbie has a more negative impact on black girls. They are already struggling with messages that &#8220;black skin isn&rsquo;t pretty and our hair is too kinky and short,&#8221; she said.</p>

If they make them more racially identifiable as black, they will be seen as stereotypes and racist caricatures.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win. You can&rsquo;t even break even.</p>

		<p>Has it ever occurred to a black business person to manufacture a doll that pleases black children? Why depend on whites? Instead of a black duplicate of Barbie, have a doll that truly resembles black children. Make her hair, her skin and her features black. Don&rsquo;t always rely on whites. Do you own thing. We&rsquo;ll continue to manufacture Barbie like we want and you can manufacture the doll that you want. See, it&rsquo;s easy to decided rather than whining about what whites do.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t look anything like a Barbie doll and yet I wasn&rsquo;t given a choice when I was growing up. How about a Barbie that little white girls can relate to? Geez, it&rsquo;s always got to be about black women, black struggles, blah, blah. No one cares about little white kids who don&rsquo;t &#8220;relate&#8221; to the perfect Barbie.</p>

		<p><i> They are already struggling with messages that &ldquo;black skin isn&rsquo;t pretty and our hair is too kinky and short,&rdquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Notice the implied conspiracy theory here, but maybe the &#8220;messages&#8221; are coming from their own eyes&hellip;?</p>
<p>When blacks in Africa put rings through their noses and dinner plates through their lips, nobody asks why they are not happy with their normal body appearance. It is accepted as something that they have chosen to do, or it is even celebrated. But because blacks have chosen to live in white society, anything they do that seems to mimic whites is a cause for great hand-wringing and guilt-mongering. </p>
<p>The hand-wringing is bad enough, but trying to put a guilt trip on others for  their own personal choices is unforgivable.</p>

Watching my daughter play 20 years ago, she would cut and style the hair of her Barbie.  Apparently in Ms. Parrish&rsquo;s haste to criticize, she didn&rsquo;t consider it easier to cut and style a dolls long hair, then wait for that doll with short hair to have it grow out.</p>

		<p>Yes, have the manufacturer make several kinds of black Barbies.  Progressively darker skin, broader lips, flatter noses, whatever the ethnic PC police desire to express diversity.  Then let the public vote, in the form of doll purchases, indicating which level of blackness they like best.  Be careful what you wish for.</p>

		<p>You just can&rsquo;t with with the multiculturalism crowd. If blacks weren&rsquo;t included, it&rsquo;s racism.  Then once they are included, the multiculturalism people then complain we&rsquo;re stereotyping.  Damned if you do. Damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I think it should be MANDATORY for all little White girls to have at least one such Black &#8220;barbie&#8221; doll in her collection. </p>
<p>Seriously&hellip; How utterly goofy can this p.o. nonsense get? That is, before Americans wise up and tell the &#8220;experts&#8221; and sociologists where to stuff political correctness? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for the day it becomes a federal offense for any White family to not have a Black family as their &#8220;best friends&#8221;&hellip; like is invariably portrayed in those ridiculous sit-com commercials peddling every imaginable product or service on the TV channels. I admit to NOT having Blacks as friends. Nor do I have even the slightest inclination to change. But then why in hell should I. Despite the p.c. garbage pumped at us from childhood on, I PICK my friends on the basis of congeniality and being the kind of people I and my family are.</p>
