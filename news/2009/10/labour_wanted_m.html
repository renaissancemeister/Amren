<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The huge increases in migrants over the last decade were partly due to a politically motivated attempt by ministers to radically change the country and &#8220;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&#8221;, according to Andrew Neather, a former adviser to Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett.</p>
<p>He said Labour&rsquo;s relaxation of controls was a deliberate plan to &#8220;open up the UK to mass migration&#8221; but that ministers were nervous and reluctant to discuss such a move publicly for fear it would alienate its &#8220;core working class vote&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a result, the public argument for immigration concentrated instead on the economic benefits and need for more migrants.</p>
<p>Critics said the revelations showed a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; within Government to impose mass immigration for &#8220;cynical&#8221; political reasons.</p>
<p>Mr Neather was a speech writer who worked in Downing Street for Tony Blair and in the Home Office for Jack Straw and David Blunkett, in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Writing in the Evening Standard, he revealed the &#8220;major shift&#8221; in immigration policy came after the publication of a policy paper from the Performance and Innovation Unit, a Downing Street think tank based in the Cabinet Office, in 2001.</p>
<p>He wrote a major speech for Barbara Roche, the then immigration minister, in 2000, which was largely based on drafts of the report.</p>
<p>He said the final published version of the report promoted the labour market case for immigration but unpublished versions contained additional reasons, he said.</p>
<p>He wrote: &#8220;Earlier drafts I saw also included a driving political purpose: that mass immigration was the way that the Government was going to make the UK truly multicultural.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended  &mdash;  even if this wasn&rsquo;t its main purpose  &mdash;  to rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;deliberate policy&#8221;, from late 2000 until &#8220;at least February last year&#8221;, when the new points based system was introduced, was to open up the UK to mass migration, he said.</p>
<p>Some 2.3 million migrants have been added to the population since then, according to Whitehall estimates quietly slipped out last month.</p>
<p>On Question Time on Thursday, Mr Straw was repeatedly quizzed about whether Labour&rsquo;s immigration policies had left the door open for the BNP.</p>
<p>In his column, Mr Neather said that as well as bringing in hundreds of thousands more migrants to plug labour market gaps, there was also a &#8220;driving political purpose&#8221; behind immigration policy.</p>
<p>He defended the policy, saying mass immigration has &#8220;enriched&#8221; Britain, and made London a more attractive and cosmopolitan place.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that &#8220;nervous&#8221; ministers made no mention of the policy at the time for fear of alienating Labour voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part by accident, part by design, the Government had created its longed-for immigration boom.</p>
<p>&#8220;But ministers wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it. In part they probably realised the conservatism of their core voters: while ministers might have been passionately in favour of a more diverse society, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a debate they wanted to have in working men&rsquo;s clubs in Sheffield or Sunderland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the Migrationwatch think tank, said: &#8220;Now at least the truth is out, and it&rsquo;s dynamite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many have long suspected that mass immigration under Labour was not just a cock up but also a conspiracy. They were right.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Government has admitted three million immigrants for cynical political reasons concealed by dodgy economic camouflage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chairmen of the cross-party Group for Balanced Migration, MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, said: &#8220;We welcome this statement by an ex-adviser, which the whole country knows to be true.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the first beam of truth that has officially been shone on the immigration issue in Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;Our new flexible points based system gives us greater control on those coming to work or study from outside Europe, ensuring that only those that Britain need can come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britain&rsquo;s borders are stronger than ever before and we are rolling out ID cards to foreign nationals, we have introduced civil penalties for those employing illegal workers and from the end of next year our electronic border system will monitor 95 per cent of journeys in and out of the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British people can be confident that immigration is under control.&#8221;<br>

<p>That always tends to backfire.  The more you push diversity in the face of whites, the more whites don&rsquo;t like diversity.  Robert &#8220;Tut&#8221; Patterson, the founder of the Citizens Councils movement, still alive today, had an axiom to that affect.</p>

		<p>I guess the cats out of the bag. The Labour party is willing to destroy their nation so they can stay in power. Bill Clinton even admitted that he thought that the republicans would not retake the house and senate in 2010 the way they did in 1994 because of DIVERSITY. Guess how we got got that diversity. Through immigration.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t buy the line about Mexican illegals in the U.S. being an economic necessity either. Without mass numbers of brown immigrants, the Democratic Party would be dead as a doornail. They were on the cusp of becoming an anachronism. Most whites had become economically self-sufficient and numbers of the rest were small enough to be taken care of by private charity. A self-sufficient independent white population would have no need for a Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Instead, the Republican Party insisted on importing an endless supply of Democratic voters that not only raises that party from the dead but also assures its own eventual self-destruction. I can&rsquo;t believe I wasted 16 years voting for such fools.</p>
<p>The reason behind mass nonwhite immigration is not economic; it&rsquo;s partly political but mostly ideological.</p>

		<p>If we must play hard-ball politics, getting down to the nitty-gritty; if the reporter must play the &#8216;cynical&rsquo; game, why not play the game properly? Why not point out that an increase in immigration means taking in a greater number of voters who will vote labor&hellip;  As long as you can keep your motives about it quiet. Good thing the reporter doesn&rsquo;t discuss this reality here. It might give people the wrong idea. </p>

		<p> Repeat after me, folks: &#8220;Multicultural&#8221; is Latin for &#8220;darker, more violent, and more lawless.&#8221; Migration has &#8220;enriched Britain&#8221;? What a crock! It&rsquo;s now richer in crime, more people on the dole, racial strife &hellip; God protect us from such wealth!</p>
<p> Who appointed these arrogant leftists to decide that Britain was &#8220;too White&#8221; and needed some blacking up? Why, themselves, of course   &mdash;   their little coterie of smug &#8220;intellectuals,&#8221; mostly from privileged backgrounds and traitors to their class, not to mention their race. The dire predictions of Enoch Powell are coming true; the apocalyptic vision of &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; is looming hellishly over the horizon.</p>

		<p>So what this article all boils down to is that this dementedly stupid Comrade Andrew Neather, has really let the rainbow cat out of its bag. He openly admits that he and all the senior members of the last two Labour Governments, including both of the so-called Prime Ministers Blair and Straw, were purposely conspiring to alter the UK&rsquo;s racial population mix for both their own cynical gains and freakish amusements. Worse still, they did this without any consideration or care for the known wishes of the present white population of the country, or its future generations&rsquo; safety and stability.</p>
<p>There is one, and only one word for that: Treason!</p>
<p>When the BNP finally takes the country over (which I hope this glaring chunk of freshly exposed treachery will hasten about a billion-fold,) they will all be put on trial and subsequently punished without mercy. They rightfully should be turned over to the people they have so diabolically betrayed and then torn limb from limb, in a diversity of torments both rich and colorful.</p>
<p>God let it be so!!!<br>

<p>&#8220;As a result, the public argument for immigration concentrated instead on the economic benefits and need for more migrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The excuses that they were giving to import crime, poverty and violence, was that they needed more taxpayers and consumers to keep the economy going, but I never bought it one bit, mostly because these people cost the nation more than they contribute, in addition to raising crime rates and causing riots and chaos in general.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re doing is admitting to conspiratorily creating an atmosphere that has caused serious deterioration in the nation&rsquo;s society, and an economic disaster that has them on the verge of collapse.  This is a VERY high level of crime.</p>
<p>Too bad they don&rsquo;t have the old school types to contend with now, because, if they did, the citizenry would be marching on Parliament and Downing street with murder in their eyes, and the culprits would be dancing at the end of a rope.</p>
<p>These, as here in this country, are the greatest criminals in history, even worse than Mao, Stalin, and Pol Pot all combined.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s hear the same admission by the criminals in this country.</p>

		<p>The decision makers of the Labour government must surely rank amongst the most evil men ever to walk the face of the Earth.  Stating the &#8220;immigration is now under control&#8221; at this point is like locking the barn door after the horses have escaped.  At this point, the only hope for survival of the British People is forced relocation of the vast majority of third world immigrants.  Those immigrants were being used as political pawns by Labour.  As human ammunition against their own (British)people.  Labour is guilty of atrocities on several levels here.</p>

		<p>A comparison can be made to the Wannsee conference held in 1942.</p>
<p>If anyone believes that&rsquo;s an overstatement, it is not.  The Wannsee conference was a meeting organized to obtain the administrative buy-in of the branches of Germany&rsquo;s government to implement the purging of up to 10 million people from Europe during World War II.</p>
<p>This new Labour &#8216;conspiracy&rsquo; will irrevocably impact the lives and futures of over 50 million Englishmen, dispossessing them of their territorial lands, altering their genepool, and setting up internal and external conflicts with foreign races.</p>
<p>As New Labour&rsquo;s &#8216;Final Solution&rsquo; to white homogeneity in Britain, it is an infamous crime of immense proportions against a distinct people. </p>

		<p>This is a villainous conspiracy on par with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 sponsored by Teddy Kennedy, Emmanuel Celler and Philip Hart who misrepresented the act and its impact to the American people.  The article informs the reader that the liberal elites (Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett) conspired to diversity England as had been done by the liberal troika mentioned above.  Why would any group of men conspire to destroy the culture and civilization of their native countries unless they abhorred them.</p>

<p>Well, this isn&rsquo;t any different then the way the Democrats are acting in this country. They see mass immigration from third world countries as their key to a one-major party system and everlasting power.Of course non-white third worlders are more then willing to go along with this sham, for the time being, that&rsquo;s until they realize they are the majority and then they won&rsquo;t need the Democrats anymore then they need the Republicans.</p>

<p>They talk the talk all day long but when it comes time to walk the walk, most of them don&rsquo;t even get up.  They never will.  Diversity is not something they really believe in or they would be living it already.</p>

		<p>The Labour party is evil. I mean that. They don&rsquo;t care about the indigenous people of Britain. They never have. When they got their first majority government they opened the floodgates. That was way back in 1948. They are still doing it. WHY ANYONE would vote for them is beyond me.</p>

		<p>Not just the UK Labour Party, but virtually every current left-wing oriented government, political party, and NGO desires to diminish the power and presence of whites in their respective nations.  The quickest way to accomplish this is to allow mass third-world immigration, and to pass internal laws and regulations favoring the third-world immigrants and other minorities.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds vagually familiar to those in the Unites States effectively the same things occurred during the Clinton, GW Bush, and Obama regimes.</p>

		<p>The purpose of diversity is to create a large pool of low-wage labor that is intended to keep the Left-wing party in power indefinitely.  In the US, Obama could not have been elected without it.  The Republican Party is committing slow suicide by also promoting immigration of the poor and non-white to please business which wants a permanent large pool of low-wage workers.  The American middle-class is being slowly phased out.</p>

<p>Well, I hate to tell you this, but the illustrious Mayor Bloomberg of New York, just reiterated today, that illegal aliens are an ecnomic neccessity and benefit. Afterall, Mayor Mike has asked the profound question before that, &#8220;if illegal aliens were deported from Nuevo York,who would take care of the golf courses? Civilized Neighbor, don&rsquo;t take this concern of Mayor Mikes too lightly. He has supporters.

<p>I have the perfect punishment for the liberal traitors that brought all of those multicultural immigrants into the UK.  When the BNP takes over, the liberal traitors should be flown in on a helicopter, to some black or Muslim neigborhood in the middle of the night.  After the helicopter lands in a park area, the liberals should be told to get out.  The helicopter will then fly away.  The liberals would then be on there own to see if they could get out of the neighborhood without being mugged, robbed, and/or murdered!&hellip;Just an idea!!!!</p>

The revelations are truly shocking, not least because they reveal to be true that which many have been saying for years ie New Labour promoted mass non-White immigration for cynical hidden reasons of its own, but it also reveals the appaling low intellectual quality at the heart of the Blair administation (read Neather&rsquo;s full article for the childish, hysterical nature of his prose), and a vindictiveness bordering on psychopathy amongst the highest echelons of New Labour.<br>
 Take the phrase &#8216;rubbing the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rsquo;. The allusion must be to rubbing a dog&rsquo;s nose in its own excrement.Does Andrew Neather really and truly subliminally compare immigrants to dog faeces?<br>
 Neather goes on to wax lyrical that mass immigration personally enabled him to employ cheap and reiable domestic servants - a pressing concern for this avowed hard-left anti-capitalist socialist in fact.Reminds me of the perpetual complaint one used to hear from the elderly dowagers and Indian Army widows of Belgravia back in the 1970s - &#8220;Oh, one simply CANNOT find the staff these days&#8221;.<br>

Any person can see this is the British version of racial treason.  Now, let us consider the American version of racial treachery and betrayal (Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, the 1980s amnesty, the uncontrolled Mexican border, the future amnesty bill legalizing probably 20 to 30 million illegal Mexicans, etc.).  The Democrats and Republicans in Washington simply state, through old and tired-out euphemisms, yes, we are going to completely ruin the European American country of the United States and there is nothing the European American can do about it.  One must ask himself or herself, when is the last time this country has openly and overtly done anything (policy, act, regulation, law, etc.) for the European American?

		<p>The huge increases in migrants over the last decade were partly due to a politically motivated attempt by ministers to radically change the country and &ldquo;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rdquo;, according to Andrew Neather, a former adviser to Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett.</p>
<p>   So, Labour wanted a permanent majority in Parliament through Third World immigration? We should also consider this a misguided attempt at massive social engineering by the left. Neo Marxists look upon the promulgation of diversity as new kind of religion. Their &#8220;great dream&#8221; is the elimination of racism by miscegenation. If everyone is mixed, so they reason, than the reason for racism disappears. We can see how successful this is in Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and many other countries.</p>

<p>Andrew Neather and the 1965 Immigration Act&hellip;I get it.<br>
By Patrick Cleburne</p>
<p>The news that the huge acceleration of the immigrant influx into the UK under the Tony Blair Prime Ministership was the result of deliberate anti-historic nation malice – reported by Brenda Walker and Steve Sailer yesterday – will not surprise regular VDARE.com readers.</p>
<p>Exactly the same appears to have been the case with the US 1965 Immigration Act. </p>
<p>Andrew Neather, whose urge to boast surfaced this confession in the charmingly titled article &#8220;Don&rsquo;t listen to the whingers - London needs immigrants&#8221; is, for the age of Google, very elusive to research. Although the name might be thought to be English, it was virtually unknown in Ancestry.com&rsquo;s benchmark 1891 Census sweep – recently adopted perhaps?</p>
<p>But a familiar pattern emerges from the article (which is notable for the contempt it evinces for any British not living in London):</p>
<p>I wrote the landmark speech given by then immigration minister Barbara Roche in September 2000, calling for a loosening of controls. It marked a major shift from the policy of previous governments: from 1971 onwards, only foreigners joining relatives already in the UK had been permitted to settle here.</p>
<p>&hellip;despite Roche&rsquo;s keenness to&hellip;be upfront, there was a reluctance elsewhere in government to discuss what increased immigration would mean&hellip;</p>

<p>Real change in government requires a lot more than voting. A show of real force is the only thing that&rsquo;s ever made any sort of significant change in the way governments are ran. </p>
<p>Keep voting if it makes you fell better but a the end of the day you end up with the same governemnt that you had yesterday but see a different face on TV.  </p>

<p>NOW MUSLIMS DEMAND FULL SHARIA LAW</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A RADICAL Muslim group sparked outrage last night as it launched a massive campaign to impose sharia law on Britain.</p>
<p>The fanatical group Islam4UK has ­announced plans to hold a potentially ­incendiary rally in London later this month.</p>
<p>And it is calling for a complete upheaval of the British legal system, its officials and legislation.</p>
<p>Members have urged Muslims from all over Britain to converge on the capital on October 31 for a procession to demand the full implementation of sharia law&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yz5hzxd" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yz5hzxd</a></p>
<p>This is what Labour has unleashed on native Britons  &mdash;  and it will only grow more powerful, the demands louder and more forceful and eventually become unstoppable as Muslim numbers increase and native Whites decrease.</p>
<p>There no longer will be a Labour Party or British Law if this is not stopped NOW, and the Muslim colonists expelled.  The Muslim purpose is to take over the government and lands of the UK and they are doing it through high birthrates and immigration. </p>
<p>Native Britons of the near future, under the subjugation of  Shiria Law  will watch as their monuments are torn down, their statues desecrated, their streets re-named, their history forgotten and re-written, their books burned, their traditions outlawed and the British flag shredded. They will be subjected to death for fighting what has been done to them by the out-lawed Labour Party just so at one time in the past,  Labour could &#8220;rub the right&rsquo;s noses in multi-culturalism and import more votes for Labour.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
There will be no turning back from what the Labour Party has unleashed in its own native lands.</p>
<p>Evil does not being to describe what has been done to the native populations of the UK.</p>

<p>&gt; Not in my longtime experience - it has been mostly logging corps in the west of the US that buy up land or lease it for pennies in order to clear cut that ruin land.  It is well known that the government was selling trees for what turned out to be $1.00 each.  These big corps don&rsquo;t care about the wildlife at all; they hate the very idea of conservation of resources.  But perhaps you don&rsquo;t live in the Northwest, where these issues are well known.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is goverment, and big business in bed with big government, that create most of our environmental problems. The small landowner, farmer, or rancher doesn&rsquo;t want to spoil the land they spent so much purchasing and improving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Not so in the West, where most government land (managed by the BLM) exists.  The government has only cow-towed to big corps.  Famously, the oldest redwoods in Northern California were being cut down and sold to big Japanese corps cheap, who would sit just outside the territorial waters on milling ships that used cheap Chinses labor and then sell the lumber back to US at a huge profit.  I learned that much of our Redwood forests are actually now buried on Japanese beaches (for preservation for future use).  Our government went along with this&hellip; and the activity began and flourished under Reagan&rsquo;s tenure.</p>

<p>&gt; You are flatly wrong here.  IF you check the Sierra Club site, you will find that they are against illegal immigration exactly because they are doing more damage to public lands than every before.  This was actually on the MSM last year, I remember it.</p>

		<p>If you accept the economic argument for increased non-white immigration, then you are accepting an economic theory-system of growth that requires the race-replacement of the Native English for otherwise there can be no economy that can provide jobs at high wages. This is an insane economic theory-system. Yet, they expect the Native English to accept it. Actually, it is more than insane&hellip;.it is a fundamentally evil economic theory-system, for it is an economic theory-system that insists  that the Native English commit race suicide in their own nation. This is just another way of saying that this economic theory-system harbors geonicidal intent towards the Native English.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;IF you check the Sierra Club site, you will find that they are against illegal immigration exactly because they are doing more damage to public lands than every before&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Could you please post a link?  I called up the site and searched their entire national and local databases and found only this from their 2009 Q &amp; A section:<br>

Hey Mr. Green,</p>
<p>Why does the Sierra Club refuse to take a stand on illegal migration and historically high legal immigration?  –Michael in Ashburn, Virginia</p>
<p>While some of my environmentally minded readers dread any reduction in procreation&hellip; others, like you, want to shut the immigrants out. I just hope you&rsquo;re not in favor of that environmentally destructive boondoggle of a fence they&rsquo;re building on our border with Mexico.</p>
<p>The simplest answer to your question about the Sierra Club&rsquo;s immigration policy is that the Club&rsquo;s members voted overwhelmingly some time ago to remain neutral on this issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this, as part of their Official Policy:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Sierra Club affirms the decision of the Board of Directors to take NO position on U.S. immigration levels and policies&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;One of the interesting facts which came to light during the election was the curious &mdash; and still mysterious &mdash; contribution of $100 million to the [Sierra Club] brought to light by Dick Lamm. Was the cash a generous shovelful from extremist George Soros? Or did it come from the Mexican government in return for a promise to avoid the annoying immigration topic?</p>
<p>The Sierra Club had already supported California drivers&rsquo; licenses for illegal aliens in the state &mdash; hardly an environmental issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Seems they&rsquo;re more interested in subverting the border fence and collecting huge donations than environment-destroying illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>#51 Whiteplight, Techno Dan is right. I don&rsquo;t care what the Sierra Clubs website says. La Raza&rsquo;s website says they are for helping all people, equality for all, workers rights and other tripe. No,they are for Latino&rsquo;s and illegal aliens &#8220;rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>The main donater to the Sierra Club, a billionaire who&rsquo;s name has escaped me, stipulated that if the Sierra Club takes and &#8220;anti immigrant&#8221; stance, he will pull his support of a hundred million dollars. Now, I ask you, do you believe the people who run the Sierra Club aren&rsquo;t influenced by a hundred million dollars? It&rsquo;s no secret what the phrase &#8220;anti immigrant&#8221; (read illegal alien)means any longer.</p>
