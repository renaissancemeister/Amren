			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), October 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Department of Homeland Security has just reported that only 894 miles of this country&rsquo;s 8,607 miles of America&rsquo;s land borders, are actually being protected. The announcement came in the agency&rsquo;s 2009 Performance Report.</p>
<p>While that admission is maddening, given the federal government&rsquo;s recent history on border issues, it should come as a surprise to no one.</p>
<p>We have seen the Obama administration water-down the highly effective 287g program, covertly offer government funded healthcare to illegal aliens, and promise amnesty to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican government is amongst the most corrupt on the planet. Based on reports from U.S. Border Patrol Agents, we know that Mexican troops and police officers often assist drug smugglers as well as the so-called &#8216;coyotes&rsquo; to cross into this country illegally.</p>
<p>In 2006, it was learned that the Mexican government was printing and distributing to its citizenry, how-to manuals which contained tips on entering the U.S. illegally. Despite the evidence that the Mexican government is in large measure to blame for millions of invaders entering this country, both Bush and Obama want us to believe that Mexico is a close ally!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican government has never made any effort to police our shared border, nor do they have any intention to ever do so. The Mexican nationals living illegally in this country send most of their wages back to Mexico in the form of wire transfers. In fact, remittances to Mexico are a $20 billion a year industry. It has become a tremendous part of Mexico&rsquo;s economy and is second only to their oil exports.</p>
<p>Mexico sends their poor, their drugs, and their criminals to the United States. The Mexican ruling class rids itself of millions of undesirables annually and in exchange, billions of U.S. dollars pour into their economy. In turn, our cities become full of poverty and crime; our schools become overcrowded with Spanish-only speaking children; and our hospitals are forced into bankruptcy due to unpaid medical bills, left by illegal aliens. Any U.S./Mexican alliance is truly a one-sided relationship.</p>
<p>U.S. troops are currently patrolling the borders of South Korea, Bosnia, Croatia, Iraq, and Pakistan. For some reason, our troops are still defending Germany! However, the Obama administration refuses to our troops to protect our own border. Apparently, the lives of the aforementioned nations are more precious to our president than are those of American citizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2005, the Government Accountability Office announced the results of a study which examined the criminal history of 55,322 illegal aliens who were incarcerated in federal, state, and local institutions during the year 2003. The results of that study follow:</p>
<p>The 55,322 illegal aliens in the study accounted for a total of 459,614 arrests (or eight arrests per illegal alien).</p>
<p>Their arrests represented a total of nearly 700,000 criminal offenses (or 13 offenses per illegal alien).</p>
<p>36 percent of those studied had been arrested at least five times previously.</p>

		<p>The uncontrolled influx of Mexicans brings communicable disease here, too - that statement&rsquo;s not &#8220;racist&#8221; but FACTUAL.  No one who&rsquo;s seen &#8220;The Godfather II&#8221; can forget the scene where the young Vito Corleone is medically examined and quarantined before he is allowed entry into the United States.  I am at a loss to understand how we lost sight of such common sense health measures in managing immigration in the past half-century.</p>

		<p>In the past eight years billions have been applied to border surveillance research in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>
<p>Before that it was Vietnam and the Ho Chi Minh trail.</p>
<p>Before that it was Korea and the 38th parallel.</p>
<p>With the right priorities and willpower, the border with Mexico can be militarily defended.   </p>

		<p> The Head of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, the one who couldn&rsquo;t even control the illegals coming over the border in Arizona, now says that violence in Mexico is not yet spilling across the U.S. Border. She acknowledges rising violence in Mexico, but says while U.S. officials are preparing for that violence to spill across the border it has not yet. She denied recently that the latest drug-fueled violence in Mexico has spilled across the border, even as local officials throughout the country see troubling signs of Mexican gang activity.   As governor of Arizona, she vetoed several initiatives to crack down  on illegal aliens.  She has also pulled Border Patrol officers off the southern border and placed them on the northern border on the theory that we needed to protect both borders equally.  Janet Napolitano is another typical Obama appointment.  She has never wanted to crack down on the illegal invasion and now she&rsquo;s in charge of border enforcement.</p>

		<p>There is a direct correlation between centralization and tyranny. That&rsquo;s why the Founding Fathers created a system that limits the power of the federal government in favor of local authority. It&rsquo;s also why the left-wing tyrants in Washington are going after Maricopa County, Arizona&rsquo;s heroic sheriff Joe Arpaio.<br>
Sheriff Joe is famous for standing up to slimy liberal mollusks like Phoenix Mayor Fail Gordon and doing what is right by enforcing the law. This puts him in direct opposition to the Obamanation Administration, which sides aggressively with the drug-dealers, human traffickers, and other lowlife illegally pouring over our essentially unguarded border.<br>
In a cruel joke, former Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano was put in charge of Homeland Security on the basis of her experience with the border, which she steadfastly refused to defend. Now she is using her frightening powers to target Arpaio for doing the job she refuses to do.  Napolitano should be the last person to be put in charge of enforcement of the border!</p>

		<p>Most Americans who have argued against illegal immigration in the past, did so for good reasons. In this disastrous economy, for politicians to continue to allow the borders to essentially stay open, and constantly talk about amnesty for millions of foreign nationals here illegally, is beyond irresponsible. It&rsquo;s just plain immoral. What about all of the taxes and other considerations, such as military service, volunteerism,etc., that Americans have contributed to this nation? Others, who have contributed essentially squat, are to have priority over them?! It&rsquo;s immoral as can be.</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s support among blacks is nearly universal. Yet unskilled and illegal Mexican immigrants certainly take jobs that could be held by blacks. Seems logical that those most hurt by Obams&rsquo;s open door immigration policies are Obama&rsquo;s biggest supporters. Apparently understanding this is beyond the reasoning abilities of most blacks. </p>

<p>Sappy Nappy is a joke at HLS.  I think the only reason Obama put her there or anywhere in the cabinet is a payback to McCain for laying down in the campaign.  Sappy Nappy was McCain&rsquo;s only real competition for another term in the Senate.</p>

		<p>Closing the mexican border is neither impossible or difficult. I calculated that we would need only only 4 brigades to cover the border. We could place a soldier every 100 yards and still have a few battalios in reserve. This is less than what we have in Afganistan. The commander in chief just has to give the order.</p>

		<p>The ruling elite really do want our country to be filled with low I.Q. people, crime and social problems.  They really do want the USA to be Mexicanized and for Whites to blend themselves out of existence.  </p>
<p>Here we are, a country that develops the latest military technology yet our leaders can&rsquo;t stop millions of Mexicans from invading and bankrupting us.  Sure!  </p>
<p>The USA is not being changed into a Third World country for nothing.  The elite have their reasons, and they plan on coming out on top.</p>

		<p>Mexico&rsquo;s biggest revenue producers:</p>
<p>Oil and transfers from the U.S.</p>
<p>They have oil revenues because they were born on top of it not because of some invention or technology on their part.</p>
<p>And because of wealth created in the U.S.</p>
<p>That pretty much says it all.<br>

		<p>Anonymous #10, you hit the nail on the proverbial head. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been saying since the Big O was on the campaign trail. The (the elite) found exactly what they were looking for: a bi-racial (to appeal to both black and white lamebrains), multi-religiously connected (to both Christians and Muslims), unusually literate, above average orator and ingrained left wing puppet. I can&rsquo;t imagine how long it took them to find and cultivate this paragon, but it&rsquo;s a no-brainer that his millions upon millions of dollars in campaign contributions did not come from this country. </p>

<p>There must be a theory when making such a major accusation.  What could their reason be? Here is my explanation - or try at it; The &#8220;elites&#8221; are really the multinational corps, politicians are merely their servants.  They already know that the trend is politically and economically probable, so they have set their plans for this end.  They did not necessarily plan for this to happen, but seeing now that it is a likely end, they are setting themselves up to come out on top financially. </p>
<p> But these people are nothing more than bourgeois themselves.  Many are recent new money execs from India or somewhere else.  Check it out, most are NOT white.  Their families will not continue the continuity of control the way Euro-American society once did.  There will be a constant scramble for control.  In the end, the corporate world will resemble a mafia, (if they don&rsquo;t already).  </p>
<p>Because there are no longer any ethics in business, no fix will endure.  The corruption is permanent and only a hard global crash, that percipitates civil wars and revolution everywhere will be able to set the stage for any  possible reform.  It will be a terrible time, like a world wide French Reign of Terror, but there will not be a New Republic as a result.  A long Dark Age will emerge and no one can predict how it will go except that the world is more full of dangers and methods of self-destruction than any science fiction novel has ever predicted.</p>

		<p>Shortly after September 11, 2001, I thought the US government is now finally going to get serious about defending the nation by sealing our borders.  Back then it was also reported that around 5000 young arab males here on various student and other visas had dropped out of sight.  Again, I thought the US is going to get serious and cease issuing student and other visas to arab males until it can hunt down and deal with all the 5000 missing.  I&rsquo;m still waiting.  Our government continues to dither and waste trillions.  The national debt has doubled since 2001. We have not secured our borders, the Iraq borders or the Afghanistan borders.  How is it that countries like North Korea, China, East Germany, Iran, Turkey, Russia and others tightly control their borders while the United States of America, the most powerful nation on earth, will not?  We are being invaded every day. The Border Patrol has even coined a term OTM&rsquo;s (Other Than Mexicans) for the muslims they apprehend trying to slip in from the middle east via Mexico. We are doomed. It&rsquo;s now only a matter of time.  I&rsquo;m lucky to have seen the US in the years 1945-1964.  Those good, prosperous, safe  days are now all gone with the wind, never to return.  </p>

		<p>The one very simple way jihadists could destroy the economic structure of this country is to send small groups of sleeper cells across the Mexican border with the mission to plant explosives in varies businesses that a lot of the public frequents.  The tactic would be a thousand times more effective than flying an airplane into a building or bringing down a single structure.</p>
<p>The only reason I can come up with that they haven&rsquo;t done so to date is that we&rsquo;ve given them too much credit for being clever and innovative, and they&rsquo;re not really very bright.</p>
<p>Claiming that Bush&rsquo;s policy of listening in on phone and radio messages was responsible for no other attacks since 9-11, is pure hogwash, just as searching grandma and grandpa at the airport is and making them take off their shoes, while laws are invoked making these same people turn their driver&rsquo;s license into a national I.D. card.  It&rsquo;s all an assinine response to rectify the situation. All unguarded borders in the world can be easily infiltrated to do whatever a devious sabateur wants to do. </p>
<p>The crowd in Washington and the media are so corrupt and out of touch with the real world nothing will change until the entire mess erupts into successful mass secessionist movements and/or civil conflict on a national scale.  </p>
