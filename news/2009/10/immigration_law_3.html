<h1><a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/10/immigration_law_1.php#at">Immigration Lawyers Take the Fight to ICE</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas MacMillan, New Haven Independent, October 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten New Haven residents are filing suit against the federal agents behind the 2007 New Haven immigration raids. They claim that their arrests were an unlawful retaliation for the city&rsquo;s immigrant-friendly ID card program.</p>
<p>When Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers swept into town on June 6, 2007, they rounded up 29 immigrants who had allegedly entered the country illegally.</p>
<p>In June, Yale attorneys successfully derailed deportation orders against five of those arrested, since ICE agents had entered their homes unconstitutionally.</p>
<p>Now, the Yale Law School students are going on the offensive. On Wednesday they&rsquo;ll file a lawsuit on behalf of 10 of the people arrested in 2007. The suit will argue that ICE agents violated their constitutional rights, that ICE supervisors orchestrated the raids as retaliation for the creation of the Elm City ID card, and that high-level ICE officials failed to supervise their staff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plaintiffs seek damages and declaratory relief.</p>

		<p>&#8221; since ICE agents had entered their homes unconstitutionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is their entering the home unconstitutional? They were here illegally, hence lawbreakers by their very presence. I didn&rsquo;t think they had constitutional rights, because they are not citizens of the USA.</p>

		<p>They accuse the ICE agents of entering their homes unconstitutionally?  Look at the pot calling the kettle black&hellip;</p>
<p>Did a tornado scoop up their house and drop it into Kansas like some sort of bizarro Wizard of Oz?  How did their hacienda get in our country?  Sort of like &#8216;How did Jose&rsquo;s wallet get into my pocket?&rsquo;</p>
