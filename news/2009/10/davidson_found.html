<h1>Davidson Found Guilty of Murders; Penalty Phase of Trial Will Begin Today</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, October 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the sifting of the evidence done and the guilty verdicts rendered, a Knox County jury today must turn to the scales of justice to weigh the fate of convicted torture-slaying ringleader Lemaricus Davidson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The jury&rsquo;s job will be three-fold:</p>
<p>* Decide whether aggravating factors, such as the heinousness of the crimes and prior criminal history, have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>* Determine if circumstances such as mental health woes, addictions or childhood abuse exist in Davidson&rsquo;s background.</p>
<p>* Then, weigh the two.</p>
<p>If the scales tip toward the aggravators, the law commands a death sentence. If the scales tip toward the mitigating circumstances, the jury then must decide between a sentence of life without parole and life, which carries a mandatory 51-year prison term.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This five-woman, seven-man jury spent roughly seven hours over two days deliberating Davidson&rsquo;s guilt. They deemed him guilty of 35 of 38 counts, ranging from the murder of both Christian and Newsom to kidnapping to robbery. They also found Davidson guilty of multiple counts of raping Christian.</p>
<p>Davidson&rsquo;s only reprieve  &mdash;  and it was largely irrelevant because of the murder convictions  &mdash;  came in the rape of Newsom. With no DNA evidence to directly link him to a rape that forensic evidence suggested was committed with an object, jurors opted for convictions of the lesser charge of facilitation of aggravated rape.</p>
<p>Davidson is the second of four suspects to be tried. His brother, Letalvis Cobbins, was convicted in August and sentenced to life without parole.</p>
<p>Pending trial are suspects George Thomas, who will face a Hamilton County jury Dec. 1, and Vanessa Coleman, whose case is on hold pending a pre-trial appeal.</p>
<p>A fifth suspect, Eric Boyd, remains uncharged in the killings but is serving an 18-year federal prison term for hiding out Davidson after the slayings.</p>
<p>Davidson demanded a Knox County jury, a move that had proven a mystery until the trial got under way.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that Davidson&rsquo;s strategy relied upon a panel of jurors who thought they knew the basics of this fatal crime spree until they heard Davidson&rsquo;s claims. Those claims centered on the notion that Christian and Newsom were not innocent victims but willing visitors to Davidson&rsquo;s Chipman Street drug house.</p>
<p>But jurors soundly rejected Davidson&rsquo;s defense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judge Richard Baumgartner on Wednesday afternoon sent jurors back to the hotel where they have been sequestered since the trial began more than a week ago to rest up for today&rsquo;s penalty phase.</p>
<p>Eldridge told the judge he and Trant intend to summon at least eight witnesses to the stand on Davidson&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>During jury selection, the attorneys quizzed potential jurors about their knowledge of bi-polar disorder. Davidson himself told police he suffered from that mental condition when he was interrogated shortly after his arrest. It is, therefore, likely that a psychiatrist will be called to testify today about Davidson&rsquo;s mental health.<br>

		<p>I have had years of miserable, embarrassing, even torturous experience dealing with a family member who was afflicted with bipolar disorder. It&rsquo;s a terrible disease and it&rsquo;s something that nobody should have to deal with. </p>
<p>Despite the sympathy I hold for his affliction, I hope this guy never sees the light of day, ever again. </p>

		<p>Unbelievable! Today&rsquo;s Knoxnews is reporting that &#8220;At the request of defense attorney Doug Trant, Baumgartner said that he will tell jurors that a 2004 study by the state Comptroller&rsquo;s Office concluded that execution is a more expensive form of punishment than life without parole.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If there were ever a case that warranted the death penalty - this is most certainly it. It is my opinion that all involved with the murder of Channon and Christopher should without delay, be punished by execution. </p>
<p>I was partially raised in Florida, and as a result, I have a particular preference for the electric chair. I would like for Mr. Davidson to meet &#8220;Ol Sparky.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>If this person (and I use that term loosely)is not a candidate for the death penalty, then, please tell me: Who is? And how is your childhood experiences a &#8220;mitigating factor&#8221;? Huh? I thought a mitigating factor would be something like, being drunk, or high, at the time, or being under a certain age, or not being mentally competent. The point is, this individual knew exactly what he was doing, and that it was wrong. It is not like the cases where someone kills his best friend in a fit of rage when he is caught in bed with his wife. There was absolutely no provocation here. But, enough of common sense. I am just guilty that this pathetic excuse for a human was found guilty, even though he will never REALLY get what he deserves-at least not in this life.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous, but they will not give him the death penalty.  Despite what the lying media say, whites are much more likely to be executed than blacks.  Putting blacks on death row, especially for crimes committed against whites, is un-PC.  </p>

<p>&#8220;could be a productive citizen if he is then locked up for the rest of his life&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me try and think how Lemaricus is going to be a productive citizen in a Tennessee prison&hellip;oh yea, he will spend his time inventing a cure for cancer or a low-cost, synthetic fuel that will put OPEC out of business or maybe he will be able to intervene in the Middle East?</p>
<p>This woman needs to leave that crack pipe alone.</p>
<p>Tennessee corrections is in a financial crisis at the moment, forcing them to let &#8220;low-risk&#8221; prisoners walk. &#8220;With the state&rsquo;s budget crisis forcing $42 million in cuts to a corrections program that will receive almost no federal stimulus money&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides adding yet another burden to the taxpayers of Tennesee,Lemaricus will most likely join one of the gangs and be ultra-productive by spending his time in the TV room, lifting weights or assisting in the gang rape of a white prisoner.</p>

You know this woman Rhea would simply like to see him released.  A lot of blacks would simply like to see Davidson set free.  He killed this couple in the most horrific way and many blacks would like to see him simply set free. I used to live right next to Oakland California.  During that time I was around a lot of blacks.  Never before had I ever been.  I was very naive at the time about race.  I learned a few things though about the attitudes of blacks.  What I said about this woman wanting to see this young murderer set scot free after murdering these two white kids in the most horrific way is true.  Before I had spent some time living next to Oakland,  which is for all esential purposes a dirty african city,  I would have never believed it if anyone were to tell me that grown mature blacks could hold so much hatred and contempt for whites that they would advocate no punishment for the killing of whites by their people.  Even the murder of white children.  Oh I learned when I was living next to the little piece of Africa known as Oakland.  I truly did learn about blacks.  </p>

		<p>A great number of blacks quite simply and literally do not believe that what they call &#8220;the white mans law(s)&#8221; apply to them. This was a very common attitude among the ghetto and non ghetto blacks that I encountered during my stay next to the dirty, filthy, nasty and dangerous city known as Oakland.  I am not kidding when I say that there was absolutely nothing worth being a part of or getting involved with in Oakland.  </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s about to go to a &#8220;structured environment.&#8221;  He will probably be there everything he could be, and in fact he will be &#8220;an influence to young men for years to come.&#8221;  A bad influence, but an influence nonetheless.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t most Southern states have such &#8220;structured environments&#8221; for blacks until 1964?  People like this mother quoted here were the kind of people yelling to end segregation and Jim Crow.  What she admits is that blacks just can&rsquo;t make it as free and real equals to whites.</p>

<p>Along with their verdict, the jury should return a brief note to the defence attorney and his (hopefully soon condemned) client:  Yeah, we know that execution is more expensive.  It&rsquo;s an added expense that we will willingly pay.</p>

<p>  I feel that way about the whole black race.  I feel that there is a reason that our form of government developed where it did, and I think it is because we HAD a sense of responsibility and a can-do attitude.</p>
<p>  Africans and people of African descent claim to want freedom, but given the chance everytime they will vote themselves right back into a cradle-to-the-grave form of tyranny, or through their actions create a situation where totalitarian force is the only answer to keep society from falling apart.</p>
<p>  If left up to the free market of reality blacks would quickly return to the minority population of earth that they were 150 years ago.  I think I read somewhere in that time the black population of Africa was just 70 million, but it now over 700 million, because of European technology and now European (and European-American) money.<br>

		<p>Seeing that I have a second shift job, I was able to watch the trial this week live on the internet.</p>
<p>ERIC-  surprise! you were wrong,. they DID give him the death penalty!   And the judge said that although it is more expensive to put him to death, to not consider that in their decision.  </p>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t understand is why do we have to entertain this monster with ANY appeals?   Just take him to the town green, erect a gallows and hang him.  How much could that cost?  I&rsquo;d even pay for a ticket or parking to get to watch.  This would be a big example to the rest of his tribe that these things will not be tolerated.  He is guilty WAY BEYOND any reasonable doubt.  The attorneys tried to put delicately that the fluids from her rape through gravity and the postion she was in in the garbage pail came to be deposited in the other area.  This was disgusting to have to hear.  They tried to say it was consentual sex, and her mother let it be known in an interview that she was proud of her daughter for saving herself for marriage, which made this monster&rsquo;s act all the worse, if there is such a thing.  One of the prosecutors&rsquo; assistants fainted at the sight of some of the forensic photos.  </p>
<p>The defense tried to get the jury to spare his life by bringing all these witnesses who said how well the idiot does in a structured environment, and they also told how he had several chances to turn his life around.  The whole thing backfired on the defense because it showed that with all the chances, he CHOSE his path and it nullified any sympathy for his growing up with a drunken pig for a mother.  </p>
<p>To poster 14,. yes, I totally agree with you about africans.  They revert to the stone age as soon as you remove any white influence.  There is a reason why they call it the &#8220;dark continent&#8221;, and it is dark in more ways than one.</p>
