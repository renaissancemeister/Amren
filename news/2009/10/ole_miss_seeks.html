<h1>Ole Miss Seeks to Silence &#8216;Rising South&rsquo; Chant</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheila Byrd, Google News, October 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The University of Mississippi has shortened one of its fight songs to discourage football fans from chanting &#8220;the South will rise again&#8221; during part of the tune, which critics say is an offensive reminder of the region&rsquo;s intolerant past.</p>
<p>However, some fans have continued to recite the chant at the end of the song, &#8220;From Dixie With Love,&#8221; despite the change made last week at the chancellor&rsquo;s request. The Ole Miss band performs the medley before and after games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Ole Miss student government passed a resolution suggesting the chant be replaced by the phrase, &#8220;To hell with LSU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan Jones, who became Ole Miss chancellor in July, said he asked the school&rsquo;s band director, David Wilson, to modify the song to support the efforts of the Associated Student Body. He said he has received complaints from alumni that the slogan is offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, the phrase &#8216;The South Will Rise Again&rsquo; is not part of our tradition or spirit, and it is inconsistent with the university&rsquo;s values and what Ole Miss stands for  &mdash;  a great public university with a focus on the future,&#8221; Jones said in a phone interview Thursday from the campus in Oxford.</p>
<p>The modified version of the song ends abruptly before the chanting phase starts. It was first played Saturday at Ole Miss&rsquo;s homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham, but that didn&rsquo;t stop some fans from chanting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The song blends the Confederate Army&rsquo;s fight song, &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; with the Union Army&rsquo;s &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic,&#8221; according to Peter K. Frost, a visiting professor of history and international studies at Ole Miss.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university six years ago decided not to have an on-field mascot during sporting events, getting rid of the long-standing Colonel Rebel, a white-haired old man who carries a cane and resembles a plantation owner. At the time, school officials had said they needed a more athletic-looking mascot. The teams are still called the Rebels.</p>
<p>Sophomore Cortez Moss, director of communications for the ASB, said the organization is trying to explain to students why the phrase is offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take back on that slave mentality,&#8221; said Moss, who is black. &#8220;I know the South won&rsquo;t rise again and the South can&rsquo;t rise again.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The ethnic cleansing at the University of Mississippi has been going on since at least the mid-1990s, when Osama bin Khayat became Chancellor and banned Confederate flags at football games, and used sharp flag pole edges as an excuse.  So people started coming to the games at Ole Miss with flags attached to soft plastic with rounded edges, and the U. had to back down.</p>

<p>I wish these kids would stand together and tell the chancellor he should take his head from where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine and look around if he hasn&rsquo;t noticed anything intolerant of the society in which we now live.</p>
<p>Political correctness is the most intolerant ideology on record, and can only exist within a totalitarian society.</p>

		<p>The events over the last 30 years at Ole Miss are a a thorn in my side. The once great symbol of the south &#8216;Ole Miss&rsquo; has been deliberately usurped by radicals and Leftists whose mission is to destroy every vestige of the Old South.  However, this does not have to be the case. If fans and alumni would simply stand up to these bigots in ways which would hurt the University&rsquo;s pocket-book then Mississippi Southerners could control their university once again and have their heritage protected.  Simply empty the sports stadiums and have the alumni boycott any further funding and/or sending their kids to college there.  A few months of that and the sell-out &#8220;chancellor&#8221; and all his minions would fold likle card-board.  They&rsquo;re only in it for the money and careers anyway.</p>

What would work, if these kids had true conviction, is to boycott games and events.</p>
<p>However, despite what they say about the fight song, I believe most of them would put the game before their principles. &#8220;Football Uber Alles&#8221;.</p>

		<p>We had a similar fight here in NC over the summer because a local High School is called the Rebels, and a tiny chapter of the NAACP from the next town over, tried to force the school board to change the name. Well, they took on the wrong commuinty, because they got a smackdown they are still reeling from. The kids from this HS joined together with their parents and stood up to them. It just goes to show that unity is the only way we can win.</p>
<p>How dare 29 members of the NAACP who don&rsquo;t even live in this town, nor have kids that attend this HS dictate to us what to nickname our HS. They have been the Rebels for 50 years, plus this school is 90% white. I know they were shocked that their white guilt trip didn&rsquo;t work, and we refused to bow down to them.<br>
IMO, the NAACP has nothing better to do with their time, so they have to find something to complain about to justify their very exsistance, no matter how silly.</p>

		<p>Technically it is a self inflicted insult to be called or label Ole Miss as Rebels anyway since not only is that the name the Yanks bestowed on the south after it split but we know the Brits in 1776 called the colonies the Rebels that was switched to Patriots.</p>
<p>The 11 southern states were not rebels but were Patriots and we know the Pilgrims headed for the south at Jamestown Virginia blew of course in 1621 and accidently landed in what is now Massachutes and stole the New England name too that was meant for the South not the north. </p>
<p>Ole Miss needs to reassess whether they want to continue to be called the slanderous name given to the the South with the Rebel libelous term when in fact the real America where it all began and where all the intellects and founding documents came from has always been in the South where the Patriots of the real New England and New Europe were forumlated into a white caucasoid melting pot nation.</p>

		<p>The University of Toledo changed their fight song years ago, because it was &#8220;racist&#8221;:</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>U of Toledo, We&rsquo;ll fight for you (Fight! Fight! Fight!)</p>
<p>U of Toledo, We love that Gold and Blue (Let&rsquo;s go Blue!)</p>
<p>Men of the Varsity, The enemy must yield,</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll fight just like our ancestors And march right down the field! T-O-L-E-D-O, Toledo!</p>
<p>Verse (no longer used)</p>
<p>The Indians roamed the Maumee River land<br>
Till along came Anthony Wayne.<br>
Old England was the ruler of the Lakes,<br>
Till Perry gained his fame.<br>
They were fighters and victorious<br>
And they drove back every foe.<br>
Gave their legends and traditions<br>
To the school we honor so.</p>
<p>Dave Connelly, UT athletic director and baseball coach through the 1930s and 1940s, wrote &#8220;U of Toledo&#8221; in 1932. Connelly also coached football, track, and boxing. He joined the UT faculty as a professor in 1926, where he remained until his death in 1955. Connelly loved to sing, but had never studied music. Apparently, previous fight songs were no longer in use, so he wrote the words for &#8220;U of Toledo&#8221; and sang the melody to a family friend, Bernie Jones. Jones played it on the piano and put it to music. The tune remained largely unchanged until 1975, when UT associate professor of music David Jex arranged the current version.<br>

=========================<br>
The intolerant past had nothing to do with slavery. The South was intolerant of having to pay the lion&rsquo;s share of the taxes while the North paid less. The Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. The South seceded because they were tired of supporting the whims of the congress.</p>
<p>Taxpayers in the US need to take a lesson from those Rebels. We support everyone in this country, including BO who spends like money is water.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You take back on that slave mentality,&rdquo; said Moss, who is black. &ldquo;I know the South won&rsquo;t rise again and the South can&rsquo;t rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The South has not risen again in about 144 years, perhaps because the need to rise again has not been as dire as it is now. Currently, the only politically correct focus of bigotry is Southern culture; even fundamentalist Islam suffers fewer slings and arrows than Southern culture.  Note the following facts: the Stars and Stripes flew over a slave nation for about 90 years before the Confederacy was even an idea; slavery was present in both the North and the South; slave ships sailed out of NORTHERN ports; most individuals in the South were NOT slave owners; indentured and Shanghaied individuals, kidnapped from England, were treated far worse, as  a rule, than slaves; and there were more abolitionists in the South than in the North.  Slavery ended more than 140 years ago, GET OVER IT.  If an individual doesn&rsquo;t like Southern culture, said individual should not live in the South.  If someone doesn&rsquo;t like the Confederate Battle flag (or other Confederate flags), then he or she should neither own one nor look at one.  Although I now live in the Northeast (for the moment), I am inspired to buy the biggest Confederate flag I can lay my hands on; not in the name of hatred, but in the name of heritage.</p>

		<p>Things like this make me ashamed to be a native of Oxford.</p>
<p>When the Union army came through Oxford, they burnt the town to the ground, so I feel like a little chanting is justified because town and university are still around. Remember, the US flag flew over slavery far longer than the Confederate flag.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The University of Mississippi has shortened one of its fight songs to discourage football fans from chanting &ldquo;the South will rise again&rdquo; during part of the tune, which critics say is an offensive reminder of the region&rsquo;s intolerant past.&#8221;</p>
<p>     If only we could &#8220;rise again&#8221;; it is my greatest wish. I fear the South is becoming more like the North and we are losing our regional flavor. I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day they banned our beloved freedom flag and the Colonel Rebel at Ole&rsquo; Miss. They live on in our hearts. </p>

		<p>As the daughter of a member of Daughters of Union Vets, I hope the South does rise again.  Or at least the ideology.</p>

		<p>  Who was the black civil rights leader who said way back in the early seventies that the South was on it&rsquo;s third reconstruction ? Something Jordon ? I can&rsquo;t remember his first name . I still have the old news magazine somewhere . It would appear we are now on our 6th or 7th reconstruction . It&rsquo;s hard for me to see how we can survive it all . They now have our children and have completely indoctrinated them . It&rsquo;s outrageous what the South has been put through . Even more outrageous what Oxford, Mississippi has been put through time and again . But I fear we are going down for the count this time . For those Northern conservatives who actually side with us, I thank you from the bottom of my southern heart . You are wise, because you know when the liberals get through with us they will turn their attention back to those non-southerners who refuse to assimilate into their multi-cult slumgullion stew . </p>

		<p>Ole Miss is Goody-Two-Shoes Central.  &#8220;Embrace the Orthodoxy&#8221; should be the school motto.  I think far too many students&rsquo; narcissistic self-images are of Genteel and LIBERAL Gentlefolk&hellip;.the creme of the Old South&hellip;above the racist masses.  After all; Liberalism is the new Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Bourbon and cigarettes are far more important to that bunch than solidarity with the South of their ancestors.  Not an eyebrow was raised when Khayat was installed.  The fraternities will let in ANYTHING whose posterior looks good in khakis (the sororities are still tough to get into), as long as he can pay the dues and is willing to become an alcoholic.</p>
<p>If this sounds to you like the classic profile of a SPLC lawyer, then you&rsquo;re getting my point.</p>

		<p>Southern pride is alive and well at Ole Miss, thank God!</p>
<p>It is inaccurate to say &#8216;The South Will Rise Again&rsquo; because, for those of us in succeeding generations who survived the War of Northern Aggression, we were never defeated. Our very lives today are a testament to this fact.</p>
<p>Ole Miss as an institution has so much to be proud of, particularly in reference to their valor at Gettysburg:<br>
Marching through an open field one mile long with General Lewis Armistead leading the way, the University Greys, made up entirely of students from Ole Miss, managed to plant their colors no more than a yard from the Union line before the devastating Union fire killed every last one of them.</p>
<p>I was not priviledged to fight in that war, but I am fighting in this cultural war&hellip;my hope is that every right-thinking Southerner will stand up and be proud of what others lived and died for, something no amount of political correctness can ever change.</p>
