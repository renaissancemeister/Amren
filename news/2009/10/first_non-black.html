<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33317396/ns/us_news-race_and_ethnicity/">First Non-Black Miss Hampton U Says Sorry</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first non-black winner of the annual beauty pageant at historically black Hampton University says she&rsquo;s sorry for writing a letter to President Barack Obama contending her crowning was not &#8220;widely accepted&#8221; on campus because she is not black.</p>
<p>Nikole Churchill, 22, a senior nursing major from Hawaii who attends the Virginia Beach campus, won the 15th annual Miss Hampton U scholarship pageant on Friday. She beat out nine black students.</p>
<p>Two days after her crowning, she wrote a letter to Obama, describing the crowning as &#8220;the best night of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she added: &#8220;With that being said, I am sad to say that my crowning was not widely accepted and many negative comments regarding my win have been shared throughout my campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be much easier to say that possibly some were not accepting of the news because I wasn&rsquo;t the most qualified contestant; however, the true reason for the disapproval was because of the color of my skin. I am not African American. &#8220;</p>
<p>She appealed to the president, who is black and was born in Hawaii, to come to Hampton University &#8220;so that my fellow Hamptonians can stop focusing so much on the color of my skin and doubting my abilities to represent, but rather be proud of the changes our nation is making towards accepting diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Campus split</b></p>
<p>Journalism sophomore Juan Diasgranados told the Daily Press that students were split on Churchill&rsquo;s crowning, with some saying her win embodies HU&rsquo;s spirit of diversity and others complaining that she&rsquo;s not black and doesn&rsquo;t attend the main campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re saying that people don&rsquo;t know who she is, people don&rsquo;t even see her, so how can she represent us if she&rsquo;s not even from the main campus?&#8221; Diasgranados told the newspaper.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Churchill, who said her father is from Guam and her mother is Italian, issued a statement through the university apologizing for the wording of her letter to Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have now come to regret writing this letter and disappointing the very students that I now represent. I took the comments of a few and blew it out of proportion,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Yes, she now has her mind &#8220;right.&#8221;  She now knows that it isn&rsquo;t possible to treat blacks like anything but children, because they react by throwing temper tantrums and resorting to violence.</p>
<p>Now she plays the &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend&#8221; blacks are adults game and notes that it was she who made such a despicable reaction, (To hundreds of blacks who are racist to the core and DEMANDED a black queen, not the pro-black blacks themselves.)</p>
<p>Onward and upward she goes, now qualified to enter society at large by playing the game in which she ignorantly was unaware of before this debacle.</p>
<p>Next week I expect her to come out and apologize for being so &#8220;racist.&#8221;  And I expect one of the ghetto rappers will take it upon himself to teach her to be more tolerant and less racist than she obviously is.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he&rsquo;ll chant one of his most memorable classics about offing the honkies and killing the pigs, &#8220;cuz even that ain&rsquo;t enuf payback for 400 years of oppression and slavery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Churchill, who said her father is from Guam and her mother is Italian&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Quite frankly any(presumably)white girl that chooses, of all the world&rsquo;s institutions of higher learning, a &#8220;historically black&#8221; university to attend, is pretty much hopelessly deluded and foolish in the extreme to begin with. Can she honestly be surprised by the cold reception to her victory? God, these kids really are brainwashed through and through!     </p>

		<p>Historically black Universities are a complete joke the first two years. I should know I got my BA from one. </p>
<p>They pretend to be land grant or historically black while cleaning out the inner city areas of St. Louis or Chicago or (insert city here) just to make the freshman class a higher percentage of black.</p>
<p>They then use all the activity fee&rsquo;s of the mostly white local students to invite speakers like Faracon or Alex Haley etc and have big dollar rap artists in for the campus parties. Its really a sweet deal for the few blacks who attend&hellip;at least for the year or so they are there before academic probation forces them out and the homecomings bring blacks from all across the nation to celebrate with drugs and shootings.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the upper level 300 - 400 courses it is usually 98% white with the occasional (usually female) black student. BUT they sure have fun spending that money and I can assure you the black female students keep a tight leash on the white girls to keep them from becoming homecoming queen or what have you.</p>
<p>Of course my experience is several years old now so I imagine it is much harder for the black girls to keep the white girls out now. As a matter of fact I had a few black female friends from my upper level classes and they were the intelligent ones who often told me pointedly that black women suffer from diversity more than white men in alot of areas and they had some valid points.</p>
<p>I often think if we could keep those students from my last year or so of my undergrad days and get rid of all the others diversity would be a very pleasant thing.</p>

		<p>See her picture here:<br>
</p>
<p>She could be half Guamanian Chamorro is the proper demonym according to Wikipedia.  But apparently there is also 10% of their rather tiny population that is White, and descendent from Spaniards and also American soldiers who have been stationed there.  It&rsquo;s possible that she&rsquo;s Spanish and Italian, and thus fully White.  She definitely has dark hair but her skin isn&rsquo;t too dark, so I think that may be the case.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I overheard a conversation between two co-workers, one white and one black. </p>
<p>The black guy was telling the white guy that his son was going to Morehouse&hellip;which he then described as an Ivy League school. I almost fell on the floor laughing!</p>
<p>I have to agree with HH #5. HBCUs are a joke, on so many levels, not the least of which is how people can take any black seriously when they scream racism at supposedly pro-white, &#8220;exclusionary&#8221; institutions. </p>
<p>Whites can&rsquo;t have their own swim club, but blacks can have their own universities. Huh?</p>

<p><br>
Well I do not know about ALL of them but I am very familiar with a few and yes they were almost totally white colleges after the freshman year.</p>
<p>The drop out rate for the backs was insane. The HBCU&rsquo;s had to take the bottom of the barrel when recruiting blacks and then bring them to an area that was almost totally white and not all that populated. The University I got my BA from was almost totally funded by local whites taking classes there and I know there were a few other land grant colleges that had the same issues the one I went to had.</p>
<p>If the blacks had any intelligence and drive they were soon recruited into the larger more respected universities to fill the AA quota&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to believe me I will gladly send you some scans of a year book or 3&hellip; By the Junior year the classes were 90-98% white.</p>
<p>Again I will add that my experience was about 15 years ago but I drive by there and I know a few students (in fact I work with one) and they tell me it hasn&rsquo;t changed. As for the other land grant colleges I traveled to in Oklahoma and Arkansas I have no current info on.</p>

		<p> &#8220;However there was quite a bit of annoyance at her being selected. Racism? <br>
She wrote a letter to the President BHO criticizing her detractors. <br>
She has issued a formal apology for writing the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
She has <i> apologized </i>for objecting to the harassment of her detractors? <br>
Pathetic.</p>
<p>True white behavior!</p>
