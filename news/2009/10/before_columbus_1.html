			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Legrand H. Clegg II, Norman Givran (blog)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every October Americans pause to celebrate Columbus Day. Children are taught that the Italian navigator discovered America. Parades are held in his honor and tributes tell of his skill, courage and perseverance.</p>
<p>However, no so called euro educators want to tell the real story of thr murderer rapist, and slave master and greedy deciever..i will do it for u</p>
<p>Historians, archeologists, anthropologists and other scientists and scholars now know that Columbus did not discover America. Not only were native Americans present when he reached the New World, but also Africans, Asians and Europeans, among others, had been sailing to the Americas thousands of years before Columbus ventured across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Of the various people who reached America before Columbus, Black Africans appear to have made the most contacts and to have had the greatest impact. During the 19th and 20th centuries, several scholars wrote books and articles about this subject and urged the academic establishment to change primary and secondary curricula across the country to reflect the great contributions of African people to early America. Unfortunately, such pleas fell on deaf ears; so again this October our children are being taught the myth that Columbus discovered America.</p>
<p>In August of this year, a group of 13 African Americans participated in a study-tour of numerous Mexican archeological sites. Led by the renowned Black historian and architect, Mathu Otir, and two Mexican guides, we visited numerous museums, temples, pyramids and cities, most of which reflected the genius of the native American Mayas and Aztecs. Toward the end of the tour, in southern Mexico, we began to see the remains of an ancient Black presence.</p>
<p>Evidence of the early Africans is widespread and varied. Dozens of majestic stone heads have been found at ancient sacred sites, such as La Venta and Tres Zapotes in southern Mexico (See photograph). Ranging up to 9 feet and 4 inches in height, with a circumference of 22 feet, and weighing 30 to 40 tons, these colossal statues depict helmeted Black men with large eyes, broad fleshy noses and full lips. They appear to represent priest-kings who ruled vast territories in the ancient New World from provinces near the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>In the holy city of La Venta, dating back to at least 1500 BC, four of these large stone heads were discovered on a ceremonial platform featuring a miniature step pyramid and a conical pyramid  &mdash;  the earliest of such monuments to appear in the Americas.</p>
<p>Other art-work also serves as evidence of Africans in America before Columbus. For years the late art historian, Alexander Von Wuthenau, collected ancient clay figurines that provide clues regarding the diversity of America&rsquo;s pre-Columbian population. His remarkable African collection depicts priests, chiefs, dancers, wrestlers, drummers, beautiful women and stately men  &mdash;  a collage of Black people who occupied every stratum of society from Mexico to South America.</p>
<p>Negroid skulls and skeletons have also been found throughout the New World. Polish professor Andrzej Wiercinski has revealed the discovery of African skulls at Olmec sites in Tlatilco, Cerro de las Mesas and Monte Alban. Furthermore, very ancient African skeletons have been unearth in California, Mexico, Central and South America.</p>
<p>The best evidence of the Black presence in America before Columbus comes from the pen of the &#8220;great discoverer&#8221; himself. In his Journal of the Second Voyage, Columbus reported that when he reached Haiti the native Americans told him that black-skinned people had come from the south and southeast in boats, trading in gold-tipped medal spears. At least a dozen other European explorers, including Vasco Nunez de Balboa, also reported seeing or hearing of &#8220;Negroes&#8221; when they reached the New World.</p>
<p>Nicholas Leon, an eminent Mexican authority, recorded the oral traditions of his people. Some of them reported that &#8220;the oldest inhabitants of Mexico were blacks[T]he existence of blacks and giants is commonly believed by nearly all the races of our sail and in their various language they had words to designate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early Mexican scholars were convinced that the impact of the Black explorers on the New World was profound and enduring. One author, J.A. Villacorta, has written: &#8220;Any way you view it, Mexican civilization had its origin in Africa.&#8221; Modern excavations throughout Latin America appear to confirm Villacorta&rsquo;s conclusions.</p>
<p>The Olmec civilization, which appears to have been of African origin or to have been dominated by Africans, was the Mother Culture of Mexico. Of this, Michael Coe, the leading American historian on Mexico, has written that, &#8220;there is not the slightest doubt that all later civilizations in [Mexico and Central America], rest ultimately on an Olmec base.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ivan Van Sertima, the foremost authority on the African presence in ancient America, has built a strong case demonstrating that many Olmec cultural traits were of African origin: &#8220;A study of the Olmec civilization reveals elements that so closely parallel ritual traits and techniques in the Egypto-Nubian world of the same period that it is difficult to maintain [that] all these are due to mere coincidence.&#8221; Other scholars believe that Africans introduced a calendar, writing, pyramid and tomb construction, mummification, as well as certain political systems and religious traditions to the native Americans.</p>
<p>Who were the Africans who sailed to America before Columbus? Indian scholar R.A. Jairazbhoy states that the earliest settlers were Ancient Egyptians led by King Ramesis III, during the 19th dynasty. Van Sertima also believes that most of the explorers sailed from Egypt, but during the much later 25th dynasty. Many other scholars insist that the navigators came from West African nations, such as Ghana, Mali and Songhay</p>
<p>Whoever these Black people were, they most certainly sailed to America in ancient and medieval times and left a profound imprint on New World soil. As Jairazbhoy notes: &#8220;The black began his career in America not as slave but as master.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our Mexican guides agreed. As we ended our tour and prepared to return to the U.S., one of them proclaimed: &#8220;I would like to thank the African people for bringing civilization to the New World.&#8221; It is high time for the American media and academic establishment to admit the same.</p>

		<p>A good number of years ago, scrolling the radio dial for something interesting to listen to, I came across a black female guest speaking on Coast to Coast AM. </p>
<p>This was a first. As I had never before heard a black person tell of her experiences with aliens, I listened. </p>
<p>This woman, and her sister as well, claimed to have extensive experience with aliens, space travel, and astronomy.</p>
<p>It was all quite interesting. These ladies even sounded as though they really believed their tall tales.</p>
<p>They even claimed that &#8220;the population of Mars is predominately black&#8221;! And that&rsquo;s a direct quote.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Not only did blacks discover the New World, they were also pioneering space colonizers as well!</p>
<p>(Since the temperature on Mars can fall as low as -220F, perhaps these Afro-Martians could be called the ultimate &#8220;Ice People&#8221;)</p>

		<p>That such utterly specious nonsense could receive wide circulation beggars belief.</p>
<p>Pray tell, what happened to these wide-ranging advanced black African civilizations, which have vanished without the merest trace, with no written language, no ruins, no artifacts, and not even any widely disseminated legends?</p>

It&rsquo;s not inconceivable that Africans were blown and carried on currents to the New World.</p>
<p>The difference is was it planned or an accident.</p>
<p>Columbus made the journey armed with knowledge, plans, and technology to go back and forth. This is far different from being in a boat on the African coast and being swept away by currents.</p>
<p>True exploration is founded in planning, knowledge, and insight. It&rsquo;s not happenstance or accidents of winds and currents.</p>
<p>Also, if the argument holds, blacks can&rsquo;t claim to have &#8216;discovered&rsquo; the New World either.</p>

<p>Why is it that those who say they are reincarnated were all princes and princesses in their past lives?   This laughable nonsense does make one important point though,  all the hand-wringing over white imperialism is a moral fraud.  The author obviously is proud of blacks allegedly lording it over the natives.   And you never hear Mexicans or Liberals who complain about whites stealing land from Mexico ask how the Mexicans got it in the first place.  </p>

		<p>My response is what I have told coworkers and subordinates: Don&rsquo;t tell me how good you were, show me how good you are. Africans in Africa are sitting on vast resources, they should use these great abilities to exploit them. Why do they need to import Asians and Whites, when with proper training, the native Africans could do it themselves? In South African, Africans took over a technologicly modern state, the results are not impessive.</p>

<p>Blacks have zero history of accomplishments, having lived a stone-age existence for thousands of years, so the only way they can claim credit for anything is to lie about it.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is their stories are so far-fetched nobody believes them but the biggest fools on planet earth, part of which are the Obama supporters.</p>

<p>I read it up to that point, then stopped. If the author (in the loosest sense of the word) decides to regress to the level of using internet shorthand in their article, they have lost my attention completely. Sorry, but net lingo does not a scholarly article make.</p>
<p>Yes, Christopher Columbus, by the definition of the word, DID discover America. This is very irritating to have to point this out when liberals continue to have the typical knee-jerk reaction to Columbus Day by blurting out &#8220;Columbis did nat disover Amerca!!!&#8221;. These folks need to look up &#8220;discover&#8221; in a dictionary and they will find it fits everything that Columbus did when he landed in the Bahamas:</p>
<p>1. 	to see, get knowledge of, learn of, find, or find out; gain sight or knowledge of (something previously unseen or unknown)</p>
<p>He simply wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, however. He wasn&rsquo;t even the first European to do so as Leif Ericsson landed at Newfoundland hundreds of years earlier. Yet he envisioned it as it had eventually become by 1776 and finally morphed into what it is now today. Before him, America as an entity did not even exist. It was merely a large mass of land and islands inhabited by warring and tribes of which little to no unity existed among them.</p>

		<p>This is all true, as we all know!</p>
<p>However, the most advanced black civilization started in Iceland, 20,000 BC, which spread its culture throughout the world.</p>
<p>It taught the Chinese to come down from the trees and open laundries and restaurants.</p>
<p>The uncivilized South and Central America people were taught the art of bus boys and lawn care.</p>
<p>In Europe they had their biggest success, teaching the peasants, mathematics, physics, architecture, sculpture, classical music composition, philosophy, painting and epic writing. All these vestiges from black civilization can still be seen in Europe today.</p>
<p>But alas, Viking cannibals came to Iceland and ate all the poor black people-don&rsquo;t believe me????, well I heard it from Minister Louis Farrakhan and the other black scholars!</p>

		<p>With pyramids being found in Mexico it wouldn&rsquo;t surprize me if Egyptions traveled there, but for one ..the Egyptions are known to be caucasian. Either way Columbus Did Discover America for us and whatever these antiwhite propagandists say will not change the fact that white nations the world over are the most evolved with the highest standards of living. These propagandists are magicians trying to convince us not to trust what common sense tells us,&hellip; and again&hellip; since the blacks are such true  (in these peoples eyes)they shouldn&rsquo;t need our second rate assistance in Africa or Detroit. Concerning Rape.. I think on Amren we know the blacks are on record for some 37000 rapes against white women in America in a single year with the reverse, white on black rape something close to zero*</p>

		<p>If black Africans were the founders of all great civilizations, ideas, and major innovations, then why are they at the bottom of the world&rsquo;s food chain? Afrocentrists generally have trouble reconciling &#8220;black African superiority&#8221; with their current inferior status. What&rsquo;s next? Let me guess, black Africans also ran China, Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, and other great non-black civilizations. Even ancient Egypt wasn&rsquo;t a black empire, as confirmed by most Egyptologists. Going back to the whole notion of black African superiority, how could such a mighty, educated, and courageous race allow themselves to be subjugated by us inferior white Europeans? I eagerly await an answer from an afrocentrist. </p>

		<p>Whatever!   So Clegg has black men ruling the world in his &lsquo;award winning&rsquo; video, in some undefined antiquity.  Now the blacks are handed a smoothly functioning city (Detroit, East St. Louis etc.) complete with all the required facilities and institutions and they can run into the ground in two or three generations.  Now the blacks are handed a smoothly functioning country (Zimbabwe, South Africa) with vast resources, infrastructure and institutions of governance and they can create basket cases in two or three generations.  I&rsquo;m no fan of evolution but if I were I would have to conclude that the black race is devolving, rather than evolving.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many other scholars insist that the navigators came from West African nations, such as Ghana, Mali and Songhay.<br>
Whoever these Black people were, they most certainly sailed to America in ancient and medieval times and left a profound imprint on New World soil. As Jairazbhoy notes: &ldquo;The black began his career in America not as slave but as master.�?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Alright then, but  I have a question.   If Africans  had the ships and technology to be able to sail all the way across the Atlantic to the New World, then how come none of them ever made it to Europe which was so much closer? Or India? China?  Where were their ships? Why was there no commerce?  Why are there no historical records?   Where is the archaeological or demographic evidence?   (Surely there would be some evidence left behind attesting to their presence.)</p>
<p>And where were those ocean-going ships and  advanced technology when European explorers eventually came to THEM?  The Portuguese explorers found nothing but primitiveness and savagery.   If black Africans were so advanced, why were they so easy to enslave? &hellip; a fact remarked on even by non-Europeans, such as ancient Arab travelers. Something does not fit.<br>

		<p>The simple and obvious question is that if blacks had advanced ships and navigation many thousands of years ago, then why did they regress and apparently lose it all?<br>
 - If you make a study of the history of technological development since the stone age, one fact always asserts itself - that once an improved and useful technology has been developed iy is, historically, never lost.This is because its utility is too precious to be thrown away.Think of metals, the wheel, horse domestification, textiles etc all of which are exceedingly ancient.</p>

		<p>So Columbus did not discover it because indians already lived there, but blacks did discover it when indians lived there. This double sided stuff has to have a base in black genetics. Also the indians thought whites were gods because their religion stated that white gods that came from the sea gave them civilization. </p>

		<p>Thor Heyerdahl sailed across the Atlantic in boats made of papyrus to show it could be done but not very safely. Possibly Egyptians did take some ideas about building to South and Central America, but Egyptians even now are not the same as black Africans. They had Nubian slaves that they would have taken with them for menial labour, but not as architects or designers or innovators. In any case, these African immigrants left no record, whereas Columbus did. If revisionists want to develop a non-Eurocentric history, especially non-European apologists, then let them bring in the same sorts of evidence that historians and historiographers have used since Herodotos introduced the term history into the study of the past, where the verb histein means to examine, as opposed to speculate or to mythologise or to glorify.</p>
<p>In any case, whoever went before Columbus, he was the first European who left a definite record of his voyages and of his painstaking research and dogged persistence. It was only Europeans who had the courage, intellectual curiosity and technical innovation that allowed them to venture onto the open sea and search for a New World, just as now it&rsquo;s only Europeans who make serious attempts to strike out into exploration of the universe. The rest make pathetic attempts to follow. But perhaps in a thousand years-or this month-there will be revisionists who try to conflate the space explorers and to deny Western achievement there, too.</p>
<p>Unlike migrants from earlier eras, Columbus and his contemporaries did not seek a new place to live, desperately striking out to escape some menace. These explorers went in quest of knowledge to take back with them to their homes. That they also sought wealth does not denigrate their unique achievement. Their successors, like James Cook and William Bligh, were even more disinterested; there were also no non-Europeans prominent at all in the history of navigational exploration.<br>

		<p>Had technologically advanced (relatively speaking) blacks reached America long ago, they would have exterminated all the natives in their path - just as they did in Africa to the Pygmies and Khoisan.  By the time Europeans reached America, they would then have found only blacks living here.  As for the giant heads with &#8220;black&#8221; features.  It is not uncommon for Native Americans to have similar features in some areas but they were not black.  As for the traditions of &#8220;blacks&#8221; having been earlier inhabitants, it is common for any darker skinned people to be called &#8220;black&#8221; - but this does not mean they were African black.  Blacks couldn&rsquo;t even make it to Madagascar - just off the coast of Africa - and this blogger wants us to believe they reached America on their own?  Give me a break.</p>

		<p>Two points:<br>
The ancient mesoamerican ball game ullamaliztli (pronounced &#8220;hoops&#8221;) bears a stunning simlarity to to a modern court, hoop and ball game still played as far away as Detroit. Even the post game treatment of the losing team jumps out and screams African.  Yes, goal orientation! Further examintion of the evidence of Bantu influence reveals that some communities progessed to the elimination of the hole in the hoop entirely, proceeding directtly to the after game interaction with the losing team.<br>
Tragically the sail was stolen, and in fact removed from the Bantu cultue, temporarily disconecting these fascinating people from their fabulous heritage of building and exploration.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Mexican Civilization had its origins in Africa&#8221;. I am sure there will be more than one Latino and/or Hispanic public figure who take issue with that.

&ldquo;The simple and obvious question is that if blacks had advanced ships and navigation many thousands of years ago, then why did they regress and apparently lose it all?�?</p>
<p>This Question, or its analogue regarding African origin of European civilization, is not new, and the obvious answer should be well understood by now. </p>
<p>The following quote attributed to Al Shaprton helps make the situation clearer: &ldquo;White folks was in caves while we was building empires&hellip; We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it.�?  </p>
<p>It is clear that intellectual property works differently with Africans than with people of other races. Marco Polo &ldquo;stole�? the technique for making pasta from the Chinese and his theft enabled the Italians to make pasta primavera.  It did not, however, prevent the Chinese from making pork lo mein. (Visit your local Chinese carry-out to confirm this.)  The pasta-making technique was simply no longer the exclusive possession of the Chinese.  But with Africans, theft of intellectual property is like the theft of your car; you no longer have use of the vehicle.   Even worse, your records at the DMV are obliterated as well.  So when some knowledge-hungry Greek wandered into Africa to satisfy his hunger and learned philosophy at the foot of an unnamed witch-doctor, then took his newly learned techniques back to his fellow &ldquo;Greek homos,�? the Africans did not remain in possession of their shared lore but it became as inaccessible to them as a stolen car. </p>
<p>Simple, eh?  </p>

An excellent and obvious question!  Also, why is it that there are no clear remains of those civilizations anywhere today? None!  They have totally vanished,  except for some decaying and highly questionable mere shards and remnants with a vague resemblance to blacks (allegedly), upon which he bases the assumption of an entire civilization. That&rsquo;s grasping at straws. There would have to be more solid proof than what amounts to obvious fantasy and  wishful thinking.</p>
<p>And if there was contact from Africa, there would been two-way commerce.  Where are there in black Africa any finds of New World pottery, weapons, animals, plants, anything?  Surely, those venturesome black explorers brought something  back with them?   (Just as Columbus most definitely did!)</p>

<p>Absolutely right.  And I might add, there&rsquo;s not much that isn&rsquo;t far-fetched and just plain dumb that they DON&rsquo;T believe in, in  addition to these inane things.</p>
<p>For example, whites introduced aids and drugs into their neighborhoods to kill them off; the government (They mean whites) blew up the levees in N.O. to kill off the blacks there.  Angel food cake and Devil&rsquo;s Food cake are racist terms, just as referring to a &#8220;black hole&#8221; in space is racist.</p>
<p>Their stupidity and total lack of any real mental abilities would be laughable if these people were not treated as prima donnas of the empire&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>No nation on earth with such a large number of blacks can endure on a competitive level, unless they&rsquo;re marginalized somehow, and they are taught, work, and live apart from the general population.</p>
<p>The radical scheme is to encourage integration with whites in order to upgrade the gene pool, however, it would take more than a hundred years to nudge enough propagandized white fools to have an effect on their group I.Q.&rsquo;s and there is no way this empire is going to exist for that length of time.  </p>
<p>At some point this kind of integrated population is certain to erupt into violence or be overtaken by war or economic forces from a superior nation that will cause its numbers to dwindle drastically.</p>
<p>The best bet, however, is that civil war will act as Mother Nature&rsquo;s culling tool to right this freak population, so that it is again in sync with nature and Darwin&rsquo;s theory of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>In other words, something will occur to destroy this empire, whether it is internal eruption due to anti-human nature policies or outside forces that will takeover from a dumbed down populace that can no longer effectively compete on the world stage.</p>
