<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091009/US.Black.Male.Teachers/">Nation&rsquo;s Pupils Find Few Black Men to Call Mister</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathy Matheson, Comcast News, October 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lenny Macklin made it to 10th grade before having a teacher who looked like him  &mdash;  an African-American male. Gregory Georges graduated from high school without ever being taught by a black man.</p>
<p>Only about 2 percent of teachers nationwide are African-American men. But experts say that needs to change if educators expect to reduce minority achievement gaps and dropout rates.</p>
<p>Macklin, now an 18-year-old college student, said he understands the circle that keeps many of his peers out of the classroom professionally.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of males, they don&rsquo;t like being in school because they can&rsquo;t relate to their teacher,&#8221; said Macklin, of Pittsburgh. &#8220;So why would you want to work there?&#8221;</p>
<p>American teachers are overwhelmingly white (87 percent) and female (77 percent), despite minority student populations of about 44 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a job men generally avoid because of gender stereotypes, fear of abuse accusations and low pay, said Bryan Nelson, founder of the Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization MenTeach. The average U.S. teacher salary was about $51,000 in 2006-07.</p>
<p>Yet increasing the number of minority teachers is important because of &#8220;the role model factor,&#8221; said Greg Johnson, a policy analyst for the National Education Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MISTER is both an acronym  &mdash;  Mentors Instructing Students Toward Effective Role Models  &mdash;  and a reference to the 1967 film &#8220;In the Heat of the Night,&#8221; in which Sidney Poitier&rsquo;s character demands respect with the line, &#8220;They call me MISTER Tibbs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Designed to put more minority men at the head of the classroom, the initiative offers scholarships in exchange for teaching in public schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To improve the national percentage of black male teachers to even 3 percent, another 45,000 would need to enroll.</p>
<p>One hurdle may be that the program is found mostly at historically black colleges and universities, which have lower graduation rates than colleges overall, according to an Associated Press analysis. Men at those schools have a paltry 29 percent graduation rate within six years, in part due to lack of money and poor academic preparation, the AP found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayward Jean, 27, has found teaching equally inspiring, though not without its challenges. Now in a low-income district in Orangeburg, S.C., Jean said he was caught off guard by the initially chilly reception from boys in his class.</p>
<p>Many are being raised by single mothers and are wary of black men abruptly entering and leaving their lives, Jean said.</p>

		<p>I am a white male teacher, and I have found it exceedingly difficult to connect with black male students on any level.  If a black male teacher can improve the test scores and classroom behavior of young black makes, I fully support this effort.</p>

		<p>The Liberals must be running out of excuses for Black male non-achievement in schools. They&rsquo;ve used forced integration, magnet schools, voluntary segregation, smaller classes, reduced academic standards, etc.; all to negligible positive effect. Now they claim that there is a lack of Black males in teaching, and this is preventing Black male students from being as well behaved as Asian females, and have the academic achievements of Asian males. I don&rsquo;t think so. In fact, I believe this is another lame excuse.</p>
<p>Actually, I had several Black male teachers back in the 1950&rsquo;s. They got no greater respect from the Black male students, nor did they stimulate them to better grades than other teachers. The simple fact is that with Affirmative Action, Black men who would be good teachers enter more lucrative occupations, i.e. law, medicine, presidency, drug dealing, public relations, etc.<br>

		<p>Let me just see if I got those facts straight. 71% of the 30% that do not drop out of high school drop out of college. That leaves 8 out of 100. And now they want them to teach?</p>

If it&rsquo;s so critical for a black male child to have a black male teachers as a role model, is it critical for a white male child to have a white male teacher as a role model?</p>
<p>On a local black radio talk show, the host interviewed a black female teacher about the low numbers of black teachers (male and female). She gave him a blunt answer he didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>She said most blacks don&rsquo;t go into the teaching field because they know how &#8216;kids&rsquo; behave.<br>

		<p>I would wager more black teachers would exacerbate the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;. </p>
<p>Most white teachers I had were immensely dedicated and concerned about their students, and while I don&rsquo;t think I ever had a black teacher, if they tend to be anything remotely as surly and lazy as the multitudes of other black government employees, I think their students are in trouble.</p>

		<p>Oh just have those black boys watch T.V. where EVERY black man is a teacher, judge, doctor, lawyer, astonaut, pilot- - all at the same time,  an all around pillar of the community who all the White people go to for advice. That should do it.  </p>

		<p>Typical faulty logic at work. We are to assume that blacks would finish high school in greater numbers if barriers are removed and crutches are supplied. In this article, the magic bullet is replacing existing teachers with black males. There is no attempt in the article to provide more than anecdotal evidence that this would make a difference, and no examination of the cost of recruiting black males as teachers. Instead, we are asked to support an expensive social experiment that is doomed to failure. Apparently, it is much easier to look for a magic bullet than to face the facts about the true cause of black underachievement. </p>

		<p>If anyone thinks that today&rsquo;s black students will show more respect to a black teacher, they&rsquo;re sadly mistaken. Today&rsquo;s black yoot shows respect to no one. They&rsquo;d just as soon cuss out and beat up anyone in authority over them, black or white.</p>

		<p>I have had a few African professors in my economics courses. They have been fairly good although their accents sometimes make it difficult to understand. Many of them have expressed the sentiment (in private) that Black Americans have a corrupt culture and don&rsquo;t understand how good they have it here compared to the hell hole that is Africa. I say we start a study abroad for Black students in Zimbabwe, maybe they will hate whitey a little less. Naaah who am I kidding?</p>

		<p>Too many blacks go to third rate state schools or historic black colleges where thorough education is absent and dropout rates are high. Black teachers are seen, correctly, as less qualified, than white teachers. And by whom?  Black students who may not study but who can tell a fake in a flash.</p>

		<p>Who cares what the excuse is? the latest one anyway. They never call for more black gas station attendants, or for that matter, more female garbage collectors, no matter how skewed these employment fields might be. It&rsquo;s just a one way ticket where some are more important than others perpetually.  </p>

<p>Sending me to Turkey made me a race realist, when before I was one of those liberal self-hating and unappreciative white women. Your idea is excellent, we should also send more self-hating liberal whites abroad. They don&rsquo;t listen to anyone, even ones who were converted like me after a real experience. </p>
<p>I would call this practical and valuable hands-on education.   </p>

		<p>Good black teachers don&rsquo;t want to teach a lot of black students:</p>
<p><i> &#8221; However, those black teachers who did leave black schools tended to be the highest qualified black teachers. So the decline in quality was somewhat more pronounced among black teachers than white teachers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Who can blame them?</p>

		<p>This actually isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.  Black students will definitely respond best to a Black teacher, especially a Black male who projects some authority and isn&rsquo;t very meek and wimpy&hellip;think Black males who have some experience in the military or in sports.</p>
<p>Most Blacks aren&rsquo;t overly intelligent and thus couldn&rsquo;t teach very many higher level courses in very technically complex topics like advanced math, science, and so on, but anyone of average intelligence can teach other easier subjects like history, literature, political science, physical education, agriculture, woodshop, and other similar subjects.</p>

		<p>19 Anon: Anyone of average intelligence can Not teach, not math, not history, not woodshop.  Perhaps they can stand before a class and regurgitate what they were told when they were in school, but that&rsquo;s not teaching.  One of the attractions of computer-based teaching is that it can easily mimic that &#8220;teacher&#8221; of average intelligence, providing lists of facts, hours of drill and grading it all instantly.  Kids are right to hate that kind of schooling.</p>
