<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=112243">Sunstein: Americans Too Racist for Socialism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Klein, WorldNetDaily, October 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. should move in the direction of socialism but the country&rsquo;s &#8220;white majority&#8221; opposes welfare since such programs largely would benefit minorities, especially blacks and Hispanics, argued President Obama&rsquo;s newly confirmed regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein.</p>
<p>&#8220;The absence of a European-style social welfare state is certainly connected with the widespread perception among the white majority that the relevant programs would disproportionately benefit African Americans (and more recently Hispanics),&#8221; wrote Sunstein.</p>
<p>The Obama czar&rsquo;s controversial comments were made in his 2004 book &#8220;The Second Bill of Rights,&#8221; which was obtained and reviewed by WND.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sunstein claims the &#8220;socialist movement&#8221; did not take hold in the U.S. in part because of a &#8220;smaller and weaker political left or lack of enthusiasm for redistributive programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A prominent theme throughout Sunstein&rsquo;s 39-page paper, entitled &#8220;Climate Change Justice&#8221; and reviewed by WND, maintains U.S. wealth should be redistributed to poorer nations. He uses terms such as &#8220;distributive justice&#8221; several times. The paper was written with fellow attorney Eric A. Posner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is even possible that desirable redistribution is more likely to occur through climate change policy than otherwise, or to be accomplished more effectively through climate policy than through direct foreign aid,&#8221; wrote Sunstein.</p>

		<p>I think he&rsquo;s literally right.  The irony of his being right, at least when comparing America to Europe, is that European socialism leans on the same kind of nationalism that Sunstein despises.  Note that states like Wisconsin and Minnesota, with their Scandinavian roots and sensibilities, have bigger, state-supplemented, welfare systems than the country as a whole.  And, until recently, they never had serious budget problems.</p>

		<p>Anything written by a black person that contains the word &#8220;justice&#8221; is almost sure to mean something punitive against White people, e.g. social justice, economic justice, environmental justice, etc.  The world has turned upside down when to resistance to funding your own ethnic displacement is a vice and not a virtue.  The welfare state creates a negative selection process that favors irresponsible people to the detriment of responsible producers.  It&rsquo;s unsustainable; eventually the takers outstrip society&rsquo;s ability to pay.  It&rsquo;s really that simple.</p>

		<p>I find this short article full of erroneous assumption on Sunstein&rsquo;s part.  Europe&rsquo;s social systems DO benefit minorities.  Socialism in general IS inclusive of all people, at least in principal.  A few places, like Slovenia have a very nationalistic population AND a social system.  I have lived there and I can bear witness to the extremes of their national feeling, even though it is non-agressive militarily.  Because they do not take in refugees and assylum seekers, their two million population remains largely ethnically Slovene.  Their government rewards the production of Slovenian children, even giving the men time off to bond with their babies.  The Slovenian example could be a model for any white population that wishes to preserve its particular identity.</p>
<p>Sunstien commits further glaring errors of assumption with the statement that the left is &#8220;small and weak.&#8221;  Even CNN is running a campaign advertising a Latino Special by claiming that minorities will soon be the majority.  We may have a history that predisposes racial selfishness, but it will be interesting to see how the new majority will feel about helping the increasingly poorer pool of whites via welfare programs.</p>
<p>The idea that Climate Change legislation is an opportunity for slipping in communistic manipulations in an effort to &#8220;redistribute American wealth&#8221; ought to be a clear indication that this man has no business in any public office, since his intentions cannot be trusted on any particular issue.</p>
<p>This is another blooper on Obama&rsquo;s part - or perhaps this is intentional.  It is if his intention is to subvert the nation.  Can&rsquo;t he imagine what a redistribution of wealth as Sunstein envisions would do to the economy, and not just the U.S.?  He may end up disqualifying himself for his own office, if he can&rsquo;t come up with appointees that demonstrate a little more honesty and American statesmanship than he has so far.</p>

		<p>Hmm the title of this article makes a blanket statement about a certain race of people. Sounds racist to me. I wish to make a rebuttal to the idea that white people dislike socialism because it benefits blacks and hispanics. I think that whites like capitalism because it benefits people who are hard working and educable. Too bad that too many blacks and hispanics are neither. Until very recently the only alternative to capitalism was a form of slavery. These days pay is based on merit. So if you work hard and educated yourself you could get rich. Socialism is even worse than slavery. Socialism does not even require you to work. Many blacks and hispanics prefer not to work but still expect a certain standard of living. While whites prefer to work and be compensated based on merit.</p>

		<p>I think he&rsquo;s clearly right.  People are more reluctant to work hard and be taxed to support people who are less related to them.  Places like Sweden and Norway are really extended families given how homogeneous they are.  That of course is changing with immigration.</p>

		<p>America is too racist for socialism says the guy who was appointed to his job by a black socialist president.</p>
<p>But I do agree with him however. I would be for all types of socialist programs if this was a white country with a shared work ethic and sense of values, not a heterogeneous stew of disgruntled and pampered &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; groups all fighting tooth and nail for their share of the handouts. </p>

<p>People understand that individuals care more for family members than for strangers. A race is just an extended family, and if caring less for members of a different race is unjust, then caring less for a stranger than for one&rsquo;s own child is also unjust.</p>
<p>The great irony is that Sunstein&rsquo;s statements are largely correct: America doesn&rsquo;t have universal health care and a strong social safety net because of its diversity. If the leftists really wanted to advance their agenda, they would do whatever they could to reduce the number of minorities in the U.S.<br>

<p>The problem with socialism is that is robs from the productive and responsible in the form of taxes and gives the unproductive and irresponsible money that they neither earned or are entitled to. Now if one is physically/mentally disabled, elderly etc., that is a different matter, they are entitled, but not healthy irresponsible people, no way!</p>

		<p>He is resentful, pure and simple.The world ain&rsquo;t exactly the way he wants it.Again, for the millionth time, the Chinese are going to run the show and this will be clear by mid century. They are completely ethnocentric and could give a rat&rsquo;s you-know-what about &#8220;minorities&#8221;. Considerations about the needs of the American system&rsquo;s underclass will be forgotten as the realities sink in. Maybe with some luck we will adopt the Chinese thinking and adopt ethnocentrism as a guiding principle. Europe will be overrun by Muslim maniacs and the idiocy of multiculturalism will be very clear. That continent will hardly serve as an example. If you want to survive as a nation you will adopt the Chinese model and push out the ethnic dissenters to their own land.</p>

		<p>One of the criticisms multiculturalists have of Western Civilization is that we are too ethnocentric and don&rsquo;t heed what other people in the world think. You know what? I absolutely agree! In foreign nations such as Japan, China, and other economically progressing Asian nations, people are very ethnocentric as Will suggests. They don&rsquo;t value diversity or equity for &#8220;oppressed minorities.&#8221; If only white Westerners would follow the example set by mostly homogenous Asian nations, then we might be able to breath freely again.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, if you are a racist &#8220;of course&#8221; you oppose any of Obama&rsquo;s programs, especially the ones that are socialist in nature.  I suppose that would include virtually all of his programs.</p>
<p>His statement also reflects the desire of the elites to increase diversity; i.e. reduce the percentage of whites thus diluting the powere of the only significant conservative voting block in this nation.</p>
<p>In effect, whites are being portrayed as the &#8220;kulaks&#8221; or &#8220;counter-revolutionaries&#8221; in 21st century America, impeding the revolution being spearheaded by the &#8220;people of color&#8221; and their leaders.</p>

		<p>Socialism is never viable in a multiracial society. Socialism has worked in Europe till now as most European nations are more than 90% White and hence they are all genetically related (i.e. they are family). As the number of genetic outsiders increase, people will be reluctant to share. And if you think Europeans alone are racist, go and ask some Afghan tribesmen if they would share their wealth with some Africans. What this idiot Sunstein does not realise is that as America becomes more and more multiracial, the prospect of Socialism will decrease.<br>
  <br>
   Race and genetic similarity aside, the United States of America were built on principles like the respect of private property, self reliance etc&hellip; which are incompatible with Socialism.<br>

		<p>But it cuts both ways.  The reasons blacks and hispanics take so much in welfare and other freebies is because they come from whites mostly.   Does anyone really believe they would be taking so much if they knew it all came from their own communities?  I doubt it.  Community leaders would make sure everyone knows the score and if you take this dollar then you hurt so and so down the street, etc. from your own kids and their schools, etc.  But since it comes from whitey, why not?  </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s quite right.  Why should we want even more of our tax money going to pay for our dispossession?  We have all seen how welfare given to blacks can destroy a city far more permanently than an atomic bomb (contrast Detroit with Hiroshima today).  Socialism barely works in overwhelmingly white countries, where people feel they are making a common sacrifice for their kinsmen.  It doesn&rsquo;t work at all in a multicultural country.  Watch Swedish socialism collapse as Muslims out breed the natives.<br>

		<p>And just one more thing to ponder: 95% of the 1.3 BILLION Chinese are the same ethnic group, the Han. Does anyone hear the word &#8220;dominant&#8221; when it comes to describing their attitude towards the world? Does anyone hear the word &#8220;submissive&#8221; when one describes the multiculturalist position?<br>
Also, there are more people with an IQ in the bright to gifted range in China than there are people in the United States. Kind of sobering.<br>

The honest and hardworking man reaps what he sows, the lazy and dishonest man reaps what he sows, etc. Simple cause and effect, basically. They are essentially like young teens in this respect (actually, in a long list of other respects too). They want all the benefits, with none of the work or responsibility.</p>

<p>Some people can do a LOT on very little formal training, and others can do a lot with considerable educational accomplishments.  But, this man exemplifies those who cannot seem to get it right and become lost in a morass of confusing idiocy the more they learn.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example of how skewed the thinking becomes in some white fools who seem to live in a world all of their own making.</p>
<p>People like him, should be given extensive psychotherapy, and, if he doesn&rsquo;t improve, he should be encouraged to work as a janitor, or at a car wash, and if he refuses to do both he should be threatened with committment in an asylum, if he ever again tries to push his psychodelic laced thoughts on the public.</p>

		<p> &#8220;A prominent theme throughout Sunstein&rsquo;s 39-page paper maintains that U.S. wealth should be redistributed to poorer nations. He uses terms such as &ldquo;distributive justice&rdquo; several times. The paper was written with fellow attorney Eric A. Posner.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
With these fellow &#8220;Americans&#8221; like Sunstein and Posner arguing for our dispossession, we do not need any external enemies.</p>

		<p>This Sunstein character is yet another extreme anti-white race hate-filled example of what&rsquo;s wrong with present-day America and the West in general, and what must be done to halt the Marxist Liberal inspired NWO agenda before the White world ceases to be altogether.</p>
<p>In the case of America, white secessation is the only answer along with DNA profiling self-financed at different cost levels based on ability to pay, of the white population within the ceded states for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>In Europe, a programme of mass deportation of non-native aliens and DNA profiling for the same reasons as that applicable to America would need to be also implemented.<br>

		<p>Well, wouldn&rsquo;t the &#8216;relevent programs&rsquo; disproportionately benefit blacks and Hispanics? Isn&rsquo;t that the point of them, to give to the undeserving? </p>
<p>Anonymous - &#8220;Without ties of blood and land, Scandinavian socialism cannot work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely! For this to work, everyone needs to play by the rules. Stangely enough, it worked just fine until the Scandinavian countries began to import selfish Muslims, Africans etc. who don&rsquo;t play by any rules except the &#8216;gimme freebies rule&rsquo;. And the more they get, the more they want.</p>
<p>Could be the reason why these cultures are such a mess.</p>

		<p>Why should one ethnic or racial voting block be able to vote to transfer the wealth of another to themselves? Whites correctly perceive the identity politics of the left and protect their interests. If we were to abandon identity politics it cannot be a unilateral decision and cannot be commanded by the people on the receiving end.</p>

		<p>Are you beginning to realize the so called black intelligentsia <br>
really are shallow thinking socialist having no sense of social justice and no respect for individual endeavor, much less freedom to pursue happiness?  Is it just me or do they harbor resentments and envy coupled with &#8220;payback&#8221; mentality towards any productive member of society?</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m right I only hope a few others see as well.</p>
<p>All of obama&rsquo;s friends are just like rev wright.  Lock in white folks, they want it all.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;The absence of a European-style social welfare state is certainly connected with the widespread perception among the white majority that the relevant programs would disproportionately benefit African Americans (and more recently Hispanics),&rsquo; wrote Sunstein&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the part left out:</p>
<p>&#8220;So therefore, with that in mind, he added, it would be far better to implement a Soviet-style totalitarian Central Government police state to manage the economy and health care, confiscate wealth and property from greedy Whites and give it to those more deserving  &mdash;  blacks, hispanics, Asians, recent immigrants those with historical grievances against oppressive, genocidal Whites.  It is time for the White man to pay for the evil he has caused to oppressed minorities in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the planned destruction of the economy  &mdash;  to prove Capitalism and Free Markets don&rsquo;t work, a powerful, unquestioned authoritarian government is being created  &mdash;  lorded over by obama and his czars (or so they think).  Hate speech laws will effectively end any criticism of of a government hell-bent on impoverishing and enslaving the population of the US.</p>

		<p>There is a half-truth to this. Swedes will pay 55% taxes becuase they are paying for Swedes. Same for Japanese or Dutch or Germans etc etc. The United States lacks a singular ethnicity and thus nationalist socialism, the only socialism that has ever worked, cannot exist here.</p>

		<p>Like most unelected czars this guy is chock-full of it. The global warming scam is finished. In the last week I&rsquo;ve read three articles in mainstream articles, including the ultra-liberal eco-loving BBC admitting that the planet is cooling. As is usual with the mainstream media liars, they just ain&rsquo;t shouting it from the rooftops. The welfare states he so admires in Europe are a huge millstone around people&rsquo;s necks that has seen mass immigration/multiculturalism being forced onto countries like the UK which is in currently in the process of financial meltdown (since March they&rsquo;ve been issuing money with no backing, quantitative easing) and vast amounts of third-world people all keen to live off the welfare system. The post-war cradle-to-grave welfare system was built for smaller homogeneous white populations where the vast amount of people were gainfully employed, not to be a conduit for the burgeoning third-world. It is unsustainable &amp; is on the brink of collapse. This Sunstein fellow ought to take himself to Africa &amp; attempt to build his socialist paradise there but then like Zimbabwe &amp; South Africa &amp; every other failed African state it will be in ruins before very long.</p>

		<p>Someone needs to clue this Sunstein fellow in on the unspoken secret about socialism &hellip; socialism and effective economic &#8216;redistribution&rsquo; is ONLY possible in racially homogeneous nations.  Multiracial nations are just too chaotic and competitive to ever become socialistically inclined.</p>

		<p>I have to admit, Sunstein is very forthcoming on viewing socialisim as wealth redistribution and as favoring minorities over whites. So the question is, why do whites put up with any of this, at all??</p>
