<h1>Residents Get Chance at Stimulus Money</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Click on Detroit, October 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit&rsquo;s homeless and low-income residents have another opportunity for a chance at millions of stimulus dollars.</p>
<p>The money is available to help low-income residents from becoming homeless and homeless residents to find housing.</p>
<p>Thousands of people lined up Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some people in line falsely believed they were registering for $3,000 stimulus checks from the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>City officials told Local 4 that Detroit was granted $15 million to help residents pay bills and their rent or find temporary housing for the homeless.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The applications deadline is Oct. 7.</p>

		<p>As I watched this story on the news I wondered how many of the black Detroiters who came away empty-handed realize that their Democratic Party is allowing hordes of unskilled Muslims and Mexicans to pour into southeast Michigan.  Do the people of Detroit really prefer diversity over dollars?  </p>

		<p>Is ACORN distributing the checks? How much of the taxpayer provided cash will be used to pay drug peddlers?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The money is available to help low-income residents from becoming homeless and homeless residents to find housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homeless to homes, courtesy of US Government theft.  </p>
<p>The money is not &#8220;available&#8221;, it was stolen from the tax payers.  No one &#8220;becomes&#8221; homeless, you choose to be homeless by making the wrong choices.  You do not &#8220;find&#8221; housing, you earn money to buy housing.</p>
<p>What a mockery America has made of itself.  Is this the change America voted for?</p>

		<p>This was hysterical. It&rsquo;s amazing how these people who are so &#8216;disenfranchised&rsquo; (I despise that word) that they can&rsquo;t make it to the voting polls without a massive, organized effort to transport them to and from, can manage to make their way in a nanosecond to a location that is supposedly going to hand them free money. Typically, they came close to rioting when they found out the gathering was only to register them for FEMA help and not money for nothing.</p>

		<p>  Look for Detroit to be the first city to be effectively taken over by the Federal government. The city is bankrupt and can&rsquo;t pay the bills. This will be another sign of our continuing decline. </p>

		<p>I can hear the nuts in Washington:  Detroit is too big to fail!  Give them 1 trillion dollars of the tax payers money!</p>
