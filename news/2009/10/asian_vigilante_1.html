<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An investigation for Today has found disturbing evidence that Asian youths in parts of Oldham are trying to create no go areas for white people.</p>
<p>Last year the police investigated record levels of racist attacks in Oldham.Of the 572 cases, 60% turned out to be white victims.</p>
<p>Pakistanis make up the majority on the Glodwick estate just west of the town centre. Some youths speak the language of racial hatred. It&rsquo;s not clear whether this is bravado but their message is blunt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. white people keep out.</p>
<p>Many openly admit to carrying out what they see as revenge attacks on white people as part of a tit-for-tat campaign.</p>
<p>One told us: &#8220;There are signs all around saying whites enter at your risk. It&rsquo;s a matter of revenge. It&rsquo;s about giving as good as you can take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another had a six-inch scar running across his head. He said he had been attacked by a white gang.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got slashed by some whites so that I&rsquo;m totally racist. I don&rsquo;t like whites. It&rsquo;s like this now, we go to a white area and we get done over. It&rsquo;s like them coming here they get done over .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s for your own good.&#8221;</p>
<p>This hardening in attitude is repeated across the town and has passed down to children as young as 10. Unlike their parents they will not tolerate being victims of racism.</p>
<p>Local white people are scared and many want to leave the estates but cannot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just walking with my dog around 10 at night and a group of Asian youths in their car, music blaring, threatening me like saying they&rsquo;d kick me head in calling me white bastard, white scum. You&rsquo;re frightened,&#8221; one person told me.</p>
<p>Many Asian youths say they take the law into their own hands because they have no confidence in the police.</p>
<p>The perception is that the police do not take racist attacks on Asian people as seriously as assualts on white residents.</p>
<p>Akbor Khan had his three front teeth smashed in a brutal attack by a white gang:</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to have a take away in Manchester. We used to get lots of people who used to order food but not pay for it. It used to take the police an hour to get there. We&rsquo;d ring the police and they&rsquo;d say we haven&rsquo;t got the manpower. But if it happened to white people they would be there in 10 minutes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many Asian community leaders say the trouble is caused by a minority stoking up problems for the majority, who are law abiding residents.</p>
<p>They say they would happily support greater police action to clamp down on the trouble makers.</p>
<p>Greater Manchester Police deny the accusations levelled at them.</p>
<p>A special multi-agency task force has been set up in Oldham to tackle the growing number of racist attacks<br>

		<p>Coming from the BBC, one must take this with a grain of salt - but they&rsquo;ve got &#8220;white gangs&#8221; now?  I&rsquo;m reminded of my youth in L.A., when many of my friends were South American.  They were just starting to form gangs to protect themselves from the blacks.  Now, no doubt, British whites are forming gangs to protect themselves from Asians.  Is this good news?  I&rsquo;m not sure but at least it&rsquo;s some sort of white solidarity in a region where whites are sorely oppressed.</p>

		<p>I live in Ireland and work in a multicultural corporation. <br>
There is an Asian Pakistani guy working with me. He has a Quran on his desk as well as a prayer timetable etc. He constantly speaks on the phone with his friends/family in his language and I feel very distracted by this kind of behaviour, as he is very loud.<br>
He is so unproductive that I personally cannot believe that the company hired him because of his competence, but rather because of his background. He is looking for an Irish girlfriend/wife, because he wants to have an Irish citizenship. He has 5 siblings and he wants to bring them all to Ireland.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that Ireland would be doing very well without those people. They are totally useless. But at the moment hippies are ruling the EU and they are trying to implement their ideas. Listen to &#8220;Imagine&#8221; of John Lennon and compare the lyrics with what is going on. </p>
<p>I am afraid they will win and the white race will become extinct.</p>

What this means is that &#8220;Asian&#8221; ( note not British ) people are aware that they are not in their own country. This is a dilemma, because of course all people want self-determination; they want to control their communities, their territory. This is so basic a human drive that it is not to be believed this type of situation can continue into the future. There simply must be a break-up of British land into &#8220;go and no-go areas.&#8221; The price for multicultural politics is national humiliation. National humiliation is the goal of all Marxists; in a humiliated state a revolutionary cadre ( or so it is believed) can come onto the stage, point the finger at the ruling class and then take over. This is so well known it is almost boring to write about it.</p>
<p>Many community leaders say the trouble is caused by a minority stoking up problems for the majority, who are law abiding residents.</p>
<p>What this means is the community has its shock troops organized. These are known as trouble-makers to the outside world, but secretly applauded for now. In the not so distant future as British territory is ceded to Asians, they will become the leaders with whom the cowering authorities make peace.<br>
And what of the revolutionaries? Well, nothing really. The time for revolution has come and gone. The flow of information today precludes ignorance about the true state of countries that accept the Marxist mantle.<br>
So why is there multiculturalism?<br>
I have no idea at all.</p>

		<p>This article speaks for itself.  Welcome to the Balkanized Kingdom of Once-Great Britain.</p>
<p>On another note, I&rsquo;ve always wondered why so many Oriental people (Chinese, Japanese &amp; Koreans) these days get offended by the word and prefer to be called &#8220;Asian&#8221; instead.  A quick examination of the etymology of the word shows there&rsquo;s nothing &#8220;racist&#8221; about it.  </p>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Oriental" rel="nofollow">https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Oriental</a></p>
<p>Do they really want to be lumped together with the likes of Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Indians?  Do they really expect the rest of us mere mortals to believe they DO lump themselves together with those peooples?  Any thoughts, John Liu?</p>

<p>Whenever I hear numbers like these, I have to wonder. If the numbers are accurate, then the minority are perpetrating these crimes way out of proportion. If the minority are 10% of the populace, then they should be commiting 10% of these crimes. But more than likely they are commiting far more than the reported 60% of hatecrimes. It is my experience that many whites do not report these crimes when attacked by minorities. And too, many of the &#8220;crimes&#8221; commited by whites against minorities are &#8220;he looked at me wrong&#8221;, &#8220;he called me a racist name&#8221;, etc. I&rsquo;d love to know the actual numbers and would be shocked if minorities werent commiting more than 95% of these hatecrimes.</p>

		<p>	Great Britain has awakened: <br>
	Britain&rsquo;s indigenous population is suffering under the strain of multiculturalism which seems to be reserved for the lower classes; poor whites are the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values while hiding in their gated communities. <br>
	<br>
        Poor whites that are forced to live amongst foreigners are being attacked assaulted robbed and raped in disproportionate numbers; whites are often singled out as easy targets by other races because they present less resistance, you can&rsquo;t fix the problem by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br>

		<p>Unless whites band together now and seek to reinstate formal white rule, then we will continue to hear of such incidents as these. We simply have to become more militant, pro-white, and just as hostile as many angry non-whites. War has been declared on the white race. Numerous groups are slowly but surely trying to exact revenge on whites for past oppression at the hands of westerners. This war hasn&rsquo;t taken the form or large military conflicts, but rather mass immigration, multiculturalism, and culture wars. Even self-righteous, self-aggrandizing and childish anti-racists such as Tim Wise cannot bring themselves to say that racial balkanization is positive and it&rsquo;s normal for those in the &#8220;dominant&#8221; group to give up power to other groups. The likes of him argue that we misunderstand their intentions and that all they want is for us to &#8220;deconstruct white privilege&#8221; and redress past wrongs so we can all have &#8220;equality.&#8221; I hate to burst the anti-racist&rsquo;s bubble, but equality is a myth. As long as you have numerous competing groups and limited resources, there will never be true harmony or equality. Though we are taught by society what the different groups are (here is where I slightly part with Jared Taylor&rsquo;s views), we do have an us versus them mentality. This favoritism that people display towards their own group has been with us since humankind. </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #4. I have never liked the term &#8220;Asian&#8221;. It is too vague and ambiguous. No one single racial group inhabits the continent of Asia, which is the biggest in the world. What does a Japanese have in common with a Turk? Or a Chinese with an Arab? Or a Korean with a Pakistani? Isn&rsquo;t a White Russian born east of the Urals technically an &#8220;Asian&#8221; since that territory is a part of Asia? The term &#8220;Oriental&#8221; is not a slur. It should never have fallen into disrepute.</p>

<p>lol - in America it&rsquo;s pretty hard for a &#8216;minority&rsquo; to be accused of a racist attack no matter what happens, so I&rsquo;m not sure I buy it when the British authorities say 60% of these cases of &#8216;racial attacks&rsquo; have a white victim. Are they saying political correctness is not a hobby in the UK?</p>

<p>Another theory is that Marx/Leninism, and the obsession with destroying those who believe in religion, and the official promise put into writing to conquer the world with the red army, and of course communism&rsquo;s &#8216;failure&rsquo; itself, was simply a vast PR campaign designed to discredit communism. Of course that still doesn&rsquo;t answer the question of why nearly every university professor today, and virtually everyone really, is a communist. </p>

		<p>Anonymous White Person - &#8216;..all they want is for us to &ldquo;deconstruct white privilege&rdquo; and redress past wrongs so we can all have &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>To analyse this loony statement: &#8216;Asian&rsquo; immigrants to Britain - a white country created and built by white people over many centuries - expect indigenous Brits to give up any thought of ownership of their own country because it offends Asians who left their societies because they were (and are) bastions of inequality, corruption and poverty. </p>
<p>I suspect the real issue is that &#8216;Asians&rsquo; (and Africans) know they do not belong in Britain and will never be accepted as truly British, just as the British born in India would never be accepted as Indian. But of course, they would not regard themselves as Indian, or expect Indians to accept them as Indian.. </p>
<p>If you emigrate to a completely alien culture, it is not the fault of that culture if you never feel that you belong there. Your ancestors did not create that culture, or fight for it, or speak the same language. Simple really, but chip-on-the-shoulder resentment and jealousy gets in the way of admitting the plain truth.</p>

		<p>The white Britons had better do precisely as the Asian invaders are doing : mark their territory and defend it.</p>
<p>One of the ways human beings identify their territory is to name it.  I suggest the white Britons call their territory : &#8220;Britain&#8221;, and fight like mad dogs for it.   </p>
<p><br>
 ( That pretty much sums it up, but for those who enjoy the rants of the like-minded as much as I do, here follows the &#8220;second wind&#8221; -  a little longer commentary ) </p>
<p>Territoriality is part of natural law.  It is in the nature of birds, bears, and dogs as well as human beings.  This is because it confers an advantage in survival.  Without a habitat of sufficient territory, a species will go extinct.  This is common knowledge.  We go to great lengths to preserve the habitat of various creatures we find we have pushed to the brink of extinction - usually without ever having had any <br>
intention of doing so.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it involves putting up with some inconvenience or adjustment, such as changing the way or the places we build our homes &amp; buildings.   Sometimes it is a matter of education, such as the case with wolves, where we found we are actually better off having them around.   </p>
<p>It is a grave mistake, however,  to presume that territorial encroachment by other groups of human beings is tolerable through minor adjustment (or ought to be tolerated, even were it possible), or that education is all that is needed to show us that we are actually better off with large numbers of non-whites in places like Britain.  </p>
<p>It is natural for the Asians to attempt to expand their territory, and it is natural for Britons to resist their own conquest, so I think that the concept of criminality in all of this is misplaced.</p>
<p>The only crime in this story is the abdication of the British government in it&rsquo;s most fundamental duty to protect the nation and her people.   </p>

		<p>It was January 11, 2007, when Henry, then 15 and a ginger-haired star rugby player, popular with his class mates and with no history of being disciplined for poor behaviour, arrived at the tennis court at The Ridgeway School in Swindon to settle, &#8220;one on one&#8221;, an argument with a fellow pupil. Only it was a baying mob and not a single opponent waiting for him. What happened next, witnessed by more than 100 pupils – and even filmed by one on a mobile phone – was an ambush so vicious that, at the subsequent court case, the judge described it as a &#8221;savage and sustained attack&#8221;. It was, said Judge Carol Hagen when she passed sentence on 13 boys and young men who set upon Henry, a &#8221;miracle&#8221; that Henry had survived. Though the 13 Asian teenagers and young men who attacked Henry – all members of a gang who called themselves the &#8221;Asian Invaders&#8221; – were given sentences of between eight months and eight years for grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to commit GBH, no independent inquiry into how Henry was brutally assaulted, while at school, in an attack that was described in court as &#8221;something out of a Quentin Tarantino film&#8221;. During the trial, Judge Hagen was highly critical of the school, asking why there were no staff present in the tennis courts at the end of the school day, since it was known there had been trouble earlier in the day. For the past 14 months Henry&rsquo;s mother has battled for a full inquiry and, after gaining support from the Government, has now won the right to a Serious Case Review on the attack. The inquiry, which does not seek to apportion blame but to investigate what happened and evaluate what lessons can be learned, is expected to last four months and will, for the first time, lift the lid on alleged racial tensions within a school. &#8221;I&rsquo;ve fought hard to find out all the facts,&#8221; said Mrs Webster, who is also suing The Ridgeway School for neglect. &#8221;And it&rsquo;s been an excruciating wait. &#8220;The school might say otherwise but the fact is that the attack on my son was a racial one. The school knew there were tensions – there have been numerous similar attacks before but nothing was ever done. &#8220;Everything was swept under the carpet. Neither Henry or I am racist. But I feel my son was badly failed by a school that believes racism is only ever something that is carried out by white pupils.&#8221; It took a sustained campaign before the review was instigated by Mr Balls, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. After a meeting with Mrs Webster he wrote to her saying that it was &#8221;unacceptable that there has not been any full investigation of such a serious incident which left your son with permanent injuries&#8221;. Henry was repeatedly kicked, punched and battered before being beaten on the head with a claw hammer, fracturing his skull in three places and leaving him with permanent brain damage. The Swindon local authority referred the case to their Local Safeguarding of Children Board, which has now sanctioned the review. The headteacher of The Ridgeway School, Mr Steven Colledge, has said that he welcomes the investigation. The case has highlighted the extent of racist incidents in our schools and, in particular, the reluctance on the part of some to treat attacks as racist when they are carried out by minority cultures. Mrs Webster was not aware that, when those who carried out the crime came to court, it was up to the prosecution to cite the attack as racist. Had that been proved, the sentences meted out – especially to Wasif Khan, 19, described in court as &#8221;the hammer man&#8221; and who was jailed for eight years for wielding the weapon that fractured Henry&rsquo;s skull – may well have been much stiffer. What is particularly worrying, however, for parents in Swindon, is the light the case has shed on the number of racists attacks in the city&rsquo;s schools and how such incidents escalate. Between November 2006 and November 2008 police dealt with 337 crimes – 137 of them violent incidents – at Swindon schools. The highest number of those attacks, some 58, occurred at Churchfields school while 52 were recorded at Ridgeway school. In the past 12 months, admittedly, perimeter fences and bans on mobile phones has helped the school reduce its number of violent crimes. Henry, bleeding heavily from his head, was taken to hospital and, within 35 minutes, police had rounded up several of the gang members. It was Joe, Henry&rsquo;s younger brother, who telephoned his mother. He had been standing at a bus stop when a passing pupil told him Henry had been beaten up. &#8221;You can&rsquo;t imagine how it feels to see your son soaked in blood,&#8221; Mrs Webster said, tears threatening. &#8221;I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that no one from the school had called me to say there had been trouble earlier. All the pupils knew something was going on. &#8220;When I was with Henry at the local hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit one of Henry&rsquo;s friends telephoned me to say the same thing had happened to him some time before but he had managed to get away. &#8220;All the children knew that these &#8216;Asian invaders&rsquo; were terrorising white pupils.&#8221; For Mrs Webster the Serious Case Review will, she hopes, give some insight into how such a violent attack happened on the school premises. &#8221;As far as I can see there was no control and no discipline,&#8221; she says. &#8221;Bullying and violence were rife when Henry was attacked and I want the school to admit that.&#8221; Mr Colledge, the headteacher of The Ridgeway School, was unavailable for comment. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it should be any more of a slur than &#8216;occidental.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However since it has become, for reasons unknown to me, somewhat offensive, and it is widely known that it is somewhat offensive, then those using it, unless they are uninformed people over the age of 50, probably intend offense (in most, but not all cases).</p>
<p>But why it fell into disrepute in the first place, I don&rsquo;t really know - or perhaps it is because it does sort of conjure up stereotypical images of Chinese and Japanese - whereas &#8216;Asian&rsquo;, being more vague does not.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have never liked the term &ldquo;Asian&rdquo;. It is too vague and ambiguous. No one single racial group inhabits the continent of Asia, which is the biggest in the world. What does a Japanese have in common with a Turk?</p>
<p>The commonality factor wouldn&rsquo;t be crime, social problems or perpetual welfare dependency, now would it?</p>
<p>I agree, I AM painting with too broad a brush. The Japanese are infinitely more preferable than Pakis, Hindoos, Turks, for example. But WHY NOT KEEP EUROPE WHITE? Which concept would make one hell of a lot more sense for real European people.</p>

		<p>The BBC are no doubt talking nonsense - they are trying to even up what is a campaign of violence from Muslims against white British people spanning all areas of the UK where they live in any concentration, and make out it is as a result of &#8216;white racism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>One of the few options available to us is polygamy.  Our not too distant ancestors lived this way.  It was and is congruent with the natural order.  The church put an end to it, along with incest, in order to break up its competitors with large fortunes.</p>
<p>The Moslems do it and everyone here is afraid they will take over the world as a result.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened next, WITNESSED BY MORE THAN 100 PUPILS – and even filmed by one on a mobile phone – was an ambush so vicious.. &#8220;</p>
<p>Right in the highlighted part of that sentence is the source of the impending doom of the white race. A white boy is being viciously attacked by a group of Asians in the land of his ancestors. More than 100 pupils who no doubt are mostly white all stand by and WATCH like docile cows even filming the attack. Are they so neutered that they cannot even defend one of their own? Can they not see that it could be them next? <br>
What is wrong with white people?. Can anyone imagine a group of white boys beating up a Pakistani boy in Pakistan? They would be beaten to death for sure. They can&rsquo;t even try it. Then why should a group of Pakistani boys be able to try it in Britain? </p>

		<p>From the sound of Yorkshireman&rsquo;s post, I think we might be assured that the coming generation in GB will NOT be PC Liberals.  They will hopefully be deadly serious about taking back their country.  We may be witnessing the beginning of the turn around - at least in Europe.</p>

		<p>I and others have pointed out that the British call Pakistanis, Indians, Sri-Lankans and Bangles &#8220;Asian&#8221; and they are NOT!! especially the Pakis, are a bunch of surly, rude, arrogant, pushy, nasty, troublesome muslims with an entitlement attitude. I suspect most, if not all, of the trouble in fact is caused only by the Pakis, I have worked with them all and know the Pakistanis well.</p>

<p>It is part of the general PC movement to abolish all concepts of race, or even nationhood. Even the words.  These things are not supposed to exist any longer. It&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t even say you&rsquo;re &#8220;English&#8221; in England.  So people are designated by vague descriptions of continents, as if everyone in them is the same (which is the whole Marxist idea, at least in the West). </p>

<p>Docile cows is exactly the case. If you look at those nature films that show a pride of lions attacking, killing and eating a Cape Buffalo, you will see hundreds or thousands of other buffalo in the background milling around and just watching. If those buffalo acted in a concerted manner, they could kill each and everyone of those lions with EASE and save their fellow herd member!! BUT NO! NO &#8220;comradeship&#8221;, no thoughts or instinctive response to defend another member of the herd!  Whites also HAVE BECOME the prey animal for the predator [persons of color]!</p>

		<p>The problem is that the British gov&rsquo;t and E.U. keep letting foreigners like this in the country to begin with. When will people learn that multi-culturalism never works. Name me one multi-cutural civilization that has? Multi-culuralism leads to forced tolerance which further leads to cultural guilt on behalf of the host nation. This leads to the foreigners acting as a parasite on the host nation inevitably causing more problems on a sociological, economical, and political scale. Look at most multi-cultural centers in the world. They are decaying and suffer from high levels of internal conflict as each ethnic and/or cultural group tries to subjugate, dominate, or eradicate the other.</p>
