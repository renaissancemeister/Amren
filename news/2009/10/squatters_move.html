			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duncan Gardham, London Telegraph, September 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The squatters say they gained access to the three-storey Georgian house on Chester Square, Belgravia in Central London legally by opening an unlocked window with a broken payne in it.</p>
<p>There are now seven occupants, in the newly decorated house which has four bedrooms and two bathrooms. They come from countries including Nepal, Romania and the US.</p>
<p>One of them, Jake Tag, 29, is a former Green Jacket from Durban, South Africa, who now works as a building labourer. He served in the Army for six and a half years and did tours of Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving the forces three years ago.</p>
<p>Since then he has been journeying around the country working as a labourer and steel erector on building sites and often living in squats.</p>
<p>Mr Tag, who now has an en-suite bathroom and says he plans to borrow some furniture from friends, said he had walked down the street to Lady Thatcher&rsquo;s home, which is patrolled by armed police officers, to deliver a note inviting her around for tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t have much to say to her, it just seemed like the right thing to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We knew it was really close to Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s house. It&rsquo;s hard to believe we&rsquo;ve ended up living so near someone like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the richest place to live in London. Living here is a dream come true. We&rsquo;re going to keep the place clean and tidy and we won&rsquo;t do any damage. It&rsquo;s all perfectly legal and we just want to set up a nice home in an abandoned house.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be allowed to use these houses. Lots of them are empty and often the owners live abroad. I would love to have a decent pay-off from the army and my own house but that&rsquo;s not the way it works.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squatters say the property is owned by the Duke of Westminster&rsquo;s Grosvenor Estate. A notice on the door now reads: &#8220;We live in this property. It is our home and we intend to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chester Square has been home to celebrities such as Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, and houses there sell for up to £20m.</p>
<p>Steven, 54, who declined to give his last name, has been squatting or sleeping rough for eight years.</p>
<p>As he lay on a sleeping bag on the floor of his room, listening to the Prime Minister&rsquo;s speech at the Labour Party Conference on the radio, he said: &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got a lot of people on the streets, its coming up to winter and some of them will die. A good building like this should be available to put them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A team of scouts has been patrolling areas of central London to identify empty houses and then keeping an eye on them for three months before moving in.</p>
<p>They say they have a number in reserve and moved into the Chester Square residence after diplomatic protection officers persuaded them to move out of an 58-room property owned by the Sudanese government in Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>Next they plan to target the Government-run Crown estate where they say 13 per cent of the £43bn property empire is empty.</p>
<p>Mark Guard, 44, who has been producing a documentary about the squatters, said: &#8220;Margaret Thatcher has a 24-hour diplomatic security detail and nobody has noticed these squatters moving in so close to her house.</p>
<p>&#8220;These squatters come from all over the world and are here because they can&rsquo;t afford rent. They target homes in Belgravia, Kensington and Chelsea because rich people own them and just sit on a beach in another country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure residents including Margaret Thatcher won&rsquo;t be entirely happy with their new neighbours but these people are not going to do any damage, will keep the place tidy and are there entirely legally.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they get evicted from this house by the owners, they have other addresses in mind. There are lots of empty properties in this area.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;often living abroad&#8221; I told my spouse there would come a day to choose between the house in town and her  weekend ranch as you will not be able to own more than you can occupy. Sounds like the beginnings here. I also have a long time vacant building, which was finally vandalized after 7 years. So I`ve been reading up on the rules. 1.) Visit the site once a week at a minumum. Make  random visits both day and night 2.)Keep the grass mowed and the building in good repair. 3.) Remove all &#8220;flammables&#8221; from inside the structure and from 25ft around the outside. I was surprised and shocked to read that arson was the most common type of damage as well as the most severe. Hope this helps anyone in the same position. P.S. The article also said that this type of thing was going to SKYROCKET in the very near future&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Part of me thinks that the squatters should be run out by force, but part of me feels that if these rich people have so many homes that they sit empty for months at a time, maybe they should consider selling or renting them out. I mean, how many houses does a person need?</p>

		<p>Sorry I&rsquo;ve got to make this short. You see, there&rsquo;s this mansion across town that&rsquo;s been vacant now for over three months and we&rsquo;ve decided to move into it. My son is making the &#8220;we intend to stay&#8221; sign for the front door at this very moment. We&rsquo;re all SO happy!!!! </p>

		<p>Complete disdain for property rights and self righteous envy.  Welcome to de-evolution.  Blacks should feel right at home.  Maybe the richer Brits can hire muslims to fend off squatters by dismembering them.</p>

		<p>Sadly, squatting is pefectly legal if the property is empty. Evicting squatters is also a long and tiresome process. Under UK law, if a squatter occupies a property for 18 years continously, then he/she is granted full ownership of the property. There was one case a few years back where a tramp who had been living rough in a London park for over 20 years was granted ownership of the part of the park he lived in. He became a millionaire. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the law says about immigrant squatters though. </p>
<p>To be honest, a South African veteran and immigrants from the US doesn&rsquo;t sound bad at all. As long as there aren&rsquo;t African families with 10 children each moving in to these places, whilst there are people who work and pay astronomical rents to live in even the most grimy parts of London. </p>

		<p>If it were Texas, the owners could legally shoot all the squatters inside. It would be impossible to believe that the squatters will keep the place neat and tidy. They have no right to be there. They need to get out. How long will it be before squatters move in 5 minutes after you leave for work. It must be nice to come home after a hard day of work to find that foriegn vagrants have posted an eviction notice for you and your family. </p>

		<p>SOOOOOO if I read and interpret this correctly, in England, if you leave your home for a month, it is ok for the local homeless to move in and take it? I work overseas and am gone from my home for many months at a time..I DARE them to move into my property&hellip;</p>

		<p>These all sound like very up-scale type homes to me and I would like to know why they don&rsquo;t have a security system. </p>
<p>They should activate the security system when they are not living there and when the alarm goes off the police should investigate the matter. </p>
<p>On the other hand I have no love for the rich because they cause most of the problems to start with, wanting their lawns tended for very little money. The rich are the one&rsquo;s wanting the cheap labor that immigrants provide so I guess they should pay the price. There is no reason that the government should subsidize them by providing homes for their cheap labor. </p>

		<p>Laurence&rsquo;s post is correct: &ldquo;Squatting is pefectly legal if the property is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squatting rights are in fact protected under British law. The squatting movement in Britain goes back at least to the immediate post-WWII period, when returning soldiers moved into empty buildings because they couldn&rsquo;t find anywhere else to live. The movement gained new impetus during the late 60s and early 70s when a serious housing shortage in London coincided with the rise of political activism. But not all squatters were hippie types. Unless they qualified for public housing, lot of working people found it extremely hard to find any kind of rental accommodation, like a bed-sit (rooming house).</p>
<p>Usually the squats are run-down publicly-owned houses that municipal authorities have left empty, but the homes of the rich and famous are not immune.</p>
<p>There is a racial angle to Britain&rsquo;s housing problems, however. There are lots of stories of recent immigrants being given priority for subsidized public housing. The BNP has taken up this issue.<br>

		<p>Since the british have enacted draconian &#8220;gun control&#8221; laws, the victim of a home invasion is likely to get MORE prison time than the &#8220;poor misguided criminal&#8221; if he attempts to defend his LIFE.  There are already many cases of this in the UK.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying what the squatters are doing is right or even fair. As a matter of fact, if I were on the receiving end of this deal I would be enraged. Its just hard to convince the public, especially in the middle of an economic downturn, that you need 5 houses, 4 of which sit empty for most of the year. </p>

		<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but did the TV series &#8220;Upstairs, Downstairs&#8221; take place in Belgravia? That was the upper class area of London 100 years ago and still is? </p>
<p>&#8220;this type of thing was going to SKYROCKET in the very near future&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, this exists in a different form in the U.S. The colonias along the border with Mex. Actually properties abutting the Rio Grande. Property sold to Mexican illegals for the most part, turned into living residences, squalid hovels for the most part, and not ZONED for private residence. Have become villages without any utilities other than electricity illegally hooked up and stolen. Villages with residence where none is permitted, but has become so. Just TRY to move those folks out of there in the future and see what happens.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with squatting. The article stated that some of the squatters are from the US. That surprised me.  These American squatters couldn&rsquo;t do that here in the USA as you cannot legally enter or stay on a property that is not yours unless you have the consent of the owner and I agree. Just because a property is unoccupied  does not give you the right to stay there at all, only if you bought said property or have owner consent.</p>

		<p>Actually there are laws in many states known as squatters rights.  If the squatter occupies a piece of property for a certain length of time (the length of time will vary from state to state) without the owner removing them, the squatter can petition the court for legal right of ownership.</p>
<p>A very good reason to keep your property inspected, particularly if you have a large parcel of land with illegals squatting on it.</p>

<p>This is just wrong. If someone owns something, nobody has the right to come in and live there and then own it because they have been there for a period of time. If it&rsquo;s not yours, it&rsquo;s not yours.</p>
