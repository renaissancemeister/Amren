			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Schools are being ordered to close on Muslim, Hindu and Sikh holy days despite objections from teachers.</p>
<p>The directive by two London councils means the schools must shut for the annual celebrations of Eid-Ul-Fitr, Diwali and Guru Nanak&rsquo;s birthday in addition to the traditional Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>The policy even affects schools with only a small number of Muslim, Hindu or Sikh pupils.</p>
<p>Headteachers have complained about the enforced holidays, arguing they should decide if the religious dates are marked with days off.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounds Waltham Forest and Newham councils, which have publicised their school calendars for Autumn 2009-2010.</p>
<p>They both told schools to take off September 21 for Eid-Ul-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.</p>
<p>Diwali, which is celebrated by Hindus, was also included in the calendar as a holiday, but this year it fell on Saturday October 17.</p>
<p>Guru Nanak&rsquo;s birthday is scheduled for a holiday on November 2. It is celebrated by Sikhs and Nanak&rsquo;s teachings form a central part of their scripture.</p>
<p>The policy in Waltham Forest affects all community primary and secondary schools in the borough, but not Church of England or Catholic schools.</p>
<p>A review of the policy has begun after complaints from schools. Rachel MacFarlane, head of Walthamstow School for Girls, said the school is &#8216;frustrated&rsquo; by the holiday requirements.</p>
<p>Councillor Liaquat Ali, Cabinet member for children and young people in Waltham Forest, said it was important to teach children about different cultures and backgrounds &#8216;as much as possible&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Nobody was available to comment from Newham Council yesterday.<br/>

		<p>So what the point in even trying anymore? When we look at England, we see our future. The only question remaining is; come the mid-century who will control America? Will it be the Hispanics or the Muslim or the Communists?</p>

		<p>Cancel them all and only have soltice and equinox days off, making four in total for the entire year.  Cancel MLK day and keep Vets and Memorial Days.  No more Fourth of July, it has become a joke and nothing more than an excuse to put a lot of sulfur in the air.  This will allow enough of a holiday spread for all the particular groups, since they all are based on the original observances of celestrial movements.</p>

I feel it will be the Hispanics ruling America.  They&rsquo;re pretty good at siezing power when people least expect it.  The Muslims don&rsquo;t care and the communists don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>

		<p>I say dump any and all holidays. As Christians, we do not keep Christmas (we are not JWs) and don&rsquo;t want our son to participate in such holidays.  I&rsquo;d homeschool if I could, but can&rsquo;t due to circumstances.</p>
<p>Just have the patriotic holidays such as Memorial Day, etc.</p>
