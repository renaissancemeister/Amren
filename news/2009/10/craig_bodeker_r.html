<h1>Craig Bodeker Refutes the SPLC</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Bodeker, Press Release, October 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>[Craig Bodeker is a filmmaker who produced</i> A Conversation About Race,<i> which we have reviewed <a href="/ar/2009/02/index.html#article2" target="review" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 8th, and again on October 9th, Sonia Scherr, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, published two separate and scathing attacks on me and my documentary film, A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE, on their HATEWATCH website.</p>
<p>Ms. Scherr made eight specific points regarding the film&rsquo;s &#8220;errors,&#8221; before concluding that I am, in fact, a &#8220;racist.&#8221; Most critics agree the film does an excellent job pointing out the vagueness of that term, and that how it has recently morphed into the intellectual equilivent of calling me a &#8220;poopyhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will still address Ms. Scherr&rsquo;s eight points here.</p>
<p>Point 1</p>
<p>&#8220;Bodeker never says whether he believes that discrimination found by courts and government commissions also doesn&rsquo;t &#8216;really amount to anything.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s more real to you? Spontaneous answers from real people, or proclamations issued by courts and government commissions?</p>
<p>Point 2</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes no effort to examine the scientific findings on intelligence and race, which have yet to produce convincing evidence that IQ differences are caused by genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because neither I nor any of the subjects said anything about causality. Nearly every interview-subject stated clearly that they believe blacks outscore whites in basketball, but that whites outscore blacks on standardized tests, and that Asians outscore whites on those same tests. Are these &#8220;beliefs&#8221; really radical and bigoted? Or are they mainstream?</p>
<p>Point 3</p>
<p>&#8220;After trying to get interviewees to admit that blacks are more criminal than whites.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; See the film. I don&rsquo;t &#8220;try&#8221; to get anyone to admit anything. Each subject was chosen for their candor.</p>
<p>Point 4</p>
<p>&#8220;What he neglects to mention is that it&rsquo;s unclear how many, if any, of the black-on-white rapes were hate crimes  &mdash;  that is, motivated at least in part by racial bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department report cited in the film, blacks sexually assaulted white women over 37,000 times in 2005. Whites sexually assaulted black women less than ten times. 37,000 to 10. How &#8220;random&#8221; does that sound to you?</p>
<p>Point 5</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, Bodeker asserts that Latinos are deliberately taking away whites&rsquo; majority status. &#8216;If we object to the stated agenda of replacing whites as the racial majority in America with Hispanics, it&rsquo;s us who get called the racists,&rsquo; he says, &#8216;not the people who are openly and actively working to change the racial makeup of our country.&rsquo;&#8221; I don&rsquo;t really see the criticism here. Have they heard of La Raza?</p>
<p>Point 6</p>
<p>&#8220;The South Carolina Council of Conservative Citizens  &mdash;  a white supremacist group whose national conference Bodeker attended in June in Mississippi  &mdash;  recently hosted a big-screen showing of the movie in three locations.&#8221; And they told me they were Conservative Citizens.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.! (I did actually ask the organizer if the CofCC was a &#8220;white Supremacist&#8221; group. He said absolutely not.) According to the SPLC, white organizations cannot be trusted to accurately stereotype themselves.</p>
<p>Point 7</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the documentary&rsquo;s release last year, Bodeker has given interviews to the Romanian National Vanguard News Agency (motto: &#8216;International News for People of European Descent&rsquo;), Mark Dankof (a radio broadcaster who also contributes to the anti-Semitic American Free Press), and The Political Cespool, an overtly anti-Semitic, racist show whose guests have included former Klan boss David Duke, neo-Nazi April Gaede and Holocaust denier Mark Weber&#8221;</p>
<p>How dare I seek publicity for my documentary! Why don&rsquo;t I just calmly wait &#8216;til CNN or PBS calls me to air it? Seriously, though, am I now to be held personally responsible for every word ever uttered by the staff, or even by the guests, of any radio show that I&rsquo;ve appeared on? I accepted the generosity of those few in today&rsquo;s media that actually understand the concept of free speech, warts and all!</p>
<p>Point 8</p>
<p>&#8220;On The Political Cesspool&rsquo;s Jan. 31 show, for instance, one of the hosts asserts that &#8216;everything that is good about civilization  &mdash;  just about everything that is good, from literature to works of art to law is something that came from our [white people&rsquo;s] minds.&rsquo; Bodeker&rsquo;s response? &#8216;I have to agree.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What part of &#8220;just about&#8221; don&rsquo;t you understand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?</p>
<p>On the next day, October 9th, Ms. Scherr released her follow-up attack. But rather than offer any stronger, or legitimate criticisms of, A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE, she chose a different tactic. She relied upon an anonymous cyber-stalker to gather &#8220;quotes&#8221; attributed to me from the comments section of unrelated political videos from Youtube. She called this piece of journalism &#8220;A Peek Behind the Curtain: Views of a Racist Filmmaker .&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#8221;</p>
<p>Some pretty strong statements were quoted  &mdash;  as well as MIS-quoted, surgically and deceptively edited,, taken out of context, and even made up! And once again, these &#8220;quotes&#8221; that represent proof of my &#8220;racism,&#8221; were found on the comments section of Youtube.</p>
<p>Have any readers ever been to the comments section on Youtube? Does anyone NOT KNOW what a mosh-pitt of &#8220;free expression&#8221; it is? There are, sometimes, actual screaming matches, even though they&rsquo;re conducted in written form. Sometimes people say harsh, mean things there, in that last remaining refuge of Free Speech. Am I to assume that the SPLS&rsquo;s Sonia Scherr has never made a sarcastic comment? Or even a distasteful one? Or that anyone who EVER has should be stereotyped, marginalized and disenfranchised? This seems to be what the SPLC suggests.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Most who have viewed <cite>A Conversation About Race,</cite> say it succeeds because of its fairness and clarity. American Thinker&rsquo;s Larry Miller said, in his positive review of the film, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. People in America have no idea how to define &#8216;racism.&rsquo; The word flits about like an evil spirit in our national vocabulary  &mdash;  but none of us knows exactly what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I will take it as a compliment, that the Southern Poverty Law Center, after viewing <cite>A Conversation About Race,</cite> (no doubt through a legal microscope) cannot find any genuine aspects of it to criticize, and end up instead having to resort to that same, tired conclusion, &#8220;Craig Bodeker is a Racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call me optimistic, but I see that as progress. They cannot refute the film&rsquo;s basic premise, even though it contradicts the very essence their stated mission!</p>
<p>So instead they call me a poopyhead.<br>

		<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; has, indeed, lost its power to sting and the reason is that money-making non-profits like SPLC (pronounced spee-lack) have so manipulated its meaning that it has no meaning, except nowadays it just means &#8220;shut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, supremacy is still alive and well, and we&rsquo;ve been getting a big dose from President Obama.  </p>
<p>2004   &mdash;   &#8220;Acting white&#8221; which operates to smother the richly-textured &amp; vibrant diversity among the diverse white American peoples.  We all act the same.</p>
<p>2008   &mdash;   &#8220;Typical white person&#8221; which operates to push all of us into one clone-like clump of uniform people.</p>
<p>2009   &mdash;    Comments about the Cambridge scandal when Obama opened his mouth in the absence of facts, and made official pronouncements.</p>
<p>Each of these three events expose the heart and mind of Obama to us and reveal a hard core supremacist who claims the right to name, label, describe, and define what is to him, the Other, by his choice.  We don&rsquo;t need to call him a racist, he has proven he is a supremacist in a racially-charged way.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve think we&rsquo;ve come to the point where the proper response to being accused of being a &#8220;racist&#8221; is to say, &#8220;So what?&#8221;.  After all, a racist today is simply any white person who cares for the interests and even the survival of his own race, who is against government, university, and corporate programs of racial discrimination, and who is opposed to illegal immigration and mass immigration.  None of those positions require any apology.</p>

		<p>I saw parts of Craig Bodeker&rsquo;s film and think it&rsquo;s terrific; I plan to buy it.  It&rsquo;s fair, resonably argued, and generally well done.  It&rsquo;s about as timely a film as one can imagine, considering what I see as a slow awakening of White racial consciousness in America amid the onslaught of ethnic particularism demonstrated by so many minority, non White groups.</p>
<p>On a personal level, though, I was a little dismayed at his lumping Jewish interest groups with the aforementioned briefly in the film.  I have always thought of myself as White and want Whiteness and White people to flourish.</p>

		<p>Well, I did my part. I emailed the University of Iowa, to try to get their theatre to air the movie. I&rsquo;d like to see it. Every little bit helps. although this &#8216;university&rsquo; is so left wing liberal, it&rsquo;s insane. I would love to see Jared come down and give a lecture. The feminazi lesbos would line up for miles to whine and moan. No blacks in hte city, they can&rsquo;t afford it, the &#8216;hood is miles away, so no worries there! :) <br>
My girlfriend and I always joke with the hilarious phrase &#8220;DAS RACIS&rsquo;!&#8221; It&rsquo;s so old and worn out, but still funny.<br>
It&rsquo;s like a whining child- eventually it&rsquo;s all white noise. HA - no pun intended.</p>

		<p>Craig Bodeker&rsquo;s film is a great piece of work and its logic is excellent.  It exposes the hypocrisy and the racial double standards that are applied to Whites - and only Whites.  It exposed the incredible conditioning job that has been perpetrated on Whites to view themselves with such incredibly low self-esteem.<br>
It also exposed the trifling experiences that many of the non-Whites in the documentary spoke about, experiences that would not be considered discrimination at any level by anybody.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter how logical or well-reasoned ones&rsquo; arguments are, they will still be attacked.  </p>

		<p>White, Jewish, and Proud,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, leftist attitudes are held by (if I understand correctly) about 75% of Jews in America.  (Also, I believe the same is true for about 95% of blacks).</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer necessary to strive for separation based on race.  Giving the leftists their own homeland would effectively rid us of the worst elements of society, and race need not even be mentioned.</p>
<p>That way, we get to keep Michael and Mark Levin and Alan Keyes, for example.</p>

		<p>People need to watch what they say on the Internet.  Ethically, I would argue that you shouldn&rsquo;t say anything that you aren&rsquo;t willing to stand behind were it to go public, although this rule does need modified a little given the current intolerance toward even the most reasonable, non-hateful pro-white discourse.  But seriously, in this case, Craig made stupid, hateful comments and he should own up to them.  You just can&rsquo;t use ad hominem or counterfactual insults like &#8220;fags&#8221; or &#8220;monkeys&#8221; or the talk about the possible need to lynch people like Van Jones without expecting to get called on it.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made stupid comments myself along these lines on YouTube. But I&rsquo;m not proud of them. I&rsquo;ve done them under an assumed name, and I&rsquo;d be embarrassed if they came out and were revealed to be mine. If they did come out, I would apologize. I would admit I have my irrational, hateful, resentful moments, but that I am aware of them and try to hold them in check in my writing, thinking, and interactions with others. </p>
<p>Craig made a damn good film.  It is especially good in that   &mdash;   and this is similar to some of Jared&rsquo;s writing and talking   &mdash;   it has the power to speak to the unconverted, to speak to those who dismiss or know nothing about white advocacy or the ridiculousness of most liberal discourse on race, and get them to admit that pro-white or race realist ideas are reasonable, and are not NECESSARILY based on hate or ignorance. As someone who I would hope WANTS to speak to a broader audience, Craig should have known these comments would come back to haunt him.  He shouldn&rsquo;t have made them and if he had made them he should have tried to remove them earlier.  Unless he WANTS to stay marginalized and speak only to the already converted.  </p>
<p>As an effort in damage control, he should examine how Sharpton and Jackson and other blacks have smoothed things over about saying similar hateful and indefensible things in their careers.<br>
Perhaps Obama&rsquo;s defense of Rev. Wright last year, when he talked about how much racism he encountered growing up and so forth, and how that warped and embittered him, is a reasonable tack to take.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: some of us do say hateful things towards minorities in private or anonymously.  We should own up to it manfully.  We&rsquo;ve just had to put up with too much anti-white hatred and intolerance of heterodox views on racial matter over the years.  Occasionally it drives us nuts.  </p>

		<p>The SPLC and like minded dements are missing one philosophical point that glares at me.  It is the simple, but so-true metaphor of the hand that points a finger has four more pointing back at themselves.  An organization that thrives on the accusations of injustices due to racism must indulge in racism themselves in order to survive, so that is what they do.</p>
<p>My view is &#8220;so what?&#8221;  That is because it is a biological imperative for survival that differences are noticed and that it is natural for &#8220;birds of a feather to flock together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know where you got your figures.  </p>
<p>I hear the same thing all the time, ad nauseum. But I can tell you those Jews I talk to about politics (admittedly not many) have a distincly right turn in their thinking.  Liberals and Lefties just make the most noise.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a great movie. A movie is a big deal. Could he perhaps, have been paid to make these outrageous statements (assuming there&rsquo;s some truth to them, which ones did he make and which ones are &#8216;made up&rsquo;?), that is, paid to discredit himself. Money talks very loudly. Not as loud as ideology, at least for a liberal, but it talks pretty loud. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Monkeys&rsquo; Who uses that kind of language anytime?  At the same time, if Michael Moore or someone refers to George Bush as a &#8216;douche&rsquo; even in public in front of a viewing audience, the media have no problem with that, seeing it as &#8216;cute&rsquo;. Why don&rsquo;t they have a problem with Michael Moore&rsquo;s films? It shows how neutral and unbiased they really are. </p>

		<p>The SPLC has no ability to refute Craig on logical grounds so they choose to bash him for some of his comments on YouTube which have nothing to do with his video.  Of course the SPLC knows they can&rsquo;t refute Craig and as usual those are the tactics they are forced to apply in order to attempt to beat him in a debate.</p>
<p>Read this SPLC link:</p>
<p>https://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=721</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, white Americans have brutalized American Indians. Half a millennium later, the hate goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it appears the SPLC has no problem making general and racist remarks against white people and then they claim to be a hate watch site?  Please.  They are one of the most outwardly racist websites I have ever seen.  They employ every form of racism they claim to be against.  In reality, they show us that they think racism is alright, as long as it is not racism towards non-whites.</p>

		<p>Mr. Bodeker is a very brave man and his DVD is well worth the money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say though that the term racist is far more severe than a childish name.  For such names that children call each other are never as psychologically intense or as stigmatizing as what the Marxists employ.  A better comparison would be to heretic.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to just insult you, make you frown, they want to destroy your credibility and your life.  While they are not as homicidal as true communists, not yet, they still employ a soft totalitarianism through the media and litigation.</p>
<p>Look how easily they controlled Rush Limbaugh, who isn&rsquo;t even a threat to them.  They have the power to fire you or decide if you have the right to be a part of the mainstream.</p>
