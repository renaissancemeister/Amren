<h1>Immigrant &#8216;Uncles and Aunties&rsquo; Help Indian American Candidates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shira Toeplitz, CQ-Roll Call, October 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the last day of the third quarter, Democrat Manan Trivedi hosted a fundraiser for friends and family  &mdash;  his extended network of &#8220;Uncles and Aunties&#8221;  &mdash;  that raised $10,000 in two hours at the Lantern Lodge, an Indian-American-owned restaurant and hotel in southeastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As one of the higher-profile Indian-American candidates running for Congress next year, Trivedi estimates that 20 percent to 25 percent of the $127,500 he raised in the first three weeks of his campaign for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 6th District seat came from his connections to the Indian-American community. And he said he&rsquo;s only begun to tap into the affluent ethnic network, which has recently become fertile fundraising ground.</p>
<p>Fellow physician and Indian-American candidate Ami Bera raised more than $600,000 in five months for his campaign as a Democratic hopeful in California, while Kansas state Rep. Raj Goyle, also a Democrat, raised $403,000 in the past three months for his open-seat bid. According to Bhavna Pandit, a Democratic fundraiser who specializes in the Indian-American community, the influx of Indian-American candidates this cycle is unprecedented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bera, who is running in the primary for the opportunity to face Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., estimated that about 50 percent to 60 percent of his money came from Indian Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian-American community has responded overwhelmingly in a way that I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve responded previously,&#8221; Bera said. {snip}</p>
<p>The goal for politically active Indian-Americans has been to elect one of their own to Congress ever since now-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, left the House in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 10 years, Indian Americans have begun to become more politically engaged in the life of the nation now that they&rsquo;ve achieved a certain degree of economic success,&#8221; said Anil Mammen, a Democrat who runs a political consulting firm, the Mammen Group.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&rsquo;t have had political consultants in my parents&rsquo; generation,&#8221; said Mammen, a son of Indian immigrants. &#8220;They just didn&rsquo;t have that cultural connection with this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Indian-American community, you have to have another person ask on your behalf in order to be successful,&#8221; Barve said. &#8220;Because Indians don&rsquo;t want to give their money to anybody. We&rsquo;re cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indian-American candidates typically hit up their parents&rsquo; generation  &mdash;  otherwise known as the &#8220;Uncle and Auntie&#8221; generation of well-educated and affluent immigrants  &mdash;  when they are on the hunt for donors.</p>
<p>And while most politicians dial for dollars on the phone, Indian-American candidates sometimes make their appeals at the home of an Indian-American through an intermediary trusted in the community.</p>
<p>Devaguptapu, a first-generation Indian-American, said his community is especially powerful for candidates because it tends to be large but close-knit. Because India is such a big and diverse country, he said it&rsquo;s easier to have a larger community here in the states because immigrants tend to worry less about regionalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the benefit of the Indian-American community is you tend to have larger friends and family units,&#8221; Devaguptapu said. {snip}<br>

		<p>I am sure that most Indian-Americans are decent people.  I sometimes like going to Asian-Indian restaurants in my home town of Philadelphia.  I would much rather walk past a group of Sikhs, than a gang of blacks, at night.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that I have a love India&rsquo;s culture.  To everyone reading this post, did you see the movie &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire&#8221;?  When I saw this movie, what began to, and still does,  deeply disturb me about India&rsquo;s culture are these begging mafia gangs who amputate limbs, or render blind, the children they recruit, in order to make what they think will be better beggars.  Either these unfortunate children are recruited by these gangs, or often it is even the parents themselves who mutilate and maim their own children for the begging profession. </p>
<p>I hope that immigrants from India to the USA, do not bring this horrible practice to our country.  I do not know if it is acceptable in India&rsquo;s prisons, but I do know that if a criminal gang that maimed and mutilated the children it recruited was arrested, tried, convicted, and sent any prison in the USA, the other prison inmates would make sure such gang operators get the justice they deserve!</p>
<p>Another disturbing thing about India&rsquo;s culture, is that there is a temple in India where people worship live rats.  As a non-religious freethinker, I respect the right of every individual to freedom of religion and even freedom from religion, regardless of whether you are a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Buddhist, or even an atheist or an agnostic.  But just imagine the trouble it would cause in any American city, if a temple to worship live rats was built.  Urban areas in America already have serious problems with rats, without having a temple where live  rats permanently reside and are worshipped.  Please don&rsquo;t build such a temple in my Rittenhouse  Square section of Philly!</p>
<p>On a more positive note, as I said before, I am sure most Indian-Americans are decent people, who are  just as much against these horrible things that happen in India, as I am.  What I have said in this post does mean that I condemn all people of Asian-Indian heritage for the bad things about India&rsquo;s culture.  I am sure many  Asian-Indian immigrants come to this country to get away from these bad things that I mention.  In 2012, if he should make a Presidential bid, I will even give serious consideration to voting for Bobby Jindal, especially if he can present a better plan for getting our country out this recession, than President Obama!</p>

<p>Slithering into our country and moving yourself and your people up the ladder of power is not what I&rsquo;d call &#8220;decent&#8221; behavior.</p>
<p>BTW, Bobby Jindal is NOT a natural born U.S. citizen and is therefore ineligible to be President.  But what the heck; Barry Obama has changed that rule, hasn&rsquo;t he?<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that sub-continental Indians will be the next big immigration story in the USA.<br>
 - Just a word of warning,there&rsquo;s over a billion of them, they have a standard of living a fraction of a Mexican&rsquo;s and their all madly determined to enter your country.<br>
 Oh, and by the way, your political class wants them all in.</p>

		<p>No Hindu has any business being in this country, except on a diplomatic passport.  Their culture is not merely utterly alien, their caste system is absolutely antithetical to Western values.  Let them invade Africa instead, a place with a ready-made servile class.</p>

		<p>Does this money from their ancestors offset the millions of tax breaks and low interest loans given to them for purchasing American businesses? The same Indians who are given these advantages that Americans are not eligible for in acquiring a businesses employ their entire family in that business, and then when they are wealthy enough to sell it, bring other &#8220;Uncles and Aunties&#8221; over from India to sell that business to for $1. </p>
<p>Somehow I hardly think the $$ coming in equals the $$$ going out.</p>

<p>A vote for Bobby Jindal is a  vote for the race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population at the hands of post 1965 hindus in America. They are not nice people. They are the mortal enemy of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>Someone one has to stick up for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS at a time when they are under attack from hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.</p>

		<p>I agree with Jupiter.  Ross is getting a little too ahead of himself here.  My parents are pretty realistic when it comes to race issues, but I am surprised at how naive my mom was when she was cheering on Bobby Jindal several months ago, when he was the new Republican &#8220;answer&#8221; to Obama.</p>
<p>I told her how foolish she was.  Didn&rsquo;t she know what was going on?  Obama gets elected and then he immediately puts as many nonwhites into power as possible.  Then the Republican response is to put up Micheal Steele and Bobby Jindal.  </p>
<p>If any white person can&rsquo;t see what is going on with this, then they are flat out clueless (I will refrain from using a more unpolite word).  This is obviously NOT who is best for the Republican Party.  This is ALL ABOUT RACE and nothing else.  I am so sickened by how many white Republicans think Jindal is our new answer.  Talk about commiting suicide.</p>
<p>But all of this is beside the point.  Indians have no business ruling this country, Ross.  You know it and I know it.</p>

		<p>What I resent about immigrants from India is the way they will open or purchase a business, then proceed to terminate the employment of the Americans, often whites, and then hire only Indian immigrants. This may sound minor to you, but to some of us working in blue collar jobs it is important. Often, we must string together 2 or 3 or even more low paying jobs to have anything at all! So, that convenience store job really is important to us. </p>
<p>What further enrages me is that the Indian immirgrant will get tax breaks for having the business. I can&rsquo;t get that! My family can&rsquo;t get that! They will then sell the business to a relative from India, and they get tax breaks,and the cycle contiues! How unfair! I refuse to patronize any Indian owned business or gas stations in the area for this reason.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what in the world your point is.  I am saying that the Republicans have Jindal for the same reason the Dems put Obama front and center.  Our country decides its candidates with a &#8220;anyone but a white man mentality&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t understand the point you are trying to make as a rebuttal.<br>
