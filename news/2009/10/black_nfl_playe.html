			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ohm Youngmisuk, New York Daily News, October 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mathias Kiwanuka loves his former defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, but the Giants&rsquo; defensive end says he will never play for Spagnuolo&rsquo;s Rams if Rush Limbaugh purchases the team.</p>
<p>Kiwanuka and the Jets&rsquo; Bart Scott made it clear Thursday that they would never play for the Rams or any team owned by the controversial conservative radio host.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I know is from the last comment I heard, he said in (President) Obama&rsquo;s America, white kids are getting beat up on the bus while black kids are chanting &#8216;right on,&rsquo;&#8221; Kiwanuka told The Daily News. &#8220;I mean, I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with a team that he has any part of. He can do whatever he wants, it is a free country. But if it goes through, I can tell you where I am not going to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Limbaugh&rsquo;s controversial comments are well-known. He resigned from ESPN in 2003 after he said the media were &#8220;very desirous that a black quarterback do well&#8221; in reference to Philadelphia&rsquo;s Donovan McNabb being overrated. &#8220;If he&rsquo;s rewarded to buy them, congratulations to him,&#8221; McNabb said during his weekly press conference. &#8220;But I won&rsquo;t be in St. Louis anytime soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott says players remember what Limbaugh said, and adds that the NFL would be wise not to allow the nationally syndicated host into the league. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an oxymoron that he criticized Donovan McNabb,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;A lot of us took it as more of a racial-type thing. I can only imagine how his players would feel. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t want to play for him. He&rsquo;s a jerk. He&rsquo;s an  &mdash;  . What he said (about McNabb) was inappropriate and insensitive, totally off-base. He could offer me whatever he wanted, I wouldn&rsquo;t play for him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wouldn&rsquo;t play for Rush Limbaugh. My principles are greater and I can&rsquo;t be bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kiwanuka cringes at the idea of Limbaugh becoming an NFL owner. &#8220;They are flat-out racist,&#8221; Kiwanuka said of many of Limbaugh&rsquo;s statements. &#8220;He jumps on Obama and he jumps on other people for being racist. But a lot of the comments that he said, I feel like they have no place in journalism. It is just an opinion show that should be only be taken for shock value. I liken it to &#8216;South Park&rsquo; when I am listening to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Kiwanuka doesn&rsquo;t want to play for a team owned by a white man who tells the truth; the same white man who he admits to listening to? </p>
<p>Then he calls Rush a racist and fails to give examples. Did the reporter ask for specific examples of Rush&rsquo;s racism or if he could even define racism.</p>

		<p>It would be great if Rush Limbaugh would buy the Rams team and make it an all-white one. Go, FIGHTING WHITIES!  As it is now, white people pay outlandish ticket prices to support mostly black football &amp; basketball teams, who are nothing more than thugs &hellip;and I always wonder why they do it?

		<p>The lunacy never ends.  Many people saw that poor White kid recently get punched around by Blacks on that bus video.  We can&rsquo;t even point out the facts without being labeled racist, and if someone like Rush mentions it, then by God, he&rsquo;s a racist and he has a problem!  How sick is it going to get?  Let this SOB Kiwanuka go to another team if he doesn&rsquo;t like Rush owning it.  That&rsquo;s his tough luck.</p>

<p>Blacks never see the honesty in any spoken truth.  They defend the worst among themselves and wonder why so many of us whites still want nothing to do with them.  For many of us, respect still must be earned.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been following this contretemps for awhile, as I&rsquo;m both a regular Rush listener and a Rams fan (although one with paper bag firmly over head so far this season.)  That Rush was interested in the Rams has been rumored in St. Louis for most of the last year.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Kiwanuka, I have many thoughts about it:</p>
<p><a href="https://countenance.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/kiwanukas-club/" rel="nofollow">https://countenance.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/kiwanukas-club/</a></p>
<p>The latest news is that Al Sharpton, the (black) President of the players&rsquo; union, one D&rsquo;Maurice Smith, and a local St. Louis cracker jack box theology degree black preacher named B.T. Rice are all mouthing off against the deal.  </p>
<p>Sharpton:  Two words:  Tawana Brawley.  You&rsquo;ve no credibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, the Players&rsquo; Union President:  You mouth off about principles and right of players to speak their minds.  (Though this right does not seem to apply to Rush Limbaugh, in your mind.)  If it&rsquo;s really about principles, then have all the black players of the San Diego Chargers quit, because its owner is Alex Spanos, a Limbaughite in ideology and a friend thereto.  If, as you imply, Rush is a Nazi slaver, then Spanos is, too.</p>
<p>B.T. Rice:  I won&rsquo;t elaborate, it&rsquo;s mainly an STL thing, but he&rsquo;s got no credibility, either.</p>
<p>In reality, I can only wish the blacks were serious about boycotting.  That way, we might get thrown into the briar patch, have an all-white team, bring in Don Wassall as GM, and finally break the caste system.  </p>

		<p>With the St Louis Rams doing &#8220;so well&#8221; this football season Rush would be well off, if he bought the team, to see many &#8220;color aware&#8221; members to do an exodus from St Louis for a kinder, gentler city that appreciates their alleged racial concerns.  When your at the bottom of your division it usually indicates a deep seated problem.  Bye, bye crybabies, hello CONTENDERS.  The Army&rsquo;s performance, once they disbanded the all black 24th Inf Regiment in Korea, went from losers to contenders.  Racial crybabies not wanted nor needed.</p>

Be careful not to shoot yourself in the leg with an unregistered gun or get drunk and kill someone in car accident. Just go home and beat the hell out of your girlfriend, wife, and mistress.</p>

		<p>I suspect that these overgrown children playing a child&rsquo;s game and getting paid on average more than top level neurosurgeons can always enter the actual workforce if they feel that strongly about Limbaugh.  I&rsquo;m sure that most could perform some menial activity like being a bar bouncer or work on a yard crew.  I hope Limbaugh does indeed by the team and calls these players bluff.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Scott said. &ldquo;A lot of us took it as more of a racial-type thing. I can only imagine how his players would feel. I know I wouldn&rsquo;t want to play for him. He&rsquo;s a jerk. He&rsquo;s an &mdash; . What he said (about McNabb) was inappropriate and insensitive, totally off-base. He could offer me whatever he wanted, I wouldn&rsquo;t play for him&hellip; .

<p>Gee whiz!  I used to listen to Rush years ago, and I can cite exactly zero in the credit column where this guy ever stood up and refused to back down on ANY issue that might have helped the pro-white, white nationalist movement.   This guy is a sell-out, and even helped to derail the first run by Pat Buchanan for President after he had won New Hampshire and was on a roll.  </p>
<p>Not only that, but I distinctly remember how Rush almost always refused to allow any callers to bring up the third world immigration invasion - unless they fibbed to the call screener and then switched topics, once they were on the air.   </p>
<p>I remember one particular caller who pulled this on Rush, and he expressed his serious concern for what sort of future his white kids might have in an America where they were vastly outnumbered by millions of non-European immigrants.   Rush then proceeded to barf out the Cultural Marxist baloney about how &#8216;America&rsquo; was a nation not based and founded on race, but one that was based on the adoption of a certain set of principles, i.e., the &#8216;propositional nation&rsquo; pile of malarkey that we hear out of so many of these left wing, anti-white liberals.  </p>
<p>Well, fellow AR readers - this article is a perfect illustration that this &#8216;propositional nation&rsquo; baloney is a bald faced lie.  This black fellow named Scott and the other black ball players who were quoted for this article obviously do not believe in, or support the First Amendment right to free speech, do they?  </p>
<p>Answer:  Nope.  What they do support is the standard leftist intolerance of any speech that they don&rsquo;t agree with.  Oh, and one other observation.  I am reluctant to hit below the belt here, and I am NOT a fan of Rush Limbaugh at all - but, the reality of the situation is that black ball players like Scott and the rest, if not for their African ancestors deciding to sell their ancestors into slavery - wouldn&rsquo;t even be in America and instead of making millions playing a kid&rsquo;s game, they&rsquo;d fighting over grub worms back in their native home in Africa.</p>
<p>Providing that their fellow Africans hadn&rsquo;t slaughtered them in the never-ending blood letting that goes on in that place.</p>
<p>One final comment.  I can&rsquo;t see why any WHITE football player would want to play for any team owned by Rush Limbaugh, either.  This guy is a race traitor and has sold out for his own personal material gain.   But, that assumes that white football players have any &#8216;principles&rsquo; or &#8216;ethnic loyalty&rsquo; to begin with, and most probably are just like Rush - loyal only to the almighty dollar.  </p>

		<p>Contrary to popular belief, Rush never claimed that whites make better quarterbacks than blacks do- but he should have!</p>
<p>Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that whites make the best kickers and QBs while blacks are better at blocking and being running backs and receivers.</p>

&#8216;He can do whatever he wants, it is a free country. But if it goes through, I can tell you where I am not going to play.&rdquo;<br>
================================================<br>
Will he play when he finds out no one else will hire him or that another team will not be able to pay the same amount of money? When it comes right down to where the rubber meets the road or the money meets the player, he&rsquo;ll play for George Bush, Rush Limbaugh or anyone else who will pay him enough to buy his dope and pay for his blings.</p>

<p>Hey Limboob, do you got it now, that there is no racial middle ground in this country that you can gregariously cavort about in?</p>
<p>Comrade Kiwanuka has it right you know, it remains a free country for the time being; also, you still broadcast a radio show 5 days a week that hits about 25 million listeners. Perhaps, you will now use that forum to enlighten whites as to why they should totally ostracize Congoball and the NFL?</p>

		<p>So now blacks are telling us who can own a football team? Who do they think they are??? I hope Rush does buy into the Rams! My son has been a Ram fan since 1972 and the Rams need someone like Rush. I quit watching football a couple of decades ago simply because of the antics of blacks on and off the field and the blatant hiring of mostly blacks on all the teams. Forget basketball!  Where is the diversity there? Most are all black. I am sick of the way this country has been going ever since civil rights and affirmative action came into effect. Whites had better unite before it is too late for this country to survive, let alone the White race to survive.</p>

<p>Rush is a smart guy.  He should keep his money away from the NFL and spend it in a way that isn&rsquo;t dependent on the views and performances of semi-literate Africans.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s a moron who doesn&rsquo;t know the proper usage or meaning of the word &#8216;oxymoron&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing contradictory about Rush&rsquo;s statement. Scott&rsquo;s bio says he majored in business in college. I wonder how much they had to inflate his grades to enable this affirmative action case to pass. Just another clown trying to sound intelligent by using big words he doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

		<p>Limbaugh is not a racialist (at least not overtly). He and his like minded ilk believe in individualism and they believe that the black man as an individual can overcome poverty so long as he maintains traditional (read: European) values. <br>
Liberals believe (though they will never admit it) that blacks are inferior and thus need The State one their side to make sure whitey doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of them. </p>

		<p>Saying white kids are beating up black kids on the bus, that&rsquo;s an important part of the fight against racism. Saying that black kids beat up white kids (something that&rsquo;s been a more common occurance in all of American history - therefore something more relevant?) well, that&rsquo;s considered racism too. </p>

		<p>This must be encouraged. Not only should blacks not play for limbaugh&rsquo;s team, but they should refuse to play against them. This will force the NFL to bring in more white players. Then they realize that white players are so much better, they get rid of the blacks. </p>

		<p>As someone who likes Rush I wonder if these player comments are more an indicator of which NFL team to root for than of anything else?</p>
<p>One of Limbaugh&rsquo;s supporters points out that the left often/usually &#8216;quote&rsquo; Limbaugh out of context in an attempt to embarrass him. </p>
<p>On Amazon.com there is feature where select reviewers can review a book before the book is made available to the general public. Geraldo Rivera&rsquo;s latest book quoted Rush Limbaugh, in an attempt to show the bigotry of the American right on the immigration issue. A reviewer pointed out that Limbaugh&rsquo;s bigoted remarks being quoted in Geraldo&rsquo;s book were taken out of context. The comments were actually the immigration laws of Mexico simply being read by Limbaugh on the air, and nothing more that that, as he was making some kind of larger point on the air. &#8216;Thanks&rsquo; to this previewer, the book was amended before it made it to final print.</p>

<p>Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that whites make the best kickers and QBs while blacks are better at blocking and being running backs and receivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually Madison, most offensive linemen are White and some of the best blocking fullbacks are White.  Also there&rsquo;s tons of great White receivers out there i.e. Wes Welker (Tom Brady&rsquo;s main go to guy)        </p>

		<p>I was never a Limbaugh fan. In fact I went to Southeast Missouri State with Limbaugh, when he was known as Rusty. I did however agree with him about his statement concerning Donovan McNabb. When Limbaugh made the statement that the press had anointed McNabb as a great QB, what had he done? Nothing! He had never taken his team to the Super Bowl, nor did he have success in the playoffs. It reminds me today of a certain individual being given a prestigous award before doing anything. But for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t mention it you may be considered racist. That is exactly what happened with Limbaugh. He stated the obvious and was crucified. Also, Michael Vick can recant his mistakes and he is welcomed back with open arms. Hmmm, I wonder if there is a double standard for &#8220;Black&#8221; and for &#8220;White&#8221; America? But keep in mind what Jesse Jackson said after the Reginald Denny beating, &#8220;African Americans cannot be considered racist because we are a minority&#8221;.</p>

<p>Like so many aspects of everyday life, blacks have made something far less appealing to me. In many cases they have ruined what was once to be highly regarded. </p>

		<p>So, Limbaugh&rsquo;s comments provide a guide for us to decide who to root for in the NFL? Isn&rsquo;t that the very definition of bigotry? Judging someone by their political views. Then we should use these player comments as a guide for us to use when deciding which NFL team to support. Because, according to the left, it&rsquo;s a noble thing, showing intolerance towards intolerance (and nothing else I might add - oh, and sex criminals) and it&rsquo;s Ok, even encouraged to show bigotry toward bigots. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think only white folks can be bigots or intolerant.  </p>

		<p>Rush Limbaugh is a 3 x married and divorced junkie that sole drive in life is materialism and pleasure. <br>
Rush can act like a conservative all he wants but he is a liberal. He believes in nothing unless there is money involved. He was for 3rd world immigration until some people sat him down and showed him how it hurt ht country financially (his words not mine).<br>
Financially, with Rush that all it comes down to&hellip; money. <br>
He has no children. He claims to be religious but seems to never attend Sunday services.<br>
Conservatism is more than money. He is always for war but did not serve in Nam.<br>
Rush needs to have this opportunity jerked from him. Maybe he will become a litle more conscious of the opportunities denied other whites in the name of diversity. Maybe something will make him measure right and wrong besides money making capacity.I have listened to him for over 20 years and never has he taken the side against a major corporations. They never do wrong. I am not against big corporations but no entity is always right. </p>
<p>But, he did take a hit for the team (whites) over the McNabb incident. He is not all bad.</p>

He buys the Rams, and then discovers he was wrong about blacks, puts in a black QB, and the Rams win big.  It is the classic &#8220;feel good about diversity&#8221; story and the NFL and MSM are in on it together.  Don&rsquo; forget that Limbaugh is part of the MSM.</p>

		<p>This is much to do about nothing of substance.  Most blacks passionately believe that all conservatives are racists, since we object to seeing blacks as the beneficiaries of the racial spoils system put in place by the American left.  Limbaugh is, more or less, a conservative, and a very entertaining and clever one at that. That alone is enough to make most blacks despise him.  He threatens the racket that allows so many of them to live off the rest of us.</p>
<p>If he were truly a racist he&rsquo;d want nothing to do with owning a sports franchise that features so many of these capering, preening, infantile buffoons. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, my friends, watching these sports on the boob tube just assures these racist blacks continue to get exorbitant salaries.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched the NFL or the NBA for 16 years now.  There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to participate in supporting these loud mouth, low intellect blacks, who couldn&rsquo;t hold down any other kind of job but janitors and car washers if they weren&rsquo;t celebrities.</p>
<p>Just reread what the black above says.  He thinks it&rsquo;s racist to complain about a mob of blacks beating up on a white kid, but not the black on white beating itself.  In other words, &#8220;We kin beat up on honkies, but if they complain we gonna call them racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely outrageous and nothing shows their stupidity more.</p>
<p>If you continue to contribute to blacks by watching them play ball, then you have no right to complain about them at all, because you&rsquo;re helping continue on feelng as if they&rsquo;re a privileged group. while they&rsquo;re free to denigrate whites anytime they feel like it. </p>

		<p>I no longer care about either Rush or the NFL, but it would be a load of fun to watch those black players attempt a boycott, strike or whatever. Apparently the word &#8220;contract&#8221; isn&rsquo;t in the black vocabulary. Refusal to play would be a violation of those contracts, which are <i>legally binding documents</i> (another concept apparently too complex for blacks). Though I suspect garnishment of those 6- or 7-figure weekly checks would quickly enlighten them.</p>
<p>As for a potential strike, I invite the reader to recall 1987. Three weeks of games with replacement players and that strike collapsed.</p>
