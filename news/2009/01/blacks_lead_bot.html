<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28545587/">Blacks Lead Both Parts of Colorado Legislature</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sharecropper&rsquo;s grandson Terrance Carroll was chosen Wednesday as speaker of Colorado&rsquo;s House of Representatives, making the state the first in the nation where blacks lead both chambers of its Legislature.</p>
<p>The milestone is most remarkable in a state where blacks are just 4 percent of the population &mdash; and where decades ago the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan held sway over the Capitol.</p>
<p>Carroll and Senate President Peter Groff, elected to his leadership position a year ago, also are the only blacks among Colorado&rsquo;s 100 legislators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Democrats the majority</b></p>
<p>His fellow Democrats had picked the 39-year-old Denver lawyer and ordained Baptist minister to lead them back in November, paving the way for Wednesday&rsquo;s unanimous balloting by the whole House, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 38 to 27.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A different racial legacy</b></p>
<p>Colorado doesn&rsquo;t have the same racial legacy as some states in the South or East.</p>
<p>But the Ku Klux Klan did dominate state politics in the mid-1920s, and Klan members once sat in the Capitol chamber where Carroll will wield the gavel. One floor below, Klan member Clarence Morley occupied the governor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>State historian Bill Convery said most of the Klan&rsquo;s ire in the legislature was directed against Catholics and immigrants &mdash; though Jews and blacks also were targeted by vigilantes and a cross-burning on the lawn of the founder of Colorado&rsquo;s NAACP chapter.</p>
<p>Despite its legislative power, the Klan was outmaneuvered by opponents when it sought to implement its agenda, including a bill to outlaw the use of sacramental wine in the Catholic Mass.</p>
<p>Term limits have churned up the membership of Colorado&rsquo;s legislature.</p>
<p>The House speaker&rsquo;s position opened up this year because Andrew Romanoff had served the maximum eight years in the chamber. Carroll beat out two other candidates, both women.</p>

			<p>However, many western states have a Southern legacy, because after the WBTS and several years of Yankee occupation, many white Southerners gave up on the South and moved west.</p>
<p>However today&rsquo;s Colorado is one where white liberals elect a mostly white liberal legislature that does affirmative action things like making one of their very few black members the head of both chambers.  CO has become the destination for white liberals escaping the mess they made in California.  It&rsquo;s the only state where the Connery initatives have lost.  It may be lost to Mexico forever.</p>

I&rsquo;ve seen comments here about nearly all-white high schools that elected a black as their student council president. Same thing. It&rsquo;s making a political statement, not choosing the best person for the job. (Remind you of any recent national elections?)</p>

			<p>This sickness has infected even the former Confedeerate states   &mdash;   the Chief Judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court are both black WOMEN.  Whistlin&rsquo; Dixie, they ain&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity is right, until around 2004, Republicans had controlled both houses of the Colorado legislature for decades, and in Presidential races it was virtually always Republican win until last year.  And much of the reason is lib caused Californication.  It proves how outside of reality liberals really are, they can&rsquo;t equate there own ideas and policy&rsquo;s with reason why they had to leave California in the first place.</p>
<p>For the white do gooder liberals, the equivalent of notches on the bed post, status and a endorphin fix is is showing how very much they support blacks.  The only reason there was a press release for AP to pick up on is they just had to brag about it.  I&rsquo;m sure they were all very self congratulatory,  toasted each other in bars and just all had a super dooper feel good moment.  </p>
<p>It really should be considered a mental illness however that will never happen as the majority of shrinks are do gooding white liberals as well.  Unfortunately it seems the only cure is to become a victim of violent black on white crime.  That being said some of these folks are so ill, even that doesn&rsquo;t cure them. </p>
<p>FYI â€“ Overall Colorado&rsquo;s black population is less then 5%</p>

			<p>Has anyone noticed that their tv has turned into a black and white model?  I have never seen so many blacks in my life as there are on television now!</p>

			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s best to have Blacks in leadership positions now while Eurowhites still have a demographic edge, and so a chance for ignorant voters to see how Blacks will attempt to make the USA into the image of our major Black-run cities before it&rsquo;s too late. </p>

			<p>In my travels, I have found Coloradans some of the most racially naive people in the nation.</p>

			<p>Yeah who exactly allowed this too happen. Who started it, when, their reson, why for good, was it a logical thing to do, what good did they think would come of it. Was it for other groups profitable benefits?, is the outcome their means.  The future will be wild.</p>

			<p>This is a clear case of institutional racism and discrimination against whites.</p>
<p>According to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation on non-discrimination laws, the disparate impact (like that the blacks are disproportionately over-represented in chambers&rsquo; leadership) is an evidence of unlawful discrimination. I wonder if any of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; groups will file a lawsuit to end this blatant injusctice to the white people.<br>

			<p>Dead on! Dead on Denver. Here in this neck of the woods we have these liberal morons who escaped KCMO and moved to Johnson County, Kansas, when drive-by shootings were happening three blocks away from their homes in WASPy Brookside and Waldo. McCain still carried Johnson County 149,816 votes to Obama&rsquo;s 124,142 votes. A margin that narrow,especially by someone so flagrantly liberal would have been unthinkable ten years ago. Although, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of McCain, he was at least perceived as the more conservative of the two by the average voter.</p>
