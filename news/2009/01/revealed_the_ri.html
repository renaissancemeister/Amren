<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jan/18/race-identity-britain-study">Revealed: the Rise of Mixed-Race Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anushka Asthana and David Smith, Observer (London), Jan. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One in 10 children in the UK now lives in a mixed-race family, a major study reveals today, raising future hopes of a non-racist Britain.</p>
<p>Mixed-race relationships are now so common that some ethnic groups  &mdash;  starting with African-Caribbean  &mdash;  will virtually disappear, the research states. Young people are six times more likely to be mixed-race as adults. Experts believe the findings, which come just days after Prince Harry was rebuked for calling a fellow cadet &#8220;Paki&#8221;, and Prince Charles admitted to referring to an Asian friend as &#8220;Sooty&#8221;, mean that future generations &#8220;will not see race in the way we see it&#8221;. </p>
<p>Lucinda Platt, author of the report and an academic at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at Essex University, describes the shift towards a mixed-race Britain as &#8220;dramatic&#8221;.</p>
<p>Half of all men in Britain who have Caribbean heritage and are in a relationship already have partners of a different race. The same is true of one in five black African men, one in 10 Indian men and women and two out of five Chinese women. One in five children belongs to an ethnic minority  &mdash;  a far higher proportion than among the adult population.</p>
<p>This week, a decade on from the Macpherson report into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence, Trevor Phillips, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, will &#8220;celebrate&#8221; the study&rsquo;s findings, but warn that there is still much to be fought for.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the commission warned against complacency. &#8220;We need to be alert to tensions within communities that may be exacerbated by economic downturn and to remain vigilant against discrimination and divisiveness  &mdash;  particularly across boundaries of faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s study, commissioned by the EHRC and seen exclusively by the Observer, shows that 9% of children are of &#8220;mixed or multiple heritage&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, they live with parents from different ethnic groups, or they are themselves of mixed ethnicity. Over the past 14 years the number of children of Caribbean heritage with one white parent has risen from 39% to 49%. Among the Indian population it has increased from 3% to 11%, for Pakistanis from 1% to 4%, and for Chinese from 15% to 35%.</p>
<p>Minorities also tend to be younger. While half of the white British population in Britain is aged over 40, half of the Bangladeshi community is under 21.<br/>

			<p>I always thought Mick Jagger and John Lennon helped lead the way in mixing the races.  They were both cultural icons who married nonwhite women and had mixed children.  I wonder what they would think about a future mixed Britain.  </p>

			<p>I guess they will figure things out when a bill to ban the Union Jack comes to their parlement and gets passed.  Likely that same bill will supply a new design.  I am guessing that the colors will include green and black and have a crescent in it.  </p>

			<p>The wording of this is ridiculous! Afro Caribbeans in Britain will eventually disappear from race mixing with whites? Hello!!! But blacks are not indigenous to the UK and never were. Whites are, and they are the ones being driven out thanks to so many non white immigrants. The white who remain, and are foolishly mixing with non-whites are the ones who need to worry about vanishing from their homelands or turning into hybrid mongrel race.</p>

			<p>This is why all the official statistics that show the UK as &#8220;2% nonwhite&#8221; or whatever fail to tell the actual story. The lion&rsquo;s share of white Britons is middle aged or elderly, not of childbearing age. A frighteningly high percentage of the childbearing population is of this mixed-race background alluded to in the article. The future of Britain is much darker and bleaker than we think. This is one reason why the BNP must be voted into office as the next Government as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>This is England&rsquo;s shame, for many years now my country has had the highest rate of mixed race relationships in the white world and it&rsquo;s evidently increasing. In part,at least, it&rsquo;s the product of a media which pushes images of mixed race couples at every opportunity even when - as in depictions of Victorian times - it is entirely inappropriate to do so. Even the BNP does not address the issue, probably because it knows that many of its members have relatives who are of mixed race or are in mixed race relationships - although in fact it is only the growing success of the BNP which might effect the psychological change necessary to curb this process by emphasing &#8220;white pride&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that the tax-payer funded Chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission thinks it&rsquo;s something to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; presumably he&rsquo;s not influenced by the fact that he&rsquo;s a black man married to an Indian woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;future generations &ldquo;will not see race in the way we see it&rdquo;&#8221;  </p>
<p>In my opinion, all these people and organizations are just anti-white racists.  They will not be satisfied until the last white Briton is gone.  How so many British people became so brainwashed as to allow these people in power is beyond me.  And again, they will never be satisfied no matter what concessions and power you ALLOW them to have.  The United States will have a taste of that in the next four years starting January 20th 2009.</p>
<p>The left began using race propaganda and the so called &#8220;minorities&#8221; as weapons to gain power once the working classes in first world nations achieved good economic status.  The political and other leaders who are urging more third world immigration to first world nations are of the left, or are agents of the left&hellip;.even if they call themselves conservatives.</p>
<p>The agents of the left include the &#8220;neo-conservatives&#8221;, GW Bush, John McCain, and most of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>May God save Britain, and please vote for the BNP!!!<br/>

			<p>And I thought America was bad when it comes to race-mixing! Britain seems to be the race mixing capital of the world. This is how high civilization dies. This is what happened to Whites in Ancient Egypt, Ancient India, and the pre-Columbus Americas(white-history.com). Whites have been overwhelmed by their own stupidity in various ages and did not recover in those parts of the world. The question is do we have the courage to not just make a practical stand against miscegenation, but a moral stand against it before Whites are overwhelmed on a worldwide basis?!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible this isn&rsquo;t all that bad. The white trash in Britain have been leading culturally for some time now, and ( since the British women marrying these black men are almost invariably white trash) the more their behavior is linked with blacks the less &#8220;charming&#8221; it appears. This has been the case with many behaviors here in the US which are considered &#8220;black.&#8221; The only thing working against that is pop culture, which glorifies this behavior and against which the white race has yet to be innoculated.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>This may be a cause for &#8220;celebration&#8221; as seen  from his point of view, but it&rsquo;s a cause for lamentation from a white Briton&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>This illustrates a significant point:   that while it may seem alright and unthreatening to have racially alien minorities living in your midst, just living their lives and going about their business, it becomes quite another thing when they are actually working for your destruction and replacement.  Almost inevitably, this seems to be the case.  If they could just live and let live, there would be no problem. But it doesn&rsquo;t work out that way.  If their existence in your midst becomes a threat to your own people&rsquo;s ethnic survival, then you have every justification to require them to go.  </p>
<p>When your guest starts taking over your house, and openly gloating over it, your hospitality is at an end.</p>
<p>That goes for Mr. Trevor Phillips too. If he&rsquo;s committed to the ending of white Britain and the race-replacement of its people, then  his presence in Britain is corrosive and he should be seen for what he is   &mdash;    an enemy of the nation.</p>
<p>If I went to Japan, say, and started working for the replacement of the Japanese people, and openly  &#8220;celebrated&#8221; the coming end of the Japanese nation,  how would they view me?   As a dangerous subversive committed to their destruction,  and one who should be removed at once.   </p>
<p>Why cannot the  people of the British Isles see this just as clearly?  Because they have been brainwashed by generations of  &#8220;teaching tolerance&#8221;.  As I said above, tolerance is fine, but not when it leads to your own extinction.  You have no obligation to &#8220;tolerate&#8221; anyone who wants to destroy you.</p>

			<p>This is certainly interesting. Many at the site are very angry at the non-assimilation of immmigrants. But since they intermarry now, that will even out. Eventually.<br/>
THIS must be what you want, when you say you want them to adjust to the indigenous country&hellip; right?<br/>

			<p>If this statistic is indeed accurate (1 in 10 children in Britain living in a mixed race family), then the implications are very serious.<br/>
 If as a &#8216;quick and dirty&rsquo; estimate we allow twice as many children to be born into &#8216;pure-blooded&rsquo; non-White families, then we have something like 30% of British children being non-White, a figure which will only increase in the future.<br/>
 Certainly, anecdotal evidence walking the streets of London seems to bear out the veracity of this study.</p>

			<p>  Yes, the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. People will always make distinctions among themselves based on their color or ethnicity. </p>
<p>As far as African-Caribbean&rsquo;s disappearing into the British population, don&rsquo;t count on it. Even if the ones already in Britain mixed, there are plenty more waiting to come from Africa and the Caribbean.<br/>

			<p>As a Brit myself, I have seen this sad phenomenon first hand, and can without a doubt say that these mixed-race kids are almost universally found among the social underclasses.</p>
<p>I may be accused of confirmation bias in my observations, but it seems without exception the White women I see with Black men, and the White men I see with black women give every appearance of coming from inner-city subcultures where the average IQ approximates to the Black average- these are not people the Blacks or Whites would hold up as examples to others of their race.</p>
<p>The culture to which most of these kids subscribe is the solely materialistic, here-and-now &#8220;bling&#8221; ideal typical of those of low intelligence. Crime rates are comparable to Black averages, and parental income is close to the poverty line.</p>
<p>What worries me is the fate of Portugal, where similar Black admixture literally eliminated the society as a Western power. If this can be confined to the lower classes, as it currently is, we may still be able to produce the &#8220;great men&#8221; necessary for advancement. The Government sees the fecundity of idiots as providing a voting base- take from the rich (typically intelligent Whites) and give to the poor (coloured), who will cast their vote where the money for tacky jewellery is.</p>
<p>The overriding determining factor of social stratum is still intelligence, despite years of robbing the smart to pay the dumb and affirmative action. The bell curve differences are perhaps best manifested in the subcultures that have developed within our once homogeneous nation. Smart teens seem to be found dressed in black and listening to angsty emo stuff or metal, and they go to the better universities and get better jobs, and they associate little with the dimmer bulbs who burn in a Black-inspired culture that utterly disregards future opportunity in favour of immediate gratification, that discounts diplomacy and discussion in favour of chest-beating aggression, and which prizes the display of wealth and showiness above modesty and decorum.</p>
<p>Those Whites at the tail end of our distribution whose intelligence compares to that of Blacks are perhaps lost anyway to the &#8220;melting pot&#8221;, with the rest of the  Whites set to become a class apart, simply by dint of intelligence. This may lead to a Mexico in the North Atlantic, with all that implies.</p>
<p>The cultural decay must be stopped, and the dysgenic policies that favour the spawning of these welfare kids must be halted before we become a nation of a handful of whites clinging to the treetops amid a forest fire of mestizo crime and failure.</p>

			<p>It scarcely needs saying, but what Trevor Phillips and his ilk are celebrating is not &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;tolerance&#8221; or any other liberal shibboleth, but the conquest of Britain by third-worlders, who mean to have the land for themselves. Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point? If race doesn&rsquo;t matter, if we&rsquo;re all the same, what does it matter that there are millions of &#8220;afro-Carribbeans&#8221; in the UK or only four? These people are not immigrants but colonists, and it&rsquo;s sad to see the UK, ethnically homogenous for over a thousand years, succumb so needlessly to multiracialist propaganda. Why do the Brits fall for it? It&rsquo;s a wholly avoidable evil.</p>

80 per cent of mixed race bondings occur between West Indian descended men and Irish Catholic women. This leads to England hating offspring,almost inevitably brought up by their mothers.<br/>

			<p>Well if two people love each other who are we to tell them not to love each other. You are no better then the blacks you condemn for racism yet you indulge in it.</p>
<p>Most people are very execpting of race mixing in 2009 especially in Britian where it does not have the same history of racism as other places. Besides if the had more Latinos and Asians over there that number would be even higher. Mainly because people rave over them more than they do any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>It 2009 folks not 1909 people need to grow up there&rsquo;s a black president (who most of you have no faith in for that reason) and there&rsquo;s not a thing anyone on this site can do to ever change that.</p>

			<p>What was it in world politics? the &#8216;domino theory&rsquo;? That once one nation fell (to communism), all the others would fall in turn after. This is what whites in Europe face today, but their very survival as a race is at stake. </p>
<p>The trick is to get women of color to breed with white men, or to not breed at all, at least, if whites want to continue to exist in the UK. There&rsquo;s also limiting non-white immigration. It&rsquo;s probably too late for just ending immigration. It will take both realities for long term white survival. There&rsquo;s also particianing UK. Leaving Wales and Scottland as a final preserve for white people. Of course the longer we wait, the less territory whites stand to inherit, best case scenario. I would call that the &#8216;grab what you can&rsquo; before it&rsquo;s too late theory. </p>

			<p>My first thought when reading this was what the quality of the white people race mixing is. I expect it is poor, as it is in the United States, and the post of Anonymous 9:50 seems to support that expectation.</p>
<p>This prompts me to say about race mixing that it seems to me grossly overestimated as a threat. Some people seem to believe that all or a majority of womenkind have a mental incapacity that drives them to participation in seemingly popular or trendy movements regardless of anything else, and simply, they do not. Those movements may influence them initially, but they do not have the power to override their internal standards for long, and in the end, they couple with who most meets those standards. Intelligent white women couple with intelligent men, mostly white, but if not, still intelligent and bringing little if any degradation, and stupid white women couple with stupid men, an area in which blacks and the usual others are highly represented.</p>
<p>The <i>real</i> danger is rather that intelligent white couples are not <i>breeding</i>. If, or when, total disaster occurs, we will not be saying, oh, damn, if only those intelligent white women had not inexplicably born children with those stupid blacks and thus bequeathed us with such a stupid populance, we will be saying, as a horrifying tidal wave of stupid crashes through the western world, what the hell were those idiots thinking, meticulously avoiding breeding, while permitting, <i>enabling</i>, the stupid to squirt them out like mad?</p>

<p>Your gracious &#8216;live and let live&rsquo; attitude means you have to do nothing, just look after your own affairs and let the chips fall where they may. And as long as you personally are comfortable, everything is ok.<br/>
Good luck on things staying a way which makes you comfortable.</p>
<p>My definition of a racist is someone who acknowledges the existense of race through genetic common discent and who simply wants to preserve their distinct racial indentity.<br/>
And a leftist to me is someone who denies racial differences and wants to destroy any differences(which they deny existing) by breeding out any differences(which of course never existed in the first place). So we can all be the same.<br/>
But weren&rsquo;t we all the same before this mass immigration started?<br/>
And calling us racists is just used to stop all debate(heretic).</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a newsflash perhaps all racial groups are racist in that regard (self preservation).<br/>
How about we just agree that there are racial differences and lets celebrate our unquieness. And please leave us the right to perserve ourselves, please, is that OK? It is more than what our leaders have done for us.<br/>
And if you really want diversity that bad, 93% of the world is non-white, flooding our nations with foreigners just turns a &#8216;nation&rsquo; into a &#8216;country&rsquo; of selfish individuals.<br/>
Whites fighting whites was always the goal of those who wish to destroy us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, we never had a choice. We never really do.</p>

Besides if the had more Latinos and Asians over there that number would be even higher. Mainly because people rave over them more than they do any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>It 2009 folks not 1909 people need to grow up there&rsquo;s a black president (who most of you have no faith in for that reason) and there&rsquo;s not a thing anyone on this site can do to ever change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing rational in your thought. There is no reason why Whites have to mix with non Whites may it be 1609, 1909, 2009 or 2709. There is no logical reasoning that race mixing is the obvious inevitable route for man to take. It is you who needs to grow up from the left wing brainwashing that race mixing will somehow improve the world. There are already mixed race places in the world like Brazil and India. People who like such &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; places are free to move there. There is no reason why nations like Britain where the native population is so old has to change.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Well if two people love each other who are we to tell them not to love each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>I advise you - in your spare time - to peruse the biographies of Barack Obama, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry and every other famous &#8220;biracial&#8221; (black father-white mother) celebrity, or online forums about &#8220;interracial relationships&#8221; (invariably white women-black men), and you&rsquo;ll notice two things:<br/>
1. The black fathers <b>almost always</b> abandon their mixed offspring (there are at least 10 or more white &#8220;single&#8221; mothers lamenting the disappearing act pulled by their &#8220;babydaddy&#8221; on Intermix.org.uk alone), and<br/>
2. The resulting &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; offspring <b>almost always identify with the black race, and hate their mother and other whites</b>.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how Obama praises the polygamous Kenyan father that abandoned him at three years of age, yet denigrates the white grandparents that helped raise him?</p>
<p><i>You are no better then the blacks you condemn for racism yet you indulge in it.</i></p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to desire the white race to survive <b>as a large majority in their own homelands<b>, so please bear with us.</b></b></p>
<p><i>Most people are very execpting of race mixing in 2009 especially in Britian where it does not have the same history of racism as other places</i></p>
<p>View some of the articles on the &#8220;Heretical&#8221; website, and you&rsquo;ll find that the white British soldiers returning from WW1, who&rsquo;d spent years in hellish trenches fighting an equally hellish war, weren&rsquo;t exactly whooping for joy when the West Indian, Somali etc men that had replaced them in their jobs were shacking up with white women:<br/>
There were riots! - but that was a time when whites as a group had a backbone.</p>

			<p>If 30% of births in Britain are non-White (a very reasonable estimate), then Britain, racially speaking, is at the same relative stage America was at roughly 25 years ago.<br/>
 Most births in the USA are now non-White.<br/>
Hence, it is reasonable to assume most births in Britain 25 years hence will be non-White.</p>

                 If you really believe that britain does not have a history of racism, then you know very little about British history (eg colonial India up to 1948)and you obviously don&rsquo;t know many English people (especially the older generation born prior to 1940).</p>

			<p>&#8220;It scarcely needs saying, but what Trevor Phillips and his ilk are celebrating is not &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; or any other liberal shibboleth, but the conquest of Britain by third-worlders &#8220;</p>
<p><br/>
That is exactly so.   They are &#8220;celebrating&#8221;  the demise of their host nation. <br/>
And the host nation is insane to put up with it. </p>
<p>From the host nation&rsquo;s position, there is nothing to celebrate.</p>

			<p>The trick is to get women of color to breed with white men</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Is a child with a Black Mother, and a White Father, any less mixed than the product of a Black Father and White Mother? In any case, it appears that Black males in Britain, are no different than their Black male counterparts in America. In the US more than 70% of Black women have their children out of wedlock, and most of them will remain unmarried. The sad fact is, I don&rsquo;t think it is a matter of Black women remaining unflinchingly loyal to their own men, so much as the fact that the vast majority go overlooked as marital partners by men of any race. Perhaps it is because many start having children young without the benefit of a husband? Either way, it hardly benefits White Brits who are concerned with the continuity of their people, to breed with Black African females. Mulatto children are still Mulatto, no matter which parent is black.</p>

<p>Nonsensical! The real trick would be to keep non-white men away from white women. By having &#8220;women of color&#8221; breed with white men would only mean more non whites! Would it not? As it is there are more young non whites in the UK than young indigenous whites. This is a travesty in itself, and more than likely explains why child bearing British women are turning to non white men, when already their own kind are becoming outnumbered in their own homeland! If I had my wish, most would be deported, especially the criminal element, and immigration would be limited. That tiny island is too small for so many non-white third worlders anyway.</p>

			<p>Grow up gentlemen! Marrying a foreign non-white woman cannot credibly diminish one&rsquo;s status as an intelligent, respectable, and patriotic Englishman.  Being English, I am proud of England&rsquo;s traditions; fundamental among which is our right to complete freedom of association.  This certainly includes an Englishman&rsquo;s right to marry whomever he chooses to marry, free of societal harassment or government intervention.  My wife is a Hindu, Indian woman and I married her because she happened to be the person I fell in love with.  She is the mother of my three beautiful children, my life partner during good times and bad and our love for each other is unconditional.  I cannot believe anyone would be offended by our marriage just because she is a member of a different ethnicity.  We are both doctors and judging by the services we provide to our community, I simply cannot be convinced that either of us are a hindrance to English society. </p>

<p>There could be no &#8220;English society&#8221; if everyone in England marries nonwhites.  A child with both Indian and English background will not have an English appearance and would care less about English  traditions and monuments than a child who is ethnically English.  I suspect the reason you read this website is because you have fears for your country; fears that foreigners will change and destroy a culture that you love and wish to preserve.  It&rsquo;s hypocritical to marry out of your ethnicity but want to preserve your culture.   </p>

There is something strange about his post, and its tone   &mdash;   aside from its illogic. Is Trevor West Indian? I do however note, though, that Trevor Philips also has an Indian wife.  Could this be the same Trevor?</p>

			<p>Hello Anonymous:</p>
<p>Yes, I am indeed a white, Anglo-Saxon Englishman with a Hindu Indian wife; not to be confused with Mr. Trevor Philips of EHRC, who I believe is Afro-Carribean (not that Mr. Philips&rsquo; ethnicity has any bearing on my argument).  I simply think that England correctly affords its citizens the right to complete freedom of association whereby an individual has the absolute right to marry whomever he/she chooses, without institutional discrimination or any other form of social harassment.  In fact, an unyielding commitment to fundamental human rights is one of the salient features of modern English life, and forms the basis of our Anglo-Saxon democratic system. As such, I do not see why it is somehow &#8220;illogical&#8221; to argue that marital choices have zero impact on a person&rsquo; claim to equality of citizenship under the law. On the contrary, I think it is decidedly silly to judge a person&rsquo;s patriotism (and by extension claims toward equal citizenship) simply on the race of his/her marital partner as you seem to advocate.  I think most logical people would agree that there are far better measurements of patriotism; commitment to abiding by the law, being a productive tax-paying citizen, volunteering for community/military service to name a few.  </p>

<p>By that standard, every actual Englishmen in the nation could disappear tomorrow, be replaced with Chinese, Hindus or Nigerians, and &#8220;England&#8221; would exist unchanged, as long as the Chinese, Hindus and Nigerians paid taxes and obeyed the law. That does not seem logical to me. </p>

It makes sense only to a person who has been totally stripped of all sense of identity and nationhood    &mdash;   one of the de-racinated &#8220;New World Order&#8221; cosmopolitans.  Thus, it&rsquo;s logical to him.</p>
<p>I am sure Trevor is an otherwise good person, he sounds decent enough, but he has forgotten who he is. He has been MADE to forget! He has abandoned his people.  This is how Those Who Rule Things want it. He is an excellent example of their Brave New World.  The poor dupe could not have gotten through all that lengthy education without emerging from it totally brainwashed.</p>

			<p>The terminology in this article is, I fear, behind the times.<br/>
The Thought Police have deemed the term, &#8216;Mixed-Race&rsquo; to be discriminatory.<br/>
It is felt that, in Britain&rsquo;s multicultural, diverse and tolerant society, &#8216;Mixed-Heritage&rsquo; is more socially and politically acceptable.<br/>
I kid you not.<br/>
(It must be nice to have a heritage&hellip;.I had one once, but someone took it off me and never gave it back.)  </p>

			<p>Anoymous,whilst I agree that most whites who date blacks tend to be at the lower end of society,I have seen some respectable looking whites with blacks.What is even more depressing is how these children that come from these partnerships can sometimes pass for white and then marry into other white genes,further changing it&rsquo;s pure nature.</p>
