<h1>Hill Republican: Stimulus Aids Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Hirschfeld Davis, AP, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The $800 billion-plus economic stimulus measure making its way through Congress could steer government checks to illegal immigrants, a top Republican congressional official asserted Thursday.</p>
<p>The legislation, which would send tax credits of $500 per worker and $1,000 per couple, expressly disqualifies nonresident aliens, but it would allow people who don&rsquo;t have Social Security numbers to be eligible for the checks.</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants who are not eligible for a Social Security number can file tax returns with an alternative number. A House-passed version of the economic recovery bill and one making its way through the Senate would allow anyone with such a number, called an individual taxpayer identification number, to qualify for the tax credits.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. Why on earth would you not have a SSN unless you are not a US citzen?  Can anyone answer that question?  </p>
<p>This stimulus bill is putting an enormous amount of debt on each and every tax paying American.  It is absolutely ludicrous that anyone who cannot prove that they are a citizen of this country would be eligible for any tax credit.</p>

			<p>     I believe all Republican and eleven Democrat representatives voted against this. Let&rsquo;s see how the Senate votes tomorrow.</p>

			<p>And could anyone, except for a member of congress, be so completely clueless that they couldn&rsquo;t see this coming from a mile away?</p>
<p>Republicans and democrats are equally responsible for their total failure to defend this nation from invasion and to secure the border. Now they pretend to be surprised that illegals have found they can manipulate those very same republicans and democrats so as to get their illegal hands into the public treasury? Gimme a break. Any outrage rings hollow when millions upon millions have been getting away with it for a very long time, and continue to do so. Every. Single. Day.</p>
<p>Some will be receiving bailout money, be &#8216;stimulated&rsquo; or rescued, and someone else is going to get the bill. White Americans are going to learn which group they fall into, real soon. So if worse is better, then the stimulus bill will put the pedal to the metal making it so. Better stock up on popcorn, the fireworks can&rsquo;t be far behind. </p>

			<p>I am about as Conservative as can be, but the Republicans need shut up and stand aside. They are not our friends or the defenders of America. They had their chance to advance their &#8220;Conservative&#8221; agenda, but they advanced a Liberal agenda instead, for six years.</p>
<p>I am sick of the Republicans pretending.</p>

			<p>So, how do we put a stop to this?</p>
<p>Probably clog the Capitol Hill phone switchboards again, like we did to defeat the shamnesty bill.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Republicans and democrats are equally responsible for their total failure to defend this nation from invasion and to secure the border&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Their plan is going exactly the way they want it, do you think either party has any interest in securing the border?</p>
<p>Republicans are addicted cheap labor. Democrats love creating new voters who will vote for socialism in perpetuity  &mdash;  and they get to dilute, tear down and destroy White America in the process (their ultimate goal, can&rsquo;t have those pesky Whites forming a Fourth Reich, can they?).  Of course, all of this is done under the guise of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and other Communist slogans.</p>
<p>Remember Wallace&rsquo;s words:  There&rsquo;s not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the two parties.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be better off tossing aside the popcorn and preparing yourself for the coming civil unrest  &mdash;   that&rsquo;s not fireworks you hear, it&rsquo;s REAL gunfire, and it&rsquo;s close.</p>

<p>You are allowed to opt out of the social security system for religious reasons like the Amish and a few other groups out there.  It&rsquo;s not that uncommon. </p>

			<p>What a great incentive for unemployed Mexicans to stream into the US!</p>
<p>  Our congress just keep advertising the US as Uncle Santa Claus for them. They just love to feel all kindhearted &amp; generous with other peoples money. Besides, a lot of these Mexicans and/or their children will surely be Democratic voters someday - and all this for just handing out the chumpy taxpayer&rsquo;s money. How could the congress pass this opportunity up? Sure some people will be upset but they know they almost always get reelected anyway with all the pork they dish out. Nice system, and with the corrupt disaster the Mexican politicians have made out of Mexico they need to loose to the US a lot of their pesky population.</p>
