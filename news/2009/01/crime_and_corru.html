<h1><a href="https://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/7787">Crime and Corruption at the U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As immigrant rights activists demand immigration reform from the Obama administration, it is critical to acknowledge that concrete reform cannot be achieved as long as the U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) is riddled with corruption and criminal abuse.</p>
<p>Crime and corruption at the USCIS formerly the Immigration and Nationalization Services, (INS) is the dirty secret few politicians dare mention within their vaulted rhetoric calling for urgent immigration reform that never materializes. Thus far, their hollow words and legislative tinkering over the last 20 years produced few results except costing taxpayers a fortune. Worse, this U.S. $2.6 billion agency, under the Clinton and Bush administrations, grew into a dysfunctional anti-lawful immigrant bureaucracy that invites corruption. The USCIS, often the antithesis of law and order, is a ticking bomb with potential to cause severe damage to America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years federal employees have been caught taking bribes or demanding sexual favors from foreign nationals in exchange for processing their applications to live in America. And for every corrupt official arrested, how many stop taking bribes  &mdash;  temporarily? How many dubious foreign nationals already bribed their way in? There is no real way to measure and exploited foreigners are reluctant to report these crimes for fear of jeopardizing their American dream. All this flagrant corruption occurs in large part because the USCIS is overwhelmed by backlogs from immigrants following America&rsquo;s laws stuck in the nonsensical and degrading bureaucracy. This is the madness called the USCIS. This is America&rsquo;s immigration agency.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<p>o In Immigration Labyrinth, Corruption Comes easily  &mdash;  headline, New York Times September 12, 1994. &#8220;&hellip;the word quickly spread through immigrant communities. Come to the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. offices of the INS (now USCIS). Bring cash. Buy the right to live or work in the U.S. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Smooth-talking middlemen took care of the details, bribing immigration service employees.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Every year dozens of INS employees are arrested .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an investigation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. during the past decade .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. found that the agency has repeatedly failed to shore up security weaknesses, even when corruption arrests have exposed them over and over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>o 7 I.N.S. Employees and 26 Others Are Charged With Selling False Immigration Papers-headline, New York Times, March 13, 1998.&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seven employees of the INS and 26 others had been charged with selling fraudulent immigration papers for more than $100,000 in bribes. The case .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. continues to raise questions about how well the agency is addressing its vulnerability to corruption. The scheme grew so brazen, prosecutors said, that some cash bribes were exchanged right inside the INS offices at 26 Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p>o Cash, cars, jewelry: Some corruption cases involving immigration officers  &mdash;  headline, Associated Press, September 24, 2006.</p>
<p>o Immigration Official Pleads Guilty to Falsifying Documents  &mdash;  headline Washington Post, December 1, 2006. &#8220;A Department of Homeland Security supervisor pleaded guilty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to pocketing more than $600,000 in bribes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>o U.S. agents accused of aiding Islamist scheme  &mdash;  headline, Washington Times, August 15, 2007. &#8220;A criminal investigations report says several USCIS employees are accused of aiding Islamic extremists with identification fraud and of exploiting the visa system for personal gain. The confidential 2006 USCIS report said that despite the severity of the potential security breaches, most are not investigated &#8220;due to lack of resources&#8221;</p>
<p>o An Agent, A Green Card, and a Demand for Sex  &mdash;  headline, New York Times, March 21, 2008. A USCIS adjudicator was arrested after he was caught on tape, telling a 22-year old Colombian woman, &#8220;I want sex,&#8221; he said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;You get your green card.&#8221;</p>
<p>o Top Homeland Security Official Accused of Hiring Illegal Immigrants to Clean Her House  &mdash;  headline, Associated Press, December 5, 2008. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even warning one not to leave the country &#8216;cause once you leave, you will never be back.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>For years critical warnings piled up, including when Michael J. Maxwell, former USCIS director of the office of security and investigations, in 2006, at a House subcommittee warned lawmakers that the USCIS is a &#8220;dysfunctional agency crippled by corruption both inside and outside that&rsquo;s trying to handle too many cases with too few employees.</p>
<p>&#8221;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the system is incapable of ensuring the security of our homeland,&#8221; Maxwell testified. But crime lives on at the USCIS.</p>
<p>Last December, former President Bush &#8220;expressed regrets about not achieving an overhaul of immigration laws,&#8221; but truth be told it is a tragedy that neither the Clinton or Bush Administrations and Congress did not accomplish concrete reform. Instead the USCIS perversely created a pathway to crime, in a taxpayer funded agency that benefits criminals. {snip}</p>

			<p>I once helped someone (a Russian Christian) get citizenship but no one there spoke English, the guy in charge of his case was named Hussein and his supervisor was a woman named Ling and her superviors were a Latino and a Haitian, now you know what I mean?</p>

			<p>My European wife had to go through this system after we were married.  </p>
<p>What this article doesn&rsquo;t tell you is how many of these immigration officials are foreigners (or at least minorities) themselves.</p>
<p>Witnessing the process, I commented to to my wife that our system of deciding which foreigners to let in is run by foreigners themselves.</p>
<p>Legal residency for immigrants is also sold by other immigrants.</p>
<p>These scams in the form of &#8220;schools&#8221; run by immigrants that enable other legal immigrants to remain in the country.  The &#8220;student&#8221; on an M-1 Visa pays a monthly fee to be enrolled in a class.  Nothing much is taught, but the ICE never knows.  As long as the student pays, he can stay.  </p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars are made in this manner by foreigners selling residency to other foreigners while Americans are none the wiser that any such activity is going on.</p>
<p>Our nation is truly bizarre.</p>

			<p>This is also common in CA DMV. County birth certs have also been sold.  The state response was it is becasue the employees are not paid enough to resist bribes! No wonder there is never mention made of character in elections.  There is none!  Everything is &#8220;for sale&#8221;     This is the consequences of worshipping the golden calf.   No mention of character or God!    V</p>

			<p>Maybe, just maybe the REASON government officials turn a blind eye to the crime and corruption in USCIS is in hopes of &#8220;SELLING&#8221; American citizens on that open border concept (North American Union). The NAU, it might be recalled, being George W.&rsquo;s private wet-dream. The government mouths will tell us controlling the border, and verifying legitimacy of Latinos being impossible, so &#8220;let&rsquo;s just leave &#8216;em alone&#8221; or something in a similar vein.</p>
<p>As well-known for lying and duplicity as our Washington officials generally are, would my idea truly be so hard to believe?</p>

			<p>The article stated, &#8220;&hellip;..offices of the INS (now USCIS)&#8221;.   This is partially correct. When INS was abolished it&rsquo;s parts were scattered asunder to various other agencies not just to USCIS.   </p>
<p>The old INS was composed of the Border Patrol (BP) and immigration services and enforcement.  The BP was transferred as a complete unit to the hideous Customs and Border Protection (CBP)cabal which is now in full cluster foxtrot mode. </p>
<p>The inspection side of INS was folded into what is even more hideous, US Customs.  This bloated incompetent and wasteful agency now performs customs and immigration inspections at the ports of entry.  Their &#8220;inspections&#8221; are at best a joke.  </p>
<p>US Customs always was a laugh of an agency, run by brain numbing political hacks lathered up with a heap of crime and incompetence, most of whom wouldn&rsquo;t know a port of entry from a p*ss ant.  </p>
<p>Customs functions could be performed better by rent-a-cop contractors and rubber stamp bureaucrats at one third the cost and many times the efficiency.  Immigration functions should go back to a complete unit of it own. That is if there were an interest in immigration control from DC which there is not. </p>
<p>The &#8220;services and benefits&#8221; part of the old INS was shifted to the USCIS as complete unit.  The internal (inside the US) enforcement part of INS went to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p>
<p>It was the services and benefits part of the old INS that was responsible for tracking foreign overstays and students. It failed to do so for a certain 19 individuals from the middle east.  Yet this componet is now preserved as USCIS.  The Immigration Inspections component of INS that did a minimally effective job was essentially abolished. </p>
<p>USCIS adjudicators work in sweat shop conditions, but they get paid reasonably well for it. Yet, overall moral is shoe top level which is mainly caused by the same type DC hacks who also run US Customs and Inspections. And a contributing factor is that when adjudicators were a part of INS they were authorized to carry guns.  This authority was taken away along with the extra money that went along with law enforcement.  The noses of a lot of adjudicators were broken off because of this.  It wasn&rsquo;t so much the money but the status they fancied they had as federal gun totters.  For me this was a step in the right direction.  We need to disarm more feds.   </p>
<p>The driving force behind everything that USCIS does is reduction of backlog.  Adjudicators are given only a few minutes to review and decide cases, and they must meet their daily quota. Some cases are pretty simple and can be expedited rapidly, but many others are not and one must ask how well these cases are scrutinized, especially in light of the &#8220;minutes to review&#8221; policy.    </p>
<p>USCIS is supposed to be tax payer free.  That is, they pay their expenses through fees from applicants.  This is good on the surface but for agency survival a steady stream of applicants is needed.  Congress will of course accommodate this need. </p>
<p>The article mentioned corruption in USCIS. This is not unique to that agency.  DHS, CBP maintains a web site with a section called &#8220;Badge Dishonored&#8221; or something like that.  Anyway there are always plenty of fresh postings on a monthly basis.  I wonder what the ratio of &#8220;minorities&#8221; to &#8220;white&#8221; is of those convicted.  </p>
<p>By the way, USCIS is the agency that gives us the wonderful  Somalis.  CIS has a whole crew that travels the third world in search for &#8220;asylum&#8221; cases that merit entry into the US. Don&rsquo;t look for them to pass favorably on whites currently residing in old Rhodesia or South Africa.            <br>

			<p>Pay a visit to a local immigrations office and the first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is the lack of whites seated in the waiting area.</p>
<p>The criminals who have hijacked our government sell their political influence to the highest foreign bidders and third world citizens don&rsquo;t question this, because they are used to this type of corruption in their home countries.  </p>
<p>Today our politicians and bureaucrats are all racketeers and most Americans still refuse to believe it&hellip;  </p>

			<p>                       In San Francosco yesterday, a bunch of illegals and their sympathizers marched on City Hall, demanding that all ICE raids be halted.They said that our immigration laws are outdated. They think that THEY have the right to decide what immigration laws should dictate.They wanrt to give unconditional ammnesty to all illegals, even if they have done violent felonies.Mayor Newsom wants to deport violent felons, but not any others.At least he has a gram more of brains than the demomnstrators have.I wish that he had an ounce more of brains (28.3 grams).</p>

			<p>The workers and supervisors at the INS are non-white because of government affirmative action hiring policies.</p>
<p>We need to get rid of all mandated affirmative action and racial hiring preferences.</p>
<p>People should get their positions based on merit, or not at all.</p>
