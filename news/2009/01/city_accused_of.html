			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Zambito, New York Daily News, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A city ban on hiring ex-cons for hospital jobs is unfair to blacks and Hispanics, a city woman claimed in a complaint to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>Shanae Leath, who was convicted for her role in a mugging nine years ago, lost her shot at a clerical job at Bellevue Hospital when her record came to light. Leath, 28, said the city Health and Hospitals Corp. ban discriminates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Years ago, I made a mistake, but my life is in order now,&#8221; Leath said. &#8220;It really hurts because Bellevue seemed to recognize that I would be a good worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leath&rsquo;s attorney Justin Swartz says the Health and Hospitals Corp.&rsquo;s &#8220;blanket ban&#8221; on hiring applicants with criminal convictions disproportionately affects Hispanics and African-Americans.<br>

			<p>And when city council passes a law saying you can&rsquo;t do any work for the city unless you live within the city/neighborhood, that&rsquo;s not meant to discriminate against whites?</p>
<p>Discriminating against whites is standard operating procedure. Discriminating against criminals is not? Perhaps they should wise up and call them &#8216;sex offenders&rsquo;? As long as the perception is (incorrectly) that sex offenders are white I guess it will be a-ok to discriminate against them here too.  </p>

			<p>Gee, being that most child molestors are white and child molestors have to put a sign on their car that says they&rsquo;re child molestors, shouldn&rsquo;t we logically conclude that this law discriminates against white people?  Oh, wait a minute!  I forgot.  I&rsquo;m a white man. I don&rsquo;t count.  Carry on, my little brainwashed, self-hating multicultural friends&hellip;</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t they have a separate but equal public service branches that hire only blacks? That way, they can practice whatever they want in their policies? Everyone else could safely ignore them.</p>

			<p>Discrimination based on educational level, English speaking ability, prior work history, professional appearance and demeanor also disproportionately affect Blacks and Hispanics.  From now on, all hiring decisions will be made via lottery.  Each White applicant receives one ticket, while each Black or Hispanic applicant receives two tickets to make up for past transgressions.</p>

<p>Well, as we all know at American Renaissance &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;/Black Americans can <i>never</i> be held accountable for their crimes  - it&rsquo;s always their &#8220;crippling childhood poverty&#8221;, &#8220;lack of a father figure&#8221;, &#8220;too much time playing sports instead of studying&#8221;, &#8220;not enough textbooks in the classroom&#8221; which made them rob that store, beat that guy, rape that girl, kill that man.</p>

			<p>Yes, it is discriminating.  It means that the Hospital has discriminating tastes, as they know that convicted felons have a high risk of not doing well at the job, stealing, absconding and what not.</p>

			<p>So the way to correct the problem, we discriminate against Whites without criminal records, who maybe have college degrees and are trying to raise families.  Put yourself in the employer&rsquo;s seat  &mdash;  which one is going to be a better, more reliable worker?</p>
<p>When you  contemplate committing a serious crime, isn&rsquo;t one of the deterrents that should come to your mind before you do it, &#8220;How will this affect the rest of my life if I&rsquo;m arrested?&#8221;  According to these Marxists, apparently that&rsquo;s not expected of them.  </p>
<p>Study after study has shown that Blacks will seek immediate rewards over long-term consequences, compared to Whites.  No amount of legislation will change those psychopathic tendencies.<br>

			<p>I remember a similar complaint years ago, that veterans preference in hiring by government unfairly discriminates against women, because they do not serve in the military in great numbers. Federal court rejected the complaint, saying there was no obstacle to women serving in the military&hellip;.indeed, the military recruiters make extra efforts to sign up women.</p>
<p>This complaint will go the same way. </p>
<p>Nobody can shed a felony by declaring bankruptcy. A felony conviction is forever.<br>

			<p>Am I reading this right? Discriminating against ex-cons means discriminating against mainly Blacks and Hispanics? Maybe I&rsquo;m having trouble following the logic&hellip; that if Blacks and Hispanics didn&rsquo;t commit so many crimes, they wouldn&rsquo;t be ex-cons! Their propensity for crime being the REASON THEY&rsquo;RE EX-CONS!</p>

			<p>There is no end to the whining or complaints.  Even after they commit crimes, minorities still feel entitled.  When you choose to commit a crime, you make the decision to give up certain things if you are caught.  This may include freedom, and future job opportunities.  If you can&rsquo;t do the time, don&rsquo;t do the crime.  I work in this field in New York City and there is no end to the complaints I get from blacks and illegals all claiming to have some kind of &#8220;right&#8221; to a certain job and certain job benefits&hellip; Illegals even complain about not getting paid vacation time now!</p>

			<p>A female committed a mugging at 19!? Maybe this is a clue to her future discrimination by distiction of crime, which is not based on race. But, we know what it looks like on the outside, but what is really the cause&hellip; </p>
<p>&#8220;hiring applicants with criminal convictions disproportionately discriminates affects Hispanics and African-Americans&#8221;- - -</p>
<p>No, those convictions are right on! No one made them commit a crime. They&rsquo;ll never understand if they never learn to be responsible for themselves and want to live better than what they are brought up around. </p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t my fault! <br>

			<p>You really know how rotten the &#8216;diversity racket&rsquo; has become when it is used as an excuse to foist persons of bad character into sensitive jobs whilst using the catch-all ace of trumps &#8216;race&rsquo; as the excuse.<br>
 Just sit down and think about it for a moment. - Opponents of the race racket warned us years ago that it would be abused to force all sorts of outrages - and they were right in every case.</p>

			<p>Hey, friend &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know where YOU live, but here in Houston, Hispanics/Mexicans are also OVER-REPRESENTED as child molesters and rapists. I got into an endless argument on a local TVnews blogsite because I DARED to point this reality out. At one time, CRIMESTOPPER 10 Most Wanted List featured 7 Mexicans, 2 Blacks, 1 White sexual predators. The general ending of the description: &#8220;Believed to have fled back to Mexico.&#8221;</p>

			<p>What people may not understand is that medical professionals who work in hospitals, nursing homes, home care etc. are required to do a background check with finger prints before being hired.  I am not sure if this is a law in every state but it is in Ohio at the very least.  Here, the individual concerned would not a have been given the job in the first place.  You simply cannot work in many health care jobs if you have a criminal record which includes felonies or some misdemeanors as well.</p>
<p>EVERYONE is required to get a background check prior to hire.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter what color your skin is.  So now is this standard background check going to be called racist too because it prevents too many minorities from getting jobs?</p>
<p>People just aren&rsquo;t thinking logically with regards to what truly is discrimination.  Those same people crying about things like this&hellip; I wonder just how they would feel if one of those people who should not have been given a job, is given a job as a janitor - clean their hospital room, then commits a crime against them when they are sick and trying to recover?</p>

<p>Someone needs to tell this Swartz that law abiding citizens have rights too, and that those rights trump the &#8220;rights&#8221; of violent felons.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this society that we even need to point out things this obvious?</p>

			<p>The EEOC is showing their racism on so many levels  &mdash;  by basically saying blacks and Hispanics commit more crimes (which we all know to be true), and by not admitting that this policy affects European Americans also, they are showing their anti-White bias.</p>

			<p>Actually to those commenting that when faced with a death sentence the black I.Q. miraculously drops 40 points. </p>
<p>If you have ever dealt with blacks from all income brackets you would find that it did not in fact drop, or is misrepresented, they actually most likely (barring cranial injuries following sentencing) always were in fact borderline mentally retarded to retarded. </p>
<p>This is actually factually true regardless of whether or not we choose to believe this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A city ban on hiring ex-cons for hospital jobs is unfair to blacks and Hispanics, a city woman claimed in a complaint to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank God for that!!!!</p>
<p>When I was a medical records clerk at a hospital that bills itself as &#8220;Best in the West,&#8221; I discovered that many of the men employed as medical records clerks had criminal records.</p>
<p>PS.  There were only 2 White medical records clerks out of about 50.  No wonder so many were on parole and probation.</p>
<p>I discovered this by listening to the endless babble of my fellow clerks that so often involved court hearings and life in various prisons and jails around the state.  I also overheard the conversations of numerous other affirmative action male hospital employees.  Many of their conversations revolved around court hearings, defense attorneys and various prisons and jails in which they had spent time.</p>
<p>Many of the women spent their weekends visiting their baby daddies and other male relatives and friends in nearby state prisons.  If they had not spent their workday making personal phone calls and yapping and yakking about their personal lives I would not have known of their criminal associations.</p>
<p>The day time supervisor was involved with a man who was serving a life term for murder in Pelican Bay, one of the highest security classification state prisons in the country.  She had 2 sons by him.  The boys were 7 years apart, meaning that she had one child, baby daddy went off to serve a prison term and when he got out she had another son by him.</p>
<p>2 boys, think of the genetics!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Human Resources departments are pretty much compelled by Judical and EEOC diktat to employ criminals because they are under so much pressure to employ nothing but non whites.</p>
<p>Immigrants are another source of criminals in the health occupations.  Who knows why they immigrated and what they did in their home country. In many hospitals there are more immigrants employed than Americans.  The hospital contractors are another source of criminals in the system.  Since these people are not direct hospital employees, who knows what gets in through the contractors and sub contractors.</p>
<p>I remember years ago at San Francisco General Hospital affirmative action security guards raped a patient in the parking lot.  I understand Grady hospital in Atlanta has the same problem of affirmative action employees raping other employees, patients and visitors. </p>

<p>It is very true that those who WORK DIRECTLY IN PATIENT CARE, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, from physicians, through technicians to nurse&rsquo;s aides must have a records check and are not hired if there is something serious.</p>
<p>But remember, many of those who work in hospitals such as security guards, clerks, cleaners, billing, central supply, the warehouse, the laundry,  food service are not involved in patient care and do not under go record checks.  <br>
Also, many hospitals subcontract out much of the above mentioned work to contractors who hire from the dregs, including illegal aliens and criminals.</p>
<p>Another thing to know about the professional certification process.  </p>
<p>If one has a record and admits it then one may still get the certification if the offense was minor and it was admitted on the application form.  Admission means that the applicant has reformed.  Many minor crimes are committed by young college age adults, so the professional certification organizations will forgive and forget and admit the person.</p>
<p>In my state, the nursing schools bring us very early in the first year to the disciplenary hearings of the State Board of Nursing.  We spend a day listening to the hearings as nurses convicted of drunk driving or whatever are suspended from working.  Others were suspended and have the hearing to be permitted to go back to work.</p>
<p>Then we heard various horror stories, such as the girl arrested for shoplifting cosmetics a week after her 18th birthday.  She forgot all about it and didn&rsquo;t put it down on her application for her nursing license.  She was denied the license not because she shoplifted but because she didn&rsquo;t put it down on her application.  </p>
<p>In our last year the teachers told us again and again that when it came to the certification process, as long as we admitted arrests, evictions, bad credit etc we would be certified. But if we ommitted the negatives we could be denied.</p>
<p>Affirmative action means doing anything and everything to hire the most unqualified, disfunctional and even dangerous applicants as long as they are black or hispanic!!!</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a male nurse who assaulted her.  It would be a clerk, laundry worker, janitor, food service worker or some other of the numerous hospital employees not directly involved in patient care. They are the ones with criminal records.</p>
<p>Be very careful in the parking lots and bus and subway stops at change of shift around hospitals, 24 hour postal facilities and other institutions that employ numerous minority workers.<br>

Just think about that for a moment, what the crime of &#8216;mugging&rsquo; actually involves - basically the miscreant has crossed a point in their own mind where they think that inflicting actual bodilty violence to the point of physical injury (either permanent or temporary) upon another human being is justified in order to satisfy their own selifsh motive of fattening their own pocket.<br>
 Would you want such an individual hovering over your sick daughter?</p>
