			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Gardner, Daily Mail (London), January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama might have been in office for less than a week, but the euphoria is beginning to wane.</p>
<p>The new President&rsquo;s approval ratings have fallen from a stratospheric 83 per cent to a more modest  &mdash;  although still impressive  &mdash;  68 per cent.</p>
<p>Washington analysts said the scale of the drop in the Gallup poll underlines the immense challenges Mr Obama faces in trying to turn round the U.S.&rsquo;s battered fortunes.</p>
<p>He still remains vastly more popular than his predecessor George Bush  &mdash;  who left office with around 25 per cent approval.</p>
<p>But there were signs yesterday that reality has set in following the wave of optimism surrounding his inauguration last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr Obama is facing an ugly battle with Republicans over his plans to bail out the economy with Â£515billion of taxpayers&rsquo; cash. Opposition leaders claim the rescue package relies too much on government spending and not enough on tax relief for families and small businesses.</p>
<p>In a radio address at the weekend Mr Obama gave details of his plan for the first time, saying he wants to double the nation&rsquo;s use of wind and solar power within three years and modernise 10,000 schools to help combat the &#8216;unprecedented crisis&rsquo; faced by the country.</p>
<p>The address was also broadcast on YouTube, where it drew 450,000 views and 3,000 comments  &mdash;  most of them positive  &mdash;  in just one day.</p>
<p>But the President&rsquo;s top financial adviser Larry Summers, head of the National Economic Council, risked angering Republicans last night by refusing to rule out yet another influx of government money to prop up the ailing U.S. banks.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;What ultimately will be necessary is something that will play out over time.&rsquo; Mr Obama&rsquo;s hopes of enacting the bailout with bipartisan support next month appeared to be fading last night with Republican leader John Boehner warning that his party could vote against it.</p>
<p>Senator John McCain, Mr Obama&rsquo;s opponent in the November presidential contest, also said he did not believe the package did enough to create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8216;There have to be major rewrites if we want to stimulate the economy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As it stands now I can&rsquo;t vote for it,&rsquo; McCain told Fox television.</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s new focus in the war on terror is also causing controversy.</p>
<p>While he plans to shift all combat troops out of Iraq over the next 16 months, many soldiers will find themselves in the thick of a new battle in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Vice President Joe Biden warned that Americans should expect casualties as up to 30,000 more U.S. troops are sent there to fight the resurgent Taliban.</p>
<p>In a TV interview yesterday, he said the additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan will be engaging the enemy more.</p>
<p>Asked if that means the public should expect more deaths, he said: &#8216;I hate to say it, but yes, I think there will be. There will be an uptick.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s one trouble with these polling numbers   &mdash;   either at 83 percent or 68 percent, they&rsquo;re way too high.  How much of both figures were media euphoria, combined with the fact that he&rsquo;s brand new, and that President Bush left office?  Not to mention fudging.</p>

			<p>How can you have an 83% approval rating before you even take office?  Did they only count the responses of people who either approved or disapproved and leave everyone else out?  One thing is for sure - Obama&rsquo;s approval rate will never fall below 13% and I think we know why.</p>

<p>The media&rsquo;s liberal bias (both here and in Europe) continues.  Of course it was fitting for them to compare Obama&rsquo;s &gt;60% majority support when he is just starting to Bush&rsquo;s dismal 25% which existed as he was exiting.  If the media were fair and honest they would be using Bush&rsquo;s approval rating (90%) which he had when he too was brand new in office.  </p>
<p>I am NOT Bush&rsquo;s biggest fan but all I am saying is that it is quite normal for new presidents to have high approval ratings (90%).  So now the question is why isn&rsquo;t Obama&rsquo;s approval as high as 90%, as it was for previous new president&rsquo;s?  </p>
<p>This is why I ignore the news and what it says.  It picks out the facts it wants to support liberal propaganda.</p>

			<p>Everyone should keep in mind that when a new president comes into office, he/she hasn&rsquo;t done anything yet for people to approve or disapprove of. Right now, APPROVAL = WELL WISHES. When Americans are asked whether or not they approve of Obama, what&rsquo;s really being asked is do you support him, and do you want him to succeed? That 83% approval rating represents the optimism and well wishes of those polled, not people who think he&rsquo;s done something good. As Obama gets further into his presidency, those approval ratings will continue to drop, because they&rsquo;ll start to represent the opinions people have on policies he&rsquo;s inacted.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love it. &#8220;Stratospheric&#8221; poll numbers, despite the fact that he&rsquo;s been in office for all of a week and hasn&rsquo;t actually done anything.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s <i>because</i> he hasn&rsquo;t done anything, which is maybe the best thing about his administration so far. </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s give the Black Messiah one whole year before judging him. But I daresay, by January, 2010, his approval rating will be doing damned good if he&rsquo;s just above 50%. In a way I feel sorry for him. But he wanted his little ego trip and now will come hard up against the brick wall of REALITY! Also you can count on one surety&hellip; the media will have him under a microscope at all times.</p>
<p>With every media hack hoping, praying&hellip; to be the first to find dirt on Obama, or catch in fumbling the ball.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t wory they will go up once he reforms this country and his policies are enacted we will reach some growth and properity. He will slip up sometimes but at least he sounds more reasonble than John McInsane w/ &#8220;genius&#8221; Sarah Palin. </p>
<p>We are ready for OBAMA to lead us:<br>

			<p>What?!? His approval rating fell from the 80&rsquo;s down to the 60&rsquo;s in less than ONE WEEK?!? </p>
<p><i>Mr Obama is facing an ugly battle with Republicans</i></p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll bet most Americans don&rsquo;t even know about that. What actually happened is that, thanks to the euphoric media coverage, Americans thought the very skies were going to open up and Jesus Christ himself, with 5,000 angelic trumpeters, was going to come down and crown Obama the Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, and when that didn&rsquo;t happen, people got disappointed. Why else would his approval ratings fall that much when he hasn&rsquo;t even had a chance to do anything yet?</p>

			<p>Well what did the masses expect, Obama to be like God and create miracles!?  To everyone reading this post, any President of the United States, not just President Obama, is only a human being and can only do what is humanly possible.</p>
<p>No President can create miracles.  It took a long time for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to get us out of the Great Depression.  It took a long time for President Ronald Reagan to end the the Cold War.  It will certainly take a long time for President Barack Obama to get our country up and running again, if his economic plans can possibly work.  Even if Obama were 100% white that would still not guarantee success!</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, would you want to be the President of the United States?  Personally, I would not want to run for any public office, because it would hurt my conscious to have to make promises I could not keep, in order to get elected.</p>
<p>I would rather be a movie star like Brad Pitt or Harrison Ford, or a major filmmaker like Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, or Martin Scorsese, or a business maverick like Ted Turner or Sir Rchard Branson, than be the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Personally, I wanted Ron Paul to win the 2008 Presidential Election, but his Libertarian views made him too radical for most of Middle America to vote for him.</p>
<p>I do not agree with all of President Obama opinions and views on the issues.  But now that he is President, I dearly hope, in a few years from now, he is able to get our country on the road to recovery from the current recession.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I want the Obama Administration to succeed is because if it fails get at getting America up and running again, Sarah Palin could be elected President in 2012.</p>
<p>I absolutley would not want Sarah Palin in the White House!</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t wory (sic) they will go up once he reforms this country and his policies are enacted we will reach some growth and properity (sic)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How about explaining to us &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; &#8216;retards&rsquo; exactly how his policies will encourage growth and prosperity?</p>
<p>FDR tried these same policies in the 30s and they failed miserably:</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan asks:  &#8220;&hellip;Where is there evidence that such a mass infusion of spending restored prosperity?&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Here are a few lessons from the New Deal:</p>
<p>In May 1939, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau testified: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;We are spending more than we have ever spent before, and it does not work. &hellip; we have just as much unemployment as when we started &hellip; and an enormous debt, to boot&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Economically, the New Deal was a bust, failing utterly to restore prosperity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/buchanan/090108_obama.htm</p>
<p>New Deal itself, with its shortsighted programs, deepened the Great Depression, swelled the federal government, and prevented the country from turning around quickly. </p>
<p>From Milton Friedman, Nobel Laureate, Hoover Institution:</p>
<p>&#8221;..The New Deal hampered recovery, prolonged and added to unemployment, and set the stage for ever more intrusive and costly government&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>What makes you think this time the same policies will work?  </p>
<p>What do you know that Milton Friedman, Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Bobby Eberle and Richard Maybury do not?</p>
<p>I think Economist Richard Maybury explains it best:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there are only two ways to reverse a deflation. One is to give a rousing speech with a lot of P.T. Barnum hoopla about a new and miraculous economic program that will turn the tide&hellip;.The other way to stop a deflation is to simply create mountains of new currency and pour it into the pockets of millions, who will then spend it, causing the inflationary effect&hellip;  get ready for an economic catastrophe, probably a runaway inflation&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>https://chaostan.com/bulletin-012009.html</p>
<p>Obamas policies are intended to create a permanent new class of tax-eaters, instead of tax-payers, who will vote for Democrats in perpetuity.</p>

			<p>The problem is that there is no longer much of a difference between republican and democrat-that goes for politicans and voters alike.  It is now a slight difference in the gray hue of beliefs.  Look at all of these white idiots with obama bumperstickers who call themselves republican.  What is the difference between them and democrats? That&rsquo;s right, not much.</p>

			<p>The obvious problem is that the American electorate has been so dumbed down and adulterated with the intellectually inferior types that a functioning democracy is no longer possible.  Due to the efforts of such notables as &#8220;our&#8221; new secretary of state and her ilk to broaden the franchise to absurd limits (soon we will have pregnant illegal hispanics given two votes to be truly &#8220;democratic&#8221;, one for them and one for the fetus which when born will serve as their ticket to permanent residency and possibly citizenship).  </p>
<p>Democracy, even in its best form, is a very imperfect thing.  Historically, it has only been effective for more than a short period of time in developed societies when the franchise was strictly limited to males of military age (those who are willing to fight and die in their country&rsquo;s defense),  own land (which is the only valid traditional means of linking one&rsquo;s fate to that of one&rsquo;s community),  and pay taxes( rather than one who receives the benefits of others&rsquo; taxes)   </p>
<p>What we  have at present is not democracy but mobocracy, or the worst possible form of government, one which inevitably degenerates into two successive stages, viz. anarchy and then tyranny.  This has been well known at least as earlier as  Plato&rsquo;s day (4th century BC) and has been the accepted wisdom of profound thinkers throughout the several millennia of the history of Western civilization.  The fact that it has been discarded as so much inconsequential rubbish, speaks volumes about the complete lack of &#8220;education&#8221; (really the ancient Greek &#8220;paidea&#8221;) of the &#8220;American people&#8221; (another convenient potitician&rsquo;s construct which has no instantiation in reality and never will.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment the necessary conditions for an Obama victory and ask yourself if such a group of radically heterogeneous elements could ever produce a reasoned judgment.  The answer is clearly &#8220;no&#8221;.  In fact the fundamental paradox of democratic government and elections was highlighted by a Nobel prize winning economist during the 1950&rsquo;s when he mathematically proved that any system of voting in a demcracy which mazimized the inclusion of reasonable criteria for voting  would always generate the same answer.  That answer was that only one voter should be allowed to vote and whatever he were to say would be law.  Hence, pure democracy not only historically but also logically intails a fundamental contradiction.</p>

			<p>Perhaps Obama&rsquo;s heart is in the right place, but it is not the job of government to &#8220;create jobs&#8221;.  It is the job of government to leave people alone so that they can create jobs for themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore it is not the job of government to dictate what forms of energy people use.  We&rsquo;re not a bunch of children so let us decide for ourselves through a free market.  Furthermore some of those alternative energy sources are not nearly as environmentally friendly as you might believe.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Obama&rsquo;s popularity will continue to fall as more and more people start to realize that his administration will just be more of the same.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, Mr Obama has overdone it with the black floor enamel and painted himself into a corner. Lesser black leaders with political aspirations do not want mere empowerment, they want a major share of power. In 2009, if Obama cannot deliver (and how on earth can he when the USA is eating into its financial reserves at a phenomenal rate) then the his main supporters will look elsewhere for the keys to that power.<br>
At street level, political allegiance must take second or third place when there is no bread on the table. The cowboy whoops, the tears, and the theatricality of Obama&rsquo;s victory are now yesterday&rsquo;s news.<br>
Perhaps Obama can use those old newspapers as something to stand on when he&rsquo;s trying to get out of that corner.</p>

			<p>How can those figures be so high when only half the country voted for Obama?  I also keep seeing things like Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;immense popularity&#8221; which again are false statements.  If Obama had won by a landslide I could see those terms applied but not when the election was so close. It&rsquo;s MSM generating lies and distoring facts to detract the public from Obama&rsquo;s obvious lack of experience, his basic incompetence and the failures to come given his track record. </p>

			<p>To be the Messiah, he has to be insanely popular, then have everyone get dissapointed to the brink of frenzy, when it doesn&rsquo;t turn out as they had hoped.<br>
A lot of my fellow Europeans just wanted Obama, for the sake of slapping white America in the face. <br>
But a lot of people here, actually hope he&rsquo;ll fail, because that would mean they were right all along. That&rsquo;s almost as terrible.<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe in his &#8220;change&#8221;, but I REALLY hope I am wrong. </p>

			<p>I am certain that many of you can remember another president that had record high approval ratings&hellip;..George Bush Sr. at the end of the first Gulf War (1991) had an even HIGHER approval rating (90+%) than Mr. Obama&rsquo;s peak. (I believe it was the highest approval rating since WWII.) Yet a year later, he could not even get re-elected as an incumbent president. He was beat by a liberal, but very inexperienced, Governor of Arkansas&hellip;.Bill Clinton. How badly? Clinton 370 electoral votes vrs. Bush 168 electoral votes.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than 200,000 job cuts have been announced so far this year, according to company reports. Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost over 2008, the highest yearly job-loss total since 1945.&#8221;  &#8220;Brusca said he agreed with many economists&rsquo; predictions that the recession will end after the second quarter of 2009. Americans might feel the job market start to bounce back a bit sooner than expected, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The job market that bounces back will continue to employ aliens who bleed America dry by sending most of their wages back to their home countries.  They have no loyalty to America, our culture, or our people.  The root causes of the recession we are in now are listed below, everything else impacting our economy are symptoms of these root causes:</p>
<p>The uncontrolled borrowing and spending by the federal, state and local governments.<br>
     <br>
The outsourcing of our manufacturing base and the jobs that went with it.</p>
<p>The massive outsourcing of our back office jobs.</p>
<p>The massive insourcing of aliens with work visas.</p>
<p>The massive insourcing of illegals.</p>
<p>Lincoln once said, &#8220;When we buy a ton of steel rails from abroad we get the rails and the foreigner gets the money, but when we buy the steel rails at home, we get both the rails and the money.&#8221;   Contrast this thinking with that of the Globalists who are willing to destroy or enslave nations simply to maximize their short term profits.<br>
  <br>
The congress, administration and their corporate and foreign masters are responsible for devastating our economy. They have launched an all out attack upon our middle-class. This has always been the primary goal of the communist agenda. It is the intention of Washington that this recession become permanent by morphing America into a third world country with a third world economy. <br>

<p>Democracy is ALWAYS a mobocracy, which is why are Founding Fathers rejected it as a form of government. We are supposed to be a constitutional republic.</p>

			<p>It would be a terrible mistake for White Nationalist to look for a messiah to save White America. The only long term viable soultion is highly interconnected network of highly vigilant and  locally based Native Born Whites fighting ferociously. Worshipping plitical messaihs and poitical parties always leads to a decrease in vigilence thereby allowing the party insiders to cheat and steal from the base.</p>
<p>Ron Paul isn&rsquo;t intertested in saving Native Born White America. And as a previous poster stated most of the White American population is not enamoured of  across-the board Libertarianism because it is  heartless and repellent. Because Libertarianism is ani-community and pro-greed, it is therefore fundamantally incompatible with White Nationalism.</p>

			<p>No President can create miracles. It took a long time for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to get us out of the Great Depression.<br>
Posted by Ross at 10:49 PM on January 27 </p>
<p>FDR didn&rsquo;t get us out of the Great Depression.  His policies prolonged the depression and turned it into the Great Depression.  Now Obama is proposing the same ideas as FDR - massive increases in government spending, make work projects, etc.  History is repeating itself.  And you claim you were a Ron Paul supporter?  Have you ever even read anything Ron Paul has written about economics?</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the main reasons I want the Obama Administration to succeed is because if it fails get at getting America up and running again, Sarah Palin could be elected President in 2012.<br>
I absolutley would not want Sarah Palin in the White House!&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama can&rsquo;t &#8220;get America up and running again&#8221;, only the private sector can do this.  Once again your claim to have been a Ron Paul supporter seems doubtful.  And what exactly would be so terrible about Sarah Palin in the White House?  Could she possibly be worse than Obama?  The only main thing I disagree with Palin on is foreign policy.  Of course, Obama has already shown that he plans to pursue the same failed foreign policy, so what&rsquo;s the difference?  In Obama&rsquo;s first week in office he bombed Pakistan and said to expect an increase in US casualties.  Is that &#8220;Change you can believe in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, &#8220;rational thinker&#8221;, still spouting your liberal absurdities I see. I also note you failed to rebut me last week on &#8220;Black first family changes&hellip;&#8221; when you bestowed on us your nonsense re those &#8220;21,000 Nigerian doctors&#8221; among other simplistic rantings. You never did answer the question I posed you: &#8220;Would you trust YOUR life, or those of your loved ones, to those Nigerian doctors&#8221;? I sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t trust them to treat my dogs.</p>
<p>Somehow I suspect Obama not only will fail to &#8220;lead&#8221;, as you put it. But will surely fall on his face before starting the second half of his term. He made too many promises common sense will tell you&hellip; he couldn&rsquo;t fulfill in TWO terms. Also I&rsquo;d bet lots of scandals in his and his wife&rsquo;s past will emerge to haunt the First Couple&hellip; like they did the Clintons. Obama, being Black, will probably make more than enough mistakes and bluders on his own. Haven&rsquo;t we seen just that with those many Black mayors of large cities of late?</p>

<p>I see this attitude far too often on websites like this and I really don&rsquo;t understand how it can possibly be compatible with the white preservation movement and what it is supposed to stand for.  </p>
<p>Let me guess, &hellip;.. you think Sarah Palin represents unintelligent red neck America (the segment of America that makes America look bad according to you)?  So according to you, Obama is somehow better?  Why?  Because the media has propogated this myth that he &#8220;is the smartest president ever&#8221; when he hasn&rsquo;t even done anything to prove it yet? </p>
<p>Quite frankly, from what I heard during the debates etc&hellip;, it appears to me that Palin is much more intelligent than Obama, who got to this point only because of affirmative action.  I am really getting sick of people in this movement talking about how &#8220;at least Obama is more intelligent than Palin and Bush&#8221;.  What kind of a person are you?</p>
<p>It looks to me like Obama is in for something way over his head, and even though Bush wasn&rsquo;t the best president, it sure doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to see that he was better equipped for the job than what we have in the White House now.</p>
<p>And for the record, I am from Alabama, which is a red &#8220;red neck&#8221; state and I am quite proud of it.  My ancestors fought hard to make this nation what it is.  Anybody in this movement who wishes to turn their noses down at people like me who cling to their Bibles, own guns and admire Palin, then you are alienating a very large chunk of the people in this movement.  Keep it up why don&rsquo;t you?</p>

			<p>When you put somebody at the top and keep him there through distortion, lies and spin, he doesn&rsquo;t have any other place to go but down.</p>
<p>Of course the sycophants, the ultimate Bush haters, the white college professors and their indoctrinated students, elitist celebrities and poor blacks will never wain in their admiration for their &#8220;savior&#8221; but eventually and maybe not this year or next, the euphoria of Obama and his hope and change and brand new day in America is going to go right down the sewer.  </p>

			<p>Sarah Palin is on board with the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. She is also Evangelical Christian who believes in the Rapture. Evangelical Christians who believe in the rapture are extremely dangerous people. They have brought death and destreuction to the Iraqi people and to over four thousand American teenagers who have died in Iraq. If given the opportuity they would start a nuclear WW3.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin is the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>And just where and how do you think Mr. Jeezy got his automobile in the first place [assuming that he actually owns it]; and, this&hellip;&hellip; is your conception of what America should be?  </p>
<p>And YOU call yourself rational. This site, sir, is rational, you sir, are not!</p>

			<p>&#8220;rational thinker&#8221;, you&rsquo;ve GOT TO BE A BLACK! I&rsquo;d sure hate to think a White person could come out with such utter absurd comments. Palin will NEVER be elected prez; she has far too much negative bagged on her (like Shrillary Clinton) to win enough support.</p>
<p>As to Palin drawing &#8216;redneck&rsquo; support. Me, I probably am considered a redneck for not buying into the liberal claptrap about racial equality and multi-cultural diversity as being &#8220;good&#8221; for any nation. Yet I reject Palin for her shallowness, her lying to Americans when selected by McFumble. McCain&rsquo;s utter stupidity in not having Palin checked out more thoroughly probably went as far to killing his chances of winning, as did his being seen as a peripathetic clone of G.W.B. and likely to continue Georgie Boy&rsquo;s failed policies.</p>
<p>Glory in Ombama winning, if it makes you feel warm and fuzzy. That&rsquo;s your privilege. But understand this: Obama would never have won had Republican Party leaders sense enough to see McFumble for the bumbling fool he was; and replaced him with Romney, better yet, with Ron Paul or any P-VP combination other than what was fielded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you can&rsquo;t post something intelligent, don&rsquo;t post at all. Because we all see you for what you really are when we read your posts&hellip; Either a Black, or at best a total liberal wingnut.</p>
