<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28738764/">State Senator to Introduce Immigration Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Rader, WTHR-TV (Indianapolis), January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Indiana lawmaker is introducing what he calls the toughest immigration bill in the country.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration has been a controversial issue at the Indiana Statehouse for the last couple of years, drawing heated debate in both chambers from both sides of the issue. Senator Mike Delph from Carmel will make it a third year by filing Senate Bill 580. The bill is designed to punish those who harbor, transport or employ illegal immigrants in Indiana.</p>
<p>But it does have a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provision for businesses who verify work status of employees by using the federal e-verify system that confirms citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the bill, businesses that employ illegals face three years probation. Second time violators face a 10-day suspension of their business license and third time violators face the permanent loss of their business license in the state.</p>
<p>While the future of the bill may be clouded, it does have a hearing set for February 4 in the Senate&rsquo;s Pension and Labor Committee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration has been a controversial issue at the Indiana Statehouse for the last couple of years, drawing heated debate in both chambers from both sides of the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And I thought there was really only one side to this so-called &#8220;issue?&#8221;</p>
<p>That would be the side that recognizes, that there is no such thing as &#8220;illegal immigration;&#8221; this is the side that knows that these are law-breaking alien invaders, with absolutely no &#8220;rights&#8221; and that they should be treated as such. Any who say otherwise, are worthless traitors to the United States of America and should likewise be treated as such. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but somehow I missed where the brain surgery or rocket science of the &#8220;issue&#8221; came into play.<br>

			<p>It has to be done if this country is going to at least have the rule of law exist. Already there is so much lawlessness that hurts Americans and they just don&rsquo;t seem to get it. We are allowing a handfull of communist far leftists, greedy churches, and chambers of commerce to destroy the nation.</p>

<p>Call and suppot Senator Mike Delph, for he certainly will now become the locus of hate groups like the traitorous La Raza or the mushy headed Catholic charities or Lutheran immigration promoters!</p>

			<p>This is plainly ridiculous. If this is a &#8220;tough&#8221; bill, I do not want to see a &#8220;lenient&#8221; one. It´s all smoke and mirrors to pacify the white segment of the population.<br>
-Of course, one has to understand the politicians also. Their Ten Commandments are 1) get elected and 2) through 10) get re-elected. And for that, you cannot afford to antagonize the Almighty Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>There´s something rotten in the state of &hellip; I forgot.</p>

			<p>Republicans had six years of full government control to:</p>
<p>- rid the country of illegals<br>
- secure the borders<br>
- rid the country of other sorted undesirables<br>
- eliminate and outlaw all forms of desegregation and affirmative action<br>
- quell the misery of diversity and multiculturals<br>
- toughen the criminal justice system<br>
- bolster law enforcement<br>
- significantly slash spending<br>
- eliminate social programs<br>
- significantly reduce the government&rsquo;s footprint and stranglehold on the lives of citizens<br>
- slash taxes and permanently amend/simplify the tax code<br>
- permanently end same-sex marriage and same-sex &#8220;unions&#8221;<br>
- cement the core principles of traditional Conservatives in America</p>
<p>In each case, they chose not to act on behalf of Conservatives. Instead? They did the exact opposite. Their actions were (and are) an affront to Conservatives everywhere. They did absolutely nothing to differentiate themselves from Liberal Democrats. Nothing!</p>
<p>The USA *could* have become the greatest country on earth, but the Republican Party sold out it constituents at every turn. Now, the nation is well on its way to third-world status; a Marxist Mecca for mongrels, undesirable, and self-absorbed minions.</p>
<p>Today, when I read or hear stories about the RNC &#8220;standing up to Liberals&#8221;, I want to throw up. They are traitors to America. They robbed the coffers and sold out the nation and everything that was once good about it.</p>
<p>Things will become much, much worse for America, my friends. Of that, I have no doubt.</p>

			<p>Agree with no kangaroos and Walt.  If this is tough measure I would like to see the weak one!  The law has no teeth;just hand slapping.  Like Walt,  I see &#8220;hate speech&#8221; police replacing laws as  a way to end illegal immigration; just put citizens in jail for noticing and for asking for enforcement.   V</p>

			<p>Maybe ALL politicians ahould look at California&rsquo;s financial plight. Would ANYONE care to prove that California&rsquo;s hovering on the brink of bankruptcy was NOT caused   &mdash;   like so much of its crime problem   &mdash;   by illegal immigration? Illegal immigrants getting undeserved home loans despite their being extremely poor credit risks&hellip; adding so heavily to the banking/lending industry woes. Bank of America, that &#8216;caring&rsquo; institution, for example&hellip; handing out credit cards for the asking, to illegals. Now stuck with unpaid bills the illegals ran up</p>

			<p>The question is not simply whether or not the alien is either legal or illegal but whether or not he or she will ultimately help or hinder the economy i.e. contribute more than he or she takes. I think that Americans with any modicum of intelligence recognized that the German rocket scientists i.e. Wernher von Braun, contributed far more to this country than they took. Of course, due to von Braun&rsquo;s affiliation with the Waffen SS, von Braun could never ho[e tp be brought into this country today - while we continue to open the doors to unlimited Haitians which have contributed so much!</p>
<p>Of course, we also have a resident race here, American by birth, which has long cost far more in governmental subsidies than it either has, or ever could, have the ability to repay. </p>
<p>Consequently, why some individuals would continue to deliberately want to marginalize this nation at an even faster rate than it is already being destroyed on its own is singularly hard for people of reason and common sense to fathom. </p>
<p>It will soon become glaringly apparent that the economic survivability of this country is inversely related to the degree of the politically correct bilge that has been water boarded down the throats of it&rsquo;s tax payer for generations.  </p>

			<p>  Indiana is the Midwestern state that seems most like the South to me. Maybe, because the Southern part of the State was a &ldquo;copperhead&rdquo; area during the War Between the States.<br>
I applaud Hoosiers for trying to establish a rule of law for immigration, rather than the government approved anarchy. </p>

			<p>I am delighted at the problems Bank of America is having because of their going out of their way to help illegals, but now we taxpayers are stuck bailing them out.  I live an hour from Charlotte and the president bought his own stock yesterday.</p>

			<p>The posting by Anonymous at 11:23 is 100% right on.</p>
<p>I am in total agreement with everything they have stated.</p>
<p>It is a very clear and concise statement of what the Republican Party failed to do and could have done.</p>
<p>The former President has to be ranked as the greatest traitor in US history.</p>
<p>We may not like Obama for a variety of reasons, and we may not like the policies of the Democrats, but the Republican Party and most conservative parties world wide have sold out.</p>
<p>There is not much to do except to express these facts and to sit back and watch the show, although it is a trajedy.</p>
<p>Yes, the US could have been the greatest country for as long as it wanted if not for the traitorous actions of our elite whether in government, business, or non-government agencies.</p>
<p>A pathetic and apathetic voting populace, a biased and irresponsible media, along with corrupt officials and you have the perfect recipee for the mess that we are in and from which I do not believe we will ever recover.</p>

			<p>This does not seem nearly strong enough to be, it just looks like more of the same  &mdash;  Once again, the Right nods at the anti-immigration people and gives them a paper tiger, while it hands our Country over to illegals hand over fist. </p>

			<p>Indiana is a farming and manufacturing state.  Indiana factory owners put up billboards on the Mexican border encouraging illegals to come work for them.  Indiana government and ICE support this illegal activity and locals who lose their jobs to illegals are in a state of denial&hellip;      </p>
