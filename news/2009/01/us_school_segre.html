			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Bigg, Reuters, January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black and Latino students are educated in U.S. schools that are increasingly segregated, said a report Wednesday that undercuts optimism about race in America surrounding the presidency of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics are more separate from white students than at any time since the civil rights movement and many of the schools they attend are struggling, said the report by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California.</p>
<p>A 2007 Supreme Court decision on voluntary desegregation is likely to intensify the trend because it reduces pressure on local authorities to promote school desegregation, said the report, which called on Obama to address the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Orfield said these trends were &#8220;the result of a systematic neglect of civil rights policy and related educational and community reforms for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason is demographic. As the percentage of white students shrinks  &mdash;  they now make up 56 percent of the school population  &mdash;  they are more integrated with students who are nonwhite.</p>
<p>Another factor is that residential segregation, on the rise in many parts of the country, increasingly determines the racial composition in schools in the absence of measures by education authorities to create and maintain integrated schools, Orfield said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orfield said little had been done in recent years to prosecute violations of the Fair Housing Act, which forbids discrimination in the allocation of housing and was set up to foster equality in the housing market.</p>
<p>As a result of the trend, 39 percent of black students and 40 percent of students from the fast-growing Latino minority are increasingly isolated in schools in which there is little racial mixing, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report also found that the average black and Latino student is now in a school that has nearly 60 percent of students from families who are near or below the poverty line.</p>

								<h2>Press Release: School Resegregation and Civil Rights Challenges for the Obama Administration: A New Report from the Civil Rights Project at UCLA</h2>

<p>Los Angeles  &mdash;  January 14, 2009  &mdash;  As the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday and the Inauguration of this nation&rsquo;s first African American President approach, the nation is in a celebratory mood about progress on race relations. The election of Barack Obama is a breakthrough that would have been unimaginable a half century ago and a triumph of the long movement for racial justice. But a new report from the Civil Rights Project, Reviving the Goal of an Integrated Society: A 21st Century Challenge, points out that it would be wrong to assume that our nation has now realized Dr. King&rsquo;s dream and created a society where race no longer matters. In fact, the report concludes the opposite: the U.S. continues to move backward toward increasing minority segregation in highly unequal schools; the job situation remains especially bleak for American blacks, and Latinos have a college completion rate that is shockingly low. At the same time, very little is being done to address large scale challenges such as continuing discrimination in the housing and home finance markets, among other differences across racial lines.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s author, Professor Gary Orfield, commented, &#8220;It would be a tragedy if the country assumed from the Obama election that the problems of race have been solved, when many inequalities are actually deepening. The lesson to take from this is that we have elected a brilliant president, who is the product of excellent integrated schools and colleges. We should work hard to extend such opportunities to and develop the talents of the millions of blacks and Latinos who still face isolation and denial of an equal chance. The outgoing administration has left the machinery of civil rights justice and educational equity in a shambles and strong leadership will be needed to restore it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more than a decade, the Civil Rights Project has been issuing regular reports on the nation&rsquo;s progress in realizing the goal of the Brown decision and the historic 1964 Civil Rights ActÑthe aim that the nation end separate but unequal education and create schools that are integrated and successful for all children. Very large progress was made during the civil rights era but it is slipping away year by year. Since the Supreme Court reversed course in 1991 and authorized return to segregated neighborhood schools, there has been an increase in segregation every year, particularly for black and Latino students. The report shows that 40% of Latinos and 39% of blacks now attend intensely segregated schools. The average black and Latino student is now in a school that has nearly 60% of students from families who are near or below the poverty line. These doubly segregated schools by race and poverty have weaker teaching forces, much more student instability, more students who come to school not speaking English and many other characteristics related to family and neighborhood poverty and isolation that make for challenging educational environments. These are the schools where much of the nation&rsquo;s dropout crisis is concentrated. More than 40 years after passage of the Fair Housing Act, there continues to be almost no serious enforcement against widespread housing discrimination, which impacts the segregation in districts with neighborhood school policies, and is making it difficult to maintain integration in suburbia.</p>
<p>The country has experienced a large increase in students attending multiracial schools, defined here as schools with more than a tenth of students from each of three or more racial groups. These are schools that can either be integrated across racial and class lines or schools that combine three highly impoverished communities of different racial backgrounds. They offer both challenges and possibilities, but almost no attention is being paid to studying them or to developing curriculum and training to help realize their possibilities. The substantial increase of whites attending multiracial schoolsÑthe percentage of white students in such schools has doubled in less than two decadesÑ may well be one of the reasons why whites tend to believe that progress is being made on integration even as segregation deepens, on average, for black and Latino students.</p>
<p>The report also indicates that the frontier of racial change and school resegregation is now in the suburbs, where about a third of black and Latino students attend school. Even though there is a large white majority in suburban schools, two million black and Latino suburban students currently attend highly segregated schools. By contrast, only 2% of suburban white students attend these same segregated minority schools, while a majority attends suburban schools with at least 80% of white students. After two decades of a hostile Supreme Court and two terms of a presidency committed to reversing civil rights gains, only the nation&rsquo;s small towns and rural areas retain substantially integrated schools.</p>
<p>The report concludes that efforts to make separate schools equal, which have been the dominant approach since the federal government abandoned significant positive support for integration almost three decades ago, have failed. This failure includes No Child Left Behind, which was supposed to quickly equalize achievement across racial lines but has fallen far short. Instead, it is sanctioning scores of segregated minority schools without providing them enough help to make a difference. The report notes that too often the high hopes accompanying a racial change in leadershipÑwhen, for example, black or Latino mayors and school superintendents were first appointed  &mdash;  were often disappointed since the underlying racial barriers to opportunity were not addressed. Orfield, the report&rsquo;s author, calls on the incoming Obama Administration to &#8220;make the first serious commitment since President Johnson&rsquo;s Administration and build successfully integrated communities and schools wherever there are feasible opportunities.&#8221; The report includes a discussion of a number of possible tools and techniques with the potential to extend past successes. Finally, the report calls on the new administration and Congress to review the evidence and provide the needed leadership, for example, to support integrated communities and to avoid the large-scale ghettoization of suburbia.</p>
<p><b>About The Civil Rights Project at UCLA</b></p>
<p>Founded in 1996 by former Harvard professors Gary Orfield and Christopher Edley Jr., the Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles is now co-directed by Orfield and Patricia Gándara, professors at UCLA. Its mission is to create a new generation of research in social science and law, on the critical issues of civil rights and equal opportunity for racial and ethnic groups in the United States. It has commissioned more than 400 studies, published 14 books and issued numerous reports from authors at universities and research centers across the country. The Supreme Court, in its 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision upholding affirmative action, cited the Civil Rights Project&rsquo;s research. The CRP&rsquo;s Initiative on School Integration, which conducted this research, is made possible with the support of the Open Society Institute and the Ford Foundation.<br>

		<p>Again, what are they proposing to do?  After all, white ethnonationalism isn&rsquo;t that big because so many whites are able to flee the problem.  If the &#8220;Civil Rights Project of the University of California&#8221; has anything to do with it, there will be desegregation on a level that will boggle the minds of even its proponents.  That will only serve to re-energize the white racial right wing, Council of Conservative Citizens et al.</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the problem is the Civil Rights Project&rsquo;s perspective.  There are hardly any white school aged children left in the big cities of California, so of course blacks and Hispanics are going to be isolated because they&rsquo;re the only children.</p>

		<p>Legislation can easily fix this just like the laws that keep schools safe from guns and drugs out of the hands of college students.  Yes! that will fix the problem, more laws, more legislation; politicians always fix our problems.</p>

		<p>Black &amp; latino students may be getting more isolated from white students, but white students are NOT isolated from black &amp; latino students.  There just aren&rsquo;t enough whites to guarantee that every minority student gets to sit in a &#8220;perfectly&#8221; integrated classroom. Almost all whites attend integrated schools and all who do have suffered terribly from the collapse in academic standards caused by the presence of blacks and latinos.  White students suffer as well from the social pathologies which blacks and latinos introduce into any environment in which they are present: violence, degraded language, misogyny, sexual aggression &amp; promiscuity, and many other things familiar to the parents of white students in integrated schools.  Tragically, there are very few, if any, all white schools left in this nation, due to the efforts of do-gooders like Gary Orfield.</p>

		<p>While the article mentions the fact that only 56 percent of school kids are white, it completely ignores the fact that a good many of the white students attend private schools.</p>
<p>This means that a majority of the kids in public schools nationwide are either black or Hispanic. It is funny how they do not see black and Hispanic as racial integration.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not racial integration that they really want to talk about&hellip;..otherwise black and Hispanic would fit the bill perfectly. What they want instead is ECONOMIC integration, that is why they do not mention all the low and working class whites that still attend public schools. Why? Because they are so few.</p>
<p>Here in Texas, any Hispanic that attends local schools for two years is classified as WHITE. I took a job in Burnet, outside of Austin, where the official statistics said the local schools were 5 percent Hispanic. When I went to pick up my kids at school, it looked more like 50 percent Hispanic. So I asked the Superintendent and that is what he told me&hellip;..after two years, they are no longer Hispanic&hellip;.they are WHITE.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, sugar. There is plenty of racial integration in public schools.<br>

		<p>The Hispanic situation is EASILY remedied: deportation and the passing of legislation clarifying that anchor babies born to illegals are not US citizens.</p>
<p>The Black situation is problematic because Blacks WANT segregation and will assault ANY non-blacks in a school setting to put them in their place.</p>

		<p>Gary Orfield? I wonder if he is related to Myron Orfield, a goofball who used to run a messy office at the University of Minnesota called the Institute on Race and Poverty. Myron made a career out of harrassing white people with school integration. If so, must be the family business.</p>

Required liberal weasel words when talking about schools and race:</p>
<p>1.  &#8220;Segregated&#8221;:  Although it can mean something that happens passively and impersonally, the liberal requirement is to imply that it is being done on purpose and in an unfair way. And that action is needed to reverse it. The word &#8220;separated&#8221; is not allowed because that implies a neutral point of view.</p>
<p>2.  &#8220;Integrated&#8221;:  This means that a school has a mixture of races. But (as Memphomaniac points out) it is only used to mean that whites and blacks are mixed together. A school with blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, but no whites, is not integrated. &#8220;Integrated&#8221; is the final desirable state of things being mixed together to form a unified whole  &mdash;   the word &#8220;completed&#8221; could almost be used in its place.<br>

		<p>How ironic is it that the whole stimulus that got White America into its current (irretrievable) morass was the Brown vs. Board of Education decision roughly 50 years ago. <br>
  And of course the instigators of that action succeeded, succeeded beyond their wildest dreams! Not content with getting their way (and more with affirmation action privelege legally giving them &#8216;protected&rsquo; status), they got to destroy whitey!, yes destroy big, evil whitey the oppressor and slave-driver! - you see, whitey&rsquo;s kids are only 56% of the popualtion and will vanish to nothingness soon.<br>
  So a nice pice of judicious activism, wailing and gnashing of teeth, screaming, shouting and stamping your feet and getting the &#8216;great and good&rsquo; to back you to the hilt yields the richest of dividends.<br>
 There must be a moral in that somewhere.</p>

		<p>well, you see not all the news is bad. now we just have to seal off primarily white schools from the &#8220;segregated&#8221; schools. We&rsquo;re back where we started, and maybe America can regain an educated core of citizens who can invent the products of the future and run a civilized society.  </p>
<p>Or, perhaps the Great Leader Obama will require us to live in black or hispanic areas to &#8220;integrate&#8221; the schools.</p>

		<p>My kid&rsquo;s school is mostly white with about 25% minority.  The school programs always have to include a little bit of rap and of course they worship Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks.  My daughter is already &#8220;getting hit on&#8221; by an aggressive mestizo and she&rsquo;s only 9.  Also these little elementary school kids are using the &#8220;f&#8221; word already.  Yes my kids are very integrated in our multiculturalist society and it&rsquo;s distressing.    </p>

Busing didnt work, new schools and throwing billions at the problem didnt work. <br>
The next step is to take down whitey. Damn those white racists doing better in schools and everything else.</p>

		<p>More Marxist Common Purpose lunatic claptrap and barefaced deceit.  </p>
<p>Segregation <b>is</b> natural and for the protection of vulnerable ethnicities like whites, it should be made mandatory.</p>
<p>The sooner this whole deranged Marxist deck of cards collapses the better then we can all get back to following what nature intended - segregated living spaces <b>and</b> in separate territories.</p>
<p><b>Forced</b> integration is criminal and it&rsquo;s white families who are being pressed into submitting to it.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The substantial increase of whites attending multiracial schoolsÑthe percentage of white students in such schools has doubled in less than two decadesÑ may well be one of the reasons why whites tend to believe that progress is being made on integration even as segregation deepens, on average, for black and Latino students.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>1.  If white attendance has doubled, the reason will be because more and more white parents are losing their jobs to cheap labour non-whites and non-white illegals alike, leaving them no choice but to send their children to multi-culti hell holes or be prosecuted for non-attendance.</p>
<p>2.  The only gull-heads to go on believe progress is being made even though they themselves admit to a deepening of black and Latino segregation, are brainwashed and deranged white Marxist Liberals with an agenda, not your average man in the street who has far more intelligence, it would appear.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;By contrast, only 2% of suburban white students attend these same segregated minority schools, while a majority attends suburban schools with at least 80% of white students.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The only reason the 2% of white children attend mixed <b>non-white</b> minority schools at all, is very obviously because they&rsquo;re children from low income/welfare families who can&rsquo;t afford to send them to surburban schools in the first place which proves the reality that, </p>
<p>Birds of a feather&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The report also indicates that the frontier of racial change and school resegregation is now in the suburbs, where about a third of black and Latino students attend school.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Proving that integration is unnatural.  Even well-to-do black and Latino parents want their children to attend segregated schools.</p>
<p>Wakey, wakey, you wacko Marxist Liberal clowns!  Remember,</p>
<p>Communism in the guise of Liberalism, is as much an anachorism <b>and</b> abomination to other cultures as it is to white European culture(s), the collective founding culture, by the way.</p>
<p>Finally, Martin Luther&rsquo;s dream was just that - a dream.  He obviously lacked the intelligence to comprehend that such a dream is unnatural in the first instance and besides, he was a Communist with an agenda too, ie, the genocide of white people chiefly through miscegenation.<br>

		<p>The most widely used measure of segregation is the dissimilarity index.  Yet, nowhere in this article above do I see mention of it.  The authors of the report are waving their hands and not using correct statistical methodology, in my opinion.</p>
<p>At one point they say that today a majority of white children attend schools that are over 80% white.  And somehow this statements is supposed to help prove that there is more segregation today.  I&rsquo;ve looked up the statistics myself from nces.ed.gov/ccd and I can tell you that from a white child&rsquo;s perspective, public schools are progressively getting more racially integrated every year.  But the UCLA authors don&rsquo;t give us a specific year-by-year comparison in their data.  They are quoting numbers without telling us how they are relevant or where they came from.</p>

		<p>Re Myron Orfield&hellip;I knew the guy. He and his family are pretty well off and his father made a small fortune in real estate in Minneapolis. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how but I heard it was through manipulations in section 8 housing. The guy is not to be believed. He is one of those white guys with nothing better to do than cry for the blacks so much someone listens and gives him a cushy civil service job. He went to the U of Chicago and probably picked up his moves from the same &#8220;radicals&#8221; who got rich organizing communities. <br>
Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it, to hear how whitey&rsquo;s kids are responsible for black and brown failure by merely going to the school of their choice. Are the white kids supposed to the black kids&rsquo; homework, too? </p>

		<p>One of the previous posters noted the increase in the number of white children attending non-public schools.  There has also been a huge increase in the number of white children being home-schooled.  </p>
<p>But I have never seen any statistics on the percentage of WHITE children who are now outside the public school system.  The statistics that I have seen in the past always seemed to indicate that the percentage of children (of all races) attending private/parochial schools in America was holding steady at around 8 or 9%.  The only way that I can see this being true is if the number of white Catholics sending their children to Catholic school has slowly declined in sync with the number of white protestants opting for home schooling or private/parochial schools.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any information on that?</p>

		<p>In Chicago they have basically given up on intergration, outside of the magnet schools there basically are no white kids except in some isolated elementary schools which are mainly white neighborhoods.  The radicals being only anti-white allow the regular high schools to re-segregate to save on the police budget of keeping gang bangers apart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks and Hispanics are more separate from white students than at any time since the civil rights movement and many of the schools they attend are struggling, said the report by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if that nonsense upsets this yellow journalist and his liberal rag, try this on for size:  There&rsquo;s going to even be MORE segregation from whites.  Of course, he can help by sending his rug rats to a school in the ghetto so they can learn first hand the joys of diversity.<br>

		<p>Thank Wotan that we are less mixed now than before.  If their schools fail, it is because they make them fail.  Non whites, orientals withstanding, are not intellectual and preform poorly in schools.  It is not the segregation that ruins the schools, but the presence of non whites that ruin them.  </p>

		<p>About kids attending private schools&hellip;did you know that one of the complaints about Catholic and other Christian schools is they don&rsquo;t act Christian?  These religious schools are bringing in more white students then ever before, and a portion of them aren&rsquo;t Christian.  A lot of schools are &#8220;toning down&#8221; to accommodate them.  That&rsquo;s a different issue than the one in this article, but its source is the influx of white students escaping integrated public schools.</p>
<p>Parents used to send their kids to private schools either to get a top notch education or to receive a specific, religious education.  Now we have atheists sending their children to Catholic school just so they can escape the Africans and mestizos in the public setting.  And people praise diversity so fervently&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;that our nation has [not yet] realized Dr. King&rsquo;s dream and created a society where race no longer matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even after the evidence of almost 50 years, Civil Rights Project gerbels Gary Orfield, Erica Frankenberg, and Laurie Russman keep spinning inside their little doctrinaire mind wheels believing there is sinister outside social villany at work preventing complete school integration - when what causes it to be rejected by parents and whole communities is their real knowledge of the disasterous results of school integration. </p>
<p>Parents saw the poor, often vile quality of experience inflicted on their children while in integrated schools, and [those who could] quite responsibly moved their kids to a decent learning environment. </p>
<p>That is the &#8216;villanous instinct&rsquo; the insufferably self-righteous Civil Rights Project types wish to crush - via government force.   </p>

		<p>Mike at 12:27 is right, many Catholic schools are getting lots of non-Catholics these days, and we all know why.  I have a couple students that I&rsquo;ve begun to talk to about racial issues.  My starting point was the fact that their school has all these kids with liberal parents who talk diversity but won&rsquo;t live it.  They saw the contradiction right away.  It was as if I&rsquo;d answered a question they&rsquo;d been afraid to ask. </p>

<p>During the Vietnam War, there were Vietnamese people who were referred to as &#8220;rice Christians&#8221; (according to one person quoted in <i>Everything We Had</i>, by Al Santoli.) That is, if you&rsquo;ve got the rice, I&rsquo;ll pretend to be a Christian to get some of it.</p>
<p>The Catholic high school in my city must be doing this in reverse. If you&rsquo;ve got the &#8220;rice&#8221; (money), we&rsquo;ll let you be Christian. They&rsquo;ve got every race, religion, and sexual persuasion going there. This particular school also has a cadre of hard-left indoctrinators/instructors, one of which I helped to get fired when she stood up in her own class (in a Catholic high school, remember) and said that the &#8220;church is a whore.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Those &#8220;white devels&#8221; wanting their own schools, free from escalating racial violence and reverse discrimination. How dare they.  Even Malcom X had enough sense to realize that the only way to solve the race problem was the complete separation of the black race from the white.  Not one thing has changed.</p>
