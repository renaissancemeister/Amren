			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Hickley, Daily Mail (London), January 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As many as nine out of ten failed asylum seekers are being allowed to stay in Britain despite having no right to remain, a report from a Government watchdog reveals today.</p>
<p>The backlog of illegal immigrants awaiting deportation is growing fast as the UK Border Agency fails to keep pace with the number of rejected applicants. The number of unprocessed cases is also growing.</p>
<p>And Government rules stating that all successful asylum seekers must have their cases reviewed after five years  &mdash;  to see if their country is now safe enough to return to  &mdash;  have descended into farce, because the Border Agency has no way of tracking those living in Britain and no plans for a review.</p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling called the report, from the National Audit Office, a &#8216;shocking indictment of the shambles that is our immigration and asylum system&rsquo;. Meanwhile, the Commons Public Accounts Committee, to which the NAO reports, claimed the Agency was &#8216;struggling to cope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last year, the Home Office introduced the &#8216;New Asylum Model&rsquo; in a bid to streamline Britain&rsquo;s chaotic asylum system, by assigning each case to a single civil servant from start to finish.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report acknowledges that the Â£800million-a-year system is now &#8216;better organised than before&rsquo;, but highlights grave problems which in many cases are getting worse.</p>
<p>A surge in the number of asylum claims saw the backlog of undecided cases more than double in a year, to almost 9,000.</p>
<p>The NAO tracked more than 25,000 claims lodged from January 2007 to February 2008, of which almost 14,000 were refused.</p>
<p>But of 10,719 cases processed in the seven regions around the UK, only 918  &mdash;  less than 10 per cent  &mdash;  had actually been deported by the following August.</p>
<p>The rate was higher for 3,000 false claimants who were fast-tracked in detention. Including these claims, the overall removal rate was just one in four.</p>
<p>A severe shortage of detention spaces is making removals harder, the report warned, with much of the available capacity taken up by foreign criminals who have completed their sentences and are awaiting deportation.</p>
<p>The NAO also highlighted glaring inefficiencies, including:</p>
<p>o Seventy per cent of planned deportations  &mdash;  where security staff accompany deportees on flights home  &mdash;  are cancelled, often due to lack of proper coordination, leading to &#8216;additional work and costs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>o The Agency often has to buy emergency travel documents from foreign governments to deport failed asylum seekers, but 13,000 of these have been wasted because individuals absconded, or because the papers expired.</p>
<p>o Since 2005, Britain has granted asylum for five years only  &mdash;  after which cases should be reviewed in the hope that some immigrants will be able to return home.</p>
<p>But astonishingly the Border Agency &#8216;has no process&rsquo; to track refugees living in Britain and &#8216;no plans in place to review these cases&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are 8,000 due for review next year.</p>
<p>Last night, the Agency&rsquo;s chief executive Lin Homer confirmed there was &#8216;no requirement&rsquo; for asylum seekers to tell officials when they move house.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said: &#8216;This is a shameful performance for the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds. It is no surprise that asylum seekers, many of them bogus, are queuing up in Calais.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s just as well that Hitler didn&rsquo;t decide to invade Britain in 2009. Victory could have been his within two days with aid of a pedalo, a couple of kayaks, and a false moustache.<br>
The terms seive and leak come to mind.<br>
Seriously though (and this situation is deadly serious), no one has the political will to remedy the situation.<br>
Knife, gun, drug, rape crime are increasing exponentially and all the Labour government has to offer is liberal paralysis. </p>

			<p>Great Britain is rapidly being transformed into a brownish-black country; the only upside if that many White Britons are getting tired of it, and are starting to stand up and support the Parties (such as the British National Party) who will  keep their country theirs. </p>

<p>Yes, I have thought of that myself. Especially when I see the video tapes of African immigrants in the UK happy-slapping British Whites on buses, and anywhere in public, then laughingly capturing it on their cell phones. And a good reason this sick trend never took off in the US, is because people remember how Bernard Goetz reacted when black thugs decided to single him out for abuse.</p>

<p>The British never had a any guns to relinquish. We have never been in a position of fighting indigenous Injuns whilst planting chickens, as you have over the other side of the pond.<br>
We have owned guns during wartime, it is true. However, when the wars have ended, back into storage they go for the next time America decides that things are getting a bit too rowdy around the chuck wagon. Why don&rsquo;t you take all that bile, spittle and anomosity towards Britons and shoot a few possums to burn off the Elvisburger calories and testosterone. Failing that, buy a banjo and find a muse. How&rsquo;s that for national sterotyping?&hellip;or should we use the misnomer, RACISM?<br>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know your own history.   As my British grandmother would point out to you, England&rsquo;s 1688 Bill of Rights gave citizens the unambiguous right to own private firearms, and unlike here in the U.S.A., such ownership rights were not tied into the issue of State Militias.  Restrictions on gun ownership rights in England began to be curtailed only after WWI, and then even more so after WWII, with barely a bahhh from the British citizens.</p>
<p>Prior to WWI, English citizens had as equally-free rights to gun ownership as Americans did.  Yes, after the wars your guns went &#8216;back in storage&rsquo;, but that&rsquo;s because of, i assume, the then new post-war laws enacted to systematically take away all your gun rights over time, which they have now successfully done.</p>
<p>If the battle-hardened British soldiers returning from WWI or WWII had taken to the streets en-masse when the government tried to pass the new restrictions on gun ownership, you wouldn&rsquo;t be having this discussion today.  </p>
<p>In England, over 50% of the home burglaries happen when the occupants are at home.  In America, it&rsquo;s only 10% thanks to gun ownership rights.  Today, if a British &#8216;subject&rsquo; shoots an intruder during a robbery in their own home, they can go to jail for murder, and if the intruder survives, he can turn around and sue the homeowner for damages, possibly taking their home in the process.</p>
<p>You let this Orwellian nightmare police state happen to yourselves, while we Americans were out &#8216;shooting chickens and possums and eating our elvis burgers,&rsquo; as you put it.  But you won&rsquo;t be seeing Americans lining up quietly and obediently handing in their guns to the police just because we were told to do so like the British did recently.</p>
<p>At that point, Americans will stop shooting just chickens and possums and turn their gun sights on anyone who dares to infringe on our Constitutional Rights, which we got, by the way, over 100 years after you did in 1688.  </p>
<p>And no, I don&rsquo;t feel any &#8216;animosity&rsquo; toward the British, my ancestors.  I feel sad that they, unlike many Americans, such as the readers of AmRen, do not believe the expression, &#8220;Hello, I&rsquo;m here from the government, and I&rsquo;m here to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p> What you say about gunownership in the British isles is just not so. Gunownership was quite common until after WW1. This was especially true in Ulster. I suggest you do a little historical research. The truth is that the British people HAD guns and let their government disarm them. Again do some historical research. I was very surprised to learn just how widespread firearms were in Britain at one time.</p>

			<p>Graham of Wales, why are you being so insulting to Americans with your litany of stereotypes?  Because someone on this site called the British &#8220;sheep&#8221;?  In large part the British masses are sheep, but so too are many Americans!  Please don&rsquo;t insult us.  We at AmRen are your friends across the ocean; we follow articles like this because we care about your beautiful country.  </p>
<p>Britain belongs first and foremost to the native Anglo-Saxon-Celtic British and that shouldn&rsquo;t even be a matter for debate.</p>

<p>Yes, we were given the right to own firearms. However, whether we could afford to buy and own a firearm is another matter. Here in Britain we have, for many centuries, not been able to go out and shoot a buffalo or something else wooly when our tummies started rumbling. <br>
America is, after all, a very new country built upon the premise that if you don&rsquo;t own a gun your dead. Here in Britain we have never had to form the wagons into a circle - holiday caravans, yes; wagons, no. In fact, if the truth be known, the reason why America was able to be stolen from the American Indian was due to the fact that all the Indians had in the beginning was a quiver full of arrows.<br>
With your regard your comment on the failure of Britain&rsquo;s returning troops to hang on to their guns on return from WW1 and WW2 - not very many did return from the carnage. Those that did return were shell-shocked, traumatized and broken. I know this because many of the fit young men in my Welsh home town died in the trenches still clutching the bloody stock of a gun. <br>
Back to the present, As an American feel free to point your gun at anyone who infringes on your Constitional Rights.<br>
However, ensure that the burglar who is rattling around in your kitchen in the early hours is not in fact your son rummaging around for a bowl of cornflakes, or a neighbour who has come to tell you that you have left your car lights on.<br>
If you carry a gun, or a knife for that matter, you must be sure that you intend to use it if necessary. Most people have not got the stomach for the explosion and possibly fatal outcome.<br>
In the end I believe that we both singing from the same hymn sheet. However, here in Britain and due to its size, political subdugation and control is so much easier than in the USA. We are a very densely populated country (and even more so due to recent and uncontrolled immigration). I truly feel that the Britons (note, I do not use the term, &#8216;British&rsquo; as this doesn&rsquo;t mean anything any more) have lost their identity, their culture and their spirit. If we were all issued with Thompson machine guns we couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to use then for fear of causing offence. Britain as a Western culture is finished and a sacrifice to &#8216;globalism&rsquo;. Amen.<br>
PS: I&rsquo;m quite partial to the occasional Elvisburger.</p>

<p>Like 5:07, I am surprised anyone claiming to be Welsh, or(British) would know so little about their own history. Because while Brits might not have ever been known for possum hunting, up until recent years, they were quite famous for their fox hunting, and it was entirely legal to do so, and to own guns for it. You might even want to have a look at this video, of British citizens in Scotland, demonstrating over the loss of their rights to own hunting guns. Most of them were not complaining, because they so dearly love shooting foxes, so much as they were complaining about their liberties being taken away from them, and also the ablity to defend themselves against home intrusions. Of course, with the way the Britain has become of late, most of you in the UK never had the opportunity to see this demonstration on the news there, because it has been banned. <br>

			<p>To Graham of Wales:<br>
The British government has confiscated millions of privately owned guns, and not just from the aristocracy who could afford them for fox hunting.  No doubt that most households in the UK outside of the major cities, had at least one firearm, probably passed down through the generations.  It would shock me if someone in your own family, at one time, didn&rsquo;t own a gun.</p>
<p>In the U.S.A. every year, over a million legal gun owners have twarted criminals by using their legally-owned weapons, many of whom had to only brandish them, not discharge them.   Ten times as many criminals are shot by law abiding citizens than are shot by our own police.  200,000 women a year avoid rape and sexual assault by carrying a &#8216;saturday night special&rsquo; in their purse.</p>
<p>And less than 2% of those episodes where citizens have had to use their guns have resulted in a mistaken identity, that you seem to worry about.  Compare that to the police  &mdash;  who shoot almost 6 times as many suspects mistakenly.</p>
<p>Yes, many of the British war veterans returned &#8216;shellshocked&rsquo;, as you stated, but that&rsquo;s a rather weak excuse to hand over your guns.  There are millions of war veterans in this country who have experienced the same trauma, but they are the last people I&rsquo;d want to try and take their guns away from.  In fact, the U.S. government is trying to pass new gun regulations so that any veteran who has sought psychological help for their war trauma cannot ever own a weapon.  That tells you how low these gun grabbers will go.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some advice from a possum and buffalo shootin&rsquo; American  &mdash;  start a peaceful mass demonstration with 10,000 or more citizens who are willing to surround Parliament and refuse to leave until they give you back your rights to own your own guns.  What are they going to do?  Arrest 10,000 people?  Remember, you have a lot of policemen on the force that would be sympathetic to your cause.</p>
<p>If someone calls your people &#8216;sheep&rsquo;, you don&rsquo;t sit around and whine, complain, and come up with clever excuses.  You do something to prove them wrong.  If you&rsquo;re willing to go to jail over a pub brawl, you should also be willing to go to jail for demanding your right to own a gun.  The British have a long history of military bravery, sometimes against all odds, like the first Zulu war.  Tap into that spirit.  It&rsquo;s still within your people, I know, because America arose from your blood and tenacity.</p>
<p>All it takes, Graham, is one man who is willing to stick his neck out and start organizing.  With all your passion, you sound like you might very well be that man who could make a difference.</p>

			<p>Graham of Wales:</p>
<p> Recall incidents like the two Jacobite rebellions. Those clansmen all had firearms. What about the legendary highway robberymen of British lore? They all had guns. How about noblemen fighting duels? They didn&rsquo;t use harsh language. I read once in a British history book of an event early in the 20th century. A bunch of foreigners had robbed a bank and had guns. The British police did not. They called out to the crowd if they could borrow a gun from someone. Dozens of men produced firearms for the police. The idea that Britain has always been a gun-free place is as much of a myth as the claim it has always been multiracial and multicultural. </p>

&#8220;America is, after all, a very new country built upon the premise that if you don&rsquo;t own a gun your dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the premise that if you don&rsquo;t own a gun, you&rsquo;re dead. We do believe that law abiding citizens, if they so choose, have a right to own a gun and to use it to protect their homes, families, selves however. I personally don&rsquo;t own a gun. However, in a way, I can see where gun ownership would not have been an issue in England in the past,unlike the USA. The USA has always been big and vast and many people lived(still do)  in deserted areas far from towns or the police and needed guns in isolated areas, just in case. Thus gun ownership was necessary and needed. Britan, on the other hand, after the WW2 era was/is very compact and crime was extremely low so gun ownership was not something Brits thought about or needed. As such, when the government banned guns, most Brits didn&rsquo;t care because they simply weren&rsquo;t needed. Now with all the immigration and rising crimes rates, things have changed.</p>
<p> &#8220;In fact, if the truth be known, the reason why America was able to be stolen from the American Indian was due to the fact that all the Indians had in the beginning was a quiver full of arrows.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is now the US/Canada was 99% unsettled and uninhabited when europeans first started coming. Indians only made up about 1% of the land and these were different nomadic tribes who fought each other, had no concept of land ownership and there was no country. Later the indians were treated poorly in the US and Canada and that  was wrong, I don&rsquo;t argue that, but America as a whole wasn&rsquo;t stolen, even though that is a common belief here and elsewhere. If europeans had not moved here, somebody else would have, as you had a huge amount of land that was empty.</p>
