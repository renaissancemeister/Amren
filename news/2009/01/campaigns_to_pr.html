<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There is no justification for conservationists to defend particular species because of their &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;, Professor Christopher Smout writes in a new book, Exploring Environmental History.</p>
<p>Campaigns against &#8220;alien invaders&#8221;  &mdash;  such as the cull of American ruddy ducks to prevent them from breeding with European duck species  &mdash;  have no basis in science, he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conservationists are up in arms because they fear the ducks will all get turned into some kind of mishmash,&#8221; he told The Independent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conservationists would say: &#8216;We&rsquo;re doing this because it&rsquo;s endangering the genetic integrity of the white-headed duck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a scientifically valid point of view. The concern with genetic integrity seems almost quasi-racist. Our attitude to alien species is culturally determined and sometimes you end up with rather bizarre actions by scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof Smout, who is Scotland&rsquo;s Historiographer Royal and founder of the Institute for Environmental History at St Andrews University, said that conservationists should judge species based on whether or not they are pests, and ignore their origins.</p>
<p>He added that interbreeding between species could often bring evolutionary benefits, and dismissed fears that the genetic identity of red deer in Scotland is threatened by silka deer, which were brought to the UK from Asia in 1860.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds described the &#8220;quasi-racism&#8221; charge as outrageous, and said that conservationists &#8220;give their lives to give beleaguered native fauna a chance&#8221;.<br>

<p>Perhaps Professor Smout can provide a believable and acceptable explanation as to why the white gene is the most regressive gene, and when whites cross racial lines to breed - the little crumb cruncher who pops out, nearly ALWAYS resembles the minority  non-white parent MORE than the white race traitorous idiot parent?</p>
<p>And, after this anti-white, hate filled, white racial genocide promoting weasel finishes with that topic - maybe he can then explain how whites should not be worried about being mongrelized into extinction as a result their swallowing lies like Smout promotes?</p>
<p>You know something, fellow AR readers?  I am having a serious bout of conspiratorial suspicions about this Professor Smout&rsquo;s intentions regarding this subject.    I think Mr. Smout has an agenda, and that agenda is to exterminate white people visi vi miscegenation.</p>
<p>Does anyone else see through this sinister propaganda?</p>

<p>You got it all wrong,Charlie.  What has no basis in science is your leftist ideology that is based on a pack of lies and adapted only by those who are mentally disabled.</p>
<p>He should be roundly ridiculed and laughed at for his unnatural concentration on his desire to throw everything into a hopper and see what comes out.  Nature has a specific purpose for making various species, and this little tin god wants to formulate his own brand of natural law, because it makes him feel all warm and fuzzy, which, of course, is the latter stage of total decadence.</p>

They abandoned selective breeding of cattle claiming it was racist. I guess with proper education dairy cattle could be just as good as beef cattle.</p>

			<p>A complete crackpot consumed with a mad ideology.Invasive species are a threat because  they extirpate the native species which exist no where else on the planet out of an ecosystem. And once these species are gone, they are gone forever. More books on the shelves in the library are permanently lost. </p>
<p>The snake-head fish-released into the Potomac by a Chinese LEGAL IMMIGRANT-is a plague upon the Potomac. Over time it will reduce the Potamac to an ecological wasteland. The saner conservation biologists in the US encourage anyone who catches the snakehead fish to kill it immediately. </p>
<p>England is clearly now an insane asylum.</p>

			<p>If a so-called &#8220;native species&#8221; cannot hold off intrusions by non-native species, then it seems fairly clear that the native species probably does not have the best adaptations for the native environment at the present time and the non-native species does.</p>
<p>Nature doesn&rsquo;t play favorites.  It just keeps tinkering with life so that some form of life will fill the particular environmental niche. How best to see which is the best form for the particular environment but to let them compete?</p>

			<p>Mr. Smout isn&rsquo;t much of an environmentalist if he has failed to appreciate the singular fact that the vast majority of these invasive species are the result of human interference / importation.  Environmentalists typically work to reverse such human impact, instead of cheerfully supporting it as a form of diversity.</p>

			<p>Unless Professor Smout is an ardent Scottish Nationalist, I would say that his attitude toward species preservation is more culturally determined than the people at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  I would even say that Professor Smout is willing to accept environmental losses, rather than see a biological point of view that might be analogous to an argument against multiculturalism accepted.  A true fanatic.   </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but why the hell is <i>anyone</i> listening to a what a Professor in <b>Historiography</b> ( <i>Broadly speaking, historiography examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods, drawing upon such elements such as authorship, sourcing, interpretation, style, bias, and audience. </i> ) thinks about which species are &#8220;pests&#8221;, why genepool dilution is good/bad etc?</p>
<p>I wonder if he thinks that maintaning different breeds of dog for different functions is also &#8220;backward&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221;&hellip;</p>

			<p>It was only a matter of time till those intent on a marxist &hellip; genetic re-distribution of wealth (in humans) realized the need to police zoological terminology. Invasive species have long been a problem amongst native plants and animals in North America and biologists/botanists labor profusely to protect native species from being marginalized or wiped out entirely. The obvious paralel between native white populations ( Euro-caucasians) being overcome by darker less advanced but more aggressive races of man is what is hoped to be disguised in  this as a good thing and those averse to this as ignorant or evil. The marxist revolution attempted to level the economic playing field out of jealousy of the accomplished, the new PC globalist MARXISTS seek to accomplish this at a genetic level by BASTARDIZING the Euro-Caucasian out of his IDENTITY&hellip;OH &hellip;look how charming and open minded fair skinned Alison looks with big dark Dwante with his long cornrows&hellip;If there&rsquo;s no more wealthy people no one can be poor &hellip;If there&rsquo;s no more white people around no one can look dusky&hellip;Genetic Marxism,?&hellip;No Thank You.</p>

<p>Such as applying absurd multiculturalist ideology to the field of animal genetics?  Or do you mean something even more bizarre than that, &#8220;Professor&#8221; Smout?</p>

Their politicians browbeat British citizens like children, and lecture them on keeping with their loony leftist multicultural policies. What in the world has happened to that once great nation?

			<p>The &ldquo;quasi-racism&rdquo; charge is a logical consequence of the Liberal ideology, unconditional &#8220;equality&#8221; is one of the basic axioms of. As absurd as it is, it constitutes a prof by contradiction (I hope you remember what reductio ad absurdum is from the high school) that the Liberal ideology is based on false axiom(s).<br>

			<p>&#8220;Isn&rsquo;t interbreeding between species impossible?&#8221;</p>
<p>No.  A &#8220;species&#8221; is an artificial definition, created by we humans in an attempt to describe the world of animals.  Dogs, for example, are genus Canis, and so are wolves, but they have different species definitions (Canis familiaris and Canis lupus, respectively).  Dogs and wolves can of course interbreed, so long as they are approximately the same size.  Roxanne, a &#8220;dog&#8221; some friends had, was Alsatian, Rhodesian Ridgeback and Timber Wolf.  She was a pretty big girl.  Her owners were worried a bit about her when they had a little girl, but Roxie turned out quite the opposite of their worst fears; she was VERY protective of the baby, as she regarded the child as partly hers.  She was also quite nice with certain company, like myself.  She used to receive beef thigh bones from the supermarket, and I would dig the marrow out for her with my pocket knife and put it in her bowl.  When staying at my friend&rsquo;s home, I would always sleep on the floor near the sofa, as sofa sleeping bothers my back, and Roxanne would sleep beside me.  Canis familiaris or Canis lupus?  You decide.</p>
<p>A much simpler version is horses and donkeys.  When last I checked, mules were still possible.  </p>
<p>Our description of an animal does not actually determine what it is, any more than our Newtonian version of physics determines the way a universe that operates under Einsteinian relativity or quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>As Newtonian physics is an approximation, our definition of a &#8220;species&#8221; is an approximation; that&rsquo;s all.</p>

			<p>This is a broadside from the leftist fanatics that control the establishment.  Many of us have been pointing out for years that sanctifying the saving of the Spotted Owl, but demonizing the saving of the white man, is hypocrisy at its zenith.</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;re making a move toward consistency, and (shock!) throwing the Spotted Owl under the bus in order to justify keeping the white man under the wheels.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised they put in the effort to think it through that far.</p>

			<p>Life in Britain today</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s racist for a white family to have a black ragdoll in their window. And can cause British council to come knocking at your door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s racist and insensitive of ethnic minorities to hang the Union Jack flag outside your home. Which can send British council knocking.</p>
<p>It is also racist and insensitive to sing patriotic hymns in the classroom, so they have been banned.</p>
<p>Home Office Minister is chastised for using the politically incorrect term nitty gritty, which is connected to slavery.</p>
<p>The term Englishman banned from songs and books, because the term isn&rsquo;t inclusive of minorities. </p>
<p>Now preserving a native species of duck is racist, because heaven forbid, indigenous white Brits might feel the same way about their own people.</p>
<p>Is there any doubt that the UK has gone mad? The PC police are there at every turn issuing warnings and citations. To me the UK now represents Hell on earth.</p>

If by now they do not see the writing on the wall, and how far out of hand things are going there, then they have truly been brainwashed beyond hope. Already, I have begun to lose faith in them. Why is it we never hear of anyone protesting the level of  madness that is going on there today?</p>
