<h1>California Taxpayer Protection Act</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Introduction to the California Taxpayer Protection Act </p>
<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>I want to call your attention to a statewide initiative in California that may change the debate on the automatic citizenship that is wrongly bestowed upon children born to illegal aliens and foreign visitors in the United States. The initiative &mdash; The California Taxpayer Protection Act &mdash; is being planned for the June 2010 California ballot. This may seem like a distant point on the horizon, but it&rsquo;s really not when you consider the herculean efforts necessary to secure a spot on the ballot in the state. Supporters are being sought from across the nation for this important initiative. </p>
<p>Initiative Background </p>
<p>The initiative is sponsored by Taxpayer Revolution and authored by Ted Hilton, a scholar of Constitutional Law and expert on the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s original intent. The measure has three major provisions that would: </p>
<p>• Create a second type of California birth certificate for children born to illegal aliens and others who are not permanent residents. The current certificate would be limited to children with at least one parent who submits an affidavit stating that he or she is a citizen or a permanent legal resident (Social Security Number verified); </p>
<p>• Restrict illegal alien parents from applying for child-only CalWORKS benefits (TANF) for their U.S. born child by requiring lawful presence of all applicants; and </p>
<p>• Limit public benefits by requiring a signed affidavit under penalty of perjury that one is a citizen or qualified alien, and using the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program to verify legal residency. </p>
<p>Birth mothers who are not citizens or legal residents would be required to: apply for a birth certificate in person; provide complete identity including means of support; submit three passport type photographs; and be fingerprinted. All of this information would be provided to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such mothers also would pay an additional $75 fee. </p>
<p>Qualifying the Initiative </p>
<p>To qualify for the ballot, the initiative requires 433,971 signatures. Since a cushion is needed for security, the proponents are seeking a total of 550,000. The last month to begin signature gathering, which must occur over a five-month period, is June 2009. However, experts believe that the best five-month period for gathering signatures is February through June. </p>
<p>Reasons to Support </p>
<p>NumbersUSA has long supported ending the automatic granting of U.S. citizenship to children born here to illegal aliens, finally righting a misguided and unintended interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior to the introduction of this initiative, we have promoted passage of bills in Congress to this end. Those bills have not been successful and are not likely to see action in the 111th Congress. As such, we need to consider an alternative means for moving forward. </p>
<p>Passing an initiative in California requiring the issuance of two types of birth certificates will ignite the national debate needed as a precursor to ending automatic citizenship. Success in California will set the stage for other states to follow and likely prompt litigation that could give the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to rule. The high court has never decided a citizenship case for children of temporary residents or those here illegally. We are confident such a case would finally end this misbegotten policy. </p>
<p>The initiative has already been endorsed by Representatives Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.; Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus Chair) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), Ward Connerly (proponent of English language and other initiatives), Peter Nunez (former Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury), the California American Legion, and others. </p>

			<p>There will first be intimidation during the signature gathering phase.  If they are lucky enough to gather the 550,000 signatures, get it placed on a ballot, and voted into law, it will be challenged in a lower court by the ACLU and overturned in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  It will eventually work its way up to the Supreme Court, where the new liberal majority on the Supreme Court will uphold the 9th Circuit&rsquo;s ruling.</p>

			<p>We must defend our citizenship rights to make this law. It is essential to USA republic to correct long needed infringements upon our taxpayers and future generations.  Those who have come to usurp our way of life by violating our immigration laws can not be rewarded with citizenship for births upon arrival. This must end.  USA has been permanently culturally damaged by the millions of illegal births put upon our citizens to provide for.<br>
In addition, the failure of Federal agencies to protect US from invasion has resulted in the colonization of many Amercican cities.  These cities in USA are now living proof of colonization. Foreign residence come with no intention of becoming Amercians, learning English or keeping the laws.  The results are manifesting in all kinds of fraud, CA going BK because it will not admit to the consequences of subidizing millions over decades.  Third generations of immigrants on gov assistance are filling the hospital nurseries,ER&rsquo;s, prisons, and government offices.   Please support this effort.  V</p>

			<p>What &#8216;Cop&rsquo; says is probably true.  Nonetheless, a big court battle will bring national attention to the fact that simply being born in the US need not entitle one to citizenship.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Tis not enough.  Only children born to U.S. Citizens should be granted instant U.S. citizenship.  Children born to legal residents can only be given legal residency for as long as their parents are legal residents.  If and when their parents become naturalized, they can become naturalized as well&hellip;so long as they are <i>minor</i> children.</p>

			<p>One unintended consequence of such a law is that many legitimate citizens will not be able to provide enough documentation for their children and hence their children will not be considered true citizens.  A better solution would be for governments to cease providing any charity/welfare.  It is not government&rsquo;s job to provide charity.  At the same time, the U.S. should bring home all the troops it has stationed in hundreds of countries and use some of them to guard the borders.  Once this happens there will be far less incentive for illegal immigrants to come here and far less opportunity.</p>

			<p>I am very concerned that we would have many more undocumented births as a result of this law.  I am sure that we already have some people who cannot prove where or when they were born currently living in this country.  People whose parents who are currently recognized as existing here illegally would become people who themselves just legally don&rsquo;t exist.  What happens when this person who legally never lived then dies?  How do we establish who these perhaps suddenly numerous people who never had ID were when faced with the remains?  </p>
<p>As coldblooded as it sounds jewamongyou is probably right. I do sometimes give to charity.  I am less and less willing to do so though because private charities are run more and more like businesses.  They help those they think can pay them back with the only exception being ethnic groups they are afraid of because these groups use charity as another opportunity for extortion.</p>
<p>I have had to ask for help, but I didn&rsquo;t go to the government.  I went to a couple of organizations that I had donated to in the past seeking help until I could get in touch with my family after I got trapped following a storm.  I got a very cold reception and was long afterwards treated like I owed them money because they had let me use their telephone to make a collect call to my father.       </p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they get their 550,000 signatures by June and if ultimately allowed on the ballot, it&rsquo;ll pass handily. But victory may be short lived. Anyone with reasonable memory knows what happened with the bollot measure known as Proposition 197 in 1994. Here&rsquo;s a brief recap of what happened. Prop. 187 got enough signatures to be put on the November 1994 ballot, it passed with 59% of the vote on election day, despite a barrage of negative publicity from the &#8220;mainsteam&#8221; media. La Raza, MALDEF and the ACLU then sued to prevent its enforcement and they got their wish. It got bogged down in the courts until the now recalled ex gov. Gray Davis was elected in &#8216;98. <br>
Then he had it killed behind the scenes in &#8216;mediation&rsquo; with the encouragement of the mexican gov&rsquo;t. If we are to ultimately prevail this time, similiar referendums need to be held in states across the nation, not just in CA because it&rsquo;ll be a case of deja vu all over.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As coldblooded as it sounds jewamongyou is probably right. I do sometimes give to charity. I am less and less willing to do so though because private charities are run more and more like businesses. &#8220;</p>
<p>By law, charities and non profits are allowed to spend 89 percent of their income on administrative costs which are mainly salaries.  Thus, nearly all charities spend only 11 percent of their funds on the objects of their charity.</p>
<p>100 years ago an ambitious young person who couldn&rsquo;t get a good job started a business. Nowadays an ambitious young person who can&rsquo;t get a job finds a cause, starts a non profit to help underprivileged victims and makes $100,000 per year as executive director of the charity by the time he or she is 30.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give a dime to charities.  89 percent of the money goes to their salaries.  Most use professional fundraisers who work on commission and take a big percentage of the money raised as their fee.</p>
