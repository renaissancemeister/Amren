<h1><a href="http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/Local/article/165270">African-Canadian Community Grapples With AIDS &#8216;Stigma&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Metro News (Halifax), January 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AIDS remains a disproportionate threat to Nova Scotia&rsquo;s African-Canadian community and the recent &#8220;criminalization&#8221; of the disease has made matters worse, experts say.</p>
<p>Larry Baxter is chairman of the Nova Scotia Advisory Commission on AIDS. He has said the province&rsquo;s strategy on HIV-AIDS, announced in 2003, lacked input from black communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think much has changed,&#8221; he said yesterday. &#8220;There are still issues of stigma, lack of information and lack of discussion within the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two cases in Ontario where HIV-positive men were charged after having sex with women and not disclosing their status may discourage some men from getting tested, Baxter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s the thinking that if you don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t be held criminally liable,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>David Divine, the James R. Johnston Chair in Black Canadian Studies at Dalhousie University, said the bigger problem is funding and attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of a general movement of interest and information gathering, that most definitely has increased (since 2003),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have significant sums of money available to an agency, but if the right people are not in that agency with the right attitudes &hellip; you&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Divine said it&rsquo;s difficult for a black person to go for an AIDS test. &#8220;They are continuously afraid of being discriminated against not only because of their colour, but because the very possibility of having HIV-AIDS carries such a profound stigma.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Health Association of African Canadians is making dealing with AIDS one of its focuses for African Heritage Month in February. President Phyllis Marsh-Jarvis said fear, religious beliefs and stigma play a key role in discouraging people in her community from discussing AIDS.<br/>

		<p>Among healthy Whites, being Black carries a stigma, having AIDS carries a stigma, and  having sex with Blacks carries a stigma.   A stigma is society&rsquo;s warning to its less informed members that some things are best avoided.  Would Larry Baxter, David Devine, and Phyllis Marsh-Jarvis recommend that warning signs be removed from the highways too?</p>

<p>Funny&hellip;Because those are some of the same reasons why people in our community don&rsquo;t discuss the ravages of racial diversity. &hellip;Or the simple fact that we don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;moral duty&#8221; to wipe ourselves off the face of the earth.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t blame Africans for being Africans. You can blame marxist Canadians for allowing their country to be settled by third world migrants, and kowtowing to their every whim.</p>

		<p>Criminalizing the deliberate passing of HIV did not give African-Canadians the virus. No doubt there were some new cases that were prevented by punishing the deliberate act of infecting a healthy person.</p>
<p>Remember, a common myth in Africa is that HIV/AIDS can be cured by having sex with a virgin. (The only virgins are young children.) As long as they believe this, they will continue to propagate the virus to uninfected populations, whether they are tested or not. Testing only makes it possible to prosecute them for DELIBERATELY spreading HIV.<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting the Canadian government helps spread this disease among whites by refusing to warn them of the high incidences of aids among blacks, especially from Africa.</p>
<p>Canada has imported its own brand of chaos in encouraging third world immigration, and like theUS and the rest of the West are in the process of reaping what they have stupidly sown.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the multicults there feel quite satisfied and smug in their promotion of crime and poverty importations, and believe they are making a better world.</p>
<p>It is those types that deserve to be tried and convicted for crimes against their own people, because surely the Canadians will also see much chaos and calamities in this coming super storm wrought by the economic whirlwind now blasting its way around the world.</p>
<p>In ten years I wonder if they&rsquo;ll look back and decide that aids infected blacks represented their less damaging screw ups.</p>

<p>What was conveniently omitted, was the fact that these two HIV-positive men were two separate <b>African refugees</b>. One story can be read <a href="http://canadianimmigrationreform.blogspot.com/2008/08/another-hiv-infected-african-immigrant.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>HIV cases are on the rise only because Canadians foolishly leave the door wide open to allow even more disease-carrying &#8220;refugees&#8221; into the country as elaborated in plain English in <a href="http://canadianimmigrationreform.blogspot.com/2008/07/putting-health-of-canadians-at-risk.html" rel="nofollow">this other post</a>.</p>

<p>In other words they are afraid that if their HIV status becomes known it will reduce their opportunities for hooking up. </p>
<p>Essentially that it is better to infect innocent  &mdash;  albeit naive/dim witted  &mdash;  people with terrible terminal illness that to impede a brotha in his fundamental right to unlimited booty calls.</p>

		<p>In Europe it is definitely a crime to have sex and deliberately infect a healthy &#8220;partner&#8221; so to not discreetly publicise those who are HIV positive could be construed as being accessory to a crime so it could be argued that any authority preventing the registation of those who have a communicable dangerous disease such as leprosy, HIV, the new strain especially of XB TB, and so on, shuld be sued in the Courts there as a test case.  Concerned Canadians must write to their representatives in govt demanding the law that all must be tested.   I have an annual medical (I am 71) where a blood test is done and it is good to know that all is well- so far.   It is a human rights violation surely to let such diseased people wilingly infect others?   I have been with my 2nd wife now for 24 years and would never touch another woman but then I have no need to.  She is 20 years younger.</p>

<p><br/>
What&rsquo;s lacking in their community is not information and discussion, but intelligence and self-restraint. </p>
<p>Also, AmRen readers may find that the name David Divine sounds familiar. Click on the Canadian flag or the words &#8220;Banned in Halifax&#8221; up the right-hand column of this page and read how the cowardice, duplicity and intellectual dishonesty of this &#8220;Chair in Black Canadian Studies at Dalhousie University&#8221; caused major headaches for AmRen&rsquo;s very own Jared Taylor a while back. Not that Canada really NEEDS a &#8220;Chair in Black Canadian Studies&#8221;   &mdash;   or ANY &#8220;Black Canadian Studies&#8221; at ANY university   &mdash;   but this Divine is particularly reprehensible: his devotion to messing things up for white people goes well beyond the call the duty. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s analyise precisely how this situation came to exist at all.</p>
<p>1.   The invention of Political Correctness to suppress the nature of the threat, ie, Third World races and cultures along with their disproportinate propensities towards crime such as rape/gang rape, compared with criminal tendancies in white races.  (Crime statistics across the world point to whites constituting the highest ratio of victims of non-white criminals).</p>
<p>2.  United Nations dictat.  ( The UN is usually comprised of over twice the number of non-white Third World member states than white ones)  This figure periodically fluctuates slightly, but always leans to the advantage of non-white member state numbers).</p>
<p>3.  Open border policies specifically directed at white living spaces in Canada AND throughout the world.</p>
<p>4.  The gradual replacement of white staff with Third World and/or Third World originating non-white staff in key immigration/asylum posts, in white countries.</p>
<p>5.  Ongoing Third World immigration and asylum <b>most especially</b> unfettered mass immigration/asylum, overwhelmingly illegal.</p>
<p>6.  Deliberate loss of control of borders to permanently facilitate illegal entry.</p>
<p>7.  Planned collapse of compulsory interception and tracking programmes of both <i>legals</i> and illegals in the detection of those of them carrying highly infectious and killer diseases.</p>
<p>We already know the collective identities of the New World Order architects and engineers behind this planned genocide of both white Europeans and white others of European extraction domicile outside Europe, and its contiguous ancestral white homelands.</p>
<p>The question is,</p>
<p>for how much longer are the forces behind the New World Order going to be allowed to get away with their agenda before they&rsquo;re stopped - for good?<br/>

		<p>The scam I sometimes encounter is someone from Florida telling me I won a huge prize.  They are ready to ship it to me if I would give them my credit card.  Needless to say I hang up.</p>
<p>Another time I got a call from a man claiming to be a hollywood producer that has a major film in the works, but due to production overrun costs they need to raise a little cash.  He asked me for $20,000.  I hung up.</p>

		<p>There have been many cases of people charged with having AIDS or HIV and knowingly infecting others here in Canada in the past several years. With just one single exception (the guy was an Inuit, used to call them Eskimos in pre-P.C. times, from WAY UP NORTH) every one of the accused was black. </p>

		<p>Well, &#8220;criminalizing AIDS&#8221; is &#8220;racism,&#8221; obviously.  First look up the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; rule.  Then look up the numbers on who has AIDS (and other STDs).  Then ponder whether &#8220;criminalizing AIDS&#8221; passes the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; rule.</p>
<p>See?  &#8220;Racism!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The high incidence of HIV infection among Black males means that rape especially horrendous, Esp for white women victims since they rape so many of them:</p>
<p><b>&#8220;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.</b></p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=F3E3CD97-197F-4D31-BF36-A4CBA45FCB13 </p>
<p>The MSM won&rsquo;t discuss this but this means lot of white women have been put under a horrible death sentence through black rape. </p>

		<p>1. Sexual partners should assume one of them could be infected and wear condom unless proven otherwise.  <br/>
2. Failure to voluntarily be tested could be interpreted as negligence, and hence liable for damages.  We hold people liable for damages if they don&rsquo;t clean their sidewalk and someone gets hurt.  Why not other voluntary behaviors as well?<br/>
3. Darwinism suggests self-destructive behavior will result in a decline in population if left alone.</p>

		<p>About a hundred years ago, &#8220;Typhoid Mary&#8221; was imprisoned.  Mary was a cook who  never got sick herself, but carried the disease and spread it to others, some of whom died.  She was forbidden to work in a kitchen by the courts but did so anyway, and was put away for years.    <br/>
     The refusal of the American government to see AIDS as a public health issue, instead of a civil rights issue, ensured its spread.  Any legitimate government that arises from the ashes of the post-Obama era will not allow carriers of lethal diseases to roam so freely.</p>
