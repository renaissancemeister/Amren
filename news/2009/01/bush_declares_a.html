			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Thompson, Daily Mail (London), January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration is set to cost more than £100m making it the most expensive swearing-in ceremony in US history.</p>
<p>The President-elect will take less than a minute to recite the oath of office in front of an estimated two million people in the US capital next week.</p>
<p>But by the time the final dance has been held at one of the many inaugural balls the costs for the day will be a staggering £110m.</p>
<p>The cost was revealed as Mr Obama scrambled to answer questions about the nomination of Treasury Secretary pick Timothy Geithner.</p>
<p>Geithner  &mdash;  the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank whose selection by Obama as Treasury chief in November  &mdash;  is facing questions about an &#8216;illegal&rsquo; housekeeper whose work papers lapsed while she was employed by his family, and about several years when Geithner did not pay £35,000 of Social Security and Medicare taxes for himself.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said in a statement that Geithner had committed honest mistakes that he quickly addressed upon learning of them.</p>
<p>&#8216;He made a common mistake on his taxes, and was unaware that his part-time housekeeper&rsquo;s work authorization expired for the last three months of her employment.</p>
<p>&#8216;We hope that the Senate will confirm him with strong bipartisan support so that he can begin the important work of the country,&rsquo; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>As the Obama team went into damage control over Geither, President Bush declared a state of emergency in Washington  &mdash;  because so many people were expected to attend the inauguration.</p>
<p>In doing so he paved the way for unlimited funding to be released to those local authorities responsible for staging the event.</p>
<p>A president mostly uses the power to declare a state of emergency during a crisis, such as a hurricane or other natural disaster.</p>
<p>The bulk of the cost for the event will be on security with more than 10,000 police and troops forming a ring of steel around Washington DC.</p>
<p>Obama has managed to raise £30m towards the cost of the event with a host of Hollywood stars, including Sharon Stone and Halle Berry, contributing the maximum amount of £33,000.</p>
<p>His money will fund many of the extravagant balls and also for giant TV screens to be placed along The Mall to allow visitors to witness the historic moment when America swears in its first black president.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Obama said they wanted as many people as possible to be able to witness the event.</p>
<p>But it will be the US taxpayer who picks up the main part of the bill to cover security and transport costs.</p>
<p>Officials in Washington DC and neighbouring states have sent a request to Congress for £50m to cover a variety of inaugural costs.</p>
<p>Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty revealed that is amount that will be billed in the days after the January 20th event. US authorities had previously budgeted just £10m for the day based on previous inaugurations for George Bush and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>A White House spokesman said President Bush had willingly approved the extra money.</p>
<p>He said President Bush &#8216;declared an emergency exists in the District of Columbia&rsquo; linked to the inauguration.</p>
<p>It said the city would get federal money for protective measures &#8216;undertaken to save lives and protect public health and safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At least two million people are expected at the swearing-in and parade next Tuesday when Obama will be seen in his new official limousine, dubbed the &#8216;Obamamobile&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Officials estimate 10,000 charters buses will arrive in Washington with roughly 500,000 passengers.</p>
<p>All bridges leading into Washington are being closed and cars banned from a two mile area where Obama will stand on the steps of the US Capitol building to take the oath of office.</p>
<p>Visitors have been told to use public transport and be in their place at least three hours before the service begins.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence services said such a high profile event would be perfect for a terrorist attack, but they have no specific intelligence that anything has been planned.</p>
<p>Obama will use the same Bible used by Abraham Lincoln during the swearing in ceremony.<br>

<p>Are they serious? I predict there will be no terrorist attacks while Obama is in office because the Islamics rightly see Obama as &#8220;one of them.&#8221; Why should they attack when their major aims are now being met? America has kowtowed to multiculturalism and surrendered to the diversicrats, just 8 years after the horror of 9/11. After all, we&rsquo;re electing a president with three Islamic names and turning our country over to outsiders. The total surrender of the United States  &mdash;  what more could any terrorist want?</p>

		<p>At over $200 million, the Obama coronation party will be more expensive by far than either of Bush 43&rsquo;s inaugurations.  Though it&rsquo;s not the <i>cost</i> of inaugurating him that&rsquo;s an emergency in my mind, it&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;re inaugurating him at all.  Bush is Romulus Augustus, Obama is our Odoacer.</p>

		<p>I saw a news report last night describing Obamas speech as being the most significant inauguration speech in the history of the presidency and that school kids will be learning this speech in school in hundreds of years time. And they also said he can&rsquo;t fail, as it&rsquo;s a day after MLK day(01/19/09), and just before the 200th anniversary of Lincon&rsquo;s birth (02/12/08) and the reporters were saying &#8216;he&rsquo;ll knock it out of the park&rsquo;, he can&rsquo;t fail, it&rsquo;ll be great. <br>
Comparing Obmams speech to JFK&rsquo;s, FDR&rsquo;s and LBJ&rsquo;s.<br>
Giving big future tense accolades.</p>
<p>Then they segwayed to the skinny white, college age looking kid who was &#8216;writing&rsquo; the speech on his laptop.<br>
Makes you wonder what catch phrase will come out of this speech.<br>
&#8220;Yes we did&#8221; or &#8220;when the times get tough, the tough get going&#8221;(with head shaking and finger wagging) or some other hackneyed, rejigged cliche that will end up on bumper stickers and T-shirts everywhere like &#8220;hope floats&#8221;.<br>
And Hollywood liberals are all clammering to help out &#8216;the most&rsquo; and &#8216;be seen&rsquo; doing so. Makes me wonder how far off the Will Smith film about it all is. <br>
We live in a time when actors think they&rsquo;re politicians,<br>
(a profession that used to be in the same social caste as prostitution in medieval Europe)<br>
And politicians are actors(more so celebrities).</p>
<p>Keep a look out for onions being rubbed in eyes to help the tears<br>
along from all the usual suspects(it&rsquo;s all so sickening it&rsquo;s actually funny).<br>
Make up on, &#8220;check, break a leg Hussian&#8221; </p>
<p>It all feels so contrived.<br>
I bet the ashtrays around Obama are all getting filled quickly these days.</p>

<p>Wow, so the border could have easily been secured all these past 8 years.  &#8220;State of emergency?&#8221;  &#8220;Ring of steel&#8221;?  Obama&rsquo;s inauguration is deserving of this, but our own border is not?</p>

<p>Funny how &#8220;diversity,&#8221; something that is always touted as being the most &#8220;enriching&#8221; commodity on the planet, always winds up costing our country astronomical amounts of money? Considering the all important &#8220;historic moment when America swears in its first black president,&#8221; one would and should expect gold and manna to simply fall from the sky?</p>

<p>Because it is. Almost every single thing in American politics nowadays is contrived. Frankly, I can&rsquo;t understand how younger people, who claim a greater degree of authentic feeling than others in society, can stand it all. There is no authenticity in American Politics, it&rsquo;s all an illusion. Whether is is Bush, either of the Clintons, McCain, Obama, etc. who is talking on the television, it makes me want to do an Elvis on the t.v., so sickeiningly contrived do these peoples words and behavior seem. In case you don&rsquo;t know what he did when he heard bad singing etc.  &mdash;   he blew the screen out with a shootgun.</p>

I imagined that Obama&rsquo;s inspiration for that phrase came from this book.<br>

&#8220;Yes,I can&#8221; is about as inspired as &#8220;change&#8221;!<br>
Or Paris Hilton saying &#8220;that&rsquo;s hot&#8221;.</p>
<p>I caught various celebrities being interviewed after the recent election (thanks to my partners tastes), when asked what they thought Sarah Palin should do now.<br>
Most of them were saying righteously &#8220;give back the clothes Sarah&#8221;, for a $150,000 clothing bill.<br>
$200 million, that would be close to what some of those A-listers make in a year, it&rsquo;s a pity about that $33,000 limit.</p>
<p>Oprah alone earned $275m in 2007-2008 tax year.<br>

And 50 cent made 150m? <br>

<p>Pay close attention to the donors and boycott all you can.  Spread the word.  Do these people/entities contribute to your community?</p>

The births of two American heroes bracketing one of the most disheartening days I will have seen since 9/11.</p>

		<p>The first black president.  This is a lot like a prediction I&rsquo;ve made several times about NASCAR.  The higher-ups want to respond to pressure from our Masters and put blacks into cars.  Unfortunately, NASCAR almost certainly involves a battery of traits similar to those involved in combat piloting.  And anyone who looks will notice that black combat pilots are far more common on teevee than in the real world (and I can only bring one to mind ATM), because black traits and the combat pilot trait battery don&rsquo;t overlap sufficiently; this despite the fact that Uncle Sam would love nothing more than lots of black combat pilots to put in front of reporters.  So, I predicted that NASCAR faced limited choices in pursuing their goals:</p>
<p>1) Put real blacks in the seat and watch them never win.<br>
2) Put fake blacks (e.g., Obama) in the seat and watch them compete, but do so knowing everyone can see the obvious.</p>
<p>Sorta the same thing here with Obama as our first black president.  They needed a black in the seat, but knew the only real way to get that done is with a fake black like Obama.</p>
<p>Of course, liberals are oblivious so they won&rsquo;t get the joke, but at least the rest of us get to point and laugh for at least 4 years.</p>
<p>(Yes, analogy breaks down, because the trait batteries of politicians and blacks are much closer to one another (almost identical, I&rsquo;d say) than the trait batteries of blacks and racers/flyers)</p>

		<p>It is vrey cold here in Washington and will be for the Inauguration.  You&rsquo;re going to have very cold, bored Obamaniacs.  Buildings, especially restaurants and sandwich shops, will do brisk business yet also be refuges for cold people.  5000 port-o-potties will be in place yet who can guess how many will be unusable within hours- remember the toilets at the New Orleans Super Bowl.  Buses by the thousands will be tying up traffic.  Liquor stores, many of which are owned by Indians(I know one) will be open and the Remy Martin and Colt 45 Malt Liquor will be flowing.  The aged subway, already prone to breakdowns, is expected to be taxed to the fullest by a bunch of people unused to the subway in DC.  I expect severe problems.</p>
<p>As for me, I will spend Inauguration Day at my Eastern Shore home by my comfortable wood stove drinking beer and reading, not watching this Obama character shame my country.</p>

		<p>America&rsquo;s first mulatto president&rsquo; since that&rsquo;s what he is. He&rsquo;s neither black nor white in racial terms, he&rsquo;s mixed-race. </p>
<p>In fact, I would contend that mulatto is a separate race altogether.</p>
<p>Posted by A Swain at 6:39 PM on January 14 </p>
<p>Amen to this statement. Since he&rsquo;s half white, it&rsquo;s this white part of him that gives him the ability to be of above average intelligence, yet he&rsquo;s passed off as a black, which gives the false impression that blacks are this smart, and are really capable of being president of the United States. But even Obama isn&rsquo;t really qualified to become president with his limited experience. At least he&rsquo;s smart enough to surround himself with what looks like top quality advisors for his cabinet. Let&rsquo;s just hope his term doesn&rsquo;t turn into a disaster. <br>
Imagine if he was impeached and kicked out of office, how thousands of blacks would riot because of this. </p>

<p>&hellip;&#8221; Not all inaugurations have been lavish affairs. Thomas Jefferson eschewed much of the inaugural pomp and circumstance in 1801 and walked to the Capitol in casual clothing for his swearing in.  During the Second World War, Franklin Delano Roosevelt kept festivities for his 1945 inauguration to a minimum, holding a luncheon but no balls or parades&#8221;.</p>

I recall telling a white Kenyan some 40 years ago   &mdash;   who commented to me how humble and grateful the blacks were for any little favors or employment   &mdash;   that they may be grateful to you NOW for a job mowing your lawn or washing your clothes, but  the next generation will not be satisfied with that:  they will want your occupation and your house.

They also recently gave a huge hunk of money to La Raza.   <br>

<p>  <i>&ldquo;NEW YORK  &mdash;  Citigroup today announced a $105 million strategic partnership with the National Council of La Raza (NCLR).<br>
The core component of this partnership is a commitment to provide up to $100 million to finance [facilities]  located in Hispanic neighborhoods and/or serving Hispanic populations.
