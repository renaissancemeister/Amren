<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20090105/EU.Netherlands.Moroccan.Mayor/">Moroccan Immigrant Becomes Mayor of Rotterdam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The son of an Islamic preacher became the first Moroccan-born mayor of a Dutch city Monday, an appointment welcomed by his political friends and foes as a landmark in the successful integration of immigrants.</p>
<p>Ahmed Aboutaleb, a 47-year-old former journalist, has been compared to U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for breaching barriers that have long kept immigrants out of the Dutch corridors of power.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a turning point in Dutch history where integration has evolved to a level where people of Moroccan descent or Turkish descent are able to have the qualifications and the networks to become a mayor or a minister,&#8221; said Sadik Harchaoui, the head of Forum, an institute dedicated to promoting integration.</p>
<p>About 1 million of the country&rsquo;s 16 million people are immigrants.</p>
<p>Jan Franssen, Dutch Queen Beatrix&rsquo;s representative for South Holland province, played down the comparison with Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama on the Maas &hellip; is maybe going a bit far,&#8221; he said, referring to the river that bisects Rotterdam. &#8220;But the significance is great. This proves that there is no glass ceiling for immigrants in the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marco Pastors, who leads a Rotterdam political party faithful to Fortuyn&rsquo;s [Pim Fortuyn, who was gunned down in 2002] teachings, grudgingly welcomed Aboutaleb&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is morally upright and thinks immigrants must adapt to our Dutch values,&#8221; Pastors said. &#8220;He believes that they must take the chances the Netherlands offers and not sink into the role of victims. He can say what many do not dare say: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it here, then pack your bags.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aboutaleb signaled he would tackle tensions between the city&rsquo;s white Christian population and its growing Islamic immigrant community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Pastors praises that stance, he also challenged Aboutaleb, who has dual citizenship, to turn in his Moroccan passport as a sign of his commitment to the Netherlands. Aboutaleb refused to relinquish his passport when similar calls followed his appointment to Balkenende&rsquo;s Cabinet.</p>
<p>Pastors presented the new mayor with a gift of an envelope addressed to the Moroccan king and urged him to use it to send back his Moroccan passport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your position in this country brings this moral obligation with it,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>What is really, truly, truly rotten about this is that in the Netherlands Mayors are appointed by the Cabinet and Monarch. The Morroccans didn&rsquo;t even have to organize an election, the Queen and Cabinet gave them the Mayor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p><br>
wikepedia.org<br>
Main article: Mayor (the Netherlands)<br>
In the Netherlands, the mayor (in Dutch: burgemeester) is the leader of the municipal executive (&#8216;College van Burgemeester en Wethouders&rsquo;). In the Netherlands, burgermeesters are de facto appointed by the national cabinet, de jure by the monarch. They preside both the municipal executive and the legislative (&#8216;gemeenteraad&rsquo;). The title is sometimes translated as burgomaster, to emphasize the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; mayor has dual citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>How far down have a people fallen when they think that it&rsquo;s admirable to squeeze people alien to their traditions, culture and religion, into positions of power&#8221;</p>
<p>It is no doubt a mental aberration, and is a digusting example of how many fools are within the white population on earth. <br>

		<p>Behind the moderate face of this Arab is the mob of stone throwing, car burning, West hating invaders.  A jihad in Dutch clothing.<br>
     Note, BTW, the reference to one million immigrants out of a population of 16 million.  How many of the non-immigrant 15 million are the offspring of non-White foreigners?  The Associated Press would like us too imagine that the land of wooden shoes and dikes is still 94 percent White.  </p>

		<p>Collective insanity&hellip; I mean what other explanation would account for a third-world primitive to be elected MAYOR of a European city. Particularly offensive when this offal from Africa claims &#8220;dual citizenship.&#8221; Apparently not thinking highly enough of his adopted country to relinquish his Morrocan citizenship</p>
<p>As to that &#8220;insanity&#8221; excuse&hellip; Maybe some chemical ingredient or hallucinogenic drug is being introduced into the loca drinking water in European nations. It&rsquo;s like White Europeans can no longer think intelligently or something.</p>

<p>There is no glass ceiling for immigrants espcially if they are  members of the PVDA socialist tribe and muslim. They killed Pim Fortuyn to keep up appearance, and to add insult to injury Abo became Mayor of the city that Pim Fortuyn called home before he was murdered.</p>

		<p>Who allowed Moraccans in Holland?  Who voted one in to office?  Who allows dual citizenship?  The Dutch.<br>

Sending back his passport won&rsquo;t make him Dutch.  Voting to have a foreign power take over Rotterdam might.</p>

		<p>dual citizenships should not be allowed in any country. You can never be sure who they are loyal to.  Now it is time for Aboutaleb to show his loyalty to the Dutch by sending his passport back.</p>

<p>Yes. People don&rsquo;t really understand the extent of the invasion until they go there and see it for themselves.  Most Americans have no idea.  They still retain their mental image of the traditional Holland of wooden shoes and windmills, and little blond girls with pigtails.  Uh, uh!  That&rsquo;s sheer fantasy today.   Picture caftans and burkhas, and crowds of swarthy faces.  When I first went there - over 20 years ago  - I was amazed to see all the nonwhites thronging the streets &hellip; even THEN!   It must be much worse today.  The whole Third World has been pouring in all this time.</p>
<p>This is a situation that has been allowed to build up quietly for years  now, with no attention given to it until just recently when the  riots  and political murders began (something once unimaginable in peaceful, civilized  Holland).   There will doubtless be more.</p>

<p>The Netherlands have always been known as a haven of tolerance for religious and political dissenters. (Our own Puritans had taken refuge there before coming to America.)  But that was assumed to be for other Europeans.  And  just a few   &mdash;     never a mass migration that would swamp such a tiny country. (I imagine if the Puritans had numbered a million, the Dutch  back then would have not been so welcoming!)   After WW2, and the arrival of the jet age,  the whole world began coming and  the era of MASS MIGRATION  began   &mdash;   no longer just persecuted INDIVIDUALS or small groups, but by the millions.  Oh, and furthermore, these are  &#8220;economic refugees&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re not fleeing persecution; they&rsquo;re just looking for money, welfare, and a softer life.  They need to feed off someone else&rsquo;s prosperity because they couldn&rsquo;t build prosperous countries of their own. (I wonder why?)  They&rsquo;re looking for a ready-made,  orderly, just, and prosperous society <i>that they have not been able to create for themselves </i>&hellip;.  (and which they will inevitably destroy wherever they go, because they don&rsquo;t appreciate the  fundamentals that created it).</p>
<p>Can you imagine a Dutchman becoming mayor of Casablanca or Cairo?   I can&rsquo;t.<br>
In today&rsquo;s Europe, it not only can happen, it&rsquo;s applauded as a sign of &#8220;progress&#8221;.  Weird!</p>
<p>As for Charles Martel or William Wallace or Joan of Arc   &mdash;    those people would indeed be in prison today for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;   &mdash;   reviled by the press and denounced by all &#8220;respectable&#8221; politicians as bigots and xenophobes.   A complete inversion of normal values!     As you said, who is doing this to us?   Very weird indeed.</p>

<p>Actually, you can be fairly certain who he&rsquo;s loyal to: his fellow Moslems.  He may owe fealty to the paymasters who put him in his position, but in his gut he wants his people to triumph over the West.  </p>
