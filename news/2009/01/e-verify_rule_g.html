<h1><a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2009/01/28/everify-postponed.aspx">E-Verify Rule Governing Contractor Employees Postponed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alice Lipowicz, Federal Computer Week, January 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The government has agreed to postpone implementing the E-Verify regulation for federal contractors until May 21 at the earliest, a business group announced today. The regulation would require contractors to check the E-Verify system to determine if workers are legally eligible to work in the United States.</p>
<p>Federal officials agreed to a request by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to postpone enforcement of the regulation so the rule can be reviewed by the Obama administration, the chamber said in a news release today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, federal contractors don&rsquo;t need to comply with E-Verify until May 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government agreed that the new administration needs time to re-think mandatory E-Verify use, particularly in light of the stressed economy,&#8221; Robin Conrad, executive vice president of the chamber&rsquo;s public-policy law firm, said. &#8220;We are hopeful that the incoming administration will agree that E-Verify is the wrong solution at the wrong time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program allows employers to electronically submit Social Security numbers for their new hires and existing employees. If there is a match, the employee is deemed eligible to work. If not, there are procedures for further assessments.</p>

<p>How could there ever be a wrong time to confirm the legal status of a prospective employee?!</p>

			<p>&#8220;The wrong solution at the wrong time&#8221;. And when will it be the right time?. When employment rates go back up again, they will say that we need the efforts of illegal alien workers more now than ever.</p>

			<p>There are not words enough to express my revulsion at those liberals, &#8220;conservatives&#8221; and business people who would throw away one of the few chances this Country has to stem the hiring and employment of illegals. </p>
<p>The e-Verify regulation needs to be implemented soon, its criteria made stronger, and the penalties for those who hire illegals made tougher.</p>

			<p>Come on now where are they going to get the time to do that? When they are using every spare moment they have to rob the taxpayers blind? Obama means CHANGE alright CHANGE in your pocket instead of folding cash?</p>

			<p>To the American Chamber of Commerce and its minions - E-Verify is the BEST weapon we have against the invasion of our country. Haven&rsquo;t heard of YOUR solution - Oh, right! Stop the fence and send limos to the border to ferry the illegal to the jobs. As a representative of the business community of this country, the American Chamber of Commerce needs to step aside and let loyal Americans represent this nation, because they are selling us down the Rio Grande!</p>

			<p>Great. Anyone looking for a job out there? Well, you&rsquo;ve got more competition than you might have been expecting, say, last August. Because instead of getting rid of excess workers in the US, we, in our wisdom, think that flooding the market with even more is a better idea.</p>

			<p>Never forget what we&rsquo;re up against is the lying, profit-seeking, scoundrel that liberal capitalism creates.  I don&rsquo;t like spouting pinko statements like that but it&rsquo;s true.  Combine profit-seeking with (genocidal) leftist rationalization and faux justification, and you&rsquo;ve got a real monster on your hands.</p>

			<p>I suspect that there was never any genuine intention of implementing E-Verify, and that the whole program is just another Beltway smoke &amp; mirrors con job perpetrated on the US public.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable, utterly unbelieavable. To the leaders of this nation, American citizens come last over illegal aliens and those who entered the U.S. yesterday  &mdash;  every single time and on every important issue. The constant question however, at least to me is, how much of it is self inflicted by us, because of our inaction and apathy on the things we damn well could change.</p>

			<p>It would be so nice if they would show the same kindness and consideration to the people who built this country through their hard work.</p>

			<p> It seems to me that all the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce to prevent illegals from being found and deported has the effect of preferring illegal workers to US workers. <br>
 Is this not discrimination against US workers because they are US citizens ?</p>

			<p>It is obvious that the Chamber of Commerce is an un-American organization.</p>

			<p>Boycott any and every firm you believe hires illegal aliens. This is the only thing that will work. Deny them your money and they will get religion. Love of money makes them hire illegal aliens, a good LONG boycott will give them a good reason to change their evil behaviors. You already know where to start. Walk out of the store or restaurant with your money still tucked in your pocket. If they ask&hellip;.tell them&hellip;..get rid of the illegal aliens and then you will come back to shop.</p>
