			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Right Perspective, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white professor and anti-racist activist has been savagely beaten by an African-American man on the streets of Washington, DC just days before the inauguration of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>62-year old JoAnne Silver Jones was mugged on Jan. 16 while on her way to see her adopted daughter. Jones was beat on her head, arms and hands with a brick by her African-American male assailant during the attack, according to long-time friend Patricia Romney. &#8220;He beat her face so badly that she was unable to open her eyes, and one eye socket was torn by the blows,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jones is an associate professor in the School of Human Services at Springfield College and director of the social work program. She has co-authored a paper titled, &#8220;Feminist Strategies for Teaching About Oppression&#8221; and was involved with &#8220;cross-cultural issues&#8221; including a 1999 incident at Amherst Regional High School where Puerto Rican students protested the school&rsquo;s production of &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jones is still recovering at George Washington University Hospital after undergoing surgery on her skull and eye, but may be released this weekend, Romney said. &#8220;She can walk a little but is nauseous and headachy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She&rsquo;s a tough cookie, but this is totally traumatizing. It&rsquo;s going to be a long way back.&#8221; Jones will need additional surgery on both hands, which are still bandaged from her elbows to her fingertips.</p>
<p>Romney said she is struck by what she termed the &#8220;paradox of it all&#8221;  &mdash;  a white anti-racism activist, the first African-American president and a mugger identified as African-American. To test Jones&rsquo; brain, doctors asked her the name of the new president, and she answered correctly. &#8220;This won&rsquo;t shake any of her political activism,&#8221; Romney said of Jones. &#8220;She&rsquo;s clear about what the issues are. This won&rsquo;t sway her desire to keep fighting for social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; spouse Deborah King will be nursing her back to health. Jones&rsquo; assailant remains at large.<br>

			<p>Of course this won&rsquo;t sway her commitment to &#8220;social justice.&#8221;  Before the brick even connected with her face, she&rsquo;d already convinced herself that it was our racist society that had compelled her assailant to attack her.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no paradox here at all. Blacks attack whites because they are white. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the white is a neo-Marxist (&#8216;anti-racist&rsquo;) or a Klansman. The only fools who don&rsquo;t get that are such white neo-Marxists. What his comes down to is simply another white lesbian taking chances in a dangerous neighborhood because she thinks black criminals are her &#8216;allies.&rsquo; And no - she will not learn anything from this incident at all.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s really sad is that people like this will most likely not change their beliefs. Even when presented with incontrovertible facts or becoming a victim themselves, the liberal will usually refuse to see the truth. I guess the humiliation of having been duped or feeling like a fool is greater than their survival instinct. </p>

			<p>Some people simply cannot be taught. How can she be a professor and learn nothing from her incident?</p>
<p>When we as whites act like this, we deserve to lose our place in history.</p>

			<p>There really is no logical comment a reasonable person can make about people like Ms.Silver Jones. Not really. &#8220;NOT&#8221; being able to relate to someone who writes academic papers with titles like,&#8221;Feminist Strategies for Teaching about Oppression&#8221;,is, for most folks  &mdash;  about as natural as a babys smile. It just can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>In any case I sincerely hope Ms.Silver Jones recovers without too much pain from her brutally inflicted wounds.</p>

			<p><b>What number are we up to when counting the number of &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; assaulted by their protected class heroes? I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t count that high.</b></p>
<p>This story is run of the mill now, but the line which stands out most (IMO) is:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>[JoAnne Silver] Jones&rsquo; <b>spouse</b> Deborah King will be nursing her back to health.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Spouse???</b><br>
Aww, how cute. We&rsquo;ve reached such a level of depravity in this once-great country, that this sentence is written with the same nonchalance as if they were writing about a ten-year old stealing a piece of bubble gum from a candy store (except candy stores don&rsquo;t exist anymore)&hellip;</p>

			<p>Wow. I have to remind myself that I&rsquo;ve performed all kinds of ideological gymnastics myself to avoid the truth about black criminality, even after several assaults and a home invasion. It wasn&rsquo;t until I spent a few years working in the low-income housing industry that I realized what a complete crock white guilt is. I think it arises from the noblest of intentions but after over 40 years of whites bending over backwards to accommodate blacks only to see each generation turn out more savage than the last it&rsquo;s obviously a bottomless pit. I wish Ms. Jones the best but doubt she&rsquo;ll see the light even after this. A friend of mine, brilliant guy, was beaten mercilessly outside his house by a pack of blacks for asking them to move out of the way so that he could pull into his driveway. His take on the situation? &#8220;Poverty makes people angry&#8221;. Funny, I&rsquo;ve been at or near the poverty level for a long time now, but I&rsquo;ve never taken to beating people half to death because of it. Must be a white thing.    </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not struck by the &#8220;paradox of it all,&#8221; Miss Romney.  In fact, knowing blacks the way I do, it&rsquo;s perfectly consistent behavior, that they trash the very same people that think they&rsquo;re doing them favors.  The black thugs think of white panderers as weak, and therefore prey.</p>

<p>Expecting someone who is so obviously mentally disturbed to somehow come to her senses all at once just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  She&rsquo;s one of many whites who are no more than damaged goods, and if she is to realize any return to normalcy she needs literally years of intense psychotherapy, and even at that, unfortunately, she still probably won&rsquo;t recover.</p>
<p>Out of X number of whites in the US, many of them are going to be as ill as she is.  Unless dramatic advancements are made in the area of mental health, we just have to work around people like her.</p>

			<p>We just found the 2009 winner for the &#8220;Amy Biehl&#8221; award!</p>
<p><i>Romney said she is struck by what she termed the &ldquo;paradox of it all&rdquo; &mdash; a white anti-racism activist, the first African-American president and a mugger identified as African-American.</i></p>
<p>Most white liberals delude themselves into believing that their &#8220;colour-blindess&#8221;, exclusivity by dating non-whites, donating to &#8220;La Raza&#8221; or any &#8220;ethnic&#8221; charity or even having insert-minority-here friends is some magical barrier that prevents them from being mugged, raped, killed etc by non-whites.<br>
Case in Point: <a href="https://newsouthwails.blogspot.com/2008/08/liberal-susan-crain-bakos-gets-mugged.html" rel="nofollow">50+ white &#8220;sexpert&#8221; (who wrote a newspaper paean on why she &#8220;exclusively dates&#8221; black men now) is not only mugged by her black boytoy, but the surrounding blacks don&rsquo;t lift a finger to help!</a></p>
<p><i>&#8220;This won&rsquo;t sway her desire to keep fighting for social justice.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I suppose she&rsquo;ll apologise to the black criminal, as her white skin incited the poor fellow to &#8220;avenge the wrongs the White Man&hellip;&#8221; etc etc.</p>

			<p>I wonder why she was beaten so savagely? Was the assailant just a masochist (even more so than usual, that is)? Or did she resist handing over her purse because she couldn&rsquo;t believe that a noble, oppressed black man would really take money from her? Maybe she thought he would be able to read the &#8220;goodness in her heart&#8221; and realize that she wasn&rsquo;t one of those &#8220;racist&#8221; white people and so didn&rsquo;t deserve to have her money taken? In other words, fantasy land all the way.</p>
<p>This incident may not &#8220;shake any of her political activism,&#8221; but I&rsquo;ll bet she will be a little more careful about walking  alone in certain cities from now on. Her kind of &#8220;political activism&#8221; is one of the things that led to our cities being so unsafe in the first place.</p>

			<p>Of course this &#8220;incident&#8221; won&rsquo;t change her outlook on race, to be an anti-white liberal you must disregard reality in the first place.  I imagine she will just project that a rich white republican attacked her.</p>

			<p>Well isn&rsquo;t that special?  A gay social work prof is nearly killed by a  black and she probably won&rsquo;t admonish him because he is black.  </p>
<p>Ideals are fine as long as you don&rsquo;t get hurt for them.  Remember the human shields in Iraq before shock and awe?  When they found out it was actually going to be dangerous they wanted to leave.  </p>

			<p>This would be front page news if a white skinhead did this to a black woman on the &#8220;Chosen One&rsquo;s&#8221; inauguration. I can just see CNN and Nancy Grace tripping over themselves asking for the public&rsquo;s assistance in hunting down the evil white supremacist. BTW, do you think hate crime charges would ever be filed against this black mugger if it was ever caught?</p>

			<p>You see, people, there is no convincing them. </p>
<p>Liberals will literally &#8220;take a beating&#8221;, and still will declare their solidarity with the black man. The Music Videos blacks produce showing innocent whites being murdered in their homes don&rsquo;t sway them. The rap lyrics talking (and I use that word loosely) about killing whites doesn&rsquo;t sway them. Statistics about black on white crime doesn&rsquo;t sway them. Even being personally beaten and their bones broken does not sway them.</p>
<p>We are going this one alone&hellip;</p>

			<p>She&rsquo;s probably not all that interested in finding her assailant, but by gum, she&rsquo;s sticking to her commitment to social injustice.  <br>
How about the injustice to the society that is in danger of an attack by her assailant as long as he remains at large?<br>
Nothing about that in the article.</p>

She can act brave now but when the reality of permanent pain and effects finaly comes about she will slowly start to hate those she now claims to want to help.</p>

Why do some people seem to be completely unable to learn from their own mistakes?</p>
<p>On the other hand &ldquo;&hellip;this won&rsquo;t sway her desire to keep fighting for social justice.&rdquo; sounds like brave words for now.</p>
<p>But will she REALLY not tremble in fear when she&rsquo;s walking down the street in the future and chances upon a menacing looking &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; male? <br>

			<p>For the story of a 3rd generation marxist bisexual  who loved blacks check out these websites.  The worst of it was that she was married for many years to a very handsome, nice, good provider white husband, Marvin Stender.  Then she left him  to live with some black criminals.  She wasn&rsquo;t a kid, she was in her late thirties.  A few years later when black criminals became passe, she left her black panther lover for a woman.</p>
<p>No one ever deserved an unhappy ending more than Faye Stender.</p>
<p>Her unspeakable son, despite what happened to his Mother, filed the lawsuit that prevents California white prisoners from &#8220;congregating&#8221; in groups of more than 2.  This law that her son created through Judicial diktat means that 2 or more white convicts speaking with each other is considered a &#8220;racist&#8221; gang.</p>
<p>Her son is also involved with Tim Wise and the museum of tolerance &#8220;whites must be eradicted&#8221; program, even though his own Mother was assaulted and severely handicapped by her beloved black guerrilla family criminal clients and lovers.</p>
<p>Of course black, asian and hispanic convicts forming prison gangs is just fine with the California Judiciary which is determined to wipe out all whites in California including white prisoners.</p>
<p>The law has had an unintended effect.  Because the Judges gave permission and encouragement to blacks and hispanics to prey on white prisoners, white criminals have either reformed or somehow managed to avoid prison. So liberals are now all upset because the percentage of whites in California prisons is so low in comparision to minorities.</p>

			<p>Too bad it didn&rsquo;t happen 30 years ago.  She would have been in a nursing home instead of teaching anti white racism and hatred to college students.</p>
<p>At her age, she won&rsquo;t fully recover.  What goes around comes around.  She hates whites, blacks hate her.  Her anti white teaching career has done a lot more damage to the white cause than her black assailant did to her.</p>

			<p>I was just talking about this today with an aquaintance, and there are two things about this article relevant to our talk. </p>
<p>The first has to do with the Left&rsquo;s going on non-stop about Social Justice.  The second has to do with their obsession, not so much with non-whites and the oppressed, as it does with - <br>
Salvation Systems!</p>
<p>As to the first, how can it be, I mean, HOW can it be, that a person devotes their entire life to &#8220;social injustice&#8221; and never, I mean NEVER bothers to do two simple things?<br>
1 - Define the words, Society, and Justice.<br>
2 - Talk seriously and intelligently about the matrix of society<br>
    itself, The Family.</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of this, the Left has been pretty much successful in taking over Society and dominating the discussion about, well, everything, as it sets the terms of every &#8220;discussion&#8221; (read &#8220;lecture&#8221;) and insists on being the only one who can define the words used in such &#8220;discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can that be?  </p>
<p>I can not give my reasons here and so, for the sake of space, must go straight to the conclusions.  <br>
The Right is an inversion of the Left and Polarization is the problem. And, because the Left is far more focused on Quantity over Quality than the Right, and that the Right, for the most part, simply wants to be left alone, it has been absolutely powerless over the Left, obviously. </p>
<p>For the Right to truly figure out what the Left is doing it would have to cease being Right-wing.  Because, as I said, a huge part of the problem is the Polarization between the two, before which the Right has been powerless, and are now simply being sumbsumed, absorbed and gobbled up by the Monster.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that Race Realism is strictly a Conservative movement, or that our problems today are amendable through the use of solutions coming from the Right (are there any?) is simply part of the problem.</p>

			<p>I generally feel that black-on-white violence is, needless to say, a horrible thing and a symptom of a sick, upside down society. But I am willing to make an exception if the white being beaten is an &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; leftoid ideologue. This opinion might sound harsh (at least to clueless people who live a sheltered life), but when you consider the extreme damage these &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; zealots have done to our society via the educational system, mainstream media, and entertainment industry, I tend to feel such incidents are poetic justice.</p>

Bears usually don&rsquo;t attack humans. There are only a few such cases every year. Would it be unreasonable then to stay away from bears or to call animal control when bear is in my back yard?</p>

			<p>Another Amy Biehl, without the excuse of youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Romney said she is struck by what she termed the &ldquo;paradox of it all&rdquo; &mdash; &#8221;</p>
<p>What &#8220;paradox?&#8221; There&rsquo;s nothing paradoxical about it; it&rsquo;s just another example of mindless, everyday black violence. People like Ms. Romney seem to think their high opinion of themselves is objectively justified and can somehow be perceived by others, like an invisible halo. &#8220;Yo, Jamal, don&rsquo;t mug her; she&rsquo;s an anti-racism activist.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for &#8220;social justice,&#8221; if the phrase has any meaning at all, it would best be served by the apprehension and swift, sure punishment of the offender. No doubt Ms. Romney believes that &#8220;law and order&#8221; is another of the white man&rsquo;s afro-oppressing social constructs and is in need of deconstructing.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been the target of racism myself  &mdash;  coming from blacks, and I&rsquo;m white.</p>
<p>For example, when I was 16 I had my first job in a fast-food joint in the Detroit suburbs  &mdash;  a suburb that borders Detroit, I might add.  I was the only white employee there!  I had to put up with a little bit of sexual harassment (pretty minor, but still) from a couple of the guys.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do, always had to ask, because no one bothered to sit me down and tell me exactly what my duties were (years later I would have someone tell me that I hadn&rsquo;t been properly trained).</p>
<p>My dad asked the manager why I wasn&rsquo;t getting a lot of hours, and she flat-out told him that white girls don&rsquo;t work as well as black girls.  (It&rsquo;s taken me 20 years since that time to figure out that that is a bald-faced lie.)</p>
<p>Dad, being the kind of man he was, did NOT let that drop!  He filed a complaint!  The manager didn&rsquo;t get fired, though, she got transferred as far as I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known decent black people, but they seem to be few and far between.  I will continue to treat people with civility no matter what race, but I will not forget how most blacks can be.  There&rsquo;s being nice, then there&rsquo;s being a doormat.</p>

The old saying was, &#8220;A moderate is a liberal who just got mugged.&#8221; It should be modified to, &#8220;A White liberal anti-racist who still feels that way after being mugged by a black thug is an absolute dolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, I wonder how she explains the government set-asides, entitlements and preferences written into law for blacks only. To a would be messiah, it just isn&rsquo;t enough. </p>

True.  And it was awfully racist of her to get in the way of that underprivileged man&rsquo;s brick.  Was she blocking his swing because she just couldn&rsquo;t let the black man be free?

			<p>&#8220;We are going this one alone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe not so much. Me and my circle of friends are to the left of Gandhi on most things, but as high rents in the city are forcing some to outlying areas and housing projects are broken up and spreading thug culture throughout the suburbs, even us pinkos are being forced to experience thug culture and the black community&rsquo;s refusal to deal with it. It&rsquo;s not everyone, and nobody wants to go into full Archie Bunker mode, but I think people are getting pissed. I still acknowledge that white people were mean to blacks for a long time and that&rsquo;s too bad, but I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it and I no longer feel any sense of responsibility for what blacks are going through, and that seems to be the gist of what some of my other friends are feeling. Speculation about who&rsquo;s to blame for the black plight may have been relevant once, but not any more. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens if enough libs start to feel the way we do.</p>

			<p>Men, who are in combat, know that there is a substantial risk of being a casualty of &#8220;friendly fire&#8221;. That is, damage inflicted by their side, not the enemy. Most accept such casualties stoically, with the attitude that if it were not for the evil enemy, the casualties would not have occurred.</p>
<p>This seems to be the attitude of Feminist Silver-Jones: The enemy is the evil White man; she and her Black mugger are both victims. If White men did not dominate her social environment, the attack would not have occurred.<br>

A man, or a race, can be greatly outnumbered, but still have a chance if the attackers are three legged dogs.  </p>

			<p>Please note her maiden name, Silver.</p>
<p>Most likely she is of Jewish stock and has a suicidal death wish of rationalizing incessant, primitive and violent behavior.  I have met people who have been attacked and they literally blame themselves for not contributing more of their earnings or purposely demoted themselves (or their relatives) for the reasons of &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trying to understand non-Western behavior and consistently promoting and excusing abhorrant behavior (see Sha&rsquo;ria Law) by attacking oneself is clincal.</p>
<p>I knew someone robbed at an ATM and they were shaken, but made it a point to &#8220;not hate blacks&#8221; which, was admirable.  I wonder if blacks robbed by whites at the ATM would have the same reaction?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t evoke much sympathy for an anti-racist activist who got mugged by a Black. Call it &#8220;social justice&#8221; of a different sort, I suppose. Blacks being Blacks&hellip; are the reason I carry. A loaded 9mm. automatic is a damned good insurance policy against being attacked. My position is: If Blacks want MY blood&hellip; well, they&rsquo;d better be willing to shed a lot of their own at first. No, I don&rsquo;t fancy myself as a latter-day rambo or Deathwish Bronson. I simply feel that minorities acting like they do, self-defense ultimately is up to us as individuals.</p>

			<p>While I&rsquo;m outraged that this woman was mugged and beaten, I gotta say that I do believe in karma.  I&rsquo;m also interested to find out that she was behind the Amherst Regional High School incident of ten years ago, which was not PR students protesting West Side Story as was reported&hellip;it was one or two PR parents who whined, and the European American administration caved, and they ended up showing the &#8220;Vagina Monologues&#8221; instead, and all the far-left extremists showed up en masse to view a play about statutory rape involving two lesbians.  Incidents such as this are why people state-wide and now even nation-wide are starting to say &#8220;Only in Amherst&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Also, notice how this woman says she&rsquo;s going to keep fighting for social justice..one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about far-left extremists:  THEY NEVER ADMIT TO BEING WRONG!!!!  Mass. residents please note all the taxes and cuts Governor Deval &#8220;Coupe De Val&#8221; Patrick wants to impose on us  &mdash;    &mdash;  the far left screamed when Romney did it, but nary a whisper about their beloved Deval doing it.  </p>

And in fact, if its obvious from her appearance (the thick body type, male wardrobe, the short spike hair, ect.), it may very well have been a motivating factor in the attack.

<p>We&rsquo;ll have to answer that in another post.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my take on it.</p>
<p>I can not give my reasons here and so, for the sake of space, must go straight to the conclusions.  <br>
The Right is an inversion of the Left and Polarization is the problem. <br>
Because the Left is far more focused on Quantity over Quality than the Right, and since the Right, for the most part, simply wants to be left alone, it has been absolutely powerless over the Left, obviously. </p>
<p>For the Right to truly figure out what the Left is doing it would have to cease being Right-wing.  Because, as I said, a huge part of the problem is the Polarization between the two, before which the Right has been powerless, and are now simply being sumbsumed, absorbed and gobbled up by the Monster.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that Race Realism is strictly a Conservative movement, or that our problems today are amendable through the use of solutions coming from the Right (are there any?) is simply part of the problem.<br>

I have known women like that. (Why is it usually women? Margaret has given us that answer in the past.) Much more typically, though, they are willing to sacrifice YOU than themselves. In this case, it didn&rsquo;t work that way!   Maitre&rsquo;D (above) sees the picture most clearly: they&rsquo;re not so much self-hating, as YOU-hating. It&rsquo;s part of their general struggle against the ambient society, a desire to tear down everything that is yours or which represents you. Patriarchal, male, Western, Christian society is The Enemy.  It must must be atacked ruthlessly on every front and must be destroyed.</p>
<p>As Mr. Kelly shrewdly summed it up,  &#8220;she needs literally years of intense psychotherapy [to cure her obsession]&hellip; until then, we&rsquo;ll just have to work around people like her.&#8221;   Agreed. Some people are beyond reason and beyond changing.</p>

			<p>Tom Iron, I understand your philosophy, which is essentially, &#8220;We are civilized and better than asserting hateful comments. We cannot reduce ourselves to the level of inferiors without diminishing who we are.&#8221; I understand, but I disagree in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Your ideas apply in a refined, cultured civilization. We no longer have that luxury in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>I submit to the group that maintaining such an apathetic worldview, as Tom suggests, while apologetically distancing ourselves from our views, is partially responsible for the declining predicament of our race.</p>
<p>We are in a war of ideology. One cannot remain &#8220;reserved, pristine, and above the fray&#8221; indefinitely in a war. Politically correct pacifism is simply not working. It is time to allow for some anger and truth to surface in our comments. Yes, White people are capable of feeling and expressing anger. We are not emotionless.</p>
<p>I am a peaceful, civilized, responsible, Conservative White man. The &#8220;ugly&#8221; truth is that I feel a sense of justice and vindication when I read stories about White Liberals, who espouse disgusting, anti-White worldviews, learning counter-lessons at the hands of Blacks. I am not ashamed of my feelings. I am merely being honest.</p>
<p>I suggest that people who think that we should not express such views should reevaluate your views. If you find you cannot, then perhaps you should join the new Michael Steele Republican Party and lobby for the other side. There will not be a middle ground for apathy or political correctness when history passes judgment. </p>
<p>Remember: White people did not settle civilization by talking in hushed, cowered tones.</p>
<p>In closing, I appeal to all Whites to rapidly organize and selectively identify and boycott the most anti-White businesses in all western nations. Put your race before your wallet. Pay a little extra to avoid destroying your own race. We have a lot of monetary clout if we act together, and, of course, within the confines of the law.</p>

<p>A bit of a correction for you, civilized.  Blacks don&rsquo;t attack Klansmen, they run from them.  The idea of angry white people with guns would most likely scare any african-american senseless.  I&rsquo;ve always considered the way blacks act as comparable to children suppressing fear.  They, like all minorities, are afraid of us, don&rsquo;t expect them to admit it though.</p>
<p>Why do you think they attack in packs?  Aside from their gang mentality, of course.</p>

<p>Had to have a chuckle at that.  Gandhi was a lawyer in South Africa in his younger days.  Nowadays he&rsquo;s not the darling of the left in SA, because of course the blacks are in power now.  Gandhi was under no illusions about Africans; he openly despised them. His comments are worse than pornography in the new regime.</p>
<p>Margaret, thank you for those links. I&rsquo;ve missed your comments (assuming you&rsquo;re the same Margaret who used to post here a couple of years ago). Always thoughtful and provocative.</p>
<p>Finally, I must agree with Tom Iron@2:49.  Yes, she brought it on herself. Yes, she&rsquo;s a deplorable human being on many levels.  But she&rsquo;s a white woman. We should not tolerate or condone this kind of atrocity by black thugs.  Amy Biehl was also a white woman.  She was killed in my home town.  When I read about how &#8220;the community is divided&#8221; over whether her murder was a &#8220;good thing&#8221;, I see red.  White people need to get a backbone. These are <em>our</em> women; if they need to be punished, corrected or educated, that&rsquo;s <em>our</em> job and <em>our</em> prerogative, and we&rsquo;ll do it <em>our</em> way.  But we must protect them from attack by others.  I&rsquo;m sure this particular thug had no idea that he was an instrument of cosmic retribution; he&rsquo;s just a thug.  Our grandfathers would have known their duty;  it&rsquo;s time Whites rediscovered the neglected virtue of righteous anger.</p>
<p>(Please note, I&rsquo;m not advocating lynching.  Once, our society had institutions that dispensed real justice. We have lost so much!)</p>

<p>Sir, I think you&rsquo;ve taken my post incorrectly. What I meant was as we&rsquo;re the good guys, we shouldn&rsquo;t sink to the level of those we&rsquo;re dealing with. This bum didn&rsquo;t work that woman over for any other reason than she was White. We must realize that and understand that it is our duty as men to protect our women if we can. If I&rsquo;d seen that happening, I would have thrown myself on that bum. If I&rsquo;d known her beliefs, I&rsquo;d still have done it. In the case of this particular type of woman, she probably would have condemned me for trying to help her. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. It is our duty now. We must stand up for our people 100%, no matter what.</p>
<p>Also, I think all ideas of there being a peaceful reconciliation between us and the minorities is insanity. We have only one possible ally amongst the minorities. They are the Orientals. Not the South Asians. The Hispanics and blacks must be expelled from this country in the end. There will be mounds of dead unfortunately, but that is the price that will have to be paid.</p>

			<p>To Tom Iron:</p>
<p>Tom, I apologize to you for the boldness of my previous post. I have long respected what you post, and I still do.</p>
<p>I simply disagree with your position on this matter.</p>
<p>Sure, I would come to the defense of a fellow White person if I saw her (or him) being attacked by minorities. However, if I knew this woman, and I knew of her background as an anti-White activist, I would definitely not intervene in any way. She is an enemy, Tom. Of that, there can be no doubt. Her kind is not worth saving. She, and those like her, are a very heavy burden to the rest of civilzation, including the decency, morality, and the good in higher-quality people.</p>
<p>Yes, I am thankful she was beaten down, and I am not ashamed to say so.</p>
<p>Although, I am a very good, generous, giving person by nature, I have finally learned to reserve my natural, altruistic nature for people who merit it. To do otherwise is to lend to my own destruction and the destruction of my race. There is no hope for people like Silver Jones and the thug who beat her down. If the authorities catch and imprison her assailant, then, I would note that two enemies have been removed from action.</p>
<p>I simply refuse to extend any helping hand to Blacks, Hispanics, or Liberal Whites, whatsoever. To do so is helping the enemy. I simply do not engage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a perfect example of my views today:</p>
<p>During a meeting last year, I silently noted a mouthy Black man standing directly in front of a heavy door across the room; a door that opens inward. I saw the danger, and the liklihood, of the door opening in on him suddenly. My natural inclination was to &#8220;warn and protect&#8221;. I kept my mouth shut on purpose. In a few minutes, someone bolted into the room and jammed the door into his shoulder, injuring him, and causing him to spill coffee all over himself. Likewise, I would have held my tongue if an obnoxious, White Liberal were standing there.</p>
<p>As petty as that may seem to some, it is not petty to me. That is where I stand today. I no longer help the enemy in any way. I will not act outside of the confines of the law, but I refuse to help my enemies by providing them with the benefits of my care, awareness, wisdom, or action. They already enjoy the benefits of my taxes, distributed to them by the government Marxists. I am forced to give to my enemies, under duress, with the threat of violence at the hands of the government Marxists if I refuse to give them my money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to selectively withhold care, help, and intervention, my friends, unless the government Marxists force you to.</p>
<p>That is where I stand. It&rsquo;s going to become much, much worse.</p>

<p>I commend you on your belief that it is the duty of men to protect women. But it doesn&rsquo;t happen. I have said before that women and girls are grossly underprotected in our society. And perhaps some women think that they are best protected from black men by choosing to be in a relationship with one black man.<br>
What happens in mixed schools? Do the white boys stand together to resist the black bullies? Do they protect the girls? White men need to be taught their duties when they are boys. Yet I have known families where the man does not even protect his wife form their abusive children.</p>

Yet at the same time fail to grasp the reality of life. No amount of evidence will seem to sway the liberal educated elite, and this applies to liberals in South Africa too by the way.

			<p>I agree with every word you said &#8220;Anonymous at 11:32 A.M.&#8221;. Tom iron is wrong on this one. This kind of White liberal is our enemy- - not the non-Whites. The non-Whites are just doing what they&rsquo;re ALLOWED to do by these idiots. They have ALLOWED this country to be overrun with 3rd world garbage. They have ALLOWED our neighborhoods and schools to be ruined by infusing &#8220;inner city&#8221; thugs into them. They are the ones that have ALLOWED laws to be passed that make Whites the crimminal when trying to protect themselves and their property from these &#8220;inner-city yufs&#8221;. I could go on, but you get my drift. I also would NEVER help a known White liberal, in any altercation they might have with a non-White. In fact, I&rsquo;d probably try to film it so I could watch it over and over again when ever I needed a good laugh. I ALSO don&rsquo;t help non-Whites or liberals. Awhile back I noticed a black guy with his hood up in the parking lot as I exited a store. He yelled over to me asking if I had jumper cables. I wanted to say &#8220;of course I&rsquo;ve got jumper cables, I&rsquo;m White&#8221; but I told him no and went about my business. I thought I&rsquo;m SURE some White liberal will be along shortly and probably give you HIS battery out of his car so you won&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s &#8220;RACISSS&#8221;. </p>

<p>In this day and age, with the economy collapsing, no woman, especially a White woman, should be in a position where she is unable to protect herself and her children.  The ONLY thing that stops a rape is a handgun.</p>
<p>Women:  Arm yourselves. Take a firearms safety class and practice at the gun range.  Learn to use deadly force with extreme prejudice.  Secure your home with a security system. If you are lucky enough to live in a state where it is legal to carry a gun, carry one.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Another point if I may. Whenever this situation we find ourselves in becomes outright hostilities, we are going to be engulfed in a life of violence unseen since the days of WWII. During this time, we must strive to keep our heads thinking correctly. Even though we&rsquo;ll be in the conflict up to our eyeballs, we must somehow at all times continue to be American White Nationalists. Never sinking to the level of the minorities who will lose all remaining control of themselves and become no better. Even worse. What good would our ultimate victory be if we were just like our adversaries?</p>

I have reservations about that.  I think you&rsquo;re wrong.  You&rsquo;re being naive.  This woman has no automatic right to be protected by the people whom she has been  working day and night, all her life, to destroy.   We did nothing to harm her, nor even wished her ill,  but she got what she deserved anyway, and not through our doing.    Additionally, as some have said above, there is a valid question as to whether she should be considered white at all. I&rsquo;ll not get into that, but if she wants to go over and join the other  side, then treat her as such.  She&rsquo;s part of the other team. She&rsquo;s a racial enemy. She can&rsquo;t work against us, and still be protected by us!  That&rsquo;s just foolishness on our part.  We&rsquo;ve been doing that sort of thing for too long&hellip;.  and letting people like her get away with it, playing both sides, enjoying the benefits of both. In short, people have to understand that there are consequences for their actions; so let her take the consequences for hers, which means no help or sympathy from us.</p>
<p>PS: As for the person who compared her to Amy Biel,  Amy may have been pro-black, as many naive, well meaning young people are, but I&rsquo;m not aware that she was an anti-white agitator who had dedicated her lifetime to  working against whites and poisoning the minds of others, as had this Ms. Silver-Jones.<br>

I have reservations about that. I think you&rsquo;re wrong. You&rsquo;re being naive. This woman has no automatic right to be protected by the people whom she has been working day and night, all her life, to destroy. We did nothing to harm her, nor even wished her ill, but she got what she deserved anyway, and not through our doing. Additionally, as some have said above, there is a valid question as to whether she should be considered white at all. I&rsquo;ll not get into that, but if she wants to go over and join the other side, then treat her as such. She&rsquo;s part of the other team. She&rsquo;s a racial enemy. She can&rsquo;t work against us, and still be protected by us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely right on!!!!!!  In an ideal world, the white feminazis would be sent to live in all black enclaves.  They are the most detestable of whites, although the affirmative action white male judges should also be sent to live in all black enclaves along with their entire families.</p>
<p>Who is worse?  Affirmative action pro criminal judges and attorneys like Alan Derschowitz or the white feminazis who run the education system in this country?</p>

			<p> &mdash; remember to also take your name off of any and all transplant lists as transplant teams are now disproportionately favoring non-Whites and even illegal immigrants over Whites in the distribution of scarce organs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that we Whites are the victims of specious, government-enforced AA &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be damned if they&rsquo;re going to subject my and my children&rsquo;s organs to AA policies and quotas as well.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>I agree.  And it&rsquo;s not just organs.  Here in S California the medical establishment is withdrawing all kinds of medical care from whites to give to non whites and immigrants.</p>

			<p>Margaret at 4:08PM, has brought up a point that I have to agree with, otherwise,not doing so would be naive on my part. While I feel sorry for the pain and suffering Ms. JoAnne Silver Jones had to go through, Margaret is correct,in saying that the type of activism this women has been involved in for a good many years is dangerous. It is dangerous to innocent white people, when people like Ms.Silver Jones write inflammitory things about all whites, in a general way, that no doubt influences many weak minded individuals to commit mayhem on white people.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know, exactly how many of the weaker minded individuals who are among black or other races, have killed, maimed, or otherwise attacked whites because of the kind of activism carried on by the Silver Jonese&rsquo;s of the world. Talk about hate crimes. Margaret and others have brought up a very serious point concerning this article. The big picture, is so often overlooked, or perhaps intentionally overlooked by many leftist activists, who it can be argued, are engaging in provocative, irresponsible and dangerous behavior against whites, where many of their &#8220;activist&#8221; activities are concerned.</p>

White Nurse:</p>
<p>Your original post on the anti-White quota system of how scarce organs are distributed is what prompted me to remove my name from all transplant donor lists  &mdash;  I have made my wishes known to my family orally and in writing as well.  </p>
<p>I have told my children and husband that under NO circumstances will I donate their organs unless I am assured that they will go strictly to Whites.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor writes in Paved With Good Intentions that blacks will not donate their organs because they&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll go to Whites  &mdash;  even though blacks make up a disproportionate number of those waiting for transplants.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank you for your original post, it is saved on my hard drive and every once in a while I pull it up and become infuriated all over again.  I am reminded once again why I am not and will never be an organ donor.</p>
<p>From the article &#8220;Liver goes to the sickest, access for blacks improves&#8221; (about kidney transplants): </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the years after the change, 849 blacks, or 47 percent, got transplants compared to 8,492 whites, or 42 percent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/11/livers_go_to_si.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/11/livers_go_to_si.php</a></p>
<p>And this from Brenda Walker:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the LA Times reported scandalous organ transplants for known foreign criminals: Four Japanese gang figures received livers at UCLA. The article noted&hellip; &#8216;more than 100 patients died awaiting liver transplants in the greater Los Angeles region&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://blog.vdare.com/archives/2008/05/31/american-generosity-abused-in-organ-transplants/</p>
<p>And this about illegal immigrants receiving organ transplants in the US:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;she was in the country illegally, state health officials might grant her full Medi-Cal coverage&hellip; her benefits were restored and she is now awaiting a fourth transplant at UCLA&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for cluing us in on what anti-White activities are going on in the medical profession.</p>

			<p> <i>I agree with every word you said &ldquo;Anonymous at 11:32 A.M.&rdquo;. Tom iron is wrong on this one. <br>
 <br>
<b>This kind of White liberal is our enemy- - not the non-Whites. The non-Whites are just doing what they&rsquo;re ALLOWED to do</b>[by them] &hellip; They have ALLOWED this country to be overrun with 3rd world garbage. They have ALLOWED our neighborhoods and schools to be ruined &hellip; They are the ones who have ALLOWED laws to be passed that make Whites the crimminal when trying to protect themselves&hellip;.<br>
I could go on, but you get my drift. </i><br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>No need to go on!  We get your drift.  You have said it well.  I agree with you, and 11:32.<br>
Tom Iron&rsquo;s chivalry is admirable, and I respect it, but in this case it is sadly misplaced.</p>
<p>Let me go on to say that many posters here have identified this woman simply  as a &#8220;liberal&#8221; &hellip;  and thus as The Enemy.  These  far-left &#8220;liberals&#8221; spoken of have not merely  <i>&#8220;allowed&#8221;  </i>these things to happen; they have actively advanced and promoted them. And for many years now.  For them, it has been a life-long campaign.  A mission.  Their  &#8220;cause&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a former, youthful,  liberal (now wised-up, like many others here at Amren) I have to take some issue with this common terminology using the word &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s a little too loose for me.  There is a big difference between a casual liberal who hasn&rsquo;t really thought things out   &mdash;   one who has been turned out that way by the educational system, and because that seems to be what&rsquo;s expected of you and is &#8220;the thing to be&#8221; in the circles you&rsquo;re in, especially if you want to get ahead and not spend your life  bucking the system and being viewed as a  wacko, scorned as a &#8220;knuckle-dragger&#8221; and a  &#8220;Neanderthal&#8221;. [Or, heaven forbid, that most evil of things: a &#8220;racist&#8221;!]  On the other hand,  far to the left of the casual liberal, there is the intense, committed,  Marxist fanatic (such as Ms. Silver) who spends her life attacking  our society in her determination to destroy and tear down everything  that we are and which we represent.</p>
<p>In my own case, I eventually awoke to the realization - many years ago - that what they were attacking was <i>me </i>&hellip;  as well as my family, my culture, and everything that my people stood for. Why should I support those who  plainly viewed me as a enemy to be destroyed?    I came to the understanding that their fine-sounding ideals  (always cleverly expressed in lofty terms of righteousness, morality, and social justice)  were not in my interest at all, and that for me to support them would be suicidal.  End of my youthful  romance with  &#8220;liberalism&#8221;!     </p>
<p>Some of us just take longer.   It&rsquo;s hard to come to the conclusion (paranoid sounding, admittedly) that there is an undeclared race war going on &hellip;  and that WE are the brunt of it!   But when you do come to understand that, it&rsquo;s essential to recognize the enemy.  She, like Prof. Ignatief, is one of the enemy, ensconced in university positions, indoctrinating the young in self-hate and guilt, and waging their implacable war against white, western, society.  Why be nice to them?  They are not being nice to us!  Their goal is our destruction.</p>
<p>Everyone needs a chance to wake up, do some thinking and sort things out.  Hopefully, thoughtful people will do so, given time.     But this woman, at 62, a professor of anti-white studies, has had her chance. She KNOWS what she wants and what she believes in.  She is on the other side.  She is not going to change, because she is a committed enemy of our society   &mdash;    not a well meaning,  innocent, misled youth. Let&rsquo;s not confuse the two!</p>
<p>Let her reap what she has earned!   Let her learn her lesson from one of her non-white protégés.   How perfect!   It could not be a better  example of poetic justice.</p>

 I was recently reminiscing about this with an old friend  who,  with an amused chuckle, describes himself as a  former hippy (&#8220;sort of&#8221;) and a  former left-winger (&#8220;sort of&#8221;) when he went through that youthful phase (long ago).  Many of us did.   Both of us are old enough to remember the 60s and 70s when this sort of thing was &#8220;in&#8221; and de rigueur with the  <i>&#8220;in crowd&#8221;. </i>   </p>
<p> Youthful people will experiment with many ideas and they need to learn for themselves (often the hard way). We go through various phases, and it takes us time to sort things out and figure out what is really going on in the world and what life is all about. </p>
<p> I asked him just how left-wing he really was, back then.  He admitted  that he was &#8220;not very&#8221;, but that it was just  the thing to do, the thing that was expected in the campus scene that he was involved with.   Some of his girlfriends were very committed, he said, and he wanted to please them.  It was the price of sex.  All young people want to belong, to fit in, to find friends (and maybe romance), and in his crowd a right winger would have been seen as freaky.   A sore thumb.</p>
<p> He went on to a teaching career himself. He observed  (very perceptively, I thought)  that in the academic circle he knew, there were only a few REAL hippies and  REAL radicals   &mdash;   intensely committed to a cause  (including his girlfriend)   &mdash;    and then there were the vast majority of others (like him) who just went along to get along, unquestioningly,  because it seemed the thing to do.  It was simply expected.  It was the price of belonging.</p>
<p> In hindsight, an intriguing question arising out of this discussion is:  WHO sets the tone?  Who decides  what is <i><b>in  </b></i>fashion, or what is <i><b>out</b></i>?   Do these fads  just  &#8220;happen&#8221;?  Who makes them happen?</p>

			<p>Jones has made a CAREER out of promoting exactly the violence she was subjected to, as long as it was always some other white people on the receiving end, like Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome.  By using her position as a university instructor to promote violence against whites - which is exactly what the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; agenda is all about - she has been a facilitator - an enabler.  As such, she is an active enemy of the white race and the civilization it has produced, a civilization that gives idiots like Jones high-paying jobs and medical insurance, among other things.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll probably ascribe the whole incident to the poor perp having grown up &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; because of &#8220;white racism&#8221;, when in fact the guy&rsquo;s simply a creep who beats up elderly women.</p>
