<h1>Akon Claims He Doesn&rsquo;t Know His True Age</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nekesa Mumbi Moody, AP, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even though Akon has a birth certificate, he says his age is still a mystery  &mdash;  and he&rsquo;d rather keep it that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;All it&rsquo;s going to do is depress me,&#8221; he told The Associated Press in a recent interview. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to know I&rsquo;m getting older. Then I&rsquo;ll start to think about getting checkups and insurance. I don&rsquo;t want that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Numerous reports have put his age between 25 to 35 years old. In 2006, he gave his age as 25. But now, he claims his birth certificate shows he was born on April 16, 1977, which would make him 31.</p>
<p>Some have accused Akon of trying to push back his age. But the singer, who was born in the United States but spent his early life in Senegal, where his family is from, says he never knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Africa &hellip; age is not important over there. They don&rsquo;t care. People only focus on it here (America) and in Europe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Declaring your age prohibits you from claiming your welfare benefits. As long as you are underage you are entitled to a host of goodies that disappear when you are old enough to hold a job.<br>

			<p>I have noticed this among black immigrants to Canada.  When coming from countries where birth records are not kept, advantages may be gained by stating someone is younger than they really are.  </p>
<p>It may have to do with eligibility for family reunification, being able to claim child benefits longer, being older and bigger than classmates, being able to avoid adult penalties when charged with crimes, or some other deceit. </p>
<p>It is disturbing to see young black men, who appear to be in their twenties, being pulled out of high schools and charged with serious crimes as juveniles.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a black thang!  Just like time.  So now, we won&rsquo;t just be dealing with black people&rsquo;s time (always late) and black people&rsquo;s English (Ebonics), we&rsquo;ll be dealing with black people&rsquo;s ages (a guesstimate).  Sounds like black people&rsquo;s progress to me.<br>

			<p>A perfect illustration of this is the front page article in the most recent printed AR.  The innumeracy and lack of understanding of the future among African blacks is astounding.  An example from the article is that a Kenyan (?) told a white Professor that it is alien to them to describe a fruit as a fraction of how far it is up a tree.  All they know is that it&rsquo;s up there, or it&rsquo;s within reach.  No concept of halfway up, three quarters way up, and so on.</p>
<p>So, of course age in terms of numbers isn&rsquo;t that important to Africans.  My bet is that their only native concepts is roughly along the lines of infant, toddler, prepubescent child, adult, old adult.</p>

			<p>The Cubans say this same thing every year at the Little League World Series when they pass college students off as being only 14-years-old. The Asians, especially Taiwan, are known for the same trick. So, playing by the rules is mainly an American/European preoccupation.</p>

Yes indeedy! You are accurate about their lack of accuracy, Question Diversity! </p>
<p>This disregard for precision runs ALL THE WAY thru African behavior and &#8220;culture&#8221;   &mdash;   both at home and abroad. Rough guesstimates are as good as you&rsquo;re gonna get out of these people. The capacity for careful gradations, modulations, subtleties and nuances that we all TAKE FOR GRANTED from our fellow Europeans and Asians is all too often simply NOT PRESENT in blacks. </p>
<p>For instance, some of their native languages (IIRC) had words for one,&#8221; &#8220;two&#8221; and &#8220;five&#8221; but not &#8220;two&#8221; or &#8220;three.&#8221; I also recall an anecdote (might even have been here on AR) in which some white researcher was interviewing an middle-aged African chief who didn&rsquo;t know his own age, other than that he was &#8220;very old.&#8221; When the researcher pressed the chief on the question   &mdash;   insisted he put as accurate a number as he could   &mdash;   the chief thought a while then finally answered, &#8220;More than ten.&#8221; </p>
<p>As I said, this was no mere spear-carrying peon, this was a CHIEF. One of his country&rsquo;s &#8220;talented tenth,&#8221; no doubt. </p>
<p>But whatever their precise numerical age, it&rsquo;s a depressing fact that people of African descent are, to a great extent, children in adult&rsquo;s bodies. Small brains in large, muscular, hormonally hyperactive bodies: it&rsquo;s the worst imaginable combination of traits for a group to have. </p>
<p><br>
PS. I also urge everyone to click on the link to the 2003 AR article at the bottom of the Akon item, by a lawyer who deals with criminal blacks. Fascinating stuff, highly recommended! </p>

			<p>Lost in Paradise: Sports is the least of it.  Professors have told me that many of the undergrads that come over from China have in fact already graduated from Chinese universities.  They don&rsquo;t look 19, they&rsquo;re often married, and their English doesn&rsquo;t seem good enough to keep up in class unless they already knew the subject.  China wants to establish colonies in the U.S., and sending young engineers and their wives to spend four years at school to acculturate before embarking on careers as agents of the homeland is a good way to do it.  </p>

<p>Alright then,  if he&rsquo;s so scornful of these silly preoccupations that white people have, what is he doing over here instead of being over there?  He wouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with all this nonsense over there.</p>
<p>Africans DO like, however, all the nice technological inventions that white people have [what would they do without their boom boxes, TVs, and cellphones?]   &mdash;    not to mention the fruitful economies that create jobs and and produce welfare checks.  Does it not occur to them that all of these things come from our obsession with numeracy and precision?  Imagine an architect or a chemist trying to get the job done with mere guesses and approximations!  You&rsquo;d never get a man on the moon that way   &mdash;   which may explain why they haven&rsquo;t put one there. </p>
<p>Well, maybe that tells us something about the primitive condition of Africa    &mdash;    which we&rsquo;re constantly told is all the result of white oppression, racism and colonialism.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this story. So it is saying that he actually has a birth certificate, and in fact knows the year he was born (1977) but that he simply has never done the math/counting on fingers and toes to figure out how old he actually is??? </p>
<p>Well whatever. Feel good for the moment! tends to be the motto of Africa and its people. Dreary knowledge like age, HIV status, and the paternity of children is just too depressing to bother worrying about.</p>

			<p>Akon would rather focus on grinding on white women audience members, while singing &#8220;I wanna make love right now&#8221;, on the Ellen Degeneres show on national TV, like he did recently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure if I did that in any African country, I&rsquo;d either be eaten for dinner, have my head chopped off as an infidel, or asked to pay in cattle for one of those women to be my wife.</p>

			<p>Wow, lets find a flawed black male (because you will never find a flawed white one) and take every flaw and put it on blacks in general. Let&rsquo;s all get angry when one black says something offensive so we can rant on this site about how they are intellectually inferior as more and more highly intelligent white females and males began to date them and other inferior races. This will truly help us out of this economic recession or pull us out of Iaq or win Afganistan. I mean how could we go from having highly intellgent and moral presidents like Bush 41 &amp; 43, Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard &#8220;tricky dick&#8221; Nixon, LBJ etc. </p>
<p>And now we have Obama as president, who got elected through Affirmative Action (because we all know that millions of Americans and delegates voting for him more than the Mccain have nothing to do with his election) and is going to do obsured things like close down GITMO, pull us out of Iraq, guard our borders, stimulate our economy, focus on winning in Afganistan, and not listen to lobbysist. I mean this OBAMA guy is real going to harm us and reverse everthing BUSH43 did for us in 8yrs. DANG, if we could only have 8 more years of BUSH.</p>

<p>This is so true.  I work at a major university.  Student body both under and grad schools is about 70 percent Asian, both American born and foreign.  Professors tell me about Asian students who know almost no English, although to be admitted and get their student visas, they had to have passed the TOEFL  English test.  This means that they just paid a professional test taker to take the test for them.  They look 10 years older than their purported age.  Some of the School of Nursing profs think that some of the Asian students are already physicians.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the women manage to have an anchor baby during their stay in the USA.  Why would a woman in her 3rd year of medical school have a baby knowing she had to finish medical school and internship?</p>
<p>There are 2 other common Asian age scams.  </p>
<p>Young criminals often arrive with ID showing that they are under 18.  They are organized crime soldiers in the Asian mafia&rsquo;s.  They can commit murder and be tried in Juvenile Court.  </p>
<p>The other is claiming to be 10 years older.  This means that a 50 year old Asian immigrant can claim to be 60 and thus eligible for the myriad senior citizen benefits. 55 is the magical age at which disability claims are easily approved.  Younger than 55, disability claims are usually turned down the first time.  Claimants under 55 have to go through a lengthy appeals process and hire an attorney who gets 25 percent of the claim.  So it is to the immigrant&rsquo;s advantage if they have fraudulent ID showing them as  55 when they make their disability claim.</p>
<p> In my city, most, and I do mean most of the senior citizen housing has been filled with Asian immigrants while American born seniors are forced to spend most of their income on rents.<br>

<p>Logic is obviously not one of your strong points.  If you bothered to actually read the articles and posts people put on this website, you&rsquo;d know NONE of the presidents you mentioned sit well with us.  You&rsquo;d also learn better grammar and spelling.</p>
<p>In addition, you&rsquo;d learn that at no point did ANYONE ever make the claim Whites were perfect, just (as a group) mentally and morally superior to blacks.  This superiority is largely due to genetic factors.  Decades of standardized IQ tests and tabulated crime statistics from all over the world bear witness to this incontrovertible fact.</p>

<p>I might add, that at no point in history did any black people ever create anything that even remotely resembles a modern nation-state.  For better or for worse they are the sole creations of Eurasians.</p>
<p>I remember when David Dinkins (a black man) was elected the &#8220;first African-American mayor of New York&#8221;.  The leftist media greeted this news with the same hoopla it recently gave Barack HUSSEIN Obama.  After four years of this incompetent, the same idiots who voted him in couldn&rsquo;t get him out fast enough.  He was replaced with a White man (Rudy Giuliani) who, despite his flaws, proved far more competent for the job.  In spite of the fact Whites are a minority in this city, we have not had a black mayor since.</p>
<p> It will be interesting to see what shape this country will be in four years from now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wow, lets find a flawed black male (because you will never find a flawed white one) and take every flaw and put it on blacks in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that you may find upon close examination (outside your upscale white neighborhood) of black men many are like this Akon, and many more aspire to be like him and/or admire him.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Let&rsquo;s all get angry when one black says something offensive so we can rant on this site about how they are intellectually inferior as more and more highly intelligent white females and males began to date them and other inferior races.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Intellectual inferiority&#8221; as you put it, is not based on our collective anecdotal experiences, but rather on factual statistics. Look up a thing called the Intelligence Quotient, for more information.<br>
the fact that so-called &#8220;intelligent&#8221; whites interbreed is absolute bullocks. as is abundantly evident, (look at interracial marriage statistics form city to city) it is generally poorer areas that have the greatest number of interracial marriage, such poor areas that have poor educational achievement. I really don&rsquo;t think that it is the intelligent that are interbreeding, simply because there is a lack of intelligent people there to begin with. and generally, people choose mates based on other things aside from intelligence, especially with the average person.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will truly help us out of this economic recession or pull us out of Iaq or win Afganistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, yet having absurd racial policies (affirmative action) is not going to help either.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I mean how could we go from having highly intellgent and moral presidents like Bush 41 &amp; 43, Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard &ldquo;tricky dick&rdquo; Nixon, LBJ etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you are saying that a black person will make a better president simply by virtue of their skin color?</p>
<p>And now we have Obama as president, who got elected through Affirmative Action (because we all know that millions of Americans and delegates voting for him more than the Mccain have nothing to do with his election) </p>
<p>Iti s not the election process itself, it is that people often voted for him on the basis of his color, and especially white people feeling compelled to vote for him simply because of their racial guilt. </p>
<p>&#8220;and is going to do obsured things like close down GITMO, pull us out of Iraq, guard our borders, stimulate our economy, focus on winning in Afganistan, and not listen to lobbysist. I mean this OBAMA guy is real going to harm us and reverse everything BUSH43 did for us in 8yrs. DANG, if we could only have 8 more years of BUSH.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pulling out of Iraq is cowardly and sort of pointless (victory is within our grasp), guarding our borders is simply a comforting catch phrase Obama uses to appease whites (while planning to naturalize illegal immigrants to increase his voting bloc), &#8220;focusing on Afghanistan&#8221; is a recent and hypocritical excuse for retreating from Iraq, Lobbyists are among Obama&rsquo;s first priorities (just follow his social policy), and finally, being a sheep-like reactionary when it comes to Bush is pathetic.</p>
