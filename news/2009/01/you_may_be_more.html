<h1>You May Be More Racist Than You Think, Study Says</h1>

<p>A new study published Thursday in the journal Science suggests many people unconsciously harbor racist attitudes, even though they see themselves as tolerant and egalitarian.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study, and a lot of research in social psychology, suggests that there are still really a lot of negative associations with blacks,&#8221; said Kerry Kawakami, associate professor of psychology at York University in Toronto, Ontario, and lead author of the study. &#8220;People are willing to tolerate racism and not stand up against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors divided 120 non-black participants into the roles of &#8220;experiencers&#8221; and &#8220;forecasters.&#8221; The &#8220;experiencers&#8221; were placed in a room with a white person and a black person, who played out pre-arranged scenarios for the experiment. The scenarios began when the black role-player bumped the white role-player&rsquo;s knee when leaving the room.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the white person did not comment afterwards. In the &#8220;moderate&#8221; case, the white person said, &#8220;Typical, I hate it when black people do that,&#8221; after the black person left the room. In the &#8220;extreme&#8221; case, the white person remarked, &#8220;Clumsy n****r.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;forecasters,&#8221; meanwhile, predicted how they would feel in these situations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Even using that most extreme comment didn&rsquo;t lead people to be particularly upset,&#8221; said co-author Elizabeth Dunn, assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the participants were asked to choose either the black person or the white person as a partner for an anagram test. More than half of experiencers chose the white partner &mdash; regardless of the severity of the comment that person made earlier. As for the forecasters, less than half chose the white partner when a comment was made, but most chose the white person when no comment was made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regarding racism, in a famous study from the 1930s, people behaved in a non-racist manner that contradicted what they reported later. Richard LaPiere sent a Chinese couple to restaurants and hotels in the U.S., and most of these establishments accommodated them. But when LaPiere contacted the same places about whether they serve Chinese people, most said they did not.</p>
<p>More recent work by Greenwald and colleagues shows that most people &mdash; between 75 and 80 percent &mdash; have implicit, non-overt prejudices against blacks. Their Web site, Project Implicit, has a slew of tests that Web users can take to compare their self-perceptions to their underlying attitudes about people based on different social categories, such as race, age and obesity.</p>
<p>What is responsible for these attitudes? Experts say one culprit is images in television, news and film that portray blacks in a negative light.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Parents can also have a big influence, experts say. Related work by Dunn shows that if parents have positive attitudes towards blacks, and they have good relationships with their children, then the children will develop more positive attitudes towards blacks too.</p>

<p>Contemporary race relations are marked by an apparent paradox: Overt prejudice is strongly condemned, yet acts of blatant racism still frequently occur. We propose that one reason for this inconsistency is that people misunderstand how they would feel and behave after witnessing racism. The present research demonstrates that although people predicted that they would be very upset by a racist act, when people actually experienced this event they showed relatively little emotional distress. Furthermore, people overestimated the degree to which a racist comment would provoke social rejection of the racist. These findings suggest that racism may persevere in part because people who anticipate feeling upset and believe that they will take action may actually respond with indifference when faced with an act of racism.</p>

			<p>Sure&hellip;they are okay with racists. Thats just the law of averages at work. </p>
<p>Most people *should* be racist against blacks - thats just rational ignorance at work. I dont have time to start from scratch with each new person I meet, I use average black behaviour to predict what I should think of the next one I meet.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;People are willing to tolerate racism and not stand up against it.&rdquo;<br>
Just what are they calling &ldquo;racism&rdquo;. I think anyone who admits his awareness of black pathological behavior, such as hugely disproportionate violent crime, disproportionate school disruptions, illegitimacy, etc, will be considered racists by these &ldquo;researchers&rdquo;. Any natural lowering of a non-black&rsquo;s opinion of blacks as a group, because of antisocial behaviors, means that at the very least they &ldquo;have implicit, non-overt prejudices against blacks &ldquo;.  This is really anti-white psychological warfare that helps maintain by intimidation lack of discussion of this disproportionate anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>Blacks want it both ways, disproportionate antisocial behavior and yet complete pretense by whites that this is not the case. I think they should be denied this singular privilege in spite of name-calling.<br>

			<p>I may be more &#8220;racist&#8221; than I think?  Golly; having some untapped potential would be great!  I wonder if the article&rsquo;s authors have a clear idea as to how I could develop it farther; it&rsquo;d be super if I could make a good living at it.</p>

			<p> Why don&rsquo;t they ever ask the black person who they want to work with?<br>
 Pointing out the rudeness of black is only stating the obvious.<br>
I also seriously doubt that a business is going to state over the phone to a stranger, that they don&rsquo;t serve a certain ethnic group unless they looking for a lawsuit.</p>
<p> &#8221; You don&rsquo;t hate me for being a racist, you hate me because you know I&rsquo;m right&#8221;.</p>

			<p><i>A new study published Thursday in the journal Science suggests many people unconsciously harbor racist attitudes, even though they see themselves as tolerant and egalitarian.</i></p>
<p>I would include most white liberals in this category.  (To wit:  The story in AR about San Francisco about a week ago.)  And since blacks sometimes speak of themselves in the same tone that &#8220;white racists&#8221; do (I once overheard two black women say they don&rsquo;t patronize the grocery store nearest to them because it&rsquo;s got &#8216;too many n*****s,&rsquo;), and since black politicians wind up implementing most of the apartheid/segregationist system for black jurisdictions, that which they would oppose white people doing, I would include a lot of blacks in this as well.</p>
<p><i>What is responsible for these attitudes? Experts say one culprit is images in television, news and film that portray blacks in a negative light.</i></p>
<p>One out of three isn&rsquo;t bad.</p>

			<p>I am extremely postjudiced against due to 40 years of experience of working with blacks, being sexually harassed by blacks, being a victim of black on white crime and being forced to spend more than I can afford on rent just so I can live in a safe neighborhood where I can be safe from black on white crime.</p>
<p>If anyone asks, yes, I am postjudiced.</p>

			<p>This is really DANGEROUS &#8220;social science.&#8221; The social &#8216;sciences&rsquo; are not scientific if they are encumbered by political restrictions or influences of any kind or degree. Pure science must be free.</p>
<p>I am not against all psychiatry, but I think that it should not be under government control (licensing), because this means that the government is definitely in the thought-control business. Psychiatry should be, like religion, purely self-help groups, to keep freedom of thought alive.</p>
<p>Here is what Prof. Smith wrote in 1958 about the Hindu caste system (he was a liberal and not in favor of the caste system):</p>
<p>&#8220;We with our democratic sentiments do not like to admit that there are such people (i.e., followers but not leaders) by nature. The orthodox Hindu replies, What you would LIKE people to be is not the point. The question is what they ARE. (&hellip;)</p>
<p>Unless unequals are kept differentiated by some device, the weak will be matched with the strong all the way down the line and can stand no chance of winning anywhere.&#8221;<br>

			<p>A simple riposte to this wilfully-ignorant nonsense would be that judgement based upon observation of black behaviour does certainly not mean unreasoning preconceived judgement, ie. prejudice. And surely I can&rsquo;t be the only one who rolled his eyes upon reading &#8216;Experts say one culprit is images in television, news and film that portray blacks in a negative light&rsquo;, when of course all three media and entertainment outlets go out of their way to provide the public with images and impressions of black character and behaviour that are far more positive than anything we are likely to experience in actuality.</p>

			<p>The underlying metaphysical assumption of this marxist propaganda is that race doesn&rsquo;t exist and all peoples are exactly alike.  If some difference manifests itself it is because of the evil mojo of the White man.<br>
  &mdash;  -<br>
&#8220;Experts say one culprit is images in television, news and film that portray blacks in a negative light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could any sane person take this seriously?  Modern TV is an Antonio Gramsci fantasy land of propaganda.  Blacks are portrayed as anything but reflecting their reality.</p>
<p>Did any Marxist ever consider that negative stereotypes of blacks may actually stem from negative behavior by blacks?  Sociology is a pseudoscience and studies like these were constructed to achieve the results the marxist high priests wanted.  </p>

			<p>So, basically, all an &#8216;enlightened white person&rsquo; can do is to try and eliminate any negative white racist feelings he might have and build himself up to an even zero. Best case scenario. </p>
<p>The irony is, here, that not only are blacks more racist than whites, in my opinion, but, put 2 black workers in the chair, and no matter what one black person says, the other will agree. It&rsquo;s called validating another persons feelings. Perhaps these researchers might remember that? It&rsquo;s not if the slight is offensive or not, it&rsquo;s the feelings of the person in question that matter? And anyone who would try and oppress their world view, or silence these feelings, is well an oppressor. It&rsquo;s the experience of the individual that matters, and these feelings should be expressed and brought to the fore, at least, if you&rsquo;re not a white man.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;study&rdquo;? What hogwash, this is propaganda piece from anti white paid Marxists jackasses who label themselves psychologists. Notice who they are regarding as &ldquo;racists&rdquo;, white people.</p>
<p>More recent work by Greenwald and colleagues shows that most people &mdash; between 75 and 80 percent &mdash; have implicit, non-overt prejudices against blacks. Their Web site, Project Implicit, has a slew of tests that Web users can take to compare their self-perceptions to their underlying attitudes about people based on different social categories, such as race, age and obesity.</p>
<p>This statement clearly shows where these mutants are coming from; it is to measure so called prejudices against blacks. Why is there no measurement of Black racists? The answer is simple; the Black race is pure and perfect.</p>
<p>What is responsible for these attitudes? Experts say one culprit is images in television, news and film that portray blacks in a negative light.<br>
Blacks are portrayed in nothing but in a  superior position, just look at programs as &ldquo; Home Improvement&rdquo; with comedian Tim Allen. The white male is portrayed as a bumbling idiot, have you ever seen a Black shown in such a light?</p>
<p>Parents can also have a big influence, experts say. Related work by Dunn shows that if parents have positive attitudes towards blacks, and they have good relationships with their children, then the children will develop more positive attitudes towards blacks too.</p>
<p>Again these mutants are stating that it must be the white parents who must have positive attitudes towards blacks. Why do the black parents need to do, apparently nothing, after all blacks are pure and holy!<br>

			<p>The average person tolerates racism because we tolerate many things we don&rsquo;t necessarily like in people around us.</p>
<p>If &#8220;racists&#8221; were more constructive, and simply said, &#8220;Multiculturalism always fails,&#8221; I think they&rsquo;d find more people going beyond tolerance to acceptance.</p>

			<p>I think that when many of the White subjects of this experiment heard the &#8220;racist&#8221; speak, they recognized a person that they had more in common with than merely race.  Our world is a world of cognitive dissonance, where we daily hear things that are entirely at odds with the reality we see, and we know we&rsquo;ll be punished if we speak of that difference.   A racially aware White is like a beacon of sanity in this world, and other healthy Whites will naturally be drawn to him.   <br>
     The researchers know this already.  Other posters have noted what a stupid study this is, that it merely confirms something so obvious it needs no confirmation.  I suspect what they are really trying to do is collect complete psychological dossiers on as many racially healthy Whites as possible, and search those dossiers for attributes common to the racially aware.  Given enough data, statisticians can build a profile of the sort of person most likely to resist racial extermination.  This is not sci-fi, marketing people have adopted this technique and have been fine tuning it for years.  In more recent years, through MySpace and Facebook, they&rsquo;ve been able to gather an immense amount of personal information on millions of young people, which will be sold to marketeers in the near future.  Just what sort of person likes Fords better than Chevys, the color green more than the color red, and White people more than Blacks?  Given enough data, the probability of these preferences can be determined with a great deal of accuracy.  </p>

			<p>They lump everyone and everything under racist.  The fact of the matter is that the term &#8220;racist&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t apply 99% of the time it is used.  Being prejudiced or insensitive does not make one racist.<br>

			<p>It is human nature to root for the home team, hence everyone believes their race is the best.  There is nothing wrong with this perspective even though it is an illusion, because all races simply can&rsquo;t be the best.  However, only whites get demonized for feeling this way, because whites know for a fact that their race is the best&hellip;   </p>

			<p>They never did the obvious test.  Get 120 black participants.  Have a white actor say he needs to get his cell phone, leave, and bump the leg of the black actor.  Have the black actor say, &#8220;Clumsy cracker!&#8221;.  See how many of those 120 black participants choose to work with the white person rather than the black person.  I&rsquo;ll bet not more than 2 in 120.  Probably at least half would work with the black man precisely because of what he said.<br>

Elizabeth Landau complains that, &ldquo;between 75 and 80 percent &mdash; have implicit, non-overt prejudices against black&rdquo;.  But it is tragic that 20 to 25% of Americans have totally lost their survival instinct, and that so many have to sublimate their true feelings.  </p>
<p>The implicit racial prejudice fits in nicely with Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s notion of implicit and explicit whiteness. (See <a href="/archives/vol6no4/MacDonald.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://theoccidentalquarterly.com/archives/vol6no4/MacDonald.pdf</a> ) Every white person is naturally fitted with an instinct of race (extended family) consciousness and the inborn affinity for those of his race.</p>
<p>White people naturally don&rsquo;t like blacks.  It&rsquo;s true vice versa of course, but we never hear about it. The antagonism between races is a fact of life.  Living your life pretending otherwise is being false to one&rsquo;s self and brings on an identify crisis.  It is becoming more and more difficult for white people to be true to their selves.  White people live their lives filled with anxiety because they worry about committing a racist&rsquo;s act.  There are no ordered set rules of what is offensive to blacks.  Who could have guessed that a lasso would morph into a full blown racist act?<br>

Generations of whites have been turned into neurotics fearing they may be a racist. Where is Erik Erikson when you really need him?</p>
<p>In America backs are free to express their dislike of white people.  The daily year in and year out anti-white propaganda that swaps America has a positive affect on blacks and a negative affect on whites.</p>
<p>Blacks are free to live their freedom.  Not so with white people.  White people know they are free to choose to be white and live an explicit white life.  But many give in to the powerful force of Political Correctness.   But they choose to take on the role of anti-whiteness out of fear of PC, rationalizing that they will lose their jobs, hurt their families, hurt others feelings, or become an outcast. </p>
<p>Because a person knows that he should choose to be white, yet he chooses to lives as a non-white, he has by so choosing made the non-white his being.  His being is grounded in the not-ness of his not-whiteness, or in no-thing-ness.  To be truly a whole person, integral, an authentic being one must ground his life in being, not in its negation, nothingness.  He has his choice of Being or Nothingness.  His convincing himself that he is not free to live authentically is bad faith.   </p>
<p>Yes had Jean-Paul Sartre lived he would have been not a Marxists but a Race Realists.</p>

			<p>I wonder what the result would have been had the behaviours been reversed (ie, white role player bumping black role player&rsquo;s knee and negative comments from black role player). What if the scenario was tested using all possible permutations of race (eg, asians, blacks, white, hispanics? as the role players? </p>

			<p>Walter Lewkowski at 3:14 AM: Thanks for the link to Kevin McDonald.  The article says, yes, Whites have a natural preference for our own people, but Whites also have that trait to a lesser degree than other, more collectivist races.  That is, our tolerance is used as a weapon against us.  <br>
     It&rsquo;s a long, academic article, with more than I cared to know about brain scans, but I encourage everyone to read it.  It addresses other topics of interest, such as NASCAR-gun-country music-White culture, and why the White elites have turned against their own people.  </p>

			<p>The poster who remarked that these Marxist controlled studies are dangerous, is quite correct.  That is, of course, because such studies comprise yet another relentless series of Marxist derived persecution methodologies with which to attempt to grind white people across the world further and further into the gutter by attempting firstly to dispossess them of their lands and then disenfranchising them of the right to rule their own lands, to preserve their own heritages, languages, belief systems, histories and cultures, and secondly and finally, to deprive them of the means of livelihood by which to survive and propagate.</p>
<p>The following are various headlines from the printed media and the titles apportioned by the editors of each to <i>the same news item</i>, must be noted because they are extremely telling.</p>

<p>Furthermore, on every one of these types of supposed studies, either the lead anti-white race-hate instigator (please note: the new title for race-hate instigator is now &#8216;professor&rsquo;), is a non-white with a couple of self-loathing white Marxist Liberal subordinates thrown in for good measure as a means of trying to avoid allegations of being a non-white race-hate instigator with an anti-white racist agenda or is an actual self-loathing white Marxist instigator with a couple of non-white assistants thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Increasingly these days, it&rsquo;s non-white academics who are the originators of such studies.</p>
<p>What white academics across the world must start embarking on are studies of non-white racism against white peoples, ignoring the propaganda nonsense that maintains that non-whites can&rsquo;t be racist because they belong to oppressed groups.   </p>
<p><b>Another study, but this time on the topic of non-white interracial racism, needs to be carried out and headed strictly by white academics who are not themselves brainwashed by any aspect of self-loathing Marxist ideology.</b></p>

			<p>&ldquo;This study, and a lot of research in social psychology, suggests that there are still really a lot of negative associations with blacks&#8221;</p>
<p>True, but that does not mean that the negative associations are FALSE either!</p>
<p>Usually when I am called a racist [either directly or indirectly which I am now on almost a daily basis], I usually respond by asking what the person means by the term &#8220;racist&#8221;. Then, I tend to agree with his, her, or their representations [to the acute chagrin of my accuser(s)I might add]. </p>
<p>When they take the predicable, pompous, condescending attitude, I might just ask them which neighborhood THEY would feel the most comfortable walking through, alone, at 2:00 A.M. on any given Saturday morning - a totally white area OR a totally black area. Even the blacks typically wouldn&rsquo;t prefer walking through an unfamiliar all black area. Hmmmm The truth hurts doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

Main Entry: rac·ism  <br>
Pronunciation: \ˈrā-ˌsi-zəm also -ˌshi-\ <br>
Function: noun <br>
Date: 1933 <br>
1 : &#8220;a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race&#8221;</p>
<p>By every conceivable measure of human accomplishment known to man it is obvious that the white race is superior.  Substitute the word &#8220;belief&#8221; with the word &#8220;fact&#8221;, because history validates this &#8220;fact&#8221;.  The word &#8220;racism&#8221; was coined in 1933 by Marxist academia to use as a weapon against whites and nothing more&hellip;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Generations of whites have been turned into neurotics fearing they may be a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same goes for blacks&hellip;it is called the hate whitey syndrom. Blacks have been brainwashed to think that white skin=Racist. The figment of somebody&rsquo;s imagination is turning us all into lunatics.<br>
