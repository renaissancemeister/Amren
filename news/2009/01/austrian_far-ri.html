			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DPA, Earth Times, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Austrian far-right parliamentarian Susanne Winter was convicted Thursday of incitement because of her anti-Muslim statements, including the claim that Islam&rsquo;s prophet Mohammed was a paedophile. A court in Winter&rsquo;s home town of Graz also found the 51-year-old politician guilty of humiliating a religion. She was sentenced to a fine of 24,000 euros (31,000 dollars) euros and a suspended prison term of three months, Austrian news agency APA reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She also proposed in a discussion with students that Muslim men should commit bestiality rather than making &#8220;indecent advances&#8221; on girls.</p>
<p>The politician had pleaded innocent Thursday, claiming that she &#8220;did not want to insult anyone, but only to point out problems.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mohammed humiliated his religion by marrying and consummating his marriage to a little girl on her ninth birthday.  If all the world learned the Muslims worship a pedophile prophet and it failed to humiliate Islam, nothing would.  It is our job to spread the word&hellip;   </p>

			<p>I recall being in Vienna a few years ago. I&rsquo;m Jewish so I decided to visit a very old Moorish synagogue truly a masterpiece I needed to give 4 forms of ID in order to get in, why not because of &#8220;neo-Nazis&#8221; but because of Turks, Arabs and other Muslims. I tell you I as a Jew would vote Joerg Haider anyday after this.</p>

			<p>So this is what the white Europeans&rsquo; vaunted social democracies come down to: keep your mouth shut, your head down, and your taxes paid up.  Don&rsquo;t speak your mind or the truth, or you might go to jail.  No wonder white people in Europe don&rsquo;t seem to want to save themselves and their institutions from Third World encroachment.</p>

			<p>Any man who has sex with pre-pubescent girls is a pedophile.  If I remember my Koranic studies : ), Mohammed fits the bill.  Is even truth not a defense?  Not in the New World of Diversity.</p>

			<p>What in Gods name are the prosecutors thinking? <br>
Now insulting someone or some group is a CRIME!!!!!!!!!! <br>
What exactly is an insult? If one LOOKS at some one with a scowl on their face, is THAT going to be a CRIME?!!!!<br>
Is a Judge in a trial INSULTING a defendant who has been found guilty by calling them guilty?? Wouldn&rsquo;t the Judge then be guilty of a CRIME??<br>
I sometimes think that there must be some sort of virus which causes paralyzes of reasoning that has infected a large majority of the Europeans. (Not to mention American Liberals)<br>
To me they seem really quite mad.<br>
Although I am not a Doctor, I would still prescribe them a healthy dose of Amren articles for a possible cure of their mental afflictions. <br>

			<p>She deserves an award for thinking in this way. Liberals cry out loud for freedom of speech, except for when it involves something that they don&rsquo;t like.</p>

			<p>So the real question is when are these Kangaroo Kourts coming to America?  The concept of Western Civilization is based around the ideals of freedom of speech, but I guess since it has been decided that the West should commit suicide it&rsquo;s best to get rid of silly things like freedom of speech.  The governments of the west let moslems into their countries and let them have free reign to incite violence and advocate the murder of non moslems, yet a native born person faces jail for suggesting that moslem men shouldn&rsquo;t rape girls.   </p>

			<p>A woman I knew years ago had a friend who lived in the mideast for a while and told her that women were for breeding and boys were for pleasure. And a Jordanian muslim told us that they breed their wives through a hole in a sheet. These people just ain&rsquo;t right.  I remember these things when I see pictures of muslim men in big bunches with boys.   </p>

			<p>The solution is to FIGHT SMART. There are hundreds of different tactics that can be used to expose, humiliate and defeat the Elitists and their snarling dogs in the media. One succesful tactic used against the dictator Milosovich was used by activist youth; they would secretly spray paint suggestive slogans on bridges, walls, etc, like, &#8220;Change is Coming&#8221; or &#8220;He won&rsquo;t last long&#8221;. Everyone knew who they were talking about. It educated and inspired the masses. <br>
Similarly, the Islamists and their treasonous protectors can be ridiculed. How about verses direct from the Koran and Hadith, with page numbers, spray painted on majory over passes and walls. No other comment, just the FACTS. Let the Koran desecrate ITSELF. No comment is even neccesary. Hell, for all they would know, someone put it up there because they LOVE the Koran! <br>
Similarly, stickers with the truth can be stuck inside phone booths, restrooms, subway walls, bus stations&hellip;leaflets can left in magazines in doctors waiting rooms&hellip;tucked inside library books&hellip;you get the idea. <br>
The Elites and the Media ARE the ENEMY. Fight smart&hellip;or lose everything. </p>

			<p>So much for freedom in Austria. By the way, the &#8220;prophet&#8221; was a fraud and a pedophile. Having sexual relations with a nine year old girl should make muslims ashamed, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>If I may say off topic a tad, the Austrians and Germans are not quite what they used to be, in a collective manner of speaking. The two World Wars killed off some of the best and most noble blood and the remaining hence has a hard time. I know some girls my age and some boys from over in Osterreich (i&rsquo;m teenaged) and they act MORE American than I do. I&rsquo;d be worried. We are far from dawn, if the day will ever come.</p>

			<p>There are two issues here, neither of which was picked up in commentary.  The first is that the Muslims simply do not belong in Austria.  The Turks immigrating to Austria are not wanted, and culturally incompatible with the Austrians.  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter whether their prophet was a pedophile or not.  The second issue is that the Austrian government is violating citizens natural right to freedom of speech by enacting and enforcing spurious incitement codes.  </p>
<p>As with the rest of the Western world, marxist governments are destroying their host countries civilizations.</p>

No argument here.  Not meaning to defend him, but solely by way of explanation, let me say that in that part of the world   &mdash;   and especially in that time   &mdash;   people there aged fast; and life was nasty, vicious and brief.  This was the culture that produced Islam. And the culture that still rules it today.</p>
<p>I remember reading in a book about Arabia/Yemen/Ethiopia that a woman of twenty-five was considered a hag.  And by thirty, she was probably dead.</p>

			<p>  It&rsquo;s strange how the European states bend over backward to protect Islam, but don&rsquo;t really care about the well established religions of their respected citizens. God knows with so much trouble coming out of the Middle East, I see dark days ahead for much of Europe due to Muslim extremism. Curtailment of freedom of speech seems de rigueur, and excuses for brutal religious violence by Muslim Immigrants by the left is very common.  </p>

Johnny English</p>
<p>Good point, Johnny.  Having children while young is similar to having many children, because the generations come closer together.</p>
<p>Of course, our Third World demographic rivals hit the jackpot both ways  - they start having children while young (usually very young), AND they have many of them!</p>
