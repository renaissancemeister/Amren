			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael A. Fletcher, Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Throughout his barrier-breaking presidential campaign, Barack Obama avoided calling direct attention to race, long a divisive force in electoral politics. But now, as he stands on the verge of becoming the nation&rsquo;s first African American president, Obama is talking more about how his racial identity can unify and transform the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an entire generation that will grow up taking for granted that the highest office in the land is filled by an African American,&#8221; Obama said in an interview last week with The Washington Post. &#8220;I mean, that&rsquo;s a radical thing. It changes how black children look at themselves. It also changes how white children look at black children. And I wouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the force of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the symbolism of his historic achievement, Obama said, he hopes to use his presidency as an example of how people can bridge differences  &mdash;  racial and otherwise. &#8220;What I hope to model is a way of interacting with people who aren&rsquo;t like you and don&rsquo;t agree with you that changes the temper of our politics,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And then part of that changes how we think about moving forward on race relations. Race relations becomes a subset of a larger problem in our society, which is we have a diverse, complicated society where people have a lot of different viewpoints.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Obama is sworn in tomorrow, many Americans will celebrate a once-unthinkable milestone achieved by a politician whose own mixed racial heritage  &mdash;  he is the product of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother  &mdash;  raised piercing questions of identity as he began his quest for the presidency. Is he black enough? some asked in his campaign&rsquo;s early days. Did his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia make him too different to fully appreciate America&rsquo;s painful struggle for civil rights and racial progress that laid the foundation for his ascendancy?</p>
<p>Obama has confronted questions about his racial identity since his earliest days in politics. And now he is confronting new questions, as Americans of differing backgrounds are eager to claim him. Is he the first black president or the first biracial president? Why should the white part of his lineage give way to the black part?</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not elect our first African American president. Rather, we elected our first biracial president,&#8221; Douglas Snyder of Bowie wrote in a letter published Saturday in The Post.</p>
<p>For his part, Obama is unambiguous in calling himself an African American, the identity he embraced early on.</p>
<p>Though he has always honored his white mother and grandparents, the young Obama read African American writers and studied the mien of the black guys he encountered on the basketball court. He was intrigued by the older African American men who played cards with his grandfather. He imitated the dance moves he saw on the television show &#8220;Soul Train,&#8221; and he tried to curse like the late comedian Richard Pryor.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s style, his habits, his sensibilities, some scholars say, will create a new White House iconography.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very fact that he is black means that we&rsquo;re going to be transforming the aesthetic of the American democracy,&#8221; said Peniel E. Joseph, a presidential historian and professor of African American studies at Brandeis University. &#8220;Virtually every single thing that he will do from this point on is uncharted territory. His choice of a church. The State of the Union. News conferences. Those all become new.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black-oriented Ebony magazine used a cover photo of Obama emerging from his SUV in a dark suit and black shades to celebrate him as an exemplar of &#8220;black cool.&#8221; His fondness for pickup basketball is well chronicled. And even his friends have commented on how his loping stride gave him a look of confidence as the cameras caught him walking the White House colonnade during his first post-election visit with President Bush.</p>

			<p>BHO is a fraud, an imposter, a liar. That &#8220;a generation will grow up taking for granted that the highest office in the land is filled by an African America&#8221; is horrific, not least because he&rsquo;s Constitutionally ineligible. This entire election has been a God-forsaken farce and yet everyone is allowing it to happen, save for a few who have the courage to submit lawsuits that question his legitimacy. Everyone else is afraid of triggering racial mayhem should they question anything about this usurper.</p>
<p>The USA that we knew has ceased to exist, and we have hit the bottom of the bottomless pit.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, Obama (and the rest of the USA&rsquo;s) decision to see him as African-American, rather than bi-racial or half-black, half-white signifies one thing that we all know: it is much more advantageous in todays America to be seen as black than as white.  It is merely easier to climb the ladder of opportunity and gain sympathy through the melodrama of black victimization.  That is why Obama is &#8220;black&#8221; and not &#8220;bi-racial&#8221;</p>

			<p>I would have been impressed if Obama had made no big deal of things and said that he was just another elected president, preparing to take the oath and assuming his duties.  Instead, he is latching onto every predictable cliche and historical issue he can, making this inaguation 100% about race.  It resembles a coronation rather than a swearing in ceremony.  He is clever, because with all this hype and the assertion of ownership he hopes to be building political capital out of nothing.  I wonder how long it will be until opposing him will be illegal as a &#8220;hate crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I am certain that we are in for a four year long Black History Month.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I mean, that&rsquo;s a radical thing. It changes how black children look at themselves. It also changes how white children look at black children. And I wouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the force of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would.  What happens when blacks still fail to rise to the occassion and score so low on tests and still need AA appointments and grading to graduate from college?</p>
<p>And what kind of impression do white kids get from black talking heads who consistently whine about not having a level playing field when the kids are smart enough to realize the utter untruth of such bellyaching, because they are fully aware of how much privilege blacks are accorded, up close and personal in the real world?</p>
<p>The mistake this creep is making is the same one all white liberals make as well, which is that the only thing blacks need to excel are role models.</p>
<p>Granted the black image will be enhanced by having a black president, but to expect a radical improvement in the black population is pure folly.  Putting even more unqualifed blacks in positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for, aceing out a white in order to do that, is going to create tremendous resentment and well it should.</p>
<p>Having a half-black president in office, with a wife that spouts unintelligent remarks constantly just might not work to black adavantage even so far as image is concerned if Obama screws up big time during his tenure, which is what I&rsquo;m expecting to happen.</p>
<p>Plus, I expect the economy to tank big time.  It&rsquo;s not possible to substitue high sounding phrases for prosperity when the system has finally broken down and can&rsquo;t be fixed.</p>

			<p>Most of us in Illinois who have at least a semblance of a brain have known from Day One that Obama wears his color on his sleeve as deeply stitched as possible.</p>
<p>He may have fooled millions elsewhere but not many of us conservatives in this corrupt black racist state of Illinois.</p>

			<p><i>Though he has always honored his white mother and grandparents</i></p>
<p>How much of the Kool-Aid did this leftist writer drink anyway? We&rsquo;re talking about the Obama, let&rsquo;s not forget, who threw his grandmother &#8220;under the bus&#8221; when he as much as called her a &#8220;racist&#8221; on national television. Obama needn&rsquo;t do anything for four years when he has such a shameless cheering section as the national media.</p>

			<p>Here in South Africa we&rsquo;ve had black presidents since 1994, when the sainted Nelson Mandela broke that barrier. South Africa also abolished slavery 25 years before the USA did. Very progressive, we are.</p>
<p>I must say, it didn&rsquo;t work out too well for us.  Maybe you&rsquo;ll have better luck, but I can&rsquo;t think of a single reason why you would.  Welcome to my world.  The third world.</p>

			<p>Obama is about as &#8220;post-racial&#8221; as Michael King, Al Sharpton, and Je$$e &#8220;Action&#8221; Jackson, all rolled into one.  The inauguration has been portrayed by the media exactly as it is   &mdash;   a transfer of power from the Whites that carved out a civilization on this continent to the non-Whites who took over in sheer numbers.  I am horrified today, for myself, but moreso for my children.  We have sentenced our children to live in a post-racial America, i.e. a multi-racial peddler&rsquo;s market.  Whites aren&rsquo;t skilled peddlers, and therein lies the rub.</p>

			<p>As an outside observer and having a lifetime of experince handlig/managing popel, only mutual respcet for each other will cahnge te situtaion.  If other races (as groups) do not work to educate themselves and ear the same social respect as many whites have, then to woide gulf between te races will always be there until they do.  After 50 years of affirmative action for the African Americans where it would appear they have not taken advantage of the privilege as a group, we should all worry about the future for we have a similar situation here in Europe although some countries use better judgment than others in Europe.   the problem as i se it is that thsoe who do not have constant contact with the lower calsses of blacks do not undersatnd and think thsoe that have and expect what many of them do (violent crime, drug-dealers and users, multiple baby makers, social financial benefit receivers, etc.) are racist,  God how I hate that word used when only the truth is being revealed.  </p>

			<p>I totally agree that President BO will &#8220;be transforming the aesthetic of the American [style] democracy.&rdquo; The election was a clear signal that ethnonationalism is, (and always has been) the crucial force of politics.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s George fanning writing for the BNP:</p>
<p>&hellip;Media coverage in the wake of Barak Obama&rsquo;s election victory sought to give the impression that he had been propelled to the Presidency, almost by united acclamation of the entire American electorate.  A psephological analysis indicates that the truth is rather different.   In spite of all Bush&rsquo;s patent failures, white Americans still voted Republican last November by clear margin of 55% to 43%, which would have been enough to put John McCain in the White House, if America still had the same population balance as it did 30 years ago.   A more startling statistic is that black voters supported Obama by a margin of 95% to 5% and Hispanics by 66% to 31%.   Far from demonstrating that race is no longer a factor in US politics, the Obama victory actually proved the pre-eminence of ethnic affiliation as an influence on voting patterns.  Indeed, it showed that the decline of white America has now made it possible for the first time to build a Hispanic/black-led coalition capable of seizing the reigns of power.  Whereas whites were divided during the presidential election, blacks were unified in their common purpose of electing their ethnic champion.  The Obama victory is certainly historic, for it surely marks the beginning of the end of the USA as a predominantly white, ethnic-European country&hellip;</p>

			<p>Blacks always put up a reassuring, educated front when they&rsquo;re running for office or interviewing for a job, but once they get in, they start bringing in all their friends and relatives, hiring other blacks and &#8220;people of color&#8221; and squeezing out whitey whenever they can. Despite all his &#8220;post-racial&#8221; rhetoric, Obama will pack the government with as many blacks as he can, but I don&rsquo;t think he can do a lot of damage there because the Federal government is already an affirmative-action reservation. Washington DC has been a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; for decades and it&rsquo;s going to get a lot darker over the next several years, but the real problem with the Obama Regime is going to be his effect on the economy. None of these people have a clue about what&rsquo;s going on and they&rsquo;re going to turn a one-or-two-year recession into a ten-year depression, trashing the currency in the process. Personally, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to convert my savings into foreign currency and precious metals before it gets wiped out. Meanwhile, I predict Obama will gradually morph into your standard &#8220;Big Chief&#8221; over the next several years. We&rsquo;re already seeing the first signs of it with the SUVs, black suits and black shades, not to mention his $150 million inauguration. </p>

			<p>Barack Obama didn&rsquo;t need to call attention to his race, this country is not filled with blind people, Obama is black. </p>
<p>If I were running for president I could try to explain to Native Americans that I have a small amount of Native blood because you sure as heck can&rsquo;t see it but Obama didn&rsquo;t need to draw attention to the fact that he&rsquo;s black. </p>
<p>I once went to visit the family of a friend&rsquo;s girl friend and when we got there I noticed that part of the family was a little on the dark side. Both of the parents appeared to be white but some of the children had an unmistakable shading of black. These people would surely have an identity crisis. I really don&rsquo;t see this where Obama is concerned, he couldn&rsquo;t even pass as &#8220;high yellow&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;It changes how black children look at themselves. It also changes how white children look at black children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first may be true.  The second is not.  The behavior of black children will determine how white children look at them.</p>

			<p>Wow, with comments like this do still wonder why so many blacks feel the need for Affirmative Action. First, more people other than blacks have benefitted from Affirmative Action esp white women.</p>
<p>Secondly, I love how people on here agree with ever single black sterotype out there and site pass experiences as an example as if blacks have none. You get so angry at the fact that main stream America is not telling the whole truth yet this site use mainstream media as it&rsquo;s source to keep you updated on race.</p>
<p>Finally, many people site the problems of minorities as if whites themselves have none. Like all white leaders are good and don&rsquo;t have never had a questionable past. If look at the past you see some leaders aren&rsquo;t as nice as they seem in history books.</p>
<p>No matter what is said on this website nothing will change the fact that your president is Black.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never believed Barack Obama was post-racial, not least because he seems obsessed with the topic in his autobiography, which I read parts of at the local bookstore (not buying it though).</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the book was written quite well overall, but in the chapter on race Obama presented views which, in my opinion, were alarmingly puerile. I would have hoped that a man who is now president would not mark up every perceived slight against him to evil whitey&rsquo;s racism, but he does, so, so predictably.</p>

			<p>In Australia, they view the Obama phenomena as a testament that the child of an immigrant has the opportunity to become the President in one generation.  We see the world from our own tinted glasses.  <br/>
Others may note that his character is, without debate, a function of his mother and grandmother&rsquo;s influence.  His father was not there after the age of two.  <br/>
The main stream media is too focused on race and not the content of character.  They could do us all a favor by being less racist in their views.<br/>

			<p>Obama, like every black, is race-obsessed.  It&rsquo;s a form of mental illness.  If I woke up every day and talked about the Eskimo Conspiracy and how the Eskimos were ruining my life, eventually my friends and family would have me committed to an institution.  The same should hold true for blacks, but somehow they get a pass on their neurosis.</p>

			<p>Rational Thinker, BHO is a *usurper*. He is a foreign-born individual with dual citizenship; something that our brilliant Founders forbade. Do you know why he&rsquo;s been given a pass by everyone? Mainly out of fear of widespread racial srife. BHO has zero right to be in OUR Oval Office, and we are going to continue to call him on it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Rational thinker.&#8221; Judging by your screen name, you seem to think you&rsquo;re more rational than we are  &mdash;  more enlightened  &mdash;  but you&rsquo;re really just demonstrating that you think the same way everybody else thinks. In other words, you&rsquo;re just another politically-correct conformist who doesn&rsquo;t have an opinion which hasn&rsquo;t been pre-approved by the High Commissars of Diversity and Multiculturalism. Needless to say, ignoring reality doesn&rsquo;t make you more rational. It just means that you&rsquo;ve been thoroughly indoctrinated. I was going to try to respond to your various points, but I couldn&rsquo;t understand what you were saying half the time and the rest of it was just the usual collection of Straw Horse arguments that prove you don&rsquo;t have the slightest idea what we think about anything. For example, no one here has ever said that whites didn&rsquo;t have problems or that &#8220;all white leaders are good.&#8221; Just the opposite in fact. And where did you get this idea that history books present leaders as &#8220;nice?&#8221; That&rsquo;s seriously bizarre. If you&rsquo;re talking about the late-great USA&rsquo;s mythologized version of its own history as presented in schools fifty years ago, the Social Marxists have been working overtime to erase that &#8220;nice&#8221; history for decades now. Besides, who said we ever believed it in the first place? You won&rsquo;t find a lot of fans of Abraham Lincoln here, for instance. As for the rest of your post, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what &#8220;site pass experiences as an example as if blacks have none&#8221; is supposed to mean or where you got the idea that we&rsquo;re angry because &#8220;the main stream America is not telling the whole truth.&#8221; Of course it isn&rsquo;t telling the truth. Why do you think sites like this exist in the first place?</p>

<p>Actually in America he&rsquo;s black. The only time a mixed raced black is considered bi racial (esp. people like you) is when he is doing something GOOD or has accomplished something out of the stereotype. If he was a racist serial killer people on here would considered him as black as ever.</p>
<p>If we were not going to be considered black then in that case the black prison population would drop by about 20%. But people like you wouldn&rsquo;t be down with that would you.</p>
<p>As I said before, you now have a BLACK president leading your country. Nothing said on here can change that. :)</p>

<p>What i mean by &#8220;site past experiences as if blacks have none&#8221; is many people on here will give past experiences with blacks as proof they are stupid, dumb, inferior, or any other sterotype. But when blacks do it they are called racist, dumb, and completely lack all understanding of whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The only time a mixed raced black is considered bi racial (esp. people like you) is when he is doing something GOOD or has accomplished something out of the stereotype.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong again. It&rsquo;s an OBSERVATION that the more intelligent and successful blacks tend to be of mixed-race, an OBSERVATION, not some mindless prejudice. Accomplished blacks are more likely to be of mixed-race. More likely. That&rsquo;s a generalization based on a large number of specific examples. It&rsquo;s called logical induction. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the generalization. You keep talking about stereotypes as if stereotypes are automatically wrong by definition. Stereotypes are generalizations based on experience and in the case of blacks, the stereotype is well deserved.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s half-white, half-black, and it&rsquo;s lucky for us he is. He&rsquo;s going to be a disaster, but we&rsquo;d really be screwed if we had a Marion Barry type sitting in the Oval Office. In my experience, blacks tend to screw up everything they touch when they get into positions of power and the blacker they are, the worse it gets. Again, that&rsquo;s an OBSERVATION based on experience, not some prejudice I cooked up to make myself feel better about living in a double-wide trailer. In any case, Obama sees himself as black and blacks see him as black, so this idea that his &#8220;blackness&#8221; was imposed on him by a bunch of white racists is completely ridiculous and just another disguised piece of Victim Theology.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were not going to be considered black then in that case the black prison population would drop by about 20%. But people like you wouldn&rsquo;t be down with that would you.&#8221;</p>
<p>People like me wouldn&rsquo;t be down with releasing blacks from prison because ninety-nine percent of them belong there regardless of their racial classification.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;you now have a BLACK president leading your country. Nothing said on here can change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And nothing can change the fact that blacks have a history now. If this was 1950, it would be a different matter, but this is 2008 and we&rsquo;ve had a half-century to get a good look at the content of the black character. Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; have an almost unbroken record of incompetence and corruption and we&rsquo;re worried that Obama&rsquo;s going to do to the US what Kwame Kilpatrick did to Detroit or Marion Barry did to Washington DC. Obama may not be full of irrational hostility towards whites, but his disciples seem to be and they think they&rsquo;ve &#8220;taken over the country.&#8221; The mindless adulation of the Obama cult reminds me of something you&rsquo;d see in China under Mao or the old Soviet Union. It&rsquo;s a Cult of Personality based on race with a barely concealed hatred of Western Civilization in general and white males in particular. Bush was bad enough, but Obama&rsquo;s going to be even worse. A black president with a Messiah complex surrounded by Clintonistas, neo-liberals, socialists and agents of foreign influence. That&rsquo;s bad news if you ask me.</p>

			<p>Obama is indeed an African-American, as he is the offspring of an African father and American mother, regardless of their respective races. He is, however, only half black.</p>
