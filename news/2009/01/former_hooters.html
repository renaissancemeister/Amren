<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Hooters girl who says she&rsquo;s got the right assets  &mdash;  but the wrong accent  &mdash;  is suing the Hawaiian Tropic Zone for crushing her dream of working as one of its bikini-clad beauties.</p>
<p>Melody Morales said she was rejected for a job by a manager at the Times Square restaurant who griped, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t speak white&#8221; and &#8220;you are ghetto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Latina lovely is the latest woman to sue over working conditions at the Hawaiian Tropic Zone, where employees in skimpy beachwear parade nightly before diners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit says Morales went with her mother to the restaurant last March in search of a job. It claims a manager told her to get lost, saying, &#8220;I am not going to ruin my business with your Latin accent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morales, who said her dream job is to pour drinks while strutting her stuff in a bikini, returned to the Hawaiian Tropic Zone months later still in pursuit of a position.</p>
<p>Her suits says another manager instantly rejected her, telling her, &#8220;We will not hire you because you have a speech problem,&#8221; and &#8220;You have a Latin accent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They never even looked at me in a bikini,&#8221; [Morales] whimpered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The restaurant that bills itself as &#8220;The Hottest Place on Earth&#8221; is facing a $600 million federal suit from four former female workers accusing an ex-boss of sickening sexual antics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe everything they&rsquo;re saying,&#8221; Morales said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Morales said the place has no room for someone with her accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they want their girls to speak white,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m guessing her &#8220;speech problem&#8221; involved using trashy street slang and the inability to complete a sentence without a great deal of profanity involved. In these litigious times, no employer in their right mind would tell a job applicant that they weren&rsquo;t being considered because they had a latin accent.</p>

			<p>Judging by the way she looks (make-up and such), I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the guy was right. She probably does &#8220;talk ghetto.&#8221; Having an accent is one thing, but when you can not properly formulate sentences and make-up words that sound &#8220;Gangsta&#8221; you are NOT getting a job from me.</p>

			<p>Who said &#8220;speak White&#8221; first?  It sounds as if the manager did first.  Whoever did, it is a reflection of deteriorating education and intelligence in our population.  This dialogue sounds as if it was taken right out of a &#8220;Bevis and Butthead&#8221; episode.  As for the woman herself, her photo - she may have &#8220;assets&#8221; but her face is not attractive to me in the least.  There is no trace of cognance in that face.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not her latin accent, but her lower NYC accent. There are plenty of latinas already employed there. <br/>
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with her figure, at least the front. I wonder if there&rsquo;s a &#8220;tramp stamp&#8221; on the backside.</p>
<p>Perhaps Melody Morales can try her luck in places such as Mexico and Puerto Rico, where they can legally require female job applicants to submit a recent photograph with their resumes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that bikini picture will land her several interviews.</p>

			<p>   well, I am a 270 pound, 54 yr. old balding white guy. I think I&rsquo;ll sue somebody for millions of dollars because I want to be a bikini model. Makes as much sense as she does. Hell, maybe I want to serve drinks while trying to stuff myself in a two-man tent that I&rsquo;ll call a bikini. And I may be one up on her, I speak &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>

			<p>She definitely has a &#8220;ghetto&#8221; Hispanic look. Her face is unattractive as well. I don&rsquo;t say that because she is Hispanic, but because it is the truth. There are many beautiful Hispanic women, but usually they are the light-skinned Spanish type. Turn your TV to any Spanish channel and you will see what I mean. I highly recommend watching any &#8220;Miss Venezuela&#8221; or &#8220;Miss Colombia&#8221; beauty pagaent if you want to see a beautiful woman. </p>

As I always remind AR readers   &mdash;   not that most of us need much reminding, but just in case   &mdash;   that when reading MSM stories about race you must ALWAYS take into account that the journalist will be using every &#8220;legal,&#8221; &#8220;ethical&#8221; trick in the book to stack the deck against white people. </p>
<p>Especially when the writer of the story has a name like Jose Martinez. </p>
<p>Let me show you what I mean: </p>
<p>The restaurant in question is in Manhattan, in the middle of New York City, a heavily liberal area that was enforcing PC speech codes before most of the rest of the country even became aware of the concept. The idea that a restaurant manager in Manhattan in 2009   &mdash;   following decades of PC indoctrination and only two months after the election of a black president   &mdash;   would say those things IN THOSE WORDS is very VERY hard for me to believe. The restaurant&rsquo;s manager is ALMOST CERTAINLY being paraphrased here   &mdash;   paraphrased to make him sound more mean, more &#8220;RACIST&#8221; to this girl than he really was. </p>
<p>Did the manager indicate to this Morales girl that her accent was too thick? Possibly he said something along those lines. Did he do it with the words &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak white&rdquo; and &ldquo;you are ghetto&rdquo;? </p>
<p>Did he really say, verbatim, &ldquo;We will not hire you because you have a speech problem,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You have a Latin accent&rdquo;? </p>
<p>And did he actually utter the words, &ldquo;I am not going to ruin my business with your Latin accent&rdquo;? </p>
<p>Or is that just the way the disgruntled would-be employee REMEMBERS it? </p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t there   &mdash;   but I very much doubt ANY of those things were said as bluntly as that. </p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s my point: Senor Martinez wasn&rsquo;t there either! What we are getting is only Senorita Morales&rsquo; version of the events, after the fact, and (most important) in HER words. </p>
<p>When a journalist is faced with a situation like this, it is EXPECTED of him to go get both sides of the story. It is ALSO expected of him to question the claimant on the EXACT wording that was used: to get every syllable as accurate as possible. And if you CAN&rsquo;T be certain that your subject is giving you the correct wording, then you must indicate to the reader that these statements are NOT verbatim; e.g., &#8220;The manager said things that seemed to suggest that&hellip;&#8221;; &#8220;He said something to the effect of&hellip;&#8221;; and so on.  </p>
<p>Incorrectly quoting somebody in a newspaper can be as damaging to them as someone falsely testifying against them in a court of law. Words matter because they have consequences   &mdash;   sometimes SERIOUS consequences. </p>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter when you have a sympathetic journalist from your own grievance group, who&rsquo;s convinced his editor that this story will give the Daily News a chance to (yet again!) publicly proclaim their anti-racist bona fides AND run a hot cheesecake shot that&rsquo;ll sell papers! From a 21st Century newspaper editor&rsquo;s POV, that&rsquo;s the ultimate Win-Win! </p>
<p>Even though it will certainly make me guilty of &#8220;speaking white,&#8221; here&rsquo;s my advice to these two &#8220;Nyoricans&#8221;: </p>
<p>Senor Martinez: Dig out your old J-school textbooks, skip the 17 or 18 chapters on racial sensitivity, and instead re-read the paragraph on the importance of verifying your quotes. Oh, there might also be a sentence or two about factchecking, see if you can find that bit, too. </p>
<p>Senorita Morales: Forget about waitressing and try to score some modeling jobs instead. Swimsuit issues, the Snap-On Tools calendar, or some similar &#8220;work&#8221; where you&rsquo;ll never need to open your mouth. That way you can go on &#8220;talking ghetto&#8221; forever. I&rsquo;m sure da boyz in your barrio prefer you like that anyhow. </p>
<p>As for me, well, next time in NYC I&rsquo;ll be patronizing the Hawaiian Tropic Zone, and rewarding this fine establishment with some of my tourist dollars for maintaining their hiring standards. At least I&rsquo;ll be assured of being served by someone I can understand. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d say she wasnt hired because of her less than attractive appearance. If a requirement to be one of these girls in question is to be pretty, then they were well within their rights to deny her employment. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to find a news clip so I can hear the accent. Instead, a few people pointed out the photoshop.<br/>
Note the jagged edge of her side, under the left armpit.<br/>
Is that a tattoo near her left wrist?</p>

			<p>One wonders what the demographics of those frequenting &#8220;Hawaiian Tropic Zone&#8221; are, and if the situations were reveresed anyone in Big Media would give a damn.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I guess they want their girls to speak white,&rdquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Unlike the Idiot Box, where every white main character - male or female - has a sassy, ghetto-speaking, foul-mouthed black (mostly) female sidekick willing to dish advice based in <i>reality</i> or <i>the streets</i>, the average white (if not most Americans) would be repelled by the low-class, crude etc nature of &#8220;ghetto&#8221; talk.</p>
<p>And Miss Morales here is yet another reason why the category of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; in U.S. government statistics is ambiguous:<br/>
If a hate crime occurs against her, she will be declared &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; but if she commits a hate crime she will be classed as &#8220;White&#8221;.</p>

			<p>  Is it now against the law to require that employees be able to take customer orders and be understood ?<br/>
  If she speaks like she came from the ghetto then many customers will not be able to understand her.<br/>
  This seems to me as another reason we should require that English be the language of the USA.<br/>
  It is not a business I would go to.</p>

			<p>She is shaking the money tree and doing a publicity stunt at the same time. They need to dismiss her complaint.</p>
<p>There is no Federal protection for accents, or red hair, or freckles, or missing fingers, or obesity, or large noses, or crooked teeth, or ugly tattoos, or weird body piercings.</p>
<p>Thank God!</p>

			<p>IT&rsquo;s interesting how Melody equates her &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; accent with a particular color as though Hispanic and White are mutually exclusive.  I would imagine hypothetically that HTZ would not reject Salma Hayek or Penelope Cruz were they just two regular women who were applying for the job. <br/>
If Melody goes around using Caribbean street jargon or trying to imitate Black speech which combined with the Spanish accent is not pretty, then she has cooked her own goose.<br/>
I assume that speaking &#8220;white&#8221; involves speaking articulately and not calling people &#8220;Mami&#8221;. The expression on her face screams attitude.  I wonder if she has mastered the art of the head rotation while getting in someone else&rsquo;s face with one hand on the hip and the other jabbing a finger at the person in whose face she&rsquo;s getting. She also needs to lose the obnoxious dark lip liner. Why do they insist on emulating the lowest common denominator of their ethnicity rather than those who are credits such as José Ferrer, Rosalind Sanchez, Rita Moreno, Raul Julia (RIP), Oscar de la Renta, Gloria Estéfan etc.? That was merely a rhetorical question. <br/>
Your picture speaks for itself Melody. It&rsquo;s your attitude not your accent. ¡Aprende hija!<br/>

			<p>&ldquo;I guess they want their girls to speak white,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Even if it were true that that is what customer&rsquo;s want (and I doubt it, horny guys could care less about accents and in fact may find it a turn on) so what. Many Latin establishments (and other ethnic places) don&rsquo;t want it white. So much for freedom of choice, freedom of any kind.</p>

  &mdash;  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a point.  I would have at least had her parade around in a bikini before I talked about her trashy accent.  </p>
<p>While this incident is easy to laugh at, the attitude of the dysfunctional minority is not.  They don&rsquo;t realize that a job is not something given, it is something done.  Ghetto culture does not lend itself to success in the work world.  Dealing with people, learning basic skills like speaking, writing, following directions, are all anathema to the ghetto dweller.<br/>

			<p>Another edition of the ghetto lottery!  Thank you for playing!  </p>
<p>Business dies in areas where blacks and browns play their beloved &#8220;get rich quick&#8221; game, and then they whine like no tomorrow that there are no jobs.  </p>
<p>If this girl really wanted her &#8220;dream job&#8221;, as the article says, she&rsquo;d learn to speak English without butchering the language. The reality is that she knows the game where a huge payday is but a lawsuit away. </p>
<p>There is not a sober mind in management on planet earth that would reject someone for a position like the one she&rsquo;s looking for simply because of an accent.  She most likely can&rsquo;t put a cogent sentence together, but this will come out in the suit.</p>
<p>Expect this insanity to get worse with obama in office.  After all, he will appoint the new head of the civil rights office which really means, &#8220;civil privilege&#8221;.   </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a sentence that will live on in infamy.  Dream big, girlfriend!  </p>
<p>What kind of woman would bring her mother along to apply for this type of job?  Or any job, for that matter.  Her story stinks to high heaven - I suspect she heard the restaurant was being sued for big money, so she invented or embellished this story to hop on the lawsuit gravy train.  Mom was along to say, &#8220;I heard the whole thing!  We want justice [money]!&#8221; and help her daughter hit the ghetto lottery.  </p>

			<p>I have a feeling it wasn&rsquo;t the manager who told her she didn&rsquo;t speak white, and feel strongly that this is how she rephrased it in her own ghetto slang. Which would pretty well prove his point. I have heard these high pitched hoochie mama voices before, as they butcher the butcher the English language, with their street slang, and it&rsquo;s almost like fingernails on a chalkboard.</p>

			<p>Besides her accent her problem is probably her inability to speak through her mouth. Most young NY born latinas (under 35) have this horrible habit of speaking through their noses. Just watch a movie with Rosie Ruiz and it will drive you absolutely crazy listening to her. She is a NY born latina although she is well over 35. So in addition to horrible English and street ghetto slang speaking through the nose is more than most people can handle.</p>

			<p>Good!  I cannot stand listening to Hispanic accents!  Sometimes I watch &#8220;Without a Trace&#8221; but have to mute the TV when Roselyn Sanchez speaks. Her accent grates on my nerves.  I would not eat at a restaurant with waitresses with Mestizo accents.  Just the other day, I called a company for customer assistance, had to &#8220;press one for English&#8221;, and then got a girl whose foreign accent was so thick I had to have her repeat every other statement.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t for a minute believe they wouldn&rsquo;t hire this skank b/c she doesn&rsquo;t speak white. Even if the Hooters is mostly white dudes, some like the girls with &#8220;flava&#8221;. </p>
<p>Besides, they already said that restaurants like Hooters can discriminate against men by refusing to hire them so the restaurant should be able to say a girl is too ugly (or fat or whatever) and not hire them. </p>

			<p>She also has the ghetto &#8220;head tilt&#8221; attitude showing in that pic.</p>
<p>The manager should have just said she didn&rsquo;t &#8220;speak standard English&#8221;&hellip; he could have gotten away with that&hellip; saying she didn&rsquo;t &#8220;speak white&#8221; made it a racial issue, even though it&rsquo;s obviously not.</p>
<p>If I had a nickel for every time some ghetto type assumed I didn&rsquo;t like them because of their skin color, as opposed to their rotten attitude, I&rsquo;d&hellip; have a lot of nickels.</p>

			<p>She and her lawyer is suing for thousands of dollars of money she believes she would have made after working their for years. Automatically. she is assuming she would be such a popular waitress she would make a heap of money in tips. Ironically, if she tried to sue, saying he told her she had a great body but her face was unattractive, and her look too cheap, she wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance. But by saying he made derisive comments about her ethnic accent, she automatically has a case for racial discrimination, and is looking to receive a giant windfall from it. If she were to win, I have to wonder what the fallout from it will be. Will non-white women start suing Modeling agencies claiming they were rejected because of their race, even if they have a face that could stop a clock? Point is, nobody was obligated to hire her.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like she ever even went in for an interview. This article below almost makes it seem like she was stalking them. Apparently, she went to the restaurant several times asking if their were job openings, and the waitresses would always tell her yes, there was. But whenever she asked the managers, they would tell her there were no openings! Which says from the get-go, that they never felt she was right for the job and even worthy of interviewing. Apparently, she was told all this on the phone, when her Mother was supposedly listening in,  I can only gather she was driving them crazy at that point, and decided to just lay their cards on the table. You can also see by some of her remarks that she is about as deep as a bottle cap, stating she felt overdressed working in a tank top and shorts at Hooters. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;I guess they want their girls to speak white,&rdquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Well, one thing about speaking &#8220;white&#8221; sweetheart (which a very well spoken black lady one told me simply meant &#8220;speaking while literate&#8221;):</p>
<p>Everyone can understand it!</p>
<p>Kind of important when you have to deal with customers at random, especially in a pricey joint. </p>

			<p>In 30 years of working and applying for different jobs, I have never heard of an employer telling an applicant right out &#8220;we won&rsquo;t hire you because of such and such.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s &#8220;Thanks for coming in, we&rsquo;ll call and let you know.&#8221;<br/>
That is code for either rejection or further consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard &#8220;We don&rsquo;t have any openings right now&#8221;.  I have failed typing and aptitude tests.  But no one has ever told me, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t hire you because of some personal quality.&#8221; </p>
<p>I agree with annonymous that after 40 years of affirmative action and lawsuits, everyone involved in hiring and supervision has been trained to be extremely non biased and politically correct.</p>
<p>Does she sound like that horrible nasal, whining Brooklyn girl Janice, Chandler&rsquo;s old girl friend from &#8220;Friends&#8221;?</p>
<p>I have a close friend who grew up in Brooklyn.  She has no Noo Yawk accent whatsoever.  I once asked her why.  Her parents sent her to private school and speech lessons to ensure she never aquired a Noo Yawk accent.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t pay the picture much mind yesterday, but after a few comments made above, went back to look. She actually appear to be a light-skinned/mixed-race Black to me. Realizing, of course, that &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; can mean almost anything racial/ethnically speaking, she still looke more Black than anything. Just an observation&hellip; </p>

True! I think the problem is this wannabe employee, just would not take no for an answer. She actually applied for the job a grand total of 15 times, and persistently hounded the managers about hiring her. Later, she decided to call them up and, ask them why not? Out of frustration they might have told her the truth about her ghetto accent, though I seriously doubt they said &#8220;You don&rsquo;t speak white&#8221; That alone, sounds like her very ghetto reinterpretation of it. She says it has always been her dream to work in a hot pink bikini, and a sarong, not to mention making up to $500 a day. So now she is suing for the amount she would have made after several years of employment there. Sickening!!! </p>

<p>I read somewhere she is the daughter of Dominican and Puerto Rican parents. 75% of Dominicans have black ancestry, so you&rsquo;re more than likely right about that.</p>
