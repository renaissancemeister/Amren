<h1>Murder Factory, Part 1: 64130, The ZIP Code of Notoriety in Missouri</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Rizzo, Kansas City Star, January 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Behind every pull of the trigger there is a story.</p>
<p>In the Kansas City ZIP code 64130, there are a lot of stories to tell.</p>
<p>Its eight square miles, straddling Brush Creek downstream from the Country Club Plaza, is home to 101 convicted murderers incarcerated in Missouri prisons.</p>
<p>No other ZIP code in Kansas City, St. Louis or any other part of the state comes close. Though its 26,000 residents make up about 6 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, it accounts for 20 percent of Kansas Citians in prison for murder or voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>If society set out to design an assembly line for producing killers, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a model any more efficient than what exists inside its boundaries, stretching from 39th to 63rd streets and bordered by Woodland and Topping avenues. It has become a murder factory that spans generations.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented effort to better understand the destructive paths these inmates chose, The Star sent surveys to all 101 killers who listed 64130 as their home ZIP code with the Missouri Department of Corrections. To compare their experiences with others, The Star also sent surveys to about 270 other convicted killers from across the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the majority of 64130&rsquo;s residents live lawfully, few interviewed said their families have been untouched by the violence. Longtime residents can point out where someone was killed, where drugs are sold or where a neighbor&rsquo;s kid lived before he went to prison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though each inmate has a unique story, many shared common experiences.</p>
<p>Born mostly into poor families, nearly 60 percent of survey respondents grew up without fathers. As young men they were thrust into a prevailing street mentality that demanded a violent response to any insult. Guns could be obtained as cheaply and easily as illegal drugs. Two-thirds of survey respondents possessed guns as teenagers and nearly three-fourths were regular users of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the time they killed, they ranged in age from 13 to 55. One-fifth committed murder as teenagers. Most already had criminal records when they killed in their 20s and 30s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bad influences</p>
<p>Many who became killers said they had few examples of legitimate success to follow in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Instead they were drawn to the fast life of hustling, stealing and dealing drugs. Jewelry, wads of cash and flashy cars, often displayed by older family members, lured them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Again and again, 64130&rsquo;s murderers said the area offers little in the way of positive alternatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broken homes, domestic violence and absent or drug-addicted parents also affected their upbringing.</p>
<p>Mothers who tried to raise boys alone say the necessity to work and support their families prevented them from watching their children as closely as they wanted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even when two adults were in the home, many of the ZIP code&rsquo;s killers experienced harmful influences. For example, more than half of the survey&rsquo;s respondents said they witnessed domestic violence growing up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least 15 of the 64130 killers were convicted of domestic violence homicides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up, you&rsquo;re conditioned to think that a physical fight will at times take place between two people who love and care about each other, especially when you see them continue to stay together,&#8221; said inmate Benjamin Franklin Jr., who was 22 when he stabbed his estranged wife to death.</p>
<p>The home turf</p>
<p>Single-family residences dominate 64130, a ZIP code that many outsiders see only when they zoom through on Bruce R. Watkins Drive or Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard.</p>
<p>Pockets of middle-class stability  &mdash;  such as Sheraton Estates and the Citadel Center development  &mdash;  have the look and feel of typical Johnson County suburbs.</p>
<p>But vacant houses, trash-strewn lots and weed-choked yards plague many blocks. A large percentage of residents live in poverty. Decades of relentless violence have left too many feeling under siege and cut off from the wider community.</p>

<p>The skinny on the zip, including racial demographics, which should be of no surprise.</p>
<p>Kansas City, Missouri is incorporated in four different Missouri counties.  However, nearly all of the residential developed areas are south of the Missouri River in Jackson County.  And virtually all of them are majority if not heavily black, most of the rest being Hispanics.</p>
<p>The good news is that St. Louis doesn&rsquo;t have the most murderous zip code in the state.</p>

			<p>Wow, so apparently this zip code is an &#8220;assembly line for producing killers.&#8221;  It has nothing to do with the people living there; it is just an evil plot of land with dark, magical powers.  I wonder what the crime rate in this &#8220;assembly line&#8221; would be if the residents were all replaced by middle-class whites?  Don&rsquo;t worry though; &#8220;CHANGE&#8221; is here.  I fully expect black crime rates to drop to close to 0% within the first year of an Obama presidency.</p>

<p>Is this being done to them or done by them? When you answer that question honestly, you might find effective solutions.</p>

			<p>I hope that this problem is solved someday. My older brother was a victim of a gun violence (he lived thank GOD). I went to a black school and lost a friend to violence. The whole school took it hard. This is an important subject matter so don&rsquo;t make fun of these people some are really GOOD. I had black friend  who lived in a gang related neighborhood, had domestic violence in his life, and one of his brothers went to jail. He graduated high school and goes to college we still keep in touch.</p>
<p>When we were growing up he said his neighborhood was almost like 20-30yr old men with a violent 5yr old mindset running these gangs. They kill people for the most foolish reasons.</p>
<p>Instead of critizing these people be thankful that you and your family live somewhere nice and have the ability to have access to computer.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s almost comical how the writer of this article steps through this minefield to avoid mentioning that he was talking about Black people.  Not once.  If he had, he would probably have lost his job.  What&rsquo;s race got to do with it?  Crime is crime, regardless of who commits it, right?</p>
<p>If, as the Marxists would like us to believe, that poverty causes crime, practically every White person in this country during the Great Depression would have turned into a murderer and rapist.  The zip code 64130 has the same criminal problems as most cities in Africa.  Coincidence?</p>

			<p>These problems may be handled efficiently, but Whites are too frightened.  Jail does not work, and is expensive.  Violent criminals should be executed.  Chronic criminals should be banished to any foreign land that will take them.  Teens should be offered money to be sterilized.  Also if drugs were legalized, crime would drastically decrease.  Let the degenerates get high and die as long as they don&rsquo;t hurt anyone else.</p>

			<p>Segregation and mistreatment did not give rise to the &ldquo;no snitching rule.&rdquo; Virtually everyone in the ghetto is involved in some type of crime. Every  home has some stolen property, occupants with outstanding warrants, child support absconders, drug dealers, and food stamp and welfare fraud. Nobody talks because everyone has an interest in keeping the police away.</p>

			<p>This all boils down to genes.  The white race was not given their wealth on this planet by some magical intervention.  Each racial group had to work toward their own material well being.  The white race has foolishly destroy their material well being by wars BUT they have always rebuilt on their own.  Because the black race has inferior genes, they always have and will EXPECT to be given something by another racial group.  They play this guilt trip of being forced into slavery BUT they are unable to better themselves by their own efforts.  This is so whether in Africa or in other countries.  They are utterly unable to compete on their abilities. </p>

<p>This was one of the pictures in the photo gallery.  Ironically, many of the purveyors of this &#8220;filthy music&#8221; openly supported Obama, and Obama didn&rsquo;t exactly rebuke them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Broken homes, domestic violence and absent or drug-addicted parents&#8221; - These are the reasons for this kind of society.<br>
You can pour billions and billions of dollars into whatever program the leftists devise, but you won&rsquo;t see ANY progress until adults start being responsible and staying together, being a good example for their kids, and raising them properly.<br>
Unfortunately, I hold little confidence for that happening.</p>

			<p>In 1971 the &#8220;Yankee&#8221; judges mandated a forced busing program to my high school. This HS was in the best part of town, had the best educational and athletic facilities and the best teaching staff.</p>
<p>One would think that the blacks would have taken advantage of this educational opportunity.</p>
<p>They did&hellip; The very first day of school, I was turned away from the HS by Florida State Troopers telling me to go back home. In the distance I could see a plume of dark black smoke rising from the cafeteria. The black students had gotten angry about filling out new documentation and somebody retaliated by setting the cafeteria on fire.</p>
<p>In one year the blacks turned that school inside out and upside down. This was the real beginning of my education in race relations.</p>

<p>But nowhere do you offer any solution.  </p>
<p>&#8220;be thankful that you and your family live somewhere nice&#8221;,,,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the AREA. It&rsquo;s the PEOPLE. Switch the people from a solid middle-class White community (or a Japanese or Japanese-American one for that matter) with these people and you would see crime drop dramatically in 64130 and rise just as dramatically in the (formerly) &#8220;nice&#8221; area where these people would now reside. Like all blacks you cannot establish cause and effect. </p>
<p>  &#8220;have the ability to have access to a computer&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> What does that have to do with anything??? Any public library has them. What does having a computer have to do with homicides?</p>

<p><i>Posted by rational thinker at 8:17 PM on January 27 </i></p>
<p><br>
Why do I live &#8220;somewhere nice&#8221;?  Was I assigned to my neighborhood randomly, or did I work hard in school and then my job to be able to afford to live here?</p>
<p>Why is my neighborhood &#8220;nice&#8221;?  What makes it nice?  [Hint: it&rsquo;s not 95% black like the zip code in this article.  In fact, there are only a handful of blacks]</p>
<p>Why do I &#8220;have the ability to have access to computer&#8221;?  Does that ability come randomly to certain lucky people, with no action required to make it happen?  Did my computer fall from the sky into my lap?  Or did I <i>earn</i> what I have, including my skills?  </p>
<p>My husband was the first person in his large family to graduate from college.  His family members were all farmers, miners, or tradesmen.  In spite of poverty, humble origins and lack of college, <i>none</i> of his relatives went to prison or trashed their communities.  Why do you think that is?  </p>
<p>If committing &#8220;gun violence&#8221; or going to prison is some tragic illness that innocent poor people catch, then why didn&rsquo;t my husband&rsquo;s family catch it when their steel mill closed?  </p>
<p>Do you really think stolen guns fall into Tyrone&rsquo;s hand and shoot themselves, much to his shock and horror, because he caught some sort of violence virus that avoids people like me?  </p>

<p>True enough. Not only that but studies have shown that there would be no more people who have problems with drugs than there are now. However, this will never happen because there is too much money in it. &#8220;Wait a minute&#8221;, you say. &#8220;The government won&rsquo;t legalize it because there is too much money in it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The meataphor of &#8216;elephant sitting in the room&rsquo; has never ben more apt than when reading this article.<br>
  The real fascinating thing (the actual content of the article is standard boiler-plate, obvious to all Amreners), is the actual self-deception going on in the mind of the writer as he systematically evades, deceives and avoids the only real issue worth mentioning in the hope of conning the reader.<br>
  Alas, this only points to an unfortunate truth about the human condition - Just how ruthleslly and cold-bloodedly deceptive and mendacious some people (with authority) can be in lying to the public.</p>

<p>I agree more people should be offered money to be sterilized, once you factor in the surgery and the amount of money payed it would be worth it in the long run.</p>
<p>Also if drugs were legalized, crime would drastically decrease. Let the degenerates get high and die as long as they don&rsquo;t hurt anyone else.</p>
<p>If drugs were legalized that would only intenesfy the situation. Remember drugs turn you into a different person. Remember Rodney King he got up from being tasered, pepper sprayed, hit and kicked (all justified) and didn&rsquo;t comply with orders. Do you want that in your neighborhood. Remember whites experment with drugs too at a teenage year.</p>

Since there was no mention of it in the article a person is left to scratching his head and making wild guesses. Might they be Chinese or perhaps people of German or Danish descent? Someone please help, who might they be?</p>

<p><i>I <b>hope</b> that this problem is <b>solved someday</b></i>.</p>
<p>To rational thinker:</p>
<p>You chide us for criticizing these people while living peacefully and comfortably with our computers is stable and safe neighborhoods.</p>
<p>You &ldquo;hope&rdquo; this problem is solved &ldquo;someday&rdquo;. If you are a rational thinker, what are your solutions?</p>
<p>Does transferring black kids to white schools improve black test scores?</p>
<p>Does transferring blacks into white neighborhoods decrease black on black violence?</p>
<p>Does building more rec centers in black communities &lsquo;stop the violence&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Does allowing graffiti &ldquo;artists&rdquo; to paint rec center exterior and interior walls stop gang initiations and gang violence?</p>
<p>Does spending money on housing and social programs decrease out of wedlock births?</p>
<p>Does putting more police officers in black communities decrease violence or only exacerbate anger, resentment, and hatred for the police?</p>
<p>What rational solutions can you think of that have been tried and worked? What rational solutions that haven&rsquo;t been tried that you believe will work?</p>
<p>Until blacks and Hispanics moved into my community, crime was extremely low. Violent and drug crimes were an anomaly. The safety and security of my community bred anger and resentment by blacks and Hispanics that my community was better. Blacks and Hispanics refuse to believe it&rsquo;s the quality of people living in my community that was the difference. They believe my community was simply &lsquo;better&rsquo; and they wanted in. This led to demands that HUD and other do-good groups transfer blacks and Hispanics into my community.</p>
<p>The result has been as predicable as the sun rise.</p>
<p>Home invasions, armed robberies by black men with assault weapons of local credit unions, black men being picked up for robbing armored trucks, two Hispanic men beating up an 80 year old man in his home during a robber, a 68 year old white woman who was nearly raped in her home by a black man who was stopped only because her husband came home. A white college student raped in the bathroom of a small local college by a black man. These are only a few of the incidents I can name off the top of my head.  Everyone I speak to as community meetings have their own horror stories that don&rsquo;t make it into the local news.</p>
<p>Rational thinker, what do you believe the problems are? What do you propose are the solutions?</p>

<p>First of all I never chided you for how live nice because you for it and earned it. People here have the tendcy to thrash blacks when some really do work hard.</p>
<p>what do you believe the problems are? What do you propose are the solutions?</p>
<p>The problem is to many people having kids. They have kids with people they barely know (which is all their fault) and don&rsquo;t know how to raise their kids. The plan is simple make birth control, abortion, and sterilization more easily available.</p>
<p>I lived in BLACK neighborhood in the South while in high school. I got in a few fights but that&rsquo;s it. I liked it alot. I believe they were misguided as youth&rsquo;s and now it&rsquo;s to late too change some of them. I&rsquo;ve seen former gangbangers complete high school and go to college. I just don&rsquo;t like people who never experienced enough black and make too many sterotypical comments.They can do better for the next generation.</p>

			<p>Wow, did this story hit close to home! I used to live in KC (hence my monicker) in the 64132 zip code area, which borders 64130 to the south, about 2 miles from Bannister Mall. Speaking of Bannister Mall, it was just demolished last week after being out of business for about two years (gee! I wonder why).<br>
That mall was THE place to shop 20 years ago. People came from as far away as Olathe and Mission and the world&rsquo;s largest Wal-Mart was just across the street. Wal-Marts just don&rsquo;t shut down for any reason. I know people who live in the middle of nowhere who drive 80 miles roundtrip to go to the Wal-Mart in Kirksville, MO. The AAA office where I used to get travel books is gone. Also gone are the Luby&rsquo;s, the Olive Garden, the Red Lobster, Berbiglia&rsquo;s (a great liquor store), the Best Buy and a myriad of other places that once made up a thriving commercial area. There have been jokes made about the Prospect bus being full on the way to Bannister Mall and being half empty on the way back, and they&rsquo;re not all fiction.<br>
Flamethrower, right on! Most normal people like to go fishing, bowling or waterskiing if they feel like it; or eat and drink whatever, whenever and how much they want, then bed down with the wife after a long day. Jail is like a high school reunion to some people.<br>
To Anonymous 10:49, not to detract from your eloquent statement,please allow me to alter slightly your opening sentence. It&rsquo;s all about green! Liberal do-gooders don&rsquo;t get it. Economics doesn&rsquo;t lie. If I am forced to be in a kill or be killed situation every time I patronize an area where my white skin is a liability, I&rsquo;ll drive miles out of my way to spend money in Raymore or Overland Park. With the exception of a couple of BBQ restaurants, me and my money are miles away from those parts of town.<br>
Question Diversity, the sad truth is that KC is as bad if not worst than St. Louis, even though St. Louis is mercilessly maligned here at this end of the Show Me state. At least, you have some reasonable explanations, your city is boxed in and can&rsquo;t expand into the county, your urban decay began decades before KC&rsquo;s, and St. Louis&rsquo; percentage of blacks is much higher. Kansas City is a freaking pathetic joke! On a happier note, QD, I enjoyed my Christmas in St. Louis and my family treated me to one of your city&rsquo;s culinary delights, ooey gooey butter cake. DELICIOUS!</p>

			<p>This is a good case for why segregation was good then, should be good now, and would be good forever as blacks and Latinos are uncontrollable in their crime rates.  Sometimes, I despair at the present generation (my generation), who should know the natural viciousness of blacks, who are highly resentful of the Mexicans who o are moving up the socioeconomic ladder much quicker  &mdash;  not like the whites of course  &mdash;   but the blacks only know intimidation  I feel Obama&rsquo;s vacation is over as well.</p>

<p>First off, were you able to try any toasted ravioli?</p>
<p>To the subject at hand, I know you know a lot of the differences between St. Louis and Kansas City that Our Better Minds allow us to think about.  But one taboo difference is that St. Louis whites tend to be derived from various ethno-conscious white ethnic immigrants, while whites in Kansas City tend to have roots in the plains, who think of themselves as &#8220;regular Americans.&#8221;  Conservatism in St. Louis tends to be white racialism, while in Kansas City it&rsquo;s economic libertarianism.  In spite of the fact that Kansas City proper is more black as a percentage of the whole than St. Louis proper, and KC has more Hispanics.</p>
<p>Still, somehow, back in the days of the Citizens Councils, there were three chapters in Kansas City, the same as St. Louis had.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;If drugs were legalized that would only intenesfy (sic) the situation&hellip;. Do you want that in your neighborhood&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unwinnable Drug War already is in our neighborhoods  &mdash;  it has created criminals on the street trying to support $100-a-day habits and pushers on high school campuses.<br>
 <br>
Flamethrower is correct when he writes: &#8220;&hellip;if drugs were legalized, crime would drastically decrease&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does ANYONE believe we are winning this Insane War on Drugs? Do you believe that children will have easier access to drugs if they were to become legal?  How could they have more access to drugs than they do now?  Drugs are being sold in the schools.  </p>
<p>The government cannot keep drugs out of the country; it cannot even keep drugs out of the prisons.</p>
<p>Government suppression of anything people want creates a HUGE Black Market, run by those who are willing to break the law for huge profits  &mdash;  profits that fund violent criminal empires and corrupt law enforcement.</p>
<p>Prohibition of drugs does not work.  When prohibition of alcohol ended, the crime wave of the 20s subsided.</p>
<p>Libertarian leader Harry Browne went to his grave railing at  politicians who fight desperately to continue this insane War on Drugs. Harry saw the War on Drugs for what it is: an excuse to make big government bigger.  He was right of course.</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;The Drug War has been easily the greatest cause of violent crime in American history. There is nothing that could make our cities safer than repealing the drug laws – all of them&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
