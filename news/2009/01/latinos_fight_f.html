<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17703.html">Latinos Fight for Political Recognition</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gebe Martinez, The Politico, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as Hispanics look to Obama to help realize their agenda, and as they take seats in the new president&rsquo;s Cabinet and on congressional leadership teams, they also are facing an annoying reality: There remains a gap between the power they have earned and the Washington elite&rsquo;s perception of their power.</p>
<p>One reason for the lag in perception may be that Latino policy leaders as well as individual members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have matured politically at a faster speed than has the caucus as a whole.</p>
<p>As the civil rights groups, political organizers and lawmakers have steered Latinos toward unprecedented levels of activism, the congressional caucus  &mdash;  haunted by past internal fighting and disorganization  &mdash;  is still being challenged to show that the sum of its parts makes it as strong as it should be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That anyone needs to be reminded of Latinos&rsquo; influence and the caucus&rsquo;s relevance is almost mind-boggling to Latino civil rights and policy leaders. They often find themselves reciting the recent history: Hispanics have reached the highest levels of political leadership on Capitol Hill, and the exponential growth of the Hispanic population and voters during the past decade has made them a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Just ask Republicans, whose dramatic loss of Hispanic support in the last election sent them into soul-searching political rehab.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latinos are toiling mightily for top Obama administration appointments they believe they earned. They celebrated when they got three Cabinet seats, only to be disappointed and even angry when New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson withdrew from consideration as secretary of commerce because a grand jury is probing possible political corruption in his home state.</p>
<p>On the key issue of immigration, civil rights leaders are hopeful, but not sure, that during his first year in office Obama will keep his campaign promise to present a broad plan to overhaul immigration laws that expand visas and protect workers.</p>
<p>Also, the League of United Latin American Citizens, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Council of La Raza and others are on Capitol Hill, trying to convince Democratic and Republican senators to remove the current requirement for legal immigrant children and pregnant women to wait five years before receiving benefits through the State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has yet to prove that it has the agility to be proactive rather than reactive and that it can lead rather than just complain.</p>
<p>Velazquez won the Hispanic Caucus chairmanship without opposition, because the men wanted to avoid a repeat of a nasty gender fight two years ago that led to California Democratic Reps. Loretta Sanchez and Linda T. Sanchez quitting the caucus. With Velazquez in charge, Linda Sanchez has rejoined the group, but her sister has not made a decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, there are many non-Hispanics who have an interest in seeing the caucus succeed, and Obama is among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it had not been for the Hispanic votes in places like Nevada, New Mexico or Colorado and probably several other places, I am not sure the president would be in the position that he is in, and I think he recognizes that,&#8221; said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.).</p>

			<p>Latinos fight for Political Recognition&#8221;  ( read &#8220;POWER&#8221;)</p>
<p>Now here is something clear, with no fiddling around that we can sink our teeth into.  Here is a genuine concern we can understand the motivation for. Here is some real authenticity, unlike the folks in Nashville, in the previous news item, who don&rsquo;t think English should be primary. Latinos know what their clear about;,Bilingual education costing Americans millions, saving their language and culture, and all by trying to get more power to make it real. I say Bravo, for those with a clear purpose.</p>

			<p>The Hispanics want more power, the other day we learned that the Asians want more power, and the blacks not only whine about wanting more power they whine about everything.  But the one thing they all have in common is that none of them want equality.  They want to dominate and be in control.</p>
<p>This silly idea that these out-of-touch leftists and many conservative politicians have of thinking that all these third worlders want is to be part of a multicultural utopia and assimilate into the culture of this country is absolute nonsense.  They want to be in the driver&rsquo;s seat, preferably with all the other races expelled from the country.</p>
<p>And every single tribe is getting bolder and more demanding every day.  But, hang on.  Just when you think it can&rsquo;t get any worse it will.  And you can take that to the bank.</p>

			<p>I went food shopping in different town the other day, and I observed a large number of mexican customers.  I noticed that virtually every mexican female was either pregnant, accompanied by children - or both.  I also noticed that many were consorting with their husbands or relatives in spanish as they roamed the isles.  </p>
<p>Whereas many of the whites I know are scared to death to raise children right now due to the economy, mexicans don&rsquo;t appear deterred.  I assume most of them work - and should their paycheck come up short, the white-funded government will pick-up the slack.  They don&rsquo;t worry about affording status like whites do, and since necessities here are almost guaranteed, they simply do what comes naturally and multiply.  I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in for a rough century.       </p>

<p>These whiners are nothing compared to what the muslims are going to demand, and the muslims will be prepared to kill everyone else to get what they want.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t Latinos already have political power in their home nations?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t those home nations   &mdash;   every one, at this count   &mdash;   need political help?</p>
<p>Why are they throwing away their energy here, in an adopted country, when they could be fixing problems at home?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like me moving to Russia and agitating for American rights and political representation there.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s refreshing to witness the rebirth of Hispanic power in this country.  It is long overdue. I am hopeful that Pres. Obama will introduce a comprehensive solution to the immigration crises. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics all have a vested interest in Comprehensive reform which is one of the few guarenteed solutions to the current economic crises. Without jobs, minorities cannot work and feed their families and hence, will have no &#8220;power&#8221;. Comprehensive reform will provide jobs, raise wages, and increase the standard of living among these groups. I wish most were astute enough to realize it.</p>

<p>Paid for by the white man of course.  One would wonder why we would have a need to expand visas to people whose services are unlikely to be valuable enough to afford proper medical care.  But of course, silly me, its about politics.  Admit more Latinos, garner more votes.  The Latinos acquire more power and influence, thus the politicians work harder to appease the Latinos.  And whites are too scared to say a word, lest they identify themselves as &#8220;racists.&#8221;  Wonderful. <br>

			<p>We are allowing foreigners to make decisions for us. We have leaders who have no intentions on guarding the borders. We have mass corruption on every level of government. We indulge in vices and sexual immorality now more than ever. We put no value in our education system and we can&rsquo;t compete with other nations (it&rsquo;s not just a black thing anymore). Our military is not at it&rsquo;s full potential (it is still the best in the world).</p>
<p>We are undoubtly going the way ROMANS, GREEKS, EYGPTIANS etc. Does anyone know what we can do to compeletly reform our government? This is were we should have a real clash of ideas.</p>

<p> Fear not, soon the welfare and nanny state will come<br>
crashing down. This economy can no longer afford it. And<br>
California has started to postpone welfare payments. Soon<br>
this will spread nationwide. Welfare and other social<br>
services that minorities see as their God given right, <br>
will be no more.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Munoz&#8221; comes off like a white lemming here to brainwash or irritate.  As hard as it is to fathom for most people, this country is on the verge of total collapse. I have little doubt whites will finally come to their senses after being kicked in the teeth. I also have little doubt, as cruel as it may seem to some, that most non-whites, especially latinos will be forced out of the country. They can then straighten out their own countries or starve, because they won&rsquo;t be getting welfare or getting jobs they don&rsquo;t deserve simply because of their skin color. </p>

<p>For the record, there has never been any &#8220;Hispanic power&#8221; in the U.S. Munoz is another Latino wrongly awarding credit to Latinos for the achievements of Spaniards. California has been employing Munoz&rsquo;s economic and cultural playbook with tragic results. I wish Munoz, and others, were more astute to see the error in his reasoning.</p>

			<p>What I hear in Munoz as with most Hispanics is that they are Hispanics first and Americans last. Also, the only immigration reform we need is to immediatly send all the ones that are here illegally back to where they came from. That would be a boost for the economy like nothing else.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask you a few simple questions.<br>
  <br>
·	Will Hispanic illegals ever stop invading our country if we don&rsquo;t take action against them?</p>
<p>·	Will the Hispanics who are here now ever leave our country if we don&rsquo;t take action against them?</p>
<p>·	Will endless waves of invading Hispanic illegals from all of Latin America achieve demographic dominance if we don&rsquo;t take action against them?</p>
<p>And now the most important questions of all.  </p>
<p>·	Will taking Old Betsy down from over the mantelpiece and putting her to good use against our enemies prove to be the solution to the Hispanic problem?  </p>
<p>·	If not, does anyone have a better and more peaceful solution to the problem?  </p>
<p>No?  I didn&rsquo;t think so&hellip;      <br>
