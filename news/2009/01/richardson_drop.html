<h1>Richardson Drops Bid for Commerce Secretary Post</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nedra Pickler, AP, January 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson abandoned his nomination to become commerce secretary under pressure of a grand jury investigation into a state contract awarded to his political donors &mdash; an investigation that threatened to embarrass President-elect Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Richardson insisted he would be cleared in the investigation and Obama stood by the governor as an &#8220;outstanding public servant.&#8221; But both men said it has become clear that a grand jury probe would not be finished in time for Richardson&rsquo;s confirmation hearings and could keep him from filling the post in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Richardson&rsquo;s withdrawal was the first disruption of Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet process and the second &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221; investigation that has touched Obama&rsquo;s transition to the presidency. The president-elect has remained above the fray in both the case of arrested Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and the New Mexico case.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury is investigating how a California company that contributed to Richardson&rsquo;s political activities won a New Mexico transportation contract worth nearly $1.5 million. Richardson said in a statement issued by the Obama transition office that the investigation could take weeks or months but expressed confidence it will show he and his administration acted properly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A senior Obama adviser said Richardson gave assurances before he was nominated last month that he would come out fine in the investigation and the president-elect had no reason to doubt it. But as the grand jury continued to pursue the case, it became clear that confirmation hearings would have to be delayed for six weeks or even longer until the investigation was complete, said the adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity about the discussions because they were private.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A person familiar with the investigation in New Mexico has told The Associated Press that the grand jury is looking into possible &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221; dealings between CDR Financial Products and someone in a position to push the contract through with the state of New Mexico.</p>
<p>State documents show CDR was paid a total of $1.48 million in 2004 and 2005 for its work on a transportation program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Richardson] is one of the most prominent Hispanics in the Democratic Party, having served in Congress and as President Clinton&rsquo;s ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary. As governor, he has kept up an international profile with a specialty in dealing with rogue nations. Obama also considered him to be secretary of state.</p>
<p>CDR and Rubin have contributed at least $110,000 to three political committees formed by Richardson, according to an AP review of campaign finance records.</p>
<p>The largest donation, $75,000, was made by CDR in June 2004 &mdash; a couple of months after the transportation financing arrangement won state approval &mdash; to a political committee that Richardson established before the Democratic National Convention that year.</p>

		<p>Someone I feel a little bit sorry for is New Mexico&rsquo;s Lieutenant Governor, Diane Denish.  Here, she thought she would get to become Governor, and it gets taken away from her.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t you understand that it&rsquo;s Latino culture and ethics to take bribes? Richardson did nothing wrong, he just followed different cultural and ethic standards. And only racists would hold this against him. After all, all cultures are equal, and morality is relative, so we are in no position to judge him.</p>
<p>Also, if he remained a member of Obama administration, he would make the government so more vibrant, with colorful people taking bribes and playing favors, just like the Mexican government does. Without him, it will be the old boring business and usual.<br/>

		<p>Well, this is the only good news we&rsquo;ve received so far after experiencing many set backs.  This man is an evil, pro-Hispanic racist that is concerned only with advancing any agenda that strictly favors Hispanics.</p>
<p>Like all leaders, black and Hispanic, they&rsquo;re ready and willing to form alliances in order to bring down the white power structure, so they&rsquo;re working together right now.  Richardson was an important part of that.</p>
<p>But it looks as if he just might get indicted, which will cost him his job as governor, which will get him out of the national spotlight altogether, unless he elects to start another La Raza from jail.</p>
<p>Take note that if these two groups ever get equal billing in some breakway state if we implode, they will fighting each other tooth and nail, much more so than they ever fought the white man.</p>

		<p>I knew all along this hispanic piece of garbage, had plenty to hide, and if per chance he wasn&rsquo;t too contaminated by graft and greed, why would he bow out???? BECAUSE HE&rsquo;S AS CROOKED AS THE RIO GRANDE RIVER. So what else is new???? He knew that plenty of dirt would come out in the investigation, and it WILL&hellip;.shows how corrupt most people on capital hill, really are&hellip;..as bad as the ones on wall street&hellip;.any questions?</p>

		<p>Richardson is only the tip of the iceberg of the scandals that will plague the 0bama administration.  He&rsquo;s now named Leon Panetta, a Clinton retread, with no intelligence experience to head the CIA.  Hopefully, by 2012 the majority of people will be ready to dump 0bama, now that their white guilt has been cured by electing him in the first place.</p>

		<p>Yeah, Richardson just &#8220;dropped the bid&#8221; for the job as commerce secretary,perhaps his time is more valuable elsewhere  &mdash;  like staying out of jail for instance. Crooks thieves and liars are what we have for representatives.</p>

		<p>Obama will either &#8220;walk on water&#8221;, or come down with the biggest crash ever during the next four years. I have a gut feeling that Obama will not only be America&rsquo;s FIRST Black President, but surely also it&rsquo;s LAST Black President. That the stench surely to be clinging to him and his administration will last for generations.</p>

		<p>For the life of me, I can&rsquo;t understand why this pent-up hatred for whites and the sense of envy Hispanics have, don&rsquo;t they band together in THEIR OWN COUNTRIES and make them economically feasible places to live rather than draging the parasitic mindset with them as they sneak into this country for the &#8220;American Dream?&#8221; Why not the &#8220;Mexican Dream&#8221; or the &#8220;El Salvador Dream,&#8221; etc? They hate us but being unimaginative, they only try to copy, not think on their own. Their sense of entitlement is outrageous. Go march and demand in your own country, then we might have some respect for you.</p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have happened to a nicer guy&hellip;</p>
<p>Found this article in the Huffington Post yesterday.  I&rsquo;ll scan this looney site every now and then just to see what the lefties are saying;  and for once, I actually found an op-ed worth reading&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called, &#8220;Richardson&rsquo;s Lies Have Finally Caught Up to Him,&#8221; by Geoffrey Dunn.  </p>
<p>Quite the read; and all I can say is, &#8220;Adios&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Fed Up is on to something.</p>
<p>Barry Obama will be the first AND last black president of the US. </p>
<p>Even if he were a charter Mensa member &amp; purer than the driven snow, he&rsquo;d still be destroyed by the economic &amp; international relations tsunami about to engulf him.</p>
<p>Besides, now that Baby Boomers have punched the &#8220;Elect a Black Man President&#8221; spot on their virtue ticket, they don&rsquo;t need to repeat the task.  It&rsquo;s on to electing the first woman, or the first Latino, or the first gay, or the first Mongoloid, or whatever.  </p>

		<p>Gotta agree there, Paul.  The raging mess created by Shrubya and the Dems he has grovelled to for the last 8 years would&rsquo;ve made any successor administration look bad.  I bet my wife before the election that Shrubya would go down in history as America&rsquo;s worst President&hellip; excepting whover was elected right after him.  Obama probably just doesn&rsquo;t know any better, but what about McCain?  He has enough experience to know otherwise; he must have been out of his mind to want the job.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s cabinet picks, as I predicted, are every bit the set of side-show freaks that Clinton chose in 1992.  With Shrillery as Secretary of State, Obama&rsquo;s ambassadorial appointments ought to be spectacularly amusing.</p>
