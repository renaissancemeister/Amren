<h1>D.C. Tattoo Parlors Offer Lasting Inaugural Memories</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristi Keck, CNN, January 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For those who want a more permanent way to showcase their support for Barack Obama, Washington&rsquo;s tattoo parlors are ready to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing more memorable than a tattoo,&#8221; said Matt Jessup, better known as &#8220;Fatty,&#8221; the owner of Fatty&rsquo;s Custom Tattooz and Body Piercing.</p>
<p>His shop is celebrating what it has dubbed the &#8220;Obamathan,&#8221; where customers can get a free &#8220;Obama &#8216;08&#8221; logo tattoo if they buy another tattoo worth $200. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment in our nation&rsquo;s history. And for many people, they are in town for this historic event, they want something to remember it by,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At Fatty&rsquo;s and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with.</p>
<p>The most popular choices so far have been the Obama logo, the word &#8220;hope,&#8221; and the now iconic red-and-blue Obama hope poster by Shepard Fairey.</p>
<p>T.J. Mohler, who works at Jinx Proof Tattoos, said business has been up as people flood the city, but only &#8220;about two or three&#8221; customers have gotten an Obama tattoo. One of those people is Mohler himself, who opted for a 5 x 7-inch Obama image on his leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I look back in 50 years, it will remind me of the time and how excited everyone is,&#8221; Mohler said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fatty&rsquo;s also offers a removable option  &mdash;  the Obama piercing. It&rsquo;s an orbital ring with a blue bead that costs $44, in honor of the 44th president.</p>
<p>And if a customer has a change of heart post-tattoo, Fatty says all is not lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on back and I&rsquo;ll cover it up with something else,&#8221; he said.<br>

			<p> Both tattoos and tee-shirts fall under the umbrella of my mother`s first commandment. &#8220;The fact that you`re wearing one speaks louder than anything you have printed on it.&#8221;  Goes double for women and girls trying to look &#8220;hot&#8221;.  Or as another poster put it, &#8220;Who puts a bumper sticker on a Maserati?!?&#8221;  </p>

			<p>What is not mentioned in this article is the cost to remove these tattoos, which is what a lot of people who get them will want to do in two years, when unemployment is 15%, crime is way up, the standard of living is plummeting and gas shoots back up to $5 a gallon.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s sad to think that hundreds of stupid whites are going to mutilate their bodies with symbols of Comrade BO.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many young white women are going to have the name of the great &#8220;one&#8221; tramp-stamped on their once lovely bodies? Even worse, how many are going to be influenced, however subtly and not-so subtly, to miscegnate? Their white genes forever lost in the murky quagmire of mulatto children, hoping their child can someday grow up to become president.</p>

			<p>I applaud Matt Jessup&rsquo;s business acumen in recoginizing that their were literally thousands of suckers who would shell out money for something as dumb as this and capitalizing on it.</p>
<p>Talk about a tattoo that you are going to regret!</p>

			<p>In Japan, it is only the criminals who have tattoos.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m getting another tattoo soon to compliment my Celtic history.  Hey, at least I&rsquo;m not getting the Great Messiah drawn on my body!</p>

			<p>I have noticed that there tends to be an extremely high correlation between criminals and tattoos. I have heard that over eighty percent of all inmates have tattoos.</p>
<p>Does anyone here know of what percentage of the various races have tattoos?</p>

			<p>I wanted a tatoo of the &#8220;Great Seal of the State Of New Jersey&#8221;, contacted tatoo organizations from the Blue colored books on organizations, was told there is nobody who specializes in it, to bring a photograph to any tatoo parlor and they would do one, but have since declined because I have noticed the New Jersey State Courts do not respect my Right to due process of law.</p>

			<p>&#8216;HOPE&rsquo; for what?  Do these people realize that they already live in the most free and prosperous nation ever?  Do they realize that the average black in America is wealthier than the average Swede in Sweden?</p>
<p>My only HOPE is that our situation will not deteriorate quite as fast, or as dramatically, as I&rsquo;m sure they will.</p>

			<p>Ach, Mike Scott, I thought we had lost you!</p>
<p>Good to see you posting again!</p>
<p>CNN shamelessly pushes Obama. They even are selling a t-shirt that says, &#8220;When He raised His hand, He uplifted the whole nation!&#8221; The &#8220;He&#8221; refers to Obama.</p>
<p>I am not sure if they capitalize it, but it would not surprise me if they did. </p>
