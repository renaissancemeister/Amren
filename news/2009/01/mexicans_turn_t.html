<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D95VML4O0&amp;show_article=1">Mexicans Turn to Voodoo to Help Team Beat the US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mexican sports daily is pinning its hopes of beating the United States in a World Cup qualifying match on voodoo  &mdash;  with help from a U.S-based electronics chain. An advertisement in the sports daily Record on Tuesday invited fans to clip coupons and redeem them at their local Radio Shack store for a voodoo-doll likeness of a U.S. player. The hope was that a little black magic might help Mexico break a decade of futility on the road versus its northern neighbor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An illustration showed a pair of scissors slicing off the leg of a doll in a U.S. jersey that was bruised, crying out in pain, leaking stuffing, and stuck with pushpins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniel Paz, marketing manager for the newspaper, told The Associated Press the promotion was a lighthearted attempt to make next month&rsquo;s rivalry game more enjoyable for fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a toy,&#8221; Paz said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no intention of being anything serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Record said it has created 10,000 dolls and plans to expand the promotion to include effigies representing the other CONCACAF finalists: Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago.<br>

			<p>I actually thought voodoo was more of a black animist thing, not Chicano Hispanics.</p>
<p>If all else fails, then Mexico will have to turn to their plan of last resort   &mdash;   have better players.</p>

			<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re paying the U.S. an unintended compliment. Doesn&rsquo;t implying that they have to turn to voodoo in order for them to have any chance of winning make them look kind of pathetic? Besides, I thought our great biracial president was supposed to make the U.S. beloved around the world?</p>

			<p>Mexico is playing the US in Columbus on February 11? Any Mexican fans that watch this one won&rsquo;t be doing too much dancing and partying. They will wonder how whites survive in this climate.-</p>

			<p>As an avid soccer fan, I can tell you that my favorite soccer match was still the USA vs MEX world cup match of 2002. The Mexicans were furious and cheating left and right &hellip; their egos couldn&rsquo;t handle the fact that USA beat them at their own game.</p>
<p>Practice voodoo all they like, but they&rsquo;ll still get trounced in 2010.</p>

			<p>We should all fully support this development! Why should it stop with soccer?</p>
<p> I hope all illegal Mexican immigrants adopt such a strong distaste for the United States that they leave and never wish to return. </p>

			<p>This is a funny story. It is a bit funny. Then I&rsquo;m reminded these same newspapers wouldn&rsquo;t accept a paid-ad simply announcing the day and time Jared Taylor was giving a campus speech - then had the nerve to go on about their herculean commitment to free speech.</p>
<p>When &#8216;Mexican Americans&rsquo; boo the US team again, I wonder if it&rsquo;s going to be featured in their coverage?</p>

<p>I believe there is an archived AmRen article describing a dark force Hispanics make offerings to in return for tangible benefits. I find it interesting that the colored folk of the world turn to evil to tip the balance in their favor. <br>

<p>No, Vodoo is a spanish thing as well. In the Carribian, it&rsquo;s known as Santa Rea - combination of Afro-Carrib-Christian religions rolled into voodoo/black magic.</p>
<p>The reason for the mixture of Christianity was that when the White man would ride out into the fields a night and see the saints pictures being displayed, he wouldn&rsquo;t beat the slaves. He&rsquo;d think they were getting all worked up over Christianity and not voodoo.</p>

<p>I often see dead roosters nailed to telephone poles and street signs in hispanic areas of Chicago. I assume they are some kind of witchcraft.  There are plenty of Botanicas that sell a lot more than Christian saints candles and Yerba mate.</p>

			<p>Let our Hispanic amigos rely on their Voodoo, Hoodoo, Uoodoo, or any other doo. Our snake handling, foot washing, slain in the spirit, talking in tongues, exorcising, charismatic television evangelists will put the most feared of all, yes kiddies and kiddos, I&rsquo;m speaking of none other than that seven generation doomsday curse on these infidels for all of their manipulating, squirming,  blaspheming, and profaning [while doing the devil&rsquo;s work I might add]. If that doesn&rsquo;t counteract a few pins and needles I&rsquo;ve still got my ouija board, my Ray Stevens &#8220;Sittin up with the dead&#8221; CD&rsquo;s, and my complete Harry Potter. </p>
<p>Lets get it on!</p>
