<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Waiting outside the locked steel doors at King County juvenile detention, Margie Parks watched Barack Obama sworn in as president and thought of her son, one among dozens of black youths incarcerated a few yards away.</p>
<p>She had no way of knowing that her boy, 15, was also watching, along with every other detainee  &mdash;  kids locked up for robbery, assault, drug crimes and homicide  &mdash;  most of them minorities wondering if the ascendance of the nation&rsquo;s first black president would mean anything to their lives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portia, 15, was excited mainly by her belief that the new commander in chief will commute drug charges from felony to misdemeanor status, enabling her to get a job and apply for college scholarships. Gary, also 15, thought Obama might be able to do something about the way police deal with young people of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is changing, and I&rsquo;m really trying to change &#8221; said Jonathan, 16, a member of the South Side Criminals, a Latino set. &#8220;Because this is like my 16th time coming in here, and all the things I&rsquo;ve been doing outside isn&rsquo;t doing me no good. I got to grow up, get my GED, a job, a house because I want to live the American dream. That&rsquo;s what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lee Davis, a supervisor, was almost speechless after Obama&rsquo;s address. His great-grandmother had been a slave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Social studies teacher Diane Benson plans to dissect the new president&rsquo;s speech as a vocabulary lesson. In class after Obama had finished his address, she spoke to a group of 27  &mdash;  many of whom consider themselves far more likely to become gang soldiers than constitutional scholars  &mdash;  about inclusion and tolerance.</p>
<p>The new president, she noted, had chosen a conservative minister, the Rev. Rick Warren, to give the invocation, despite their differences on a number of issues. He had worn a bright-red tie, symbolic, she believes, of his reaching out to red, traditionally Republican states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jonathan, slumped in his county-issued blue jumpsuit, struggling to extricate himself from gang life, nodded quietly.<br>

<p>When the black thugs mug somebody, then run away a cop grabs the by the collar and slams them to the ground, and they want to put as stop to that kind of police brutality to people of color.</p>
<p>They love to include other &#8220;People of color&#8221; who they want everyone to believe are on their side, but real life proves blacks are regarded in a worse light by the other races, generally.</p>

			<p>Did Martin Luther King JR inspire black youth? Did black history month inspire black youth? Did Garvey or X or Spike Lee or Chris Rock or Bill Cosby inspire black youth?</p>
<p>Who is the magic black man who is going to inspire black youth to change their lives? Most black youth find their inspiration from gangsta rappers not politicians. Since past is prologue, it&rsquo;s a safe bet Obama isn&rsquo;t going to inspire anyone.</p>
<p>Just more words chasing a dream.</p>

<p>Good luck there Comrade Benson, good luck indeed!</p>
<p>How will rhapsodizing about &#8220;inclusion and tolerance&#8221; with a pack of wannabe &#8220;gangstas,&#8221; turn their utterly worthless lives around? It won&rsquo;t; it will have no more impact on them, then will the USA having a mulatto president who chants mantra-like about &#8220;hope and change,&#8221; miraculously turn this country&rsquo;s (or the world&rsquo;s, for that matter)economy around. </p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t going to happen; if these delinquent street urchins are to be saved, they can only do it through their own free will. You Comrade Benson are nothing more than a &#8220;caretaker&#8221; of vultures at best. If you even reach so much as one out of a hundred, consider yourself beyond lucky. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>I heard a comment on NPR tonight  by a young white gal that was teaching in an inner city school, how excited she was that &#8216;the (black) boys were all out waiting for the bus&rsquo; after not doing so for weeks..the subtext being that &#8216;Obama&rsquo; inspired them to give up truancy and begin a new life&rsquo;..any AMRN readers want to start making bets about how long it will be before the blacks toss Barack under the bus? </p>

			<p>Howe about a big poster of NelsonMandela in te Uncle Sam pose saying &#8220;Africa needs yiou (as long as you are black)  Come and join us.&#8221;    Inspire your amoral youth, in this case the African Americans, to go back to their roots, especially if they have usable qualifications.   But as an African American (from Houston) said to me in 1997 during a visit to South Africa where then I lived, he hoped to drum up business but he admittd to me that his color was expected to be a big advantage, but he discovred that he could not figure the African blacks out, everyone (black people) wanted big bribes and did not seem to know their jobs.   He was amazed to find that they were not as he expected. If only the world had listened properly and intelligently to the old white governments  (SA and Rhodesia) when they explained the same.  The historical evidence was there in Africa already to prove the facts.</p>

			<p>Two points:</p>
<p>(1)  They&rsquo;re all there on state juvenile charges.  Only the state&rsquo;s Governor can issue pardons or commutations on state charges.  The President can only do these things on Federal charges or convictions.</p>
<p>(2)  They&rsquo;re in King County, WA.  Originally, it was named after Franklin Pierce&rsquo;s Vice-President, last name King.  A few years ago, the county changed its official name inspiration to Martin Luther King.  Wasn&rsquo;t that supposed to make black &#8220;yoots&#8221; behave?</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re telling the TRUTH!</p>
<p>AfricanAmerican.GrantKit.org </p>
<p>&#8220;Billions of Dollars are given away every month by the Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so happy today, that I have finally found a grant program which really works. Thanks to Grant Funding Solutions they showed me how to get FREE money from the government! I got $15,000 to help pay off medical bills and credit cards. How much will you get?</p>
<p>Blacks voting themselves FREE money; just like they said on vdare.com: &#8220;RACIAL SOCIALISM.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Only slightly off topic, but still pertaining to BO (as I like to call him.  Of course, we all know what BO USED to mean when we were children. Given the Society that is quickly being created around this man I think he is aptly initialed).</p>
<p>In any event, I think some might take some comfort from this article. Particularly the first paragraph.</p>

			<p>Why do blacks need a leader and someone to be &#8220;inspired by&#8221;?  Look at the Germans.  They had a man that &#8220;inspired&#8221; them and claimed to be their &#8220;leaders&#8221; back in the 30s and 40s. What happened to him???</p>

			<p>Believing these juvenile delinquents will be inspired enough to &#8220;go straight&#8221; and become productive citizens&hellip; is like believing millions of Black Africans won&rsquo;t try to invade European countries to become festering problems in White societies. Becoming life-long welfare burdens and a constant source of crime and problems to their White neighbors.</p>

			<p>Once again, Obama is half-white.</p>
<p>Rick Warren defended Brian Nichols (Atlanta courthouse killer who escaped the death penalty, thanks to a jury with 8 blacks), and Obama sided with the Jena 6 and the L.A. rioters, so they have that much in common.</p>

			<p>Rev. Rick Warren is not conservative. Sure he doesn&rsquo;t like abortion and believes in God, but his conservatism ends there.  The most prominent white chiristian leaders (not just the black ones) are part of the problem and not the solution. Even Billy Graham once said that he wished there were more interacial couples. Given that most Amreners are conservative, they are also most likely Christianity. Please take note, however, that the destructive ideals we stand against have their root in Christianity&hellip;equality, &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; (as minorities are taking over your country), love your enemies, and the generally muliticultural &#8220;we all God&rsquo;s children&#8221; rhetoric that comes from most Christians these days. This is one of the main reasons Americans, including conservative Americans, cannot confront the problems are nation faces. And even when they are knowledged, most don&rsquo;t have the balls to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Yes, but that still leaves him on the right side of the black-folks bell curve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that comment was as stupid as you make it out to be.  It&rsquo;s actually a methaphorical way of describing most middle-class blacks.  After all, that&rsquo;s what affirmative action effectively is.  For example, a Black high school teacher, who if white would be qualified to be a janitor, will easily make that over the course of a career.</p>

			<p>Always comes back to the beginning of the circle, doesn&rsquo;t it? The bleak reality AFRICA, but for the influence of White Europeans, would be only marginally more advanced than it was&hellip; around 2,500 B.C.! If Blackness were truly good, WHY are millions of Africans risking everything to swarm into the White European nations&hellip; if not for the free ride they expect, once there?</p>
<p>Borrowing that ridiculous History Channel scenario: &#8220;What if there were no more Humans?&#8221;, we can turn it around: &#8220;What if there were no more WHITE HUMANS?&#8221; I suggest it would take, at best only two centuries for the planet to regress 600 years or more. Populated by squabbling, fighting tribalistic societies. The knowledge amassed by the Whites all but forgotten. Machinery and the skill to use and repair it&hellip; lost forever.</p>
<p>The Asians (Chinese and Japanese) probably would fare far better than Latinos, and certainly many times better than Blacks. Would become the ruling class, enslaving Blacks, as convenient. But still, Orientals were never much famed for original thought&hellip; being far better at copying (reverse-engineering) than inventing. So the Chinese and Japanese would also regress, but at a somewhat slower rate.</p>

			<p>Anonymous, anyone who says we are all God&rsquo;s children is very likely not Christian. The Bible teaches that only those who believe in Christ as Lord and Savior are saved and therefore God&rsquo;s children.</p>
