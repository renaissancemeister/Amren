			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Delores McCain, New Austin Weekly News (Oak Park, Illinois), January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CP, 14: &#8220;The affect it has on me is that most black people are treated like they are nothing and they are not worth anything in their life. But with a black president I think he can change all of that, not just for black males but for everybody in the United States. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>NB, 15: &#8220;{snip} It makes me believe I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.&#8221;</p>
<p>MP, 19: &#8220;It has given me a better dream in life and given me hope that I can be something in life. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>DC, 13: &#8220;{snip} I think it will be a good thing to inspire most young people to make sure they become something in their life. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>JM, 19: &#8220;I believe that the affect on the African-American young man will make more of them grow up to become more responsible. They will say &#8216;Man, if this dude can do it and he is from Chicago like me, from the South Side, why can&rsquo;t I do it?&rsquo; {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>PB, 16: &#8220;{snip} So many young black males, where they come from, don&rsquo;t believe they can make it anywhere but he gives them hope and a chance to believe in themselves and to be respectful.&#8221;<br>

			<p>What effect will a Black president have on youths? They&rsquo;ll probably get the idea now they can get away with murder. More likely than not, they&rsquo;ll be inspired enough to start a new crime wave, given the mentality of the average inner-city Black.</p>

			<p>For every one black man that will think &#8220;If Obama can do it why can&rsquo;t I?,&#8221; there will be ten who become regressively more arrogant and hateful towards whites, because the Obama coronation signals to them that &#8220;they&rsquo;z takin over.&#8221;</p>

			<p>    &lsquo;Man, if this dude can do it, why can&rsquo;t I do it?&rsquo; </p>
<p><br>
Because you and he have nothing in common.  Nothing (beyond some brown skin).   Nothing.</p>
<p>Do you have a supportive white family to raise you, give you all the best they can, and put you through school?  Do you have white billionaires (like Pritzger and Soros) to finance and promote you?</p>
<p>If not,  you have NOTHING in common!</p>
<p>PS. He&rsquo;s not &#8220;from&#8221; Chicago like you.   He went &#8220;to&#8221; Chicago not &#8220;from&#8221; Chicago, which was after he already had his Harvard and Colombia degrees; not to mention prominent sponsors on the Harvard faculty and in the Chicago legal world.  He&rsquo;s their creation.  Obama was picked and promoted; they MADE him into what he is.</p>

			<p>What effect will it have on young blacks? Absolutely none, except to think that they can work white guilt even more effectively than they have in the past.</p>
<p>After all, compared to most parts of Africa, most blacks, enjoying the benefits of central heating, electricity, and running water, not to mention iPods, television, automobiles, libraries, a guaranteed education, at least to the degree to which they are willing to apply themselves, etc. have it vastly better than most who are living in Africa. Does that satisfy them? No, they are always going on about slavery and racism, comparing themselves to whites and complaining that any difference in achievement is due to racism. What difference in all that will a &#8220;black&#8221; president make?</p>

			<p>In the days following the election, my wife and ate brunch at IHOP. There were two Black servers in the establishment and the rest were White. The Blacks had an extra spring in their step and were extra polite and expedient with orders, almost to the point of being obsequious. But I could tell that they were sincerely happy. I noticed the same thing across town for the next week or so.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe what happens when they come to realize their lives will not change one iota. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hope&#8221;, &#8220;promise&#8221;, &#8220;yes we can&#8221;, and similar pretense are not substitutes for good decision-making, intelligence, and actions that culminate in positive outcomes.</p>

			<p>I can hardly wait until Tuesday!</p>
<p>Finally, we can all come together as a people!  Once and for all, we will have put racial division behind us, and be ready to move forward as a nation!</p>
<p>The new-found self-respect and personal initiative Barack&rsquo;s election has given black Americans will mean no more need for affirmative action, racial quotas or minority set-asides!  Crime in the inner city will be a thing of the past, and millions of people will eagerly move off the welfare rolls and into gainful employment!</p>
<p>Bach and Chopin will replace Tupac and Beyonce on urban radio stations!  The PSAT scores at inner city schools will soar, and babies will stop having babies.  Blacks will never again complain when the police pull them over, or they get passed over for a promotion at work.  </p>
<p>Yes, this is change I can believe in!</p>

			<p>What happens when Tyrone and Latrametrius figure out that not everyone has the ability to improve themselves intellectually?  As we know, black IQ is relatively low compared to other Americans, so what will happen once they take out huge loans and try to be a doctor, engineer, or astrophysicist; but fail miserably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken quite a few advanced mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science classes that have had the &#8220;token black&#8221; in them, and it is almost painful to watch and listen to them complain about how unfair they are, because they are too difficult for their remedial minds.  Never once have I seen the same black in two advanced classes in a row (ie: Mechanics310 followed by Mechatronics315).  At some point they all hit an intellectual wall.</p>
<p>Are we expected to lower the bar even further now that BHO is going to be President? </p>

			<p>The comments they make are absurd. obama didn&rsquo;t do anything. That&rsquo;s what makes this whole scene so absolutely mind blowing. He is a product of the media and those liberal elites in power looking for redemption for their perceived white privilege. They can&rsquo;t do it without their power.</p>

			<p>This is such complete nonsense it is laughable! What tangible impact have Black Secretaries of State, Chairmen Of The Joint Chiefs, Attornies General, Congressmen, etc., made upon young urban Blacks? Now because one half-black, smooth-talking character is elected president in what can best be described as an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; type campaign, we are to believe all these inner-city &#8220;youths&#8221; are prepared to walk the straight and narrow?!? </p>

			<p>It will have the same effect that it has had on blacks in every other formerly white controlled country that has come under black power (haiti, zimbabwe, SA etc.)  What little opportunity and capacity for humanity these blacks had will evaporate.  Within a generation, the social institutions will crumble and a state of barbarism will develop&hellip;.unchecked by white law.</p>
<p>Soon after, 90% of those blacks will starve to death as white welfare disappears.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Man, if this dude can do it, why can&rsquo;t I do it?&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, anything that would improve black attitudes in large numbers I think is a good thing. But I just seriously doubt Obama is going to make one iota of difference to black males of any age.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like having to mention it, but doesn&rsquo;t it do more harm than good for a group of black males who will average really low I.Q.&rsquo;s to pursue goals that are above their abilities?  I mean the liberal mantra that blacks can compete in any field puts them in a rage when they reach too high and fall well short of competence in whatever they attempt that is above their pay grade.  In the final analysis they are more discouraged than ever, because they reached too high instead of lowering their goals to a more realistic level.</p>
<p>And, in the end, they will repeat what their leaders and white liberals tell them, which is that they failed because of white racism. </p>

<p>Of course in this day and age, these &#8220;strengths&#8221;, combined with affirmative action, can take a person to the White House.  And these youngsters weren&rsquo;t even reading from a teleprompter!</p>

			<p>Some of the negative &#8216;new age&rsquo; immoral lessons Obama&rsquo;s Presidency is subtly teaching the young are:<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
-White girls impregnated by &#8216;any non-white&rsquo; could potentially become President.(A Kenyan for goodness sake)<br>
-Blacks boys do not need a biological father present in their lives to potentially be President.(I&rsquo;m the grown offspring of a Divorcee, surely I&rsquo;m proof that your parents choice(s) in mate(s) can screw you up).<br>
-Being a good orator trumps service and experience.(Image, famous friends and &#8216;having the gift of the gab&rsquo; trumps substance see preachers, freestyle rappers etc. for other examples).<br>
-Blacks are beyond criticism.(See his senate voting record-&#8216;present&rsquo; 100 times, Rev Wright 20 year spiritual mentor, Mrs Obama&rsquo;s comments <br>
 <a href="https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=xMlOKvTZcqM" rel="nofollow">https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=xMlOKvTZcqM</a> &hellip;etc. and so on)<br>
-Ask what the country will do for you?(Only participate and show interest if there is something in it for you).<br>
-A genetic African was chosen to be the most powerful &#8216;MAN&rsquo; on earth.(Race matters).</p>
<p>Some of the negative things Obama&rsquo;s nomination is subtly showing the world:<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
-&#8216;The West is up for grabs&rsquo;.(Whites build Western nations making the framework and infrastructure, simply readying for it for it&rsquo;s non white tenants).<br>
-We forgive and forget Muslims very quickly.<br>
(One nations maturity in overcoming Muslim Prejudice from 9/11 in electing someone with three Muslim names, is another nations idea of weakness).</p>
<p>Some positives for white nationalists:<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
-The tradition elitist candidate profile has been redefined which is not all bad i.e. it opens the door for a white female to reinvigorate our people or perhaps other non traditional white males.<br>
-46% of the US voters who turned up to the polls inspite of the GOP did not get their preferred candidate.(&#8216;You can lead a horse to water&rsquo; or &#8216;you can fool some of the people most of time&rsquo;).<br>
-More whites will &#8216;wake up&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are many more examples in each category of course&hellip;..<br>

			<p>Note to blacks: the US has only one president at a time, and that president may be in office for as long as eight years. You&rsquo;d be well advised to have some other set of employable skills. Being President would be fun and all, but don&rsquo;t count on it.</p>

Obamas presidency will have the same affect that our black mayor, black chief of police, black school superintendent, and black majority school have had on the black youth of Buffalo.</p>
<p>The ideas of &#8216;black leaders&rsquo; and &#8216;black role models&rsquo; changing the lives of black youth is yet another false hope and pipe dream of the black community.</p>

			<p>BE CAREFUL! <br>
I had a young black man dressed in his hip hop gear show up on my doorstep(90% white neighborhood) and was claiming to be selling subscriptions and said &#8220;Vote for me&#8221; and held his head up high. All the while he was asking me questions like..what I did for a living and opened my screen door without an invitation. I came this close to clocking him with a baseball bat I had my hand on close by.When I assessed the right time to do so,I instaed took my camera (close by also) and asked the future president to smile nicely for the camera, then I kicked him off my property.Anyway, the moral of the story is:they have no morals! The blacks now have a higher confidence, a misguided one, and feel they can go where no man has gone before. Be aware of this.</p>

			<p>Already I have sensed a change in young black attitude since God, er, Obama was elected. An overall increase in gall, sarcastic superiority and a more flamboyant, in-your-face attitude of not giving a flying fig what others think. As if any of this is possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d leave MLK off that &#8220;morally responsible list if I were you.</p>
<p>If we had known that President Elect Obama would cause such an Epiphany among young Black males we could have gotten him in sooner. Maybe four of the Wichita victims would still be alive along with Channon Christian &amp; Christopher Newsome, EVe Carson, Lauren Burk and God knows how many others. <br>
There is nothing that will change them. I look at Michael Nutter of Philadelphia and I see a tired, almost broken man already.  He sometimes has that &#8220;What was I thinking?&#8221; look. I really don&rsquo;t see him seeking a second term as Mayor. He is a positive role model for Blacks in Philly but it doesn&rsquo;t mean a damned thing.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that blacks have been a little less bothersome, had a little less attitude, since Obama&rsquo;s election. A friend of mine thinks she&rsquo;s noticed the same.</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed such a change?</p>

			<p>Hmmm.  I guess the young blacks in my city never got the word of this &#8216;hope&rsquo;.  We receive BOLO (Be On the Look Out) messages on our car computers whenever a crime is committed and a description of the perpetrator is known.  Though the area is fairly diverse between whites, blacks, and hispanics, blacks tend to be mentioned in these BOLO messages at extremely disproportionate numbers compared to whites.  Blacks are mentioned over hispanics at nearly a 3-to-1 clip, even though there are more hispanics than blacks or whites.  Blacks are especially overrepresented in violent crimes such as robberies and carjackings.  Granted, hispanics do their fair share of violent crimes as well, and whites even do a very small amount of these crimes. but nowhere close to the numbers that blacks commit them.  In my area, of every 100 violent crimes committed, my observation would be that approximately 70% are committed by blacks, 25% by hispanics, and the remaining 5% committed by whites and others combined. <br>
  <br>
Another thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that blacks rarely commit their violent crimes alone.  A rough estimate would be that when a violent crime is mentioned in these BOLO messages, 4 out of 5 of these crimes are committed by two or more blacks working together and they almost always display guns in the commission of their crimes.</p>
<p>These BOLO messages mentioning black perpetrators have not subsided a bit since November 4th, and I have serious doubt that this will change over the next four years.  Though Barack Obama as vowed change, one thing he will not be able to change is genetics.</p>

			<p>Blacks everywhere have a tribal mentality like their cousins back in Africa.  We saw what that tribe mentality was like during the three month genocide between the Hutus and Tutsis.  Many blacks will now have the attitude that their &#8220;tribe&#8221; is in charge and therefore they make the rules and whether to follow them or not.  If Obama fails as president, you can bet they will blame whites, believing whites did everything they could to undermine Obama.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After all, compared to most parts of Africa, most blacks&hellip;have it vastly better than most who are living in Africa.&#8221; - Tim in Indiana</p>
<p>Like I always asked: exactly how many blacks, from 1865-2008, emigrated from the USA to a majority black country to escape oppression?  (Or, how many South African blacks, during Apartheid, emigrated to black-run African nations?)   Blacks agree with you in their deeds, if not their words.</p>

<p>My husband refers to it as Mayor Nutter&rsquo;s &#8220;deer-in-the-headlights&#8221; expression and we first noticed it the day he took office. Nutter DOES look absolutely overwhelmed and we&rsquo;d also be surprised if he seeks a second term in office.</p>

			<p>To those suggesting &#8220;lowering the bar&#8221; with respect to education, to professional standards, I say &#8220;by all means. Let&rsquo;s do it!&#8221; Graduate Black physicians if they can get at least 10% of the answers right in a test. Then allow them to ONLY TREAT BLACK PATIENTS! Then step back and see how many patients they attract to their practice.</p>

			<p>Similar things were said when Detroit elected it&rsquo;s first Black mayor - supposedly crime and racial resentments that led up to the riot would be overcome as Black youths saw one of their making it in the system&hellip;.</p>
<p>40 years later, Detroit still has Black mayors and 80% of the White population has fled, Bvlack criminality, welfare dependency is as bad as ever - but Blacks still want more political representations, their &#8220;eyes on the prize&#8221; are eyeing getting more power in Whiter suburbs.</p>
<p>Same thing happened in New York City with the election of David Dinkins - like Barack Dinkins was well mannered, educated had to make great strides to prove he was &#8220;Black enough&#8221;. </p>
<p>The election of Dinkins was supposed to heal race relations, show Blacks who had dropped out to get back in, get an education same stuff we hear from Obama.</p>
<p>The Dinkins years were the worst ever for New York, he flies around the world to go to South Africa, make statements, the city goes down, down, down, Dinkins even held back the police as Black criminal mobs went on an anti Jewish pogrom in Crown Heights. That was the final straw, New Yorkers, including Jewish New Yorkers voted in Guliani on a &#8220;take back the city&#8221; platform, the White NYPD was empowered to end Black crime, street anarchy, everything destructive and hostile that Blacks, NW do.</p>
<p>So Amren, America - lets start looking for that tough law and order Pres candidate to come in and set things straight after a one term Obamanation. And folks, some 80 Libertarian talking about less government more personal responsibility, return to the CONSTITUTION, FAMILY VALUES - this isn&rsquo;t going to do it.</p>

Exactly what I experienced. Except it was a 99.9 neighborhood in my case and extremely,ahem! I mean extremely! financialy solvent. Now yesterday, I heard neighbors talking about a woman that was strangled at home a few streets away. Almost makes me wish I still read the paper cause it must have been in there.  I asked my spouse how she feels now about a guy who just wants to stay home all day online&hellip; I also warned her against any kind of false alarm on our system as I have a feeling cops will be showing up before you can get the bathrobe on. And finally, my door knocker threw in a verbal barb about change coming after I asked him to leave rather forcefully without explaining his business at my front door. I have told my soft hearted girl OVER and OVER that this is where the money is, expect an avalanche!!</p>

			<p>It is possible for President Obama to inspire black youth. He needs to get that Cadillac pimped out and start wearing more bling,use more drugs, get arrested and start useing the &#8220;F&#8221; word in every sentence. If he continues to wear a suit and speak in correct english he will only be acting white. </p>
<p>Blacks are already aware that you can get ahead in life by obeying the rules and getting an education but what they can&rsquo;t figure out is how to become president without finishing high school. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry in most African countries they do figure it out sooner or latter. Just shoot that &#8220;MF&#8221; and take his job. Requires a lot less effort than going to school and doesn&rsquo;t interfere with one&rsquo;s life style. </p>

			<p>Just curious but WHAT would explain the dysfunctional, sociopathic tendencies and predisposition to failure and crime among urban Blacks? Yeah, I know sociology experts (sociology being about as valid and worthwhile as astrology) would blame it on a century and a half of slavery, another century of discrimination&hellip; but then again, how could the sociology experts&rsquo; pet theory account for the similar behavioral patterns of Blacks in African nations, or those Blacks who immigrated into White European nations? Sorry, but I seriously doubt Obama&rsquo;s presidency will have ANY positive role model effect on Blacks, anywhere in the world!</p>

<p>Hey, friend Anonymous, what&rsquo;s your professional perspective on which racial group is ahead, respect to crime? Blacks or [illegal] Mexican immigrants? I could be wrong but believe it&rsquo;s an even split between the two racial groups. Inasmuch as Blacks are outnumbered at better than two-to-one by Hispanics, population-wise, the Blacks do work harder to reach parity, at least insofar as commission of crimes.</p>

			<p>   I think many liberal whites desperately hope that a President Obama will serve as a role-model-in-chief for troubled black youth. While a some bright blacks might be inspired by Barak Obama, I&rsquo;m afraid Ghetto youth will not be inspired into becoming productive citizens. The old cliché about making a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear applies.</p>

			<p>I am praying for the next 4 years to be a successful 4 years for the entire country.  I am praying that we are not attacked. BUT, I am not optimistic.  </p>
<p>I see PEBO&rsquo;s election as a serious turning point for this country into black rule.  Just the other day, Tavis Smiley, said that &#8220;Barrack Obama&rsquo;s election is ONLY (my emphasis) a downpayment on Martin Luther King&rsquo;s dream.&#8221;  A downpayment?  </p>
<p>This just goes to prove what my father told us 40 years ago, that the blacks in this country are never going to be satisfied until every government job, every political office, every CEO, every police officer, every mayor, every governor is an African American. In others, they want it all.  </p>

			<p>To those of you who have had the street thugs casing your house via the front door: May I suggest a large dog (Doberman, German Shepherd, Rottweiler)? Most blacks cross the street AWAY from me when I&rsquo;m walking mine around the neighborhood, even though mine are well trained and socialized. They would find a lost child if needed, or sleep at the foot of your bed. And my teenage daughter can be left at home while I run to the store for a minute, and nobody is getting past them.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the future holds, but with Obamas election you may see more &#8220;respectable&#8221; Black men appearing in high profile positions. The media will of course play into this and continue to show Blacks achieving and supposedly succeeding. Many whites will be fooled and think that the Black man has finally arrived and all those genetic &#8220;myths&#8221; can finally be put to rest. It will be important for whites not get fooled into thinking these Black men are capable. I was almost fooled into thinking Obama was more intelligent than he is. Everytime I investigate a Black man who is supposedly intelligent, I always find this is not the case. Behind the suit and tie, behind the polished exterior is a man of below average intelligence who talks a good game and has been helped by his minority status. </p>

<p>The short list of ingredients for success would be:</p>
<p>1.  Wealthy white grandparents willing to raise the illegitimate mulatto their daughter has produced, instead of disowning her.</p>
<p>2.  A lifetime of Affirmative Action giveaways that guarantee you access to education and jobs while denying the same to more qualified people merely because they happen to be white.</p>
<p>3.  A mainstream media with a pronounced liberal bias that gushes over you without asking for precise details about your vague promises of &#8220;change&#8221;.</p>
<p>4.  An election opponant who does not seem to know exactly why he wants to be President and who pulls his punches in a campaign that can chartiably be described as &#8220;deliberately mishandled&#8221;.</p>
<p>5.  A federal court that does not care whether you are able or willing to produce a US birth certificate.</p>

<p>You just described the black middle class of the Washington DC area. Scarily, they are the ones you also find as upper and middle level civil servants in every level of government. Very polished, with nice suits and german automobiles.If however, they see a white woman with a large posterior, it is if they never left the ghetto at all.</p>

			<p> I work in Chicago, in the gold coast, which is the nicest area of town. However, you see tons of blacks hanging out, reason one because the metra train station that goes to chicago&rsquo;s trashy Indiana-side neighborhoods drops them off there, and because there are quite a few debt collection services there. Since Nov. 4th I have definitely noticed these unproductive members of society having much more gall and cockiness. If you&rsquo;re both walking on a sidewalk in opposite directions, they will intentionally step over so they will put themselves in your way, then expect you to move, and since I don&rsquo;t move for people who aren&rsquo;t even fit to clean my toilets, they walk right into me and think nothing of bumping into me or giving me a shove, which usually earns them my spit landing on them or a nice name-calling to put them back in their place. The next day the same people will come up to me, with no recollection, asking me for &#8220;two dollah for da bus&#8221; or &#8220;for a smoke man.&#8221; I have never had problems with them until Nov 4th. Now, they seek out ways to get in your way or in your face, their entitlement issues have gone through the roof and they are becoming increasingly violent. They are like the triffids from that science fiction novella. </p>

<p>Right you are. Dinkins should have been charged with negligence in the deaths of both Yankel Rosenbaum stabbed to death by one Lemrick Nelson who was exhorting fellow Blacks to &#8220;kill the Jews&#8221; and of Vincent Graziosi who, while stopped at a red light, was shot to death because he had a beard and was supposedly mistaken for an Hassidic. I don&rsquo;t think that Mr. Graziosi&rsquo;s killers were ever apprehended. Nelson, who was acquitted by an all black jury nullification, took all the jurors to lunch after the verdict.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic, it&rsquo;s my nature.  I expect that one happy result of Obama&rsquo;s presidency will be that blacks will appear more inane when they protest that they live in a terribly racist country where the whole system and &#8220;Da Man&#8221; is all arrayed against them and where, since everybody is racist and won&rsquo;t let them get anywhere, therefore they have no choice but to sit on their behinds and hold out their hands and demand handouts and payouts. These types of complaints will seem more and more disconnected with reality.  Prominent blacks will continue to succeed, Obama&rsquo;s intelligence and integrity will radiate, and this will all be so much unwanted brilliant sunshine for those who can only make sense of their world if it is composed of trash and violence, dimness, and various fantasized forces purportedly arrayed against them, all of which in reality just exist in their own distorted psyches.  It will ( I hope) become ever more obvious that the reason the black underclass is not getting anywhere positive is because people of the black underclass do not want to get anywhere positive.  I have no idea whether it is true or not that blacks have a lower IQ than other races: if it is, then surely this doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t work, because there are plenty of jobs that don&rsquo;t require brilliance.  What any job requires for success, though, is a positive attitude and commitment, and these can come from people with any level of intelligence.  If we as a society stop codependently enabling blacks to continue to blame others for their own failure, they are more likely to experience the type of social shaming and other pressures that will help them see that their futures lie in their own hands, and see them get off their butts and start making some effort.  When Obama says, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t just pour education in someone&rsquo;s ear&#8221; he is already showing signs of departing in a wonderful way from dimwitty liberal policies that seem to think that the individual has to make no effort at all, but all responsibility for a person&rsquo;s success lies with the social system in which they live.  Obama is in more than one way showing the intelligence to see through that seriously unbalanced liberal thinking.     </p>

			<p> A man apparently tried to pass a $360 billion check, which he said his girlfriend&rsquo;s mother gave him to start a record business, last April,in Fort Worth, TX. Charles Ray Fuller, 21, of Crowley, was arrested on an accusation of forgery. The personal check was not made out to Mr. Fuller. When the bank contacted the check owner, the woman said she did not write a check for $360 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller was also accused of unlawful carrying of a weapon and possession of marijuana&hellip;.. </p>
<p>Now, this is a black man who felt VERY entitled!!</p>

He went &ldquo;to&rdquo; Chicago not &ldquo;from&rdquo; Chicago, which was after he already had his Harvard and Colombia degrees; not to mention prominent sponsors on the Harvard faculty and in the Chicago legal world.
