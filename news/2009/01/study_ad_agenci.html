<h1><a href="https://adage.com/article?article_id=133638">Study: Ad Agencies Exhibit &#8216;Pervasive Racial Discrimination&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marissa Miley and Ken Wheaton, Ad Age, January 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ad industry doesn&rsquo;t simply have a diversity problem. According to Cyrus Mehri&rsquo;s Madison Avenue Project, it is guilty of &#8220;pervasive racial discrimination&#8221; that not only underhires and segregates African-Americans but pays them 80 cents for every dollar it pays comparable white employees. With current efforts to bridge the gap doing little more than &#8220;blaming the victims,&#8221; Mr. Mehri and the NAACP are laying the groundwork for a possible class-action suit against the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NAACP and my firm are joining forces to take on the advertising industry to end the long era of purposeful discrimination,&#8221; Mr. Mehri said in New York today, where he, NAACP Interim General Counsel Angela Ciccolo, activist Sanford Moore and economists Marc Bendick and Mary Lou Egan held a press conference. The industry, Mr. Mehri continued, &#8220;has robbed the African-American community of equal opportunity, good positions and, most important, their dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Mehri&rsquo;s civil-rights firm, Mehri &amp; Skalet, specializes in class-action cases, including successful discrimination cases against Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Co. and Texaco. {snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Tried to get people to listen&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While that may seem like hyperbole to some, the study, authored by Mr. Bendick and Ms. Egan, offers some startling findings:</p>
<p>* Black college graduates in advertising earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by their white counterparts.</p>
<p>* The total U.S. population is 12.8% African-American. Blacks should represent 9.6% of advertising professionals and managers, according to U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission estimates. But actual representation falls dramatically short of that expectation  &mdash;  about 55% short.</p>
<p>* Blacks are only 10% as likely as their white counterparts to hold a position that pays $100,000 or more per year.</p>
<p>* Compared with the overall U.S. labor market, the advertising industry fares significantly worse on eight measures of employment for black managers and professionals  &mdash;  by an average of 36.7%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Efforts have been made</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Sanford Moore] has particular disdain for chief diversity officers. &#8220;Diversity executives and diversity consultants are diversity pimps. The only thing that&rsquo;s diversified are their bank accounts,&#8221; Mr. Moore said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re put there as window dressing. And window dressing gets taken down after the holidays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bendick and Ms. Egan, on the other hand, said such positions can be very useful  &mdash;  if the executives report to CEOs and the CEOs have the will to diversify their agencies. But they both added that if there is no commitment at the highest levels of the agency, the role is indeed window dressing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Couldn&rsquo;t come at a worse time&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, it couldn&rsquo;t come at a worse time,&#8221; he said via e-mail. &#8220;How much can be done to encourage new [minority] hiring when many firms are laying off experienced people of all racial and ethnic persuasions?&#8221; Mr. Chambers said in order to bring about change in the industry, holding companies and agencies need to have a &#8220;consistent commitment to funding and encouraging minority participation&#8221; over the long-term. At a minimum, he said, this should be done for a decade, &#8220;not one to two years with an occasional report to a body whose leadership and focus changes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>  The percentage of ad executives who are black far exceeds the percentage of available black college graduates when compared to the same percentages of whites. A lower percentage of blacks are college graduates than of whites in every article I have seen. If it could be shown that the percentage of black hired out of the qualified blacks available is higher than the percentage of whites hired out of the percentage of whites available, and /or that the whites sell larger accounts because the ads they produce sell more then the complaint can be dismissed and the tables turned.  Perhaps it could be extortion or other crimes were committed to force more blacks into the business than the percentage of qualified available blacks can justify. I do not have the real numbers but if it can be shown to be correct then the tables should be turned.<br>
  Equal opportunity does not produce equal results and this should not be expected by the NAACP.<br>
  Who is going to sue all the professional sports teams for too many minorities in relation to the population ?  Why not if equal results are required for other businesses?<br>
   Does anyone have the correct percentage of black and white college graduates ?<br>
   Can you give me a reason why I am wrong ?<br>

<p>These agencies are part of the advertising bunch that insist on including a black in every ad, and Asians, Indians, whatever, in far greater proportion than their numbers in society.  It&rsquo;s as if they have taken on the task of promoting multiculturalism as if it were part of their jobs to brainwash the public into believing these people are more numerous than they are. Something like Obama&rsquo;s cabinet selections.</p>
<p>Well, now they&rsquo;re getting smacked right in the face with what they&rsquo;ve been pushing all along.  I wonder how they&rsquo;re going to feel losing out to a non-white for a job they might be applying for even though they&rsquo;re the most qualified candidate.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch.  For all the harm they&rsquo;ve done to all of us, the industry couldn&rsquo;t have been any worse if it were all black.</p>

			<p>Does anyone have figures on what percentage of the <i>labor force</i> blacks represent?  We are constantly bombarded with statistics of how many blacks are not working, e.g. incarcerated, stay at home welfare recipients, etc.  Do blacks participate in the labor force proportionally with their percentage of the general population?  And at what educational level are black workers?</p>
<p>Perhaps workforce participation and educational levels alone are enough to explain the lack of blacks in higher level occupations?  No?  Must be those evil white people again&hellip;</p>

			<p>How about Whites get in on this racket?  I found the WaMu ads with a black leading around penned-up Whites to be pretty offensive.  And how about the fact that EVERY ad that features a burglar (alarm company ads, etc.) has a White one?  I can&rsquo;t get enough of the ads with the hapless White doof being rescued by the sensible black genius.</p>

			<p>Class action suit?  God I hope so.  About time they had a dose of their own.</p>
<p>I hope the media in general is next.  Hollywood has <i>unions</i>, they&rsquo;re begging to be eviscerated by the AA types.</p>
<p>I will be happy when ALL positions in the media (in front of and behind the camera), traditional purveyors of race-replacement, are filled by blacks.  Let them reflect their own desires.</p>

			<p>I say sue sue sue.  This is the same Madison Avenue that&rsquo;s pushing diversity down our throats, and yet it&rsquo;s not enough for the NAACP.  (Of course, the NAACP will only go after white liberal types because they&rsquo;re sucker enough to put out.  If Madison Avenue were run by, e.g. Theodore Bilbo, the NAACP would have no incentive).</p>

			<p>The problem is that you have to be really smart, clever and creative to be successful in advertising.  These are qualities that Africans generally lack.  </p>

			<p>I have little sympathy for big companies and industries that are hit by affirmative action lawsuits.</p>
<p>The elites could have stopped this back in the 1970&rsquo;s.  Instead they choose to fund NAACP and other affirmative action legal organizations.  It has been obvious for a long time that the elites want to eliminate whites.</p>
<p>For instance, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Manufacturers are now suing the federal government to prevent the enforcement of the E-verify telephone/computer system that enables an employer to quickly verify the SS# of prospective employees.</p>
<p>So the Chamber of Commerce joins with LARAZA to ensure that American whites go without jobs while employers hire illegal hispanics.</p>
<p>The black and hispanic organizations and all the anti white affirmative action lawsuits are funded by contributions from the largest corporations and wealthiest individuals in America. They created affirmative action,let them enjoy the consequences.</p>
<p>As blacks are pushed out of the alternative to welfare government jobs by hispanics and asians, the private sector will face even more lawsuits for affirmative action for blacks.  Let them deal with the disfunctional blacks they foisted on others.</p>
<p>Those wealthy individuals and organizations have also funded the &#8220;civil rights for all but whites&#8221; legal organizations that created the system whereby criminals are set free to murder, rob and rape again.</p>

			<p>I used to work in advertising for a major international agency with famous clients.  I can tell you that for the most part these people are rabidly liberal&hellip;even the self proclaimed &#8220;conservatives&#8221; among them.  This was 25 years ago in a very liberal city.  I can&rsquo;t even imagine what the work environment is like by now.  So if this discrimination suit happens, I can only smirk.  It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving bunch of liberal do-gooder swine.  Sleep with dogs&hellip;wake up with fleas.  Enjoy the diversity, guys!</p>

			<p>* The total U.S. population is 12.8% African-American. Blacks should represent 9.6% of advertising professionals and managers, according to U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission estimates. But actual representation falls dramatically short of that expectation &mdash; about 55% short.</p>
<p>&hellip;.all this pandering to quotas is just widow dressing and so unAmerican(it feels strange for me to type that as I am in the SH but it&rsquo;s also unWestern), I always thought of America as being about free and open competiton and it was your entrepreneurial spirit and individualized thinking that are your greatest strengths and biggest assets when competing with the likes of China, India, Japan etc. </p>
<p>So all industries should reflect the demographics of the community perfectly?<br>
Do blacks ever stop and say &#8220;whoa, we&rsquo;re 14% of this workforce, we need to lay off 1%, volunteers please&#8221;<br>
Of course not, we whites really need to unify and whine more publically and politically. I know it hasn&rsquo;t tradionally been our style. <br>
But the squeaky wheel is getting all the oil.<br>
We need to break the the PC barriers that silence us and marginilize us, don&rsquo;t ask me how.<br>
But I know we can feel our movement taking some shape and form, it is comming together frustratingly slowly, and we have lots of little incomplete groups vying to lead us, there&rsquo;s just too much freedom of choice (which I must admit I too enjoy). <br>
We need our own genetic religion/group/philosophy/club something that no one can take away from us and that all (most)whites feel comfortable showing that they support like the old school boy scouts or being a freemason or 1950&rsquo;s Christainity, but  without some watchdog organization slapping the &#8216;hate group&rsquo; slicker on it.<br>
Restarting an old untarnished movement, would have more credibility than some &#8216;new thing&rsquo;.<br>
One minute we&rsquo;re not even allowed to be a racial group at all the next, some &#8216;other racial group&rsquo; wants extra help because they&rsquo;re being left behind, it&rsquo;s enough to drive you crazy.<br>
I&rsquo;m sick of us collectively having to pay the debt for our previous generations so called historical follies, and in some cases for events going back hundreds of years.<br>
If we had the simplicity of a iron age battle where we all met in a field and faced each other, the blue guys vs the red guys with swords and axes things would be a lot clearer.<br>
Our battle is nothing like what our ancestors have ever had to deal with, maybe we need a Socrates or (our own) Jesus to start a revolution of the mind, a renaissance if you will, a renaissance of will. To remove our shackles.</p>

			<p>For a long time the social security administration was a whooping 63 percent black female.  Black females are only 6 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Discrimination????? Disparity???  Where was that evil anti white racist Supreme Court Justice Brennan to proclaim <br>
&#8221; disproportionate representation is in and of itself clear and present evidence of discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not, the huge overrepresentation was simply a result of rigorous civil service examinations.  Hardy har har har</p>
<p>After the Rodney King riots and OJ trial, MALDEF LARAZA sued the County of Los Angeles for discrimination because although the population of Los Angeles County, (not the City) was only 10 percent black, 38 percent of the employees of the County were black.</p>
<p>Why not a massive exchange between the bus drivers or post office and the advertizing industry?  That should equalize things.</p>
<p>Like other posters, I&rsquo;m glad to see another anti white elitist bastion of liberalism face discrimination lawsuits.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s trade.  How about the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission starts obeying the quota system it imposes on the rest of the nation?</p>
<p>Accodring to their quota system and the vicious Judiciary&rsquo;s system of &#8220;proportionate representation,&#8221; only 12.8 percent blacks, 6.4 black women and 6.4 black men can work for the EEOC.  Most of the EEOC employees are non white females, a gross disparity which is in and of itself evidence of discrimination against white, especially white men.  Over all, women and minorities are over represented by about 80 percent.  The few White men working for the EEOC were hired under the affirmative action for the handicapped program.</p>
<p>I always call the EEOC the gestapo.  Just as Hitler&rsquo;s gestapo was responsible for seeing that German employers didn&rsquo;t hire Jews, the EEOC is responsible for ensuring that American employers don&rsquo;t hire whites.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the &#8220;Civil Rights Don&rsquo;t Apply to Whites&#8221; division of the DOJ are the lead agencies in the federal governments destruction of the Whites of this country.</p>
<p>Hope they enjoy it when their tax base is 70 percent welfare receipients and 25 percent below minimum wage illegals.  Hope they enjoy it when our military consists of women, 5&rsquo;6 250 pd hispanic men and 80 IQ black men.  Hope they enjoy it when our diplomats consist of ghetto Mammas and gangsters.  Hope they enjoy living in the horrible combination of Mexico, China, India, Egypt and Africa America will soon become.</p>

			<p>It took the worst U.S. Regime in history for a majority of people, who have vote straight across the board for their own self interest since its inception, to vote for the most qualified.  Don&rsquo;t forget those that voted for Obama were mostly young people and those were the liberal ones.   It&rsquo;s not about liberalism, percentages, even race, it&rsquo;s about control.   Pull of the hood and turn on the light. </p>
