<p>The illegal alien from Guatemala spoke to the Boston Globe anonymously because he feared deportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just collecting what was rightfully owed to me,&#8221; he said in Spanish. &#8220;They already pay us a miserable amount of money. Why do they have to rob us?&#8221;</p>
<p>The alien spent years at a Super 88 supermarket seafood counter earning $6 an hour instead of the state&rsquo;s $8 an hour minimum wage. He grew frustrated as the supermarket did not compensate him for his overtime work.</p>
<p>One day, he decided to gather his pay stubs into a plastic bag and deliver them to a lawyer &mdash; who turned them over to the state attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Super 88 was ordered to provide back pay and fines of $200,000 to more than 300 workers, the Globe reported.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens now make up 17 percent of Massachusetts&rsquo; workers &mdash; twice the state&rsquo;s 1980 workforce. Authorities have expressed concern that employers sometimes exploit illegals because they believe aliens will not report them to state labor authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the report, Attorney General Martha Coakley has staffed bilingual employees, allowed complaints to be filed in 90 languages and provided logbooks to nonprofit organizations to help illegal aliens track their hours.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In November, 764 former workers at a New Bedford factory raided by U.S. immigration agents won an $850,000 settlement. The company was forced to pay overtime wages.</p>
<p>In May, C-Mart Supermarket in Chinatown was forced to pay $66,000 for not adhering to state minimum wage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steve Kropper, cochair of Massachusetts Citizens for Immigration Reform, said illegals are not entitled to minimum wage because they are not citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;No government resources should be devoted to the rights of people who are here illegally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They broke the law by being here. They had no right to the job.&#8221;<br>

			<p>They know their rights from the second they cross the border. A few years ago I worked at a pizza shop and a person called who barely spoke English. They wanted a special for a one topping pizza but wanted so many additional toppings that they would have gotten a different special cheaper. They did not understand and hung the phone up. A few minutes later some attorney called and asked why we had refused them service. We explained the situation, she seemed mollified and placed the order for them. I had to wonder who was paying this attorney&rsquo;s salary if not our tax dollars.</p>

			<p>I think this is wonderful! I think illegals should get lawsuit-happy and sue for everything under the sun. If employers can&rsquo;t exploit them, then there will be no incentive to hire them.</p>

			<p>Fine.  Pay the mestizo what he is owed.  Then charge him for his own deportation, and fine Super 88 for hiring him.  Of course it might be a good idea for the government to stop putting pressure on these stores to hire minorities.  </p>
<p>Does anyone find the name of the store, &#8220;Super 88&#8221;, somewhat amusing in this context?</p>

			<p>When I read he was paid $2.00 less than minimum for years I was pretty sure who owned the market.  I went to google and sure enough:</p>
<p>Articles | Boston Globe | August 14th, 2005<br>
From its wall of rice to its various and fascinating offerings of seafood, Super 88 is a quintessential Asian market. But it&rsquo;s also a changing market,<br>
www.super88market.com/articles_bg_081405.htm - 33k </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons Mr. Hsu and his fellow Asians are so anxious to move to America.  A huge supply of illegal alien hispanic slave workers.</p>
<p>Workers at evil whitey owned supermarkets are paid lawful wages.  Most white owned markets pay well over minimum with labor unions, benefits, a career path and long term jobs.</p>

			<p>I have no pity for the companies that were fired.<br>
Perhaps if there were more lawsuits against these companies it might make them reluctant to hire illegals.</p>
<p>We need to remove the financial incentives, such as low pay and benefits, that encourage people to employ illegals.</p>

			<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t mind this.  If employers realize they have to pay illegals the same as Americans, then what is the incentive to hire illegals? They thought they were getting away with something and end up having to pay it all anyway.  Plus the fact that since they were paying under the minimum wage, they knew these workers were illegal.  So no excuses like &#8220;Gosh, I didn&rsquo;t know they were illegal, I&rsquo;m not an immigration agent.&#8221;  So maybe they will hire true American workers and not take any chances.  We&rsquo;ll see.  </p>

			<p>Super 88 is an Asian supermarket.</p>
<p>Whenever I read one of those Asian immigrant success stories  such as Korean Doctor&rsquo;s family now worth 6 million, I know exactly how they made so much money in so little time.</p>
<p>Paying less than minimum wage, unpaid overtime, no benefits,tax evasion,  employing illegal aliens is the standard way Asian immigrants run their businesses.</p>
<p>Wonder how much a year Super 88 makes in fraudulent food stamp reimbursements?</p>

			<p>This is so great!!! I hope more illegals speak out. What this low IQ third worlder don&rsquo;t understand is that their only here to be exploited by the elites.  If more employers found out they have to pay the illegals the same  as Americans they would be unemployed.  </p>

<p>Now, that&rsquo;s an interesting question. But I would be against it because it would make hiring illegals too attractive, and preferable to hiring Americans.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t somebody break the law by hiring them? If not, there should be a law!</p>

			<p>My position on illegal aliens is mostly deportationist, and they should not receive American welfare benefits.  BUT, I would allow illegal aliens to join American unions.  That would mean they would lobby for the higher pay that neutralized the American establishments&rsquo; reason for open borders.  It would have the net effect of closing the borders, for a lack of cheap labor.</p>

			<p>This may go against what most on AmRen believe, but I hope illegals sue&hellip;and WIN&hellip;these cases all over the United States.  Eliminate the monetary benefit that companies enjoy by hiring illegals at lower wages and you eliminate their purpose for lobbying U.S. politicians.  The more businesses are sued for pay discrimination by illegals and lose these cases in court, the more likely they are to realize that the benefit of hiring illegals at sub-standard wages is simply not worth the risk of getting caught.<br>
Also, we can only hope that after these illegals financially drain their former employers, that the federal government comes in and puts the final nail in their coffins by fining them for employing illegals in the first place.<br>
It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving group of people.</p>

			<p>And this is a bad thing? Employers read news stories too. They see an employer hire ILLEGALS and it comes back to bite them in the backside. Another reason not to hire ILLEGALS.</p>
<p>Im all for the government forcing employers to pay ILEGALS higher wages. This would just be more incentive to hire Americans and NOT to hire ILLEGAL ALIENS</p>

			<p>Good. These greedy White Americans who hire them deserve to have it get stuck to them because they are the main reason we have a problem with illegals. Instead of hiring americans for a fair wage, these greedy white employers want docile workers for slave wages. What they are too stupid to realize is that when their(illegals/latin americans) numbers get large enough, their power will increase and naturally they&rsquo;ll demand higher wages.</p>

			<p>I wish every illegal alien in America would sue their employeer for back pay.</p>
<p>The only reason employers want illegal here is so they can take advantage of them. They pay under the table with no insurance or taxes. I can&rsquo;t believe the IRS hasn&rsquo;t got in on this, there are probably enough unpaid taxes to pay off the national debt. </p>
<p>There are companies out there that have whole crews working and have never payed unemployment insurance or taxes on the workers. Many don&rsquo;t pay the minimum wage or overtime. It&rsquo;s very hard to try to compete with these people. </p>

<p>At the core, from the beginning, he shouldn&rsquo;t be here; therefore, he deserves nothing. He should be glad that he got away with $6/hour for this long. </p>
<p>People need to learn to be happy with the way they were from the beginning. We live in an age or wanting more, more, more, now, now, now! I may have more access to opportunities in the U.S., but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I should always take it. I&rsquo;m glad have the only view and standard that count. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Good. These greedy White Americans who hire them deserve to have it get stuck to them&#8221;</p>
<p>In this case the greedy employers were not White Americans but Asian immigrants.  Super 88 is an Asian owned chain.</p>

			<p>This is good news; forcing companies to pay illegals the same wages as US citizens and Green Card holders makes the illegals considerably lesss appealing as employees.  The only motivation driving the hiring of illegals in the first place has been economic, after all.</p>

********************************************</p>
<p>Steve Kropper is absolutely wrong.  Fair labor standards apply to everyone.  You cannot pay an illegal alien less than minimum wage, just like you cannot employ them as children, make them work in unsafe conditions, rob them, rape them, or murder them.</p>
<p>Kropper also seems to miss the important point that most of the AmRen posters got   &mdash;   if you take away the benefits of exploiting illegals, greedy employers will be less likely to hire them.</p>
<p>In fact, fair labor standards and OSHA regulations are a good way to strike at companies that hire illegals.  Let&rsquo;s say you see a work crew of hiapanics without proper safety gear.  ICE won&rsquo;t come if you don&rsquo;t have proof they&rsquo;re illegals, but OSHA will come.</p>

			<p>Wages are relative.  Mexicans working for less than our minimum wage earn ten to twenty times what they make in Mexico doing the same work.  </p>
<p>As long as a single able bodied American is unemployed the illegals and aliens here on work visas have no right to work in our country.  </p>
<p>Not only do these job stealers illegally drain our social services dry, but unemployed Americans have to compete with them for social services expressly conceived to assist Americans&hellip;           </p>

			<p>Something similiar happened in S. California a couple years ago.<br>
 <br>
A Korean supermarket chain was ordered to give hundreds of thousands of dollars of back pay to illegal hispanic and filippino immigrants who had been paid less than minimum wage. They also collected years of unpaid overtime for their 16 and 18 hour work days.  The social security adminstration, workmen&rsquo;s comp and other agencies got involved.  The workers were paid by check.  The Korean owners had deducted the standard payroll taxes but neglected to turn in the money to the agencies, keeping the payroll taxes for themselves.</p>
<p>As I keep saying, behind every successful immigrant business story there is a story of tax evasion, exploitation of workers and refusal to play by the rules.</p>

			<p>People are surprised when they hear that I completely agree with illegals recieving workers compensation benefits and that they should have standing to sue their employers.</p>
<p>What people don&rsquo;t seem to get, despite my best efforts at explaining it, is that these greedy employers shouldn&rsquo;t get any additional protections whatsoever for hiring illegals rather U.S. Citizens.  I love to see these greedy businesses pay up.      </p>
