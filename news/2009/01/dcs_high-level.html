			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roxanne Roberts and Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eleven days after the presidential election, 100 people were invited to the home of Vernon and Ann Jordan. The guest of honor was former Time Warner chief Richard Parsons, but the belle of the ball was Valerie Jarrett, one of Barack Obama&rsquo;s best friends and a newly named White House senior adviser.</p>
<p>All night the Jordans&rsquo; guests  &mdash;  many VIPs in their own right  &mdash;  surrounded Jarrett, eager to introduce themselves and welcome her to D.C. Business as usual. Every four or eight years, Washington&rsquo;s primarily white, influential, moneyed set rushes to cozy up to the new power brokers in town: Texans when George W. Bush arrived, Arkansas buddies when Bill Clinton came to town. The city&rsquo;s high-level social scene  &mdash;  dinners, black-tie fundraisers, receptions, ubiquitous book parties  &mdash;  is the place where money and experience are subtly traded for access and influence.</p>
<p>Except for the first time, the face of ultimate power is African American. With a black first family in the White House and a diverse group of appointees and Cabinet nominees, the all-white dinner party feels all wrong. Certain hosts are suddenly grappling with a new reality: They need some black friends. Overnight, black politicians, lawyers and journalists are hot properties, receiving engraved invitations from people they never got invitations from before.</p>
<p>Blacks have gone from barely being on the list to being in charge of the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows that his campaign was about inclusion,&#8221; Jarrett said. &#8220;We would expect that spirit of inclusion to also reflect on Washington&rsquo;s social scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>A swift shift is underway in this exclusive set of those who deal with the highest level of federal government. That&rsquo;s a signal of wholesale change, said A. Scott Bolden, managing partner of law firm Reed Smith&rsquo;s Washington office and a longtime politico in a city where professionals work side by side by day, but socialize separately at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see those &#8216;What&rsquo;s In and Out&rsquo; columns every year?&#8221; he asked with a laugh. &#8220;With Obama and the first family in town, arguably being black is &#8216;in.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama era has ushered in plenty of talk that the country has transcended race or that race is incidental.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question there&rsquo;s been more race discussions in social circles this year than there&rsquo;s ever been,&#8221; said Rosen, who is part of a longtime integrated group of friends that includes political strategist Donna Brazile, D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), journalist Karen Tumulty and former Democratic National Committee official Minyon Moore. &#8220;We were having dinner, arguing about what &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; meant,&#8221; Rosen said. &#8220;Ultimately we decided there was no such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The subject is close to former defense secretary William S. Cohen and his wife, Janet Langhart Cohen, who wrote &#8220;Love in Black and White&#8221; about their interracial marriage. The couple have been a fixture at Washington parties, where she has often been the only African American in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most whites don&rsquo;t like to talk about race when I&rsquo;m there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it always comes up at mostly black dinner parties.&#8221; In their own home, the Cohens and their guests talk more freely about race. &#8220;They feel that they are among equals and are really willing to discuss and engage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are not afraid to say what they think.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Johnson is skeptical about whether more frank conversation leads to integration. Hosts will be &#8220;politically correct&#8221; and invite African Americans, he said, but that will last about a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a sustainable socialization model for Washington,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Integration socially, as opposed to business or sports, is really tough because it involves people&rsquo;s personal lives&hellip; . Once people get comfortable  &mdash;  &#8216;I&rsquo;ve got my two black friends&rsquo;  &mdash;  they can stop. Real integration on a personal level doesn&rsquo;t happen without a deep commonality of interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vernon Jordan thinks it&rsquo;s too early to tell. His wife is much more optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will change overnight,&#8221; she predicted. &#8220;It really will. It&rsquo;s been changing, but this is a jump-start. Once change takes place, you can&rsquo;t go back. That&rsquo;s the great thing about it.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Once change takes place, you can&rsquo;t go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true.  America will never be the same and we can&rsquo;t go back.  We will have to decide for ourselves if we are willing to make the sacrifices necessary to find a separate place for ourselves where we can feel at home, or if we are willing to remain strangers in a strange land.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;With Obama as president, &ldquo;the all-white dinner party feels all wrong.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yes, and there will be many blacks everywhere in Washington circles, which will mean brawls, muggings, robberies and assault, will finally make it to the inner circles of the beltway.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get much better than this, nor could it happen to a nicer bunch of people.</p>

			<p>When I see blacks I go the other way. I travel 10 miles each way to the grocery store so I can be in the White part of town instead of just down the street with the Mexicans and blacks. These rich White liberals in DC are truly insane.</p>

			<p>Statistically speaking, BHO is what is called an &#8220;outlier&#8221;, an individual who is so far from typical as to have no statistical meaning.  Another poster referred to him as having won the genetic lottery, as far as Blacks go.  When all these newly empowered Blacks show up at these parties, some of them will be, like BHO, far, far above the Black average.  But the only way to get the right proportion of Blacks in the door is the same way they get into law school, affirmative action.  These D.C. power players are accustomed to mixing with other highly intelligent people, (elected officials excepted, of course) and when they have to pay court to Blacks they&rsquo;ll quickly find that they have to adjust their conversation to accommodate their new friends. <br>
      It&rsquo;s sometimes possible for a person of modest ability to work very hard and keep up with their more gifted co-workers on routine tasks.  But a party is not a job, it&rsquo;s a place where conversations can be unpredictable, and a D.C. power player&rsquo;s party treacherously so.  I don&rsquo;t think that the upstart who finds himself in over his head can just hide by talking about sports, his inadequacy will be discovered quickly by ambitious people who excel at assessing other&rsquo;s weaknesses.  It will be uncomfortable all around, the Whites will spot the mediocrity of the Blacks, and the Blacks will smell the patronizing attitude of the Whites.  The Whites will continue to invite the Blacks and the Blacks will either accept the invitations and eat the food, or develop their own party circuit.  And the Whites will have their own little &#8220;intimate&#8221; gatherings where they can feel comfortable.  But will they really learn from this?</p>

			<p>Sociologists have long found that &#8220;assortative mating&#8221; as well as more casual voluntary interactions are largely confined to people with roughly the same general intelligence  &mdash;   give or take ten IQ points. Standards of morality, artistic tastes and the like tend to stratify with intelligence, reinforcing the impulse of birds of a feather to flock together.</p>
<p>Now guess why blacks, browns and whites don&rsquo;t socialize much except under the gun of law, and why orientals and Jews tend to avoid the &#8220;shvartzes&#8221; and peons even more. Oops, that IQ and race business is not to be talked about in polite Belteay society, is it? Luckily there are always a few bright minority outliers, mischlingen such as POTUS 45 and quota hires around to make up a respectably PC party.</p>
<p>Beyond the bubble, the rising numbers of less cognitively equipped Americans as a fraction of the population (50% by 2044) causes increased, self-protective clinging to one&rsquo;s own kind. There is less need to venture beyond gated community, shtetl, ghetto or barrio if one&rsquo;s own race csn furnish most economic and social requirements. </p>
<p>The more segregation officially becomes a thing of the past, the more it is reasserting itself in the vital spheres of our lives in which the State does not (yet) compel us to mingle. Without conscious acknowledgment, perhaps, but no less firmly for all that. The liberal who moves to the burbs &#8220;to avoid crime&#8221;, the fan who watches NASCAR more than football these days, the pious Christian who doesn&rsquo;t care for too much gospel and hollering&hellip; they know in their hearts what call they are answering.</p>
<p>USA as Greater Mexico or Brazil, or formal separation into monoracial polities&hellip; which will it be? For the race-blind Potemkin village Obama is presiding over will fall down almost as fast as Potemkin&rsquo;s flimsy facades.</p>

			<p>No doubt this will be particularly cruel to those blacks that used to cook and serve at these dinner parties. I know they need the extra bucks&hellip;.but how can you have black waiters serving the table when some of the guests are just as black? Would there not be some hard looks and loaded questions?</p>

			<p>Most Americans are not concerned about D C&rsquo;s high level social scene, because most Americans have the whole DC culture already pegged as a bunch of traitors and degenerates to the nation as a whole. Hundreds if not thousands of ex-Washington insiders have to written books describing the degeneracy of the place. The backstabbing, lies, social climbing, gossip, vile gossip, mean little schemes against &#8220;enemies&#8221;, etc. Sounds to me that no decent person would want a thing to do with the place. </p>

<p>Mainly because there are people like the ones on this site who think under every circumstance blacks are inferior and incapable of doingg a job. Many of them see a six foot two inch black man at a job interview and see him as something inferior. They have a few bad experiences and watch a few movies and rap videos that potray negative sterotypes and think to themselves &#8220;Wow this is how they truely are&#8221;. <br>

<p>Just HOW could it feel wrong. Why would you want non-Whites invited to YOUR dinner party?</p>

			<p>rational thinker: As another poster said this past week, people confuse prejudice with conclusions.  I have seen capable Blacks doing their jobs well, and I have seen Whites doing their jobs poorly.  But I still conclude that Blacks on average are mentally inferior to Whites because most of them that I see are.  There are some women that are taller than most men, but my observation is that most men are taller than most women.  Why, if the height of women is not a subject of debate, is the intelligence of Blacks so controversial?  I have seen a few sharp Black teachers, but I have never seen a White teacher as dumb as some of the Black teachers I&rsquo;ve seen.  I&rsquo;m sure that everyone has similar experiences, as the Washington partygoers will too.  <br>
     As a teacher, I am aware that some kids are overlooked.  They get nervous and don&rsquo;t test well, who knows, but you get the sense that there&rsquo;s more to them than is immediately apparent.  For years, I have &#8220;stolen&#8221; some of these children from the classes they&rsquo;ve been assigned to and put them in my own, more advanced classes.    Given the opportunity and encouragement, they manage to keep up.  They might get Cs, but I&rsquo;ve never had to fail one, which is why my school allows me to do this.  So, if affirmative action merely gives overlooked Blacks the opportunity to show what they can do, are affirmative action hires the equal of their White co-workers?  Do they do as well in colleges as the Whites in their classes?   Not a chance.  Which is why rational thinkers soon conclude that, on average, Blacks are mentally inferior to Whites.  </p>
