			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sue Reid, Daily Mail (London), January 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The official at the housing office was typically blunt. His third customer of the day, a blonde with a northern accent, the pinched face of poverty and a baby in a buggy, looked crestfallen when she heard the news.</p>
<p>&#8216;You&rsquo;ll have to wait between one and ten years for a flat from us,&rsquo; he said, blithely, from behind his desk. &#8216;There are 18,000 people on the waiting list and, as of today, only 30 homes to go round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No wonder that when the young woman left, pushing the buggy out of the door into the sleeting rain of the shopping precinct in Salford, Greater Manchester, she looked near to tears. In her haste, she almost collided with Jason Hedgecock, a 20-year-old chef, who has also been queuing at the city&rsquo;s Home Search office.</p>
<p>&#8216;My family come from Salford, and I was born here,&rsquo; he says flatly. &#8216;I have been waiting three years for a home, ever since I left school. I&rsquo;ve put my name down for one on the eighth floor over there,&rsquo; he points to an ugly blue and white tower block, called Fitzwarren Court, across the busy road.</p>
<p>Jason is desperate to move out of the home he shares with his parents, John and Eileen, where he has to sleep on the sofa. Also living there are his two brothers, Scott, 24, and Adam, 19, as well as Adam&rsquo;s pregnant girlfriend, 20-year-old Jade  &mdash;  none of whom has anywhere else to go.</p>
<p>But the chances of a generation of young people such as Jason and the disappointed blonde ever getting a council home in Salford are next to zero. They are living in one of many places in England where a dire shortage of state housing has become the most controversial political issue of our time.</p>
<p>The statistics are stark. One in 12 council homes in England are now lived in by migrants, while the list of people waiting for social housing has doubled during Labour&rsquo;s time in power to 1.7million.</p>
<p>Last week, a government report from the Whitehall department of Communities Minister Hazel Blears warned that the crisis has resulted in a surge of popularity for extremist groups, including the British National Party.</p>
<p>After interviewing 43 British families in Birmingham, Milton Keynes, Liverpool&rsquo;s Runcorn and Thetford in Norfolk, the report concluded that the white working class think they have been &#8216;betrayed&rsquo; and &#8216;abandoned&rsquo; by mainstream politicians who make them &#8216;come second&rsquo; to immigrants on the housing ladder.</p>
<p>The report provoked an instant response from a seemingly repentant Ms Blears herself. She admitted that white working-class people &#8216;sometimes just don&rsquo;t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them&rsquo;, adding that they should be allowed to voice their worries &#8216;without fear of being branded racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the furore that followed, Frank Field, Labour MP for Liverpool&rsquo;s Birkenhead and joint chairman of the Cross-Party Group on Balanced Migration, agreed that the Government was riding roughshod over the working class at its peril.</p>
<p>He predicted that Labour policies on housing would turn local people to Far Right parties in the next general election, echoing a dire warning he gave last year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Slowly, but determinedly, the white English working class  &mdash;  and I guess, some black Britons, too  &mdash;  are voting against unlimited immigration by embracing the BNP,&rsquo; he said back then.</p>
<p>So, what is the truth? Of course, there are two sides to this story. As well as being responsible for years of uncontrolled immigration, New Labour has created a benefit culture that has led to vast numbers of white working-class families not bothering to seek jobs and exploiting the welfare system. Too often they complain that all the work is going to newly arrived foreigners.</p>
<p>Predictably, the BNP has been busily exploiting this; making inroads in towns and cities where mass migration, unemployment among local people and housing shortages are huge issues.</p>
<p>The party holds 12 seats on the council in Barking, Essex, a quarter of the total. In Stoke, Staffordshire, there are six BNP councillors, and the BNP last year captured one seat of the 25 on the London Assembly.</p>
<p>The party now has a sprinkling of councillors in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria, although in Salford (Hazel Blears&rsquo;s constituency) the BNP&rsquo;s six candidates failed to gain seats at last year&rsquo;s council elections, with only one making a respectable showing.</p>
<p><b>Growing bitterness</b></p>
<p>Indeed, Salford has always been staunchly Labour  &mdash;  Karl Marx even lived there in the 1800s to research his tome The Condition of the Working Class In England.</p>
<p>But that may be about to change. This summer, Nick Griffin, the controversial BNP leader, will stand in the European Elections as a candidate for the northwest of England constituency, which includes Salford, where I went this week to see how Blears&rsquo;s remarks have been received.</p>
<p>There, no one could be more pleased about the BNP&rsquo;s resurgence than Jason. He hails from a working-class family which has voted Labour in Salford for generations. His father is a retired landlord at the city&rsquo;s Royal British Legion club, and his grandfather was a porter at the nearby Hope Hospital.</p>
<p>Jason is about to break ranks. In June  &mdash;  like many other young people ranging from shop-workers, to bricklayers, young mothers and the unemployed  &mdash;  he will be putting a cross on his ballot paper next to Griffin&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Robert Whelan, a director of the think-tank Civitas, is not surprised. &#8216;The white working class is growing bitter,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&#8216;They loyally supported Old Labour, but New Labour has ignored them. Ministers have shut down the debate on mass migration. If the working class object to what is happening, they are called racist. They are not allowed to discuss their concerns publicly.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is fuelling the fires of extremism, and the BNP is knocking on the door. The working classes feel there has been a huge unfairness, particularly when it comes to housing. It is the big bone of contention.</p>
<p>&#8216;They feel they have paid into the system, and should get something out. That was how it used to work right up to the 1990s. Then New Labour dismantled the system. Now housing priority is about need, not about the time you have lived in a town or city, or how long your name has been on the list. This is making local people feel they are missing out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, some might question the whole idea of an inalienable right to housing provided by the State  &mdash;  for immigrants, or for those who are British born and bred. But assuming it is the State&rsquo;s responsibility, just how is property allocated?</p>
<p>In Salford  &mdash;  like many other towns and cities where Labour is in control  &mdash;  the criteria for getting a house or flat is based on whether you are homeless and the size of your family. Inevitably, this puts a newly arrived immigrant couple with a large number of children at the front of the queue.</p>
<p>A pamphlet issued by the council&rsquo;s letting service Home Search  &mdash;  titled A New Way Of Finding A Home  &mdash;  contains instructions about how to get help with housing in 12 languages, including Polish, Arabic, French, Mandarin and Urdu. Home Search offers translators for those who can&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>Each week, the service issues a list of empty council properties. People are invited to put in a bid for up to three homes each week. If more than one person bids for a home  &mdash;  which in Salford is inevitable  &mdash;  the successful one is deemed to be the person in most need.</p>
<p><b>Council housing</b></p>
<p>Thousands of people are on waiting lists for council housing, with some complaining that new migrants get preferential treatment</p>
<p>Under the strict criteria, homeless people, those threatened with homelessness or those with medical problems come top. Although the leaflet states that people with a local connection will be given some priority, it adds bluntly: &#8216;The lower your housing need, the longer it will take for you to find a new home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bidding system is little better than farce. There has been a terrible shortage of subsidised housing since hundreds of Coronation Street-style terrace houses were destroyed in the Seventies to make way for council blocks. And now even more have been pulled down. Whole swathes of the city are derelict with homes boarded up.</p>
<p>&#8216;For many local people the waiting time turns out to be for ever. There is no end to it,&rsquo; he says, standing with his former girlfriend, Kayleigh Brassington, 19. The couple, who remain friends, have a baby, Jacob, two, and are bringing him up together.</p>
<p>Kayleigh used to live with the baby, her mother, two brothers and little sister Terri-Lee, 12, in a two-bedroom house near the shopping precinct. There was so little space that she slept in the same room as Terri-Lee and her then newborn Jacob.</p>
<p>But still she didn&rsquo;t win a bid for accommodation. &#8216;I never got nearer than 20th, whatever kind of home I bid for. In the end, I approached a Manchester housing association and they gave me a flat,&rsquo; she says.</p>
<p>&#8216;I got sick of coming down to the housing office and seeing a whole line of foreign-speaking people being handed out houses. It isn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t want them to have a home, it is just that I wanted one, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s brother, Adam, works at the local bingo hall, also near the shopping precinct. His girlfriend, Jade, is expecting their baby in March.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have been bidding for a council flat for two years now. If you come down to the office early in the morning on a Wednesday, when they give out the list of the homes available, you will see as many foreigners in the queue as the people from Salford,&rsquo; he says with a grimace.</p>
<p>Adam adds: &#8216;It&rsquo;s difficult living with Jade at my parents&rsquo; house. I have a job, I work hard, yet, I have to beg a bed from my mother and father. Of course, we feel angry.</p>
<p>&#8216;My parents were given a council house when they were young. I know a lot of people, including my own brother, who will vote BNP. What else can we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Standing nearby in the shopping precinct is Chris Tyldesley, a 23-year-old who is Salford born and bred. His mother kicked him out of her council house (she was allocated one by Old Labour in her early 20s) a couple of years ago because &#8216;we were always arguing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He explains: &#8216;I ended up living on the floor of a mate. I was homeless, but because I had a floor to lie on they didn&rsquo;t treat me as though I had nowhere to live.</p>
<p>&#8216;It meant I didn&rsquo;t stand a chance, although I came from Salford. I am a qualified mechanic, and have worked and paid my taxes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chris, however, was lucky. In October last year he won a bid for a flat in Spruce Court, a block five minutes&rsquo; walk from the housing office. Now he says the ceiling is leaking and he would love to find somewhere else. &#8216;I keep bidding, but I don&rsquo;t have much hope.</p>
<p>&#8216;In my block, there are lots of foreigners. They use the phone box in the lobby to call their families with phone cards given to them by the council, and speak in languages I can&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Drift to the Right</b></p>
<p>Not long after, a young Polish girl emerges from Salford Home Search office. She is clearly pleased, and is clutching a piece of lined paper with writing in green ink on it. It gives the address of a council house which she has just been allocated.</p>
<p>Anna Tronia is 25, has a young baby, and has lived in Britain since her country joined the EU four years ago, allowing her to live here.</p>
<p>But should she really be given a council house? &#8216;I had nowhere, and so I told them that,&rsquo; she says, excitedly. &#8216;I have a baby, and I think that helped, too. I don&rsquo;t work any more now that I am a mother. I am very pleased about what has happened to me in Salford,&rsquo; she says, before walking off down the street towards a group of her friends.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I meet Abdul Aljenid, a handsome 30-year-old from the Sudan. He came to Britain on a three-year visa to study English in 2005.</p>
<p>He says he goes to Salford College for six hours a week and works on a construction site on the city&rsquo;s quayside overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal. He is helping to build the new northern headquarters of the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8216;The work is hard, I admit. But I like it in England. I live with my friend over there,&rsquo; he points to another block near the precinct.</p>
<p>&#8216;My friend is also from the Sudan and has a council flat already,&rsquo; adds Abdul. &#8216;I want one, too, of my own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He isn&rsquo;t the only one. I hear very similar stories from other students in Salford. They come from Angola, from Somalia, and Ukraine  &mdash;  countries with no discernible link to Britain. Yet all confidently expect to get a council house.</p>
<p>Just how Hazel Blears would react to this is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Just a few months ago, Dr David Cutts, a senior academic at Manchester University&rsquo;s Institute for Social Change, warned that the MP last won her seat by only 14,000 votes.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Such Labour seats could be vulnerable to a more extremist candidate with a mobilised base. This could happen in places like Salford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, these words were lapped up by the contingent of would-be BNP councillors in Salford. They include a former managing director of a packaging company, a railway worker and the owner of a driving school. Every so often they set up a stall on a Saturday at the Salford shopping precinct. They hand out leaflets which are more moderate in tone than in the past.</p>
<p>&#8216;The BNP don&rsquo;t hate anyone,&rsquo; states one, ungrammatically. &#8216;We just want to make sure that our own people aren&rsquo;t turned into second-class citizens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another adds in a deceptively friendly tone: &#8216;It&rsquo;s wrong that immigrants who&rsquo;ve never paid a penny into our system can come to Britain and go to the front of the queue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A third makes it clear where they are coming from. &#8216;Teach the politicians who have ignored you a lesson. In 2009, everyone can vote BNP in the Euro Elections.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Few born and bred Salfordians would disagree with their sentiments. Certainly, on one Saturday before Christmas, every single leaflet from the BNP stall was carried off to be read by eager locals, many of them women.</p>
<p>When the Right-wing activists ran out of magazines and literature there was, according to one shopkeeper who was watching, nearly a riot as the disappointed were turned away empty-handed.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should serve as a timely warning to Hazel Blears and the rest of the New Labour hierarchy, who many feel have let down the ordinary people who put them in power.<br>

			<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come to desperation for whites to see the negativity of multiculturalism.  Dispossession/Disenfranchisement is multiculturalism.  Perhaps they need only blame themselves&hellip;.. or their sellout cowardly parents.<br>

<p>Yes, because it&rsquo;s such an extremist proposition that the native people of your own country actually have roofs over their head.  What the BNP has to do to move into the mainstream is to suggest that young native white Britons experience the joys of homelessess, so it seems.</p>

			<p>Britain is fortunate: When a mainstream political party spits in the face of its constituency - like it says in the article - the voters divert to the BNP.</p>
<p>But here in the USA, we&rsquo;re not so lucky&hellip;</p>
<p>When the Republicans spit in the face of their constituency - and they have, judging from their nomination of John McAmnesty for president, their support for illegal immigration, etc. - we don&rsquo;t have a mainstream party to divert to.</p>
<p>It would be great if we had an American National Party that represents <i>our</i> interests.</p>

<p>Saying that their multicultural injustices are &#8220;Fueling the fires of extremism,&#8221; without realizing it is they who are the extremists, probably never occurred to them.</p>
<p>The poor fools have their heads where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine, and they&rsquo;re not even remotely congnizant of the fact that they have been duped into causing their own destruction.</p>
<p>Incidentally, what are they going to do when their economy crashes right along with the US?  Surely, they aren&rsquo;t so dense as to expect they&rsquo;re not going to crash just like the rest of the world are they?</p>
<p>Not enough housing.  Not enough jobs.  Too much social benefits being paid out, while tax revenues decline, and yet they&rsquo;re talking about taking in more crime and poverty dregs from the third world.</p>
<p>Are they really that gullible, or is it arrogance that makes them feel as if they can pursue their idiocy uninterrupted?</p>
<p>Such incompetence, yet they sneeringly feel as if they are so superior they must tell us how to live and whom to bring into this country, although they&rsquo;re so lacking in basic intelligence they&rsquo;re stupidly creating an explosive situation that could erupt at any time, and most certainly will as the jobs are eliminated.</p>

			<p>In her (1950!) book, <i>Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, Hahhah Arendt noted that so-called &#8220;racialist&#8221; political parties in Europe were hardly exponents of Anglo-American buccaneer capitalism, but instead were socially conscious. </p>
<p>Fifty-five years later, Jonah Goldberg, in his <i>Liberal Fascism</i> re-emphasized that Italian Fascism and German National Socialism, and other parties of like ilk elsewhere in Europe, were parties of the <i>Left</i>.</p>
<p>Here in the U. S. A., &#8220;movement &#8216;Conservatism&rsquo;&#8221; is the political tendency which espouses the regime of the Bourgeoisie as Rulership of the State, endorsing this condition where it is present in any country, advocating this condition in countries where it is absent   &mdash;   sometimes &#8220;making gunpowder talk&#8221; in support of such advocacy abroad, to this country&rsquo;s detriment at home.</p>
<p>If the BNP has its collective head on straight, its platform will seem horrifically &#8220;socialist&#8221; to American <i>neo</i>-&#8220;Conservatives,&#8221; but based on the principle of reciprocal restricted altruism and <i>non</i>-involvement in unnecessary foreign adventurism. </p>

			<p> They use the phone box in the lobby to call their families with phone cards given to them by the council,</p>
<p>Free housing and other benefits cover all their other needs including free cars furnished by the council.  But phone cards as well?  I suppose they couldn&rsquo;t be expected to spend any of their extremely generous benefit money on phone cards.</p>

			<p>I disagree with the whole idea that government is supposed to hand anyone a subsidized apartment.  If you don&rsquo;t want to sleep on Mommy and Daddy&rsquo;s couch get off your tail and get a job that pays the rent.  Of course immigrants shouldn&rsquo;t get subsidized housing either.  And it would be much easier for the British working class to find jobs if they weren&rsquo;t always being given to immigrants.</p>
<p>Whether the BNP hates anyone can certainly be debated, but there is no question that Labour, the Liberals, the Conservatives, the Democrats, and the Republicans hate the white working class.<br>

			<p>Good signs hopefully it will be like Italy with the left destroyed by the respectable right party and the post facist party.<br>
I can&rsquo;t feel much sympathy though as these people voted labour into power through their own greed and stupidity and thats a cost I have had to bear.</p>

			<p>       Yes, good politicians have to hide the hate if they are<br>
to have a chance at getting elected. By the Hate, is legitimate.<br>
The situation is hateful in the extreme. If you don&rsquo;t hate it,<br>
you have something wrong with you. What kind of system asks its<br>
candidates to emasculate themselves in this way? Real men are<br>
capable of hate and given the nature of our society, have in<br>
fact, alot of hate. This is entirely understandable, justified,<br>
and even praiseworthy. The real questions are how to express your<br>
hatred in a just way and secondly, if you can&rsquo;t express it, how<br>
to keep it from eating you alive.</p>

<p>So 1.7 million taxpaying Britons being displaced by an invading hoard of &#8220;migrants&#8221; isn&rsquo;t &#8220;extremist,&#8221; but the BNP&rsquo;s positions are?</p>
<p>Come now, and then come again?</p>
<p>Labour and the Tories have spent the last 2 decades battling over how to most comfortably and &#8220;tolerantly&#8221; accommodate these invaders, but yet the BNP is seen as the non-mainstream party? What next, will magic beans be seen as the UK&rsquo;s only chance at a gold egg manufacturing goose? </p>

			<p>The BNP is doing a great job.  Just visit their website (http://bnp.org.uk/) and you&rsquo;ll quickly see the right way to organize and sustain a white political party.  </p>
<p>We should learn from the BNP.  We really don&rsquo;t have a similar political party in the USA.  </p>
<p>Some have tried to build such a party here, but they&rsquo;ve never gotten as far as the BNP.  One reason for this (but not the only one by far) is that the BNP is building from the bottom up, instead of from the top down. </p>

<p>Sue Reid, Daily Mail - London</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s  half the problem; It is the perception of a dark man from Sudan being handsome to Sue Reid.  One half of the seduction is done right there and she doesn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
<p>The BNP has a lot of work to do because it sounds like the main reason that people are listening to them these days is because they think the BNP will get them a flat tomorrow.  I wonder how many of these young single British women have babie that are genetically English?  Men usually see the tribal angles first because it is a biological imperative.  Women get seduced and then simply want to satisfy their babies needs, regardless of who fathered it.</p>
<p>It is going to take a lot more than a flat to make you British.  But it will be a great day when White Working Class British demonstrate in London for equal rights as English with British ancestry.</p>

			<p>Britain is so much farther along the road to hell than we are  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s simply no comparison.  This piece was stunning.</p>

&#8220;Perhaps this should serve as a timely warning to Hazel Blears and the rest of the New Labour hierarchy, who many feel have let down the ordinary people who put them in power&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Brits are lucky. Apparently they only have one political party to blame for the treachery that is being directed against them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last week, a government report from the Whitehall department of Communities Minister Hazel Blears warned that the crisis has resulted in a surge of popularity for extremist groups, including the British National Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gall of this loathsome socialist harpie!  To refer to a legitimate british political party that represents the interests of britons as &#8220;extremist&#8221;.  Labour is the extremist party.</p>
<p>I found this article extremely depressing, not so much because of the nature of the outrage, but because of its portrayal of the british working class as a mob of lazy, irresponsible, clueless welfare-addled state wards.  What happened to that old English pluck?  Now it seems to be &#8220;Oi guv, give us a phone-card&#8221;.  These must be the Eloi of whom H.G. Wells wrote.</p>
<p>Still, if anyone is to get a government handout, it should be them, not some foreign interlopers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Some have tried to build such a party here, but they&rsquo;ve never gotten as far as the BNP. One reason for this (but not the only one by far) is that the BNP is building from the bottom up, instead of from the top down.</p>
<p>Posted by JPT at 8:35 PM on January 12&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly right.  Attempts at third parties here have always started with a Presidential candidate (Rooseveldt, Anderson, Perot).  When the man at the top of the ticket fails - as he inevitably must the first time out - people loose interest and the party dies.  The way to do it is by targeting selected house seats and state legislature districts - by building a legislative party.</p>

			<p>The average IQ for Whites is 100, with a standard deviation of 15.  That means that one out of six Whites has an IQ no better than the average American Black.  (Since educated Whites choose to have fewer children than the less well educated, I think it likely that the average is dropping.)  Many of these Britons looking for a free apartment are from that unfortunate sixth.  They will not be the saviors of our race.  They are the model of a liberal&rsquo;s caricature of a racially conscious White.  Theodore Dalrymple, a British physician, has written a book about them, &#8220;Life at the Bottom.  <br>
     Despite all that, they are our people, and we owe them more than we owe any outlander.  Many of them could lead productive lives if useful work was available.  They may be common laborers by nature and no more, but that is far preferable to having non-Whites do the dirty work of the Western world.  </p>

			<p>The real Recession/Depression has yet to begin. The economy in Britain is going to get much much worse. It will get interesting when there is no longer a way to make sure every family has three squares a day. Then it will come down to who eats, and who does not eat. Britain (as well as the States) will no doubt have some interesting times ahead of them.</p>

			<p>The BNP is coming on great. Its not an extremist party - its simply a party that stands up for the natives of the British islands - just like parties that stood against colonialism and indiginous rights across the world. Parties in fact that are lauded for their principled stand for indiginous rights.</p>
<p>Just like freedom struggles across the world from Gandhi to Mandela we are fighting for the rights of the indiginous people of the UK.</p>
<p>The working claases, who for so long have habitually (blindly!) voted Labour, are waking up to what the Marxist multiculturalists have done to our once beautiful contry.</p>
<p>Violent Crime, Terrorism, Disease, overcrowding, Sharia Law, Gun crime, Drugs etc etc. Things that were almost unheard of back in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. All our present troubles stem from mass immigration.</p>
<p>If the BNP gets in then perhaps immigrants will be as rare in the UK as white people in India, Pakistan and many African countries.</p>
<p>They won their freedom and can now live amongst their own.</p>
<p>The ordinary British also deserve that same right.</p>
<p>We never asked for the Empire nor did we ask for mass invasion by third world colonisers.</p>
<p>Its about time we took control of our country.</p>

<p>Nah, she&rsquo;s just putting that in to hopefully avoid being called racist. &#8216;See, I love them&rsquo; slipped in as defence.</p>
<p>GetBackJack</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little point in insulting the victims. Point is though, anti-racism is so drummed into the British people from childhood onwards, that you wonder if they can step out of it for long enough to secure their own interests. I don&rsquo;t know, brainwashing doesn&rsquo;t work that way, but the brainwashing is pretty shallow, it can be undone, especially with strong arguments.</p>

			<p>If I am reading this and other similar articles correctly we can move to England and get a free apartment, money, food, lights, car, and now even a phone card. Stupid us,, why are we here working when life could be so easy. Nobody should work, everybody should be on the government dole everywhere!! Of course blacks get all or most of this here but us whites need to move to England for the good life on welfare!!  KF</p>

			<p>   I am truly saddened by the misfortunes of these white Brits. Maybe, just maybe, they will start to see the intentions of the labour(communist) government that is destroying their country. For God&rsquo;s sake, join the British National Party. The BNP is the only political party that cares about the British people. Join the BNP and save your country and yourselves. Revolt against labour and the conservative parties, they are both anti-white. Join the true British working class party. Join the BNP.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree, Anonymous!</p>
<p>I feel that we, as European Americans, have always been independent and thought and acted individually.  However, now that we are becoming a minority on our own soil, we must start to think as a group.  Our survival depends on it!</p>
<p>HOORAY for Nick Griffin and his ever-growing group, the BNP!</p>

<p>Tho a racial consciousness may indeed come from within the GOP, I would disagree with your statement (about their loyalty to the GOP). Blind love for and loyalty to the GOP went out when Nixon failed, if indeed there was ever &#8216;loyalty&rsquo; to the Republican party itself. Maybe there&rsquo;s someone out there who literally worships money and has loyalty to the GOP? </p>

<p>On another note, I love the part about the sudanese man being handsome, while the three BNP members are ungrammatical and deceptive.  Has this woman ever even seen a sudanese man?  Handsome is the last thing that comes to mind.</p>

			<p>My God, what in the world took the British so long to complain that they were being made third class citizens in their own land. I guess they take it all lying down just like Americans do with illegal immigration.</p>

Actually, that&rsquo;s already too far down stream to be effective in many cases.  The way to start is by volunteering for unpaid committee positions in town and city governments and then to use those positions to run for school boards, city councils, water boards, etc.  Along the way, you&rsquo;ll learn who all the real players are and you&rsquo;ll build contacts for ever higher offices. <br>

			<p> It&rsquo;s very interesting that the writer speaks of a &#8220;benefit culture&#8221; and that it has caused many members of &#8220;the white working class&#8221; to stop looking for work and start looking for handouts. Does the writer really believe that all these immigrants came to Britain because they wanted to work hard at jobs low on the employment ladder?</p>
<p> Isn&rsquo;t it possible that some of these immigrants   &mdash;   make that MANY of them   &mdash;   came to Britain to jump on the benefits gravy train offered to them there, which was far better than what they could get in their home countries? Doesn&rsquo;t take Einstein to figure out the answer to THAT one.</p>

			<p>The only realist in the GOP was Pat Buchanan.  His 1992 &#8220;culture war&#8221; speech at the GOP convention was excellent, and he was sent into exile for it.  His continuing stream of books are worth reading, especially &#8220;State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.&#8221;  </p>
<p>While I am not an historian, I think that sometimes third parties have platform policies often absorbed into mainstream parties.  For example, much of Eugene Debs is in the policies of the Democrats of today.  More knowledgeable Amreners might discuss how a third party (American National Party) might change the GOP.   I don&rsquo;t believe that any other party other than Democrats and Republicans will be dominant soon, though the Republicans might fade away as the Whigs did. </p>

			<p>Sue Reid clearly needs to brush up her own knowledge of grammar. The BNP leaflet she quotes is perfectly grammatical, since the BNP are being treated as an organisation comprising many individuals, and a plural verb is therefore perfectly appropriate. This point is reinforced by the use of a plural pronoun in the next sentence. Of course this is just a cheap shot by a two-bit journalist, who knows full well that the average tabloid-reader has an even poorer grasp of grammar than she has. </p>
<p>The ruling elites are so disconnected from the nation that they govern, that they seriously imagined the indigenous population were just going to acquiesce meekly in their replacement by immigrants (with the help of rather a lot of intimidation and propaganda). They seem genuinely surprised and disappointed at the rejection of their multicultural Utopia. </p>
<p>The English white working class should take to the streets and make their displeasure both seen and heard (although we can expect a brutal response from both the police and the &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; thugs). They will certainly do well to throw their full support behind the BNP come election time.</p>
