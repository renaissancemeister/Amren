<h1>Former Surgeon General, Now Local Hospital Executive Faces Felony Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Pacheco, Orlando Sentinel, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Antonia Coello Novello, the former Surgeon General of the United States (1990&#150;1993), is accused of ordering state employees to take her on personal shopping sprees, water her house plants, buy her groceries and move her furniture, among other accusations, during her 7-year tenure as New York&rsquo;s Health Commissioner, according to a report released today by the Inspector General of New York.</p>
<p>Novello, 64, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was the first woman and first Hispanic to serve as U.S. surgeon general. Novello, born in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, was often praised by Democrats and Republicans for her talent and promise to bring emphasis to pediatric care.</p>
<p>The investigation shows that the 2,540 hours of overtime generated by her staff cost Albany taxpayers nearly $50,000. A spokeswoman at Florida Hospital said she would comment to the Orlando Sentinel later today. High-profile criminal defense attorney E. Stewart Jones, in Albany, NY, is representing Novello.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, one of Novello&rsquo;s guards, who also picked up her dry cleaning and stored her car at his home, complained that the former health commissioner &#8220;would yell at him in public if he mishandled her packages.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report shows security guards transported her mother to the Newark, NJ airport to catch flights to Puerto Rico; a Health Department investigator in New York City was used as a driver, taking Novello on shopping sprees to Macy&rsquo;s and Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>An Albany guard was also ordered to work Christmas Day in 2006  &mdash;  after her term as health commissioner had ended  &mdash;  to drive Novello to Newark. He was then pressured to charge vacation time and use his own car to pick her up.</p>

			<p>In 2000 this most accomplished doctress changed the name of the NYS &#8220;Office of Minority Health&#8221; to the &#8220;Office of Emerging Minorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>This caused some mild outrage in the press and among political figures, so she was compelled to keep the official name, but used the new designation when possible.</p>

<p>MINORITY HEALTH AGENCY SPURS MAJOR SLAP<br>
By JOE MAHONEY DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 19th 2000, 2:14AM</p>
<p>ALBANY - A name-game flap erupted at the Capitol yesterday after state Health Commissioner Antonia Novello rechristened her agency&rsquo;s Office of Minority Health as the Office of Emerging Majorities.</p>
<p>The move - perhaps the first by a government bureaucracy to jump ahead of projected demographic shifts - was immediately pounced on by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s feel-good political correctness that has just gone off the charts,&#8221; said Assemblyman Thomas Kirwin (R-Newburgh). &#8220;It&rsquo;s goofy, even though it may have laudable intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Totally extraneous,&#8221; was the reaction of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan). &#8220;I just don&rsquo;t know why she would do it,&#8221; he told Albany radio station WROW.</p>
<p>Health Department spokesman John Signor said Novello - a Pataki appointee who once worked for President George Bush - &#8220;wants to put a renewed emphasis on health services to underserved communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signor said the office is striving to make a variety of health programs accessible to minority-group members.</p>
<p>Novello, who is Puerto Rican, also views the name change as &#8220;an internal tool to motivate staff,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But it turns out Albany can have it both ways. Signor said the agency&rsquo;s official name will remain the Office of Minority Health because a change would require legislative approval.</p>
<p>However, it will be referred to as the Office of Emerging Majorities whenever possible, he said.</p>
<p>Said Kirwan: &#8220;If they need a unanimous vote to change the name, they aren&rsquo;t going to get one.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I think she&rsquo;s the same one who was put in charge of a minority affairs department, after her stint as Surgeon General, which had a sign up on her door that read something like:  &#8220;Ofice of Minority&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221; and she changed the words to say, &#8220;Office of the Emerging Majority, showing a blatant anti-white, pro-non-white bias.</p>
<p>When Bush I appointed her Attorney General the first thing she did was begin an incessant whine about improving conditions for Hispanics everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s appointing people like this and catering to non-whites that cause these corrupt politicians to lose their base, which results in their trying to garner votes from non-whites who wouldn&rsquo;t vote for them if Idi Amin were running against them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Perot took nearly 20 million votes away from Bush, causing him to lose, and allowing one of the worst presidents in history to get elected.</p>

			<p>I swear there is nobody, in any profession that exists, that can match the shear arrogance and entitlement attitude of most of the politicians in the U.S. The abused American citizenry has got to wake-up and seriously start to cut these people down to size.</p>

			<p>This comes right after she was a named one of the &#8220;Florida Hispanic Leaders of 2008&#8221;.   <i>!Que Sorpresa!</i><br>

<p>I wonder if any of the latino pride organizations, which were selling posters of her for &#8220;Hispanic Heritage Month&#8221;, will quietly remove her from their future propaganda?  <br>

			<p>&#8220;I wonder if any of the latino pride organizations, which were selling posters of her for &ldquo;Hispanic Heritage Month&rdquo;, will quietly remove her from their future propaganda?&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason why not? Because Hispanics are not ashamed of this kind of behavior by their public officials. Every aspiring Hispanic politician dreams of a day when he or she too might get treated with such respect and collect their share of taxpayer swag.</p>

			<p>I am very much afraid that affirmative action is coming to the health system.  It will be the same as affirmative action in jobs and collge admissions, taking health care from whites to give to non whites.</p>
<p>Already the organ transplant programs have developed a protocol that gives blacks first chance at livers.  That is why whites should stop donating organs.  Why should we if our organs are given to blacks, asians, hispanics, indians,  middle easterners and other immigrants who refuse to donate either organs or blood instead of American whites who are the only ethnic group in this country who donate organs and blood in significant amounts?</p>
<p>Every day I see posters about minority health care conferences.  Every day I get email about minority health care.  There is never anything about health care for all or health care for whites.</p>
<p>For 50 years our government has denied whites employment and education because we are white.  There are mnay indications that our government is beginning to deny health care to us because we are white. And just in time for the old age of the American white baby boomers.  What a coincidence.</p>
