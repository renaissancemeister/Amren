<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-01-29-ms13_N.htm">FBI: Burgeoning Gangs Behind up to 80% of US Crime</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Johnson, USA Today, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Criminal gangs in the USA have swelled to an estimated 1 million members responsible for up to 80% of crimes in communities across the nation, according to a gang threat assessment compiled by federal officials.</p>
<p>The major findings in a report by the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Gang Intelligence Center, which has not been publicly released, conclude gangs are the &#8220;primary retail-level distributors of most illicit drugs&#8221; and several are &#8220;capable&#8221; of competing with major U.S.-based Mexican drug-trafficking organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;A rising number of U.S.-based gangs are seemingly intent on developing working relationships&#8221; with U.S. and foreign drug-trafficking organizations and other criminal groups to &#8220;gain direct access to foreign sources of illicit drugs,&#8221; the report concludes.</p>
<p>The gang population estimate is up 200,000 since 2005.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Growing threat&rsquo; on the move</b></p>
<p>The report says about 900,000 gang members live &#8220;within local communities across the country,&#8221; and about 147,000 are in U.S. prisons or jails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s other findings:</p>
<p>oLast year, 58% of state and local law enforcement agencies reported that criminal gangs were active in their jurisdictions, up from 45% in 2004.</p>
<p>oMore gangs use the Internet, including encrypted e-mail, to recruit and to communicate with associates throughout the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>oGangs, including outlaw motorcycle groups, &#8220;pose a growing threat&#8221; to law enforcement authorities along the U.S.-Canadian border. The U.S. groups are cooperating with Canadian gangs in various criminal enterprises, including drug smuggling.</p>
<p>Assistant FBI Director Kenneth Kaiser, the bureau&rsquo;s criminal division chief, says gangs have largely followed the migration paths of immigrant laborers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>MS-13 far-flung from L.A. incubator</b></p>
<p>One group that continues to spread despite law enforcement efforts is the violent Salvadoran gang known as MS-13.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kaiser says the street gang is in 42 states, up from 33 in 2005. &#8220;Enforcement efforts have been effective to a certain extent, but they (gang members) keep moving,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among law enforcement efforts:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davidson County, Tenn., Sheriff Daron Hall, whose jurisdiction includes Nashville, says MS-13 started growing there about five years ago, corresponding with an influx of immigrant labor.</p>
<p>Last April, county officials began checking the immigration status of all arrestees. &#8220;We know we have removed about 100 gang members, including MS-13,&#8221; to U.S. authorities for deportation, Hall says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Escorza [Aaron Escorza, chief of the FBI&rsquo;s MS-13 National Gang Task Force] says a &#8220;revolving door&#8221; on the border has kept the gang&rsquo;s numbers steady  &mdash;  about 10,000 in the U.S.  &mdash;  even as many illegal immigrant members are deported.</p>
<p>The FBI, which has two agents in El Salvador to help identify and track members in Central America and the United States, plans to dispatch four more agents to Guatemala and Honduras, Escorza says.</p>

			<p>Another reason to stop the illegal aliens from getting in.  Every American you talk to wants to lock the borders, yet our government turns a deaf ear and panders to the liberals and big business.</p>

			<p>If each and every county in each and every State and Commonwealth would check the immigration status of each and every arrestee, and actually send off those who are illegal for deportation, then the immigration problem in this Country will be lessened considerably.</p>
<p>Of course, liberals (and false-hearted &#8220;conservatives&#8221;) will never let this happen, and that is the true tragedy in this story. </p>

			<p>While I don&rsquo;t doubt that street gangs are a big problem, I doubt the notion that 80% of all crimes in the U.S. are linked to gangs.  In order to arrive at that figure, they have to have a very generous definition of a gang-linkable crime.  For instance, if you&rsquo;re jacked at gunpoint for money so that the robber can buy dope from a gang, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider it a gang crime, but it seems that the FBI does.  Also, there is the question of what is and is not a gang, and what is and is not a gang member.  Both definitions are very malleable, and if you&rsquo;re someone who makes a living in the business (or rather, the hustle) of gang mitigation and prevention, you have much the incentive to fudge the statistics for the worse.</p>

			<p>Of course it stands to reason, the vast majority of gang members are either Mexican (Hispanic), or Black. Which means police are not permitted to use racial profiling to question a suspicious looking character, his pockets bulging with drugs or stolen loot.</p>
<p>What a pity we can&rsquo;t follow the example of some third-world countries&hellip; and simply EXECUTE drug traffickers on the spot. Saving Americans a lot of grief, a lot of wasted money that would have to be spent on a lengthy trial. With the perps usually getting little more than a figurative slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, I just realized my error. I&rsquo;ve been ASSURED on a local TV news blogsite, Mexicans and Blacks collectively are no more prone to crime and criminal acts than Whites. No matter how the news stories seem to indicate the opposite.</p>

			<p>FBI Director Robert Mueller believes all one million Hispanic gang members are white, unless one Aztec kills another Aztec. At that point, the dead Aztec suddenly becomes Hispanic, dying at the hands of a racist white.<br>
Meuller also recently broke off group hugs with CAIR after coming to the conclusion that Muslims believe in Jihad against infidels. He&rsquo;s still seaching for those elusive &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslims with which he can do further outreach.</p>

			<p>80% seems a little high. I assume that plenty in the FBI can&rsquo;t think out of the box.(I&rsquo;d hope for the opposite.) It&rsquo;s easier to go after those criminals that can be labeled as gang members. </p>
<p>(An older male friend suggested to me that the FBI is big on hiring more special agents right now. He knows of my interest in cultures, religions, and the Middle East. If I didn&rsquo;t understand what I did, with my being physically in shape and intelligent, I might be interested.  &mdash;  Bigger government on the rise./Anyone and everyone running rampant in/out/across this country.  &mdash;   <br>
No thanks, I want no part.  &mdash;   It seems so easy to get a job with these types of organizations these days.)</p>

			<p>We could take a stand now against illegal immigrants. We could put aside our quarrels and defend our country from the foreign invaders. I was driving home today and I saw some Hispanics teens jumping on three undersize white kids. They have now become quiet common here in Florida. I left California because they destroyed it royaly. I would have helped but there were to many of them. Police came and they scattered.</p>
<p>We need to train our kids to fight and defend our country from illegals. America is still worth saving.</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE IF WE DON&rsquo;T ACT NOW:</p>

<p>No question that that&rsquo;s accurate.  The problem is when we go to sites like CNN and click &#8216;Crime&rsquo; we see a preponderance of White perpetrators.  CourtTV is another one where we see mostly White criminals.  Propaganda like this is what is making White people become self-haters.  </p>

When speaking of gangs, we all know who they&rsquo;re referring to. So 80% of crime is committed by black and hispanic gang members.</p>
<p>That leaves 20%. Who makes up this percentage? Is it 20 white or is it largely black and hispanic non-gang members?</p>

			<p>Actually you would be surprised to know how many small towns in California are full of gang crime. Small agricultural towns like Orange Cove, Selma, Woodlake, Shafter, Arvin, Pixley, Cutler, Orosi, and Deleno to name just a few, are about 98% Mexican and they have drive by shootings and gang stabbings almost every night.<br>
Almost all young Mexican men belong to some type of gang or another and they run around looking for targets. If you look at the crime reports, almost every single criminal has a last name that ends in &#8220;z&#8221; and their names aren&rsquo;t Schultz.</p>

			<p>Every politician in national, state and local government who ignores the horrendous problem of illegal immigration should be made to stand in front of his/her constitutients or go on TV and explain fully why they believe the millions of illegal immigrants, pouring into our country, is good for us, the economy, and the enviornment. Let the public question these elected officals - call their hands - and then let them hem and haw as they try to explain their reasons. If they&rsquo;d admit the truth, they would have to say they profit from illegal immigration. Only the most liberal of liberals can truthfully say, &#8220;it&rsquo;s for the love of my fellow man that I displace Americans with foreigners who disregarded our laws to sneak into this country and wage an all-out war on every facet of American life. Let&rsquo;s see them all explain with a straight face. Trators, the lot of them.</p>

			<p>This report encapsulates why Arizona (my original home), not to mention California and Florida, have become virtually uninhabitable.  Even the small towns have been overrun by gangs, and what remains of law and order has been outgunned.  Most alarmingly of all, this wave of gang power is moving north, even outside its traditional power centers in the SW region.</p>
<p>Most of my old friends and their families have moved out of Arizona and the neighboring states.  Some even out of the country as North America in general is overrun.  (Anyone with Dutch, German or Italian ancestry has almost instant resettlement rights in their ancestral land  &mdash;   which these days, is probably in much better shape than the States are becoming, let alone even more overrun ex-Western countries like Australia and Britain.)  And most appalling of all  &mdash;   the politicians in these places are overwhelmed by PC, and the sense of Western nationalism in these places has become far too weak in them to mount a defense.</p>

			<p>June - I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more, but how can we actually accomplish something like this?  We know what&rsquo;s going on, but how can we bring it to the forefront and get the sheep (I mean citizens) to acknowledge the problems and then force our elected officials to do something about it?  How do we get people to band together and demand that our government address the problems?<br>

			<p>  While some of these gangs are home-grown, like the Bloods and the Crips, most have come to the country by open border immigration. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a society so stupid it imports a criminal underclass, but that is exactly what we have done. And for that matter, continue to do at an accelerated pace.</p>

			<p>   Back in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, the immigration people turned their backs and allowed millions of illegals to pour into this country for cheap labor for their friends in big business. All the while, good paying manufacturing jobs were leaving this country per NAFTA. Now the economy is in the toilet, the immigrants are all on welfare and the states are going broke. Gangs have exploded on the scene, and are quickly becoming a national security threat.The manufacturing base is gone, therefor there is no need for the service industry to service manufacturing&rsquo;s products. Hence, the gangs are making huge inroads into the immigrant neighborhoods and the blacks are trying to keep up with them. Drugs are a quick route to the money pit for all minorities. Big business and their friends in congress got us into this mess with their schemes to use cheap mexican labor. Now the banks are screaming for bailouts from the taxpayer, the same people that they screwed over in the first place. There is no shame in the hearts of business people. They all just looked for the short term, get rich quick scheme. Nobody took into account that once the good paying jobs were gone, that nobody could afford to buy their overpriced products. The one world economy is going to make it that much more diffcult to recover. We have a democrat controlled congress and a democrat president. They believe the way to solve problems is to throw money at it. Money we don&rsquo;t have to throw around. Liberal ideology has destroyed this country and a good part of the western world. Republican neo-cons and democratic communists are to blame for the mess we are in today. Balack Odummy has shown that he is more interested in attacking talk show hosts than working on fixing the economy. People,,, we are in trouble, big trouble.   </p>

			<p>I agree with question diversity.  What is gang related?  If Ramon who lives in apartment 12, and Jose who lives in apartment 23 of the same building barely know each other and each commits a separate crime are those 2 crimes considered gang related because the suspects know each other?</p>
<p>The FBI has in interest in increasing gang crime statistics because then they can take jurisdiction from local law enforcement.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Nation magazine recently reported that after hurricane Katrina, vigilantes killed several black men for simply walking through a neighborhood. &#8220;</p>
<p>Another lie by the marxist millionaires favorite anti white anti american rag.  During the worst of the looting, Blacks were not permitted to cross a bridge into a suburb of New Orleans.  That&rsquo;s all that happened, no evil white vigilantes shot any blacks during Katrina.</p>
<p>And contrary to the breathless media reports of dozens massacred in the superbowl and other areas, the murder rate in NOLA did not go up during Katrina. It decreased as people fled the city. </p>
<p>Some people were murdered, but by the usual black criminals.  Neither normal law abiding whites or blacks went on a murder spree, although many quite sensibly guarded their families, homes and businesses with firearms. </p>

			<p>In 1995 Janet Reno estimated the black and Hispanic street gangs to be about 500,000 members strong.  Today, just 13 years later, their numbers have doubled.  At that rate of increase each year brings in thousands of new recruits.</p>
<p>Most of them are disorganized, but there is some hard core elements that have a command structure which is similar to a military one, and they make decisions and dispense their brand of justice as if they were a military group.  Some of them have run for office in a few large urban areas, and many of them are on police forces and on active duty in the military.  Their main interest right now, however, seems to be establishing themselves as a political organization up front, and a criminal enterprise covertly, dealing mostly in drugs and contract murders.</p>
<p>Some black politicians, like Jesse Jackson, have given speeches at gang gatherings, calling them &#8220;the new frontier of the civil rights movement,&#8221; knowing full well who they&rsquo;re talking to and that they&rsquo;re some of the most vicious killers in the country today.  </p>
<p>Black leaders aren&rsquo;t the only group who accept their gangs as part of their tribesmen either.  High profile Hispanics openly encourage their gangs to retake the US and cross the border illegally, because they see themselves as having some kind of connection to all indian types in general, even though they have no direct blood connection to American indians. In other words, it&rsquo;s just a flimsy excuse to justify stealing someone else&rsquo;s territory. </p>
<p>Black and Hispanic leadership are fully aware that they have a military contingent at hand to call into action if they need them.  And they are constantly watchful that whites do not unite in any form in order to have what they would consider a force to counter them, and that&rsquo;s exactly why we hear so much hysterical screeching every time a couple of white guys get together.</p>
<p>Their intent is to increase their forces, while they divide whites and intimidate them into keeping quiet about any kind of citicizing at all of non-whites.  Their leftist white-hating friends are valuable co-horts in this effort.</p>
<p>And their tactics are working beautifully, because there are exactly zero whites in high positions who would dare say even the slightest remark against non-white misconduct and racist slurs, while at the same time spinlessly condemning other whites who have the guts to do so.</p>
<p>The problem today is in white leadership, not the white public at large.  That&rsquo;s one big reason why the non-white gangs are so successful.<br>

Simple, have a million man march on the White House like is happening across Europe right now.  The problem with US Whites is, they won&rsquo;t demand their rights until it too late. It has always worked for blacks; all they must do is riot, and they get section eight homes, free medical, and jobs they are unqualified to do.<br>

			<p>Blame a white man for all of these problems.  White men held the offices necessary to change the laws.  White men kept sending their sons to worthless wars.  <br>
White men refuse to have children.<br>
Why are white men so pathetic they can&rsquo;t even protect their own?  What nation allows it&rsquo;s own youth to be poisoned by outsiders?  The answer, only a wimpy white nation.<br>
I have no respect for white men left at this point.  You used to rule the world and now you can&rsquo;t even get it up without Viagra.<br>
Nice touch during the inauguration, watching Dick Cheney (old white man) getting wheeled away while the strong, young black man looked on proudly.<br>
Fantastic to know that my children will be a minority in their own nation that my ancestors overcame harsh conditions so white idiots could turn it over in one generation.<br>
White intelligence, what a joke!  More like arrogance.  Even supposedly inferior people would never willingly give up their nation.  Oh the intelligence.<br>

<p>Posted by margaret at 5:55 PM on January 31&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought the exact same thing when I saw that headline.  The feds are always trying to extend their jurisdiction.  By pushing street crime under the gangland heading, it can be claimed to be interstate and therefore the province of the FBI.  It is the volume of crime and the origin of the criminals which I am more concerned about, not their affiliation.  The FBI is primarily concerned with increasing its power.</p>

			<p>Sounds good to me. First you organize to defend the community and enforce the law. Next you organize to the defend the nation and enforce the Constitution. </p>

			<p>The premise of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is that two unlike groups, living together, will somehow benefit from each other by &#8220;learning&#8221; something of value from each other&rsquo;s cultures. If that is indeed the case, then it stands to reason that the MORE diverse the two groups are the more that each group can, should, and will, learn. Hmmmmm</p>
<p>Tell me, are these MS 13 gangs more extreme than the average illegal Hispanic flooding into our country?  If the illegal Hispanics are somehow good for us, shouldn&rsquo;t this extreme element then, which creates even greater diversity, be even better? Moreover, does anyone want to hazard a guess as to just what the MS 13 gangs have learned from their association from us?</p>
<p>Well then, the liberals would argue of course, that the MS 13 group is just an unhealthy reaction by the radical right to an overblown tiny minority of an otherwise beneficial, albeit  illegal, larger group.  </p>
<p>Really? Thats kind of like having every tenth cup of McDonald&rsquo;s coffee coming with a couple of drops of arsenic already added   &mdash;   at no additional charge! </p>
<p>When will sanity ever return?       </p>

			<p>Nordic is correct:</p>
<p> http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/fugitives/vc/murders/vc_murders.htm</p>
<p>Why not call these brown skinned Mexicans and assorted South American criminals Hispanic? Why &#8216;White(Hispanic)&rsquo;?<br>
Are these &#8216;White&rsquo; criminals included in the White crime stats?<br>
Arc.<br>

			<p>Stated by oxymoron, high white IQ at 11:02 PM on February 1:</p>
<p>&#8220;White men refuse to have children &hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Response: White Men have children only if they can support them; unlike minorities who get welfare for each child. In the 1970s, Whites were told we needed fewer children to stop over population &hellip; we complied.  Today, our government says we need immigration to pay for SSI and taxes; what the government fails to mention is 90% of minority immigrants receive more in social services than they pay into the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Why are white men so pathetic they can&rsquo;t even protect their own? What nation allows it&rsquo;s own youth to be poisoned by outsiders? The answer, only a wimpy white nation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Response: Because White men have been neutered by our anti-White laws preventing us to even form White organizations, have White schools or communities, or even say a one word against the pagan minorities. We are being poisoned by outsiders to destroy the last vestige of civilization &hellip; the reason is simple: there can be no New World Government with our pesky sovereign nations standing in their way. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;I have no respect for white men left at this point. You used to rule the world and now you can&rsquo;t even get it up without Viagra&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Response: This is to be expected with 50 years of brainwashing from our Communist news media, schools, and leaders of our government. As I have said, the Elites have neutered the White man&rsquo;s powers. The end result will be eventual massive civil unrest, which will be dealt with by our Police State, where all dissidents will end up in the Hitler Youth Camps &hellip; ah, I mean FEMA camps&hellip;</p>

			<p>In just reading the titles of Monday&rsquo;s articles, I want to throw up. How could anyone work for the FBI? They are not on our side. They&rsquo;ve helped create this mess. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve probably been one of the most outspoken anti-immigration foes over the last 5 years, but realistically, didn&rsquo;t we have these same gang problems, on the same population adjusted scale, from other immigrant groups like the Irish, the Italians and the Jews?</p>
<p>From my reading of American history, the first gang wars here were between the French, the English and the Indians.</p>
<p>Why should we demonize these new arrivals because a small minority of them make the same mistakes that small minorities of new arrivals have always made in America?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re being more than a tad hypocritical.</p>

			<p>Gangs are no joke but the police are more interested in getting their hands on vast sums of money and in acquiring more power so they need to inflate the gang menace as much as they can. Here in Boston, MA the cops maintained a couple of years ago that they had sources in El Salvador who could attest to the infiltration of terrorists into the US. It was claimed that Salvadoran gangs were spiriting them in. The trouble is there were a huge number of murders right here in the city that had gone unsolved. Let&rsquo;s not be chicken littles. Go to youtube and see the number of assaults by out-of-control cops. That should be our real worry.  </p>
