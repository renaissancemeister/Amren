<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN ANTI-RACISM campaign allowing the Federal Government to respond more quickly to ugly flare-ups such as the Cronulla riots and racial abuse of Sudanese migrants in Melbourne will be announced today.</p>
<p>The Diverse Australia Program will provide grants up to $150,000 for projects in areas where racial intolerance is found.</p>
<p>It will replace grants handed out by the Howard government to promote &#8220;living in harmony&#8221; after a review found there needed to be a stronger focus on racial intolerance.</p>
<p>But Harmony Day, an annual event held on March 21, will be retained after the review found it had high levels of support.</p>
<p>The parliamentary secretary for multicultural affairs, Laurie Ferguson, told The Age the anti-racism campaign would target outer suburbs with high migration levels, such as Noble Park in Melbourne and Rosemeadow in Sydney, the scene of a recent violent brawl.</p>
<p>A Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission report last month said young Sudanese in Dandenong were victims of systemic racial discrimination and were often too scared to go out.</p>
<p>Mr Ferguson said the Immigration Department was already working on projects in Camden in Sydney, where racial tension flared over a proposal for an Islamic school, with opponents placing pigs&rsquo; heads on the site along with Australian flags.</p>
<p>The former Living in Harmony program, which has run for 10 years, gave money to organisations conducting projects related to cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Mr Ferguson said he was concerned the program was &#8220;too soft&#8221;, with many activities preaching to the converted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not going to accomplish very much when people with good motivations sit around agreeing with each other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said areas with racial unrest were often in working-class outer suburbs that lacked institutions or community groups to apply for funding.</p>
<p>The Immigration Department review of the Living in Harmony program found there was strong support for its aims and efforts to bring people together, but for people who lived or worked in areas with high levels of cultural diversity, the perception of living in harmony was considered aspirational and unrealistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conversely, for those living in areas with low levels of diversity, the program name Living in Harmony suggested they were not living in harmony, which for these people was regarded as untrue,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>The review also found there was a perception that smaller ethnic groups were unlikely to be awarded grants, the application process was too difficult, projects that promoted integration over diversity were favoured and many schools were unaware of the program.</p>
<p>Under the community projects component of the Diverse Australia Program, smaller, inexperienced groups will be helped to apply for grants up to $5000, with a much simpler application process.</p>
<p>There will also be an increased focus on identifying areas where funding is required, including commissioning research into racial intolerance and analysing media reports.</p>
<p>The review said the new program name was also effective in conveying a move away from Living in Harmony, which was associated with &#8220;just tolerance&#8221;, to a more positive focus on respect and fair treatment.<br>

			<p><i>The parliamentary secretary for multicultural affairs, Laurie Ferguson, told The Age the anti-racism campaign would target outer suburbs with <b>high migration levels</b>, such as Noble Park in Melbourne and Rosemeadow in Sydney, the scene of a recent violent brawl.</i></p>
<p>If you cut through the P.C. nonsense, you&rsquo;ll notice that <i>white &#8220;racism&#8221; <b>rises proportionally</b> to the <b>increase in non-white &#8220;diversity&#8221;</b> of the area</i>:<br>
Yes, this is just like how Obama had the greatest supports in counties/states with either the <b>most</b>, or <b>least</b>, blacks in them (in regards to the population).</p>
<p><i>A Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission report last month said young <b>Sudanese</b> in Dandenong were victims of systemic racial discrimination and were often too scared to go out.<i></i></i></p>
<p>Yes Whitey - why can&rsquo;t you leave those poor Africans working to diversify YOUR country alone? (What did you think that the offspring of Third Worlders would do in a country where theft/rape/murder is not rewarded with equal brutality by said society?)</p>
<p><i>Mr Ferguson said the Immigration Department was already working on projects in Camden in Sydney, where racial tension flared over a proposal for an Islamic school, with opponents placing pigs&rsquo; heads on the site along with Australian flags.</i></p>
<p>Give it a few decades, and you&rsquo;ll be seeing white Christian heads along with &#8220;Australistan&#8221; flags.</p>
<p><i>He said <b>areas with racial unrest were often in working-class</b> outer suburbs that lacked institutions or community groups to apply for funding.</i></p>
<p>Because the &#8220;working-class&#8221; whites are - like their counterparts in the British Isles - coming to the slow realisation that <b>their elites, in both major parties, do not care for them anymore</b>:<br>
The elites sold their brethren-in-skin-shade-only down the river years ago, preferring a brown class of serfs that vote for whichever party offers them the most freebies to the descendants of the white founders of Australia.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Conversely, for those living in areas with <b>low levels of diversity</b>, the program name Living in Harmony suggested they were not living in harmony, which for <b>these people was regarded as untrue</b>the report said.<i></i></i></p>
<p>Surprise, surprise the &#8220;undiversified white&#8221; Australians believe that <i>they live in harmony</i>.</p>
<p>The only thing funny about this is in a decade or so <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1114604/The-migrants-just-dont-belong-Archbishop-York.html" rel="nofollow">a high-ranking Indian/Chinese Christian will be lamenting the decline of a &#8220;common Australian culture</a> - the inevitable result of declaring that any culture/ethnicity that parks it&rsquo;s behind in Australia is &#8220;Australian&#8221; too&hellip;</p>

			<p>You are never going to convince me that there is not some sinister force at work attacking the white countries of the world. EVERY SINGLE white country on the planet has an immigration problem and is infected with the stillborn ideology of multiculturalism/diversity. One or two countries, I might be convinced it&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory, but EVERY single one? No way.</p>

<p>I wonder if crime statistics relative to diversity could be the reason!!</p>

<p>I live in the cronulla area, and what they fail to mention time and time again is that (a) there was no riot, it was a large protest where a few scuffles broke out, and (b) it was caused by years of hate crimes against white australians by arabs, which everyone deliberately fails to mention. </p>

			<p>The Hypocrisy is just unbelievable; here in South Africa white people don&rsquo;t dare going out at night in areas that are predominantly black. Legally you can but you risk your own life. How many million of Rands are they spending to educate blacks to be less racist? You guessed right zero. They don&rsquo;t want us there and honestly I don&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>The Dutch court just ruled : &ldquo;stigmatization of a majority is impossible. Discrimination is something which by definition can affect only minorities.&rdquo; But if the minority is white the rule suddenly does not apply. The point is whether you are a white minority or majority legally it is you who are guilty by race and race only.</p>

			<p>I live in a suburb next to another where in the past few years a lot of Africans have been put in low-cost homes, and you can really say it&rsquo;s just one big clusterf***. There is a park between the two suburbs where they congregate in huge groups, carrying on making an awful racket, they were once throwing heavy rocks at each other one in what almost seemed like a gang war, threw rocks at my wife and I one night as we were going for a walk (then claimed they did not see us), break and enters going up&hellip;yet every time I pick up a newspaper or turn on the tv it seems the media seems to feel the need to remind us how good multiculturalism is for us, in case we didn&rsquo;t know already&hellip;</p>

<p>I know it seems that way when you try and think about the big abstract picture.  Our immigation policy in this nation was changed in 1965 to very obviously change the ethnic makeup of this nation for whatever purpose political and social and then Europe changes and Australia change their immigration policy as well.  You see whites in power very obviously turn against their own. Whatever it is it&rsquo;s been going on quite a long time.</p>

			<p>Is this a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; program or a military operation? I&rsquo;m not convinced there&rsquo;s a difference between the two.</p>

			<p>I live in the cronulla area, and what they fail to mention time and time again is that (a) there was no riot, it was a large protest where a few scuffles broke out, and (b) it was caused by years of hate crimes against white australians by arabs, which everyone deliberately fails to mention. </p>
<p>I live in the &#8216;Sunshine State&rsquo; and recall the news about the &#8216;riot&rsquo; very well&hellip;along with the VERY prolific media coverage of the vacant-headed protest about &#8216;racist Australia&rsquo; afterwards (I noticed a heavy presence of the predictable student left-wing groups and &#8216;Resistance&rsquo; and &#8216;The International Socialists&rsquo;).<br>
However, further research and the odd first-hand account confirmed what Zara mentioned above: It was NOT a riot, but a PROTEST againt the disgusting behaviour of these feral &#8216;Lebanese-Australians&rsquo; (you know the deal, gang-rape (they believe it to be truly hilarious), beating people for fun, usually on a 10 to one basis etc&hellip;<br>
I heard the usual, &#8216;OH every group has their share of bad apples&rsquo; line of debate, but I&rsquo;d say there is no doubt that there is a higher per-capita ratio of feral sociopaths in the Lebanese-Muslim community.<br>
Also, they conducted random &#8216;revenge attacks&rsquo; after the &#8216;Cronulla riot&rsquo;. I wonder whether a single arrest was ever made&hellip;</p>

<p>White people angry that Muslims rape white women is the problem.</p>
<p>Nice PC logic.</p>

<p>Just as in the United States, Australia now begins their endless series of programs and initiatives to spread harmony and love.</p>
<p>When Theory A fails, try Theory B. When Theory B fails, implement Theory C and on and on until you run out of letters or theories and you throw up your hands and say, &#8216;We just don&rsquo;t understand why nothing we do works&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No one can be forced to love or respect anyone.<br>

			<p>   Zara, I agree with you completely. I was on vacation in Australia when the Cronulla protest march happened. I was actually there, and I marched with my friends in Cronulla. THERE WAS NO RIOT. As usual, the msm talking heads in America got it wrong. ( as usual ) It&rsquo;s no wonder America is hated worldwide.</p>

			<p>The crux of the problem is, and has been from the start, that we white folk have stood by with our hands at our sides while our own elected officials have sold us and our countries out for votes, money and power. I have respect for the Aussies, the ones I met while I was over there were not afraid to speak their minds. It seems to me that they may have a better chance to nip their problem if not in the bud, then at least before it fully blooms. As for here in America, I only see two possible ways for us to fix the problem. The first is by regaining our intestinal fortitude and becoming politically aware and involved as a race.  The second is so obvious that I think I need not elaborate on it.<br>
 There is no palatable future whatsoever for us in continuing to &#8220;compromise&#8221;, accomodate and bend over backward as well as forward. At least not palatable to those of us who still have some concept of what this country is supposed to be about.</p>
