<h1>Black First Family &#8216;Changes Everything&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Blake, CNN, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jamaal Young was watching Barack Obama and his family greet an ecstatic crowd in Chicago, Illinois, on Election Night when he realized that something seemed wrong.</p>
<p>Obama didn&rsquo;t shout at his wife, Michelle, to shut up. The first lady didn&rsquo;t roll her eyes and tell Obama to act like a man. No laugh track kicked in, no one danced, and no police sirens wailed in the background.</p>
<p>Young had tuned in to celebrate the election of the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president. But he realized that he was witnessing another historic first. A black family was being featured as the first family, not the &#8220;problem family&#8221; or the &#8220;funny family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not here to entertain us,&#8221; says Young, a New York Press columnist. &#8220;Michelle Obama is not sitting around with her girlfriends saying, &#8216;My man ain&rsquo;t no good.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re not seeing this over -sexualized, crazy black family that, every time a Marvin Gaye song comes on, someone stands up and says, &#8216;Oh girl, that&rsquo;s my jam.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>The nation didn&rsquo;t just get a glimpse of its new first family when Obama and his family waved to the crowds on Inauguration Day. The Obamas are offering America a new way to look at the black family, Young and other commentators say.</p>
<p>America has often viewed the black family through the prism of its pathologies: single-family homes, absentee fathers, out of wedlock children, they say. Or they&rsquo;ve turned to the black family for comic relief in television shows such as &#8220;Good Times&#8221; in the &rsquo;70s or today&rsquo;s &#8220;House of Payne.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a black first family changes that script, some say. A global audience will now be fed images of a highly educated, loving and photogenic black family living in the White House for the next four years  &mdash;  and it can&rsquo;t go off the air like &#8220;The Cosby Show.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A new vision of black intimacy</b></p>
<p>The new first family could inspire some of their biggest changes within the black family itself, some say</p>
<p>In 1965, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democratic senator from New York, warned the nation about the rise of fatherless black families. He concluded that many black families were caught in a &#8220;tangle of pathology.&#8221; The pathology persists. The U.S. Census Bureau said that 69 percent of black women who gave birth in 2005 were unmarried (it was 31 percent for white mothers).</p>
<p>The relationship between Obama and his wife may help untangle some of that pathology, some black commentators say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the most natural and accessible first couple this country has ever had,&#8221; Brea says. &#8220;You see a politician give a peck on his wife&rsquo;s cheek after a speech and often it looks staged. When you look at them, you feel like that there&rsquo;s this chemistry and spark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several black women actually sighed as they talked about how much Obama seems to touch his wife and exchange soulful glances with her in public. They said Obama will show young black men how to treat women  &mdash;  and young black women how they should be treated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s apparent closeness to his wife may help untangle another pathology  &mdash;  the preoccupation with skin color and &#8220;looking white,&#8221; Bowles [Jacqueline Moore Bowles], president of Jack and Jill, says.</p>
<p>Bowles says some powerful black men marry women who are white or fair-skinned. Obama&rsquo;s decision to marry a darker-skinned woman like Michelle Obama shows black women that black can indeed be beautiful.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;They&rsquo;re not &#8216;Bebe&rsquo;s Kids&rsquo; &#8216;</b></p>
<p>But what about those blacks who haven&rsquo;t been considered &#8220;true sisters&#8221; or &#8220;true brothers.&#8221; A black first family changes that script as well, some say.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s family shows that there is not one way, but many ways for someone to claim membership in the black family, some say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s biracial background and his &#8220;exotic&#8221; upbringing relieves her of that pressure. Obama will help other blacks who come from multiracial backgrounds and immigrant communities to be comfortable in their own skin, she says.</p>

			<p>It is what it is.  70% of black families are single mothers without a dad around.  That is not a stereotype but a fact.  <br>

<p>Or maybe it can?</p>
<p>As usual, we find ourselves subjected to undiluted idiocy; it is<br>
superficial in the overall context, but 200 proof in terms of the actual &#8220;thought process.&#8221; Since when, did any white person here or otherwise, judge themselves by the &#8220;anointed&#8221; standards of their &#8220;leaders?&#8221; Moreover, in the USA, when was that  ever seen as a &#8220;gold standard&#8221; for whites? Yes, we have ideal situations on the boob-tube, as well as horrors: just compare &#8220;Leave It To Beaver&#8221; with &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; for that to sink in; but the larger question is, does that &#8220;universally&#8221; define our sense of self or culture? For that matter, why is it that white family life did not implode along with Richard Nixon&rsquo;s presidency in 1974?</p>
<p>There is a simple reason: for decent whites, thought normally precedes and mediates feelings, end of story. For nonwhites and Reds/multiculturalists generally, is it not the opposite in terms of a &#8220;process?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it is!</p>
<p>Why else do they expect Comrade BO to lead them all to a &#8220;promised land?&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>For this reason the Obama presidency is a blessing in disguise. Once you get over your shock of having a black president, you have to realize that he and his family are an excellent role model. He did everything right, just as we hope and expect all Americans, regardless of color, would do: he got an education, made something of himself, got married, responsibly raises his children, speaks flawless English without a trace of Ebonics and encourages others to do the same. Black Americans needed this enormous kick in the rear to realize it&rsquo;s not whitey that&rsquo;s holding them back. It&rsquo;s their own abominable behavior, So shape up! </p>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t change their genes except when Black men mate with White women.  Obama is NOT the nation&rsquo;s first Black President.  He is the nation&rsquo;s first half-White President.  The only way to improve Blacks is for them to miscegenate with people of other races.  This is what is happening now more and more.  The problem is one day there  will be very few White people left and those Whites will be a hated and hunted minority.  All the qualities of White people both physical and mental will have been appropriated by other races - and they will claim those qualities for themselves.  They want to destroy us, our heritage, traditions and history,take what we have and enjoy the spoils.</p>

			<p>I had a variety of reactions to this article&hellip;</p><p>As a senior citizen, I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard the term &#8220;role model&#8221; until I reached adulthood. The concept seems to have originated some time in the Forties or Fifties with sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model" rel="nofollow">Robert K. Merton</a>.</p><p>But I <i><b>did</b></i> have role models. They were <i><b>not</b></i> presidents, such as Roosevelt, Truman, or Eisenhower, in far-off Washington, whom I may have admired, respected, or ridiculed, but didn&rsquo;t try to imitate. No, they were my parents and other family members who set good examples for me. They had survived the Depression. They lived decent, upright lives. They put food on the table for me. Some of my relatives had defended our country during the World Wars. I&rsquo;m sure black children had similar feelings about people in their own communities who had set good examples of hard work, dignity and perseverance even in the face of segregation.</p><p>As a boy growing up at mid-century, I guess there <b><i>were</i></b> some famous role models I looked up to. At a time when baseball was truly the National Pastime, some of the athletes I admired were men like Teddy Ballgame, DiMag, Jackie, &#8220;Willie, Mickey and the Duke&#8221;, etc. Many of them weren&rsquo;t even white. I felt shame that, as a slow and clumsy child, I could never live up to the examples set for me by my heroes. Remember that this was a time before reporters pried into every dark corner of an athlete&rsquo;s life, and perhaps you&rsquo;ll forgive me if I worshipped these men as though they were gods. But at least I recognized that I could never be quite like one of them.</p><p>Times have changed since I was a boy. If children need to look up to public figures such as our president, rather than their own family members, for their examples, so be it. I didn&rsquo;t vote for Mr. Obama, and don&rsquo;t agree with his politics or policies. I worry about his past associations with the Chicago machine. But, I can only hope that he will comport himself in such a manner that young black men will seek to emulate his behavior in the way they treat their women and children and in the way they behave toward society.</p><p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s ancestry is one-half white, and both he and Michele Obama are obviously a part of that &#8220;talented ten percent&#8221; described by W. E. B. Dubois, so not all those young blacks who admire them will be able to match their achievements. I hope they will accept the obvious, but will still strive to live good and decent lives, rejecting the negative stereotypes of what we&rsquo;ve come to expect in black behavior.</p><p>We shall see.</p>

			<p>Blacks will be demanding 20% of the Fortune 100 companies; an increase in their wealth to be on par with white (10 times more that is); and that the prison population be more on par with the demographics of the country.  That&rsquo;s change you can believe in.</p>

			<p>The Cosby show was on the air eight seasons, from 1984 to 1992.  It has also been in syndication in Africa.</p>

			<p> Cosby was on the air for, what, eight years?  We&rsquo;ve had a bunch of other Black actors providing models of intelligent manly virtue for years, and it seems that only Whites are taken in.  As a public role model, BHO is no different that any other entertainer.  Yes, he&rsquo;s a real president, as real as George W. Bush, he doesn&rsquo;t just play one on TV, but to the image obsessed masses it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  He&rsquo;ll have all the effect on Black behavior as does Morgan Freeman, or as Bush has had on White behavior.  And when there is no change in Black pathology, what will the next fix be?</p>

			<p>I just can&rsquo;t stand more of this!! Why does the media continue to pretend that Whites only know of Blacks through television/media portrayals or allegedly unfair news reports?<br>
Most Americans, at this point in time, interact with Blacks on some basis, many with perhaps uncomfortable regularity and proximity! Most of us don&rsquo;t need TV to show us what Black behavior is like - we know that the Black stereotypes mentioned in the article are entirely based in fact. A white house filled to capacity with Blacks will not change that! </p>

			<p>Well, if Obama can create a better attitude in blacks and reduce dramatically fatherless homes, I&rsquo;d say his presidency, if succeeding in nothing else, was a good one.<br>
 <br>
But I&rsquo;ve learned and witnessed too much about blacks in general, and I know there&rsquo;s nothing under the sun that will alter their behavior one iota.<br>
 <br>
Their crime rate will not improve. So long as AA programs aren&rsquo;t increased there won&rsquo;t be any more blacks getting AA diplomas and degrees than there are now, and the anti-white attacks and disgusting hate will always be there until we rid them from our ranks by any means necessary.  And the constant whining about non-existent racism, prejudice and oppression will never be brought under control.<br>
 <br>
Sorry, but nothing has occurred which will allow this man to wave a wand over a pig and make it a beauty contestant.<br>

			<p>The MSM is going to make sure that Obama can&rsquo;t fail.  Or least, that&rsquo;s what they will try to feed us.  Everything he does will be seen as a plus for the country.  Closing Gitmo, lifting the ban on partial birth abortion, making nicey nice with the Middle East and their terrorists.  The MSM will make sure that we get a good healthy dose of the savior Obama everyday for the next 4 years or 8, if he&rsquo;s re-elected.  And anything journalist that dares to say even one disparging word about Obama is going to be labeled a racist.  Even if we are attacked (which I believe is going to happen), it won&rsquo;t be Obama&rsquo;s fault.  It will be because of George Bush and his &#8220;if you aren&rsquo;t with us you&rsquo;re against us policy.&#8221;  People can hate George Bush all they want.  I think he did serious damage to the Republican Party and the conservative movement and probably his 8 years in office helped put Obama in office.  But you gotta give the man credit.  Something he was doing, kept us from being attacked for the last 7 years and for that I am grateful.  </p>

			<p>Just like on 9/11 and the days that followed, nobody was thinking about being black, white, red or yellow.  For the first time, on that awful day and afterwards, we really were a united country.  But the politicians are having any of that.  They have to keep us divided.  Keeps us from noticing too much of what they are doing.  </p>
<p>Anybody heard about this movement to hold a new Constitutional Convention.  Supposedly 32 states have already approved it.  40 are needed and Virginia is voting on it soon.  First I heard about it just the other day. So if 32 states have already approved it, that means it&rsquo;s been in the works for some time.  If a new Constitutional Convention is held, it means a move towards abolishing our current Constitution and moving us towards that North American Union.  Obama is a left-wing globalist.  There&rsquo;s no doubt that he thinks our Constitution is old and outdated and should be changed or replaced.  This is something to watch out for.</p>

			<p>I think one of the good things to come out of this administration is that we now have a real role model for young black Americans, and a decent alternative to the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; culture that&rsquo;s pushed by the media.  It says that if you&rsquo;re monogamous, focus on education, and work hard, you can accomplish something.  I don&rsquo;t see why you guys think that&rsquo;s so horrible.  The Obamas are more like the Cosbys than the Jacksons or Sharptons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Obama&rsquo;s going to be any worse than Bush or Clinton towards whites.  He might as well provide spiritual fuel for blacks to actually try to accomplish something.  Maybe it&rsquo;s futile for black Americans to have role models like this, if you determinists are correct.  But then again, I suppose it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>At least we can all agree it will be amusing to watch so-called anti-racist professionals and sensitivity trainers like Tim Wise struggle to rationalize the existence of their jobs in the next four-to-eight years. :-)</p>

			<p>   I think it was Anonymous who said in an earlier post that if role models such as Bill Cosby, W.E.Dubois, Louis Armstrong, Booker T. Washington, Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson, Michael Jordon etc. couldn&rsquo;t act as positive role models to today&rsquo;s troubled black youth than it appears unlikely that a President Obama will be able to. </p>

			<p>If Obama and his family are to become role models for Blacks&hellip; can we expect a sharp DECREASE in the amount of rapes, robberies, muggings, hold-ups, drug deals, even murders usually committed by Blacks? I can hardly wait to see the precipitous drop as Blacks suddenly do a 180-degree about-face!</p>

			<p>Okay first of all someone to say that blacks need to mix with other ethnic groups to produce a good child is down write stupid. At my old high school and my current college there were many blacks who came from Haiti, Jamaica, and Nigeria who were very intelligent and went on to college to pursue a career (not in drug dealing). The United States has 21,000 Nigerian doctors alone practing medicine because those extremely intelligent whites are not becoming doctors. Nurses are coming in from S.E. Asia, Carribean countries, Latin America etc, because there is a great shortage of them. So don&rsquo;t spewing your racial superior rheotric.</p>
<p>Secondly, Obama has more than once admonished the foolishness that goes on in the black community and others as well. He will set a good example for blacks and others around the world.</p>
<p>Finally, a vast majority of blacks know that white people are not holding them back. Only few don&rsquo;t and get on their soap boxes and make themselves look foolish. They know because they have experienced Crips, Bloods, Vicelords, Black Gangster Disciples, and others first hand. Also black cops and teachers can be bad at times to.</p>
<p>Grow up guys.</p>

There will be many places on the planet where only a few people even know of these two airbags. And in the US, they are probably more famous in their minds and with blacks than with the general population! Well over 50% of Americans couldn&rsquo;t care less about either one of them! You sound like a product of the drive by media, the un-education system and the pc crowd.</p>

<p>  Actually, the only doctor shortage is created by the AMA, which limits the number of doctors, particularly white doctors who don&rsquo;t qualify for affirmative action.  Hospitals like hiring foreign doctors and nurses because they are willing to work for less money in big city urban hospitals. So many African doctors (Africa&rsquo;s elites) have left for Europe and America that there are serious doctor shortages in the African continent.   </p>

			<p>Sigh. European Americans now get the opportunity to watch Blacks sort out their &#8220;issues&#8221; and even get to praise Blacks who are supposedly good role models for other Blacks. In fact, for many Blacks, the mere overcoming of their psychological and social problems and maladaptive behaviors (to become even a semi-functional member of society) is considered akin to attaining Nirvana or ascending to heaven. How boring. The spiritual striving, Faustian curiosity and sublime cosmic longings that characterize the Western soul are light years beyond the ken of the average Third Worlder, but they must now be abandoned in favor of a &#8220;wondrous&#8221; but insipid spectacle that in its essentials is worthy only of the Oprah show or an &#8220;After School Special&#8221;. </p>
<p>We are not only supposed to be deeply gratified by this development, but must continue at all costs to ignore our own interests and needs, and to defer to the violent and wayward children in our midst (now &#8220;reformed&#8221;), even as our own inner nature dies from a lack of nourishment and our slide to defeat and extinction accelerates. Our engineered demise and the betrayal of all past and future generations of our kind are non-issues, compared to the earth-shattering development of Black self-help and empowerment. </p>
<p>The Afrocentric value system being foisted upon us is a form of psychic parasitism.</p>

			<p>It would be foolish to follow Obama&rsquo;s lead, because he is imperfect. He is not God. <br>
We all have faults, and blacks have many, many, many of them, as you will soon see in the coming years.<br>
He may have good intentions, but I guarantee Obama will tick off the blacks on more than one occasion during his term.In fact, he will step on many toes. <br>
All I know is I want LESS govt., so get out of my way Obama.</p>

<p>When people worship Obama and expect me to join them I always say, </p>
<p>&#8220;They cast the right actor for the part.  Wife could be a little shorter, but she&rsquo;s got great legs and her complexion sets off the standard pastel and bright First Lady Colors.&#8221;  &#8220;They&rsquo;ll need to add a bratty kid brother pretty soon though to keep up viewer interest.  Maybe a cousin from the Ghetto ala Will Smith in Prince of Bel Air.&#8221;  &#8220;It&rsquo;s good the oldest girl is only 10.  In a few years they can add some teen-age romance and behavior problems to change the show a bit to hook viewers who are getting bored into the new parents vs teens story lines.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rational thinker, no one ever said that there aren&rsquo;t intelligent and capable blacks out there. There are, but that&rsquo;s beside the point. The focus here is on GROUP not INDIVIDUAL behavior. You can trot out your Nigerian doctors and Hispanic nurses all day long and it doesn&rsquo;t change anything about what we&rsquo;re saying. I lived in a majority black city for years and I know what they&rsquo;re like in the real world. If I never see another black as long as I live, it will be too soon. </p>

			<p>To &#8220;rational thinker&#8221;, allow me to point out BILL COSBY, as decent an American as you can ask for&hellip; tried to tell his people the unpalatable truth. And got soundly criticized and denounced.</p>
<p>Claiming Americans don&rsquo;t WANT to become doctors? Gimme a break! American citizens can&rsquo;t seem to qualify for those oh, so nice grants, stipends, tuition reductions and other breaks foreigners get handed to them. Saddled with humongous education loan repayments, just maybe THAT&rsquo;s what is holding Americans back. You might want to get your facts straight.</p>
<p>The same goes for nurses. You might also want to consider the malpractice end. People just LOVE to sue doctors and nurses for imagined omissions, errors and the like. Which also holds many back from those career choices. Also immigrants usually do earn correspondingly less than American citizens in the medical profession. Which helps fuel the clamor and hype about &#8220;shortages&#8221; in the medical profession. Hospitals are also &#8220;for profit ONLY&#8221; enterprises.</p>
<p>Your positive points about Nigerians might have a grain of truth to them&hellip; but also remember NIGERIANS are certainly the greatest con artists and inventors of an endless variety of scams and frauds perpetrated on all people. While those Nigerian immigrants who are professionals might be relatively honest, we seem to have no trouble finding lots of Nigerian (and other African) immigrants who are lifelong  criminals   &mdash;   just like so many American-born Blacks.</p>
<p>Seems to me (and probably many other AmRen readers), your &#8216;rational thinking&rsquo; lacks more than a little rationality. Nor is it gross racism on my part for the valid points I&rsquo;ve brought up. It does not take rocket scientist brains to read the news, here and on other websites, in newspapers and other sources to understand minorities, especially Blacks, lead the race respective to committing the most crimes, per percentage of the American population. Just as we can readily learn on this and other websites, the crime problem in Europe can be laid squarely on the many African immigrants European nations find themselves &#8220;blessed&#8221; (cursed, really) with.</p>

			<p>rational thinker, there are, I think, 800 million Blacks in Africa.  It is a statistical certainty that there are a couple million of them that are really smart, Obama&rsquo;s father, for instance.  That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that by and large, most of them are a drain on the non-Black societies they&rsquo;ve come to be living in.  Rational thinkers do not draw generalizations from what are obviously exceptional cases.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The United States has 21,000 Nigerian doctors alone practing medicine because those extremely intelligent whites are not becoming doctors. Nurses are coming in from S.E. Asia, Carribean countries, Latin America etc, because there is a great shortage of them</p>
<p>Sir, why are those Nigerian doctors practising medicine in the US, and not in Nigeria? Isn&rsquo;t the doctor shortage worse in Nigeria? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if those third-world professionals went back to their own countries, which have worse skills shortages than America?</p>

			<p>In other words, blacks are incapable of acting morally as individuals. They need leaders to provide an example or even possibly to force morality on them. Note that most black pundits see the answer to black crime as having more police, &#8220;guards&#8221; to insure a peaceful society. Most telling, don&rsquo;t you think? I live in a township that has a population of 50,000 plus people spread over at least 100 square miles. We have two police cars.</p>
<p>Blacks need at least one cop/guard on every block to keep the peace.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Barack Obama&rsquo;s ancestry is one-half white, and both he and Michele Obama are obviously a part of that &ldquo;talented ten percent&rdquo; described by W. E. B. Dubois, so not all those young blacks who admire them will be able to match their achievements. I hope they will accept the obvious, but will still strive to live good and decent lives, rejecting the negative stereotypes of what we&rsquo;ve come to expect in black behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s considered the talented tenth?  An affirmative action civil rights lawyer and a wife who held a cushy senicure job at a Chicago hospital as a diversity coordinator?  Neither one of them has ever owned a business or earned a dime that wasn&rsquo;t suckled from the taxpayer&rsquo;s teet. </p>
<p>When the adulation of Obama by black youths wears off and it&rsquo;s back to business as usual, can we try segregation then?  Liberals?   </p>

			<p>&#8220;The United States has 21,000 Nigerian doctors alone practing medicine because those extremely intelligent whites are not becoming doctors. Nurses are coming in from S.E. Asia, Carribean countries, Latin America etc, because there is a great shortage of them.&#8221; So don&rsquo;t spewing your racial superior rheotric.</p>
<p>There is one reason and only one reason the United States has so many African, Indian, Asian and other foreign non white medical professionals.</p>
<p>Medical, dentistry, nursing and medical tech schools grossly discriminate against whites in admission.  I work at a large university that has medical, dentistry and nursing schools.  Friends who work in the admissions office tell me of the contortions they go through to deny admission to the most highly qualified white male American applicants and give admission to lesser qualified non whites.</p>
<p>I have overheard professors at the medical and nursing school discussing how to fudge the grades of non white students, especially the female non whites.  Apparently professors are under quite a bit of pressure to not only pass, but give grades of A and B to non white students who are failing.</p>
<p>There is a reaon white males are no longer becoming physicians, nurses, computer programmers, engineers or IT workers.  It is called vicious discrimination against the most qualified because they are White American males.</p>
<p>I have a friend,  a Nigerian immigrant who is a nurse.  She got her degree in America while working as a nurse&rsquo;s aid.  She has told me of the total corruption in Nigeria, including the outright sale of medical, nursing and other degrees and transcripts by staff at Nigerian colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The reason Bola left Nigeria is because the professors at her university demanded that all the women students sleep with any professor who selected them.  She studied hard.  She is very intelligent.  She earned her A and B grades.  But she was expected to pay the professors bribes to have her true grades recorded. That&rsquo;s another reason she left Nigeria.  Then there were the extortion payments Nigerian officials demanded of her Mother who ran a successful business.</p>
<p>I once mentioned to her that the vice-President of Nigeria was speaking at my university.  Did she want to come? &#8220;Why do you think I left Nigeria? &#8220;To get away from the likes of him.&#8221; She replied.</p>
<p>One thing about Asian, African, Indian, Middle Eastern, Russian and Latin American immigration, Americans learn the truth about life in those corrupt he**holes.</p>
<p>The more my city and workplace is invaded by third world immigrants, the more I learn about their native countries.  I have discovered that even the most extreme White chauvinist eugenics theorists from the 1900&rsquo;s never knew the half of the horrors that go on in Africa, India, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>
<p>There are more Ethopian doctors in just the city of Chicago than there are in the whole of Ethopia.  Why don&rsquo;t African doctors stay in their own countries and take care of their own instead of relying on White medical missionaries to take care of Africans.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I think it was Anonymous who said in an earlier post that if role models such as Bill Cosby, W.E.Dubois, Louis Armstrong, Booker T. Washington, Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson, Michael Jordon etc. couldn&rsquo;t act as positive role models to today&rsquo;s troubled black youth than it appears unlikely that a President Obama will be able to.&#8221;</p>
<p>To go one step beyond that, now Blacks will demonstrate a boldness not ever seen before.  Especially when the economy goes into a depression, they&rsquo;re going to assert themselves as never before.  Take care folks and be careful.</p>

<p>And what good has three decades of silly black propaganda done, with respect to the aggregate behavior of blacks?</p>

<p>Nursing shortage?   </p>
<p>You insult and slam us Whites here and claim we have no &#8216;facts to back us up&rsquo; but then present no facts of your own. And, how is stating facts &#8216;racially superior rhetoric&rsquo; (did you notice I used the correct spelling of &#8216;rhetoric&rsquo;?)? </p>
<p>Your assertion of &#8216;a nursing shortage&rsquo; is laughable.</p>
<p>Here are a few facts you are free to dispute:</p>
<p>&#8221;..For over a year, we have been reading about a &#8216;shortage&rsquo;<br>
of nurses&hellip;.And to fill those jobs, hospitals turn to placement firms like Core Medical Group to find nurses abroad and bring them to the U.S.</p>
<p>There are over 600,000 American registered nurses not working as nurses, and countless other nurses who have become independent nurses. These are nurses&hellip; They are available&hellip; They are American&hellip; but hospitals won&rsquo;t hire them. Why? It&rsquo;s about the money. Hospitals refuse to pay nurses enough.</p>
<p>Core Medical Group&rsquo;s Armand Circharo [was in] South Africa where he was distributing brochures offering positions in &#8216;Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia&hellip;.wherever you want to go&rsquo; to eager would-be clients. </p>
<p>Hopkins offered: &#8216;Automatically, for families, we will be sponsoring you for your green cards because this then entitles husbands to come through with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>[The salary offered],$35,000, is considerably less than the going rate for U.S. nurses and barely an adequate income for families in urban centers&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/awall/spraying_blood.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;those extremely intelligent whites are not becoming doctors&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but not for the reasons you think. Government sponsored  anti-White AA and the exorbitant costs of medical school have prevented those &#8216;extremely intelligent Whites&rsquo; from enrolling.</p>
<p>Ed Rubenstein, President of ESR Research Economic Consultants, writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Jordan Cohen, the head of the Association of American Medical Colleges, is quoted as opining that &#8216;medical school admission committees have probably placed a heavier weight on an applicant&rsquo;s race than Justice Powell may have envisioned when he wrote the decisive opinion in the landmark Bakke case in 1978.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this, as to why foreign doctors are replacing American doctors:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It starts in medical school. We do little to help finance medical education in this country. By contrast, many foreign doctors are educated here, or in their home country, at heavily subsidized tuitions. </p>
<p>American medical schools are expensive.  The estimated total cost of four years attendance comes to approximately $140,000 for public schools and $225,000 for private schools. .</p>
<p>At the same time dwindling insurance reimbursements, higher malpractice premiums have reduced the income that U.S.-born doctors can reasonably expect over their working lifetime&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/rubenstein/070509_nd.htm</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to hear your reasons as to why those &#8216;extremely intelligent Whites&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t enrolling in medical school and your proof that there is a nursing shortage.</p>
<p>Remember: Back up everything you write with verifiable facts from reputable sources.  No one here is interested in the opinions and beliefs that you pass off as facts.</p>

<p>21,000 Nigerian doctors are 21,000 incompetents, and that is an absolute fact.  I would venture to say that every white in the US who flunked out of med school could pass his exams in Nigeria with flying colors at the top of his class.</p>
<p>Anybody that would elect to be tampered with by a black African, claiming to be a doctor, is an absolute fool of the highest order.</p>
<p>And, contrary to what has been claimed on here before, Nigerians are not given rigorous tests before they&rsquo;re allowed to practice in this country.  They are tested via a cursory AA process just in order to get them in and that is absolutely no exaggeration.  And to assure passing even more, US test questions and answers are passed between them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Did anybody really expect them to be qualified?</p>

<p>Good point, Fed Up.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever see this gentleman ever rebut anything with facts, reason or logic, because he has succumbed to the leftist propaganda supporting the messiah, which is totally devoid of substance and amounts to nothing more than sound bytes. Sound bytes in; sound bytes out.</p>
<p>A constant repetition of untruths eventually makes them believable to the uninformed and gullible.  It&rsquo;s a lot like the propaganda fed to cult and sect members, and no one makes more avid true believers that they do.</p>
