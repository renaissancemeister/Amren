	<p>Reporting from Castel Volturno, Italy &mdash; {snip}</p>
<p>The killings in September, recounted in interviews by senior antimafia officials, were gory evidence of conflict between the Neapolitan mafia, known as the Camorra, and Nigerian gangsters who play a growing role in Italy&rsquo;s drug and prostitution rackets.</p>
<p>This landscape of change and fear has been shaped by a singular juxtaposition: One of Europe&rsquo;s biggest concentrations of African immigrants has risen in the heart of Camorra turf.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the victims were illegal immigrant laborers, though one or two may have been low-level drug pushers, investigators say. The fusillade of 130 bullets was apparently an indiscriminate message from a Camorra clan aimed at terrifying its junior partners into obedience.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not about racism at all,&#8221; said Jean-Rene Bilongo, a community mediator from Cameroon who speaks French, English and Italian with the broad Neapolitan accent. &#8220;It was about business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nigerian gangsters have made Castel Volturno a European headquarters. In the 1990s, demand boomed here for African prostitutes &mdash; prosecutors call it &#8220;the Naomi Campbell phenomenon.&#8221; Camorra clans &#8220;rented&#8221; turf to Nigerian pimps, a line of work that Neapolitan gangsters disdain.</p>
<p>And as cocaine flows increasingly to Europe through West Africa, Nigerians have graduated from their previous role as smuggling &#8220;mules&#8221; and pay the Camorra for a cut of street trafficking action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Castel Volturno and elsewhere in southern Europe where crime, immigration and economic crisis converge, an uncertain future is under construction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to deal with the social problems, and not just using the police,&#8221; said Mayor Francesco Nuzzo, who estimates there are 15,000 undocumented immigrants here. &#8220;This is a world. There are 50 different ethnicities in Castel Volturno.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Africans first came to work in tomato fields made bountiful by the climate of the Caserta region and subsidies from the European Union. In recent years, many arrived on a new flow of ragged smuggling flotillas from Libya to Sicily.</p>
<p>Like the fugitive local gangsters who dodge police for years in the mob-dominated towns north of Naples, newcomers find this a good place to lie low.</p>
<p>&#8220;It attracts illegal immigrants because there is a generalized culture of lawlessness,&#8221; the senior antimafia official said. &#8220;People don&rsquo;t pay taxes, they build illegally, they dump garbage illegally, they buy contraband, they work off the books. People in this part of Italy have a problem with rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>But jobs are scarce. Employers prefer Eastern Europeans to work in hotels and South Asians to clean up after the herds of buffalo whose milk is used to produce the region&rsquo;s acclaimed mozzarella.</p>

		<p>There was a story in AR yesterday about the EUSSR wanting 50 million more such people.  Do they think that more of the same will yield a different result?  It doesn&rsquo;t take an Einstein to realize that it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

		<p>Southern Italy was already more like Africa than any other part of Western Europe.  Northern Italians call Southern Italians &#8220;Africans&#8221; and the racial conscious Northern Italians want their own country so they can be free of these people.  </p>

		<p>The previous communist dominated Italian government (but definitely NOT the italian people) was soft-headed and indulgent to the mass waves of blacks landing in their shores demanding to stay in Italy.<br/>
 Now they can reap their reward and not just reap tomatoes.</p>

		<p> Certainly, one can see the rise of the Northern League and other anti-immigration Italian parties in response to the &#8220;diversity&#8221; brought about by Nigerian immigration mentioned in the article.  </p>

		<p>Southern Italians are NOT &#8220;Africans&#8221;   &mdash;  - please don&rsquo;t say so.</p>
<p>That statement suggests that S. Italians are incompatible with civilization in the same way the Africans are. As a (non-Southern) Italian I will say this is very false and misleading.</p>
<p>Ask anybody who lives in a Northern Italy city: how is the behavior of the Southern Italians who came to live in your Northern city? Everybody will say that they are nice law-abiding citizens. You will also find many S. Italians who have reached positions of high responsibility in the North, even though they haven&rsquo;t benefited from any kind of affermative action.</p>
<p>But if you ask about the actual Africans who migrated to Northern (or Southern) Italy, everybody will say that they misbehave and cause big trouble. There&rsquo;s no comparison - Southern Italians behave in a civilized manner, Africans do not.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t deny that Italians (and Neapolitans especially) have an excitable and &#8220;testosteronic&#8221; temperament. Many White nations have such an excitable character, such as the Irish. And while it&rsquo;s true that many places in Southern Italy are corrupt and crime-ridden, so are many places in the former Soviet Union. However, nobody would say that Irishmen or Russians are &#8220;Africans&#8221;.</p>
<p>True, Southern Italy and especially Naples is a mess. If you want to know why it is such a mess, the answer is very similar to why Russia is a mess.</p>
<p>Southern Italy (or rather, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies) was a prosperous and well-ordered country in the 19th century. It was even a respected minor power with some political weight. There was no Mafia or other organized crime back then.</p>
<p>The problem started around 1860, when Northern Italy (or rather a coalition of Northern Italian generals, gullible Southern revolutionaries, and the British Royal Navy) conquered the South and dismantled its centuries old aristocratic system of government, thus creating Italy, and the Southern mess with her.</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;m in danger of sounding like one those people who blame the problem of Africa on colonialism. But in this case, it&rsquo;s entirely appropriate. The problem is that the Northerners imposed liberalism over an aristocratic country. It&rsquo;s only natural that if you take away the aristocracy from a people that was used to aristocracy, and fail to replace it, trouble will follow. Some people need someone to be loyal to.</p>
<p>The North dismantled the existing system, but wasn&rsquo;t able to replace it. Years of guerrilla war followed. During that time period the Mafia and other criminal organizations developed like a cancer with the intention to fill in the void. These illegal institutions see themselves as legitimate and are very difficult to dismantle, especially with the limited power of a liberal constitutional state.<br/>

		<p>Having traveled through Italy just a few months ago, I can attest that the presence of Africans in the Naples area is miniscule compared to the number in the northern cities.  Milan and Turin are filled with a rabble of the very worst of the third world   &mdash;   unwashed Africans sprawled on park benches, gypsies sorting through trash bins, and surly, frown-faced Muslims everywhere.  In Naples, the only non-whites spotted were two bewildered-looking Africans at the train station hurriedly booking tickets for Milan.  </p>
<p>If there is a Nigerian presence in the south, it&rsquo;s relatively small in proportion to the total population   &mdash;   which is understandable that if one has taken the effort to get to Western Europe from Africa, it makes little sense to settle in the very poorest part of it.</p>

<p>True enough.  The overwhelming majority of the Italians who immigrated to this country were Southern Italians/Sicilians?  Guess what?  They assimilated beautifully!  As a rule they obey the laws, pay their taxes, get educated and the majority of them vote Republican.  For proof of how well they assimilated read Dr. Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s book &#8220;Ethnic America.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I know a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Irish woman who told me she&rsquo;d sooner walk through Howard Beach or Bensonhurst (two predominantly Southern Italian/Sicilian neighborhoods here in Zoo York) in a bikini before walking through Harlem or East New York fully clothed.  I don&rsquo;t have to state the reason why.</p>
<p>For centuries the English occupied Ireland.  The destitute state of the Irish that resulted from this was construed by many Englishmen as somehow being &#8220;proof&#8221; of Irish inferiority.  Then in the 1990s everyone was ooohing and aaaahing about &#8220;the Celtic tiger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it people: genetics plays a key role in shaping who we are as individuals and as peoples, but environment plays an important part, too.</p>
