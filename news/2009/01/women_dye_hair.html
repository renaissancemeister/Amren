<h1>Women Dye Hair Blonde Amid Recession</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton revealed a 67 per cent surge in the sales of his blonde hair products compared to this time last year.</p>
<p>And after quizzing his customers, Barton said the &#8220;gold rush&#8221; showed a simple change of colour was providing women with the perfect antidote to the gloom of the credit crunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe it is purely a coincidence that there&rsquo;s been a huge sales rise in blonde hair products during these tough financial times,&#8221; said Barton, resident hair expert on C4&rsquo;s Ten Years Younger and British Hairdresser of the Year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of my female clients say they feel more confident, more youthful and more attractive when they go blonde and they get more attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;With only 10 per cent of UK women having naturally blonde hair, choosing to be blonde must be more than about how you look.&#8221;</p>
<p>A survey of 1,200 customers in Asda, where Barton&rsquo;s Shiny Happy Hair range is sold, found the perception that blondes were &#8216;extrovert&rsquo; and &#8216;more sexy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 90 per cent of male respondents said they believe blondes have more fun.</p>
<p>Barton highlighted the influence of blonde icons over the years, from Marlene Dietrich and Marilyn Monroe through to Debbie Harry and Madonna.</p>
<p>The current most influential blonde bombshell, he said, is Paris Hilton, the millionaire heiress who arrived in the UK this week to promote her new reality TV show Paris Hilton&rsquo;s British Best Friend.</p>
<p>The top 10 most popular blonde stereotypes revealed in the survey:</p>
<p>1. Extrovert</p>
<p>2. More sexy</p>
<p>3. Childlike ignorance</p>
<p>4. Make better girlfriends</p>
<p>5. Will kiss on a first date</p>
<p>6. More fun on a night out</p>
<p>7. More popular</p>
<p>8. Spontaneous</p>
<p>9. More wealthy</p>
<p>10. Dumb<br>

			<p>In my opinion, the 52 year old American actress, Sela Ward, who is NOT blond, is far more beautiful than the far younger Paris Hilton. I don&rsquo;t mean to be unkind, but blond or not, I just don&rsquo;t see what it is about Paris Hilton.</p>

			<p>They ought to pay attention to the story here in AR several days ago, about those blond girls being expelled from school.</p>

<p>Without a doubt Sela Ward is much more beautiful than Paris Hilton. Although Paris not only colors her dark hair blond, but wears blue contacts over her naturally dark eyes. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what color her hair. Not only do I think she has the face of an anteater. But her rich, pampered, spoiled party girl image makes her doubly unattractive. Either way, it is very easy to name some brunettes who are more beautiful than blonds, and visa versa. As was already pointed out here Charlize Theron is far more beautiful Amy Winehouse. The most beautiful hair in the world makes little difference, if it frames an unattractive face.</p>

			<p>I well remember when affirmative action first hit the TV news showns 1968 to about 1974. At first, nearly all the females were black, a double affirmative action hire which satisfied the EEOC gestapo.</p>
<p>But then, it turned out that the men liked watching the few blonde women newscasters rather than the black females forced on the programs by the EEOC gestapo.  By 1980, even the ultra racist PC anti white news programs featured good looking blonde white women instead of the blacks.</p>
<p>Blondes rule and there is absolutely nothing the anti white racists can do about it.</p>

			<p>One thing we Americans and other users of Standard English should do is to remember the &#8216;-e&rsquo; gender marker which still appears in a certain handful of English words. &#8216;Blond&rsquo; means a man and &#8216;blonde&rsquo; means a woman. So, &#8220;I saw a blond&rsquo; carries with it the message that I am talking about a man or a boy.</p>
<p>&#8216;Blonde&rsquo; is used correctly in this article since the author is discussing women.</p>
<p>For me, the most beautiful blonde actress in recent memory was Andrea Thompson; (imho) she was at her peak in &#8216;Babylon 5&rsquo; in the mid-90s. Then she had a baby with one of the other actors and things went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Straight hair and ice blue or grey eyes are also recessive genetic traits; easy to get stomped under in interracial breeding.</p>
<p>One other thing about blond* people: I remember a study that showed that when people look at a light-skinned, dark haired person, their eyes begin at the top of the forehead where dark hair and light skin meet. However, for blonds, the eye starts at the top of the hair (with the background serving as the visual contrast) so that the eye subconsciously reacts as if the person were taller.</p>
<p>(*in the plural, you use the masculine gender unless the entire population under discussion is known to be female.)</p>

<p>Total agreement on this.</p>

			<p>I am writing this from Medellin Colombia and see thousands of young (and older) Colombiam women of whom 99% have natural black hair who either lighten their hair or become blondes altogether. It seems to me that they want to look like us. I also watch the news and soap operas here. It is amazing that the newswomen and other show presenters look completely white in a land where few look white. They dont have to do this as they are naturally beautiful with thier long black hair, think Julie Banderas on Fox News, she is part Colombian and georgous. But,, there must be a universal untold knowledge that the white race is superior in looks and brains.  KF</p>

			<p>In debates about genetic engineering, people always talk about the fear (or hope) of whole generations of &#8216;blue-eyed, blond-haired children&rsquo;. <br>
But how can this be the paradigm? After all, I thought we were told years ago that &#8216;Black is Beautiful&rsquo;. </p>

<p>Apparently a lot of black guys don&rsquo;t think black is beautiful, since they&rsquo;re going after white women.  Preferably blue-eyed blondes.</p>

<p>&gt; Blonde females rule, you mean.  Blonde men are all but spit upon these days.  Brad Pitt not-with-standing, there were many, many more blonde male actors and entertainers 20 years ago than today - and falling.  Blonde men get trashed daily to the point that blonde women feel they are stepping way down to date/marry one.  I have little doubt that we are seeing the last White James Bond, but especially the last blonde one.</p>

<p>Granted he is an athlete not an actor, but from this white woman&rsquo;s point of view, I would much rather see a gorgeous blonde British man like David Beckham play James Bond <br>

Over a black American record producer/hiphop singer like P Diddy, who has expressed an interest to play him.</p>
