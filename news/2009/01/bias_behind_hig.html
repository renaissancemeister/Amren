<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gay and bisexual black men in America are the most likely people in the world to contract HIV, and community advocates say current efforts to stem the epidemic aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gay black men are more likely to contract HIV than any other population in the country,&#8221; said Caudie Grissom, a counselor with Atlantabased National AIDS Education &amp; Services for Minorities. &#8220;Even with all of our modern technology and medication, American black gay men are more likely to have HIV than people living in third world countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>NAESM sponsored the fifth annual National African-American MSM Leadership Conference on HIV/AIDS. Held Jan. 22-25 in Atlanta, it attracted hundreds of community organizers and activists from across the country. Asked why the rates of HIV and AIDS are higher among black men who have sex with men, answers ranged from poor federal services to stigma and discrimination within a mostly white medical profession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Ernest] Hopkins is a vice-chair of the National Black Gay Men&rsquo;s Advocacy Coalition, an organization that lobbies in Washington on gay health issues. Hopkins said major obstacles to lowering HIV rates among black men who have sex with men include a lack of research on HIV in the black community; prevention and health care models based on the idea that gay men live openly in communities like Midtown; and a shortage of doctors who are well-versed and comfortable treating black gay men, HIV positive or not.</p>
<p>In 2005, a five-city study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention showed that of the gay and bisexual men who were surveyed, 46 percent of black men were HIV-positive. This meant black men who have sex with men were nearly twice as likely to be infected with HIV than other gay and bisexual men.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is really nothing out there for the black gay community, and that&rsquo;s really an indictment on the CDC, on HRSA [Health Resources &amp; Services Administration], on every level of HHS [Health &amp; Human Services] and the other structures that are providing programs,&#8221; Hopkins said. &#8220;We just have not been prioritized. That&rsquo;s due to homophobia and racism, just very clearly that&rsquo;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Different community</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gay identity is a larger question within the black community than in others, said participants at the conference. NAESM chose to use the term MSM, which stands for men who have sex with men, because it wants to reach black men who have homosexual sex but do not consider themselves gay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hopkins called on successful African Americans to leave their high-level jobs to start nonprofits because there aren&rsquo;t enough agencies out there to stem the infection rate in the black community.</p>
<p><b>Discriminating doctors?</b></p>
<p>&#8220;There was a study last year in New York City that talked about black gays were less likely to come out to their doctors than white gays, and therefore less likely to be tested for HIV,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;What that study didn&rsquo;t talk about is that there were very few black gay doctors for people to go to. Most of the white gay men in the study were going to white gay doctors.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black men feel what Malebranche [David Malebranche, a physician and researcher at Emory University&rsquo;s School of Medicine] called &#8220;racial stress,&#8221; sexual prejudice, gender role expectations and difficulties in the medical culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Malebranche said that black men, especially on the lower end of the income scale, have difficulty finding doctors they feel comfortable with who understand the unique health risks that gay men face.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another factor could be a disproportionate amount of depression among black men. Dr. Linda Smith of NAESM said that 70 percent of black gay men develop some level of depression during their lives and most will not seek treatment.</p>

			<p>Not one word about individual accountability.  Not one word about people solving their own problems.  </p>
<p>But lots of words amounting to a parade of absurdities.  The best has to be about calling upon successful blacks to leave their high-level jobs to start nonprofits, because there are not enough agencies&hellip;  Excuse me, but if Black gays are savvy enough to clutter up all the internet dating sites with their inane ads, then they are savvy enough to access a little information on AIDS and how it is transmitted.</p>
<p>&#8216;Agencies&rsquo; and &#8216;programs&rsquo; cannot solve all the problems in the world.  </p>

			<p>I once thought that black MSM was rare outside of prisons, based on the notion that too many black men thought of themselves as too macho to do such a thing.   </p>
<p>However, my opinion started changing in 2001, when the St. Louis City health department started putting provocative billboards in black neighborhoods in the city.  One showed two suggestively naked black men embracing each other, with the message that one should get tested for HIV.  Another showed a black woman, with the caption, &#8220;My boyfriend just got out of jail.  Should I get tested?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, the naked billboard caused such a controversy that all these billboards were changed.  They only lasted a month or so.</p>
<p>That, and other things, now make me think that black MSM is more common than I first thought.  However, I think this article has it right, in that black MSM behavior isn&rsquo;t the same as white homosexuality, in that the latter is (IMHO) a lifestyle choice, while the former has to do with them wanting to &#8220;relate&#8221; with any convenient orifice.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What that study didn&rsquo;t talk about is that there were very few black gay doctors for people to go to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know it isn&rsquo;t funny, but that line alomst made me spew my pop. I would go to any doctor who was a good doctor, as I&rsquo;m expected to as a white man. Why can&rsquo;t we hold the same expectations for non-whites. Does a doctor really need to understand &#8220;being a sick black man&#8221; in order to treat one?  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always whitey&rsquo;s fault isn&rsquo;t it? Has the black community EVER stepped up to the plate and taken responsibility for their own actions? EVER?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There is really nothing out there for the black gay community, and that&rsquo;s really an indictment on the CDC, on HRSA [Health Resources &amp; Services Administration], on every level of HHS [Health &amp; Human Services] and the other structures that are providing programs,&rdquo; Hopkins said. &ldquo;We just have not been prioritized.

<p>Yep, there we go. It&rsquo;s racism! Here&rsquo;s a tip for all the responsible black men out there. In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, the Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has developed a cure for AIDS. I&rsquo;m sure his JuJu is far more potent than the white man&rsquo;s racist JuJu. Please take all of your STDs and HIV problems to him and stop blaming us for all of your problems.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the url for the cure if you care to seek out this African &#8220;miracle worker&#8221;.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Asked why the rates of HIV and AIDS are higher among black men who have sex with men, answers ranged from poor federal services to stigma and discrimination within a mostly white medical profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is actually quite simple. If you don&rsquo;t engage in homosexual sexual activities you will NOT become HIV +.  Gay blacks and gay white men have high rates of HIV because of their irresponsible actions not because of a &#8220;mostly white medical profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;major obstacles to lowering HIV rates among black men who have sex with men include a lack of research on HIV in the black community..&#8221;</p>
<p>Major obstacles are black men who take no personal responsibility for the actions nor understand that their action have both negative and positive consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;black men who have homosexual sex but do not consider themselves gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Men who have homosexual relations with other men have gay sex. What is there not to consider. That is gay sex. By any other name it is still dangerous gay sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there aren&rsquo;t enough agencies out there to stem the infection rate in the black community.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there will never be enough because black men do not understand the concept of personal responsibility. So these agencies will want more government money (from American tax-payers) and donations. </p>
<p>It seems like these doctors and researchers are finding tons of justifications for these black homosexuals (who are in denial) to avoid accepting the fact that these black men have sex with men and because they are &#8220;not gay&#8221; they don&rsquo;t believe that their actions will give them a long slow painful death.</p>

<p><br>
If black gays have such a &#8220;community&#8221;, then they should be able to <i>start their own</i> organizations instead of waiting for the Feds to do it for them.  How do they think all the white gay groups got started?  </p>
<p>No matter where they go in the world, Africans are always waiting around for outsiders to do something for them.  </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that they do just that: successful black men decide they would rather serve their local community.  As upper management becomes whiter, the company is accused of institutional racism, vilified by Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, etc.</p>

			<p>I read several months ago in the &#8221; discover&#8221; magazine about a scientist who says AIDS/HIV is a wrong diagnosis.  You can find his videos online, search for AIDS hoax or HIV cause of AIDS? etc</p>
<p>kind of interesting&hellip;&hellip;. It might be more about money and group selection than people want to think. some northern Euro&rsquo;s cant even contract HIV, but most Africans are prone to it. It is interesting to watch.</p>

			<p>The higher rates of AIDs among african-american men has nothing whatsoever to do with whites, the &#8220;white medical establishment&#8221;, white doctors, lack of funding or lack of AIDS awareness. AIDS prevention has been put in front of the public for years, anyone should know how to prevent AIDS unless they are living in a cave.<br>
There is only one thing and one thing alone that is responsible for the rise in AIDS among black men and that is their BEHAVIOR!<br>
If black men would stop engaging in promiscuous sex especially promiscuous gay sex and especially unprotected sex and would stop sharing needles with other drug users, their rates of AIDS would be very very low. Until black men stop engaging in high risk behavior, nothing will change.</p>

			<p>So blacks blame their high AIDS infection rates on the fact that the gov&rsquo;t is not spending enough of our tax $ to educate blacks on how the disease is spread.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so laughable about all this is that there&rsquo;s not a single American who doesn&rsquo;t know that unprotected gay sex is risky. Blacks know this but do it anyway because they&rsquo;re irresponsible and immature. </p>

			<p>Gosh, what a surprise!  A group known for a serious self-control deficit, low intelligence, an extreme propensity for criminal behavior, and little appreciation for the consequences of their actions has a higher incidence of STD than any other group, even Africans thankfully still living in Africa?</p>
<p>This is a stunning revelation and just more telling indictment of the white racists who continually plot to destroy the lives of American blacks.</p>

			<p>I tried to argue, saying AIDS is just a medical condition, a disease, but apparently AIDS is different.</p>
<p>600,000 Americans have actually died of AIDS. Why do we never, ever, learn the race of those who&rsquo;ve died from it?</p>
<p>Those darn Televangelists&hellip; They&rsquo;re right again. AIDS must be different from every other disease. </p>

<p>Are you serious! Have seen some of the stuff thats done in frat parties, rock concerts, or regular public schools. Those are border line orgies. For most part whites are very promiscuous. You are off your rocker if you think whites are not being sexually active at a high number. What do they go to rock concerts, night clubs, dance clubs, and such acting very mature and adult like? The reason they are having so few kids is because they have birth control and are more likely to uses condoms. That&rsquo;s the only reason why whites have low teen preganacy and STD rate. The only difference is that they are not affected the same way. <br>

			<p>In addition to HIV, the rate of other STDs in the Black community is staggering. I have read statistics that say the syphillis etc rates are very high. This is men, hetro or homosexual, and women. </p>

<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right that there are plenty of whites that are sexually promiscuous. However, on average whites are not as promiscuous as blacks and when whites are sexually promiscuous, they are far more likely to use condoms or birth control. If this weren&rsquo;t true, then black HIV rates wouldnt&rsquo; be much higher as AIDS doesn&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>

<p>Do you honestly believe anything you post?  I was in a fraternity in college (only about 3 years ago) and I never saw anything like you are describing.  Whites simply do not engage in sexual activity at anywhere near the level that blacks do.  And if blacks are really only experiencing these high levels of STD&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t use condoms then whose fault is that?  Condoms are readily available and cheap.  I&rsquo;m sorry but anyone who is dumb enough to have sex with a total stranger these days and not wear a condom deserves whatever they get.  </p>

			<p>Wait a minute - I thought AIDS was the disease that doesn&rsquo;t discriminate?  Its funny, if anyone would have pointed out that AIDs was largely a black disease early on in the crises, they would have been decried as racist.  How dare they stigmatize black men like that.  Now that AIDS has reached levels in some black inner-cities that rival African countries, all of a sudden its racism at the heart of the problem.  </p>

<p>Many white youth are promiscuous, but black youth are EVEN MORE PROMISCUOUS on average than white youth.  Whites (currently) make up the majority of Americans, so you have to look at the difference per capita and consider that blacks make up 12 - 15% of the U.S. population.  Most of the social dysfunction in our country at this time is coming from their tribe, with Mestizos in second place.</p>
<p>Blacks, both male and female, have higher testosterone levels on average than whites, and this causes them to have higher sex drives, build muscle easily, and be more confrontational and violent than whites.  This is not just my opinion.  Check out the scientific research by non-PC, totally objective scientists like Dr. Philippe Rushton who risk their careers to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Rational thinker is not totally wrong. I have friend who is a medical doctor. He told me that since the mid 1990s, he has seen a dramatic increase in the number of White men who contact sexually transmitted diseases. He said that he could just survive alone on just treating these men. Most of them are between 25 -45 years old.</p>
<p>The fact is that many young White men are very promiscuous. A number of other posters on this board have concurred as such.  </p>

			<p>What do you think people?<br>
Here&rsquo;s a hint on how to avoid AIDS&hellip;<br>
1) Try to reduce your random sexual shennanigans (hows about finding someone nice and staying on a one-on-one basis as normal people do) and,<br>
2) Stop sticking needles loaded with drugs in your arm. Nancy Reagan and Punky Brewster were right, &#8220;Just say no!&#8221; OK dude, it might be &#8216;square&rsquo;, but growing up is better that getting a terminal disease eh? </p>

			<p>I would love to know how high rates of HIV/AIDS are caused by &#8220;discrimination within a mostly white medical profession&#8221;?<br>
There is no cure for it, so the medical profession doesn&rsquo;t affect rates of HIV in any way.  The article is about the number of people who have contracted this disease, not management of it.<br>
There&rsquo;s not a cure, and evil white doctors aren&rsquo;t making anybody go out and have gay sex.  They can&rsquo;t do anything to stop people from contracting it, and they aren&rsquo;t neglecting to offer a cure.</p>
<p>Just behave in a sexually responsible manner and use condoms- it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

			<p>&#8220;rational thinker responce at 7:36&#8221;- I read the three articles you posted and it seems to me that STD&rsquo;s seemed to skyrocket in Britain at the same time that the Africans started arriving there. I also wonder how many of these &#8220;British&#8221; counted in these studies are acually African! They also state that there&rsquo;s more promiscuity in Britain than anywhere in the WORLD!! Now does anyone really believe that? More than in Africa? More than in Mexico? REALLY!!!!! And as far as Whites &#8220;chasing your black friends&#8221;, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that it&rsquo;s too bad they&rsquo;re not chasing them for the RIGHT reasons. Back in the day when blacks were REALLY chased, we[Whites] never had to worry about our safety as we do now. </p>

			<p>I remember a huge scandal here in New Jersey about 10 years ago. There were several White males (some were police officers)in their mid 20 to mid 30s who were involved in a pact to see how many Black women they could have sex with in a six month period. </p>
<p>Some of these men were married and a number of these women were under 18. A few of these girls were as young as 14 years old! </p>
<p>They way that some of these men took advantage of these women was disgusting! The graphic testimony that was released to the public was sickening. Two of the men received prison time. Several others received long probation sentences.</p>
<p>My point is that no one should be under the illusion that it is only Black, Latino or non-White men who are running around having wanton sex. There are plenty of White men doing the same thing. <br>

			<p>As a white gay man, I follow three rules to ensure my physical wellbeing and health:</p>
<p>1) Always engage in safe sexual practices with partners in a secure relationship.</p>
<p>2) Never have sex with non-White men.</p>
<p>3) Always avoid blacks and hispanics in any situation where they could bash me (it is a well known yet unspoken fact within the gay community that the majority of gay-bashers are blacks and hispanics).</p>

			<p>I am a Hispanic woman who lives in Boston. I can attest to the fact that many White males are oversexed beyond belief. </p>
<p>I have taken going to bars with other male friends instead of going alone. The reason for doing this is that when I went out by myself or with girlfriends, I could not go for ten minutes without some horny White guy hitting on me wanting to have sex with me. There were guys of other races who did the same thing but young White men were the worse. </p>
<p>Yes, I know that many White men have problems controlling their libidos.</p>
