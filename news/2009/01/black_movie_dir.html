<h1><a href="https://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2009/20090119124854.aspx">Spike Lee: Hand of God Caused Economic Crisis to Get Obama Elected</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Poor, Business &amp; Media Institute, January 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Controversial filmmaker Spike Lee revealed he thought the economic difficulties that are presently plaguing the country were ordained by God to help get Barack Obama elected president. Lee appeared on MSNBC&rsquo;s Jan. 10 &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; and, in an interview with co-host Joe Scarborough, he made the revelation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;So many things have happened  &mdash;  all of a sudden, the economy goes south at that moment, and then McCain,&#8221; Lee replied. &#8220;There were so many things. It was almost a movement that had to be ordained, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not it was a product of divine intervention, political insiders do believe the market collapse last fall had a huge impact on McCain&rsquo;s bid for the presidency, as Dan Schnur, national communications director for John McCain&rsquo;s 2000 presidential bid pointed out in the Nov. 3, 2008 Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The turning point in this election didn&rsquo;t happen on the campaign trail but rather on Wall Street,&#8221; Schnur wrote. &#8220;In the last week of September, the race was essentially tied. Then Wall Street collapsed  &mdash;  and it collapsed right on top of John McCain.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The hand of bonehead George Bush got Barack Obama elected, not God. He is the one who caused the economic collapse.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Black moviemaker shows he doesn&rsquo;t understand economics either.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.  The little racist dwarf is a dumbell by anybody&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>On Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show O&rsquo;Reilly commented that the percentage of blacks incarcerated per their share of the population was far greater than any other group, to which Lee replied, &#8220;Well, that&rsquo;s cause whites got enuff money to get out on bail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I read where he was one of the malcontents funded by Soros, just as he funded Moveon.org, which is probably correct because there&rsquo;s no way someone with his obvious lack of intelligence could make it on his own.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a vile little hate monger, and his anti-white hatred is revealed often in what he says.</p>

			<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t take all that much to collapse wall street. Look to George Soros. He has the money and definitely the desire to do it and get his man elected.</p>

			<p>Whoa! whoa! whoa! Wait a minute. Didn&rsquo;t Obama spit in the face of God by chosing a sodomite bishop to pray at his inauguration ceremony? Didn&rsquo;t Obama spit in the face of Jesus Christ, his very savior, by saying something like: &#8220;America is a nation of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and atheists&#8221; instead of saying, &#8220;we are a Christian nation&#8221;?</p>
<p>Any Christian whose mind hasn&rsquo;t been perverted by the scourge of liberalism knows that the above-mentioned things Obama did and said is considered blasphemous. Through supernatural powers God knows the future. God would not intervene to make someone president who was destined to commit blasphemies infront of the entire world.</p>
<p>Spike Lee needs to get his head out of his rear.</p>

			<p>I wonder if the MSM will begin to feature Black fools more prominently.  Just like the D.C. partygoers mentioned in a posted story yesterday, the news will not be able to keep it White, but will they recycle the same well-spoken Blacks over and over or will they open it up more to people like Spike Lee and Al Sharpton?  </p>

<p>Then again, perhaps God has sent a different omen today regarding the Obamination and multiculturalism in general?</p>
<p>How ironic that good old Teddy Kennedy and Robert Byrd had convulsive fits today, that saw them removed from enjoying their 40 pieces of silver and its &#8220;rewards?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just something to wax ecstatically prophetic about!<br>

			<p>Well, as Steve Sailer points out on vdare.com, it was Blacks and Hispanics that took advantage of the &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; that Democrats created with their minority loans at the expense of prudent lending. And El Presidente&rsquo; Bush took this further along trying to get Hispanics to go Republican by Hispandering. In a sense, the Blacks &#8220;massaged&#8221; the politicians in order that they expell a neverending river of money to the Black community in the form of loans that were never repaid. Diversity Depression is correct!</p>

			<p>Lee is an idiot and this is nonsense. McCain lost primarily because he was a dreadful candidate, period end of story!! He was the perfect symbol of a moribund Republican party - an aging and often confused entity that doesn&rsquo;t have a clue who its(his) real supporters were, or why they support them(him) in the first place.  </p>

			<p>I remember the Malcolm X mania that was going on in the early 90s. I remember Spike Lee saying that Malcolm X&rsquo;s Autobiography &#8220;is the most important book I&rsquo;ll ever read.&#8221; I remember joking about that statement with some goofy white kids at SMSU in Springfield,MO. saying that I doubted that there was a lot of competition in Spike Lee&rsquo;s library for that distinction. Well, I offended them and was treated rather icily after that. I wonder if Spike Lee has learned anything new since 1992, or the college kids for that matter.</p>

			<p>  It&rsquo;s a strange type of divine determinism that Mr. Lee is postulating. Why would God inflict pain and misery on a whole nation just to get a black front man for our greedy privileged elite? Did he pick this up from Reverend Wright?</p>

			<p>I found Spike Lee&rsquo;s comment to be refreshing. NBC could have used him for the TV event of the Century, perhaps, otherwise known as the presidential inaguration.</p>
<p>Did anyone noticed the commercial for the new &#8216;Frost/Nixon&rsquo; movie that was playing during the ceremonies? I didn&rsquo;t at first, and came very close to missing the whole &#8216;thing&rsquo;. It was an interesting juxtiposition of the medias treatment of Nixon, beside the coverage of the event of Century.</p>

			<p>For the life of me, I&rsquo;ve never been able to understand why the organized Left, especially the race hustlers, don&rsquo;t bend over backwards and move mountains to keep Spike Lee off the air.</p>
<p>Seriously, this guy has the emotional and intellectual maturity of a fifteen-year-old. He consistently makes himself look like a fool whenever televised. And since all he ever talks about is black vs. white, he makes his contemporaries look foolish by extension.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Spike Lee is my very favorite spokesman for the Black Movement.</p>

			<p>Stop blaming the former President Bush for the ecomnomic failure.<br>
It has been thought that the DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED HOUSE<br>
stopped a bill that was being introduce by the repulicans.  <br>
Mr. Bush probably got fed up trying to pass legislation to reel<br>
in lending and then said let&rsquo;s get 5.5 million new home owners.<br>
And to hell with the economy.  If you do not want me to fix it<br>
then you&rsquo;ll see the errors of your liberal ways.</p>

<p>Simple, the angry, angry Black Man with the chip on his shoulder is a NECESSARY image from the standpoint of mau-mauing money out of the White Dummy population. By NEVER acknowledging the things Whites have GIVEN Blacks on the premise that Blacks were &#8220;wronged,&#8221; they can in in perpetuity continue to make noise and obtain FREE money from Whitey.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is up to you to make the first step: Just Say NO to Black demands.</p>

			<p>No White should listen to a thing this White-hating idiot says, let alone patronize any of his movies.  In a sane world he would be loudly, publicly excoriated and denounced by Whites, boycotted and put out of business.</p>
<p>The lefty press, for years, has given this noxious loudmouth unlimited coverage to spew hatred towards Whites and anything else he doesn&rsquo;t like with an absolute pass.  Criticism of Spike Lee is akin to criticizing MLK or any other black &#8216;hero.&rsquo; (of course, the MSM agree with everything he says).</p>
<p>Larry Elder reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Academy Award-nominated director said that the National Rifle Association &#8216;should be disbanded&rsquo; and that someone should take its president, actor Charlton Heston, and &#8216;shoot him with a .44-caliber Bulldog.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think would have happened if Heston had said &#8216;someone should take Spike Lee out and shoot him with a .44-caliber Bulldog?&rsquo; </p>
<p>And this little nasty dig at Whites:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;During the publicity campaign for&#8216;&#8220;Malcolm X,&rsquo; Lee stated that because of &#8216;stupid&rsquo; questions by white reporters, Lee preferred to be interviewed by black journalists&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2065</p>
<p>Spread the Word about this &#8216;racist dwarf&rsquo; to everyone you know  &mdash;  boycott his films and anything else he does  &mdash;  if we don&rsquo;t who will?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I think it might be a very entertaining time for us racially-conscious white folks&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started listening to Rush Limbaugh again after finding him insufferable during the Bush years.</p>
<p>I noticed he&rsquo;s started playing a lot of Paul Shanklin&rsquo;s wonderful, hilarious parodies again.  The ones about obama are the best, the impressions dead-on.</p>

<p>Actually their not, they are simply lacking understanding or stating problems that they feel could be fixed. If you ever been to a black town hall meeting or a church meeting you would know that not all blacks blame the problems they face on the white man. Most of them know that the problem is lack of good teachers and parents. Some of them will go as far as to say their own parents act like children. The elders will talk about how people didn&rsquo;t act this bad during their era even when poverty was higher, racism was more prevalent, and the oppurtunity for some crimes where there.</p>
<p>At the school I went to (Fort Pierce Central High School) some black teachers were just as bad as the students. But there were still some that had faith in their students and gave the proper guidance when they needed it.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

			<p>Our country will never recover. Whites need to look out for their own. That starts in the home first.  Care who your sons and daughters are friends with or dating.  You have every right to decide with whom they associate with.   Make your thoughts known when white people ask.  Observable avoidance of black people is the best policy (it drives them and their advocates crazy).  For the weaker of our kind (the white liberal), let them know that they are denying for you the very thing they want to guarantee for non whites.  Then, ostracize them.    Blacks find whites so appalling that they demand to be part of every group or association we create.  They demand to be part of your family life, like it or not.  Now answer them with, NO YOU CANT!</p>

			<p>&#8220;If the economic crisis had anything to with the outcome of the election, we would now have President Mitt Romney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, a week before Mitt Romney ended his Presidential bid, I saw him TV.  Romney seemed like an alright guy and I am sure he would have made a good President.</p>
<p>The reason why John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, and the reason why his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, would have won the Presidency in 1968, had it not been for the conspirators who had arranged these assassinations, is because they were the right kind of WASP Catholics.</p>
<p>The reason why Obama won the 2008 Presidential Election is because he is the right kind light-skinned black, or as many you reading this post would say, the right kind of mulatto.</p>
<p>However, it is iron-clad impossible for either an Atheist, a Jew, or a Mormon to be elected President of the United States of America!</p>
<p>If Mitt Romney was either a Catholic or a Protestant, it is guite likely he would be President now, but he failed his Presidental bid because of his being a Mormon.</p>
<p>In the 2000 Presidential Election, I dearly wanted Al Gore to win.  But because he chose Joseph Lieberman to his running mate, he lost due to anti-semitism.</p>
