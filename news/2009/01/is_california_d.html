<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28625138/">Is California Dreaming Over?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mike Reilly spent his lifetime chasing the California dream. This year he&rsquo;s going to look for it in Colorado.</p>
<p>With a house purchase near Denver in the works, the 38-year-old engineering contractor plans to move his family 1,200 miles away from his home state&rsquo;s lemon groves, sunshine and beaches. For him, years of rising taxes, dead-end schools, unchecked illegal immigration and clogged traffic have robbed the Golden State of its allure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of people leaving California for another state outstripped the number moving in from another state during the year ending on July 1, 2008. California lost a net total of 144,000 people during that period  &mdash;  more than any other state, according to census estimates. That is about equal to the population of Syracuse, N.Y.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Unemployment, home foreclosures up</b></p>
<p>California&rsquo;s loss is extremely small in a state of 38 million. And, in fact, the state&rsquo;s population continues to increase overall because of births and immigration, legal and illegal. But it is the fourth consecutive year that more residents decamped from California for other states than arrived here from within the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Why are so many looking for an exit?</b></p>
<p>Among other things: California&rsquo;s unemployment rate hit 8.4 percent in November, the third-highest in the nation, and it is expected to get worse. A record 236,000 foreclosures are projected for 2008, more than the prior nine years combined, according to research firm MDA DataQuick. Personal income was about flat last year.</p>
<p>With state government facing a $41.6 billion budget hole over 18 months, residents are bracing for higher taxes, cuts in education and postponed tax rebates. A multibillion-dollar plan to remake downtown Los Angeles has stalled, and office vacancy rates there and in San Diego and San Jose surpass the 10.2 percent national average.</p>
<p>Median housing prices have nose-dived one-third from a 2006 peak, but many homes are still out of reach for middle-class families. Some small towns are on the brink of bankruptcy. Normally recession-proof Hollywood has been hit by layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see wages go down and the cost of living go up,&#8221; Reilly says. His property taxes will be $1,300 in Colorado, down from $4,300 on his three-bedroom house in Nipomo, about 80 miles up the coast from Santa Barbara.</p>

		<p>Ironically, Californians are turning Colorado in the same mess from which they fled, and which they created.  AR here had a story a few days ago about blacks leading both chambers of the CO legislature, in spite of the paucity of blacks in the legislature and in the state population.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the AP used &#8220;unchecked illegal immigration.&#8221;  Verily, California is becoming Brazil, with no prospects for a middle class, just the plutocrats and the proles.</p>

President Reagan, when speaking of the Mexican invasion, said, &#8220;let &#8216;em come&#8221;. They have and in overwhelming numbers. However, you can add only so many before you reach a &#8216;critical mass&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s hope we have.</p>

		<p>Unchecked Illegal immigration one of the reasons people are leaving the state</p>
<p>I see it as the result of Democratic control for some forty years. All the money, billions upon hundreds of billions of dollars, wasted on social programs for people who do not belong here. The politicians of California, in the past, and today, have been too stupid, too lazy and too criminal to create a viable immigration policy.</p>
<p>What would have been wrong with following the European example, where work visas are given for six months, and after that time you have to go back to your country, until the next work period, no ifs ands or buts about it. This way the sub-prime mortgage fiasco, the rampant crime, and the political pandering to illegal aliens would have ended. The reconquista Mexican nationalists at heart,(also known as California Democrats) wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to accumulate the raw power they now have in the State.</p>
<p>The truth is that millions of these people would probably rather live in Mexico  &mdash;  especially if the gravy train of benefits that the Democrats give them were taken away. Switzerland and Austria, have a system where temporary workers get six month visas and it just so happens that the cut off date comes right before they are able to receive a &#8220;gravy train&#8221; of benefits. </p>

		<p>Behold, the future Utopian States of America in microcosm:</p>
<p>&#8220;With state government facing a $41.6 billion budget hole over 18 months, residents are bracing for higher taxes, cuts in education and postponed tax rebates. A multibillion-dollar plan to remake downtown Los Angeles has stalled, and office vacancy rates there and in San Diego and San Jose surpass the 10.2 percent national average.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a white population of about 45% or only 17.1 million people (approximately,) one would expect the state to simply be thriving. Why it isn&rsquo;t, just befuddles me to no end; is not diversity, particularly undocumented migratory diversity, our greatest &#8220;strength?&#8221;</p>
<p>So, what went wrong in Disneyland?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if he realizes that Colorado isn&rsquo;t much better, especially regarding illegal immigration and all the negative aspects attendant to it.</p>
<p>I lived there over twenty years ago, and it was pretty bad at that time, and there&rsquo;s no doubt it&rsquo;s worse now, plus the cold Rocky Mountain winters are legend.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for all of Colorado, but Denver and the surrounding area were inundated with Mexicans.  I suspect the rest of Colorado is almost as bad, especially the farm centers.</p>
<p>But, regarding California, I doubt that the state will be  solvent by 2010.  </p>
<p>California is an example of leftist ideology in practice for several years with no opposing ideology to keep it from instituting the far out laws and policies it has, courtesy of a diverse society.  It wasn&rsquo;t until Washington leftists decided to follow the California model, which amounted to giving people homes who couldn&rsquo;t pay for them, that the rest of the country began to collapse and take the rest of the world with it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going down, down, down, folks, and at this point it looks like this train wreck is going to be impossible to stop, not just in California but the entire world.</p>
<p>Each day offers more gloomy economic news.</p>

		<p>Other reasons why Americans are leaving California is that they get kind of tired seeing, graffitti literally everywhere, locking themselves in their homes because of out of control crime, getting out of the car to remove the supermarket cart from their driveway that some illegal alien left there,watching 14-17 year old girls pushing their babies around in carts and imagining how much in increased taxes the care of that child is costing them. Really, there are so many reasons, including the rather mild ones the author mentioned, that are causing people to leave this state. A story in the Lost Angeles Times quoted an admitted illegal alien women who said that she was leaving California with her husband and two kids for Georgia, because California was becoming to much like Mexico. There you have it. But again, Americans can&rsquo;t seem to connect or don&rsquo;t want to connect the dots.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, Whites won&rsquo;t have to become an absolute minority before the system will collapse. We just have to become too small of a percentage of the overall population to carry the weight of Blacks and Hispanics. If there&rsquo;s a sliver lining to our demographic problem, it&rsquo;s this. When Whites are faced with real blows to their life styles, they will wake up. Whites may be willing to live with third world people in their country, but they will never accept third world life-styles for themselves. The biggest problem we face right now with racial awareness is that most Whites are to self-centered to think about the bigger picture, or what America&rsquo;s going to look like fifty years from now. The average young White Person today spends most of their time worrying about what clothes they&rsquo;re going to where, or what this one is saying about that one, and which new singer is in style. There&rsquo;s just to many distractions at the moment. Whites will continue to ignore the real problems facing their future until reality hits them like a blow to the head. When all of a sudden, Whites are out of work, and their homes are being foreclosed on, when they have to go to bed hungry, then they will wake up. They&rsquo;ll have no choice. Many older White Nationalists fear for our cause, because they believe that young Whites have been brain washed, but I really don&rsquo;t think that they have. Wrather, I think that young Whites have been brain clogged. They&rsquo;ve been bombarded with soo much commercialism, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for them to think of anything else. Young Whites may claim to support integration, but it&rsquo;s not because they actually have strong feelings one way or the other. Try listening to a young person express any opinion on anything that&rsquo;s not about pop culture. They stumble all over their words trying to form some type of opinion, but they can&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t have any. They&rsquo;ve never spent much time thinking about anything that doesn&rsquo;t pretain to their immediate lifes. &#8220;Uhh, I like Obama because, like, he uhh, he&rsquo;s gonna bring you know, like change, and uhh, that, uhh, umm, I mean, change is good.&#8221; Young Whites don&rsquo;t have strong feelings about anything, and that ironically enough, should give us hope. Young Whites are basically empty vessels when it comes to ideaology. At the moment, they regurgitate whatever cliche opinions about race and society they need to to keep from making waves or having to actually think. Remember that. YOUNG WHITES DON&rsquo;T HAVE ANY REAL FEELINGS ABOUT INTEGRATION, THEY SIMPLY GO WITH THE FLOW!!! When their decadent life-styles are ripped out from under them, they&rsquo;ll become the greatest foot soldiers our movement could hope for, because they will be completely unbiased by former opinions. They don&rsquo;t have any. We will be able to mold them how we need them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unchecked illegal immigration&#8221;? How about unchecked immigration period. I live next door in Nevada and we are getting the overflow and it&rsquo;s not just Mexicans, it&rsquo;s Asians, Philipino&rsquo;s, Indians, Arabs, you name it. This country doesn&rsquo;t just have an &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; problem, it has a legal immigration problem too. It&rsquo;s just absolute madness to allow the worlds people (millions of whom are unskilled labor) to pour into this country when the economy is in the shape it&rsquo;s in.</p>

		<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s also assault rifle bans and the requirement to have a handgun meet &#8220;Kalifornia&#8221; bans, as well as bans on .50 rifles.</p>
<p>Kalifornia is a facist state in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Ronnie Barrett of Barrett Firearms refuses to sell to Kalifornia law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barrett cannot legally sell any of its products to lawbreakers. Therefore, since California&rsquo;s passing of AB50, the state is not in compliance with the US Constitution&rsquo;s 2nd and 14th Amendments, and we will not sell nor service any of our products to any government agency of the State of California.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here is one of THE major reasons Whites have been fleeing the &#8216;Golden State&rsquo; since the 90s. If you are White and expect to live in a relatively safe area, you will be forced to pay un-Godly mortgage payments and property taxes for a very small house.</p>
<p>Talk show hosts John &amp; Ken opened up their phone lines tonight asking those who are escaping the state to call and state WHY they are leaving.  For most, it was a deteriorating quality of life due to unfettered illegal immigration.  </p>
<p>Parents called to complain bitterly about having to pay heavily to send their children to expensive private schools as the local schools have been completely destroyed by low IQd, disinterested, non-English speaking children of illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Many of the callers spoke of buying &#8216;twice the house&rsquo; for &#8216;half the price&rsquo; (and half the property taxes) in Colorado, Idaho, and Montana.</p>
<p>Other callers vowed to &#8216;stay and fight&rsquo; and not allow our beautiful state to be taken over by colonists who come here and destroy entire communities (it&rsquo;s far to late to take a stance, there are too few of us left to vote the &#8216;rascals&rsquo; out).</p>
<p>The Golden State that once was is gone, never to return.</p>

		<p>What has happened to California is sad. It really was the place to be post WWII until the 80&rsquo;s. The state really is stunning, I totally understand the physical attraction of it. My cousin live in San Diego for 11 yrs., but had to move back because the cost of living is insane. He absolutely hated to come back here, but wanted to beat the coming mortgage storm he saw as a broker. He told me what was going to happen 2 yrs. before it happened. The mortgage crisis may have been the final blow to California financially. Prices are coming down at breathtaking speeds. Other than rich enclaves like Santa Barbara, it is doomed to be a 3rd world rich and poor state. It is truly finished. Think of all the lost spending of all the phony &#8220;equity&#8221; lines. It will probably be ceded culturally to Mexico. Tourism and imports will be the main industry. People will keep visiting. What is not discussed is the nasty affect that California&rsquo;s fall is having on Las Vegas. Most of Vegas revenues still come from weekend trips from Californians. Race does enter in this equation in several areas.<br>
1. It was when California had a majority middle-class white population that it prospered. Beach culture was white culture.<br>
2. California was created by mostly rugged people who settled it when it was a waterless outback with no agriculture to speak of.<br>
3. Tom Mullholland and other brilliant men helped build the most fantastic reservoir and canal system the world has ever seen. Without is, the southwest we see today does not exist. Las Vegas gets about 6 inches of rain a year. No way does it exist without brilliant engineering of Hoover Dam. No way. <br>
4.Alot of fantasies that Hispanics harbor about Americans &#8220;stealing&#8221; the southwest is they see what it looks like now. Vegas, L.A., San Diego, Phoenix, and Albuqueque are all montrosities that rose out of nothing. What it is impossible to tell anybody who has not been to the southwest ( I have been there 4 times) is this is some of the harshest desert on the planet. White engineering built the southwest as we now know it!<br>
If it changes hands, you will see the gradual disrepair and disintergration of all the canals and dams, which, if if happened with the present populations, would be a biblical catastraphe. That is the reality of the southwest which will reveal itself sooner or later. There is one enclave in the southwest that seems to be thriving. Utah. Take a wild guess which ethnic group dominates the culture and population of that state. Do I really need to say?<br>

<p>John, you couldn&rsquo;t imagine it. Besides the things you pointed out, serious crime was extremely low, California does not have the humidity of say Florida, a state it is sometimes compared to,and beautiful beaches, as well as some Alpine like mountains. Even unique deserts. Under a long time Republican Administration,it built some of the most beautifully planned infrastructure as well as, Universities, highways, roads, etc.  The Democrats along with some Republican traitors have destroyed it all. One could argue that they ruined the most promising state in the nation  &mdash;  a superstate really, a self sufficient entity that even supplied much of the rest of the nation and some of the world with all kinds of things.</p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>More than you can ever imagine.</p>
<p>I was born in LA and am old enough to remember when there were large ranches and huge citrus and walnut groves covering the valley.  I remember a time when the beaches were pristine, the water was blue and clear and neighborhoods were clean, safe and graffiti-free. I remember when English was the prevailing language, not Spanish, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages that must now be accommodated.</p>
<p>I think the turning point in LA was the Watts Riot of 1965  &mdash;  I remember my dad showing me the smoke rising from the city (we lived in the hills above LA at the time). The entire city became entirely different after that as Whites fled riot-prone areas and blacks moved in (Watts was originally an Italian/White community as was Compton).</p>
<p>Even then, in the late 60s I can remember my dad talking about an increasing population of non taxpayers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s not alive to see what his native state has turned into (he was born here in 1923). </p>
<p>All I can do now is look at old &#8216;before&rsquo; pictures of LA and even those in my own photo albums and remember what a paradise it once was in Southern California  &mdash;  a paradise my own children will never know, that will never be known again.</p>

<p>But if you join us in the Northwest, please learn how to <i>not act like the now-typical Californian.</i> Respect the local people and traditions, buy local, and give back to your new communities. Keep a low profile. Don&rsquo;t be a busybody out to cleanse the world. And remember why you left the failed state, and do the exact opposite of what was acceptable and &#8220;cool&#8221; there.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, as a former Californian living in the NW for six years now, I have to disagree with first, all the gloating - as if it couldn&rsquo;t happen to you or it is somehow White Californians who caused it - and second, that it wasn&rsquo;t happening in other places already.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans have for a long time skipped right through California for the Eastern Oregon and Washington farms, whose White owners also didn&rsquo;t care about legality.  Same goes for farmers in Colorado and all the Midwest.  Since being up here, I see much more race mixing than I did in California.  The crime is also catching up to California&rsquo;s quickly everywhere.  Whites also seem more susceptible to illicit drug use and Oregon has been the meth capital of the U.S. for some time now.</p>
<p>In the early 1990&rsquo;s California had a last chance to save itself.  Under the leadership of Governor Pete Wilson a proposition (189) that would have banned payment for medical and school for illegals was PASSED.  But it was overturned in a lawsuit led by MECHA and La Raza.  The State capital was host to large numbers of Hispanics crowding daily into the Assembly Chamber and shouted and yelled everytime any lawmaker tried to make a case for instituting 189.  Similar activities by the Hispanic population in Sacramento have been common since that time.  The point is that it is harboring populations of Hispanics that caused California to capsize, not the White people lack of attentiveness or voting record.  </p>
<p>Since 189&rsquo;s failure, California has steadily declined to where it is today.  It has often been said that things start in California first.  I think this is exactly the case here and other states are not learning the right lessons from this one.  I am always amazed at so many Whites up here who seem to be completely naive concerning the Hispanic problem in California.  Portland is inundated with Hispanics now as are all the cities along the I-5 corridor in Oregon.  Like most towns and cities in California, 90% of the crime stats show Spanish surnames.  (Although that is changing a bit now due to the &#8220;recession&#8221;).</p>
<p>I remember California in the 1950s and 1960s.  Although I grew up in No. Cal, which is a completely different place than So. Cal I recall how nice LA and San Diego was then.  But that&rsquo;s just it.  California filled up with Midwestern bumpkins and East coast sharks who turned it into what it became later.  Mainly, New York lawyers who wanted to turn every nice little town into their own little kingdom and ban this and ban that.  The Midwesterners just excentuated the naive, gullible, disposible society that natives (like me) began to try to prevent by starting movements for stiffer litering laws, saving land from more development, etc.  It didn&rsquo;t prevent much in the end.  Don&rsquo;t argue, I lived through it.  The Mexican - Hispanic thing came after that.  It was already a mess, however.</p>

<p>Unfortunately true.  But again, this is well on the way nationwide.  It just happened there first.</p>
<p>And, not to seem too irate - it&rsquo;s California, not Kalifornia.  And only non-Californians say or write &#8220;Cali.&#8221;  When doing this, one is merely engaging in the same arrogance that seems to claim that it could never happen here and &#8220;Cali&#8221; is a place we can all look down on with satisfaction.  No, the situation in California and what has happened to it is a warning.  </p>
<p>Those who think we ought to cut in out of the union are simply giving in to La Raza who claimed they would take it &#8220;back&#8221; for Mexico.  You mean that you guys are going to let a country as weak and dumb as Mexico take a state of the Union?  One that has until recently contributed more wealth the longest to America than any other state?</p>
<p>I left California because I had to.  I was a victim of too many crimes and my long term strategic planning told me that I needed to be in a wetter climate.  But simply ceded territory to Mexico is defeatist and backward.  Perhaps after this country gets over the Black Superman myth as it applies to the presidency, we will see a true American leader return.  One who might begin to set things right.  The MSM taiks a great deal about hope these days, but that is both my hope and prediction.</p>

BUT people come from some third world country and set up housekeeping. HOW DO THEY DO IT? How do these third worlders come from total poverty and take up some of the most attractive real estate in America? How can people who could barely survive in New Orleans move to San Diego and make it? If you have the answer please let me know. And how do they actually Take Over these areas to where it&rsquo;s not safe for a white American to walk, many times even in daylight?</p>

		<p>White people can be cynical for no reason. Migration to California had nothing to do with the exodus. It was the high tax policies of the Davis/Swartzznegar adimins. The lack of jobs is due largely to the lost of industry, thanks to iverregulation and Free Trade. The presence of immigrants is bnenificial to the local economy but wasn&rsquo;t enough to offset the desaterous impact of federal and state policies.</p>
<p>For those of you who decry &#8220;amnesty&#8221;, then you are falling into the trap that Tancredo and his World Government flock set for you. Look at the facts: undocumented Americans performing low-end jobs for lowend wages are putting more into the economy than they get out of it. With lower wages they cannot afford the goods and services, particularly luxeries, purchased by &#8220;real&#8221; Americans who&rsquo;s wages still rose despite the presence of such immigrants. If these immigrants had not come to fill these low-end jobs than Whites would otherwise be working for the same disgraceful wages that the Mexicans are working for since there would be no one else left to do those jobs. </p>
<p>Legalization actually works against the immigrants insofar as they will be paying higher taxes working those jobs with nothing else to gain. However, the simple American ideal of justice and fairness justifies legalization being that it would be moraly right. So I support, albiet, reluctlantly, a legalization program. Even one that would force people to learn an alien language and pay fines that should otherwise be paid to them. And legalization would secure the borders: no one would have a reason to cross illegaly. So don&rsquo;t fall into the Tancredo/Sessions CFR trap. A free country is a sovergn country. Right now, we are swampped with illegal immigrants, lower standard of living, rampant crime, an overburdoned healthcare system, and crowded schools. Do you want immigration reform or more of this? Use your heads. </p>

<p>One can still find a great life in California - it just isn&rsquo;t perfect in everyway. There are lots of great White people in the state. California has more White people in this state then any other state in the union.</p>
<p>For those of us who have lived in New York City - experienced the great with the horrible, I say California is a good experience, especially for anyone with WN views. There are a lot less blanko Whites there. I worked on California political campaigns with high quality, White candidates who were not IDIOTS on the issues of NW crime, immigration. We won our campaigns.</p>
<p><br>
My advice for living a good life not THE good life in California is to be creative, think of the state as Manhattan like - don&rsquo;t insist on owning a 3 bedroom, two garage home like all White Americans demanded in the 1950s. Just have a safe place to crash, keep a few things, live your entire life outside of your home - outside, on the beaches, on the mountains, on the great roads.<br>

		<p>For everyone who does not live in California, I plead with you to support the transfer of Federal Tax income from your states to California.  Only by collecting massive taxes from White citizens in solvent states and transferring those funds to California, can we save that Minority-majority state.  </p>
<p>There are millions of Mexican children in California who need to be educated.  Likewise nearly 1/2 of California&rsquo;s prison population is Hispanic. Because many illegal immigrants and their children cannot speak English, have no skills, don&rsquo;t finish high school, are in trouble with the law, take drugs, and are often unmarried with children, they cannot earn much money and therefore the government needs to support their housing, medical care, food, utilities, transportation, drug re-hab programs, etc.  Also, Hispanics have really big families, so it takes a lot of money!  We ask our government to either print more money or raise taxes, in order to bail out California.  I know that this will mean less money and more inflation for your family, and less funding for your state, but please consider trying to do with less.  For example, not having children   &mdash;   that way, there will be more money and room for Mexicans.  Also, try to become unemployed   &mdash;   that will open a job for a needy  immigrant.  Also, this may be hard to believe, but there are still 100 million Mexicans (let alone billions and billions of other Third World refugees)who have NOT YET immigrated to California!!!   So, America, roll up your sleeves and open your checkbooks.  Prepare to downsize like you&rsquo;ve never downsized before.  We have a lot of work ahead.  California is only the first immigrant-caused bankruptcy   &mdash;   New York will soon follow, and many other states after that.  Remember, foreigners are more important than your family   &mdash;   more important than your children   &mdash;   more important than America itself.  Please support the California bailout.</p>

<p>The Untold Story of American Workers Vs. Illegal Immigration</p>
<p>Many of America&rsquo;s print media publications are now facing well deserved financial extinction due to their penchant for bias, censorship, and promotions of unpopular political positions, rather than reporting facts. No issue illustrates their heavy bias more than illegal immigration.</p>
<p><br>
American readers are bombarded on a daily basis with the latest illegal alien sob stories about how illegal aliens are getting laid off, being profiled, discriminated against, or finding it harder to get licenses and government benefits from mean and hateful Americans, while the most important part of the story is conspicuously absent! </p>
<p>The Americans who are falling down in historic numbers are not in these articles or publications! </p>
<p>Americans are losing their wages, jobs, homes, health, and sanity in numbers unprecedented since the Great Depression, yet you will not hear their trials and troubles in your elitist newspapers. And if you do get a glimpse of the horror of your neighbors and fellow countrymen, you will most certainly never hear of what I will speak of next.</p>
<p>So American workers are facing what I call &#8220;The Great American Replacement Act&#8221; where Americans are being replaced in jobs, homes, schools, colleges, and at the ballot box through rampant illegal immigration combined with historically high levels of new worker visas being issued.</p>

<p>You sound like Ben [people aren&rsquo;t leaving California because of illegal aliens] Wattenberg.</p>
<p>The reason California taxing and spending is out of control is to cover the costs of the welfare state. That illegals earn the lowest wages means they need welfare systems to pick up the slack their paychecks and employer benefits don&rsquo;t cover. As for illegals paying into the system, how many illegals pay any form of income tax on their under-the-table money?</p>
<p>What you are describing are the symptoms and not the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>The cause of Californias&rsquo; financial implosion is undeniably illegal immigrants.<br>

<p>  Not really, illegal immigrants are taking more from social services  &mdash;   housing, education, health, etc. than Americans. In addition, how do illegal immigrants pay taxes if they are here illegally? How do they benefit taxpayers? As far as illegals taking jobs no one wants, Americans will work any job that pays a living wage. I think many of the people who suffer most from unchecked illegal immigration are the poor and disadvantaged, which incidently includes many blacks and Hispanics. </p>

		<p>  I used to work in manufacturing in SoCal.  An 18 year old White kid could walk into a shop and get a full time job running a drill press for minimum wage.  He could support himself, barely,  and learn some skills.  Maybe if he&rsquo;d taken shop classes in high school he&rsquo;d start out at higher pay.  Life was good.  <br>
     Once, somebody stole $11 worth of groceries from my dad&rsquo;s unlocked car.  Crime was so low then that they saw fit to send TWO cops to investigate.  Now they won&rsquo;t even come to your house if your car is stolen.<br>
     That was California.</p>

		<p>Mike Reilly spent his lifetime chasing the California dream. This year he&rsquo;s going to look for it in Colorado&hellip;</p>
<p>I take it Mr. Reilly HAS NOT done his homework&hellip;if he did he would realize that Colorado&hellip;ESPECIALLY Denver&hellip;has an immigration problem too!</p>
<p>With a house purchase near Denver in the works, the 38-year-old engineering contractor plans to move his family 1,200 miles away from his home state&rsquo;s lemon groves, sunshine and beaches. For him, years of rising taxes, dead-end schools, unchecked illegal immigration and clogged traffic have robbed the Golden State of its allure&hellip;</p>
<p>While his house purchase may be working for him&hellip;Denver has the SAME rising taxes, dead-end schools, unchecked illegal immigration and clogged traffic&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see wages go down and the cost of living go up,&rdquo; Reilly says. His property taxes will be $1,300 in Colorado, down from $4,300 on his three-bedroom house in Nipomo, about 80 miles up the coast from Santa Barbara&hellip;</p>
<p>Give it TIME Mr. Reilly&hellip;give it TIME!</p>

<p>Legalization will result in the complete racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. No one would dispute this. </p>
<p>The number one issue that ranks way ahead of every other issue is the racial transformation of America by post-1965 immigration policy. I oppose with every fiber of my being legalizing the invasion from Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration must be shut down to 0. LEGAL IMMIGRATION must be shut down to 0. Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221;-like the one named Hsu who wrote an  essay about US in the most recent issue of the Atlantic Monthly- who are in-your-face enthusiastic about making Native Born White Americans a racial minority within the borders of America are part of the fifth column element from China. They must be deported also. Deporting muslims is an obvious thing to do.</p>
<p>Soon enough, REALITY will kick the teeth in of all these foolish Native Born White Males who spend their precious time on this planet in fantasy football leagues. Their wives will cheat on them.  They will eventually be replaced with a young asian &#8220;American&#8221; at work. It is going to very very painfull, but they willl eventually get it.<br>

		<p>Unchecked illegal immigration?  That sounds like &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk.  It has nothing to do with the immigrant&rsquo;s status; it&rsquo;s about race!  Whites don&rsquo;t want to live around mestizos no matter how they got here.  </p>
<p>Many conservatives only go after illegal immigration out of fear of being labeled racist, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the immigrants are legal or illegal.  All it matters is if they&rsquo;re white or not, and these immigrants aren&rsquo;t.  </p>

<p>Are you kidding us?  The poor illegals.<br>
The reason that &#8220;low-end&#8221; jobs have low-end wages is because that illegals have flooded the labor pool.  What&rsquo;s the incentive for employers to raise wages?  No, Americans would NOT be working for these same wages, since  &mdash;  as you say  &mdash;  there would be no one else left to do these jobs (ridiculous), wages would rise to compete for labor.  &#8220;Low-end&#8221; jobs got done just fine in the past before illegal &#8220;help&#8221;.</p>
<p>They put nothing in and take away more that they can ever repay in two lifetimes.  Every spare cent gets sent home in the form of remissions, and they happily take advantage of our free education, social services, and every charity to speak of.</p>
<p>Legalization will not raise their wages, it will not raise the standard of living, it will not lower crime, it will not uncrowd the schools, or ease the burden on social services. They most likely will never make enough money to ever have to pay any taxes.  And it certainly will not secure our borders.  </p>
<p>It is &#8220;morally right&#8221;?  It not our obligation to support Planet Earth, we are a people trying to survive like any other country.<br>
We are already generous to a fault.<br>
Sometimes folks just have to learn to do for themselves and fix their own houses.  Too many of them want to take the easy way out and look to Uncle Sam to fix it for them.<br>
We so often hear how the assorted downtrodden are so industrious, so entreprenurial, so religious, so family-oriented, and just so  &mdash;  well  &mdash;  just so damn good!  And with vibrant communities yet!  With all these virtuous qualities, wouldn&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;d pick themselves up by their bootstraps and make a livable country? </p>

		<p>Munoz, I agree with some of your post, but, legalizing millions of people here illegally, means the subsequent chain migration of all of their relatives  &mdash;  every last one of them. Is that good for this country  &mdash;  no it isn&rsquo;t, in fact its what you call more of it. Furthermore, Mexicans take more than they give, because of the high amount of children they have and &hellip;.well, this stuff if so well documented by now. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I would go for,  the deportation of all illegal aliens from Mexico and elsewhere, and then the setting up of a work visa program for all the low end jobs, like so many European nations do. When your stint is over, you take your cash go home and apply to come next period. That would be a plan instituted by a nation that has leaders who care about the nation and its founders. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be a plan instituted by the traitors we have in government today.</p>

		<p>I do sympathize with Californians who are fleeing the No-Longer-So-Golden State. But in a way, I feel the same toward them as I do to the illegal aliens streaming acrosss our borders every day. They have to take some responsibility for what has happened to their state over the last 50 years. Also, they tend to take the big money they make on the sale of their homes in Kali, and buy big chunks of land here in Colorado, and play the same property games that they played in Kali. I&rsquo;ve noticed that  a lot of them try to get on the city council in the smaller towns and attempt to force the discredited liberalism of L.A, San Diego and San Francisco on the mining and ranching communities here, which makes them about as popular as a rattlesnake at a square dance.</p>

&#8220;White people can be cynical for no reason. Migration to California had nothing to do with the exodus. It was the high tax policies of the Davis/Swartzznegar adimins.&#8221;  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t usually bother arguing with people who spell as badly  as you do   &mdash;   but I will respond this time because I have a personal stake in this question. Because I am living proof that the above statement is WRONG. </p>
<p>I pulled out of So. California in 2006 PRECISELY BECAUSE of the mestizo invasion. I left PRECISELY BECAUSE California was turning into Mexifornia before my very eyes. </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because of &#8220;high taxes.&#8221; It wasn&rsquo;t because of what you call the &#8220;Davis/Swartzznegar adimins.&#8221; None of these things would have been enough to drive me out of my beloved Golden State. </p>
<p>No, Senor Munoz: The overwhelming factor in my decision was that I was getting sick to death of watching 1st World America turn into 3rd World Mexico every time I stepped outside my front door. Sick of reading in the papers EVERY DAY about all the hispanic criminals wanted by the police; and about all the hispanic drunk drivers slaughtering the innocent on our freeways; and about all the low-scoring hispanic children clogging up our classrooms.</p>
<p>Sick of being forced to play a game of charades several times a day with an endless parade of dim-witted, apathetic (yet vaguely hostile) retail staff, waitstaff, valets, and EVERY OTHER KIND of unskilled worker with NO ENGLISH AT ALL. And   &mdash;   more important   &mdash;   who seemed very dedicated to the idea of NEVER learning English. NEVER assimilating into America. NEVER being anything more than the dull, unambitious, barely competent, mixed-blood peasants that they were back in &#8220;Mexico viejo.&#8221; </p>
<p>If some miracle man can get the Mexicans out of California, I&rsquo;ll happily return. Not before. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Look at the facts: undocumented Americans performing low-end jobs for lowend (sic) wages are putting more into the economy than they get out of it&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what &#8216;facts&rsquo; might those be?  BTW: Those who are undocumented are NOT Americans and do not belong here to feed off of American taxpayers. And illegal aliens certainly DO NOT<br>
put more into the economy than they get out of it.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants are able to access &#8216;free&rsquo; health care through emergency room services and &#8216;free&rsquo; educations for their children (at a cost of approximately $10,000/child  &mdash;  if the kid needs &#8216;special services&rsquo; as MANY immigrant children do, the cost doubles, ESL services add 25% more to the cost of educating a child).</p>
<p>From Ed Rubenstein:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Public policy has exacerbated the ER crisis. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), enacted in 1986, requires every emergency room in the country to treat the uninsured for free.</p>
<p>While Hispanics account for about 15 percent of U.S. population, they generated nearly half of 2005&rsquo;s uninsured population growth. . Fox News reports that &#8216;Sixty percent of [LA County&rsquo;s] uninsured patients are not U.S. citizens. More than half are here illegally.&rsquo; </p>
<p>And immigrants (legal and illegal) get more than medical treatment. A &#8216;disability&rsquo; diagnosis automatically qualifies them for Supplemental Security Income, a federally funded cash transfer payment&hellip;The numbers are staggering&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/rubenstein/050616_nd.htm</p>
<p>Wonder who pays for that?  Illegal immigrants working for cash in low-paying jobs?   Uncompensated medical costs forced 84 California hospitals to close over the past decade. </p>
<p>VDARE.com also reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In a recent article in The Social Contract Magazine, Romero updates his 1994 study [Racing Backwards &mdash; The Fiscal Impact of Illegal Immigration in California, Revisited (Summer 2007)].</p>
<p>He now estimates that California&rsquo;s illegals receive from $9.6 billion to $38.2 billion more state services than they pay in state taxes&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/awall/070219_memo.htm</p>
<p>From Hispanics:  A Statistical Portrait:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Center for Immigration Studies, using estimates developed by the National Academy of Sciences, calculates that over a lifetime, the average adult Mexican immigrant will collect $55,200 more in government services than he or she will pay in taxes&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>You are free to present your own facts and figures to dispute Romero&rsquo;s study, the National Academy of Sciences and the Center for Immigration Studies.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman was correct when he stated:  &#8220;It&rsquo;s just obvious that you can&rsquo;t have free immigration and a welfare state.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lex Concord is no doubt using &#8220;literary license&#8221; when writing about the Californians who he says try to take over local politics in CO and turn things into mini versions of the place they&rsquo;ve fled. The middle class whites who leave CA aren&rsquo;t into politics. That&rsquo;s part of the problem. It&rsquo;s the &#8220;advance scouts&#8221; of the elites who follow the middle class, see where they&rsquo;re going, then move in and set up shop to ruin yet another white enclave. As to white Californians being responsible for the immigration mess. No they aren&rsquo;t. No more than the people in Minn are responsible for Somalians or Hmong cruising in and ruining things. It&rsquo;s the hostile to ordinary whites US govt that is responsible. Denver CO is turning into a huge dump due to mestizos and blacks. Is that really the fault of the whites who&rsquo;ve lived there for decades?  Not really, no. Just as Detroit&rsquo;s ruin was not the fault of the whites who had lived there, made the city thrive, for a long time before the influx of blacks turned it into Zimbabwe on the Great Lakes.</p>

		<p>By the way Whiteplight, it was Prop 187, not 189, and your roundabout attempt to run-down the Southern end of the state is typical of arrogant Northern CA libs, especially calling the Midwesterners simpletons in comparisons to the &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221;. The Midwesterners built the Aerospace and Tech industries. The &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221;, meaning East Coast rabble rousers, were here to begin destroying the West just as their cohorts had already destroyed the East and much of the Midwest like Detroit . Calling them &#8220;sharks&#8221; makes it sound as if you admire them. You say you grew up in Northern CA and then tell us you lived through the crumbling of Southern CA. A little inconsistent. CA&rsquo;s major problems came from DC and NWO leaning politicos from CA, most of whom were from the North end of the state.  If anyone is naive it&rsquo;s the Northern folks who are constantly blindsided by blacks and browns because so many of them are still in a beautiful fog, believing the liberal lies about us &#8220;all being the same&#8221; etc. </p>
<p>The reason there was so much talk about CA splitting in two was because those darn red-neck Southern Californians were tired of paying most of the taxes that supported the criminal activity up North in Sacramento and the circus going on in SF. All the North end of the state would say is that the South end of the state was getting their water from &#8220;up here&#8221;. The silly bickering was typical, and just what the elites wanted. That way whites wouldn&rsquo;t pay attention to the real problems until it was too late. </p>

 If the millions of Mexicans never came. low-end employers would have to do one of two things:<br>
1/. Shut up shop completely and allow higher value-added production make better use of scarce resources.(This is the only real motor of rising productivity and incomes through the ages).<br>

		<p>This is more of a question than a comment. How Do They Do It? I have always had an above average income and have looked at California as a home BUT with even homes in the 1000 S.F. range selling in the Million Dollar price range (that would be a $10,000 a month payment) I have always had to pass. BUT people come from some third world country and set up housekeeping. HOW DO THEY DO IT? How do these third worlders come from total poverty and take up some of the most attractive real estate in America? How can people who could barely survive in New Orleans move to San Diego and make it? If you have the answer please let me know. And how do they actually Take Over these areas to where it&rsquo;s not safe for a white American to walk, many times even in daylight?</p>
<p>Posted by T Rexx at 9:59 AM on January 14 </p>
<p>This is why they have to get their extended family in with them, or get them over soon&hellip;.</p>
<p>They have multiple families, in many cases three generations, living in rental houses or apartments, and in many cases the landlords never know or don&rsquo;t care.  When the places get torn up, they write the depreciation as a loss on their taxes.</p>
<p>By having all those people (and income) in the house, they have a built-in cook, laundress, housekeeper, mechanic, gardener, handyman, and entertainment in the form of the kids.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go through drive throughs as much as we do, they don&rsquo;t send their laundry up or let it pile up, they are very organized, and they don&rsquo;t pay expensive bills.  They also collect as much as they possibly can from the public trough so they get it free.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the family migration is encouraged because the singles (usually men) just get into too much trouble when they&rsquo;re alone or grouped up with other men, so in the long run it&rsquo;s probably cheaper to import the families.  I&rsquo;ll tell ya though, it&rsquo;s wearisome to have to pay for all of it and be treated like dirt.  They see the tiredness on my face and have no clue how hard someone really has to work to support them.<br>

		<p>  In response to Whites Get Together: no literary license involved. I live here in Colorado and I see that the type of behaviour I describe is overwhelmingly by Californians. Not exclusively, but certainly overwhelmingly. As for who is at fault- ALL white people are at fault, over the last 3 or 4 generations, for being frogs in the slowly heating pot of water that our government has evolved into while we look on fascinated, but failing to take timely and insufficient action.</p>

Exactly. So did I, and I can say precisely the same.  And I can endorse Bon&rsquo;s  very true comments as well.</p>
<p>I left as a young man, entering the Air Force in the 60&rsquo;s and did not return for many years. When I did, only recently, seeing it now through the eyes of an elderly person, it was a SHOCK!</p>
<p>About a year ago, someone here gave a link for an extremely interesting electronic map. (I wish I had saved it.)  It changed colors over the decades, showing the demographic changes taking place in Los Angeles county. The Mexican presence, which was so tiny as to be negligible in 1960, became gradually larger and then overwhelming as time progressed. So did the Asian presence as it increased massively. The blacks shifted locales, as they were pushed out by the invading Hispanics.</p>
<p>Another thing Inoticed:  what was once sunshine, open space, and blue sky has been replaced with cluttered tract housing, congestion, and smog. The lemon groves are long gone, replaced with shopping malls (many of them totally Hispanic or Asian) and freeway exchanges. The mountain views are also gone   &mdash;   obscured with smog. </p>
<p>And the cost of living then was low.  Housing and food were very cheap, back then, incredibly so compared to now. California which was then a bargain place is now very expensive, with housing  prices that are astronomical. Much worse than the East Coast.  Back then it was the reverse. </p>
<p>But in all truth, by the 50s, Los Angeles was already a BIG metropolis. Congested too.  Drugs were becoming known. The anarchist movement was under way in Berkeley (by New Yorkers). Even then we were getting smog in LA, as I recall,  which could be bad on hot summer days   &mdash;    a sign of worse things to come. Of course, it&rsquo;s all much worse now. But to speak of California as a paradise, I think (though that was before my time) you would have to go back to the era before the war (WW2).  Industry and population flooded in during the War, changing everything forever.   The 20s and 30s were the heyday of Hollywood, with space and abundance for everyone. They are forever gone.  But some real estate speculators have gotten very rich, no doubt. A lot of good it will do them!  As for the rest of us, in quality of life, we have gotten relatively poorer.  </p>
<p>California was a white state then, with just a few small minorities who caused no trouble. It was indeed a paradise   &mdash;   America&rsquo;s  Promised Land of milk and honey.  I feel sorry for those  younger persons who never knew  California when it was beautiful, open, safe and clean.  It was a dream that has been turned into a nightmare by stupid politicians, subversive academics, militant ethnic groups, and greedy speculators.  They could not leave well enough alone!</p>

		<p>Thanks for the answer, Lex!  I don&rsquo;t blame all whites, not at all. They&rsquo;ve been hypnotized, for sure, by the media, while the politicians who ran the country took money or like cowards backed off from the media, and sold the country out. Whites won&rsquo;t break out of the fog until they have nowhere to run. And that time is coming. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t bother running. I have seen who has been mucking things up in Aspen, Denver, never mind places in Oregon, Wash and so on. It&rsquo;s the advance guard. It isn&rsquo;t Joe Sixpack. Keep your eye on the people &#8220;in charge&#8221;. They mean all of us harm. </p>

		<p>TabuLa Raza:  Thanks so much for those remarkable maps. (This time I shall save them!)  It is astounding that you saw my comment. </p>
<p>They confirm my memory exactly.  In 1940, there was no hint of any measurable Hispanic presence in the entire region &hellip; so minuscule was it then.  In 1950, there appeared a tiny kernel of them, a seed colony, in East LA.   In the San Fernando Valley,  where I had lived, there were still none when I left (1960).  By 1990, they had spread all over;  and when I visited it recently, around 2000,  the Valley was &#8220;gone&#8221; &hellip; it looked like Tijuana.  </p>
<p>At the North Hollywood subway station (all new) there were garish Mexican murals (just like Mexico City) brazenly describing (in Spanish)  how the outsider Gringos came and stole &#8220;our land&#8221; from &#8220;us&#8221;.   (&#8220;Us&#8221; being from the Mexican point of view, and the thieves being we Americans.) I don&rsquo;t know how the civic authorities have allowed this outrage!  Truly, it has become today a foreign country. We lost it - just passively gave it up -  without even firing a shot.</p>

		<p>California was created by mostly rugged people who settled it when it was a waterless outback with no agriculture to speak of.</p>
<p>Tom Mullholland and other brilliant men helped build the most fantastic reservoir and canal system the world has ever seen. Without it, the Southwest that we see today would not exist. Las Vegas gets about 6 inches of rain a year. No way could it exist without the brilliant engineering of the Hoover Dam. No way. </p>
<p><b>A lot of fantasies that Hispanics harbor about Americans &ldquo;stealing&rdquo;  the southwest is that they see what it looks like now.  Vegas, L.A., San Diego, Phoenix, and Albuquerque are all monstrosities that arose out of nothing.  What it is impossible to tell anybody who has not been to the southwest  is  that this is some of the harshest desert on the planet. White engineering built the southwest as we now know it! </b></p>
<p>If it changes hands, you will see the gradual disrepair and disintegration of all the canals and dams, which, if happens with the present populations, would be a biblical catastrophe.<br>

The above observations are SO, SO  true!   They can&rsquo;t be emphasized enough.   Hispanics  look and see what is there now. They like it;  and they want it &#8220;back&#8221;.   Problem is, <b>what they see was never theirs. They never had it in the first place.  What they see was all built by Americans. </b> Americans took a barren, scorched  patch of desert and BUILT it into what it is today.  When Mexico had possession (which was brief), it was nothing,  it was unpopulated,  and even THEY didn&rsquo;t want to live there!</p>
<p>The notion that they would take these flourishing farms and  cities &#8220;back&#8221;  is preposterous, since these didn&rsquo;t exist  in 1846, beyond (at most) a tiny pueblo of a couple of hundred starving souls. The entire (Spanish-speaking) population of California was then only 5,000.  Being acquired by the USA was the best thing that ever happened to them.  That&rsquo;s why their countrymen still in Mexico are desperate to sneak <i>into </i> the USA now.   Revert back to Mexico?  Idiotic!   The ones still there are trying to get OUT of Mexico!</p>

		<p>Echoing Jackers here in the Sierra foothills in Central CA, where I spend a lot of time. It really is quite nice up here folks, beautiful scenery, almost no crime, friendly people, slow pace of life, no one cares about money, old-time American values. And tons of religion for you fundamentalists and hardcore conservatism for you rightwingers. There are a few non-Whites in these parts, but they&rsquo;re generally well assimilated and don&rsquo;t cause problems. The illegals have been taking off for about a year now. OTOH, I live 35 miles away in the Hell of Northern Tijuana, Central Valley. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting state, and it isn&rsquo;t completely ruined yet.</p>

		<p>The whole idea of the &#8220;laid-back California lifestyle&#8221; is now a sad anachronism.  San Francisco is becoming Manhattan West more and more everyday.  The young adults of the city are almost defined by their avariciousness, and whether you are a worker or an artist the basic values are the same: godlessness, narcissism, and utter incapacity towards introspection.</p>
<p>I am not convinced that America is finished, though I am coming to the conclusion that California probably is.  Most - if not all - of the things that made California what it is were done by white people.  I find it very hard to believe that the immigrant majority will show the same respect to the state that those who built it did&hellip;. the respect for nature and wilderness, not to mention the respect for the cleanliness of their own streets.</p>
<p>Will these people care about the various environmental problems and challenges the state faces (now being met by groups that are almost exclusively white)?</p>

		<p>California is financially bankrupt.  The cost of social policies have far exceeded the benefits, as well as its ability to pay for these things.  It will sink under its own weight.  Sadly the US govt will likely step up with a bailout, perpetuating the imbalances.  The failed experiment will go on, ironically supported by US taxpayers from all corners of the country.  Too bad.  It would have been an all telling object lesson.</p>

		<p>At the time of the Mexican War (the first one, the one that was declared), California had, I think, 7000 people, excluding some wild Indians.  About 3000 of those people were Americans, many of them sailors who decided not to return to New England when their ships stopped at San Pedro, Monterey, or Yerba Buena (Frisco).  The local gentry welcomed them, despite the anti-immigration policies of Mexico City, because these Yankees knew how to get things done.  They quickly acquired ranchos, built sawmills and boatyards, and otherwise invigorated the economy of an isolated Mexican province.  And they married into the best local families.  If you look at the California flag, it says &#8220;CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC&#8221;.  When war broke out between the U.S. and Mexico, the Americans and many of the Californios rushed to declare themselves independent of the corrupt government in Mexico City, and the &#8220;Bear State Flag&#8221; they adopted is now the state flag.  For the brief time that it lasted the new nation had a bi-lingual constitution, modeled on that of the U.S.  When the U.S. Navy showed up in Monterey, the newly independent nation was willing to become a U.S. territory, not least in order to keep the British from claiming California as their own.  California wasn&rsquo;t stolen from Mexico, it seceded.<br>
     Before it was even U.S. territory, California was being built by Americans because not enough Mexicans had the initiative to do anything.  That has always been the case, and the Reconquista won&rsquo;t change a thing.  Let&rsquo;s see how the Mexicans deal with massive brush fires and earthquakes, or maintaining all the aqueducts.  </p>

		<p>I think California will follow the Miami model and become a vast no-go zone for whites.  Twenty years ago Miami was a hot destination place to go.  Now, when was the last time you heard a co-worker say he or she is going to Miami for vacation?  The same will hold true for California.  The CA governor&rsquo;s recent ad campaign to promote tourism, showing California as it used to be  &mdash;  a sort of Beach Boys-influenced campfire-on-the-beach paradise  &mdash;  is a last gasp and kind of a sad glimpse at how things used to be.  </p>

<p>Miami is still a happening place as long as you avoid Overtown, Liberty City and certain areas of Coconut Grove.  It&rsquo;s not the Cubans who are notorious for killing wayward tourists.  You can probably guess which group preys upon visitors.</p>
