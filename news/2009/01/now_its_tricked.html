<h1><a href="https://radioequalizer.blogspot.com/2009/01/obamists-continue-to-reinvent-racist.html">Now, It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tricked Out&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Maloney, The Radio Equalizer, January 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To the long list of previously- mundane expressions now considered derogatory by the Obamist political faction, add &#8220;tricked out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes, according to close Barack friend and Massachusetts First Lady Diane Patrick, the use of &#8220;tricked out&#8221; to describe Governor Deval Patrick&rsquo;s publicly-funded Cadillac is &#8220;racist&#8221; because the term is apparently used to disparage black people.</p>
<p>Though Patrick aimed her tirade at the Boston Herald, it was one of several Boston-area news outlets that ridiculed the Bay State governor after trading in a more modest state vehicle for a brand new Caddy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diane Patrick&rsquo;s sentiments were revealed in a new book by far-left Obamist commentator Gwen Ifill, The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to reporter Hillary Chabot, Herald editors are standing by their previous coverage on the matter:<blockquote>It didn&rsquo;t have boom boxes, speakers on the outside, but they called it tricked-out,&#8221; Ifill quoted Patrick as saying.</p>
<p>Herald Editor Kevin Convey said the term &#8220;tricked out&#8221; had no racist implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re sorry that the first lady feels the way she does, but the term &lsquo;tricked out&rsquo; as a synonym for decorated or adorned is over 100 years old and has no racial connotation whatsoever. Moreover we meant none,&#8221; Convey said.</p>
<p>Gov. Patrick raised eyebrows when he switched his state car from a Crown Victoria to a Cadillac DTS and upgraded his office with $12,000 drapes and new sofas shortly after he took office in 2007. Patrick had also hired a $72,000 chief of staff for his wife.</p>
<p>Admitting he mistepped, Patrick later moved to pay for the Cadillac and the staffer stepped down.</blockquote>Convey couldn&rsquo;t be more on the mark here. In fact, the term &#8220;tricked out&#8221; has recently been used in this widely-viewed television commercial for Progressive Auto Insurance, a company run by one of Air America Radio&rsquo;s earliest financial backers:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve truly entered an era where any and all criticism of the Obamists can be labeled &#8220;racist&#8221;, with Barack &amp; Friends as the final arbiters of what is and what is not considered a slur.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t blacks originate the phrase &#8220;tricked out?&#8221;  Evidently, they now &#8220;own&#8221; this phrase (like they claim they own the n-word), so they can use it about themselves, but we can&rsquo;t use it about them.</p>

			<p>Don`t quote me on this but I do believe that &#8220;Tricked out&#8221; dates back a little further to White guys in shop class that drove `72 Plymouth Dusters&hellip;</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s been much reference on this forum regarding what some have pointed out is clear evidence that blacks are prone to arrogance far more than any other group.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s another example of that.  Whether its the dictator of Zimbabwe or a black governor of a state in the US, &#8220;strutting&#8221; his stuff seems to eventually expose the black male as wrapped up in his own feelings of self importance, even though he&rsquo;s only mediocre at best.</p>

			<p>Most governors get along with the dark blue Lincoln town cars provided for free by General Motors.  They are very elegant and conservative and look exactly the way a Mayor or Governors car should look.</p>

Will &#8216;pimped out&rsquo;, &#8216;bling&rsquo;, and &#8216;gehtto fabulous&rsquo; be next?</p>
<p>Blacks love to claim they add color to culture until their own words enter popular culture and reflect who they really are. Then their own words, the words they use to describe themselves, become &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>More proof that when it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win or break even. When dealing with blacks, it&rsquo;s lose-lose.</p>

Related to this  &mdash;   I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out if the Boston Herald is another leftie rag, or if it is more centrist like the New York Daily News.  Can any Boston people answer that?</p>
<p>Either way, she was showing the typical over-sensitivity that has become so common. </p>

			<p>Basically the thought police started with the notion whites can&rsquo;t say certain epithets that blacks pepper in their everyday speech, typically the variants of the N word, and are now taking that concept to the next level so that whites additionally can now not use benign black expressions like &#8220;tricked out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sooner or later one of us will be hauled before the tolerance inquisition for using the phrase &#8220;You go girl!&#8221; or &#8220;Oh No You DIDN&rsquo;T!&#8221; (which is often accompanied by a snap of the fingers and a bobbing back and forth of the head).</p>

			<p>The bottom line is anything that any White says or does, or doesn&rsquo;t say or do, is subject to being called racist.<br>

			<p>The irony is that the Obamist faction and its support of oppressive affirmative racism makes President BO&rsquo;s faction themselves &#8220;racist&#8221; as well as hypocritical</p>

			<p>So here we have more ghetto slang making its way into the white population and yet anotherexcuse for blacks to apply their tiresome double standard.</p>
<p>I for one am tired of hearing white people talk black, anyway. I point it out to my daughter every time and I take the trouble to explain to her that it degrades the language and with it the thought process. Even here on Amren some posters use such terms as &#8216;lily white&rsquo;, when they should damned well know that blacks use it against us as a term of disparagement, meaning weak and effeminate. I refuse to participate. Let them have their &#8220;tricked out&#8221; and all those other terms that can only come from the minds of low IQ people. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I think I recall that in Herman Melville&rsquo;s &#8220;Moby Dick&#8221; the Piquod is said to have been &#8220;tricked out&#8221; in whale invory.</p>
<p>I do believe it is an old &#8220;Yankee&#8221; phrase.</p>

			<p>I am just amazed that Obama sees the neccessity for a brand new ride on the taxpayer at a time when he is calling for austerity in government and throughout our lives.  To me, this is much akin to those auto execs who flew in to DC on private jets to beg for billions.</p>
<p>No one, not even Bill O&rsquo;Reilly has mentioned this (yet).</p>

			<p>Every time I become complacent about the depths our PC Thought Police-wannabees have plumbed, I am again suprised.</p>
<p>I can now safely predict a day when all words will be &#8220;racist&#8221;, and people - at least the right ones - will be expected to communicate with inarticulate animal cries and grunts.</p>
