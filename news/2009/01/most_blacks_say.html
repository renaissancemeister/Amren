<h1>Most Blacks Say MLK&rsquo;s Vision Fulfilled, Poll Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, Jan. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than two-thirds of African-Americans believe Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s vision for race relations has been fulfilled, a CNN poll found  &mdash;  a figure up sharply from a survey in early 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll found 69 percent of blacks said King&rsquo;s vision has been fulfilled in the more than 45 years since his 1963 &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech  &mdash;  roughly double the 34 percent who agreed with that assessment in a similar poll taken last March.</p>
<p>But whites remain less optimistic, the survey found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites don&rsquo;t feel the same way  &mdash;  a majority of them say that the country has not yet fulfilled King&rsquo;s vision,&#8221; CNN polling director Keating Holland said. However, the number of whites saying the dream has been fulfilled has also gone up since March, from 35 percent to 46 percent.</p>
<p>In the 1963 speech, delivered to a civil rights rally on the Mall in Washington, King said: &#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Has that dream been fulfilled? With the election of Barack Obama, two thirds of African-Americans believe it has,&#8221; CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In November, a majority of black respondents said that Obama&rsquo;s victory signaled a new era in race relations. The poll suggests that a majority today no longer feels that way, although most blacks predict some improvement on racial issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the immediate aftermath of Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory in November, African-Americans were cautiously optimistic about the future of race relations in the U.S., but some of that optimism has faded since that time,&#8221; Holland added.</p>
<p>In November, a majority of blacks for the first time believed that the U.S. would eventually find a solution to its racial problems; now a majority of blacks believe that race relations will always be a problem in this country. Blacks do believe that the Obama presidency will be good for them  &mdash;  61 percent say that the quality of life for African-Americans will improve over the next four years. Optimism for a new era has also dropped among whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a burst of enthusiasm about race relations immediately after Obama&rsquo;s election. The initial excitement has cooled a bit. But most blacks and whites still foresee some improvement in race relations,&#8221; Schneider said.</p>

<p>The susceptible nature of Blacks is an important part the relationship between (a) the most greedy, opportunistic Whites, (b) the most yielding, giving, altruistic Whites, (c) the traditional Conservative White taxpayer, and (d) Blacks.</p>
<p>a - middle men<br>
b - avid givers (Liberals)<br>
c - coerced givers (Conservatives)<br>
d - takers</p>
<p>Without b, c, and d, the flow of money through the middle men, a, is stiffled. The middle men, a, play all sides against each other.</p>

			<p>Most whites don&rsquo;t see it. That&rsquo;s because most whites aren&rsquo;t really concerned about hypothetical people in Africa, Bosnia, or even Comption. Nothing to do with them. The mission wont be fulfilled until they&rsquo;ve made every last &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; person they meet suffer properly for real in person. </p>

			<p>The sickening thing about black attitude that is prevalent right now and will deterioate even further in the coming months is that they have the unmitigated gall to claim that there are any kind of attitudes or forces at play against them, besides their own lack of intelligence and abilities, that determine whether or not they will succeed.</p>
<p>Too, why do the white disgusting liberals always insist on comparing black intlligence and achievement with whites, rather than comparing them to mestizos and all the other groups in the US, because they lag behind them as well, and the constitute about 60 million people, far more than the population of blacks.</p>
<p>Why are the other groups ignored completely, with only blacks the main topic of conversation, when achievement gaps are discussed?</p>
<p>Conservative talk show hosts could turn this discussion away from a black/white one into an area where it really belongs, which is the non-white population.  Let the liberal panty waists compare the Asian/black, mestizo/black gaps instead of including whites into a discussion, since they will be a minority in the schools very soon.</p>

<p>This is the phenomenon called &#8216;White guilt&rsquo;, which is fostered by the media.  Imagine they (Blacks) feel that King&rsquo;s &#8216;Dream&rsquo; had been fulfilled (2/3&rsquo;s) and more White&rsquo;s that not don&rsquo;t think so.  It&rsquo;s like, &#8216;We haven&rsquo;t licked enough boots yet; Not enough White women have been raped; not enough White people have been murdered by Black thugs; not enough Whites have been driven out of their neighborhoods, etc.  We still have a long way to go folks.</p>

The blacks got everything handed to them, and we foot the bill and still they whine&hellip;it&rsquo;s in their nature to complain, whine and rip us off.  The stupid white liberals are to blame, had the whites stuck together none of the nonesense we are facing now, would NOT exist.  mlk was the phoney of the 20th century and now BHO will be the phoniest of the 21st century.

			<p>Could it be that Blacks imagine that MLK&rsquo;s &#8220;vision&#8221; has been fulfilled because they also imagine that the only thing holding them back was having Whites in charge?  Now that a Black man is &#8220;running the country&#8221;, will all the good things in life fall into their hands?  </p>

			<p>Whites do not find MLK&rsquo;s vision fulfilled because we are now judged for the color of our skin and, as our multicultural society fails (can anyone think of a single historical example of a successful multicultural society?) further, we are blamed for every ill when the bottom line is that multicultural/pluralistic societies cannot set goals and so degenerate into third world chaos.</p>

			<p>Why is it that the bulk of (ignorant) citizens seem to venerate those who are often amoral?  When I read of MLKs&rsquo; adulteries and palgiarisms thsu showing he was anything but a man of religion and a good family man, many whites are silly enough to think he was a good man, just as they do Nelson mandela who even when in jail was a self-admitted terrorist who approved the murders of women and children with bombs in shopping malls etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps a book written by a leading author, with checkable cross-references of te facts is overdue to expose MLK for what he really was.  </p>
<p>I am alos worried about Pres elecet Obama for the Uk has just got rid ofa such a clone who was a good talker but has ledBritain into financial and political correctness disaster.   Also, many of te streets are now dangerous to walk with the feral gangs that have sprung up who carry knives and guns.  Most of the stabbing victims are blacks according to national Press photos (although often these are witheld to stop the &#8220;race casting&#8221;)and the perps are often of a similar race, but now many white and Asian youths are also carrying weapons for self-protection thus making the situation far worse.   We hear &amp; read that ordinary folk, even old people in their 70s plus, dare not even look at some of the thugs in the streets and on public transport for fear of giving them an excuse to attack you with serious injuries or even death as a result.  Time perhaps for a &#8220;Charles Bronson movie&#8221; scenario in Britain?   Thank God I do not live in the land of my birth anymore.</p>

<p>The only concrete fantasy that Marty King might have entertained is above? Since Affirmative Racism still reigns, and signs indicate that it will never cease, how can anyone seriously believe the &#8220;dream&#8221; is realized?</p>

			<p>I guess the question of whether the Saint&rsquo;s &#8220;dream&#8221; has been fullfilled depends on what his dream actually was. If he wanted blacks to be judged by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, then his dream has been a complete failure, mostly because blacks themselves aren&rsquo;t interested in competing in a meritocracy. They want affirmative action based on skin color. They see everything in terms of skin color. As for whites, they&rsquo;ve been falling all over themselves for years to deny the truth about the black character. We&rsquo;ve had fifty years to &#8220;judge them on the content of their character,&#8221; but the reality just hasn&rsquo;t sunk in. So if &#8220;character not skin color&#8221; was King&rsquo;s dream, then it&rsquo;s been a failure, a predictable failure and will always be a failure. On the other hand, if his dream was to force integration down our throats and wreck our schools and cities, then it&rsquo;s been a big success. </p>

<p>WLS-AM radio host Roe Conn was talking about the public schools a couple of months back and a Chicago area teacher called in. She mentioned the IQ of the students as one of the problems and Roe Conn said: &#8220;DON&rsquo;T GO THERE.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proof the Liberals KNOW the truth and strive to suppress it.</p>

			<p>Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s dream was for a man to be judged not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character.  But all that anyone can think whenever they see Barack Obama is that he&rsquo;s black, or the first black president in American history.  No one thinks about his policies, and I would challenge any black supporter of his to name those policies.</p>
<p>The Harlem Globetrotters are all wearing number 44 today to honor him.  BET devoted most of their programming yesterday to Barack Obama.  And King&rsquo;s dream is realized?  He&rsquo;s just a black man to these people.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I don&rsquo;t believe that Whites are the most intelligent people on earth.  Sure we have made plenty of advancements for the world be we are not smart enough to keep our own country.  We should all go back to Europe and keep them out of our continent.</p>

			<p>No the dream has not been met! Dr. King asked for black people to be accepted into society without any acknowledgement of color or race. If his dream had been met, then we would not be hearing the constant African-American comments; the first &#8220;black&#8221; president comments; or stories how &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;African-American&#8221; people feel, or think or this or that!  Today all we would have heard was that President Obama was sworn in, nothing else!</p>

<p>Sounds like a good plan for people like you. You and others like you would be doing this country a favor by depopulating it. You talk as if that is actuallly going to happen. No matter what the ratio of the world is, the white man will always rule it. IT&rsquo;S DESTINY.</p>
<p>But you still have a black man as your president or at least until move to another country.</p>

			<p>No one who calls himself an &#8220;African-American&#8221; will ever be considered to be an American at all (as Teddy Roosevelt pointed out) and he has no place in the White House.  Obama will never measure up to the stature of a man like Teddy Roosevelt. </p>
<p>  https://home.comcast.net/~nhprman/trhyphenated.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all.&#8221;  Former President Theodore Roosevelt, October 12, 1915, in an address to the Knights of Columbus, Carnegie Hall, NYC.<br>
