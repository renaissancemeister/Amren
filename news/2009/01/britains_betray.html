			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), January 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White families on the country&rsquo;s poorest estates believe they have been &lsquo;betrayed&rsquo; and &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo; by politicians who favour newly-arrived immigrants, a Government report acknowledged today.</p>
<p>It found that people on council estates think they always come second to immigrants for housing and benefits.</p>
<p>Many feel they have been shoved aside by politicians who use political correctness and allegations of racism to stifle honest discussion, it said.</p>
<p>The report for the Department of Communities and Local Government drew an admission from Communities Secretary Hazel Blears that white working class people &lsquo;sometimes just don&rsquo;t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said people should be allowed to talk about their worries &lsquo;without fear of being branded a racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The findings, produced by Mrs Blear&rsquo;s &lsquo;National Community Forum&rsquo;, appear another step on Labour&rsquo;s road away from multiculturalism, the left-wing doctrine that dominated ministerial thinking until the 2005 London July bombings.</p>
<p>Under multiculturalism, ethnic minority groups are encouraged to develop their own identity while critics say values associated with white groups are dismissed as racist.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report was based on interviews with 43 people on largely-white housing estates in Birmingham, Runcorn, Milton Keynes and Thetford in Norfolk.</p>
<p>It found that &lsquo;by far the most frequent context for referring to ethnic minorities is that of perceived competition for resources &mdash; typically housing, but also employment, benefits, territory and culture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the Milton Keynes estate, &lsquo;feelings of anxiety around housing were so acute that respondents claimed they had voted against the regeneration of the estate, which meant pulling down all breeze block houses and rebuilding them with new and better materials, because they feared that their necessary displacement during building work would result in them losing their places on the estate to immigrants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many residents were worried that refugees and single mothers could find council and housing association homes more easily than people whose families had lived in the area for generations.</p>
<p>It said they felt that if they complained they would be told the system was fair and they were racist.</p>
<p>The report said there was a &lsquo;growing sense of unfairness and disempowerment among poor white people&rsquo; that was at its deepest in the most deprived areas.</p>
<p>It warned that the resentment could provide fertile ground for far right political groups.</p>
<p>The NCM report dismissed the idea that concerns about political correctness were genuine. The reason people spoke of political correctness, it said, was &lsquo;so that the white majority assume the role of victims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Its authors also considered that despite the lack of &lsquo;explicitly hostile language&rsquo; from white interviewees, &lsquo;this is still about race&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But Mrs Blears was more sympathetic to those who fear their interests are ignored.</p>
<p>She said that people were expressing &lsquo;real complexities&rsquo; and that the Government would look closely at their concerns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;White working class people living on estates sometimes just don&rsquo;t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them,&rsquo; Mrs Blears said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whilst they might not be experiencing the direct impact of migration, their fear of it is acute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Changes in communities can generate unease and uncertainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These changes need to be explained and questions need to be answered or the myths that currently surround the treatment of ethnic minorities &#8220;jumping the queue&#8221; will become increasingly hard to shift.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People who care about their communities and have lived there for generations have every right to ask questions about what is happening in their estate, street, neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour MP Frank Field, co-chairman of the cross-party group on balanced migration, said the Government should start to answer working class concerns.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Hazel Blears says that people on council estates feel ignored. That is exactly our point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not only on council estates &mdash; 80 per cent of the public want to see a substantial reduction in immigration but the Government refuses to address the issue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder people feel the Government is riding roughshod over their wishes, and not only in the poorest areas, which are bearing the brunt of the present massive level of immigration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless further action is taken soon, immigration will add nearly 10 million to the population of England in the next 20 years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Field added: &lsquo;If Labour wants to influence the outcome of the next General Election, it had better start addressing white working class concern about immigration, not simply reporting on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tory cohesion spokesman Baroness Warsi said: &lsquo;What an indictment of New Labour that they have to have an investigation to show that over the last 10 years they have completely lost touch with their so-called roots.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst other things this has also demonstrated the dangers of Labour&rsquo;s past use of identity politics for electoral purposes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This should be a call to focus on the real core problems of worklessness, debt, welfare dependency, family breakdown and drug and alcohol abuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The allocation of council and housing association homes has become an increasingly difficult problem for Labour MPs and ministers in recent years, particularly in high migration areas.</p>
<p>Former Culture Minister Margaret Hodge complained last year that in her East London constituency migrant families were being given priority for homes over those with a &lsquo;legitimate sense of entitlement&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Waiting lists for social housing have nearly doubled since Labour came to power and are getting longer thanks to the economic crisis. There are currently around 1.7 million people on the waiting lists.</p>
<p>Homes are handed out on the basis of &lsquo;need&rsquo; as assessed by officials. This means that single parents and people who can show they are homeless or workless often get priority over those with jobs and longstanding local connections.</p>
<p>Around one in 12 council or housing association properties &mdash; more than 300,000 homes &mdash; are occupied by people who are foreign citizens.<br>

			<p>This reminds me of Mao&rsquo;s &#8220;Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom&#8221; promise in the 60&rsquo;s.  After 20 years of famine, gulags and 100 million deaths there was dissent in China.  So Mao decreed that dissent would be allowed and different points of view other than his own expressed.</p>
<p>So many expressed their concerns about Mao&rsquo;s regime. Mao&rsquo;s operatives took names.  A couple years later Mao&rsquo;s Red Brigades of psychopathic young people murdered every dissedent who participated in the Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom discussions of how to improve life in Chine.</p>
<p>The Cross Party Group on Balanced Immigration will probably hunt down and imprison any Brit who expresses anything but enthusiasm for the destruction of Britian and its indigneous white people.</p>
<p>If the labor party wants to know what the people of Britian thinks of their immigration policy all they have to do is ask the BNP.</p>
<p>Is there an election coming up?  Must be for Labour to even mention that immigration is not the greatest thing since the resurrection.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Homes are handed out on the basis of &lsquo;need&rsquo; as assessed by officials. This means that single parents and people who can show they are homeless or workless often get priority over those with jobs and longstanding local connections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brand new immigrants who have just arrived in the country and don&rsquo;t yet have their status regularized play the homeless scam to get council housing.  Indians and Pakistanis are expert at this.  The family arrives at the airport and is picked up by relatives already living in Britian.  Next morning they go to the local housing office claiming to be homeless.  If they have a lot of children and claim some sort of handicap they are settled within a few days in a nice council house.</p>
<p>Otherwise it might take a week or 2.</p>
<p>Of course they are not homeless, they are staying with relatives in a nice council house not nearly as crowded as a middle class house in India or a hovel in Pakistan.</p>
<p>So the native British already on the housing list are pushed back by these fraudlent &#8220;homeless&#8221; new arrivals. The native British can be on the waiting list for 10 or more years while newly arrived Hindus and Muslims wait less than 10 days after arrival in the country.</p>
<p>Since affirmative action has created local council offices staffed mostly with non British immigrants, the scam will continue until the former British working class are mostly homeless beggars.</p>
<p>Britian needs to tax the rich multiculturalists to pay for the council housing for immigrants.  Maybe a new tax schedule; no one earning less than 40,000 pounds per year pays any income tax. Those earning more than 40,000 pounds per year (basically well educated rich liberals) pay increased taxes to support all their beloved minorities on life long benefit.</p>

			<p>I have commented before that the only way out for the English is to get rid of both the Labout &amp; Conservative parties by voting for the British National Party.</p>
<p>Neither Labour nor the Conservatives will change their agendas.</p>
<p>Give the BNP two terms in office with a good majority &amp; they will be able to put the country back on track and most importantly set themselves free of the communist EU.</p>

			<p>So, the aristos are getting a little worried that the peasants know the score, what?  Perhaps they should slow down the rate of displacement, so as not to provoke the masses.  Can&rsquo;t have the true Britons rioting as if they were Moslems or Blacks or something, can we?    </p>

<p>However I am encouraged by the fact that the white Brits that feel unfairly discriminated against, just might join the BNP! </p>

			<p>One very frightening statistic that is completely ignored by Britain&rsquo;s politicians and media is the fact that the number of households projected to be on the waiting list for public housing will soar past 5 million in a few years time.<br>
Considering that there are only around 20 million households in Britain this is a most alarming prospect</p>
<p> - (It is exceedingly likely that the imbalance caused by Britain&rsquo;s chronic accomodation shortage is at the root of its current economic catastrophe - only Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;clever&rsquo; politicians and economists for some reason can&rsquo;t see this, if there was no immigration into Britain there would be no housing crisis, since the indigenous population has declined every year since 1976 - FACT).<br>

			<p>The British, and their American cousins, are notorious for being generous whenever there is plenty for everyone. That generous heart begins to fail when there is not enough for everyone and public policy takes from citizens what they need and awards it instead to foreign citizens.</p>
<p>The obvious solution to restore the generous spirit is simply to have enough to go around. Unfortunately, economic reality and physical limitations are not easily overlooked for long. Our hospitality is simply not sustainable in the long term.<br>

<p>The Daily Mail is a very working-class tabloid that (supposedly) caters to &#8220;conservative&#8221; Brits   &mdash;   and politically it tends to lean toward the Conservative Party. It certainly isn&rsquo;t Left like The Guardian or even The Times. But just like them, the Daily Mail persists in treating the British National Party as a boogeyman that may be brought up only to be denounced. Despite the fact that all these white working-class concerns that Hazel Blears and NuLabour are FINALLY waking up to have been concerns of the BNP for YEARS AND YEARS, the Daily Mail refuses to say ANYTHING good about Nick Griffin and his remarkable organization. </p>
<p>The BNP have the best, most sensible solutions to every single problem mentioned in this article   &mdash;   yet even a &#8220;right-wing&#8221; tabloid like the Mail can&rsquo;t bring themselves to mention their name without spitting. </p>
<p>But the UK MSM can&rsquo;t keep up this charade forever   &mdash;   especially as NuLabour is scheduled to be GONE as of next year. </p>

			<p>Notice who the Tory &#8216;cohesion spokesperson&rsquo; is? One Baroness Warsi, no less. The Tories are determined to made inroads into what the unrepentant vulgarly call &#8220;the wog vote,&#8221; rather than to stick up for the interests of the majority population of Britain. Hence the rapid en-noblement and rapid rise to prominence of the self-assured Baroness.</p>
<p>The S.S.Windrush brought the first significant boatload of permanent immigrants from the West Indies to Britain in the late 1940s, during the the period in office of Clement Attlee&rsquo;s Labour government. However, the true foundation years of mass Commonwealth immigration were the Tory years of 1951-1964 under Churchill, Eden, MacMillan and Lord Home.</p>
<p>Back in the fifties the Mosleyites banged on about the dangers posed by mass immigration but almost nobody listened; Sir Oswald Mosley was regarded as a crank tainted by his prewar adulation of Hitler and his wartime internment. </p>
<p>As for the Conservative Party leadership, despite their very reluctant and half-hearted posturings these days, during the years when they were in government the Tories simply adored the mass influx of cheap labour, which greatly benefited their supporters and contributors in the business community. The cotton towns of Lancashire and the wool towns of Yorkshire witnessed immigration on a colossal scale; the mills ran for another generation before finally faltering and closing. The mills are a thing of the past now but disgruntled and bitter  Asian Muslim communities remain; it was from their second and third generations that the London suicide bombers were recruited. </p>
<p>An anecdote, possibly apocryphal: A rank-and-file Conservative briefly cornered the Tory grandee Duncan Sandys at a Conservative Party Conference, demanding to know why on earth the government was permitting, and indeed even encouraging, such massive immigration by people who were alien in every way. </p>
<p>Duncan Sandys is said to have regarded the man with patrician contempt and replied:  &#8220;Well, there&rsquo;s a labour shortage.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Precisely! In the eyes of Sandys and, at that time, Enoch Powell, the short-term interests of the capitalist class were of far more importance than the long-term interests of ordinary Britons.</p>
<p>The Labour Party was impaled on a spike. Working-class Labour Party members were fully aware that the interests of ordinary folk were damaged by mass Third World immigration yet the Labour Party had a sentimental attachment to the &#8220;All Men are Brothers, All Women are Sisters&#8221; ideology of the Second International.</p>

			<p>New Labour has stabbed the English working class in the back.<br>
The only (forlorn) hope is that the English working class has the courage and shrwedness to transfer en masse their political allegiance to the BNP (a party which actually has policies congenial to working class interests), from their traditional allegiance to Labour (which by and large hates and despises them), and make sure they vote heavily, loyally and consistently at every possible election, local, council and general.<br>
  In a &#8216;first-past-the-post&rsquo; political duopoly as exists in Brtiain it is very difficult for small parties to gain traction, but the shining example is the political rise of Keir Hardie&rsquo;s Independent Labour Party (oh how he would have hated Tony Blair!) from 1880 to 1918, a party that came from nowhere but effectively replaced the Liberals as Britain&rsquo;s second party.<br>
  It can be done.</p>

			<p>There is no doubt non-whites are treated better In fact the Government bends over backwards to appease them. And goes out of their way to crucify whites for the slightest perceived infractions against the immigrant community. It&rsquo;s easy to see why white Brits are leaving the UK in droves.</p>

			<p>Unconditional universal altruism is the expressway to the poorhouse. On the contrary, reciprocal <i>restricted</i> altruism strengthens other existing social bonds, beside being itself a social bond.</p>
<p>The Labour party is the AIDS virus of the British Body Politic, and the non-economic cultural changes which came in its baggage can be compared to the opportunistic illnesses which follow in the virus&rsquo; wake. However, <i>short</i>-term tunnel-vision monomaniacal <i>economo</i>-mania, a quintessentially <i>bourgeois</i> characteristic, gives birth to phenomena like the apocryphal Sandys anecdote cited in the article. </p>
<p>Finally, the best of reasons for antipathy to empire, is backwash of migration of colonial natives to the metropolis. No overseas possessions - populated by a different ethny than that of one&rsquo;s own country - means fewer portals of entry; where a colonial native can present a moral claim difficult to refute.</p>

			<p>All of this was anticipated and planned for.</p>
<p>It is not a secret that NONE of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; arrived in the UK with their own home in their luggage or on their back. EVERY single one of them required housing. Very little was done to expand the existing stock of housing and almost none of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; had building trades skills.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means housing is going to get crowded. It also means that the native Brits are not leaving the country fast enough to solve the housing shortage. Much of the housing being provided to &#8220;immigrants&#8221; is the housing vacated by Brits leaving the UK for other countries.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? DO MORE to encourage native Brits to leave the country, so there will be more housing for the foreigners. Maybe the government could use the Royal Navy to transport the remaining native Brits to the former Colonies. That is where their other kinsmen live. Isn&rsquo;t this all about &#8220;family reunification&#8221;?<br>

			<p>I lived in central London for several years, mixed with a wide variety of folk, and I can tell you plainly that the question is not &#8220;Which foreigners are trying to cheat the system?&#8221; but &#8220;Which foreigners AREN&rsquo;T trying to cheat the system?&#8221; And they do get priority over white Britons. Not only that, but since the arrival of large numbers of Nigerians and other Africans into the London local government bureaucracy, many council houses and flats are now awarded upon the paying of bribes to well-placed officials. </p>

			<p>Labour&rsquo;s immigration policy turns out to have been a very effective campaign tactic in the class war – only with the twist that, in this case, Labour has been on the side of the haves rather than the have-nots. </p>
<p>The wonderful thing about dramatically increasing immigration in the way Labour has done over the past decade is that advocates of that policy can present it to themselves not as a way of forcing down the wages of the poorest Britons to the great advantage of the employing classes, but as an altruistic attempt to help the impoverished of the developing world. They see it as an exercise in compassion and social justice. </p>

			<p>As a white working class man coming to the end of my working life. (I am 63yrs of age) I despair at the lack of employment opportunities for the young working class. <br>
Manufacturing has virtually dissappeared, and I dont only blame this Labour Government but the Tories as well in the previous 18 yrs. <br>
The Labour party in allowing unrestricted immigration has deliberately depressed wages especially in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. <br>
In my opinion this low wage strategy has in part been responsible for the economic demise of the working class. <br>
Working class families are now realising that it is impossible to get on the privately owned housing ladder, but are unable to obtain social housing. </p>
<p>Thus facing a double whammy, as the very people who have depressed their wages have invariably accessed the social housing that would traditionally been offered to them. <br>
Is it any wonder that working class families are feeling disillusioned with the Labour Party. </p>
<p>For Labour to have even the slightest chance of being re elected they must listen to the people they profess to represent. Restrict immigration and treat the working class with respect, and return to working class values. They must abandon the Guardianista ideaology they have pursued for the last 11 years <br>

			<p>English and working class, living in a poor area I am beneath the contempt of nearly every politician. I have come to realize that my sole purpose in life is to pay taxes to provide benefits to immigrants when i am entitled to nothing because I am self employed. No wonder the English have given up on having kids - we have no future.<br>

If anyone thinks that only the working classes are affected by mass immigration they are mistaken. </p>
<p>The changes taking place in Britain are profound, permanent and will affect every class. </p>
<p>The wellbeing of any nation depends on the average capability and outlook of the population as a whole. Britain is becoming South Asianised, Africanised and Islamified. </p>
<p>Our ruling classes, obsessed with the dogma of anti-racism, seem not to have realised that Pakistan is like Pakistan because it is populated by Pakistanis or that Zimbabwe is like Zimbabwe because it is populated by Zimbabweans. They seem not to know that a future England will reflect its population as it exists then. </p>
<p>And that alarms all sensible people � not just the working classes. Our rulers will never admit their mistake but even if they did, what can they do now. </p>
<p>Asian and other influences are so powerful in this country that the opinions of English people no longer count for much in England. The new populations with all their ways and cultures so different to ours will not allow curbs on the immigration of their brethren. Why would they. Every new immigrant will further boost the power and influence of their kind. </p>
<p>The future for England is to be a cross between India (with its constant war with Islam) and say Nigeria at best; or just as likely, a cross between Pakistan and Zimbabwe. That is why ever-increasing numbers of English people of all classes are emigrating as fast as they can. The more coming in - the more go out. The vicious or virtuous circle (depending on your view) is now unstoppable. </p>
<p>The Labour party with its obsession with high taxes; 83 percent rising to 98 percent (repeat 98 percent) and unlimited powers to the Trade Unions destroyed British industry and now they have surpassed themselves. They are first political party in history to have destroyed a nation. </p>

			<p>Brand new immigrants who have just arrived in the country and don&rsquo;t yet have their status regularized play the homeless scam to get council housing. Indians and Pakistanis are expert at this. The family arrives at the airport and is picked up by relatives already living in Britian. Next morning they go to the local housing office claiming to be homeless. If they have a lot of children and claim some sort of handicap they are settled within a few days in a nice council house.</p>
<p>Otherwise it might take a week or 2.</p>
<p>Of course they are not homeless, they are staying with relatives in a nice council house not nearly as crowded as a middle class house in India or a hovel in Pakistan.</p>
<p>So the native British already on the housing list are pushed back by these fraudlent &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; new arrivals. The native British can be on the waiting list for 10 or more years while newly arrived Hindus and Muslims wait less than 10 days after arrival in the country.</p>
<p>Since affirmative action has created local council offices staffed mostly with non British immigrants, the scam will continue until the former British working class are mostly homeless beggars.<br>
