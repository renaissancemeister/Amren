<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the first African-American president in United States history takes office, researchers have shown that it may be possible to scientifically reduce racial bias.</p>
<p>After being trained to distinguish between similar black male faces, Caucasian test subjects showed greater racial tolerance on a test designed to to measure unconscious bias.</p>
<p>The results are still preliminary, have yet to be replicated, and the real-world effects of reducing bias in a controlled laboratory setting are not clear. But for all those caveats, the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that science can battle racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tarr&rsquo;s findings overlap with other results suggesting that the key to reducing racial bias  &mdash;  at least in a short-term, laboratory setting  &mdash;  is exposure to people in personalized ways that challenge stereotypes. {snip}</p>
<p>But unlike carefully structured social mixing, with precisely controlled conditions of interdependence and equality, Tarr and others raise the possibility of a lab-based shortcut to bias reduction.</p>
<p>Underpinning this research is the Implicit Association Test, used by psychologists to measure deep-rooted, often unconscious biases. During the test, subjects are measured on the time it takes to associate faces with positive or negative words. If, for example, someone more quickly associates negative words with minority rather than white faces, they&rsquo;re likely to have a bias  &mdash;  a bias that translates into a tendency to hire same-race workers, choose same-race partners, and find minority defendants guilty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s remarkable that our brain is so flexible that 10 hours of training will affect something that is the product of your whole life experience,&#8221; said Tarr, who hopes his work will lead to race training for people working in potentially race-sensitive situations, such as police officers, social workers and immigration officials.</p>
<p>In a study published Tuesday in Public Library of Science ONE, Tarr&rsquo;s team put 20 Caucasian college students through ten hours of face-identification training, testing their ability to discern previously-seen from unknown faces. Students with the largest improvements in face memory also showed significant improvements on a variation of the Implicit Association Test.</p>
<p>According to Banaji, a brief talk about working for women suffices to reduce gender bias. City University of New York psychologist Curtis Hardin showed that having black experimenters administer a test produced lower bias scores among white subjects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For at least the next four years, however, the United States will collectively undergo a real-world experiment in stereotype defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first black president  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s going to have a huge effect on things that come to mind,&#8221; said Ohio State University psychologist Richard Petty. &#8220;Instead of just negative associations, there will be all sorts of positive associations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe in fairies. I do believe in fairies. I do believe in fairies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Being around blacks in a fatiguing, soul-draining chore.</p>
<p>There are many &#8216;caveats&rsquo; involved in dealing with blacks. You have to question your every word and action so as not to set them off. Then there are those who are looking to set you off by being in-your-face rude and pushy. They want you to lose it so they can scream &#8216;I&rsquo;m a victim of racism&rsquo;. (Recently, a friend was at work in a retail store. A black woman spent a good deal of time asking different workers questions. Before she left, she asked to speak to the manager. After talking to as many employees as she could, she singled out one guy for being rude to her and said he was a racist. She was looking to tar and feather at least one employee of the store as a racist and she found her victim).</p>
<p>Regardless of what ideal conditions can be created in the lab, they can not be expected to be reproduced in the real world.</p>
<p>The only people who harbor no racial opinions towards blacks are the ones who have no or limited contact. Whites don&rsquo;t flee their white neighborhoods when whites arrive. They flee when they see and experience average blacks as they are.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s remarkable that our brain is so flexible that 10 hours of training will affect something that is the product of your whole life experience&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Total bunk. What white people learn is how to watch their words and spout the required and appropriate platitudes. Nothing more. This isn&rsquo;t even brainwashing. It&rsquo;s learning to play by imposed rules.</p>

			<p>Perhaps whites will be rounded up and subjected to forced lobotomies.  Washington will have racism surgically removed from the brains of whites and reduce them to zombies who question nothing.  The majority of whites would not resist.  </p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s agenda is to eviscerate our white middle class by exporting our jobs overseas and by replacing us here at home with imported alien labor.  Deposed middle class whites won&rsquo;t have a chance of finding lower class jobs either, since these are already taken by Hispanic illegals.  </p>
<p>This treachery is intended to reduce our once independent and self sustaining white middle class to groveling social parasites who will be made wards of the state; a state headed by a mentally ill racist black with a Messiah complex&hellip;</p>

			<p>Note to researchers:</p>
<p><br>
Racism is NOT a disease; it is the result of the collective behaviour of a homogenous group of people of the same race (ie blacks, mestizos, chinese, whites, etc.) After years of living close to each other, different races tend to dislike each other.<br>
Mutual dislike is NOT a disease. What is truly diseased is the liberal/radical thinking that insists upon no race differences, and that we have to love and tolerate each other no matter what.</p>
<p>There is a true disease for you; cure that!</p>

<p><p>Oh, really?  You mean in the next four years blacks are going to stop disrupting schools, stop committing violent crime at rates far above other groups, stop blighting their neighborhoods, stop utilizing welfare at higher rates than other groups, and stop obsessing about alleged &#8220;racism&#8221; as the cause of all their troubles?<p>I didn&rsquo;t think so&hellip;<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got news for these &#8220;researchers&#8221;: you&rsquo;re not getting rid of &#8220;bias&#8221; against blacks by these word and image games in a laboratory.  You&rsquo;ll get rid of it when it is the norm for blacks in general to be the law-abiding, striving, no-jiving achiever that Barack Obama seems to be.</p></p></p></p>

			<p>What stuck out most of all regarding the was the cure was directed at white people. I read some of the blogging which is usually all liberal bent. Surprisingly, there were other comments asking the same question I had. Where is the cure for all the black racism?</p>

			<p>These experiments sound invalid to me.  The subjects know what the &#8220;correct&#8221; response is, and I suppose that many of them have already been conditioned to see their own healthy racial feelings as something shameful.  All the incentives push people toward suppressing their instincts, which allows the psychologists to claim that they&rsquo;ve effected a &#8220;cure&#8221;.  <br>
     It strikes me that an effort is being made to produce a massive case of &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome&#8221; in the nation.  For those who don&rsquo;t recall, the Stockholm Syndrome was named after a hostage taking in Sweden, where the captives came to identify with their captors.  Some of them testified in defense of the criminals at their trial, and I seem to recall that one woman even married one of the brutes.  That sounds a lot like the Obamaphiles.  <br>
     Still, any effect on healthy Whites will be superficial.  A lifetime of social conditioning overthrown in ten hours?  That sounds like one of those theraputic cults of the 70s, like EST or Lifespring, A Weekend That Will Change Your Life Forever, for only $350.  It seems the typical psychologist has all the integrity of a Black preacher.  </p>

			<p>With direct electrostimulation of the brain (i.e. implanted electrodes), maybe a little scopolamine, far better and quicker results in behaviour modification can be achieved. As the pioneering work was done in the Fatherland of the working class long ago, I am somewhat surprised that this has not already been mandatory for quite some time, at least for those with white sex partners.<br>
(with a new kind of president, expect field trials to start in a year or so)</p>
<p>The whole &#8220;racism&#8221; racket is becoming both ridiculous and scary - like nothing else but the Inquisition and the witch hunts.</p>

			<p>I am so glad AR selected to run this piece of utter trash:</p>
<p>&#8220;Underpinning this research is the Implicit Association Test, used by psychologists to measure deep-rooted, often unconscious biases. During the test, subjects are measured on the time it takes to associate faces with positive or negative words. If, for example, someone more quickly associates negative words with minority rather than white faces, they&rsquo;re likely to have a bias &mdash; a bias that translates into a tendency to hire same-race workers, choose same-race partners, and find minority defendants guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is what it all comes down to?</p>
<p>The so-called, &#8220;Implicit Association Test?&#8221;</p>
<p>Give me a break!</p>
<p>Let us dissect this garbage, word for word.</p>
<p>I &#8220;choose same-race partners,&#8221; out of loyalty and kinship, not &#8220;racism?&#8221;</p>
<p>1.) Well, that is where it all starts, isn&rsquo;t it? I am not going to marry a cheetah or baboon, so I must be an evil white &#8220;racist?&#8221; Enough said!</p>
<p>2.) I hire a white man, to do a white man&rsquo;s job, not an &#8220;undocumented migrants,&#8221; what is wrong with that? Oh, I know, it isn&rsquo;t in the manefestos of the SPLC or La Raza. God just please &#8220;forgive&#8221; me for that!</p>
<p>3.)Finding minority &#8220;defendants&#8221; guilty more often then not? What was, &#8220;The Color of Crime&rsquo;s&#8221; point? Need I ask more?</p>
<p>As always, God Help Us All!!!</p>

			<p>This is reminiscent of the Soviet Union where if one&rsquo;s political/social thinking wasn&rsquo;t in line with the almighty State&rsquo;s guidelines, one would be sent to a psychiatric hospital for &#8220;psychological correction.&#8221;  </p>
<p>How long do you think it will be before it will be necessary to undergo this form of brainwashing before you can get a measly job in THIS &#8220;free country?&#8221;  Today sensitivity training, tomorrow forced psychological correction in the workplace like some bloody lab rat.</p>

			<p>I agree with all of your comments on here. Maybe &#8220;racism&#8221; is not the ultimate in all evils; maybe being racist is not the worst thing a person can be. I am a firm believer in the biological reasons in our history/evolution that manifest themselves in the psyche and predispositions of the human mind. For example, our reaction when we are confronted with public speaking is the same reaction a primate has when it senses it is being stalked by a predator. Likewise, our natural desire to &#8220;flock together&#8221; is not inherently evil, it is a byproduct of hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Obviously since our species is still here, and doing quite well I might add, this biological desire can&rsquo;t possibly be &#8220;evil.&#8221; You can&rsquo;t assign moral values to instincts, which is just what the leftist ultralibs and feel-good MSM want us to believe. If you put a shih tsu in a room with another shih tsu and a boxer, see who it goes after.</p>

			<p>More and more I am thinking that the outcome of this sort of research is not to &#8216;cure&rsquo; whites from pre-judging non-whites.<br>
But to keep us divided as a people by keeping us busy fighting each other.<br>
Out of fear of what we can achieve when united.<br>
Perhaps scared that the atrocities of WW2 may reoccur or something else just as silly.</p>

			<p>Unbelievable! You know, during the run-up to the election, every news organization talked non-stop about race and what effect it would have on the outcome. NPR was literally looking under rocks in the Ozarks for White people who would say what they wanted us to hear: There are Whites in the US that won&rsquo;t vote for a black man for President. We were beaten over the head for weeks with stories like this and commentaries from blacks and guilt-tripped whites warning us about changing our evil racist ways. <br>
Obama won&hellip;so now we need to bring science into the mix to keep the &#8220;evil white racist&#8221; mentality alive. Perhaps the real solution to this issue is for the President to simply mandate that every White family in America be assigned a black housemate. Wouldn&rsquo;t that help us overcome our racist tendencies?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; is merely an extension of the survival instinct.  We have a few bad experiences with people (or anything previously unencountered) that are markedly not like us in ways that can be easily identified, and we naturally react with caution and care the next time we encounter one.  If it were not for this instinct, the human race would have gone extinct long ago.</p>

			<p>Racism, or bigotry, can be said to be a form of bias.  Bias is usually based on prior experience, whether empirical evidence (ie learning the hard way that bees sting) or evidence from trusted sources, ie your father telling you never to buy a Ford.</p>
<p>Eliminating all bias (an example of which is racism) would open you up to a host of dangers that you previously avoided.  There are several substances that can induce this behavior temporarily: alcohol or methamphetamine for example.  Chronic drunks and meth users are much more likely to contract STDs because they are more tolerant of risk and engage in dangerous behavior.  No one would argue that eliminating bias like this is a positive outcome. </p>
<p>Why is eschewing a group of people who are known to be dangerous considered a negative outcome?</p>

			<p>OK&hellip;.now, for this to be an empirical piece of research,<br>
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE TOOK 20 BLACK AND ASIANS AND STUDIED THEIR RACIST RESPONSE? No answer, was the reply.<br>
I rest my case (and anyway, such an experiment would be killed stone-dead before it got off the ground due to fear of an overt form of racism.).<br>
Muddy and biased research such as this is totally out of place in this bankcrupt world that we now find ourselves in.<br>
Still, every cloud&hellip;.perhaps the lack of funding for wooly research such as this will dry up. Similarly, I wish that the people who conducted this &#8216;research&rsquo; would dry up and find themselves a proper job (something suitable like cleaning drains or cleaning out horse boxes, for example).<br>

			<p>These kinds of laboratory experiments are something out of the Twilight Zone!</p>
<p>This kind of mind-manipulation is morally destructive and should be exposed for the weird science-fiction mind-game it is.</p>
<p>What right has a psychologist to decide that a preference for a partner of one&rsquo;s own race is an unhealthy bias? Did God reveal this to the social scientists? Is there scientific proof that same-race preference is a mental disorder?</p>
<p>The social scientists have stopped being scientists (if ever they were) and have started playing God.</p>

			<p>I suppose, putting it bluntly&hellip; we need to DISREGARD all the negative aspects and anti-social behavior of typicals Black Americans and pretend their crimes, parasitism and dysfunctionality is imaginary. At the risk of being a pessimist, allow me to suggest the chances of a Black president actually CHANGING the Black mentality for the better&hellip; are about the same as the chances of hitting the lottery twice in a row!</p>
<p>What our esteemed sociology experts like to call racial bias&hellip; is simply White reaction to the awareness of the automatic propensity of the MAJORITY of Blacks to engage in crime and sociopathic behavior.</p>

			<p>Obama will single-handedly do more to inspire white racial unity that the fact that blacks (13% of the population) commit over 90% of all interracial crimes in America, the loud in your face profane rap music, the Hollywood miscegenation, the drive bye shootings, the carjacking, the welfare parasitism, affirmative action, and racial quotas combined&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; which often seems to be defined to mean that one notices that there are different races and prefers one&rsquo;s own race, especially in mating choices, is not something to be overcome, but something to be encouraged.  It&rsquo;s called survival.</p>
<p>And,the concept &#8220;survival&#8221; has a much deeper meaning than just the survival of the individual. Indeed, the individual is less important than the survival of the &#8220;inner person&#8221;  &mdash;  the genotype and phenotype.</p>
<p>If an individual survives and produces children not of his or her genotype and phenotype, then he or she has not really survived at all because he or she will not be present in the next generation and has thus become extinct.</p>
<p>When we say that the &#8220;fittest&#8221; survive, we mean that in the next generation, those from the just past generation, though their individual bodies have died, are still present in their unmolested, and unchanged genotype and phenotype carried by their children.</p>

<p>We give a young man or woman a gun and tell them to go kill for all kinds of reasons, mostly economic, and that&rsquo;s alright but if that same person wants his/her family to marry within the same race as his/her ancestors then that person is sick. Really?</p>
<p>I can fully understand if a Jew, Muslim or Catholic doesn&rsquo;t want the family to marry outside the religion and most of the world is OK with this idea if it doesn&rsquo;t lead to violence. If a person is free to have a religious belief based on nothing then shouldn&rsquo;t that same person be allowed a racial belief based on something. A belief is a belief and is based on a person&rsquo;s right to control their own mind and when we lose the ability to control our own thoughts we will be worse off than slaves.</p>
<p>There have been many more Holly Wars than Race Wars so shouldn&rsquo;t these people be trying to cure religion or even better politics? </p>

			<p>Racist=non-whites within the borders of American who desire and are actively participating in the perpetuation of post-1965 immigration policy with the intent to reduce the Native Born White American majority population to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. </p>
<p>Keep it simple folks. It is all about psychological warfare. Don&rsquo;t fumble and stumble around the periphery of this great battle. Tell it like it is. Charges of racism should be hurled immediately back at the enemy. I accuse the authors of this study of being anti-white racists.</p>

			<p>The surprising thing to me about this article is that it is considered newsworthy by Wired Science.  This conditioning of whites has been going on for years. Try to find a movie or TV show or advertisement anyplace in America that doesn&rsquo;t have blacks in positive role model positions and you&rsquo;ll find that few exist. </p>
<p>The attempt to blend whites into non-existence by having them mate with blacks (which is where this is going) is constant from kindergarten on up.  Natural white survival instincts are being reprogrammed with what is little more than classical conditioning techniques that are essentially the same as the ones used in advertising.  </p>
<p>Whites are told not to believe their own eyes and instead believe that blacks are just like whites and that no distinctions at all should be made when you are considering mating choices.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genocide, plain and simple.  And, whites are the victims.</p>

			<p>Just what is wrong with racism? Given racist views are based on our perceptions&hellip; from everything we&rsquo;ve seen, heard, read of other racial groups. Unless you bury your head, ostrich-like, in the sand, you can&rsquo;t help but realize Blacks and Hispanics commit the vast majority of domestic crimes. For every greedy rat sucking the lifeblood out of Enron, you probably have fify or a hundred Blacks who committed rape, robbery, burglary, car-thefts, even murder, not to mention dealing in drugs. Which holds true for the Mexican population as well. Are we expected to blot out all that negative data we get about Blacks and Hispanics&hellip; so we&rsquo;re not deemed to be racists?</p>
<p>I have never mingled socially with Blacks or Hispanics, and never will. We have nothing in common and I am not in the least bit interested in mingling with them more than absolutely necessary. A feeling I&rsquo;ll wager is shared by MILLIONS of American people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Being around blacks in a fatiguing, soul-draining chore.</p>
<p>There are many &lsquo;caveats&rsquo; involved in dealing with blacks. You have to question your every word and action so as not to set them off. Then there are those who are looking to set you off by being in-your-face rude and pushy. They want you to lose it so they can scream &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a victim of racism&rsquo;. &#8220;</p>
<p>Sbuffalonative is so right.  Being around blacks requires is like being in a lion&rsquo;s cage.  It requires constant attention to what is going on and watching your back.</p>
<p>In 40 years of working, I first experienced a pleasant, functional, efficient all white workplace for about 5 years.  </p>
<p>Then along came affirmative action.  I spent the next 20 years working with vicious, useless blacks who spent their time quarrelling, chatting, squabbling and complaining while us Whites did their work and were constantly threatened with racism charges.</p>
<p>The worst was the sexual harassement we whites had to endure from the black men. If we complained, the HR white commie feminazis charged us with racism.  </p>
<p>Blacks constantly made false charges against the whites.  </p>
<p>I and my supervisor once observed a 400 pd black ghetto woman go through all my file cabinets misfiling everything.  Then she came to my boss claiming that she needed to get a file from my office and couldn&rsquo;t find it in the proper place. While looking for the file she couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that everything was misfiled.  </p>
<p>Instead of telling the black woman she had been observed messing up my files, the supervisor just thanked her for reporting the problem.  Then the supervisor helped me refile everything in 3 file cabinets.</p>
<p>Then Praise the Lord!!  Great day in the morning!!!!</p>
<p>Affirmative action threw out the blacks and imported Asians, Mexicans and others to deny whites jobs.  So I have spent the last 15 years of my working life with pleasant, polite, efficient Asians, hispanics, Indians and others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the change in a workplace when blacks are forced out by the latest pampered minority.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; is just your natural genetic interests at work. Consider the following;</p>
<p> YOU MUST CHOOSE;</p>
<p>Tomorrow 100 Million people will suddenly be added to the world. They will be either;</p>
<p>1) Christians or Muslims.</p>
<p>2) English speakers, Spanish speakers, Arabic speakers, Chinese speakers.</p>
<p>3) Whites, Blacks, Mongolians.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s say this fantastic scenario was true and you had to choose. Wouldn&rsquo;t you logically choose to strengthen your own group? This is the reality of &#8220;racism&#8221;. It is merely a genetic impulse, an ethnic reflex.</p>

<p>Not a peep of skepticism whether it&rsquo;s actually even possible for science to DEFINE racism, much less cure it. Our culture has been swatted over the head with the &#8220;racism&#8221; baseball bat so incessantly, people talk as if it&rsquo;s a tangible, measurable thing. <br>
 <br>
Three cheers for latter-day Orwellian &#8220;science&#8221; which simultaneously claims race doesn&rsquo;t exist but that racism is a real thing which the scientific method can cure. <br>

<p>Excellent comment, Daniel! <br>
Frankly,  and to be precise, I can&rsquo;t think  of ANY race wars that have ever been fought. But there have been many wars fought over religion. <br>
And MANY, MANY wars fought over politics.  So, shouldn&rsquo;t they be trying to &#8220;cure&#8221; us of politics first?   That would seem to be the real illness afflicting us, not race.</p>

Even right here, on this computer screen, every time I turn it on or go to some site, I get those same advertisements, full of blacks, worse than ever.  Are there no white people left?   I &#8216;m not sure if it&rsquo;s my imagination, but  it  does seem to me that since Obama&rsquo;s election victory, we&rsquo;ve been getting even more of these ads  than before. Everything is getting to be black now.  Does anybody else notice this?</p>

Hutus and Tutsis in Ruanda in the 1990s.<br>
Japan against the world, 1937-1945.<br>
Germans against Jews, 1933-1945.<br>
Whites against Indians, Western Hemisphere, 1492-?<br>
Europe against Africa, 1870s(?)-?<br>
WBTS, 1861-1865.</p>
<p>All wars are fought for a mixture of reasons, dynastic, economic, vanity, survival, cultural conflict, greed, fear, honor, anything that makes one man want to pick up a stick and whack another.  These conflicts, and many others, have a strong racial component.  If you want to define &#8220;race war&#8221; as a war that has no reason whatsoever but a desire to ensure that you&rsquo;ll never have to see dark skin again in your life, then you might not find one.  </p>

			<p>Dear Schoolteacher:  Sorry,  I do not consider ANY of those conflicts to be specifically &#8220;racial&#8221; wars.  Nor were such inter-group power struggles definable  even  as &#8220;wars&#8221;.   (We&rsquo;re waging a 140-year-old war against Africa? Oh?  From what I can see around me, I would have thought it was the other way around!)   Your definition would be suitable for any Marxist textbook;  or any white-hating, grudge-bearing Afro-centrist,  but I do not agree.</p>
<p>One could mention the Punic Wars of Rome vs. Carthage,as being very close (and I thought of them) but they too were more political - about trade and power -  not about race.  Rome and Carthage didn&rsquo;t fight because they didn&rsquo;t like each other&rsquo;s looks.    Even the advance of Roman legions  northward into  Northern Europe (accompanied by widespread slaughter and enslavement) had a racial tinge somewhat    &mdash;    darker people conquering lighter ones   &mdash;   but it was never specifically racial per se.   A tribal conflict such as between Tutsis vs. Hutus was seen many times in the Americas too, where tribe slaughtered tribe, sometimes exterminating the other-  even sacrificing and eating them.  But it wasn&rsquo;t racial.  And since when is hatred of black vs. black considered &#8220;racial&#8221;?   That same violence is going on all the time in Africa today without arousing much outrage. . Nobody condemns it as racial (although they may condemn it on other grounds).  </p>
<p> I suspect that one reason for the absence of true race wars in world history is the fact that - at least in former times - oceans and vast distances separated the various major races.  That is no longer the case today, however. So we may be seeing them in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, the very best, the very closest, example of a true &#8220;Race War&#8221;  is the one - albeit undeclared - that is being waged AGAINST WHITES RIGHT NOW, everywhere in the Western world.  But it is subtle, covert, sub rosa, and most whites  don&rsquo;t even realize it&rsquo;s going on   &mdash;   although many vaguely suspect that something is terribly wrong.</p>

I do. I agree with you. My screen shows the same. Formerly, we were getting A LOT of blacks.  But lately, it&rsquo;s ALMOST ALL  blacks.</p>

     I didn&rsquo;t say they were specifically racial wars, I said that they had a strong racial component, that race was one of the important factors.  Most particularly, the people involved saw them as race wars.  <br>
     We are accustomed to referring to African &#8220;tribes&#8221;, but tribes don&rsquo;t number in the millions.  We don&rsquo;t call the Basques a tribe, how many are there of them?  Tutsi and Hutu are nations, two people who regard each other as aliens, forced by circumstance to share the same territory.  Yes, there is interbreeding, there are bi-cultural people who can pass as either, but your average Hutu who sets out to hack a Tutsi to death knows what he&rsquo;s looking for.<br>
     The Japanese regard themselves as altogether different from all other peoples, and proved it by treating all other peoples as dirt.  When the Marines caught on that the Japanese did not fight by any rules, the war became a war of extermination.  Marxists whine about the A-bombs, but at the time, some of the people in the know saw the bomb as a humane alternative to slaughtering the Japanese people entirely.  The Pacific war became a race war for us, but it was a race war from the beginning for Japan.<br>
     If the Nazis thought they were engaged in a race war against Jews, who are we to argue?<br>
     It&rsquo;s hard to see the expansion of Europeans from their crowded continent into the New World as anything but a race war.  The Indians had the land, the Whites wanted it, and killed the natives if they didn&rsquo;t move out of the way.  The conflict continues in South America, as the Presidents of Venezuela and Paraguay seek to take power and wealth from the White minorities in the name of the Indians.<br>
     The Europeans expanded into Africa as well, but found the place much less hospitable.  They saw the Blacks as &#8220;half savage, half child&#8221;, and relied upon massive firepower to educate them.  Sounds racist to me.  In the last half century, as Europe lost its nerve, the Africans are now invading their former overlords lands, raping and killing.  I believe it&rsquo;s called &#8220;4th generation warfare&#8221; by professional military men.  <br>
     Understand, I do not criticize those who wage war for racial reasons, I am no marxist/liberal believer in equality, racial or otherwise.  Nor do I fault those non-White peoples who fought against us.  Everybody&rsquo;s got to try to survive.  My point is that racial war is a historic fact, and it is still with us today.  Military and geo-strategic thinkers may use terms like &#8220;clash of civilizations&#8221;, or &#8220;4th and 5th generation warfare&#8221;, but they know all about the racial divisions of the world.  Deep in the bowels of the Pentagon, some analyst is reading this website and others of a racial nature, both pro and anti-White, and calculating the intensity of racial antagonism.  Obama wants to form an alternate army, a &#8220;national security force&#8221; is it?  Does anyone believe that he wants it in order to stop Moslem terrorists?  I cannot say that open racial conflict is coming, but it&rsquo;s certainly not unprecedented.<br>
