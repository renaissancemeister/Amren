			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail Reporter (London), January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A headteacher has come under fire from parents and pupils after banning two 16-year-olds from school for being &#8216;too blonde&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Raegan Booth, 16, and Aby Western, 15, say they were threatened with expulsion by David Alexander unless they dyed their hair brown.</p>
<p>The girls claim they are being forced to adhere to the strict dress code of Rednock School in  Dursley, Gloucestershire, in order to sit GCSE exams.</p>
<p>But Raegan remains adamant that her hair is a natural shade of blonde.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;The school rules clearly state that there are to be no &#8220;unnatural&#8221; hair colours on students.</p>
<p>&#8216;Unnatural hair colours are blue, purple, green and bright red. Blonde is considered a natural hair colour and there are many different shades.</p>
<p>&#8216;The head claims that he must follow the rules. To me this suggests that certain students are being made to look a way which is against their will.</p>
<p>&#8216;I believe this is wrong and no amount of hair dye affects a person&rsquo;s ability in school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The teenager, who is refusing to dye her hair a darker shade, added: &#8216;As we are in the middle of our GCSE year, we should not be excluded over something so petty.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is a crucial time for us and we should be focusing solely on our grades as opposed to our level of appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Martin Booth, Raegan&rsquo;s father said: &#8216;Raegan is a model pupil and is working very hard towards her exams.</p>
<p>&#8216;She is always well turned out, her hair looks a very natural blonde.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is their final year, they are under enough pressure with GCSEs, they do not need to be worrying about their hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Alexander, who is due to meet with Raegan, denies the claims.</p>
<p>He said that the girls were sent home only to dye their hair, and that they would still have been allowed to sit their GCSE exams.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We would not stop any student from sitting their GCSEs, it is in our interests that every student sits their GCSEs at the school.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are just trying to be consistent and apply the rules across the board. This code of conduct has been in place for a long time.</p>
<p>&#8216;However I am going to be meeting with parents to talk about looking again at the code and making it more clear.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think the problem is how you interpret the rules and we need to make it clearer for the students and parents.</p>
<p>&#8216;I accept this is a stressful time for the GCSE students, but we have to be consistent with our rules and must apply it to all year groups, otherwise it would be unfair.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Can we assume that if an albino wanted to study at the school that they would also have to dye their hair?</p>
<p>Albinism comes in various degrees and it is perfectly possible for an adult to have a form of albinism that gives them a hair color one would normally expect to see only in children.  This means there is no shade of blonde too light to occur naturally, and that even a person whom you are <i>sure</i> is dyeing their hair might in fact just happen to have a mild form of albinism.</p>
<p>Though, really now, I don&rsquo;t see anything that even <i>looks</i> unnatural in these girls&rsquo; hair.  One of the hallmarks of fake blonde hair is that it is the same exact shade of blonde everywhere, from the roots to the tips, and every individual hair exactly the same.  Natural blonde hair tends to have slight variations in color (in fact the word &#8216;blond(e)&rsquo; originally meant &#8216;blended&rsquo; some time long ago).  While hairstylists can perform various magic tricks to make dyed blonde hair look natural, most women don&rsquo;t seem to be that interested in it.  </p>

			<p>That milk white skin is offensive as well;  they should be required to regularly use a self-tanning lotion.  And those bright blue eyes;  make them buy dark brown contact lenses. Other students will have a lessened self-esteem when they compare themselves to these young ladies.  They must be made to blend in with the browning British population.</p>

			<p>Why am I not surprised this is happening in the UK? Either way, we are talking about a place where White schoolgirls have been arrested for complaining to their teacher, they can&rsquo;t understand the language spoken in their study group by foreign students. It seems it is a crime to be white there today. Blond hair is a trait that is almost exclusive to whites, so it is little wonder it is now looked upon as offensive. It seems anything which reminds their ethnic immigrants of white people, or the fact that they themselves aren&rsquo;t white, or are indeed foreign, is now considered offensive. The UK has gone loony, I once had great respect for it, but no longer. In fact, it is one of the last places on earth I would want to live today.</p>

			<p>Words fail me.  It all reminds me of Hitler and his dark Jewish stereotypes.  Wonder what ethnicity David Alexander is?  </p>
<p>Maybe the girls should leave the state prison school  system and go to a crammer for A levels. That would do them some good. GCSE&rsquo;s mean very little. </p>
<p>Is &#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor Phillips involved?  Are there a lot of Africans in that school?  Africans hate white girls and especially hate white women&rsquo;s hair, and Asian&rsquo;s hair, and everything about any other race than their own African tribeswomen. </p>
<p>There have been stories like this posted on amren.  When a blonde white girl was beaten by a predatory pack of black girls on a school bus the school prinicpal defended the predators.  Apparently they had a right to beat the white blonde because her blonde hair and pretty face gave her some many advantages. (Like being stuck on a bus where black predators had access to her and from which she could not escape.)</p>
<p>Another story involved an HR feminazi holding a meeting of white women.  They were told not to &#8220;flip&#8221; their hair while at work because the sight of their hair made the black women &#8220;uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have long reddish blonde hair.  When I was in high school the black female predators had a sort of rap song about me.  It was garbled and incoherent, but the gist of it was &#8220;the redhead soon will be dead!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>You go, girl!  If the school meant that no student is to color his or her hair at all, then the word &#8220;unnatural&#8221; should be deleted.<br/>

			<p>If the school rules prohibit hair dye, then obey the rules.  This is, I gather, I private school?  If they don&rsquo;t like the rules, go to another school.  <br/>
     These kinds of rules are not arbitrary.  The idea is that if it looks like a school and people dress like it&rsquo;s a school, they are more likely to act like it&rsquo;s a school, instead of a designers&rsquo; ball or a gathering of the tribes.  Teens will separate themselves into cliques over fashion, scorn each other for the wrong shoes, and ascribe human value to hairstyles.  During the school day, when we are attempting to teach higher values than what they get from the TV.  Every day I face a classroom full of students, and the only legitimate distinctions are ability and character.  In the classroom, not even race matters.  If a students wishes to distinguish herself, let her do creative work.</p>

			<p>It is ridiculous to say that students cannot bleach their hair if they want to, but at the same time these girls are liars. Obviously their hair is bleached   &mdash;   they have dark roots and eyebrows. But blonde is not an &#8220;unnatural&#8221; hair color, so even if their hair is bleached, it is not a violation of the dress code. They should challenge the administration&rsquo;s decision based on the fact that they have not broken the rules, not by lying.</p>

			<p>I do see a touch of darker roots which look to be light brown or ash blonde, but with their coloring and light colored eyes, the color suits them. It is certainly is more flattering on them, than it would be on a non-white with dark skin, eyes, and jet black roots showing through. The eyebrows are darker but not much, my y niece is 14 is a natural blonde, but her eyebrows are light brown, not blonde. The school needs to leave these girls alone, it isn&rsquo;t as though they are wearing retro punk hairdos, like purple mohawks. And it is refreshing to see English school girls who actually look the part, instead of looking dusky refugees.</p>

			<p>While I don&rsquo;t know the girls or the the headmaster involved in this, judging from the picture, the girls do have a somewhat provokative look. I think that&rsquo;s probably what this case is about. I see this as being less of a case about Anti-Whiteness, and more about a school trying to desexualize what should be a learning environment. Even if the shade of blonde is quote unquote natural, it&rsquo;s clearly not those two girls&rsquo; natural color.<br/>
What I see when I look at that picture is two teenage girls in schoolgirl outfits with bleach blonde hair and too much makeup. I can see where the school is coming from.</p>

			<p>I am confused.  The school rules state that students are not allowed to dye their hair.  BUT&hellip;the school officials are going against their own rules &amp; telling these girls to dye their hair?  Isn&rsquo;t that a oxy-moron??  <br/>
Is it racist to be a blonde?  Are these girls too White also??  The nerve of these girls to born White &amp; beautiful!!!!  <br/>
I think the non-White students are just jealous.</p>

I&rsquo;ve actually wondered how long it would be before whites would required to wear bronzers to darken their offensively white skin. Funny, I didn&rsquo;t consider it happening to hair first or at all. I guess they beat me on this one.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get too worked up about this. The key word in the dress code is &#8220;unnatural.&#8221; These girls are clearly sporting something other than their natural hair colors. One needs to choose one&rsquo;s battles carefully. In this case, I would not challenge the school&rsquo;s loco parentis status.</p>

			<p>Not knowing the surrounding details I&rsquo;d refrane from being certain what this really means. As usual some insightful comments suggesting a growing anti white bias in white homelands but the comments by Schoolteacher and especially  Winston Smith struck me as important. When I see these girls, ..I think wow, how tenderly refined and pretty, yet with disgust I fear so much is lost when these fine examples of femininity don&rsquo;t realize they are far more than sex objects or even academic objects. Beauty is made complete with modesty, dignity, intelligence, goodness and humility. I&rsquo;m afraid some of this sober dignity has been lost. </p>

			<p>     Two girls trying to be blonde. Who can blame them<br/>
really, but still it&rsquo;s wrong. People should be what<br/>
they are. Certainly a private school is no place for<br/>
this kind of thing. If they want to be fake blonde<br/>
sluts, why not just go to public schools. Private schools<br/>
are for more serious and/or classy people. I know what<br/>
the racial issue is, but this story seems a poor example<br/>
of it.</p>

			<p>Their hair does look dyed. They may very well be natural blondes - as in darker blonde, but these are dye jobs. </p>
<p>Still, reading the article it&rsquo;s my understanding that there is a prohibition against faddish hair dyes - green/blue/red/purple ect. These dyed blonde students don&rsquo;t have a faddish look. </p>

			<p>The good thing about this story is that it has gone around the world. And many non questioning whites will just read the headline and think blondes are being outlawed in Britain.<br/>
And hopefully get a little angry.</p>

			<p> This ia nothing but a feeble attempt at yet another attack aimed at white culture. Pure and simple, nothing more. The teacher can do no wrong, as usual, and it&rsquo;s tailor made for the media. Whites will get angry, minorities and their supporters will laugh, kids pay the price with yet another new found fear.</p>
<p>Other schools and teachers will learn yet another tactic in the war of defeatism and self loathing. Minorities will be that much more &#8220;empowered&#8221; and the white working class that much more frustrated.</p>

			<p>&lsquo;I accept this is a stressful time for the GCSE students, but we have to be consistent with our rules and must apply it to all year groups, otherwise it would be unfair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What you should accept, old boy, is the fact that the rule was made to prevent kooks from coloring their hair a deep purple or bright blue, something garish and unnatural.  </p>
<p>This multicult, more than likely, figured that if he let these girls go to another shade he would have to shift his idiotic multicult conditioned brain into gear and allow blacks or other dark complected people to do the same, which indeed would be unnatural and disruptive.</p>
<p>In addition to that we have to consider that this could well be just another leftist nut case who is so wrapped up in what is probably a hatred of blonds he can&rsquo;t conduct himself properly.</p>
<p>But one thing is for certain, this is just another example of the failure of public schools.</p>
<p>A small group of white parents should get together and undergo a harassment program covertly to destroy the credibility of this geek so that anything he has to say in the future will either be ridiculed or laughed at openly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a war, and psychological warfare is an important weapon in any conflict.  The left uses it effectively.  They should get it pushed right back in their faces at every turn until they&rsquo;re so stupified they don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re coming or going.</p>

			<p>A long-time lurker of AmRen but sorry, I don&rsquo;t see this one as a race issue.  I am a White woman, by the way.  </p>
<p>These are suicide blondes, &#8216;dyed&rsquo; by their own hands.  They look a bit slutty in that picture, hardly an image of school girls but &#8216;come hither.&rsquo;  They dyed their hair after the fact, they knew what they were doing, they knew the rules.  The one excuse being that it looks natural when, in fact, it looks cheap.  And the idiot Dad upholds his daughter&rsquo;s blatant disobedience.  </p>
<p>Looking entirely distracting during this &#8220;stressful&#8221; week, concentration should be put on the work at hand, not the obviously fake dye-job to draw attention to themselves.  Enhance your hair color but not here and not now.  I stand by the teacher.      </p>

			<p>I was sympathetic to them at the beginning of the story. But upon viewing their picture, I see that their hair is bleached to a pale straw at the ends but is still dark at the roots. Who are they fooling? It doesn&rsquo;t even look like natural blond hair.</p>
<p>Even so, this whole hullaballoo is nonsense. Does the school have nothing better to concern itself with?  I wonder if there was a jealous complainant who started all of this.</p>

			<p>These girls are chavs. It&rsquo;s not their blonde hair so much as their slutty poses and the stupid expressions on their faces. Their the problem with whites in Great Britain these days, not the solution.</p>
<p>The father is encouraging his girl to disrespect authority; teaching her to feel entitled from society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of standing up to educational authority when that authority is teaching stupid multicultural jumbo. But stand up wisely and make the PC look as stupid as it is and make the teacher look like a fool.</p>

			<p>I was full of sympathy till I saw their pic, and I have to agree with some of the other posts here  &mdash;  -it ain&rsquo;t natural.<br/>
I&rsquo;m a very white woman who dyes her hair, and I know roots when I see them.  The eyebrows are a dead give away too.</p>
<p>Although it is a natural shade of blonde (just not for them, lol), I&rsquo;m going to save my sympathy and support for a more worthy victim.</p>

<p>I would do the same. The rules should be clear. When the school doesn&rsquo;t want the students to color their hair at all, they should state it directly and not toss around such equivocal terms as &#8220;unnatural&#8221;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but flaxen blonde is a natural coloring, as are reddish-brown or copper-red shade, only a rare one. Nothing unnatural in my eyes. </p>

			<p>I doubt their hair is dyed blonde. I&rsquo;m a guy and my hair was that color up through my early 20&rsquo;s then it just became darker. When I was young, the blonde hair would get lighter as it grew out due to exposure to light / sun. What is Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s background?</p>

			<p>While it would be outrageous if the social engineers were trying to force natually blond(e) students to darken their hair, I think the article has been misunderstod. The article states, &#8220;Raegan remains adamant that her hair is a natural shade of blonde.&#8221; From this it seems the two girls argue that because their hair is dyed a natural hair colour it should be allowed, as opposed to unnatural hair colours like &#8220;blue, purple, green and bright red&#8221;. It is not that the school is opposed to blond hair, but to any dying of hair. </p>
<p>A policy against dying is similar to traditional school policy which was in force in my school days, both for boys and girls. While it is important to be vigilant against multiculturalists and enemies of European culture and heritage, Rednock School in Dursley, Gloucestershire is perhaps more sympathetic to British traditional identity and values than many schools. From the photograph of the girls, they do seem to have two-tone hair, the darker shade suggesting their natural hair colour is a light brown. </p>

			<p>Some of you posters just haven&rsquo;t read this article properly.  Or perhaps, you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>She never said that this was her own natural blond color.  She said the color itself is a natural blond color, as opposed to orange or purple.  And she&rsquo;s right.  Have you people never seen Scandinavians?  They have very light blond hair.  Germans too.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the fact that over summer vacation, blond hair becomes much lighter due to sun bleaching.  I&rsquo;m blond, and I was even blonder when I was a kid.  And my hair always got much lighter during the summer.  Then of course it grows out and the &#8220;darker&#8221; roots begin to show around September or October.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me what is so &#8220;slutty&#8221; about their appearance?  And what is so &#8220;provocative&#8221; about their poses?  Is it because YOU have the bigoted view that &#8220;blonds&#8221; are slutty in general?<br/>

			<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m with Schoolteacher et al on this one.  It&rsquo;s nonsense to say that blonde is &quot;a&quot; natural colour; it&rsquo;s not <em>their</em> natural colour. Nor is it a &quot;fact&quot; that the intent of the rule is to prohibit green or purple dye jobs.  I think the people who made the rule and enforce it probably know its intent better than we do.</p>
<p>Here in South Africa there is a vogue among black footballers to bleach their hair.  It looks ridiculous; like a brass pot scourer pasted on their heads.  Should the school allow black pupils to go blonde, too?</p>
<p>The English school culture is much stricter in the matter of dress codes than the American.  These girls knew they were breaking the rules.  When I was at school, I also chafed under what I regarded as the petty rules.  But that&rsquo;s what civilization is about; you don&rsquo;t get to decide which rules suit you.</p>
<p>And there is no contradiction is the teacher requiring them to dye their hair again.  He is telling them to dye it their <em>natural</em> colour.</p>

			<p>&#8220;These girls are chavs. It&rsquo;s not their blonde hair so much as their slutty poses and the stupid expressions on their faces. Their the problem with whites in Great Britain these days, not the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you even know what a Chav is? These girls are far from what I would consider a chav.  Chavs are on the lowest rung of society (usually by choice) and make life miserable to anyone that has the unfortunate pleasure of encountering one.<br/>

			<p>Hard to say, really, if they are bleached or just have &#8220;tips&#8221;. I live in Minnesota, where, as a kid, blond was the average hair color, not the exception. I was born blond, but as I grew up, it gradually grew to become auburn. My wife is the same. That is very common. All of my kids began as blonds as well and only one has blue eyes. So, eyebrows don&rsquo;t do much for me, that is a fallacy that blonds have blond eyebrows all of the time  &mdash;  they don&rsquo;t. Lighting conditions can also make roots look darker than they really are.</p>
<p>What blond is and isn&rsquo;t is just one of the many fascinating aspects to being European. Like everything else about us, it is a sign of our true and innate diversity. Unlike the rest of the world, which only has black hair and nearly black eyes, we have great variation in skin tone, hair and eye color. Nothing is written in stone when it comes to this diversity of whites.</p>

It&rsquo;s the same thing with the movie <i><b>&#8220;Hairspray&#8221;. </b></i> All the evil ones are blond, and what&rsquo;s worse, they&rsquo;re slim, shapely and good-looking too. Every last one!  And WASPY as well.  Horrors!  Can&rsquo;t have that.  The beauteous, blonde Michelle Pfeiffer is the meanest, sneakiest witch of them all who in the end gets what she has coming to her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the heroine  (butterball Nikki Blonsky)  and all the other  &#8220;good&#8221;  people are short, fat, dark, and dumpy.  And of course, the Blacks are the absolute heroes of the show, who triumph  in the end and put all those  snooty,  bigoted, evil whites in their place.   </p>
<p>Oh yes, and miscegenation is presented as the panacea  for everyone&rsquo;s problems, with Once You Go Black You&rsquo;ll Never Go Back providing the themesong.</p>

   Nonsense!  The issue here is not that they can&rsquo;t be blonde, but that  students can&rsquo;t have ARTIFICIAL hair colors.  That goes for ANY color.</p>
<p>In other words, nobody is saying that real blondes can&rsquo;t be blond,  But these girls aren&rsquo;t blonds, they&rsquo;re fakes.  The school says you can&rsquo;t be a fake, that&rsquo;s all,  and I&rsquo;ll go with that.</p>

			<p>&#8220;These girls have very dark roots, and are not natural blondes, They would be far better off in a shade that is not so unnatural. Part of education is teaching young people not to make fool of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 1:43 PM on January 24 </p>
<p>&gt; I&rsquo;ve studied the photos too and they are blondes, just darker than the dye they used.  As far as unnatural, near white blonde hair does exist naturally, so what is unnatural about it?</p>
<p>How can those girls be making fools of themselves, the hair color certainly does not clash with their skin or eye color the way it does when say, a Black female entertainer straightens and dyes her hair blonde or wears a blonde wig.</p>
<p>If school rules say no hair dye, then that is that.  However, when Muslims are being allowed to show their religion and ethnicity with hair style, headress, etc., a slightly lighter blonde should be no big deal.  This is what makes the incident stand out.</p>

<p>&gt; Ever noticed how shows like CSI and others usually focus on a White male perp?  All these shows would have us believe that most crime is perpetrated by Whites.  All part of the MSM cover-up for reality in the streets.  It sure seems like a conspiracy to me.  Once aimed specifically at White males, it is now aimed at young White girls in order to make them not want to be White.  That will likely steer them to non-White mates along with all the other pressures.  This is nothing less than slow genocide.</p>

			<p>I doubt that black students would ever be threatened with expulsion were they to bleach their hair blond.  And besides, when blacks color their hair blond, it has an orangy kind of tone.  So, no, it would never look like these girls&rsquo; hair.</p>
<p>The teacher said that they should dye their hair <i>brown</i>, which, if you take a look at their roots, is NOT brown but an ashy blond.</p>
<p>And BTW, I&rsquo;d like to know why this happened all of a sudden?  It&rsquo;s obvious that these girls had colored their hair a while ago, since the natural roots are showing.  Why weren&rsquo;t they threated with expulsion the very day they became blonder?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a reflection of how our demographics have changed in this country. Not long ago, I watched a biography on Cher, and on it she was saying as a young girl, she yearned to be blonde since not only were her Mother and sister blonde, but that at the time, Hollywood pushed blondes like Sandra Dee, Doris Day, and Marilyn Monroe as the American ideal, from girl next door to sex symbols. Nowadays Hollywood is not just moving in the direction of darker haired female stars, but darker skinned, more ethnic types, especially Hispanic and Mulatto. </p>

<p>This school&rsquo;s rules prohibit &#8220;unatural colors&#8221;  like pink, blue, purple etc. that some kids like to experiment with. Blonde is not an unatural color and I see nothing wrong or unatural with these girl&rsquo;s hair color and looks. I realise schools have certain rules that have to be followed but one has to use common sense. Expelling them for blonde hair is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Reading through all of this controversy, I see that the fault is with vague, poor terminology that was used by the school.</p>
<p>The issue simply comes down to whether their hair is an <i>&#8220;un-natural colour&#8221; </i>(such as green   &mdash;   which it is not),  or whether it is not <i>THEIR OWN natural color </i>(which is highly debatable, and I&rsquo;ll not get into that).</p>

There are now laws that can get them arrested for saying anything that even smacks of being anti non white, which they refer to as racial abuse. Strangely enough, their immigrant community can get up on a soapbox with megaphone in hand and give anti white, anti western speeches that threaten violence, and absolutely nothing is done about it.

			<p>They both look like to natural blonds who&rsquo;s hair began to turn a little mousy. This is something that can happen to many natural blonds, as early as their teens. In my case, the light blond hair I had in childhood, began to deepen to a more golden shade in my teens. By my 20&rsquo;s it became a bit dull and mousy, definitely less vibrant! From that point on, I began to highlight it&rsquo;s original lightness, something I continue to do to this day. The occasional roots show up signaling it needs a touch-up! Granted I am an adult, but would never allow anyone to call me fake or slutty for wearing my hair a color that it started off earlier in life to begin with. It looks a far cry more natural than if I were to go the opposite route, and were to dye it a cold black. The Goth looks doesn&rsquo;t suit me. I think these girls look fine, and hardly look slutty. I wonder if the young black girls in their school are singled out for pressing their hair or wearing weaves? That is far from natural, but somehow I doubt a word is said to them.</p>

<p>Yes, they are jealous.  I am in my late 30&rsquo;s, and highlight my hair. I am a natural dark blond with blue eyes.  When I was young, I had light blond hair.</p>
<p>I was at a buffet style restaurant with my family (a place I normally would not go to), and this little black girl was in the line next to me.  She looked up at me and said, &#8220;Your hair is ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as for British&hellip; I dated a British man, and all he could ever do was complain about how much makeup I was wearing.  Australians are the same way.  They are hypersensitive to anything that&rsquo;s not natural.  You would think that while the Western countries populations are half obese and grossly overweight, and so many people wear ugly clothing, there would be appreciation for someone who takes the time to try to look their best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad&hellip; Britain was a country that used to dress so beautifully, and now look at them.</p>

			<p>Hey, why can&rsquo;t whites who have blond hair, be considered a part of the overall &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; theme and left alone?  </p>
<p>I think the true goal isn&rsquo;t to diversify, but just the opposite. Whites have so much natural diversity  in terms of hair and eye color, I think certain factions would prefer we look more like non-whites, as to not remind them of our racial difference. Right now in the UK, they are banning bottle blonds, but it would not surprise me in the least if soon they will ban natural blonds. Though at the rate they are going there with Sharia law and all, soon nobody will know what color a girls hair is, since she will be forced to cover it up.</p>

I think you&rsquo;re onto something there. They&rsquo;ll eliminate the whole problem by covering it completely. That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>For some reason, Moslems are obsessed with women&rsquo;s hair.  They think it&rsquo;s indecent or obscene or something. Well, come to think of it, they they think EVERYTHING about a woman is indecent or obscene. Gotta cover everything up!  Woman is the embodiment of Evil, the instrument of Satan!</p>
<p>I wonder if this headmaster is a Moslem(?)<br/>

			<p>And more than likely from some non-white ethnic females. I always got the sense that many non-white females have a contempt for blondes <br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I witnessed such an while sitting in a waiting room at my doctors office. They had the TV up on the wall in the waiting room, and were airing a biography on Marilyn Monroe. She looked staggeringly beautiful as they showed scenes from her old movies. But two grossly overweight black women were sitting across from me watching it too. One of them piped up loudly and said, I never got what the big deal was with her, her hair-color was fake and so was her body. And the other woman said mmmm hmmm, and nodded vigorously. </p>
<p>Now granted, she did lighten her hair, when she became famous, but her body was all hers. There were no such thing as breast implants, in the early 50&rsquo;s when she became famous. </p>
<p>But the real irony is, both these women had the most unnatural weaves possible. Their hair was stick straight, long and glossy, but near the hairline, their own tightly kinky hair was plainly visible. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think what hypocrites they were being. Though I realized they were jealous they would never be as beautiful, shapely, or famous as the legendary Monroe was.</p>

<p>Yes, it seems even ankles and feet are considered provocative, since even that must be covered.</p>

			<p>Black woman, in my experience, especially those over a certain age and wight, simply cannot tolerate having <b><i>ANY  </i></b>other female in the room who is <i>younger, thinner, </i>or <i>lighter  </i>than they are. And that just goes for OTHER black women.  </p>
<p>However, when it comes to white women who are shapely and attractive, that just goes over the line!!!  And a pretty blonde is even worse. Black woman can&rsquo;t STAND it. There&rsquo;s murder in the air. </p>
<p>With the black men, however, the attitude  toward her is quite different. Which would also explain the black females&rsquo; deadly jealousy.</p>
