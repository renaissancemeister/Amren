<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0108/p25s20-woam.html">Narcotraffickers Attack Televisa, Mexico&rsquo;s Top TV Network</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara Miller Llana, Christian Science Monitor, January 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A grenade attack on Mexico&rsquo;s top television station during the nightly news Tuesday is the latest &mdash; and most high-profile &mdash; threat against freedom of expression in Mexico since President Felipe Calderón launched a concerted offensive against drug traffickers two years ago.</p>
<p>Media watch groups consider Mexico among the most dangerous places for journalists to operate. Reporters on the drug beat are increasingly the victims of intimidation as warring drug traffickers vie for power and lucrative routes into the US market.</p>
<p>Some 5,700 Mexicans were killed last year in drug-related violence &mdash; more than double the total from the record reached the year before. The majority of violence is between drug traffickers, but civil society &mdash; from businesses owners to bystanders, prosecutors to reporters &mdash; are increasingly victims. Many journalists now write without bylines &mdash; if they report on drug trafficking at all. And the attack on the TV station in the bustling, northern town of Monterrey, a manufacturing hub, is the latest sign that narcotraffickers don&rsquo;t want anyone covering their activities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broadcasters at Grupo Televisa reported on the attack live, as gunmen in two pickup trucks tossed a grenade and opened fire on the station in downtown Monterrey. A handwritten note left at the scene read: &#8220;Stop reporting just on us. Report on the narco&rsquo;s political leaders.&#8221; No one was injured in the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Media rights groups condemned the assault. &#8220;Fortunately there were no victims, but this attack shows that organized crime is targeting national as well as local media,&#8221; Reporters Without Borders said in a statement. &#8220;Solving this attack will be a new test for the government, which wants to make it a federal crime to use violence against the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Journalists in rugged border towns such as Juárez, where a quarter of all executions tallied by the government took place last year, say they are scared. Erika, a local drug gang reporter who did not want her last name published, says she was unwillingly moved into the post after her predecessor received a death threat. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want this job, especially because my mom is so worried,&#8221; she says. Sometimes she uses her byline; other times not.</p>
<p>Congressman Priego Tapia says the government has not paid enough attention to the plight of journalists &mdash; partially because they are part of the problem. While nearly all, if not all, of the executions of journalists are linked to organized crime, four of ten general threats, which can include breaking cameras or phone calls warning not to publish or even physical harm, come from Mexican authorities, he says.</p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious to everybody here that Mexico is losing the war on drugs much more miserably than we are, and every indication is that the situation will get worse every year as it has for the last several years now.</p>
<p>I saw on the Lou Dobbs show that the cartels are moving into the US now and are establishing areas here where they are in control.</p>
<p>I think drugs should be legalized, just as alcohol was.  The failed policy of prohibition proved unequivocally that the crime and chaos caused by outlawing liquor was causing so much corruption among politicians that it was in danger of gaining important footholds in society, and in order to reduce mob power and influence prohibition had to be reversed, because people made it very apparent they were going to drink, law or no law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with drugs.  If they aren&rsquo;t legalized so they can be controlled by some kind of government oversight I truly believe that Mexico&rsquo;s entire governmental structure will be taken over by the drug cartels, making it the world&rsquo;s first narco republic.</p>
<p>Pablo Escobar almost succeeded in controlling all of Columbia, and if he hadn&rsquo;t been impatient and moved so quickly for control he would have succeeded.</p>
<p>Have these new cartels learned a lesson from Escobar and will they now make certain they have greater control before making a move to take over completely?   And by that time how much influence will they have in the US?</p>
<p>The left loves to talk about &#8220;modernity.&#8221;  I doubt they realize that modernity doesn&rsquo;t mean moving closer to their version of utopia, but a backward lurch toward absolute chaos.</p>
<p>If the world economy tanks, I seriously doubt the drug gangs will see a drop in business, making them the most lucrative enterprise around, while others are going out of business.</p>

<p> What an absolute crock of rancid garbage. Yeah, these are the same jokers who bash Whitey AND America every chance they get. The First Amendment is nothing more than a weapon to be used to make money for these lowlifes.</p>
<p> If they had it their way, you and I would be fined and sent to jail for speaking out against them. &#8220;Without borders&#8221;&hellip;give me a break&hellip;.get a job losers. And next time you cross the border OUT of the US&hellip;stay there.</p>
<p> Just my 2 cents&hellip;</p>

			<p>I have advocated for years that drugs should be legalised and made cheap but the supply government contolled through medical outlets so that users are registered and known and can be &#8220;cured&#8221; and restricted from driving cars, certain jobs, etc on safety grounds just like alcoholics.   The taking of drugs is self-promoting for the dealesr sell cheaply to kids who get hooked, crime increases as the users need fixes and so on.   Another way would be to use the &#8220;Singapore Solution&#8221; where any dealer, as judged by the more than a small amount a user woud be carrying in his or her possession, on conviction, is executed within a week (no strung out appeals) and the judge has no other options such as a jail term.   That would greatly stop the distribution of drugs and cut crime.   Prohibition proved that banning such evils it does not work.</p>

			<p>Illegal drugs can&rsquo;t be the problem since they&rsquo;re illegal here too, and we don&rsquo;t have same murder numbers - except perhaps in Black and Hispanic urban centers. No, it&rsquo;s la raza of the people that are the source of the problem even though equalitarians are into denial about it.</p>

			<p>The only way to make a huge dent in the drug cartels is to expel all mestizos from our midst.  There is absolutely no way we can say, &#8220;Oh these are the good mestizos and these are the bad ones.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not working!  Instead, they&rsquo;re relying on our sense of fair play to do business.</p>
<p>Would legalizing drugs be a good thing?  I&rsquo;m not so sure.  Legalizing marijuana wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad because it&rsquo;s a softcore drug, but what if it was readily available everywhere?  What if we could buy coke and crystal meth at the local convenient store along with beer?  I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about Prohibition and the War on (Some) Drugs, but what isn&rsquo;t widely known is the role of money in both enacting and repealing the 18th Amendment. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_party" rel="nofollow">Prohibition Party</a> got six-figure votes in all presidential elections from 1884-1920. But its agenda never went anywhere because the federal govt. needed the revenue from liquor taxes and tariffs. That changed after World War I when Congress realized the new income tax brought in even more cash than that. So Prohibition was quickly ratified. It was quickly apparent that the law was causing widespread crime &amp; corruption, but all attempts at repeal failed in the 1920s because the booming economy was providing an income tax windfall. Then the Depression hit, income tax collections plummeted, and the feds suddenly needed that liquor revenue again. So the 21st Amendment was quickly ratified in 1933.</p>
