<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7828067.stm">Immigration Workers in BNP Probe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An investigation was launched after two immigration workers were suspected of being members of the far-right British National Party, it has emerged.</p>
<p>The UK Border Agency said the pair were employed in an immigration removal centre until a BNP member list was posted on the internet, last November.</p>
<p>An agency spokesman said one resigned and the other has been suspended.</p>
<p>He added anyone working with the agency must sign a declaration stating they are neither BNP nor Combat-18 members.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no place for racism in the immigration system,&#8221; the spokesman said.</p>
<p><b>Asylum seekers</b></p>
<p>The two workers were employed by a private contractor on behalf of the Home Office.</p>
<p>The investigation, which is looking into how the two staff may have slipped through the screening net, began following the resignation of one of them, last November.</p>
<p>Most people held at immigration removal centres are failed asylum seekers whose legal rights to stay in the UK have been exhausted.</p>
<p>The centres house them until they can be deported, which in some cases takes months.</p>
<p>Often, they are in breach of immigration regulations or thought to be likely to abscond while awaiting a decision on their case.</p>
<p>Simon Darby, deputy leader of the BNP, said he could not confirm that the two workers were party members.</p>
<p><b>Legal support</b></p>
<p>The internet list showed the full contact details of BNP members including home phone numbers and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Among them was a Merseyside police officer, who was suspended from duty while an investigation was undertaken. The force specifically bans all its officers from membership of the BNP, Combat 18 and the National Front.</p>
<p>Mr Darby said he did not know how many members&rsquo; jobs had been under threat since the publication of the list,but the party was offering legal support to those affected.</p>
<p>The BNP, an anti-immigration party, has won council seats in recent years, and took a London Assembly seat last May.<br>

			<p>The BNP is a legitimate political party, and it should be a right, upheld by law, that anyone may be a member and not suffer for it.</p>
<p>I hope to see them one day be the democratic choice of Britons.</p>

			<p>We all know how this will evolve.</p>
<p>Thousands of Brits will be BNP supporters without actually becoming formal members. They may send money to the organization. They may wear the t-shirt to bed every night. They might even have the cross of St. George in their bedroom closet, waiting for the day to bring it out.</p>
<p>The more they try to stamp out BNP, the more members they will have, and the more difficult it will be to hound them. </p>
<p>God bless them.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a regular poster over at the BNP site, and they are far, FAR more than a mere &#8220;anti-immigration&#8221; party. Immigration is only one plank of their nationalist platform, and I fervently hope that they move forward again in the June EU elections.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to be a paid member to vote for the BNP; anyone can vote BNP.</p>

			<p>No English White Christian has any legal right to question anything whatsoever to do with immigration, pakistan, africans and islam. Our UK immigration agency is stuffed with nigerians, indians, pakistanis and a myriad of muslims. Our boys fighting muslim fanatics in afghanistan hear distinct northern english accents over the enemy radio and our scottish communist government are fully aware that these belong to pakistani youth from manchester, leeds, bradford etc but refuse to restrict them from leaving or re-entering UK without them providing credible reasons for travel. Visiting a family wedding seems to be the usual reason given but pakistan won&rsquo;t follow up these claims. Suppose any are captured? UK does not have a Guantanamo and it&rsquo;s a sure bet that we UK taxpayers will provide some muslim lawyer to prove they accidentally strayed 100 miles over the border whilst chasing dangerous butterfies with an AK47 or some other pathetic excuse. Meanwhile, his pakistani family in UK will sob into the TV cameras and the entire streetful of pakistani relatives will say what a good boy he is, always polite, respectful, prays regularly and does well at school, his main qualification being that he can recite the entire quoran in arabic. White English Christian families who only had a year left in line on the waiting list for public housing only two years ago now find they have to wait ten years or more as huge pakistani immigrant families have priority due to their &#8216;more urgent social needs&rsquo;. Guess who runs these local government offices and allocates housing? Meantime, illegals from nigeria are cleared by our government to work in sensitive security jobs such as airports, the Houses of Parliament and guarding our PM, although, being scottish, he probably prefers africans to Englishmen. BNP candidates for local government are perfectly entitled to be elected and represent all in their constituency but to actually belong to the BNP is outlawed! Membership of the SNP (scottish national party) is kept secret although it&rsquo;s not considered unlawful to be a member. There are many ways to support the BNP. Voting is secret and anonymous donations are welcome. Letters to local newspapers will be vetted against the BNP but there are certain issues which can be highlighted without arousing suspicion. Your local BNP office can give guidance on how to phrase letters to the editor or simply use common sense and political savvy. </p>

You don&rsquo;t need to be a member to vote BNP. </p>
<p>The list is a members list. You can become an overseas member if you like. I&rsquo;m guessing you would qualify.   </p>

			<p>Memphomaniac is right.  The best way for the BNP to respond to this is to have a BNP &#8220;supporter&#8221;, as opposed to a card carrying BNP member, in these positions.  BNP supporters should not be on any BNP roster.  I&rsquo;m assuming the ballot is still secret in the UK, so they can safely vote BNP.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how draconian the government becomes to deal with that.</p>

<p><br>
   So being a member of BNP and being against fake refugees and high levels of immigration make you a racist? Obviously freedom of speech means nothing in formerly Great Britain. <br>

			<p>The reason that the BNP is heavily ostracized by the other main political main parties is that the BNP preaches what most people really want to hear to overcome their fears, so in true Marxist/Goebbels propaganda traditions the other parties plus the BBc and much of the Press keep up the propaganda.  The British National Party, a legally registered political party in the UK, is portrayed by the others as a &#8220;bunch of racists&#8221; not as they are, the ordinary, married ( as opposed to just living together) normal people who can see the future and object to the way the once Great Britian is going down the path as other countries appear to be (sic) that is, overcrowding and loss of identity, plus giving of public housing to immigrants ahead of those who have paid the taxes. In local elections where they are winning seats now, there have been some main opposition party councillors resign their memberships and join the BNP. But this could be so they can win some local elections so they stay on the gravy train, but who knows at present? If you want to read their &#8220;platform&#8221; see www.bnp.org.uk   They are called fascists by others but so much of the activities against them by other parties are definitely fascist in nature and actions and the BNP is quickly growing in membership as the other parties lose face due to bad leadership one result being te current financial crisis where savers are paying for thsoe who have been silly with their finances with excessive credit and, well you know the rest.</p>

<p>The thing about that it that European countries still have the argument that they are &#8220;homelands,&#8221; and that even white people have countries of origin. Since there is something written in the UN or the EU Constitution (I don&rsquo;t remember which) about an official policy of fighting genocide and ethnic cleansing, this can be applied to nationalist parties like the British National Party and Front Nationale, which clearly state that their interest is in protecting the native populations.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S. such an argument would be twisted against white people, as we are not considered to be natives of the North American continent. Such is the price we pay for living in the &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221;; it&rsquo;s not really a nation at all.</p>

			<p>What would be the best way for a BNP supporter in the U.S.A. to anonymously donate to the BNP?  Is stuffing cash in an envelope, and hoping the Royal Mail doesn&rsquo;t seize the funds, the only way?  (and that&rsquo;s assuming our increasingly laughable Yankee dollar would be more of a help to them than a bother to deal with)</p>

That need not be necessarily be relevant.  Who got here first is not everything.  Maybe we&rsquo;re not the <i><b>original natives </b> </i>of this continent (but to be precise, no one ever was indigenous to this continent. Some were just earlier immigrants than others).  However, WE ARE the founders and builders of the country that is today known as the United States. That should be enough.<br>

~~~~~~<br>
This specious argument is just another ploy that is used to de-legitimize and dispossess white people in America.  (We&rsquo;re not the &#8220;real&#8221; Americans.)</p>
<p>Traditionally, the rule always used to be that &#8220;possession is nine-tenths of the law.&#8221;  Whatever happened to that?<br>

<p>Actually all countries were formed at some point in history by migration. It&rsquo;s just that migration occurred much later in north america than in europe.</p>
