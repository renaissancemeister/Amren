<h1>Leamington Man Loses $150,000 in Nigerian Scam</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trevor Wilhelm, Windsor Star, January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Leamington man has fallen prey to international scam artists who strung him along for more than a year with the promise of millions in cash, but ultimately bilked him and his family of $150,000.</p>
<p>John Rempel said he quit his truck driving job, lost friends, borrowed money and crossed the globe in pursuit of a non-existent inheritance, after he was contacted by e-mail in what is known as a Nigerian 419 scam.</p>
<p>Rempel said he borrowed $55,000 from an uncle in Mexico and his parents gave him $60,000 on credit to cover fees for transferring $12.8 million into his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re in it now because of me,&#8221; said Rempel, 22, breaking into sobs. &#8220;If it wasn&rsquo;t for me, nobody would be in this mess. You think things will work out, but it doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a very bad feeling. I had lots of friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never get calls anymore from my friends. You know, a bad reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>His troubles began in July 2007. He said he got an e-mail from someone claiming to be a lawyer with a client named David Rempel who died in a 2005 bomb attack in London, England, and left behind $12.8 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;They used to come in the mail,&#8221; said Leamington police Const. Kevin O&rsquo;Neil. &#8220;Now the majority of these are sent through e-mail. Keeping up with the times, using all the wonderful technology that&rsquo;s available to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told once that they send out 30,000 e-mails a day, around the world, and they hope for just one or two responses. Once you return a phone call or return an e-mail, these people now have their hooks into you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer said his client had no family but wanted to leave the money to a Rempel. It was his lucky day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded all good so I called him,&#8221; said Rempel. &#8220;He sounded very happy and said God bless you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man then told him he had to pay $2,500 to transfer the money into his name. Then there were several more documents. Some cost $5,000.</p>
<p>He was told to open an account at a bank in London. That required a $5,000 minimum deposit. The crooks later sent him an e-mail with a link to what he was told were details of his new account. Some money had been transferred there for &#8220;safe keeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything was good,&#8221; said Rempel.</p>
<p>Then he got an e-mail from a government department  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s not sure which country  &mdash;  saying he owed $250,000 on tax on his inheritance. Rempel spoke to his contact, who told him they negotiated the fee down to $25,000.</p>
<p>Rempel went to Mexico where his uncle owns a farm. His uncle gave him $10,000 cash and money for a plane ticket. He was going to London to make sure it was legitimate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had $10,000 in cash in my pocket and my uncle sent another $25,000 when I was over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In London, Rempel met some people and handed over the $10,000.</p>
<p>They met Rempel the next day with a suitcase. They said it had $10.6 million in shrink-wrapped U.S. bills. Rempel wanted more proof. His new friends pulled out one bill and &#8220;cleansed&#8221; it with a liquid &#8220;formula,&#8221; which washed off some kind of stamp. Rempel was told that process made the money &#8220;legal tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like holy crap, is that mine?&#8221; he said. &#8220;They said &#8216;yes sir, it&rsquo;s yours.&rsquo; It all sounded legit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rempel returned to his hotel room clutching the formula and waited for the others so they could cleanse all his money. They never showed, and later told him they got held up. In the meantime, Rempel dropped the formula. The bottle broke. He called his contact who said he&rsquo;d get more. Rempel returned to Leamington and waited.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Rempel got a call. They found more formula. It would cost $120,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, &#8216;let&rsquo;s work on it, nothing is impossible,&rsquo;&#8221; said Rempel.</p>
<p>His contacts were willing to meet associates in different countries to get cash for the formula. It would require several plane tickets, worth $6,000 each.</p>
<p>Rempel was told they collected $100,000, but still needed $20,000. There was a guy in Nigeria who had it, but another plane ticket was required. The contact later told him he could only get $15,000 and &#8220;begged&#8221; Rempel for the last $5,000.</p>
<p>Rempel borrowed money. He stopped making Visa and car payments.</p>
<p>They called a week later and said the money was ready to go. They just needed $6,900 for travel costs and to rent trunks to ship the money.</p>
<p>Later, the men called to say they were at the airport in New York. Security stopped them and they needed $12,500 for a bribe. Finally, Rempel had enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;no way I&rsquo;m cleaned out.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rempel, his parents and 10-year-old brother Ike drove to New York. They spent a day searching the airport for the men, with no luck. They returned home and called police.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really thought in my heart this was true,&#8221; said Rempel.</p>

			<p>John Rempel does not watch enough documentary television.It is a good source of information about these kinds of scams.And something tells me that he doesnt know anything about blacks in general.It looks like his relatives have the same kind of brain genes that he does.</p>

			<p>What surprises me are the very high caliber and credibility of people, ones that you think would know better, who have been victims of these 419 scams.</p>
<p>Excuseologists for these scammers say that the victims are as much to blame as the perps, however, the scammers don&rsquo;t say, imply, or even propose anything that&rsquo;s illegal.</p>

<p>When I get those silly spams from Nigerians and others I ask myself who is so stupid as to be fooled by some obviously stupid black with a story that is so pitifully lacking in any kind of cleverness it comes across as total nonsense.  Well, this story answers that question.  What a pitiful individual to allow himself to be taken in by such stupid, obviously false stories.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe that anybody would fall for such nonsense, even after reading this.</p>

			<p>The way of nature is sometimes brutal.</p>
<p>But the slow antelopes get eaten by the lion.</p>
<p>The slow White dude gets taken by the Nigerians.</p>
<p>I have no sympathy, none whatsoever (well, maybe a little).</p>
<p>&#8216;Tis a pity!</p>
<p>Look at it this way, Rempel, your purpose in life is now to serve as a bright, shining beacon, warning other White people.</p>
<p>Maybe that was your purpose from the beginning.</p>
<p>You shall do your job splendidly.<br/>

			<p>   This man&rsquo;s greed and lust for free money was his worst enemy. I can&rsquo;t feel sorry for somebody who falls victim to such a stupid scam. &#8220;Money for nothing&#8221; is always a hoax. He should have known better as should all the people whom loaned him money. I bet he doesn&rsquo;t do it again. </p>

			<p>Horrible thing to happen to such a young man. The psychology of these scams are not only the money, but the lack of closure if one stops halfway. </p>
<p>If only I have them another $2,000, I will have the money, I cant very well stop now that Ive already spent $5,000! If&hellip;if&hellip;if&hellip;</p>
<p>Just sad.</p>

			<p>A product of diversity indoctrination and socialism; even his family believed.  Its really no different than our own government, promising nirvana if we just be patriotic and pay a little more.  Most white Americans are repulsed by our movement, and claim intellectual superiority over &#8220;racist&#8221; like us, yet they are ripped off.</p>

OK, I kind of get how one&rsquo;s greed could blind a person like this, kind of.</p>
<p>But how on earth did he convince numerous relatives to join him?  Haven&rsquo;t we all heard a million warnings about scams like this?  Especially with the internet.  I must get several of these emails everyday, as I am sure everyone does.  How do you fall for this?</p>

			<p>A $12 million inheritance delivered in cash? </p>
<p>A magic formula that costs $120,000 to make cash into legal tender?</p>
<p>There were several HUNDRED red flags here that screamed fraud. </p>
<p>Sorry, I have news for all of you:</p>
<p>what these stories really prove is that sometimes, the black guy is a hell of a lot smarter than the white guy.</p>
<p>Being distrustful of black people won&rsquo;t help either: you&rsquo;ll be taken by a Bulgarian fraudster.</p>

			<p>I used to live in South Africa until we escaped in 1999.  There are now plenty of Nigerians living in the cities now, the acknowledged drug dealers. In the Apartheid days, they would have been kicked out PDQ.   We had reports of some SA citizens in the old day who fell for this scam when it first started, where one or two went to Nigeria to chase the fraudsters.  They never returned.  The Nigerians have turned a potentially rich country (lot of oil) into a hell-hole with two religions fighting Christianity and Islam, and the main other export is crime.  The 419 scam (so called because that is the reference number of the fraud in the Nigerian Penal Code book, is an old one.  I have friends who have pretended to go along with it and played games wasting their time but they can be very dangerous to mess with.  Most Africans have no respect for life.</p>

			<p>   I used to get two or three emails from Nigerian confidence men every week. It certainly says a lot for the depth of liberal brainwashing that so many whites fall for these outrageous swindles. Maybe, it&rsquo;s greed  &mdash;  wanting something for nothing. Certainly, no avid reader of the AR website would fall for these crude swindles.</p>

			<p>I remember - very vividly - that ecstatic moment when I read the incoming e-mail telling me I&rsquo;d won a competition / lottery I certainly didn&rsquo;t quite remember entering. Actually, I STILL get their e-mailings: it&rsquo;s called FREE LOTTO.</p>
<p>The euphoria lasted just long enough for me to draw breath to scream the marvelous news to my wife - but something stayed the yell.</p>
<p>After about ten seconds my brain started working properly again.</p>
<p>I realized that the spelling and grammar were odd and that the missive simply &#8216;read&rsquo; wrong.</p>
<p>My heart truly goes out to John Rempel, the simple gullible innocent; in an earlier age he&rsquo;d have asked advice of someone smarter and more knowledgeable in the ways of the world, like a minister of religion or the village schoolteacher.</p>
<p>In Britain there was a well-reported suicide as a result of just this kind of Nigerian scam. The man who chose to take his own life - a college lecturer - was about 20,000 pounds down and would have survived the financial loss in time, but he felt - according to the widow who read his suicide note - that he&rsquo;d be regarded with unendurable contempt and ridicule forever.</p>

			<p>The first time I got one of these letters I wondered why an international banker or lawyer would write or have a secretary who wrote at a 4th grade level. That alone was enough to make me pause. I asked a fellow student at the little community college where I was taking a class. She told me, &#8220;Oh, everybody gets those things all the time. They are some sort of scam.&#8221; The next day she happened to get one herself, and showed it to me. It was eerily similar, including grammer and punctuation mistakes. That was enough for me. How could this young man be taken in by this? I am sorry for him, but are Canadian youngsters really so lacking in language skills that they are not alerted by the sheer crudity of these scams? Aren&rsquo;t they taught that there is no free lunch and that you don&rsquo;t get something for nothing? I guess P.T. Barnum was right when he said there&rsquo;s a sucker born every minute.He should have added that they are usually white. </p>

I have forwarded the information to the United State Secret Service - Financial Crimes Division&#8221; I do in fact send copies of the email to the USSS - they are interesting in these frauds.</p>

			<p>I got one of those scams.  It was titled Burton family fortune.<br/>
Since my last name is Burton, I opened it up.  It was allegedly from a London attorney about the fortune.  Since the attorney had an african name and described himself as a barrister rather than a solicitor, I deleted the message, knowing who it was from.<br/>

			<p>To Tom Iron:</p>
<p>How true!  That adage still rings true across the span of decades.  It bears repeating in its entirety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never smarten up a chump, educate a mark and I never give a sucker an even break.  Remember: you can&rsquo;t cheat an honest man.&#8221; - William Claude Dukenfeld (aka W.C. Fields).</p>
<p>After seeing John Rempel&rsquo;s photo, I&rsquo;m reminded of a similar saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are so simple of mind, and so easily dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty ready to be deceived.&#8221; - Niccolo Machiavelli: The Prince.</p>
<p>When I was growing up my father impressed upon me REPEATEDLY that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.  Let&rsquo;s be honest, though.  We&rsquo;ve all been victims of little scams at one time or another in our lives.  Anyone who gets taken in by something of this magnitude, though, deserves no pity.</p>

			<p>Question diversity is not correct. The entire Nigerian scam is illegal down to the last letter. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;fraudulent inducement.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not real happy about blaming the victims for this sort of thing. Even if I thought I could con a total idiot with a ridiculous and preposterous scam, and then blame him for falling for it while excusing away my criminality, I would not do it. Of course, I&rsquo;m White, I&rsquo;m a good person and I&rsquo;m not a criminal (those 3 things go together). </p>
<p>Bottom line is criminals are criminals. No point blaming the victim.</p>
<p>I run a Yahoo group for victims of the &#8220;romance scam&#8221; or &#8220;lonely hearts scam.&#8221; The # of people who fall for this one is simply astounding - it&rsquo;s an epidemic. A very large number of the scammers come from West Africa, especially Nigeria. Others come out of Russia and now the Philippines.</p>
<p>I got to know Nigeria inside out in the course of running this Yahoo group. Southern Nigerian large cities have to be the epicenter of criminality on the planet. I am convinced that 50% of the population of Lagos wakes up every day and says, &#8220;Who can I rip off today?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip; Why are so many Americans sold on getting rich without having to work for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by SG at 9:06 AM on January 15 </p>
<p>Because America has become Scamerica.  Just look at the internet and real estate scams.  Look at Madoff and all those FCC people.  When money is the only ethic, nothing is sacred.  Look at how advertising itself has become scam-like.  Here&rsquo;s a pill to make you a man, here&rsquo;s pill to make sure you remain a man, here&rsquo;s a pill to make sure she know&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re a man&hellip;.  Here&rsquo;s your new insurance policy - that&rsquo;s your new deductable.  We are being scammed on every level everyday.</p>
<p>Resist - just say no (more).<br/>
