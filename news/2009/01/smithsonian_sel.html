<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/30/and-then-there-were-six/">Smithsonian Selects Finalists for African-American Museum</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah K. Dietsch, Washington Times, January 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Museum of African American History and Culture, to be constructed on Constitution Avenue near the Washington Monument, may turn out to be a stony sculptural edifice or a glass-faced building framed in steel.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution announced Thursday that it has narrowed the list of 22 firms competing for the museum commission to six finalists with diverse outlooks on design.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve all demonstrated a passion for African-American culture,&#8221; museum director Lonnie Bunch said at a press briefing yesterday. &#8220;They have the skills to help us craft a structure that will enhance the National Mall.&#8221;</p>
<p>All six teams include black design principals, and four firms are members of the National Organization of Minority Architects. Several are led by architects experienced in designing museums and institutions in Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Architect Philip Freelon of Durham, N.C., designed the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture in Baltimore and the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco. New York-based Max Bond is the architect behind the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
<p>This team may have a leg up in the two-month-long competition. In 2007, Mr. Freelon and Mr. Bond were hired by the Smithsonian to come up with a conceptual framework for the 300,000- to 350,000-square-foot museum on the Mall.</p>
<p>The six teams of finalists will base their designs for the museum on these preliminary plans. Each group will be paid a stipend of $50,000 to develop its final vision.</p>
<p>The submitted proposals will be judged by a panel of museum officials, architects and other experts from April 1 through 3. Mr. Bunch, who is one of the 11 jurors, said he is looking for a &#8220;signature green building&#8221; that &#8220;speaks about the resiliency, optimism and spirituality of the African-American experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Smithsonian obviously does not want to repeat its experiences with the National Museum of the American Indian; disagreements over its construction led to the removal of the design architect.</p>
<p>After being selected, the winning team will spend the next few years developing the design of the $500 million black-history museum, which is scheduled to open in 2015. Renderings of all six competition schemes will be exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution Building  &mdash;  popularly known as &#8220;the Castle&#8221;  &mdash;  this spring.<br>

			<p>I predict that after the museum opens in 80% black D.C., you will be able to go in there any day of the week and not find a single black person browsing the exhibits.</p>

			<p>Now we can take the rest of the museum and move it into the white smithsonian.  We can start with the Wright Bros. plane, the Apollo lunar capsule, and all of Thomas Edison&rsquo;s inventions.  </p>

			<p>300,000 sq.ft. for a blak history museum? well I guess when you are allowed to make up your history as you go, you may need the extra space. I wonder where they will display the Apollo 11 capsule?</p>

			<p>I remember when they opened up the Smithsonian European American Museam. Oh wait, never mind. That was something I saw after a few too many Bourbons. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Celebrating &ldquo;the resiliency, optimism and spirituality of the African-American experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And please, let&rsquo;s not forget to include exhibits celebrsting that well-known tendency of Blacks to turn to criminal behavior, not just in America, but all over the world&hellip; wherever they are, INCLUDING in Africa and the formerly White European nations. I mean surely, shouldn&rsquo;t this magnificent exhibit tell the WHOLE TRUTH?</p>

<p>The only good thing I can think of about this museum is at least it isn&rsquo;t going to be built on the grounds of, or as an addition to, the iconic Smithsonian building itself, although with the way whites are falling over each other to glorify the black race, I&rsquo;m surprised it isn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>I know that in Gary Indiana there have been plans to build an African-American museum for decades, spearheaded by former mayor Richard G. Hatcher, but the money has been, as usual, mishandled (of course, locating the museum in one of the numerous abandoned buildings currently in Gary was never good enough for the esteemed Mr. Hatcher). But couldn&rsquo;t one think of the entire city of Gary itself as a &#8220;museum of African-American culture?&#8221;  Needless to say, this museum in Washington is going to be built with WPM, that is, White People&rsquo;s Money. </p>
<p>And as far as the smarmy statement quoted above, I have never known blacks to be particularly optimistic about anything, except that they would &#8220;overcome&#8221; in the hazy, far off future. Certainly, saying that all their problems are due to white oppression and are largely out of their hands doesn&rsquo;t sound particularly optimistic to me.</p>

I&rsquo;m curious about what claims they&rsquo;re going to make concerning black inventions. They certainly can&rsquo;t make the outrageous statements such as a black man invented the elevator or the refrigerator. To do so would make the museum an easy target. Not to make such claims will infuriate afro-centric blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be like walking the razors edge.</p>

Not true&hellip;the DC government schools will bus the kids there, and the place will be filled with black youngsters who will proceed to trash the facility.  I my town we have a &#8220;science center.&#8221;  I went there once, but the minority kids there of field trips were so out of control I made a point to never return. </p>

			<p>My local library dragged out the Black History displays and books the week after New Year&rsquo;s.  Black history month is not just February.  It starte about January 5th and goes on until around March 20th, especially in the schools.</p>

			<p>Has anyone seen the Piquot (sp?) Indian museum in Conn.? The life like settings in the museum depict Indians as one would imagine them, mostly caucasian and attractive. Meanwhile!! photos of current Piquot Indians looks more like a welfare line in front of a mobile home, blacks only.</p>

			<p>A museum of 350,000 square feet would seem excessive to display the artifacts of black history.  I mean, how much room would be needed to display the spear, do-rag, an old jar of Georgia Peach Pomade, a Fifties-era Buick Roadmaster, a grass hut, the boom-box, a roach-clip, and a 64 oz. bottle of Night Train.</p>
<p>I believe that hits most of the high points.</p>

<p>Geez! Maybe the fact Blacks have no REAL HISTORY&hellip; has something to do with it. I mean when all your history shows is 45,000 to 50,000 years of racial non-achievement, you have to restort to endlessly re-iterrated fiction to make up the deficit.</p>
<p>Getting down to hard reality&hellip; can ANYONE come up with some geniuine Black invention that HAS NOT depended on many years of White research, White generated knowledge. I mean like that fountain pen&hellip; hyped up as a Black invention. Never mind that others formulated the understanding of pneumatics, capillary action, invention of rubber-making, plastics, etc., without which the concept of a fountain pen would have been useless. Bottom line is while Europe started its long climb upward, beginning with the Golden Age of Greek thinkers, progressing through feudalism, the Middle Ages, and culminating with the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath, Blacks cannot HONESTLY point to anything even remotely similar. But remember, if anyone dares to point that out, cries of &#8220;RACIST&#8221; fill the air!</p>
<p>Blacks in Africa have had DECADES since the end of Colonialism, yet the Continent still is a mass of crime, corruption, disease, poverty and despair. Wondering if Black History teachers have the moral courage to address THAT issue&hellip; WITHOUT trying to pin the blame on Evil Whites!</p>
