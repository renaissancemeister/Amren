<h1><a href="https://catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14730">Birth Control Pill Inventor Laments Demographic &#8216;Catastrophe&rsquo;</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chemist who made a key discovery leading to the invention of the birth control pill has written a commentary calling demographic decline in Europe a &#8220;horror scenario&#8221; and a &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; brought on in part by the pill&rsquo;s invention.</p>
<p>Mr. Carl Djerassi, now 85 years old, was one of three researchers whose formulation of the synthetic progestagen Norethisterone marked a key step in the creation of the first oral contraceptive pill, the Guardian reports.</p>
<p>In a personal commentary in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, Djerassi said his invention is partly to blame for demographic imbalance in Europe. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fall in the birth rate, he claimed, was an &#8220;epidemic&#8221; far worse but less highlighted than obesity. In his view, young Austrians who fail to procreate are committing national suicide.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to reverse the demographic decline, an &#8220;intelligent immigration policy&#8221; will be necessary, Djerassi said.</p>
<p>According to the Guardian, Archbishop of Vienna Cardinal Christoph Schonborn told Austrian TV that Pope Paul VI had predicted the pill would cause a dramatic fall in the birth rate.</p>

			<p>Mr. Djerassi strikes me as someone who used to be the kind of person who was worried about &#8220;overpopulation.&#8221;  So he does something about it, but the people that are doing something about it are mostly white.  Fast forward today, and overpopulation problems are starting to come to a head, but not thanks to whites.  Even though most people worried about it are white.</p>

			<p>Nothing wrong with oral contraceptives, they were simply provided to the wrong people. Instead of exporting the birth control pills to poor Third World (often Catholic or Muslim) countries, where exploding population growth is running into the usual Malthusian outcomes&hellip;.they were provided mostly to whites in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The population bomb is real. We simply must decide WHO will populate this world. If something is not done about the Third World population explosion and nothing is done about their surplus populations overwhelming Western Societies through immigration (legal and otherwise), then the article is correct&hellip;..we will have committed suicide.</p>

			<p>In 1970, while in High School in upstate New York, the Marxist teachers shoved &#8220;Zero Population Growth&#8221; down our collective throats.</p>
<p>The sky is falling, the sky is falling and if we don&rsquo;t achieve ZPG we will face Ecological Armageddon!!!</p>
<p>Of course, how many third world baby machines were listening in the prosperous ALL WHITE Vestal NY high school classes&hellip;NONE.</p>
<p>Later on, my university Commie professors were even more insistent that US honkies were over populating the world. As a result, even more ZPG propaganda got proliferated.</p>
<p>I never believed any of this Marxist dog-poo, and taught my WASP kids to go forth and multiply. Nowadays I have four fantastic, home-schooled grand baby boys who are being prepared to be pass through the inevitable fire of the US implosian and become the remnant of our European-American founding fathers. </p>
<p>My suggestion for all of the Amren readers is to..GO FORTH and MULTIPLY!!</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac has pinpointed the real crux of the overpopulation problem and I have to admit the solutions are not going to be pleasant, but they&rsquo;ll sooner or later have to be enacted one way or another.</p>
<p>We in the West are being swamped to death, literally.  </p>
<p>Drastic response is needed to resolve the Third World population population because if left unchecked, it is set to cause the extinction of indigenous white peoples not only in diaspora all over the world, but also within white homelands as well. </p>

			<p>Canadian demographics are similar for Whites, and for the same reasons (except for certain pockets here and there). There are, of course, many reasons behind the White, in this case, European demographic collapse. Having lived in Sweden for several years, these are some of my personal observations- They include: the loss of Christianity and the embrace of the athiest culture of death; toxic, family hating feminism; blind materialism (not having children would affect one&rsquo;s &#8220;lifestyle&#8221;); the postponment, sometimes permanent, of maturaty- ie: adulthood and it&rsquo;s responsabilities; and the embrace of Big Mommy-Goverment- soft tyranny, which relates to the aforementioned postponement of adulthood/maturity. I&rsquo;m sure there are other factors, perhaps many, but the common thread in all of this is an adoption of post-modernist left-wing worldview which in it&rsquo;s essence is narcissistic- the legacy of the baby-boom generation. The suicidal coup de grace is the importation by the monsterous EU of tens of millions of Muslims, Blacks and other third worlders who&rsquo;s birthrates are sometimes four times that of the native Whites, and who are not there to assimilate but to colonize. It&rsquo;s a death spiral.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;intelligent immigration policy&rdquo; will be necessary</i></p>
<p>This oxymoron belongs to the same category as &#8220;smart&#8221; give away of one&rsquo;s country to a foreign nation, or &#8220;intelligent&#8221; downsizing of one&rsquo;s home, car (you&rsquo;ve seen the Smart), and the amount of energy and natural resources one is allowed to use (for instance, in order to make more room for more Mexicans).</p>
<p>The guy doesn&rsquo;t seem to remember that one of the most prosperous and productive periods in history of Europe, the Renaissance, followed a sharp population drop caused by the plague. So, what is actually wrong with Austrians having less kids?</p>
<p>The only thing that Austrians must do in order to take full advantage of stabilizing or shrinking population is to not facilitate population growth of other ethnic and racial groups. If the others are poor then let them take birth control pills, period.</p>

			<p>There is indeed an overpopulation problem, which has serious environmental repercussions. We cant simply ignore this problem because it is an inconvenience to white nationalists worried about the demographic transition of The West. I share everyone else&rsquo;s concern about the future of ethnic Europeans, but racial preservation isn&rsquo;t the only issue everyone should be concerned about. We need to preserve our environment too. Trying to out-compete non-whites in procreation is not a very well thought out strategy and is completely monomaniacal in outlook. </p>

<p>BB - This statement could be interpreted as meaning whites should control their numbers to &#8220;save the world&#8221;.  I disagree with this line of reasoning.  What good would white birth control be if the other races aren&rsquo;t doing the same?  The world could end up severely overpopulated in another 75 or 100 years even if white populations continue to shrink.  I think you&rsquo;re buying into the whole comprehensive global warming (it&rsquo;s a myth), humans-are-harmful-to-the-earth, religio-cultist line of bull dung.  European governments since the end of WWII should have seen the demographic writing on the wall.  They should have had a program in place by 1950 offering European (white) families cash bonuses for every third, fourth and fifth child born.  Yes that&rsquo;s a case of &#8220;should have&#8221; but it&rsquo;s still a useful idea that could be implemented rather than waste money on other idiotic government programs currently practiced.  The EU&rsquo;s political correctness shamefully will have none of it.</p>

			<p>A quote from the article &#8220;Physical Decline of American Women&#8221; in &#8220;The Knickerbocker Magazine&#8221;, January 1860:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Children are so expensive; the demands of society, the cost for food, clothing, education is so great that we could not decently live with such a family.&rsquo; Another, with means in abundance, says, &#8216;That the care of children is such a slavery;&rsquo; this one is fond of show and company, that one intends to go to Europe, and neither can be &#8216;bothered with young ones.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>During the course of the 19th Century the number of births per women in the US declined from just under 8 children per woman in 1800 to less than 4 children per woman in 1900. </p>
<p>By 1900 the average urban native-born American woman had a birthrate below replacement level. Thus all the talk about &#8220;race suicide&#8221; in the early 20th Century.</p>
<p>The roots of our demographic disaster go back long before the invention of &#8220;The Pill.&#8221;</p>

			<p>On the news this morning is a story about how the Thai Navy towed a barge of Burmese refugees out to sea and left them.  This is brutal, but if the Thais are going to survive, they need to prevent foreign invasion, armed or unarmed.  I don&rsquo;t envy the Thai sailor&rsquo;s having to do the dirty work.  It would be much easier to sink an enemy warship that was shooting at you, but the result of millions of refugees is the same as millions of soldiers.  Prosperous Thais remember what poverty is, and know that they raised their own country by hard, intelligent work.  They&rsquo;re not about to hand it over.  <br>
     The UN or somebody is accusing the Thais of not acting in accord with &#8220;international standards&#8221;, which seems to mean allowing people from failing countries to enter and destroy successful ones.  I suppose the Thais will make some conciliatory noises, and increase their naval budget.  Around the world, countries are facing catastrophe.  A depression in the U.S. means famine in the many places that rely upon our imports or our charity.  There will be insufficient resources to attend to all the crises, epidemics, starvation, water shortages, tribal warfare, that envelop the world.  No more campaigns to raise money to help Africans with AIDS, no more &#8221; international&#8221; (White) efforts to rebuild houses after earthquakes in Mexico, no more wasting our limited resources on other nation&rsquo;s calamities.   Desperate people will struggle to survive and will be cruelly put down.  Gradually, massacres will cease to be news.  Welcome to the future.</p>

<p>You sound like a Marxist Liberal.  Are you one?</p>
<p>Firstly, white population depletion <b>is</b> the main issue and it needs to be dramatically increased because the overall white population of the world, is heading towards the point of extinction thanks to white Marxist Liberals and the perverted edicts leading to the destruction of the family unit such as feminism, homosexuality, paedophilia, drug experimentation, mass Third World immigration/asylum with its accompanying spread of AIDS/STDs and religious inspired terrorism all of which they&rsquo;ve forced upon the world.  </p>
<p>Secondly, the environment can only be protected by less non-white proliferation, ie, a drastic reduction in their out-of-control breeding habits.  <b>They</b> are the culprits responsible for over-population, after all.</p>
<p>If <b>you</b> want to preserve America&rsquo;s environment, that means returning at least 70 million non-whites back to their lands of origin.<br>

<p>My fine fellow, while I do not share your overarching concern for the environment&hellip;..to the point of suicide of our society&hellip;.I do agree with your statement. We do not need to get in a race to see who can out-reproduce the Third World. We would only end up imitating their foolish disregard.</p>
<p>What we desperately need to do is isolate and quarantine those countries that are experiencing a population explosion. This is the only way I can imagine to compel them to voluntarily control their own population. If they refuse, the usual Malthusian solutions will automatically kick in.</p>
<p>Western Society has already defused the population bomb in our lifetime&hellip;.now we need to protect that achievement by not allowing the Third World to dump tens of millions of their surplus population in our countries. Otherwise, all our success will be our own suicide. In regard to your own concerns, B.B., this will protect the environment now occupied by Western Society. There cannot be Open Borders and environmental protection (or conservation of our natural resources for future generations). </p>
<p>This would be a noble job for our military, much more noble than spreading democracy at bayonet point.</p>

<p>I disagree.  The problem with White societies worldwide isn&rsquo;t oral contraceptives.  By the way, birthrates among WASP-Americans (and probably Europeans) were already declining decades before the invention of &#8220;the pill.&#8221; (Teddy Roosevelt even tried to get his fellow Anglos to reverse this trend).</p>
<p><a href="https://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199711/20_smiths_fertility/part1/f4.shtml" rel="nofollow">https://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199711/20_smiths_fertility/part1/f4.shtml</a></p>
<p>Contraceptives such as &#8220;the pill&#8221; can be a useful tool in a healthy society that practices eugenics on a national scale.  Do you want to simply ban birth control outright?  Have you thought about the consequences of such an act?  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0052.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0052.htm</a></p>
<p>Even if you could somehow kick every non-White out of this country (and keep them out), do you really want low-IQ Whites outbreeding their betters?  What would you have here in 200 years?</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/sailer/050410_ruin.htm</p>
<p>No, you and Mr. Djerassi are wrong.  There is a place for oral contraceptives in a healthy society.  Such a society encourages the better members of its better stocks to breed at the (humane) expense of the rest.  Society overall would only benefit from such a policy in the long run.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ablest race of whom history bears record is unquestionably the ancient Greek, partly because their master-pieces in the principal departments of intellectual activity are still unsurpassed, and in many respects unequalled, and partly because the population that gave birth to the creators of these master-pieces was very small&hellip; Athens opened her arms to immigrants, but not indiscriminately, for her social life was such that none but very able men could take any pleasure in it; on the other hand, she offered attractions such as men of the highest ability and culture could find in no other city. Thus, by a system of partly unconscious selection, she built up a magnificent breed of human animals&hellip;&#8221;  -  Francis Galton: &#8220;Hereditary Genius.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I agree with B.B. but I would more specifically say whites should shoot for replacement level birth rates 2.1 babies per woman.  We do not need to outbreed everyone else simply we need to refuse to finance and enable the breeding of everyone else.<br>
i.e., the genocide of whites in Zimbabwe is tragic but the silver lining is the coming population implosion there. ..i.e, they killed the goose that laid the golden egg now they are starving.</p>
<p>So the most unracist things whites can do is to tell non-whites if you can&rsquo;t feed them don&rsquo;t breed them because there will be too many of you an not enough of us to make up the difference and you will blame us and kill us and still die anyway.</p>

			<p>Breed or die.  It&rsquo;s no more complicated than that.</p>
<p>If you think by holding down the white birthrate, the &#8220;environment&#8221; will be better, then you don&rsquo;t understand nature.  All you do by holding down the white birthrate is leave more room for non-whites to fill your lands with their kind, while your kind is in the old age homes and then the graveyards.</p>
<p>And, the supposed desire to breed for quality as some propose is a wrong headed approach to modern realities.  Breed for quantity and the quality will claw its way to the top.  </p>

			<p>This is excellent news. The birth control pill has been one of the most destructive and harmful inventions in human history. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if non-whites chose to use it, however history shows that the worst low IQ minorities either don&rsquo;t use it or don&rsquo;t use it consistently, while high IQ whites use it so as to limit their children below replacement levels! </p>
<p>A friend of mine&rsquo;s wife was friends with a woman who went to a third world country in south America to promote birth control, after a short time the natives began to use the condoms as decorations putting them on brooms and other things, anything but their intended purpose.</p>
<p>The pill is dysgenic. We can talk about who should or should not use it, but the reality is that low IQ races will always use it less and whites will always use it more. Despite all the hoopla for the last 40 years about educating minorities about contraception, whites have a lower birth rate and they still have a much higher birthrate. We would have been much better off had the pill never been invented. </p>
<p>Whites should have as many children as possible. Through contraception we are destroying our race. At the same time, we should have a eugenic program to discourage low IQ minorities from having children. Perhaps they can be compensated for undergoing sterilization. I would also favor the repatriation of non-whites to their countries of ancestral origin. Then if those third world countries become overpopulated nature will take care of it, provided we don&rsquo;t intervene. </p>
<p>Of course there are some whites who have hereditary medical conditions or very low IQs who perhaps should not reproduce, however they are a small minority of cases, and in my view it would be sterilization and not birth control pills which would be appropriate for those whites, since birth control can have a high failure rate, and harmful health effects. </p>
<p>Mr. Djerassi must never be forgiven for his role in creating the birth control pill no matter how much remorse he expresses, however his apology and regret is useful and important in itself. Hopefullly this will cause pro-birth control pill advocates to critically re-evaluate their position. </p>
<p>Margaret Singer founded the Birth Control League (later Planned Parenthood) in order to limit the numbers of non white births, and those of low IQ poor whites, how did that work out? Despite her noble intentions her plan completely back fired, her organization completely abandoned race realism.</p>

<p>Yes, and I believe that unlike these Thais, far too many in the West have forgotten hardship.  Memory of the past, of hardship and struggle may well be one of the keys to the survival of a society.  Has the West grown so accustomed to comfort and has complacency set in? Perhaps, and when combined with the relentless guilt trips about our &#8216;evil&rsquo; past and the promotion of moral decay (enabled by the pill) is foisted on us by hard core Leftists, many Westerners seem set move to the next phase of civilisational decline - apathy. Look at Britain, self-destructing and few seem to care. Here&rsquo;s what Lee Harris has to say about the consequence of forgeting hardship in Civilisation and it&rsquo;s Enemies:<br>
 <br>
  &#8216;Forgetfulness occurs when those who have been long accustomed to civilized order can no longer remember a time in which they had to wonder whether their crops would grow to maturity without being stolen or whether their children would be sold into slavery by a victorious foe. Even then it is necessary for parents, and even grandparents, to have forgotten as well, so that there is no living link between the tranquility of the present generation and those dismal periods in which the world behaved very much in accordance with the rules governing Thomas Hobbes&rsquo; state of nature, where human life was &ldquo;solitary, poore, nasty, brutish and short.&rdquo; When parents have forgotten what that world was like, they can hardly be expected to teach their children how it was or what one had to do in order to survive in it&rsquo;.</p>

I always find your comments to &#8216;on the nose&rsquo;.<br>
And the scenario you described with the Thai navy reminded me of the often mentioned &#8216;Camp of the saints&rsquo; book (I&rsquo;ve only read the JT review).<br>
Interestingly on the subject of the West having to withhold international aid and letting natural selection do it&rsquo;s job in Africa. Kenya specially has it&rsquo;s begging bowl out at the moment saying they need urgent aid now! Interesting Timing.<br>
Kenyans favorite son is going to have a decision to make either before or after his $200m party (it will be in someone else&rsquo;s name of course).<br>
Maybe they&rsquo;re trying to fill the coffers before the West goes broke.</p>

<p>&#8216;Something has to give&rsquo; globally in the next twenty years or so.<br>
China has 1.3 billion single children with no brothers or sisters, uncles, aunties, cousins etc.<br>
India is a patrilocal society that has had to have ultrasound sex determination technology outlawed for the last twenty years due to female deselection abortions, but they still have a ratio of 899 girls born per 1000 boys, and their birth rates in the north are still 7 child born per female, compared to Africa&rsquo;s 9 per woman, and this is in addition to something like 5 fetal births per woman as well.<br>
So both of these huge people producing continents have millions upon millions of &#8216;empty branches&rsquo;, angry men who&rsquo;ll die alone, woman less.<br>
I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the Muslim world(look at Indonesia for instances, we have too).<br>
And the world population over the last century has doubled every 33 years to it&rsquo;s current 6.5 billion. <br>
Here in Oz we thankfully only have 20 million &#8216;ish&rsquo; people.<br>
But we have virtually no water and we&rsquo;re going to evacuate neighboring Pacific Islanders here due to raising sea levels, which isn&rsquo;t that big a deal, but still.<br>
Up until recently our biggest social problems have been obesity, depression and probably our road toll.<br>
But our agricultural industry is dead, manufacturing has been shedding about 10% of it&rsquo;s total jobs annually for the last couple of years and our resources boom is now busting because when retailers stop selling globally, China stops making, so they stop ordering our minerals.<br>
The good thing about having only two kids, I think is it&rsquo;ll be easier to feed them at least.<br>
I know it&rsquo;s seemes very easy to casually type this from my PC, but death is a part of life and I can see a lot of global death  happening in the next few decades to balance things out.</p>

			<p>Whites have a fairly low tolerance for being crowded.  When crowded, nature works behind the scenes on whites to try to relive the crowding.  One thing that nature does is have whites move outward where there is more room. This is what happened when we were an expanding and not a contracting people. Those were the days of empire and colonies and all of that.  Whites ruled because we were expanding. Today we are contracting.</p>
<p>Another thing that nature does is cause wars.</p>
<p>Still another thing it does is have us curb our births. This is where we are today.  </p>
<p>The problem is that this &#8220;instinct&#8221; to curb our births is now harmful to our continued existence just as surely is the instict to play dead is for a possum in an age when that which is attacking it is an automobile, and not another animal whose own instincts keep it from eating something that is already supposedly dead.</p>
<p>By curbing our births, we are just leaving more room for other types of humans who don&rsquo;t mind the crowding. So, they move in and they have many children while we have few.  We aren&rsquo;t relieving the crowding by not having children, we are just going extinct and we&rsquo;re being replaced by people who are more vigorous than we are and who are more in tune with the laws of nature than we are.<br>

			<p>     Both points of view are correct-one is the ideal and the<br>
other strategic. Ideally, our women don&rsquo;t have to have ten kids<br>
per-with modern medicine, most survive and we would merely over-<br>
populate and lower our quality of life. But now, since we have<br>
opened our borders, our ideal doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. We blew it;<br>
it&rsquo;s out of our hands. Now we have to compete with high breeders<br>
who know nothing about quality of life and care even less. Now<br>
we have to struggle and &#8220;claw our way to the top&#8221;. It need not<br>
have been-we could have improved our Race with Eugenics, both<br>
positive and humanely negative.</p>

			<p>Margaret Singer founded the Birth Control League (later Planned Parenthood) in order to limit the numbers of non white births, and those of low IQ poor whites, how did that work out? <br>

<p>Also I should have written in my earlier post &#8220;something like 5 fetal &#8216;Deaths&rsquo; per woman&#8221;(not births).<br>
And I need to add to&hellip;<br>

<p>I meant compared to Northern hemisphere problems, though my stance is for Australia to be 100% white, no one seems to be listening to me so far. And the numbers I&rsquo;m talking about are a couple of hundred thousand people, which we&rsquo;ll take as opposed to let drown. I probably sound liberal, but I&rsquo;m more so trying to be realistic.<br>
Compared to 50 million African Immigrants to Europe, your Mexican invasion and your embedded problem. It&rsquo;s small potato&rsquo;s. <br>
I may sound flippant, but if something is inevitable and frankly out of my control I&rsquo;m not going to lose sleep over it.<br>
Importing African and Muslim refugees/immigrants are more pressing problems we have and also avoidable.</p>

			<p>The reason that so many Africans and Arabs and Turks have moved into Europe is to get out of their lives in their respective geographical corners, as Bulgaria as we know from that famous artist&rsquo;s rendering is known as &#8220;the Turkish Toilet.&#8221;  Most of Europe, the cradle of 18th through 20th Century century civilization, allowed the great United States to be the great European man&rsquo;s refuge up until the 1960&rsquo;s.  With the meteoric rise of America, and the great revisionism preached in higher learning now, America reached into the West where there were actually relatively few Mexicans and some Indians (like the Ojibway, sought the comfort of camps of the white man) and the fiery Scots-Irish colonized California all the way to Texas.  Now, we are being invaded, and they war has been declared.</p>

			<p>I am very much pro-environment.  It isn&rsquo;t grizzly bears and spotted owls that are ruining my neighborhood.  I don&rsquo;t see it as a bad thing if a white country has below replacement fertility for a while, although eventually birth rates will have to come back up to stabilize the population.  If a country has lower birth rates and keeps its borders closed the resulting &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; forces wages of working people up and reduces economic inequality.  The problem is that whenever this happens an unholy alliance of anti-white Marxists and cheap labor businessmen get together to open up the immigration floodgates.  The result is that having environmentally responsible birth rates becomes a sucker&rsquo;s game   &mdash;   people with low birth rates simply get replaced by people who don&rsquo;t.  Countries with high birth rates are able to externalize their costs by shipping the surplus to foolish Western countries.<br>

			<p>&#8220;European governments since the end of WWII should have seen the demographic writing on the wall. They should have had a program in place by 1950 offering European (white) families cash bonuses for every third, fourth and fifth child born. &#8220;<br>
Posted by Cherusci<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>France was already aware of its demographic  decline,  and its leaders lamented the paucity of babies even at the beginning of the 20th Century.  Of course, this was followed by the catastrophic loss of population in the First WW, and then still more in WW2. The government offered cash incentives in various forms (such as  &#8220;large family&#8221; discounts on the Paris subway and the railways) but these did not seem to be enough incentive to  the white population.  Ironically, now they now mostly stimulate the African immigrants to breed more.  Hardly the original intent!   (Or was it? The Marxists certainly don&rsquo;t mind.)</p>
<p>There can be other incentives too, besides money.   Old Spain, with a worldwide empire to manage and populate, had the noble title of <i> &#8220;Hidalgo de la Bragueta&#8221;  </i>&hellip; quite literally, Lord of the Fly  (this was not a dirty word).  A man who fathered, within marriage, seven sons in succession, became a nobleman, a Lord of the Fly.   It cost the state nothing, and no doubt this was a strong incentive for many to go for the prize, although  I&rsquo;m sure the odds against seven sons in succession were extremely high.  (Any mathematicians out there?)<br>

			<p>There&rsquo;s nothing bad about the BC pill. The pill is one of the greatest inventions ever. The way to make people have children is not by leaving them no choice or forcing them to be stuck with unwanted kids. We see how &#8220;well&#8221; lack of BC methods works in 3ed world countries. <br>
Europeans and westerners aren&rsquo;t having kids not because of BC options. They aren&rsquo;t having kids because they are spoiled, narcissistic, egotistic. They want to &#8220;have fun&#8221; and not be responsible for anyone. They are concentrated on their pleasures and don&rsquo;t want anyone or anything spoiling their good, carefree life.</p>

			<p>Whites would have plenty of babies if we were not being taxed to death.  Unlike others, whites tend to pay their bills and pay their taxes. More and more, there is no money left over for little luxuries like families. For those of us who pay our own way, an extra baby, or even one baby, is often simply out of the question.  These days, everything in life costs gobs of money, and the income needed to pay for it all is taxed at absurdly high rates.</p>
<p>In any case, a slightly declining white population would not be a problem if non-whites were not allowed to pour into the white world to &#8216;replace&rsquo; us.  Let them starve and die in the hells they&rsquo;ve created with their irresponsible reproductive habits.  They have no right to come in and take our world away from us.</p>

			<p>gwh at 7:04 PM on January 18: The probability of having a boy is 1 out of 2, or 1/2.  Each successive birth also has a probability of producing a boy 1/2 of the time.  So, the probability of producing two boys in succession is 1/2 X 1/2, which equals 1/4.  And the probability of producing seven sons in a row is 1/2 to the 7th power, which is 1/128.  <br>
     The downside for Spain in encouraging people to have lots of sons is that there won&rsquo;t be enough women for them all, which, unless you send the excess men off to fight and die somewhere, means a lot of social disruption in the next generation.  It&rsquo;s not simply a matter of that one family out of 128 that has seven sons and no daughters.  The incentive is to keep having kids until you have a girl, so there will tend to be a lot of families with three boys and one girl or five boys and one girl.  If the idea was to increase population in order to strengthen Spain, it was bad policy.  To be biological about it, fertile females are more valuable that virile males.  A theoretical island with one male and 50 females can double its population in one year.  Leaving aside the matter of inbreeding, this theoretical island will restore its gender balance within a generation.  Population growth is limited by the number of available wombs, which is why a patriotic man will sacrifice his life to save a fertile female of his nation.  Sacrificing himself to save an old woman merely makes him a gentleman.  </p>

<p>&#8220;The guy doesn&rsquo;t seem to remember that one of the most prosperous and productive periods in history of Europe, the Renaissance, followed a sharp population drop caused by the plague. So, what is actually wrong with Austrians having less kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>Population decline due to a drop in the birthrate and population decline due to disease epidemics are two different things.</p>
<p>In the latter case, many evolutionary psychologists believe the plagues (there were more than one) that ravaged Europe from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries (termed &#8220;bottlenecking events&#8221; by population geneticists) may have had a hand in the Renaissance, but not in the way you apparently think.</p>
<p>IQ is KNOWN to correlate positively with a number of healthy traits in humans (read &#8220;The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability&#8221; by Arthur Jensen, 1998, for the list and documentation).  The logic is the plagues selected those individuals who possessed these traits for survival, thus insuring the survival and proliferation of correlate genes for higher intelligence.  It is also known that intelligent people are far more likely to take the steps necessary (at least subconsciously) to avoid contracting illness.  Consider the following, written during the time of &#8220;The Black Death&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;(T)here were those who thought that to live temperately and avoid all excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of this kind. Wherefore they banded together, and dissociating themselves from all others, formed communities in houses where there were no sick, and lived a separate and secluded life, which they regulated with the utmost care, avoiding every kind of luxury, but eating and drinking moderately of the most delicate viands and the finest wines, holding converse with none but one another, lest tidings of sickness or death should reach them, and diverting their minds with music and such other delights as they could devise.&#8221; - Giovanni Boccaccio: &#8220;Decameron.&#8221; c. 1352.</p>
<p>If all this is true (and it probably is), then the effects of the plagues (for all their horrors) were net eugenic.  Since it is widely known that higher-IQ people have far fewer children than lower-IQ ones (in large part thanks to the Welfare State), the effect of a declining birthrate is net dysgenic.  That is the fundamental difference between the two.</p>

<p>No, that is a false dychotomy. The third, and preferred I propose, option is to keep the other groups under stringent birth control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like with stealing. It seems more rational to not let others steal than to out-steal them, never mind letting them steal as much as they want to, hoping that they change.</p>

			<p>ghw, by my calculation, the odds of having seven sons in succession are about one in 128.</p>
<p>Just multiply 0.5 (the odds of having a boy in any given pregnancy) by itself six times (once for each additional pregnancy).  This gives you an answer of 0.0078125.  The reciprocal of that number, 128, gives you the odds. </p>

			<p>Actually Europe&rsquo;s population has been subject to big swings. About an entire third was wiped out in just a few short years during the black death. But it recoveerd. The key is to keep out Non-Whites to allow time for the recovery. </p>

			<p>One commentator on here tries to justify a low white birthrate with a transparently false analogy. In his view we shouldn&rsquo;t try to out breed other peoples because, in his view, that would be like trying to out steal thieves.</p>
<p>Do I really need to point out how illogical that argument is other than to say that sounds a little like someone whistling past the grave yard?</p>
<p>Forget all the &#8220;fine&#8221; points of the arguments.  The fact is that all of nature screams out: EXPAND.  And, all of nature has set forth a competition to have your kind (whether we&rsquo;re talking about people, trees or individual genes)be the dominant kind.  And, to be the dominant kind, one needs sheer numbers of your kind and fewer numbers of any other kind that fills the same niche.</p>

<p>Breed or die. It&rsquo;s no more complicated than that.</p>
<p>If you think by holding down the white birthrate, the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; will be better, then you don&rsquo;t understand nature. All you do by holding down the white birthrate is leave more room for non-whites to fill your lands with their kind, while your kind is in the old age homes and then the graveyards.</p>
<p>And, the supposed desire to breed for quality as some propose is a wrong headed approach to modern realities. Breed for quantity and the quality will claw its way to the top.</p>

<p>And I agree with you too. The further problem with that is that (as we&rsquo;ve seen) the children of the slaves and servants do not want to remain slaves and servants.  They want to be <i>you </i> and to have what<i> you  </i>have.  What do you do then?  The answer thus far seems to be: &#8220;Appease them&#8221;.  Just look at France. Look at the USA.

Do you honestly believe that Western politicians won&rsquo;t import greater numbers of third-world aliens to counter any escalating white birthrate?

			<p>To Anonymous at 2:03 PM:  Whites don&rsquo;t have to outbreed the whole Third World.  They just need to breed so that their traditional lands  &mdash;  lands where they were once isolated and to which they are genetically adapted  &mdash;  are so full of Whites that White life, itself, will act as a physical, economic and psychological barrier against others coming in.  You can only fit so much of anything in a ten pound bag.  Right now,Whites aren&rsquo;t filling that bag and that leaves a void which nature is filling with others.</p>

<p>Posted by John at 7:04 PM on January 18 </p>
<p>There are much more complicated factors that are going into all of this than people realize.  </p>
<p>One person pointed out the huge amount of money we have to pay in taxes.  Why is that?  So we can support non-whites, that&rsquo;s why.  I live next to section 8 housing, and work from home.  These blacks next door never go to work and are up at all hours of the morning, dealing their drugs.  My bedroom is unfortunately on the same side as their house, and I hear knocking on the door at 2, 3 A.M. almost every night.  The cops won&rsquo;t do anything&hellip;they&rsquo;ve been out several times.  It gets quiet for a while, then reverts back to normal.  They practically live outside, too (I live in FL.).  </p>
<p>Another thing that I wanted to touch upon is the moral decline of our society.  I am female and was molested by a male member of my family as a child.  I have been researching this and it seems like this is a problem that is increasing in our society, and is generational, handed down from generation to generation.  Many people who were molested are so messed up, that they have mental, emotional, and spiritual problems for the rest of their lives.  A lot of them turn to homosexuality, especially if they were molested by a same gender person.  I am pretty lucky in that I am not as messed up as some, but I have had relationship problems my entire adult life, was married, now divorced; I do not have any children although I wanted them very much. Now it&rsquo;s almost too late, and I am too picky&hellip;my standards are very high.  I can&rsquo;t help it&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been in too many bad relationships, and would rather be alone than with someone who doesn&rsquo;t meet my standards.</p>
<p>So, this is one factor that hasn&rsquo;t been touched upon.  We need to stop the child molestation and become healthy adults, who respect one another in order to have successful relationships and marriages.</p>

The answer is no.  But that&rsquo;s not even necessary. There&rsquo;s no need (or reason) to compete with the entire third world.  Just sustain our own numbeers RIGHT HERE  in our own countries, keeping others out. As for those other countries, let them breed irresponsibly all they want, over THERE,  but let them  stew in their own juice and not come here!</p>
<p>You say that &#8220;we should reduce the numbers of imported third-world aliens. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&#8221;   I agree that we should reduce those numbers or better yet, eliminate them by ending immigration entirely. But I don&rsquo;t agree that it will be &#8220;easy&#8221;, since you say yourself that we are &#8220;targeted for genocide by our own treasonous governments&#8221; and politicians.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your &#8220;easy&#8221; solution to that dilemma?<br>

			<p>Fact is, there will be no curbing of immigration, no sending them back&hellip; as long as Obama is in the White house. </p>
<p>And one of his first priorities is stem cell research and giving millions for abortion aid.  Women will be selling fetuses for stem cell research, just wait and see.</p>
<p>Fed coffers to be opened for worldwide abortions<br>

<p>So the way I see it, the only answer is to have more children, remove your children from Marxist indoctrination schools and do not let them go to major colleges, because that is where all hell breaks lose&hellip;sex, drugs and alcohol, in addition to the Commie professors putting their sick ideas into students heads.</p>
