<h1>Hockey Player Says Burnaby Fight Was Religiously Motivated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News, January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Izaiah Buksh is suffering from bruises and will need to undergo a root canal after what he says was a religiously charged fight that broke out at a ball hockey tournament in Burnaby, B.C., on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old, who was playing in the B.C. Muslim Sports Association-sponsored event, said he was warned not to play in the tournament because, though he&rsquo;s a Muslim, he is not a Sunni.</p>
<p>The mood of the game turned tense early on when his team took an early lead. Buksh said the opposing team, made up of Sunni Muslims, told him, &#8220;You guys shouldn&rsquo;t even be here. You&rsquo;re not Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violence ultimately escalated after a play where the opposing goalie swung his stick at Buksh.</p>
<p>Buksh said he went to tell the referee, and when he turned around, he was attacked by a player.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the fight broke out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another player on my team came in and then my dad and the coach came in. At the end, it was most of the gym to three or four guys,&#8221; Buksh recounted.</p>
<p>He estimates his group was outnumbered about 10 to one.</p>
<p>Buksh&rsquo;s father, Ahmed, said he feared for his son&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was basically a riot by that time and swarming  &mdash;  one of my sons fell down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The B.C. Muslim Sports Association said it will issue sanctions against some players. It contends, though, that the sanctions are purely sports-related and that the incident was not religiously motivated.<br>

			<p>The assaulted parties were, according to one account, Ahmedi [or Ahmadiyya.] In their homeland of Pakistan they are looked upon as heretics; any Pakistani will tell the enquirer that &#8220;they are not really Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one and only Pakistani to be a Nobel laureate was one of this minority, a fact which many Pakistanis find intensely galling.</p>
<p>Actually, these &#8216;heretics&rsquo; are sensible and law-abiding settlers in the wider world, like the Ismaeli adherents of the Agha Khan.</p>

			<p>Every day we see that diversity is our greatest strength and makes our lives more &#8220;vibrant&#8221; and exiting. Maybe next time they could bring their internicine wars out onto the street and we could revel in even more Muslim vibrancy. Of course a bomb going off in a Canadian landmark or our Prime Minister being beheaded on national T.V- as a group of the religion of peace wanted to do- well, that would be just as much vibrancy as anyone might ask for!</p>

			<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say, but Buksh is probably a Sufi.  Both Sunnis and Shi&rsquo;ites consider them heretics.  The penalty for heresy in traditional Islam is death.</p>

			<p>To Bill Corr:</p>
<p>Are you referring to Rabindranath Tagore, the 1913 Literature laureate? He was an Indian from the Bengal (now Bangladesh) region.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how a Pakistani can win a Nobel Prize, since their worldview revolves around their tribal god Allah. </p>
