<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} In his message to the participants at the French National Assembly earlier this month, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called Arabic the &#8220;language of the future, of science and of modernity,&#8221; and expressed the hope that &#8220;more French people share in the language that expresses great civilizational and spiritual values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must invest in the Arabic language (because) to teach it symbolizes a moment of exchange, of openness and of tolerance, (and it) brings with it one of the oldest and most prestigious civilizations of the world. It is in France that we have the greatest number of persons of Arabic and Muslim origin. Islam is the second religion of France,&#8221; Sarkozy reminded his listeners.</p>
<p>Sarkozy proceeded to list the various &#8220;advances in terms of diversity,&#8221; the increase in Muslim sections of cemeteries, the training of imams and chaplains and the appointments of ministers of diverse backgrounds.</p>

			<p>What exactly does Sarkozy mean?  That French men and women will have to attain proficiency in Arabic to get ahead in France from now on, just as American citizens are being pressured to develop Spanish language capability or be shut out of a steadily increasing number of job sectors?</p>

			<p>Okay.  That is it. I have had it.  This is over the top.  I am sick of this glorifying of nonwhite civilizations based on PC exaggerations of history.  Where is he getting this garbage from?  The arabs had a brief period of success while Europe was in the Dark Ages.  So what?  They got most of their science from the Greeks anyways (not themselves).  </p>
<p>It is one thing for him to be so ignorant of history, but why exactly is he insisting that they are the future of science?  I could (only partially) understand him saying this about the Chinese perhaps, but why the arabs of all people?  Has he looked at their societies lately?  </p>
<p>Day by day I am seeing how many whites, when it comes to racial preservation, are hands down by far the stupidest people in the world.  That is it.  I have had it!!</p>

			<p>Talk about conceit! As if France was so big it has the luxury of encouraging the spread of Arabic and Islam on its territory. The reality is that France and its culture are becoming an international pip-squeak. France should be fighting with all its might to preserve its uniqueness otherwise it will become extinct.</p>

			<p>Hasn&rsquo;t it ever occured to the French that Sarkozy is obviously an anti-Western, anti-French traitor. I know these are strong words, but my God, just listen to the guy and notice the things that he constantly tries to push. Have the French become that blind? Wasn&rsquo;t it just a few weeks ago, that a mere 1,000 cars were once again incinerated? It is amazing how in denial the traditional populations of the Western World are on some obvious issues. Every display of violence is taken lying down, or with a cynical cold stone face with no emotion. The word Zombie&rsquo;s comes to mind.</p>

This proposal is yet another pathetic and futile capitulation to the Vandals.</p>
<p>During the 1990s&rsquo;, there was a movement in France to preserve and protect French from corruption and degradation from foreign influences. How quickly conventions change. I assume Mr. Sarkozy is attempting to save his own hide when the tide turns and the invaders turn from burning cars to burning heretics.<br>

			<p>Merde! French is the language of the future! A few years ago they wanted to purify the French language of foreign words. We need these people back, where did they go.<br>
   When I was in France, they wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me unless I spoke some French. I didn&rsquo;t mine, it made my French lessons more valuable. So why can&rsquo;t these Frenchmen force the Moslems in their land to speak Frog. I miss arrogant French people.</p>

&#8220;Muslims Refuse to Fight&#8221; yesterday. Sarkozy came<br>
to office after promising a get tough approach, now<br>
he is shown to be another spinelesss western leader.</p>
<p> Are there any true leaders in the west anymore ? It<br>
appears none have the mettle to take a stand. I<br>
have become convinced that all of them are tools<br>
of the NWO.</p>

			<p>This is another new world order boy who thinks he is moving with the tide, rather than fighting it, but he&rsquo;s unaware that the success of a country depends not on adapting the language, religion and culture of colonizers, it is in making certain the population is as homogeneous as it can be.</p>
<p>He erroneously believes also that France must constantly increase its numbers via immigration in order to remain solvent.  Like most leaders of the West, the man is an absolute fool.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the only nations going in that direction are the nations outside the West, like Japan, the Chinese Barbarians, most of South America, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Sub-Sharan Africa, India, and the Middle East, except for some stragglers here and there, and a few exceptions.</p>
<p>If Russia can maintain its present demographics for a while longer, and, perhaps Eastern Europe, then those areas will be the only bright lights of white civilization, and they very possibly could do that, because they&rsquo;re undergoing a severe economic crunch right now, making their areas unattractive to third world rabble looking for handouts.  </p>
<p>Ironically, this fool Sarkozy is braying about the importance of diversity at a time when the future of the entire European continent is in doubt, because of this severe downward economic spiral that the entire West is enduring now, and all indications are that it&rsquo;s very likely to bring it to break up or very close to it.  There has been much ongoing rioting in Europe the last several weeks that the US press has failed to report.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s blacks and muslims are the worst of the lot.  They riot and burn an average of 100 vehicles PER NIGHT throughout the nation, which is substantial, considering the small size of France.  It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine what they would do if they lost their freebies.</p>
<p>An economic collapse just might be the saving factor for the West, and it appears a likely scenario at this point in time,  so fools like this Sarkozy would do much better trying to quell his uprisings and putting his economy in much better shape than he is in acting like an assinine fool promoting a foreign culture within his own borders.  </p>
<p>The man is an idiot, but it&rsquo;s hard to single him out when attitudes like his are the norm for Western leaders.  Without types like him, the West would consist of fewer people but every nation would be stronger and more prosperous.  As it turns out, we might have to collapse in order to survive, but whatever the outcome might be, we would be far better off than we are now.</p>
<p>I think what most people fail to realize is that these so-called Western &#8220;leaders&#8221; are nothing more than each nation&rsquo;s power hungry dregs of society who have no more ability than the common man on the street to manage a nation, and they&rsquo;ve been duped into making decisions that are stupidly destructive.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t in control in the first place, this economic freight train almost upon us would never have gained any momentum.  But they just had to have diversity at all costs. </p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve got it now, so at the least it&rsquo;s going to be entertaining to watch them dance around in hysteria as the situation grows worse over the next year or two.</p>
<p>I just hope that at some point they can be tried in open court for their crimes, as they should be.</p>

			<p>Sarkozy is not white. Is he not an immigrant of a descendent of immigrants? Frankly, all over france and Spain it&rsquo;s like invasion of the Moors. How many in France and Spain have naturally blond hair? Are there any anymore?</p>

<p>No Nicky, it represents a moment of capitulation; an overture to complete and unconditional surrender. </p>
<p>So does this little gem from the original article:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;France is a friend of Arabic countries. We are not seeking a clash between the East and West,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, Nick. <i>They are</i>, and they mean to win. That the once great nation of France, under your leadership, are laying down and allowing them to do so without so much as a proper fight is a shameful atrocity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on French history, but I seem to recall reading somewhere that there was a generation of Frenchmen who fought like hell to defend their home in an obscure little skirmish called World War I. As I understand it, a huge portion of that generation was decimated during said war. Apparently, this is what they died for.</p>
<p>Thanks for the blood, boys. Sorry you wasted your time.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Yes, Bobby.   It has certainly occurred to me.  In fact, it has occurred to a lot of people   &mdash;   at least outside of France, according to what I read.   </p>
<p>As for the French, I really don&rsquo;t know.  It&rsquo;s very strange.   In France, I&rsquo;ve never heard them speak about it.  I&rsquo;d love to get someone into a frank conversation, but they hastily change the subject.  That tells you something.  (Hate speech, you know.   It&rsquo;s classified the same as terrorism. Look at what happened to Brigitte Bardot.)<br>

Just a matter of time.  </p>
<p>During his first year in office,  Sarkozy has been back and forth to Black  Africa  and North Africa a number of times on official visits. He received a very frosty reception in Algeria where one official there refused to meet him and denounced him as nothing but  &#8220;a creature of the media&#8221;!    In Dakar, he proposed a union of &#8220;Eurafrique&#8221; and announced a common goal to fight racism.   He also spent Christmas in Egypt  (on a private visit   &mdash;   maybe it was his honeymoon   &mdash;   I forget). Still, he keeps going back.</p>
<p>What strikes me as incredibly absurd about all this is that no matter how much he woos the Moslems, both Arab and black, in France THEY STILL HATE HIM!    This is exactly analogous to that other tratorious fool, Dubya Bush,  who kept romancing the Mexicans and only got contempt from them in return.   They hated him too!   He never learned.  What is wrong with these dense neocons?  Well, Sarkozy is the French Bush.   He&rsquo;s not called &#8220;Sarkozy the American&#8221; for nothing.</p>
<p>Many French voters opted for him because they though he was a &#8220;safer&#8221;,  more respectable  version of LePen, who the media all said was a dangerous racist.   Well, now they&rsquo;re getting  what they deserve.</p>

<p>The Arabic language doesn&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s own words for &#8220;computer&#8221; &#8220;technical&#8221; &#8220;technician&#8221; &#8220;electronics&#8221; &#8220;TV&#8221; nor any technical terms involved in those diciplines.

			<p>The tragedy that France is slowing becoming has everything to do with immigration and birthrates  &mdash;   if current trends hold true, France will be a majority-Arab nation in fifty years. I cannot imagine anything worse than seeing lovely cities like Lyon, Paris and Marseilles become beacons of Islamofascism. </p>

<p>To say that it is a religion of France, and thus of the French people, is untrue.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This lunatic is a Globalist traitor devoted to trashing the culture, history and heritage of his country. He embodies the soul of the Vichy French government&hellip;&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about Sarkozy being a globalist and a traitor.  But you&rsquo;re completely WRONG comparing him to Pétain or the Vichy government! Just read up on Petain.  He was a  strong conservative and a French patriot  who was a renowned WW 1 hero, called to lead France at the age of 85.  He saw what had been happening  then in Russia  (and Spain) and  wanted to preserve French  civilization  from the Communists who would have been the alternative.   By surrendering to Germany (after France was ALREADY defeated and he had no real choice),  he was accepting reality and  <i>sparing France from further destruction and bloodshed.  </i>The fact is that the real destruction which took place in France came not during the German occupation, but toward the end of the war DURING THE ALLIED INVASION, done by the Allied bombings. </p>
<p>After the war, a lot of history was  re-written  to appease deGaulle and the various socialists who came to  power,  who wanted  to make themselves look perhaps better than they were.  As LePen has  sarcastically commented (about deGaulle):  <i><b>&#8220;Was de Gaulle [in England] braver  than Pétain in the occupied zone?   It was much easier to &#8216;resist&rsquo; in London than to resist in France!&#8221; </b></i> </p>
<p>Vichy even replaced the Republican motto, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, inherited from the 1789 French Revolution, with Travail, Famille, Patrie  (Work,  Family, Country).   The Vichy government is now always  referred to as the &#8220;Vichy Regime&#8221;,  and is repudiated by the current French government which considers it and all its acts illegitimate. <i>&#8220;Up to Jacques Chirac&rsquo;s presidency, the official point of view of the French government was that the Vichy &#8220;regime&#8221; was an illegal government distinct from the French Republic &hellip;this point of view denies any responsibility of the state of France, alleging that acts committed between 1940 and 1944 were unconstitutional acts devoid of legitimacy. The main proponent of this view was Charles de Gaulle himself.&#8221;   </i></p>
<p> HOWEVER,  let it be noted that:  <br>
  <i><b>&#8220;The UNITED STATES  granted Vichy full diplomatic recognition, </b>sending Admiral William D. Leahy to France as American ambassador.  [Roosevelt could not stand de Gaulle, whom he considered an aspiring dictator, and preferred to deal with Petain whom he hoped he could work with.]<br>
The USSR maintained, until June 30, 1941, full diplomatic relations with the Vichy Regime, broken after Vichy supported Operation Barbarossa. <br>
CANADA  maintained, till the beginning of November 1942, full diplomatic relations with the Vichy Regime.<br>
AUSTRALIA maintained, <b>until the end of the war,</b> full diplomatic relations with the Vichy Regime.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As for the Jews:  <i>&#8220;Whatever the Vichy government&rsquo;s initial intent, the numerical outcome was that less than 15% of French Jews&hellip; died.  <b>More Jews lived in France at the end of the Vichy regime than had approximately ten years earlier.&#8221;</b> </i></p>
<p>These quotes are  excerpted from the very Wikipedia article that you gave as reference.</p>

			<p>After all the decades and effort that France has made to ensure that the French language not just survives, but represents a particular European culture, I cannot believe that a majority of French citizens will support this idea.  I think Sarkozy may have just cost himself his post.  I sure hope so.<br>

<p>&gt; Having grandparents who were Jewish does not make anyone a Jew ethnically.  In order to be in an ethnic group, one must participate in that ethnic group&rsquo;s culture and society.  That means language and religion.  If he doesn&rsquo;t practice Judaism, doesn&rsquo;t speak or write either Hebrew or Yiddish, he cannot be considered an ethnic Jew.  Further, genetitcally, he is nearly as far from being a true Jew (Hebrew) as you are because Ashkenazi Jews have so much European DNA and even the most pure German has Middle Eastern (Jewish) dna markers and has for probably centuries.  Learn, Ashkenazi Jews are more European than Middle Eastern.  I don&rsquo;t like Sarkozy, but making up things for use in criticisms of someone is useless and only makes the one making them look uninformed and too bias to be listened too.</p>

			<p>The tragedy that France is slowing becoming has everything to do with immigration and birthrates &mdash;  if current trends hold true, France will be a majority-Arab nation in fifty years. </p>
<p>France will not be an Arab country, it will be a north african muslim ghetto and it will not take 50 years for it to be so. In May, coming through CDG in Paris!! while in customs I thought I was in the Congo!!</p>

			<p>That man is crazy or what!? He feels very proud of the islamization of France! The Islam finally is winning its 1400 years-old war against Europe. Good bye to one of the greatest nation of the world.</p>

You are right! When I was watching the Euro Cup Soccer 2008 I wondered why an African country was allowed to participate. I was wrong! It wasn&rsquo;t an African team, it was the French team!</p>

<p>I know what you mean.  And if you were to venture into any of the immigrant suburbs around the airport, you would think the same. You would think you had landed in the wrong continent! It certainly isn&rsquo;t Europe. </p>
<p>Brussels is even worse. London. Frankfurt. New York!</p>
<p>In fact, ANY major international airport (in the Western world) presents the same chaotic scene. The Great Invasion is on, and the whole world is pouring in. Mother Europe has stopped having children and is up for grabs!  </p>
<p>Oh, but we&rsquo;re not supposed to notice.  Very un-PC to speak of it!   &mdash;   Maybe even a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The industrialized world prospers in part because we choose to have smaller more affordable families than third world blacks and browns.  Population stability is a positive thing while overpopulation is not.  </p>
<p>We maintain a vast nuclear arsenal to prevent the black and brown dregs of the third world from conquering and defeating us through their superior numbers.</p>
<p>Please stop parroting this call to engage third world blacks and browns in a breeding contest to maintain numeric superiority in our own nations.  Instead start planning on driving these interlopers back to their own countries where they belong.</p>
<p>The West became the envy of the world without the help of third world invaders and we can remain as such once we cleanse our nations of undesirables come to colonize the lands of our fathers&hellip;        <br>

<p>First we have to rid our governments of the neo-Marxist traitors who brought them here in the first place. Drastic political change is needed. The two-party (or three-party) system is an absolute sham and is anything but democratic and leads to a lack of input by ordinary people and has left the political elite to do as they please. Our political masters laugh at us while they rule and help themselves.<br>

It has to be made clear that not all of those trators are (open) Marxists. They wear many guises. The American populace was fooled several times into thinking they were electing a &#8220;conservative&#8221;.  But it made no difference. Look what they got each time!<br>

			<p>For many decades the French have become increasingly distressed over the spread of English in the French culture, including, I believe even already in 1989, English being used in the French scientific journals. <br>
I just present this as one piece of information in a frightfully developing mess.<br>
It is true that the Arab world, for several centuries after the collapse of the ancient Roman world till the slow rise of the larger European area, was one of the highest intellectual centers on the planet. <br>
I don&rsquo;t say this to justify what is happening - I powerfully believe each larger ethnicity should have its own geographic area. At least that is the case in a more peaceful world, which is what I want.</p>

<p>Best to use the term neo-Marxist (neo = new form of)like I do. They deliberately use different terms and front groups to confuse the debate. Neo-Marxist is a catch-all term that takes in liberals, Fabian Socialists, Socialist Workers Party etc., some Greens and many others. They are still around aplenty, especially in the EU. With the fall of the USSR they just morphed into different groups to infiltrate like always. Murderers don&rsquo;t join Murderers Clubs or have murderer stamped on their forehead.</p>
