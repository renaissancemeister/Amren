<h1>There&rsquo;s a Resurgence of Great White Athletes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Whitlock, Kansas City Star, January 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There was no time to say this Thursday night when Tim Tebow and the Florida Gators were winning another national championship, but a significant thought ran through my mind:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re witnessing a resurgence of great white athletes in football and basketball.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although he didn&rsquo;t win the Heisman Trophy this season, it&rsquo;s quite obvious Tebow is the best football player in the college game.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tebow, the 2007 Heisman winner, was robbed this year. He&rsquo;s a freakish athlete in the mold of Deion Sanders, Bo Jackson, Jim Brown and Vince Young. Not surprisingly, Sanders, Brown and Young never won the Heisman Trophy. For some reason we struggle to properly honor and recognize our most physically gifted athletes.</p>
<p>That might have to do with the fact that we generally perceive those athletes to be black.</p>
<p>Well, now here comes Tim Tebow, and [he] appears to be a novelty, a white athlete with limitless athleticism.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a symbol of what has already transpired and what we&rsquo;ll soon recognize. The boys from the suburbs are spending just as much time as the boyz from the &#8216;hood working on their bodies and skills.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any hard evidence. {snip} I&rsquo;m basing it off what I see when I travel the country watching the best athletes compete.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t discussed much at the time of the selections a year ago, but in the 2008 Pro Bowl the four defensive ends were all white, including Jared Allen. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the past few years we&rsquo;ve watched a number of white kids dominate college basketball. Tyler Hansbrough is this year&rsquo;s leading candidate for player of the year. {snip}</p>
<p>And, of course, we&rsquo;ve seen many foreign-born white players have tremendous success in the NBA, including Canada&rsquo;s Steve Nash, the winner of two MVP awards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mentioning Vick raises my last theory on why the real or perceived gap between black and white athletes might be closing.</p>
<p>Too many young black men are rotting in jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When you hear the stat rattled off about more young black men being in jail than in college that also means that there are a lot of talented athletes throwing away college scholarships by running afoul of the law.</p>

		<p>Resurgence of great white athletes?</p>
<p>Sorry it isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Even if they are tremendous athletes that cannot match the speed, quickness and jumping ability of black athletes.</p>
<p>How many white children want to devote the same amount of hours that blacks children do for basketball, football etc.? </p>

		<p>The biggest reason for black over representaton in college and pro ranks is because blacks mature physically a year to a year and a half ahead of whites. By the time the whites are fully developed, college scholarships have been already handed out.</p>

		<p>It would be nice to see more deserving white players in sports, especially the NFL. My local team, the Bengals, seem to want to field an all black team. Our black coach drafts almost exclusively black players, many of them thugs. We lead the NFL in players arrested every year. We also bring up the rear in the standings nearly every year. </p>
<p>Our other pro sports team, the Reds, also managed by a black (Dusty Baker), also appears to want to field an all black team. Our white players seem to always get traded away for black players. The Reds also wind up near the bottom of the pack nearly every year. Attendance is not nearly what it used to be. I wonder why. Ownership appears to be clueless. Years ago a Pittsburg Pirates coach said that the Pirates attracted few fans because the team was almost all black. He took some heat until Bill Madlock, a black player, said get off the coach&rsquo;s back, that he was absolutely right. </p>

<p>Organized athletics is primarily about ability, but there are a lot of other things that go into making a successful team player other than pure ability.  I tend to think that a lot of those intangibles are skills that require higher-order cerebral logic that most blacks simply lack, such as delayed gratification of individual stats for the sake of the team, dedication, putting in the hours training, in the weight room and watching film, avoiding all-night clubs, risky sex, excessive alcohol use and illicit drug use, and organizing pit bull fights.</p>
<p>Black men in prison might have some of the athletic talent, but very few of the intangibles for success.  So it&rsquo;s a moot point.</p>
<p>Jason Whitlock is black, so it&rsquo;s surprising that he admits that there are a lot of good white athletes.  But Don Wassall over at www.castefootball.us has proven that there are several barriers in the way that precludes whites, going from high school to college, then college into the pros.</p>

		<p>If this is indeed a trend and it continues, the usual suspects will be crying foul. We&rsquo;ll here nonsense about how blacks are being excluded from sports teams and that not enough is being done to recruit qualified black athletes.</p>
<p>As for more young black men being in jail than in college, we all know that is due to a conspiracy by &#8220;The Man&#8221; to keep blacks in jail and off the playing field.</p>

		<p>The largest growing poverty group are whites and its been growing for a long time, There are alot of angry harded young white males out of this group who have no fear of blacks. Poverty and hard times create tough angry man. This toughness transfers over to sports. The UFC has shown young white men who really are the worlds most bad ass fighters&hellip;.WHITES! <br>
Also look at todays boxing champs. Out of 24 belts 16 are held by white men. This is good news for whites because it gives them hope and role models to look up to that are just like them&hellip;.white!<br>
One last thing that has to be mentioned is the huge amounts of money to be made in professional sports. Millions and millions are up for grabs and hungry,mean and pissed off white men and women want a piece of the action,<br>
Over the next ten to twenty years as things become more economicaly dire in the western world you will see whites start to dominate all contact sports. <br>
GO WHITE MAN GO!!</p>

		<p><i>America&rsquo;s out-of-control incarceration rate has devastated the black community in many ways.i&gt;</i></p>
<p>What a preposterous thing to say.  Are we to believe that not incarcerating blacks that have been convicted would some how help the black community or any other community for that matter.  </p>
<p>It is not the incarceration rate that is out of control; it is the black crime rate that is out of control.  The incarceration rate simply follows the crime rate.  </p>

		<p>There was never any shortage of great White athletes.  The problem was talent scouts overlooking Whites in favor of blacks.  Basketball teams were purposefully stacked with mostly blacks so blacks could be proud of themselves and boost their self-esteem.  I suspect the sudden change is due to falling revenues from Whites who are tired of the black hero worship.  I stopped watching basketball decades ago and gave up football a few years ago.  </p>

<p>The one thing that separates Tim Tebow and the other &#8220;boys from the suburbs&#8221; though Comrade Whitlock, is the fact that not only are they muscular and handsome, they are so in a uniquely human way as well. Unlike the Deion Sanders and Bo Jacksons of the earth, they just seem to lack that anthropoid quality, that makes for such good press and Pepsi commercials.</p>
<p>Now why that might be, I just couldn&rsquo;t hazard a guess?</p>

<p>He makes it sound  so senseless.  As though society took a barrel of perfectly good fruit and placed it in a cell to rot.  </p>
<p>Also, you would think that with so many black criminals locked up, the black crime rate on the outside would be pretty low.  But not so.  Cities with a high black population continue to have the highest crime rates.   </p>

		<p>So now I understand. There is a resurgence of white athletes but that is only because white society has unjustly locked up black athlestes so that can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>I feel so guilty.  We all need to do more to reverse this terrible trend.  Lets force more whites into prison so we can all be equal.</p>

		<p>I was watching a movie on TV that reminded me this, &#8216;Great White Hype&rsquo; about boxing. The champ was mad because he as &#8216;38 and 0&rsquo; yet some people were rooting for the challenger, a white guy, only because they were racist. What the story really reminded me of, tho, was Obama, the nations 43rd president or whatever, and how racist people were for not supporting Obama&hellip; Of course, we have had some white boxing champions over the last few years or so. Must be due to more police dragnets.</p>

<p>A &#8220;novelty&#8221; with limitless athleticism?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a sports fan but it seems to me that there have been many great white athletes from the past(and present).</p>
<p>The writer seems to fear a resurgence of pride in and by white athletes. If blacks continue to be liabilities such as with Vicks and Palxico Burres club owners may begin factoring background into team selections. That&rsquo;s a justifiable response.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t follow sports as a rule, but as I listened to NPR last week in my morning routine, they ran a feature story on Tebow. Clearly his football prowess was impressive, even to me, but there were two other significant parts:</p>
<p>1. His apparently sincere and 24/7 Christian faith, including missionary work in Filipino prisons, if I understand right, during his youth, and</p>
<p>2. in discussing the pending championship game, they ran a clip of an opponent mouthing off about Tebow&rsquo;s ability  &mdash;  said opponent (Oklahoma team member??  &mdash;  I forget) sounding like your typical &#8216;afalete&rsquo;. I hope he enjoyed the taste of that crow he ate after the game. It made my day.</p>
<p>Tebow is clearly a <i>mensch</i>. I wish him all the best.</p>

		<p>&#8220;All of the Tebow children were homeschooled by their mother, who worked to instill the family&rsquo;s deep Christian beliefs along the way.[7] In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing homeschooled students to compete in local high school sporting events&#8221;.<br>

<p>The only problem is that sometime soon (hint, hint: think January 20th) we&rsquo;ll be treated to a new type of affirmative action that penalizes White men for their &#8220;new-found&#8221; athletic successes.</p>
<p>BTW, White boxers have been hugely dominating the international sport for some time now.  Is that why boxing has ceased to be a front page athletic event for America&rsquo;s ultra-liberal media?</p>

<p>The myth that black males are &#8220;inherently superior&#8221; to white males in football, basketball and other sports is excellently refuted at <a href="https://www.castefootball.us//" rel="nofollow">Caste Football</a>:<br>
The site catalogues the underhanded methods at which white athletes have, from the 60&rsquo;s onwards, been &#8220;Affirmative-Actioned&#8221; out of more media-worthy positions to create the illusion of &#8220;Black dominance in sport&#8221;, how these supposed black ubermenschen are repeatedly put to shame by &#8220;non-diverse&#8221; (i.e. white) European teams and how - regardless of performance - &#8220;token whites&#8221; on basketball teams always find themselves benched.</p>
<p>Oh, and black Americans don&rsquo;t do too well in swimming because there were no &#8220;Coloured&#8221; pools in the South&hellip;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t necessarity assume to see outstanding speed position white college footballers appearing in the NFL.  Go to the Caste Football website and you can read about very successful white college players who do things like run 4.29 40 yard dashes (Stan Zwinggi) and don&rsquo;t even get drafted.   It&rsquo;s my contention that NFL teams don&rsquo;t draft such white players because black NFL players target them for injury.  These white men will likely be the recipients of crippling injuries in their first or second year if not in training camp.  I don&rsquo;t have stats to back up this assertion but it&rsquo;s based on incidents I have witnessed over the years watching football (pro and college), my own experiences in track and field and the experience of a good friend of mine who played Big Ten football years ago.  </p>
<p>Black people are in general, very possessive. For example, they are not going to fairly relinquish any speed positions in the NFL to a whitey because they feel their overall physical superiority gives them a God given right to dominate these positions totally.</p>
<p>The white owners and coaches realize they cannot win without black players and therefore do not buck the racial caste system in pro football.  They are keeping the status quo so they can win football games with the least amount of flack. </p>
<p>The education system and the controlled mass media of news and entertainment are both unquestionably, pro-black and anti-white.  The propaganda causes whites to shy away from racial questions or any assertions like black players are racists who will attack a white player threatening one of their NFL speed positions.  Many white people would not even entertain such a thought.  Blacks on the other hand, are hyped up to attack whitey by the same agitation propaganda that makes whites act submissive and feel guilty about being white.   </p>

		<p>Some of the responses here are odd for a race realist site.  Whenever an article is posted about lower black achievement in academics or the workplace, it&rsquo;s attributed to lower intelligence and justifications such as racism are batted down.  However, when the subject of lower white athletic ability comes up, excuses such as racist scouts overlooking white talent flourish.  The positions are not at all consistent.  </p>

<p>I believe there is truth in this.  On the high school level, it is always the majority white teams that constantly beat the inner city, all black teams.  Granted, blacks are still able to play sports well, but they are exaggerated as usual.   </p>

		<p>I have a problem hearing whites talk about how superior blacks are athletically.This American society has played into the myths of black superiority in sports.We just had a white man win 8 gold medals in swimming.We have most of the championship belts in boxing.How many black hockey players are there?Most of the belts in boxing are held by Russian fighters.Why?? because they don&rsquo;t buy into the propaganda that is preached in this country.Look at the fighter Kelly Pavlik.Alot of great white  football players are in professional baseball.There is one of the fastest wide receivers that set records at Norte Dame that is playing pro -baseball now.When he was in college because he was white he didn&rsquo;t get to play because the starter was black.When the black starter got injured they put the white guy in and when the black star recovered he never got his starting job back because the white man broke all the records.Any football team with a black quarterback is  handi-capped.All black quarterbacks know how to do is run the ball which is easy for a defense to stop because they know he can&rsquo;t pass well.Please white people and coaches change your thoughts and give white players an opportunity you will not be sorry!</p>

		<p>Please see William Hendershot&rsquo;s comment regarding the developmental differences between Whites and blacks, above.  Earlier maturation is the prevailing reason why blacks are perceived to be superior athletes.  In youth football leagues, White children more or less dominate until high school, at which time blacks leap forward in terms of speed, size, strength, and dexterity.  Why is this?  Because the blacks have reached puberty earlier.  Look at any group of 17-year-old males   &mdash;   the Whites will look like what they are&hellip;boys.  The blacks, however, will look like fully developed men.  This fact, alone, is sufficient to justify the segregation of youth and prep sports (and schools in general, for that matter, but that is a topic for another thread). </p>
<p>If anyone is looking for practical evidence of this basic biological difference between Whites and blacks, please consider the large number of professional athletes produced by Brigham Young University.  As most people know, BYU is a Mormon institution, and most of their athletes are White and take at least 2 years off from school for a Mormon mission.  Consequently, BYU&rsquo;s junior and senior athletes are generally 2 to 3 years older than their counterparts at other schools.  Although most of the student-athletes that attend BYU are not &#8220;five-star&#8221; blue-chippers coming out of high school, they progress to the pro ranks in very high numbers (check it out for yourself).  This is due in large part because they have bridged the age and development gap with black athletes.  </p>

		<p>Tebow will hopefully become a true role model to young white men.  He was home schooled by his parents who were Christian missionaries.  I read a recent interview of his, and he stated that football wasn&rsquo;t even third on his list of most of important things in his life.  He listed his faith, family, education and then football.  I truly hope Tebow follows through on this and finishes his Senior year in college.  If he does enter the draft this year, he may very likely land in Detroit, and what an awful thing that would be.  Brady Quinn, another potential, great white athlete also finished his education.  I doubt you will see either of these young men in prison.  </p>

		<p>I was a St Louis Rams fan.  I could not believe the relentless number of late hits on their quarterback Warner.  Right in front of the OTs and OLM and the refs.  No calls.  Relentless.  Turned his body and brain to mush-for a while.  Now he&rsquo;s back with Arizona, but is considering retiring because of all of the earlier brain damage.  Its sad, he had passing accuracy and timing like I&rsquo;ve never seen.  A white professed Christian player better watch his back in the NFL-at least if he plays for a small market team.  </p>

		<p>Tebow and Myron Rolle are statistical anomalies, denizens of the tail end of the belle curve.  Nevertheless, both are worthy of admiration for their accomplishments, and are excellent role models.  For those of you who do not know, Myron Rolle is a black football player who won a Rhodes scholarship.  Most blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less.

		<p>There are many very good white athletes yet blacks dominate that one percent upper strata in the speed/strength/quickness/leaping sports like football and basketball.  The best way to keep blacks from dominating these sports is by tightening up academic standards for all who attend colleges.  But white alumni and the black lobby wouldn;t stand for it, for very different reasons.</p>
<p>Today, college and professional football and basketball are culturally black sports.  White athletes in these sports must adapt to the black culture, not visa versa.  Sadly, some whites in football and basketball become culturally black like Eminem.</p>

		<p>To THE MAN:</p>
<p>   To be fair you must base comparisons of athletic ability based on sports that are equally contested.  Football is the perfect basis because all high schools in America, no matter the color or income, care a lot about their teams.  Football is equally emphasized and their are terrific incentives for being on the team.  </p>
<p>   In the end, professional football is overwhelmingly black.  It is a stretch to say such over representation is determined by biased coaches and scouts.  (These are highly competitive businesses.  Significant flaws in the business model are flushed quickly.)  </p>
<p>   My point is many are eager to bash black intelligence but are afraid of the &#8220;race realist&#8221; straight talk on white athletics (and most importantly its role in determining comparative perceptions of masculinity.) </p>
<p>   I suspect a lot of bashing of black intelligence is motivated by a hurt ego.   </p>

		<p>There are a higher percentage of blacks with the make-up to be top sprinters. They also tend to be able to jump farther (the vertical advantage is actually a myth) Anyway, the higher percentage of &#8220;sprinters&#8221; is a given. However, the dominance we see now is artificial. ANYONE who actually takes the time to watch, say, the NFL combines and look at ALL of the results will realize a) The media is slanting things and b) the NFL purposely ignores fast, athletic whites at most positions. Yes, the whites are targeted for injury by black players, as I had seen myself as a Div I football player. At the combines I performed much better than 99% of the blacks I was up against, but the league apparently decided they were only going to allow so many whites at my position (TE), and that was that. This isn&rsquo;t idle talk, it&rsquo;s well known among football players and baseball players. MLB is even worse now, they&rsquo;ll promote latinos and ANY black American over a white player these days, such is the state of things. </p>
<p>A note on &#8220;quickness&#8221;. Blacks have speed but generally are not as quick as whites. For instance, watch whites against blacks in the shuttle run, etc. at the combines. Or you might have to scour the results as ESPN etc make sure to only show blacks competing. Whites hold the records. This is along the lines of black receivers (and running backs) who cough up the ball much more often than whites, but this is never mentioned in the press, although honest sports fans notice it. This is why whites are called &#8220;possession receivers&#8221;.  Any of you guys out there who have played at a high level probably noticed that black players, while fast, usually had lousy reactions. I don&rsquo;t know why, but whites just seemed to have better reactions to most things at the spur of the moment, in real time. This is one reason they are better quarterbacks, just don&rsquo;t tell Steve Sailer, who thinks these generally dim witted ego-maniacs have great &#8220;real time&#8221; thinking ability. </p>

<p>Stan Zwinggi, the superb white athlete, wasn&rsquo;t drafted to keep up the myth that there is some &#8216;mystical quarterbacking quality&rsquo; that makes quarterbacks great that has little to do with raw athletic talent. Thereby keeping a certainly number of whites in football especially at the quarterback position.

		<p>Note to Obscuratatus: White men cannot reclaim weightlifting because they never lost it. African men often have great muscular definition because they have little subcutaneous fat (they store body fat intramuscularly). It may be great for impressing women, but having worked out with Blacks in gyms, as well as competed against them, I have observed no unusual strength versus bodyweight. Weightlifting records confirm this observation. Eskimo  men are at the other end of the spectrum, they have &#8220;girlie&#8221; definition, but lack nothing in strength versus bodyweight.</p>

		<p>AmRen readers need to stop whining and coming up with lame excuses as to why Blacks excel at and dominate certain sports.  You sound just like the Marxists who come up with excuses as to why Blacks score lower on IQ tests and need affirmative action programs to land jobs.</p>
<p>Black athletes are genetically more muscular, mature faster, and have more explosive power than Whites.  Look at how winning football teams, generally, are broken down.  Blacks dominate as running backs, wide receivers, defensive backs, and defensive linemen.  Whites dominate the quarterback position and the offensive line.  Both Whites and Blacks make excellent linebackers still, because it is a position that requires both athleticism and intelligence.</p>
<p>Boxing has been dominated by Blacks for the same reason; however, in the mixed martial arts, and the Ultimate Fight Challenge, Whites tend to dominate because it requires much more than pure physical power  &mdash;  it involves strategy, intelligence, and endurance  &mdash;  areas that Black do not excel at.</p>
<p>Whites dominate in so many other areas than certain sports that are much more valuable to civilization  &mdash;  invention, philosophy, art, literature, music, etc.  Whites don&rsquo;t have to be the best at everything to be a dominate force in our world.  Let Blacks be what they are  &mdash;  great physical athletes, and let them entertain us while Whites run the rest of the most important aspects of the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You mean the one who just got beaten to a bloody pulp by a washed-up old man? Nah, let&rsquo;s not look at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny how Hopkins suddenly became washed up after he got destroyed by Calzaghe&hellip;</p>

		<p>No, he lost a split decision to Calzaghe, after being beaten twice by Jermaine Taylor.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Really? Care to explain why whites are now ethnically cleansing blacks from middleweight to heavyweight? Or why Soviet whites destroyed most top level American blacks at amatuer meets for decades?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are exaggerating quite a bit.  Soviets have never dominated amateur boxing as shown by the link.  Dominance has traditionally come from Cuba (whose boxers are predominantly black) and American blacks.  In the past decade, U.S white and black boxers have become less competitive and that is mostly due to a growing lack of interest in the sport.  Those who would have boxed 20 years ago now play football, basketball, etc.</p>

		<p>The Cubans did dominate amateur boxing for a long time, but that&rsquo;s because the average age of their fighters was almost a decade older than everyone else, white, black, whatever, that they were fighting. But that&rsquo;s not the main point:</p>
<p>The excuse that potential fighters from the US are now choosing football over boxing is not true. In point of fact, the gyms in the US are now more full than ever with black and even more so with hispanic fighters. The fact is that they are now fighting the rest of the world, not just a few whites here or there. And a lot of those whites aren&rsquo;t cowed like a lot of American whites, which bothers those cowed whites and liberal Marxists. Even Emanuel Steward, a top trainer of fighters - and he&rsquo;s black - said back in the 80&rsquo;s that a lot of the European fighters had great potential but did not pursue pro boxing much while the goal of all US fighters was to make money in the sport. He also said back then that the E. European fighters could possibly dominate at heavyweight with their strength and punching power. He felt their style wasn&rsquo;t good for amateur boxing which will reward fighters for running backwards and punching which fast blacks are very good at. We&rsquo;re just seeing some things being reorganized is all. Blacks have advantages in some areas of sport, obviously. But other areas that were in fact set up for them are now taking a beating with whites reclaiming top spots and more Asians showing up on the winner&rsquo;s stands. </p>

		<p>I said Amatuer meets, not the Olympics.  Great Cuban heavyweight, Teofilho Stevenson, was twice defeated by Soviet heavyweight Igor Vivstotsky and beaten by American Duane Bobick at the Pan-Am Games.</p>
<p>And prey tell : how are potential blac middleweights, lightheavyweights and cruiserweights going into football and basketball? Do you have statistics to back up this claim?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a great athlete to be a great boxer. Joe Frazier proved that quite nicely with his performance in the &#8220;Superstars&#8221; sporting contest in the 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
