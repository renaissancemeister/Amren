<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-22-securelicense_N.htm">Feds to &#8216;Rethink&rsquo; License Mandate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Frank, USA Today, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Thursday afternoon that she will &#8220;rethink&#8221; a program that requires every state to issue more secure driver&rsquo;s licenses by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The new licenses, required under a 2005 federal law, aim to prevent criminals and potential terrorists from getting fake IDs. But the licenses have been opposed by many governors, who cite the cost. Added opposition comes from the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the cards are, in effect, a national ID card.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really has taken the form of a huge unfunded mandate on states which are struggling with huge cuts right now,&#8221; Napolitano said Thursday, one day after she was sworn in as head of the third-largest federal department. Napolitano, the governor of Arizona until Tuesday, noted that she had signed a bill in June barring the state from complying with the license law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington state has been offering residents &#8220;enhanced&#8221; driver&rsquo;s licenses that can be used in place of a passport to enter the USA from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean. The enhanced license, which is voluntary and slightly more expensive than a standard license, requires proof of citizenship and identity. It contains a radio identification tag that allows Customs officials to read the information on the license electronically.</p>
<p>The enhanced license differs from licenses envisioned under the Real ID law, which sets minimum standards for each state. Critics such as the ACLU have said the two types of licenses are basically the same.</p>

This shows how the government has totally abandoned its duty to protect the nation against terrorist attack.</p>
<p>We are going to get hit again and hit hard.  And actions like this license thing are going to be responsible.</p>

			<p>Aw shucks, just include the secure ID in the economic stimulus bill&hellip;.makes much more sense than the nonsense they are including now&hellip;.and will save the US much more money than windmills and solar panels for Federal buildings.<br>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t want a &#8220;foolproof&#8221; national ID anyway.  I don&rsquo;t need any card with a photo on it to tell a foreigner from an American.  My eye and ear are more reliable than any government document.</p>

			<p>Our government, in it&rsquo;s infinite wisdom, doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to hundreds of billions in bailout money. But a much needed national security program is way too expensive?</p>

			<p>A long time well known advocate for illegal immigration and someone who is eager to see White America die is now in charge of homeland Security.   </p>

<p>Agreed!! since the U.S. is calling those Somalis that were in Minnesota AMERICANS!!! nothing was said in the news about them being black &#8220;political refugees? from Somalia to begin with.</p>

			<p>This Real ID thing WILL NOT make Americans safer, it&rsquo;ll just clamp down on law-abiding citizens.  I&rsquo;m against it.</p>
<p>We do not need a &#8220;more secure&#8221; ID.  </p>
<p>Papers, please!</p>

			<p>I was for this in the beginning but then realized it&rsquo;s the Federal Government usurping states rights.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not about a secure id. It&rsquo;s about making it easier for dead people, felons, and illegal aliens to vote democrat.</p>

			<p>&#8221; it&rsquo;s not about secure i.d.&#8221;, I agree 100%. If this is made mandatory it might one more much needed tool to get the illegal invaders out of our country. It is too bad it has come to this, thanks to the government.</p>
