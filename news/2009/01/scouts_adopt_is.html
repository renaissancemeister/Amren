<h1><a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/news/20090120/scouts-adopt-islamic-pledge/">Scouts Adopt Islamic Pledge</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Institute, January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Boy Scouts in Dundee will be able to pledge allegiance to &#8216;Allah&rsquo; and drop the traditional oath to God and Queen, says the Scout Association in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Association has given its backing to starting Dundee&rsquo;s 45th troop which will specifically target Muslim boys.</p>
<p>In the oath Muslim recruits will be able to replace the name &#8216;God&rsquo; with &#8220;Allah, the Most Beneficent and the Most Merciful&#8221;, and pledge to honour &#8220;the country in which I am now living&#8221; instead of the Queen.</p>
<p>The Scout Association is already open to all faiths and Muslim boys are currently part of existing troops, but according to the Association they are aware of some who might be opposed to the traditional pledge.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Scout Association Drummond Cox claims the change &#8220;represents a tweak rather than a major change&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The Scouts may have been a Christian organisation originally but we have long been non-denominational and inclusive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new troop will in no way be exclusionary and non-Muslim boys may join if they wish in an initiative that has the support of the Muslim community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cox added: &#8220;There are already Muslim boys in troops around Dundee but until now we do not have one catering for Muslims specifically. It is affirmative action.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Richard Cook of the Campaign Against Political Correctness said: &#8220;This is a disappointing development and many people will worry about the sad loss of much-loved traditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Muslims in this country are proud monarchists, so it seems wrong to alter the pledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cook warns: &#8220;Quite apart from the risk of creating a two-tier Scout movement, there is also the question of how helpful it is to set up a group that specifically aims to recruit young Muslims when we are trying to be more inclusive of other communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t this just perpetuate the divisions at the expense of cherished traditions?&#8221;<br>

			<p>It really isn&rsquo;t the muslims fault.  This is all White marxist nonsense.  Muslims are an unassimalable population.  No non muslim country should allow muslims immigration.  It is the marxist Whites allow them into the country, and Marxist whites who will use government coercion to change cultural institutions.  </p>
<p>When the muslims take over Scotland, will they allow Scottish men to wear kilts or will they make them wear burkas?</p>

			<p>How about the muslim boys forming their own troops and quit trying to change the oath that is used by Christian scouts? And may I suggest that they take their oaths somewhere deep in the Middle East. This is the new way to take over a country and a culture. The UK is being overtaken by Muslims and the US by Mexicans.</p>

			<p>  Just one more breach in our dam . Seemingly insignificant except we ran out of little, blond,blue eyed,fair complected Dutch boys to plug the holes years ago . By the time we come to the realization that we have been conquered without a shot having been fired,that all good patriots are xenophobes and that nations without borders are not really nations after all, it will be far too late and the sun will have set upon European Europe and her progeny,the US,Australia.New Zealand,Canada etc., for the last time . We will not even be a memory,much less a fond one in the minds of those who have replaced us at our own behest.     </p>

			<p>Will there be a &#8220;Beheading&#8221; merit badge? Chop 10 Christian or 5 Jewish heads and get a badge. <br>
How about the &#8220;Hate&#8221; badge? Take part in 10 demonstrations or parades yelling and screaming &#8220;death to the infidels&#8221; and you can proudly wear this badge.</p>

<p><br>
I suppose this represents progress?  </p>
<p>But why replace the queen? Moslem countries have monarchs too.  What have they got against the queen?  Is it because she&rsquo;s a woman?  Is that &#8220;offensive&#8221; or something?  I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Allah is God. Just a different language.  </p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re non-denominational now, why have any oath at all?</p>
<p>This is so insane!</p>

			<p>Their god is not my God.  </p>
<p>Allah is not equatable to the only God of the Trinity of Christian faiths.</p>
<p>Muslims believe Allah is god and that Jesus was a prophet or a great man. They do not believe that Jesus is God in human flesh who was on earth. </p>
<p>Their is no comparison. They should not try to replace words that do not mean the same thing. They should not participate in the original pledge. They can say their own pledge in privacy or amongst an all Islamic Scout meeting.</p>
<p>(Within a couple of days I&rsquo;ve been aware of so many examples of this all inclusivity of everyone and everything. From their being a 7 day grace period on the deadline for returning rented DVDs, to not being required to adhere to deadlines and policies of an online program, to not needing to show up for work on time. It&rsquo;s ridiculous! Why have rules and deadlines if you know you can break them? It changes the definition completely. Without order there is chaos! I told this to my online instructor. I&rsquo;m following the deadline for assignments/tests to be submitted for my order, for my sanity, even if it means I take a lower grade. Having some type of schedule and order to life is very comforting. People that take things for granted do just that continuously.)</p>

<p>The muslims profess to hate homosexuality but the practice in the Saudi and Kuwaiti male muslim world is wide spread.</p>

<p>Muslim countries have religious tyrant rulers, there is a difference and the muslim&rsquo;s problem with the queen is that she is not Saudi and she is not muslim!! Females are also considered worth less than a donkey in the muslim world, it really chaffes the muslim world to have to deal with a female Sect. of State from the U.S.</p>

			<p>  It is very doubtful that it is the same god . Mohammed piggy backed his upstart religion onto Christianity and Judaism to give it validity and it worked beautifully . From there it was spread with the sword and when it began to threaten the whole world the Crusaders entered the picture .Were it not for them we would all be toting our prayer rugs tucked under our arms.While the Arabs had a pantheon of gods before Mohammed,one of the most important was the moon god Allah whose symbol was the crescent moon we all know so well today as the symbol of Islam .Coincidence ? Very doubtful .Also you have to ask yourself this, knowing the angst between the two ethnic groups that has existed for thousands of years, why would Muslims accept Jewish prophets and Jewish history as their own ? They wouldn&rsquo;t, it is not the same god . Mohammed was a middle class merchant who used his business savvy to establish a religion whose purpose it was to unite the Arab world .Even today it is more of a political ideology than,&#8221;just a religion.&#8221; Albeit one that may realize it&rsquo;s dream of world domination .</p>

<p><br>
No, they&rsquo;ll increase it. All the while they&rsquo;ll be denouncing it.<br>
With their culture, it&rsquo;s say one thing but do another.<br>
The main thing for them is  &#8220;Do anything but just don&rsquo;t get caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the Scots allow the muslims to take over their country, the Scot men will wear exactly what the muslim Imams tell them to wear.</p>
