<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1202024">Dutch MP to Be Prosecuted Over Anti-Koran Film &#8216;Fitna&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Right-wing Dutch MP Geert Wilders, who has made a short film accusing the Koran of inciting violence, must be prosecuted for anti-Islam comments, an Amsterdam court said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The court overruled the public prosecutor who had argued that Mr. Wilders, whose film &#8220;Fitna&#8221; urged Muslims to tear out &#8220;hate-filled&#8221; verses from the Koran, was protected by the right to free speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Amsterdam appeals court has ordered the prosecution of member of parliament Geert Wilders for inciting hatred and discrimination, based on comments by him in various media on Muslims and their beliefs,&#8221; the court said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

			<p>I helped promote this film/video. I salute the brave patriots in Holland who have risked their lives against the Muslim invaders/terrorists. Too many have been murdered to defend our Western freedoms.</p>
<p>That said.</p>
<p>I think this movie is too serious.</p>
<p>Our music video &#8220;it&rsquo;s a Religion of Peace&#8221; covers the same subject, but adds humor, sarcasm and popular music of former Brit pop/folk singer Cat Steves/Yusuf Islam</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q</a></p>
<p>It is important to use the weapons of humor with invading Muslim terrorists/extremists as humor is something the Third World Muslim extremists can not handle. </p>
<p>Humor also is a great weapon against the holier than though PC thought police. They like to think they are on the side of &#8220;Progress&#8221; they are supposedly &#8220;Progressive&#8221;.</p>
<p>So tell us PC elites, what exactly is so &#8220;progressive&#8221; about promoting 8th century Islamic extremist immigrant invaders? Perhaps you &#8220;progressives&#8221; would enjoy the multicultural experience of attending a Taliban public execution of women who showed their faces in public&hellip;.</p>
<p>Not that there are not many annoying Western PC women who don&rsquo;t deserve a good lash on their butts, but public execution by shooting - that&rsquo;s not the Western way.</p>

			<p>If they can prosecute someone for speaking surely they can prosecute someone for being in the country uninvited or even kick them out of the country. </p>

			<p>Another dark hour in the fight against the Islamic incursion into Europe. Makes you wonder how much longer we have before nothing more can be said or done about it at all.</p>

			<p>The charges will be dropped or reduced because if he is jailed he will will 10 more seats in the Tweede Kamer.  This is all about State intimidation.  Iraq is more democratic than Holland.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s insulting Nazis!</p>
<p>Oh, btw, he believes in censoring the Koran, so he&rsquo;s not really in a position to complain. I have reservations about this guy. His concerns are very restricted, not universal.  He does not support freedom of the press.  Like them, he just wants freedom for himself.</p>

<p><b>The Uncomfortable Definition of an Infidel &hellip;</b> <br>
 Allah or the Lord Jesus Christ? The Muslim religion is by far the fastest  growing religion in the UK . <br>
 Last month I attended my annual training session that&rsquo;s required for maintaining my prison security clearance. During the training session  there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their beliefs.<br>
I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a video<br>
  After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers. <br>
  When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked: <br>
   &#8216;Please, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world and, that by killing an infidel, (which is a command to all Muslims) they are assured of a place in heaven. <br>
  If that&rsquo;s the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?&rsquo; <br>
  There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he replied, &#8216;Non-believers!&rsquo; <br>
  I responded, &#8216;So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can have a place in heaven. Is that correct?&rsquo; <br>
  The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of  &#8216;a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.&rsquo; <br>
  He sheepishly replied, &#8216;Yes.&rsquo; <br>
  I then stated, &#8216;Well, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope Benedict commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley ordering all Protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them  a place in heaven!&rsquo; <br>
  The Imam was speechless! <br>
  I continued, &#8216;I also have a problem with being your &#8216;friend&rsquo; when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me! Let me ask you a question. Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to kill me in order for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you  because I am going to heaven and He wants you to be there with me?&rsquo;<br>
  You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam remained speechless. <br>
  Needless to say, the organizers and promoters of the &#8216;Diversification&rsquo; training seminar were not happy with this way of dealing with the Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslims&rsquo; beliefs. <br>
  Within twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U..K. to elect a government of their choice, complete with sharia law <br>
  I think everyone in the U.K. should be required to read this, but with the Liberal justice system, liberal media and the political correctness madness, there is no way this will be widely publicised. <br>
   Please pass this on to all your e-mail contacts. <br>

<p>I think he would rather convert you than kill you, because that would mean another soul for Allah. He&rsquo;d offer you the choice of Islam first.  But if you resist his offer, then killing you remains an option.</p>

			<p><i>The court received numerous complaints from citizens after the prosecution service refused to press charges against Mr. Wilders for his public anti-Islamic utterances.</i></p>
<p>I wonder&hellip;</p>
<p>Just what percentage of these complaints, do you suppose, came from angry muslims who want the infidel punished?</p>
<p>And what percentage came from Dutchmen whose angry muslim neighbors were throwing childish tantrums and threatening and/or committing acts of violence and rioting if the infidel was not punished?</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>

			<p>I believe in such situation he should go on the offensive and propose a law - perhaps constitutional amendment - to ban islam and political correctness. I&rsquo;d even say that it&rsquo;s his obligation to his voters, who are threatend with both ideologies.  </p>
<p>I suppose this would strengthen his position in courts, as not only his right to free speach, but also rights as a lawmaker would be nullified by being sentenced. Besides it&rsquo;d show in court that he is working within the framework of democratic law changing (movie as a way of starting a debate to change the constitution), while these &#8220;hate&#8221; laws were originally aimed at protesters/social unrest (which makes them bad too BTW).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important then to explain to both courts and public, that he and many other people fear islam as a threat; that this threat is real (eg. examples from islamic countries). That is his actions were not motivated by hate but by concern, fear, and trying to protect people from evil ideology.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an important distinction of people and ideology here. The movie was about criticizing ideology (islam), the hate laws are about people. It&rsquo;s important to show the distinction, and that in fact muslims (especially women!) are victims of islam, and the goal of accused was to help the victims.</p>
<p>If such arguments are no defence in courts, than I guess the only way is to go after judges, who misinterpret law: as an MP he can propose law to punish judges for PC activities. Zero tolerance/no immunity adviced here. </p>
<p>Another way of getting on offensive would be to try to persecute immans for reading hate parts of Koran, with orders to kill the pagans or wage war, or against publishers who sell this hate literature. This is a perfect example of where hate laws should be applied.   </p>

			<p>I still say the Dutch authorities are going to crumble and hand Mr. Wilders over to the Jordanians for a &#8220;trial&#8221; after which, he will be beheaded.</p>

			<p><b>&#8220;I still say the Dutch authorities are going to crumble&hellip;&#8221;</b> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting to see their whole rickety house of cards crumble. This situation can&rsquo;t go on for more than perhaps another dozen years when the country will collapse into civil war and chaos.</p>
<p>The sooner the better, I hate to say, as it will give the Dutch a better chance to prevail and get their country back. They need to take it back from the invaders   &mdash;    as well as from the sell-out Marxists and traitors who have put them into this mess which never had to be.</p>

			<p>I recently received the John Harrison &#8220;Definition of an Infidel&#8221; as well and it&rsquo;s scary reading.  That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t come to terms with Muslims telling me their religion is a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;.  Perhaps it was at one time (research says otherwise), but not anymore.</p>
<p>We Christians committed horrible acts during the crusades; the conflict in Ireland, etc., etc., but we have evolved from those times and really have very few fanatics any longer. </p>
<p>Muslims should not immigrate to Western countries &#8220;for a better life&#8221; if they have no intention of following the rules and laws of that country.  Muslims born and raised in Western countries are being fed hateful rhetoric by their fanatical Imans and become brain-washed into committing suicide murders.  </p>
<p>Every religion has moderated over the centuries, but not Islam - it wants to revert to it&rsquo;s barbaric ways and cannot tolerate &#8220;infidels&#8221;.  The West is too PC and needs to wake up before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>
