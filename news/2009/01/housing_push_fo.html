			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Schmidt and Maurice Tamman, Wall Street Journal, January 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, immigrants to the U.S. have viewed buying a home as the ultimate benchmark of success. Between 2000 and 2007, as the Hispanic population increased, Hispanic homeownership grew even faster, increasing by 47%, to 6.1 million from 4.1 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Over that same period, homeownership nationally grew by 8%. In 2005 alone, mortgages to Hispanics jumped by 29%, with expensive nonprime mortgages soaring 169%, according to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.</p>
<p>An examination of that borrowing spree by The Wall Street Journal reveals that it wasn&rsquo;t simply the mortgage market at work. It was fueled by a campaign by low-income housing groups, Hispanic lawmakers, a congressional Hispanic housing initiative, mortgage lenders and brokers, who all were pushing to increase homeownership among Latinos.</p>
<p>The network included Mr. Baca [Rep. Joe Backa, D-Calif.], chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose district is 58% Hispanic and ranks No. 5 among all congressional districts in percentage of home loans not tailored for prime borrowers. The caucus launched a housing initiative called Hogar &mdash; Spanish for home &mdash; to work with industry and community groups to increase mortgage lending to Latinos. Mortgage companies provided funding to that group, and to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, which fielded an army to make the loans.</p>
<p>In years past, minority borrowers seeking loans were often stopped cold by a practice called red-lining, in which lenders were reluctant to lend within particular geographical areas, often, it appeared, on the basis of race. But combined efforts to open the mortgage pipeline to Latinos proved successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw what we refer to in the advocacy community as reverse red-lining,&#8221; says Aracely Panameno, director of Latino affairs for the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group. &#8220;Lenders were seeking out those borrowers and charging them through the roof,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Ms. Panameno says that during the height of the housing boom she sought to present the Hispanic Caucus with data showing how many Latinos were being steered into risky and expensive subprime loans. Hogar declined her requests, she says.</p>
<p>When the national housing market began unraveling, so did the fortunes of many of the new homeowners. National foreclosure statistics don&rsquo;t break out data by ethnicity or race. But there is evidence that Hispanic borrowers have been hard hit. In part, that&rsquo;s because of large Hispanic populations in areas where the housing bubble was pronounced, such as Southern California, Nevada and Florida.</p>
<p>In U.S. counties where Hispanics account for more than 25% of the population, banks have taken back 6.7 homes per 1,000 residents since Jan. 1, 2006, compared with 4.6 per 1,000 residents in all counties, according to a Journal analysis of U.S. Census and RealtyTrac data.</p>
<p>Hispanic lawmakers and community groups have blamed subprime lenders, who specialize in making loans to customers with spotty credit histories. They complain that even solid borrowers were steered to those loans, which carry higher interest rates.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Mr. Baca blamed the foreclosure crisis among Hispanics on borrowers&rsquo; lack of &#8220;financial literacy&#8221; and on &#8220;lenders and brokers eager to make a bigger profit.&#8221; He declined to be interviewed for this story.</p>
<p><b>Easy Credit</b></p>
<p>But a close look at the network of organizations pushing for increased mortgage lending reveals a more complicated picture. Subprime-industry executives were advisers to the Hogar housing initiative, and bankrolled more than $2 million of its research. Lawmakers and advocacy groups pushed hard for the easy credit that fueled the subprime phenomenon among Latinos. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who received donations from the lending industry and saw their constituents moving into new homes, pushed for eased lending standards, which led to problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Congressional Hispanic Caucus created Hogar in 2003 to work with industry and community groups to increase mortgage lending to Latinos. At that time, the national Latino homeownership rate was 47%, compared with 68% for the overall population. Hogar called the figure &#8220;alarming,&#8221; and said a concerted effort was required to ensure that &#8220;by the end of the decade Latinos will share equally in the American Dream of homeownership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogar&rsquo;s backers included many companies that ran into trouble in mortgage markets: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both now under federal control; Countrywide Financial Corp., sold last year to Bank of America Corp.; Washington Mutual Inc., taken over by the government and sold to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.; and New Century Financial Corp. and Ameriquest Mortgage Corp., both now defunct.</p>
<p>Hogar&rsquo;s ties to the subprime industry were substantial. A Washington Mutual vice president served as chairman of its advisory committee. Companies that donated $150,000 a year got the right to place a research fellow who would conduct Hogar&rsquo;s studies, which were used by industry lobbyists. For donations of $100,000 a year, Hogar offered to provide news releases from the Hispanic Caucus promoting a lender&rsquo;s commercial products for the Latino market, according to the group&rsquo;s literature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, one of Hogar&rsquo;s sponsors, advised the group, shared research data and built a large membership to market loans to Latinos. By 2005, its ranks had grown to 16,000 agents and mortgage brokers.</p>
<p>The association, called Nahrep, received funding from some of the same players that funded Hogar. Some 22 corporate sponsors, including Countrywide and Washington Mutual, together paid the association $2 million a year to attend conferences and forums where lenders could pitch their loan products to loan brokers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Lenders&rsquo; Contributions</b></p>
<p>Countrywide and other sponsors contracted with Nahrep to set up regional events where they could present loan products to loan brokers and their customers. Mr. Sandos says his organization doesn&rsquo;t get paid to promote particular lenders.</p>
<p>At the height of the subprime lending boom, in 2005, banking and finance companies gave at least $2.3 million in campaign contributions to members of the Hispanic Caucus, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
<p>In October 2008, a charitable foundation set up by Mr. Baca received $25,000 from AmeriDream Inc., a nonprofit housing company and Hogar sponsor. Mr. Baca has long backed AmeriDream&rsquo;s controversial seller-financed down-payment assistance program. AmeriDream provided down-payment money to buyers, a cost that was covered by home builders in the form of donations to the nonprofit.</p>
<p>New housing legislation last fall outlawed the program. Mr. Baca is cosponsoring a bill that would allow AmeriDream and similar nonprofits to resume arranging seller-financed down-payment assistance to low-income Federal Housing Administration borrowers.</p>
<p>Such seller-financed loans comprise one-third of the loans backed by the FHA, and have defaulted at nearly triple the rate of other FHA-insured loans, according to agency spokesman William Glavin.</p>
<p>In a news release, AmeriDream said the donation to Mr. Baca&rsquo;s foundation was intended to fund the purchase of gear for firefighters in his district. Local news reports say the foundation gave away $36,000 in scholarships this year.</p>
<p>Internal Revenue Service records indicate that Mr. Baca&rsquo;s son, Joe Baca Jr., has an annual salary of $51,800 as executive director of the Joe Baca Foundation, which is run out of the congressman&rsquo;s home. Joe Baca Jr. says he currently is taking only about half that listed salary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mortgage lending to Hispanics took off between 2004 and 2007, powered by nonprime loans. The biggest jump occurred in 2005. The 169% increase in nonprime mortgages to Hispanics that year outpaced a 122% gain for blacks, and a 110% increase for whites, according to a Journal analysis of mortgage-industry and federal-housing data. Nonprime mortgages carry high interest rates and are tailored to borrowers with low credit scores or few assets.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2007, black borrowers were offered nonprime loans at a slightly higher rate than Hispanics, but the overall number of Hispanic borrowers was much larger. From 2004 to 2005, total nonprime home loans to Hispanics more than tripled to $69 billion from $19 billion, and peaked in 2006 at $73 billion.</p>
<p><b>Tricks of the Trade</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Representatives of subprime lenders passed on &#8220;little tricks of the trade&#8221; to get borrowers qualified, he says, such as adding a borrower&rsquo;s name to a relative&rsquo;s bank account, an illegal maneuver. Mr. Nguygn says he&rsquo;s now volunteering time to help borrowers facing foreclosure negotiate with banks.</p>
<p>Many loans to Hispanic borrowers were based not on actual income histories but on a borrower&rsquo;s &#8220;stated income.&#8221; These so-called no-doc loans yielded higher commissions and involved less paperwork.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By late 2008, one in every nine households in San Joaquin County, Calif., was in default or foreclosure &mdash; 24,049 of them, according to Federal Reserve data. Banks have already taken back 55 of every 1,000 homes. In Riverside, Calif., 66,838 houses are owned by banks or were headed in that direction as of October. In Prince William County, Va., a Washington suburb, 11,685 homes, or one in 11, was in default or foreclosure.</p>

		<p>And guess what folks? A &#8220;high browed&#8221; Hispanic ethnocentric special interest group in Los Angeles (financed by the usual corporate suspects) is preparing for a SECOND ROUND of fomenting mortgage lending activities to the &#8220;underserved&#8221; Hispanic population in this country! </p>

		<p>A lot of these peoples &#8216;inability to pay&rsquo; happened after they realized they were paying more money for a house than it was worth (after home prices declined). Was unemployment up before the housing crisis began?</p>

		<p>Invoking a society of rainbow coalitionists just about brought down the world financial market, and it may just complete the job in the next two years.</p>
<p>The lenders are greedy corporate crooks that have no morals or ethics and most of them should be in jail, not getting baled out, but it was the people pushing for sub-prime loans that are really responsible for the havoc.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, diversity is dangerous and a recipe for disaster.  It was the multicults who finally brought down the American Empire with their insane notions of trying to make a United Nations out of the United States.</p>
<p>Well, what they&rsquo;ve accomplished is to set back the globalist, new world order crowd about 100 years or more.  Instead of a global population in the US, we&rsquo;re going to have a global slugfest to see who comes out as the victor and gets the most territory:  Whites, blacks or Mestizos.  The other races don&rsquo;t have enough soldiers yet.  And in the process of it all, we will be scattered about into various nation states, all via the process of seceding&hellip;.and probably civil war.</p>
<p>The New World Order is now the Degenerating World Order, and it&rsquo;s going to continue that way.  Years of preaching against a one world government by 100&rsquo;s of high profile talkmeisters and writers couldn&rsquo;t stop the New World Order from progressing toward their rainbow utopia.  It was the multicults themselves that finally brought them to the point of eminent destruction.</p>
<p>So to the corporate greed mongers who sold out their people in favor of multiculturalism to satisfy their avarice, let me just say I hope you enjoy your utopia now.  It is causing your decline, and it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch.</p>
<p>And the good news?  More of the same is on the way.</p>
<p>After that?  Well, I guess it&rsquo;s pitchforks at the entrance of your gated communities.  Unfortunately for you, that&rsquo;s the good news, too.</p>

		<p>Liberal have been denying any relevance of minority lending to the current banking crisis.  But this evidence makes it hard to ignore.  A feckless political class pushed these lending standards and turned a blind eye to caution.  What should have been a normal recession is now a worldwide global meltdown.  Notice that some of the more liberal members in society have taken the biggest hits because they wanted to believe this fairy tale.  There is a 50-50 chance this will bring down our government.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the Hispanic homeowners, I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the banks, and I certainly don&rsquo;t feel sorry for white America.  We&rsquo;ve sat idle for the past 45+ years while the wheeling and dealing has been going on at our expense.  We idiots, yes us whites, are the biggest fools and the biggest losers.  And, as in Kevin Myers article posted to Amren on this same day, we whites were warned and it is now unstoppable.</p>
<p>Stay happy, cause the best is yet to come and won&rsquo;t that be fine&hellip;.. too?<br/>

		<p>I am surprised that the &#8220;open borders&#8221; Wall Street Journal would print such a revealing story as it undercuts their &#8220;all immigrants are wonderful&#8221; propaganda.  GW Bush is as guilty as the rest of the parties mentioned and even bragged about the increasing minority home ownership percentages in some recent State of the Union addresses. </p>
<p>There should be some formal inquiries and jail time for the perpetrators.  However, we will have to be satisfied with a one trillion dollar stimulus / bailout package proposed by Obama that will bankrupt the nation.</p>

		<p>While the banks and politicians in both the USA and the UK, etc are to be held accountable for the current credit crisis, ordinary ignorant borrowers are also just as guilty guilty.   Why did these people take out loans and run up incredible credit card debts that they should have known they may default on if they they were not in secure employment, if there is such a thing.  </p>
<p>In the UK, a new friend ofg mine who until recvently worked for a large UK bank, but has moved to Spain now, advised me that part of his job was to check and approve/reject mortgage applications.  He says he was told on many occasions to approve applications for up to 150% of the property value by his managers (all on commission of course) even though the application proved that say 60% was risky.  </p>
<p>Many of the applicants were &#8220;partners&#8221;; not married, that modern curse where couples do not commit proving to me a lack of moral intention.</p>
<p>Crimes such as bank-robbing are going to increase dramatically from now as many lose their homes and jobs andlame the banks for what in mnay cases is their own financial mismanagement.</p>

		<p>When I read stories like this I feel deep resentment. I probably spent $150 K more than I should have for my Bay Area home in 2002 because I was competing with immigrants and minorities bidding up prices while accessing no doc, NINA, or pay option ARM mortgages. Silly me. I spent 8 years living in a Berkeley rental saving up for a 20% down payment, which now, 7 years later, is the only thing keeping my mortgage above water. If I lose my job in the Diversity Recession and have to walk away from my home in the next few years, I&rsquo;m ruined. I was born into New Frontier America, believing my birthright was to do at least as well as my middle class parents, while living in an orderly safe community. I&rsquo;m likely to die in penury, a stranger in a strange and violent land, in spite of working hard and playing by the rules. Turns out I&rsquo;m just another pathetic sucker taxpayer playing caretaker while our nation is being turned over to the children of third world invaders. </p>

Posted by Joe B. at 3:01 AM on January 6</p>
<p>Calling our predicament the Diversity Recession is about the most apt term I think I&rsquo;ve heard or read about so far, because it is INDEED a diversity recession, although the PC crowd is trying its best to turn the blame elsewhere, as they always do.  They&rsquo;re masters of lies and deceit, while the conservatives are just too uptight and narrow to be able to fight them back with the same kind of psychological warfare.</p>
<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s up to us, the rank and file, to keep the real reason for this economic calamity in the forefront of any discussion.</p>
<p>Having traitors like this Karl Rove pushing for amnesty in order to get more votes from mestizos doesn&rsquo;t help either.  He&rsquo;s a fool and an incompetent and knows nothing beyond facts and figures.  The left eats him alive using manipulations, lies, and deceit and the fool hasn&rsquo;t a clue. </p>
<p>The Republicans are too spineless to employ the same tactics, calling this situation a Diversity Recession,&#8221; but they could constantly refer to it as a Democrat Fiasco, but they&rsquo;re too spineless for that also, plus they&rsquo;re just not clever enough to utilize psychological warfare.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with you, A Reader, on this&hellip;  I believe that most of our politicians are not blind at all.  In fact, these characters know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing!</p>
<p>Our politicians work for the corporations, and wide open borders are the order of the day!  These wide open borders will soon lead to the so-called &#8220;need&#8221; for a North American Union.  This &#8220;union&#8221; would allow for the &#8220;free flow of goods, services and people.&#8221;  </p>
<p>This new North American Union, being enhanced through the SPP &#8220;treaty&#8221; which was signed by President Bush, Prime Minister Paul Martin and President Fox in the spring of 2005 without our knowledge or consent, would be great for the ever-deepening pockets of the global corporations and their bought-and-paid-for global politicians but a total disaster for the people!</p>
<p>Ah&hellip;  The glories of diversity, multiculturalism and globalism&hellip;  These praises of &#8220;global glory&#8221; are leading us straight to a &#8220;global society.&#8221; A global society would probably require some sort of a global government.  Since a global government or a world government sounds too &#8220;harsh,&#8221; our fellow ruling class members in Europe would rather call it a &#8220;world governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans needs to wake up and fight for our rights and our sovereignty now before our borders completely dissolve into a North American Union which would then eventually evolve into a New World Order.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the Clinton Administration was threatening mortgage lenders with civil rights violations, if they didn&rsquo;t make these risky loans.</p>
<p>This is just another example of the destruction of the middle class and the new rich, which have come from the middle class. You don&rsquo;t see people like the Clintons, Bushes, Kennedy, McCain and others of the Washington crowd losing their homes. Theses people would like nothing more than to turn the clock back to the days of the Great Gatsby, when there was no middleclass and the workers lived in slums and squallier<br/>

		<p>Never underestimate the roles of Jack Kemp or Grover Norquist in all this.  Their idea of &#8220;empowerment&#8221; during the Nineties proved to be the basis for George W. Bush/Karl Rove&rsquo;s &#8220;ownership society&#8221; campaign this decade.  This campaign didn&rsquo;t buy Hispanic or black votes (as could have been predicted); it merely hastened the GOP&rsquo;s demise. </p>

		<p>This is truly amazing.  Who would have thought that American blacks, Hispanics, and their diversity-minded enablers could have brought down the entire world financial system.</p>
<p>And the when the average man on the street in China, Djakarta, or Bombay figures this out, that we poured botulism into the world banking network and pulled them down with us, the feeling in the rest of the world toward this country will be less than charitable.</p>
<p>Big trouble ahead, and not just of the financial variety.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip;I think the blame has to be spread around equally. Greed all over. The whole housing crisis reflects a decline in American morals all over - not just blacks and Hispanics. Banks were falling all over themselves to lend to shaky borrowers, virtually knocking on doors in the ghetto and handing out checks. In the foolish belief that the boom would go on forever.</p>
<p>Well, those minorities had nothing to lose, anyway. But those who did, have lost BIG.</p>

		<p>I cannot agree with you, A Reader, on this… I believe that most of our politicians are not blind at all. In fact, these characters know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing!</p>

<p>Thanks. I did not mean the political &#8220;elites&#8221; when I wrote &#8220;politically blind&#8221;. I referred to tens of millions Americans who do seem to believe in the immigration/diversity/equal outcomes mantras.<br/>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that much of what drives housing prices is the <br/>
desire to escape from unpleasant minority populations and <br/>
all of the diversity they provide.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for people who went deeply into debt to escape<br/>
from the multicultural hell that much of the country is<br/>
becoming.  </p>
<p>And the price of escaping is ever higher with all of the<br/>
subsidies provided to unpleasant minorities.</p>
<p>One must never forget that one of the ironclad laws of this<br/>
this world is that you get more of what you subsidize <br/>
and less of what you tax.</p>

		<p>Jackers&hellip;you nailed it. Exactly the plan. Google Agenda 21, think of all the bike paths, light rail and sustainable neighborhoods. The agenda is to remove our property rights and make all property government owned. The UN feels that we should share our land with those less fortunate.</p>

		<p>Americans who paid for things their whole lives with honest money should think about this story. Hispanics demanded and got home loans they could not pay for. As I&rsquo;ve written in the past, imagine the number of honest, hardworking Americans, who for years, tried to get a loan for a house and just couldn&rsquo;t get that 20percent down. It should make you sick, if you&rsquo;re a fair minded person.</p>

		<p>So if bankers didn&rsquo;t give Hispanics a mortgage, they&rsquo;d be accused of racism.  But once they do and the hispanics can&rsquo;t pay back the loans, now it&rsquo;s considered &#8220;taking advantage&#8221; or &#8220;being greedy&#8221;.  You can&rsquo;t win, can you?</p>

		<p>It was this pandering to non-Whites, namely Blacks and Hispanics, giving them loans to houses they couldn&rsquo;t afford, that has had a big impact in causing the current economic crisis.</p>

<p>That, I am afraid, is exactly the point, rather than an unintended consequence.  Social engineering experiments, when they require the active cooperation of private enterprise instead of merely government agencies, always require trapping the principals in Catch-22s.</p>
