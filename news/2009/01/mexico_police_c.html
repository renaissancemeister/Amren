			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of a Mexican police chief was delivered to his colleagues in an ice box in the country&rsquo;s latest drug-related violence.</p>
<p>The incident came as 16 other people were also killed in Mexico&rsquo;s northern state of Chihuahua in attacks the authorities believe are linked to the country&rsquo;s drug wars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hitmen cut off commander Martin Castro&rsquo;s head and left it in an ice cooler in front of the local police station,&#8221; said a statement issued by the state justice authorities.</p>
<p>His head was left in the town Praxedis with a message from the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel.</p>
<p>The police commander was abducted on Saturday, along with five other police officers and a civilian, only five days after starting his job.</p>
<p>Six bodies in police uniforms bearing signs of torture and gunshot wounds were found on Monday in a street in the state capital, Chihuahua, officials said.</p>
<p>Hitmen killed four men in separate attacks in the violent border city of Ciudad Juarez, while six others, including a woman, were found dead in other towns across the state.</p>
<p>Mexican police and soldiers are battling a wave of drug-related violence across the country, particularly in northern areas bordering the US, with more than 5,300 people killed last year.</p>
<p>The federal government launched a campaign against drug-related violence more than two years ago involving the deployment of around 36,000 troops across the country.<br>

			<p>Mexico always objects when we execute one of their illegals in our country who kills. They insist that we always obey their laws when we are in their country, but they hypocritically want us to treat them differently because they are Mexicans.They have no principles.</p>

			<p>These are the kinds of people that U.S. Democrats, Republicans, and egalitarians are importing around the clock to a town near you&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;or perhaps to your town and maybe even next door to you.</p>

			<p>Not a big deal.  Mexicans are fugible.  It&rsquo;s not like his collegues missed his sparkling wit or banter.</p>

			<p>The people who care so much can end this. The solution lies with liberals and people of color, just like they say it does. Liberals can fix this themselves. The people who care can end this madness. All of it. All they have to do is stop using illegal drugs. </p>

			<p>Coming soon to America.  The murders of US police and citizens is comparable to Iraq in same time period. Count the DUI&rsquo;s, the brutal murders of police, rape/murders of women &amp; children.  I see the beasts everyday and it is nothing to compare with US people and way of life.   US does not owe Mexico anything.  Mexicans are doing what they do best: blackmail extortion &amp; kidknapping US.  I fear for my life  because there has been no federal support for protection!  V</p>

			<p>Perhaps Mexico should be the next Iraq with this real threat on the US&rsquo;s doorstep, an evil that the elected government (of Mexico) seems unable to eliminate for good?   To kill a police chief in such a way is a major challenge to the legal and democratically elected authorities there and should bring down the full wrath of the Mexican Govt. using even the armed forces to overrun the drug barons&rsquo; strongholds showing no mercy, even if they, like the Palestinians, use women and children as barriers hoping that the forces of good will not then attack.</p>
<p>It is now a good excuse for the USA to actively aid the Mexican Government and simultaneously to show that real business is meant against the illegal immigrants from Mexico and to blazes with what the jaw-tank in the UN says.</p>
<p>I am now glad I was born 71 years ago when men had honour and patriotism with the will to actively take a stand against the evil beings in our World.  Unless that spirit returns, the future does not look good at all.</p>

			<p>Only a matter of time (a VERY short time) before we read about this exact kind of violence happening in OUR border towns.</p>

			<p>This story sounds like a grear argument for advocating open borders. That way the bad guys (drug lords) would find better places to stash the heads of their victims   &mdash;   what with thousands of square miles just north of the border for disposing of bodies.</p>

			<p>There are two things that are coming to your community in the future: 1) Mexican immigrants and this sort of violence.  2) Confiscation of privately owned guns by the Federal Government. </p>

			<p>The U.S. Marines (probably all U.S. military) have been told they can no longer go to Tijuana. Saw this on the FOX News a couple of days ago!</p>

B.J.Deller<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
In fact, Mexico should have been BEFORE Iraq.</p>
<p>(But of course, that would never have happened under <br>
El Presidente Jorge Dubya Booosh.  His Mexican sister-in-law, Columba, would not stand for it.)<br>
