			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nathan B (Analyst), Bleacher Report, January 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I am sickened at what I witnessed yesterday in the match-up between the Houston Cougars and the Arizona Wildcats.  When you view this clip (courtesy of YouTube and Rivals.com), I imagine you might feel the same. My stomach literally churns when I see it.</p>
<p>In the second half of a game that Houston was dominating, the Cougars&rsquo; Aubrey Coleman was called for a charge after shoving Arizona&rsquo;s Chase Budinger to the floor while dribbling past the half-court line.</p>
<p>After the whistle, Coleman continued to walk forward and proceeded to intentionally stomp directly on the face of Budinger. It wasn&rsquo;t an accident; the video clearly shows Coleman walking straight over to Budinger and using force to plant his red and white Nike right into Budinger&rsquo;s craw.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Coleman then strolled away with a grin the Cheshire Cat would be envious of and received several accolades and high-fives from his teammates. Apparently, in Houston, you are to be congratulated for intentionally leaving an imprint of your shoe size on an opponent&rsquo;s face. Very classy, Cougars.</p>
<p>This incident is perhaps the most unsportsmanlike conduct I have ever witnessed on the court of a college basketball game.</p>
<p>Though Coleman was ejected for the &#8220;flagrant foul,&#8221; that punishment is not nearly enough. He deserves a minimum ten-game suspension, but my recommendation is that his season ends today. The NCAA must send a clear, strong signal that this type of behavior will not be tolerated and will be met with the harshest of sanctions.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s coach Tom Penders surely would take the time to apologize after the game, right? Not a chance.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Penders&rsquo; response: &#8220;I&rsquo;m just sorry the official interpreted it that way. The way I saw it, Aubrey got tangled and his momentum carried him forward and I think it was a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a mistake for sure, but not one that had anything to do with entanglement or momentum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give Penders the benefit of the doubt and assume he hadn&rsquo;t yet seen the video.  If he has seen the video and still has the same sentiments, then he is just as classless as Coleman. In fact, maybe he should be suspended for a game too since he could be held accountable for creating an environment where this type of play is acceptable.</p>
<p>Not that they need any further motivation, but the NCAA may also wish to nip this incident in the bud due to the possibility of racial undertones surfacing.</p>
<p>I am not at all insinuating that Coleman stomped Budinger because he was white, but &#8220;foot-stomping&#8221; has culturally had racial implications in America, and the incident has the possibility of being interpreted in that manner. There will also be the inevitable arguments that start with, &#8220;If Coleman had been white and Budinger had been black &hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>Unlikely as it is, the last thing college basketball needs is any type of &#8220;race war&#8221;.</p>
<p>As to the final outcome of the game, score one for karma. Houston went on to lose 96-90 in overtime despite dominating the game up until the incident.</p>
<p>The NCAA needs to move immediately and forcefully to make it clear that this must never happen again.</p>
<p>Update 1: Since this article was written, an apology was issued by Aubrey Coleman.  The story with his statement can be read here. The apology, while certainly the right thing to do, does not change my mind on the punishment.</p>
<p>If he was truly &#8220;sorry from the bottom of his heart,&#8221; then he should have apologized on the spot, after the game or that night. I am not in his heart or mind, so I can&rsquo;t say whether he is only sorry because he realizes he might be in for a big-time suspension. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder.</p>
<p>Update 2: In the last couple of hours (on the evening of Jan. 26), the University of Houston issued a statement that they were suspending Coleman for an additional one game, the upcoming game against UTEP, and that they now &#8220;consider the case closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see. It appears that most people feel the punishment to be wholly inadequate, and the NCAA could still weigh in.</p>
<p>Update 3: Actually, I updated my article incorrectly. UH actually took NO action against either Penders or Coleman. CUSA is the one who suspended him for a game, and they actually are basically &#8220;forced&#8221; to issue a suspension by their own rules, so this was the minimum punishment he could have received. The statement that &#8220;the case is considered closed&#8221; was correctly attributed to UH however.</p>
<p>No further statement from Penders or the NCAA to this point, though  &mdash;  just the statement from CUSA and UH.</p>

<p>[Aubrey] Coleman, a junior and the team&rsquo;s second-leading scorer, was ejected after stepping on [Chase] Budinger&rsquo;s face following a charge call with 9:51 left in the second half. Arizona rallied for a 96-90 win in overtime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to apologize to Chase Budinger for what happened Saturday night. I never meant to step on him,&#8221; Coleman said in a statement issued by the school. &#8220;I have never been in an incident like this before, and I have nothing but respect for him as a great player.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the game too much to do something like that intentionally. I want to say I am sorry from the bottom of my heart,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;I know that God knows what is in my heart, but I am hopeful that Chase will understand and forgive.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Well, Mr. Nathan B. might not be insinuating that this was a racial thing, but I am.  Plus the fact that we have a black President, I suppose Mr. Coleman thought that he could do what he wanted.</p>

			<p>I replayed the video several times yesterday.  It was deliberate.  The guy smiled, and if you play the video out you can see his team mates high fiving him.</p>
<p>It was deliberate.  </p>
<p>It was racially motivated.</p>
<p>He should be suspended.   </p>

			<p>Of course it was intentional. And his mealy-mouthed apology, with its appeal to God, marks him as a deceptive coward.</p>
<p>I believe it was John PM who said, some time ago, on this website, that Blacks would be emboldened by the election of Obama to show their hatred of Whites.</p>
<p>When he wrote those words, I immediately knew it was true.</p>
<p>This is a case in point.</p>
<p>There have been other cases  &mdash;  one in the city in which I live, in which Black gangers, in this instance, shot at a car on the interstate. Seems the car was driven by a White man who took exception to their careless driving.</p>
<p>White people need to brace themselves for more.   </p>

			<p>I watched the video. It may not have been deliberate, it didn&rsquo;t appear that he was looking toward Budinger&rsquo;s face when he stepped on it. But the shots of him smiling and at least one of his (black) teammates clearly &#8220;high fiving&#8221; him as they were splitting him and Budinger apart are certainly damning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that if it was found to be deliberate, the NCAA should offer an ultimatum: Coleman&rsquo;s off the team, permanently, or the Cougars are out of the league, permanently (assuming it can actually work that way).</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think an apology is enough.  I mean, blacks don&rsquo;t forgive whites when we say something they don&rsquo;t like, so I don&rsquo;t see how this black guy should be scott free when stepped on someone&rsquo;s face.  </p>

<p>Yes it looked deliberate. Coleman charged Budinger, knocking him to the floor and a foul was rightly called. Coleman keeps walking forward, knowing there is a man laying on the floor in front of him. WHY???&hellip;He could have easily walked around the downed player. He then &#8220;steps&#8221; very hard onto Budinger&rsquo;s face and acts like he was tripping at that point. He wasnt very convincing IMO. </p>
<p>I too would suspend Coleman for the rest of the year if not permanently. Remember, the refs threw him out of the game. It was obvious to them that this was intentional. Had it been done accidentally, there would be no reason to eject Coleman.</p>
<p> Even if coleman was permanently baaned from college sports, he&rsquo;d probably get picked up by an nba team, since they seem to love black thugs. </p>

			<p>Was it deliberate?  If it were a white player stepping on a black player&rsquo;s head, there would be no doubt that it was deliberate, and Jesse Jackson would be there on every news station demanding action from the NCAA.  </p>
<p>Blacks are experts at &#8216;accidentally&rsquo; bumping into people while intentionally looking the other way.  I&rsquo;ve seen this tactic many times.  It&rsquo;s a game they play.  When you fall to the ground, they throw their hands up and say, &#8216;Sorry, man, I din it see you.&rsquo;  And then laugh at you when they walk away.</p>
<p>This guy did it intentionally.  He a worse actor than Will Smith.</p>

			<p>Yes, it absolutely looked deliberate to me. I had to watch four or five times to catch it, but look how high Coleman lifts his foot, right before it comes down on Budinger&rsquo;s face. (You can see it especially clearly at the end of the clip, when they show the reverse angle.) </p>
<p>If Coleman really didn&rsquo;t see Budinger on the floor, his gait would have remained constant as he was walking off the momentum. The proof is in that final high-step.</p>

<p>Wake up buddy.</p>
<p>Coleman had no reason to do that.  There was no altercation at all beforehand.  Coleman was the one who charged Budinger.  After Budinger fell Mr. Coleman thought he&rsquo;d stomp on the &#8216;White boy&rsquo; some more.  Coleman did this because Obama be President now.  The attitude is showing itself even at this early stage.  Wait a couple of more years after the economy goes into a depression.  We&rsquo;re all going to be in a real pickle.  Some folks think the Black crime rate is high now.  Wait. </p>

			<p>It kind of looked deliberate to me.  I know the deep spite Blacks can reveal and the fact that he was high-fiving teammates right after this evil act leads me to believe he wanted to hurt &#8220;Da Whiteboy&#8221; in some kind of fashion.  The depths of Black spite are no longer an abnormality of uncivility.  I&rsquo;ve witnessed their acts of deliberate, savage intent -and it&rsquo;s not accidental!</p>

			<p>One angle it looks like it might be deliberate, from another it appears there&rsquo;s no doubt. To me it appears deliberate, as he looked down, then looked straight ahead and stepped on Budinger. I think Coleman was trying to act like it was an accident. If you watch the main video that&rsquo;s been played (go to youtube, they&rsquo;re still playing the full length video) you can see Coleman getting high-fived by his teammates after the incident. Too bad Budinger didn&rsquo;t have Rick Barry&rsquo;s temper. Coleman would have discovered six teeth missing after he woke up in an ambulance. </p>

<i>I saw the video. It might not have been deliberate. Did anyone else see it? Did it look deliberate to you?</i></p>
<p>OK, lets think about this. The video showed Coleman looking down just before the incident, so he knew exactly where Budinger was. Let&rsquo;s say his &#8220;momentum&#8221; <i>was</i> carrying him forward (although it didn&rsquo;t look like it). Wouldn&rsquo;t he have still known that he was walking on someone? How could you walk on someone without knowing about it (especially when you have to catch your balance)? Then, if you did walk on someone, wouldn&rsquo;t you have wanted to turn around to see what happened? Would it be possible to walk on someone and be totally oblivious to it? Especially when you knew that you had just knocked someone down in the first place???? Not hardly. This was a clear case of a black feeling cocky and thinking he could get away with it.</p>

			<p>Here is an exchange between Coleman and Sportscaster Dedalus.</p>
<p>D:What do you have to say to Chase Budinger?<br>
C:I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it.<br>
D:Well, if you didn&rsquo;t mean to do it, why are you apologizing?<br>
C:<br>
D:Are you aware that after your actions, and with this &#8220;apology&#8221;, you are perceived as a Coward and a Liar?<br>
C:<br>
D:Are you also aware that this validates the perception most Whites have, but are not allowed to talk about owing to Political Correctness?<br>
C: <br>
D:Are you also aware of the fact that your cheap and obvious attempt to hide your actions, their motives, and your phoney apology, behind the word God marks you as an irredeemable cad, a pre-adolescent, and a sociopath?<br>
C:<br>
D:In fact, take us through the event.  You be Chase, and I&rsquo;ll be you. So, on the ground ya go.  There we are.  Ok, now, look away from me&hellip;that&rsquo;s it.  Ok, and so, then, no, keep looking the other way.  Ya see, the idea is that you are not at all prepared for it because, of course, you would never think in a million years that anyone would do such a thing and then pretend they didn&rsquo;t know they were doing it, though they want their buddies to know&hellip;.</p>
<p>Ahh, the fantasy continues.</p>

			<p>Here in Europe and especially the UK, to do such an act while playing sport often results in a criminal charge being brought by the police.  Surely it must be the same in the USA?  All it takes is for someone to file a report with the police and the evidence looks to be there of assault and grievous bodily harm (or whatver te equivalent is in the USA)in this case.   It makes so called sportsmen think twice (desist) before they do it especially with TV cameras on them for proof.</p>

			<p>Oh COME ON!! Now I seriously have to wonder about some AmRen posters. I didn&rsquo;t need to see the video more than once. Of course COLEMAN STEPPED ON BUDINGERS FACE ON PURPOSE!!! It is so obvious on the video. At first before viewing the video, I assumed this took place during the action on the court. There is no action going on. He deliberately decided to step on a guys face who is down on the floor. Coleman deserved to get a reply, a very hard reply, not because he&rsquo;s black, but because he&rsquo;s a punk and a thug.</p>

			<p>Many years ago, a cop at a hockey game made an arrest right on the ice.  The cop said, &#8220;I know an assault when I see one&#8221;.  Deliberately stepping on someone&rsquo;s face is not unsportsmanlike, it&rsquo;s criminal.  </p>

			<p>If a white player did this on film to a black player, would blacks be debating online whether it was somehow an accident?</p>
<p>here is a handy dandy rule of thumb:</p>
<p>When you step on someone&rsquo;s face, it is always deliberate.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad Nathan B. wrote this opinion piece.  Stepping on Budinger&rsquo;s face definitely was deliberate.  If it were an accident, Coleman would have been horrified once he realized what he had done and would not be smiling and exulting with his teammates.  This is horrible sportsmanship.  Mr. Budinger&rsquo;s neck could have been broken and thank God it wasn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>The other poster is right about aggressive blacks who pretend to &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bump into a person so as to inflict pain.  You can see this in junior high and beyond.  </p>
<p>Remember the AmRen January 16 news excerpt about Mychal Bell of Jena 6 notoriety?  In his recent arrest for shoplifting he was pulled out from under a car where he was hiding and &#8220;accidentally&#8221; elbowed the security guard in the face!</p>

			<p>The point of whether this was &#8220;Deliberate&#8221; or not is a moot one if you ask me.  As someone who absolutely does not watch, financially support or basically condone these thugs and their &#8220;thug&#8221; lifestyles who now go under the guise of &#8220;professional&#8221; athletes, I find it interesting that it is Whites who seem to be predominantly the ones basically financially supporting these thugs to act in this manner and condoning such behavior.</p>
<p>If we go back to the comments made last year during election season when the Black player made the comment during the playing of the National Anthem that he didn&rsquo;t support that &#8220;s$%$&#8221; and &#8220;Obama 08&#8221; etc, as well as the ongoing countless arrests and assorted thuggery of overwhelmingly and predominantly Black athletes in general, it seems that claiming to support &#8220;Race Realism&#8221; and then watching, or actively financially supporting through ticket sales, game attendance, merchandising, etc. and, in effect, CONDONING such thuglike behavior in Black-dominated sports is more than a tad hypocritical of all of us. </p>
<p>To watch a bunch of Blacks (overwhelmingly) running back and forth trying to put a ball in a hoop&hellip; ostensibly adult men playing what basically amounts to a children&rsquo;s game&hellip; sorry, it&rsquo;s just never really seemed much like entertainment to me.</p>
<p>Try Boxing, UFC or MMA instead.  These are the sports that REALLY matter when it comes to overall athleticism and physical conditioning not to mention the exhibition of the far more admirable qualities of Will, Courage, Fortitude and Spirit over simply a child&rsquo;s talent for putting a ball through a hoop.  These are also the sports that you will find Whites dominate &hellip;and historically have dominated&hellip; and will continue to dominate&hellip; completely.<br>

			<p>It was deliberate, it was obvious, it was racial and it was disgusting.  How anyone can say it wasn&rsquo;t is beyond me&hellip;</p>

			<p>It was deliberate, it was hate and it was just an example of things to come. We have a &#8216;black massa&rsquo; now and, the low IQ will come to the top with their hands out and their hate inflamed. What they don&rsquo;t understand is this Massa is only half black and wants another 4 years&hellip;..as does his wife. His mind is not on the parasites.</p>

			<p>What Coleman did was deliberate and was done for partly racial reasons.  Just as interesting was that none of Budinger&rsquo;s black teammates retaliated.  If I&rsquo;d had been on the court and my teammate, white or black, had his head stomped, my fists would be flying.  But the black Arizona teammates seemed relieved that order was restored by the officials.</p>

			<p>I suggest to all friends of american Renaissance to e-mail Dr. Renn Khator, the president of the Univeristy of Houston and ask for the suspension of coleman and the firing of Coach Tom Penders.</p>

			<p> I agree with the writer: Coleman should be suspended without pay for the rest of the season.</p>
<p> Those of you who are basketball fans with long memories may remember an incident that happened between a southern college (may have been Wake Forest) and the University of Minnesota, either in the late 1970s or early &rsquo;80s. A black player from the southern school knocked a White player from Minnesota down; then extended his hand to him to supposedly &#8220;help him up;&#8221; then after the White player had grasped his hand and was halfway up off the floor and in a vulnerable position, the black kneed him in the groin. After the White player collapsed in agony on the floor, the black then stomped on his head   &mdash;   two or three times.</p>
<p> There was a certain hue and cry about it   &mdash;   I believe Howard Cosell even criticized the black player (only time he ever did that to one of his beloved blacks, that I can remember); but the black never really got the punishment he deserved. Can you imagine if the perpetrator had been White, and the victim black, in either case? The blacks and White bleeding hearts would have had a conniption, demanded criminal charges, etc.</p>

			<p>Stop watching these Black dominated sports.  All you do is make these overrated thugs rich.  We stopped watching years ago.  There are a lot of wonderful White sports out there which represent our talents better anyway.</p>

			<p>Do you know whose fault this real is? It&rsquo;s white people&rsquo;s fault. Specifically, the white fan of the NBA, NFL, MLB, NCAA. I have been saying for years that we should all boycott these leagues permanently. Sometimes I get agreements from friends of mine after incidents like this one yet not a couple of days later they&rsquo;re all still fretting over injury reports or pitching rotations or something. </p>
<p>The seeming good news is that we seem to have gotten to a tipping point. The comments on these sites are overwhelmingly in our favor and people are starting not to be afraid of saying the racial truth. Many have even stopped qualifying their statements with &#8220;Uh&hellip;I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;uh&hellip;maybe&hellip; and the like.<br>
This is all good. the next step is to get whites to stop spending their money, time and energy on these sports and get them to do other things instead, like get in shape and form informal all-white leagues in the park, especially for the kids.<br>
Aubrey Coleman and his friends may have done us a big favor. Spread the word: NO MORE BLACK OR HISPANIC DOMINATED SPORTS!</p>

			<p>To Wayne Engle:</p>
<p>I know the incident you are referring to. It was around 1973, if memory serves me; Ohio State at Minnesota. Minnesota players Ron Behagen and Corky Taylor deliberately stomped on Ohio State&rsquo;s Luke Witte, after Ohio State concluded a 10-0 run that gave them the lead. As I recall, Behagen and Taylor were suspended by the Big 10, but Minnesota coach Bill Musselman never formally apologized.</p>

<p>I never watch college or pro basketball - too boring and too slow, what with all the timeouts.</p>

			<p>This was 100% deliberate.  Coleman is an athlete at the peak of his performance capabilities.  The game requires an ability to quickly scan and process the complete visual environment (hence Coleman knew exactly where Budinge was). These guys have exceptional eye-to-body coordination and spatial knowledge of body position (hence, he knew exactly where his foot was).  Coleman is extremely fit and athletic, and hence could have easily jumped, extended, twisted, or otherwise maneuvered so as not to step on Budinger&rsquo;s face. My God, I&rsquo;ve seen these guys twist and jump and move with incredible finesse and speed. In the least, he could have broken the step by falling away from Budinger   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve done this when I&rsquo;ve accidentally started to step on the cat, and I&rsquo;m 50 yrs old.  If I can do it, why couldn&rsquo;t a highly trained athlete do it?  Don&rsquo;t tell me that Coleman suddenly lost all of his athletic skills and suddenly reverted to the athletic ability of a 70-yr-old man.  </p>
<p>But the real proof is in how he acted immediately after committing the crime.  You or I would have immediately turned and apologized.  Instead, Coleman grinned and high-fived.  </p>

			<p>In 1971, Ohio State had been a perennial top-flight Big Ten basketball team and was generally a white team.  Its two stars were center Luke Witte and guard Alan Hornyak.  Minnesota had been a doormat in the Big Ten for years but had hired disciplinarian Bill Musselman from the junior-college ranks.  He recruited several black junior-college players and the team was black-oriented.  The Minnesota team was known for its rough, aggressive play, a style Musselman continued during his nomadic coaching career.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the big Ohio State-Minnesota game in Minneapolis was heavy with raw emotion.  However, the visiting Buckeyes led by about five points when Witte was roughly fouled during a fast break with about one minute left.  Minnesota&rsquo;s Corky Taylor pretended to help Witte from the floor but as he raised Witte, Taylor kneed Witte in the white man&rsquo;s privates, knocking the wind out of Witte.  Minnesota star Ron Behagen then ran to where Witte was sprawled and began to jump on Witte three or four times.  Taylor chased a white defender(sadly pathetic) of Witte down the court and a melay began.  One of the worst brawlers was a Minnesota reserve named Dave Winfield who sucker-punched one of Ohio State&rsquo;s smaller white players.  Winfield is today enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Witte, a religious sort, did not press charges although he lost some of his eyesight.  The late Big Ten President Wayne Duke gave Taylor and Behagen slap-on-the-wrist penalties.  By an odd coincidence, Witte and Behagen, both journeyman NBA players, played for a while on the Cleveland Caviliers in the mid-70s.</p>

			<p>Blacks think basketball is their sport.  Hence, they feel entitled to step on Whitey&rsquo;s face.  Coleman and Penders should BOTH be barred from the NCAA for life.</p>
<p>Just because we have a mulatto Marxist in the White House (or is it the &#8220;Brown House&#8221; now?) doesn&rsquo;t entitle Blacks to assault Whites, let alone step on their faces.</p>

			<p>Blacks or anyone other than whites know they can get away with DOING anything. I&rsquo;ve been outraged for years that this society is all about words and paperwork with no action and no follow through. SAYING anything will suffice and make up for the wrongest of wrongs, seemingly. (Not where I come from.)</p>
<p>Everyone knows what&rsquo;s going on. Earlier there was no retaliation because of political correctness. Now there are laws against our taking up for ourselves.</p>
<p>I would have loved to have seen Budinger jump up tackle Coleman and beat the living daylights out of him. But, Budinger knows the world we live in. He&rsquo;s no animal. He&rsquo;s no wuss; but he&rsquo;s no fool, either.</p>
