<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/7844726.stm">Malaysia Bans Foreign Recruitment</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Malaysia has banned the hiring of new foreign workers in factories, shops and other services.</p>
<p>The government said the move was to protect its citizens from unemployment during the economic downturn.</p>
<p>It has also told employers that if they want to cut back their workforce they must sack foreign staff first.</p>
<p>Malaysia is a leading Asian importer of labour, with more than two million foreign workers  &mdash;  mostly from Indonesia and other South East Asian countries.</p>
<p>The ban on new foreign workers is indefinite and will affect key manufacturing and services sectors which currently employ about half of Malaysia&rsquo;s foreign workforce.</p>
<p>Exemptions may be given to those working in highly skilled service industries and factories.</p>
<p>The decision was announced late on Wednesday by the Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar.</p>
<p>Syed Hamid told the New Straits Times that the decision had been prompted by a human resources ministry report which showed 45,000 people would be laid off by the end of the month.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the time for employers to ask for foreign workers,&#8221; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first to be retrenched should be foreigners and not locals,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Employers have been told that foreigners already working in Malaysia will be allowed to remain until their contract expires or until they are laid off.</p>
<p>Eka Suripto, an official at the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, said up to one-third of its 300,000 nationals working in Malaysia&rsquo;s manufacturing industry could lose their jobs this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly what they will sacrifice first are the foreign migrants,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thirteen thousand workers lost their jobs in the last quarter  &mdash;  over 75% were Malaysian.</p>
<p>In a further sign that Malaysia&rsquo;s export dependent economy is being squeezed by the global economic downturn, some economists are projecting the country&rsquo;s growth rate could fall to below 2%.<br>

			<p>The multiculturalists are right.  We have a lot to learn from non white countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our newspapers run articles written by the local restaurant owners association about the shortage of labor on the same page with articles about state unemployment agencies online application websites crashing because so many newly unemployed are applying at the same time.</p>

			<p>Actually I don&rsquo;t think this is admirable at all.</p>
<p>Malaysia has a demographic problem   &mdash;  - Malays are less than 50% of the population. Chinese and Indians form the rest.</p>
<p>Importing Indonesians to Malaysia helps to FIX that problem. Malays and Indonesians speak the same language, follow the same religion, and have a very similar culture. (It&rsquo;s like Americans and Australians.) That&rsquo;s why Indonesians are such popular guest workers there. </p>
<p>But now the government are telling people to fire Indonesians (&#8220;foreigners&#8221;) and kick them out of the country to save jobs for Chinese and Indians (&#8220;Malaysian citizens&#8221;).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if America took in Afrikaner guest workers from South Africa, but then Washington deported them so that Mexican Americans could take their jobs.</p>

			<p>This should be forwarded to Steve Balmer, CEO of Microsoft.  He just laid off 1,400 in Seattle on Friday.</p>

			<p>Dubai, financial headquarters of the middle east is not waiting for the contracts to expire. They are canceling 4,000 work permit a day. Tough about your contract, better be on the next plane out.<br>
Saudi Arabia has warned employers that they are not allowed to lay off Saudi employees. When a country is no longer prepared to put their citizens first it deserves to be flushed down the toilets of history.</p>

			<p>If only the H-1Bs could be booted out; it would result in a miraculous increase in tech employment by US citizens. But, when did the US politicians like Obama ever care about the techy?</p>

			<p>Microsofe announced the impending cute of several thousand jobs!! I wonder if the H1-b jobs will be cut, the outsourced (to India usually) jobs or domestic, natural born American citizens??Keep watch on this, I personally bet it will be domestic American&rsquo;s jobs that get cut.</p>
