			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Coronation Street bosses covered up a cross during filming at a 14th century church  &mdash;  because they thought it may offend viewers.</p>
<p>The Rev. James Milnes said the producers asked for it to be removed entirely, but then settled on hiding it behind candles and flowers.</p>
<p>He described the request  &mdash;  made during the filming of Molly and Tyrone&rsquo;s wedding scenes  &mdash;  as a disgrace.</p>
<p>The cross was bolted down, so the soap&rsquo;s producers hid it behind candles and flowers for the scene, which was screened on Monday.</p>
<p>Rev Milnes said: &#8216;I can&rsquo;t imagine how people would be offended. It&rsquo;s a church  &mdash;  you expect to see a cross in there.</p>
<p>&#8216;You would expect to see the Koran in a film of a mosque, a menorah in a film of a synagogue and similarly a cross when filming a Christian church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Green from protest group Christian Voice said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8216;If you&rsquo;re going to film people getting married in a church, you&rsquo;re going to come across the odd cross, picture of Jesus or a stained glass window.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s this sort of stupidity that gives political correctness a bad name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Regan, a spokesman for the Diocese of Chester, said: &#8216;The cross is universally accepted as a symbol of Christianity, and should offend no one.</p>
<p>&#8216;Christianity and Christian characters are quite often featured in both Coronation Street and EastEnders, so why the makers of the Street should object to a cross featuring during a Christian wedding service does not make much sense.</p>
<p>&#8216;Certainly, Christians throughout the Diocese of Chester continue to revere the cross as a symbol of hope and faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 14th century church, in Nether Alderley, Cheshire, was paid £4,600 to be transformed into the wedding venue for filming in late November. </p>
<p>Granada arrived with a caravan of trailers, vans, their own security, a double- decker bus dining cart and more than 150 cast, crew and extras.</p>
<p>Soap bosses have admitted covering up the cross was an &#8216;error&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;We are looking into how and why this happened. </p>
<p>&#8216;We chose the church because the characters of Molly and Tyrone wanted a traditional religious church wedding service in a quintessentially English church.</p>
<p>&#8216;Covering up the cross was an error and we apologise for any upset this has caused.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rev Milnes, 29, who doesn&rsquo;t watch the soap, said: &#8216;I want us to spend the full sum of £4,600 on a handmade silver processional cross.</p>
<p>&#8216;I want us to say that the cross was obscured, which is a disgrace  &mdash;  but guess what, we spent every penny from Granada buying the very thing they wanted us to obscure.&rsquo;<br>

			<blockquote>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s this sort of stupidity that gives political correctness a bad name.&rsquo;</blockquote>Wrong. That&rsquo;s rather like complaining that the unpleasant aspects of <i>criminality</i> give criminality a bad name, because it implies that there exists somewhere the oxymoronic concept of criminality with no bad aspects and a good name.
<p>That sort of stupidity is the <i>very essence</i> of political correctness. Without that sort of stupidity, you don&rsquo;t have political correctness, you have <i>common sense</i>.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t the British people just hold a national bonfire and throw in their history. That&rsquo;s where this is all going; obliterate everything western and British. When their past as been purged, maybe then they can end their guilt for being who and what they are. They better hurry. Their new overlords are becoming impatient.</p>

			<p>If I were to go to Saudi Arabia and announce publicly that I was &#8220;offended&#8221; by the presence of the Islamic Crescent &#8220;offends&#8221; me. What does everyone here at AmRen suppose would happen to me? </p>

<p>Right on, you have identified the most profound action that the British people can do to fully capitulate to their masters.</p>
<p>A big bon fire and throw in it everything British.</p>

			<p>This kind of anti-english activity was dealt with on 15th June 1215. There will be no overt islamic comment on this programme, just the usual apologists claiming muslims didn&rsquo;t notice and, in any case, simply don&rsquo;t care. It is still not made clear who decided to implement this anti-Christian act of desecration and we are not likely to find out.  Anyway, muslims are forbidden from watching TV as m&rsquo;d didn&rsquo;t have a set. Behind the scenes of all british T/V, there are dark, hooded, black masked forces at work, scanning everything and forbidding anything &#8216;offensive&rsquo; well in advance. Islam offends me, and that is a very polite English way of voicing my true feelings.  </p>

<p>&gt; You all know me, I am not particularly supportive of any religion, but this is ridiculous.  If the people choose to have a wedding in a Christian church, they were likely Christians.  Christians have the right to have their symbols as any.  If the TV crew really thought that a cross would be offensive in a land where the Royal head is head of the state church then maybe they should have not made the film at all.  A blackout at least is not this pathetic.</p>
