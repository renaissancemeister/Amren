<p>Few whites are aware of the nonsense that circulates about them among blacks. Ever since the days of the slave trade, when Africans were convinced that whites planned to eat them, to the present, when more than half of all blacks think that illegal drugs may be part of a genocidal plot, blacks have believed all sorts of foolishness about whites.</p>
<p>Patricia Turner, a black associate professor at the University of California at Davis, has looked into today&rsquo;s anti-white rumors and tries to explain why blacks  &mdash;  even successful, college-educated blacks  &mdash;  believe them. She says that they naturally expect the worst from whites because American society is so hopelessly racist that virtually any sort of white wickedness is plausible. Her book is therefore not just a study of credulity but also an exercise in it.</p>
<p><b>The Almighty Klan</b></p>
<p>One of the most persistent themes in the world of black rumors is the fearsome powers of the Ku Klux Klan. For example, during the 1980s and even up to the present, many blacks firmly believed that the Church&rsquo;s Fried Chicken fast food chain was owned by the Klan and that its food was doctored to sterilize black men. In 1984, a congressman actually had the FDA conduct mass spectrometry and gas chromatography tests on Church&rsquo;s chicken to see what was in it. Naturally, the FDA found nothing suspicious, but these results did not satisfy &#8220;the folk,&#8221; as Prof. Turner often calls blacks. Some of her informants explained that the Klan would have had no trouble persuading the FDA to lie about the tests.</p>
<p>Another recent Klan enterprise is said to have been the Troop Sport clothing company, which was founded in 1985 and sold 95 percent of its clothes to blacks and Hispanics. The Troop name reportedly stood for &#8220;To Rule Over Oppressed People,&#8221; and the linings of shoes and jackets were supposed to contain messages like &#8220;Thank you, nigger, for making us rich.&#8221; Some young blacks who wore Troop clothes despite the rumor and subsequent boycott were attacked as traitors by other blacks.</p>
<p>Troop spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to fight the rumor. It hired the black singing group Gladys Night and the Pips to improve its image and posted anti-Klan posters in stores. The campaign failed and Troop went bankrupt, though the company denied that the boycott was the cause.</p>
<p>Prof. Turner tells us that the most recent alleged Klan front has been the Brooklyn Bottling Company, which sells a soda called Tropical Fantasy. Like Church&rsquo;s chicken, the soda was said to be laced with a drug that would selectively sterilize black men. There is no odorless, tasteless substance that sterilizes anyone, much less only black men, but the FDA duly trotted out its mass spectrometers and cleared Tropical Fantasy. The rumor was unaffected and caused serious losses for Brooklyn Bottling. It also provoked violence; blacks attacked delivery trucks and roughed up storekeepers who stocked Tropical Fantasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The folk&#8221; credit the Klan with many achievements. It is said to have killed John Kennedy and to be deeply involved in the tobacco business. The eponymous founders of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are both said to have been important Klan members (despite the fact that Philip Morris was British), and Kool menthol cigarettes are suspect because of the brand&rsquo;s ominous misspelling.</p>
<p>The Klan is likewise thought to have killed Martin Luther King, though the government may have helped. As one informant said, &#8220;I heard it was the FBI or the KKK  &mdash;  one of those groups.&#8221; Prof. Turner notes that for many of &#8220;the folk,&#8221; there is no real difference between the two.</p>
<p><b>Genocidal Government</b></p>
<p>If the Klan has fearsome powers, those of the United States government are more fearsome still. As noted earlier, more than half of all blacks are either convinced that the government supplies illegal drugs to blacks or that it might well be doing so. Many blacks think it was Ronald Reagan who started spreading guns and crack cocaine in black neighborhoods out of a deep-seated hatred for blacks.</p>
<p>One reason many of Prof. Turner&rsquo;s informants give for believing that the government is spreading illegal drugs is their complete confidence in its ability to keep them out of the country. Since there are drugs in America it must mean that the government lets them in so that blacks will take them and kill each other.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was said to be behind the Atlanta child murders of the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that period 28 young blacks were killed before a black was finally convicted of the crimes. Even today, the conviction is commonly thought to have been a frame-up. The CDC employed the FBI to do the killings, because an essential ingredient for the manufacture of wonder drugs could be obtained only by extracting it from the sex organs of young blacks. The comedian Dick Gregory helped promote this rumor.</p>
<p>Many blacks, including the actor Bill Cosby, also believe that AIDS was invented by the government in order to kill blacks. Prof. Turner herself isn&rsquo;t quite sure what to believe. She finds it ominous that when government agencies deny that they invented the virus they argue that bio-engineering is too primitive for that. She hints darkly that this may mean that the government might just spread deadly diseases among blacks if only it knew how.</p>
<p>Suspicions about drugs and AIDS are so widespread and so ridiculous that they have broken into the news but there are always other rumors on the go among &#8220;the folk&#8221; that whites rarely hear.</p>
<p>The Reebok shoe company funnels its profits to South Africa to prop up apartheid. Whites adopt Latin American babies to kill them and harvest their organs for transplants. George Bush started the Gulf war because there are so many blacks in the military. Colonel Sanders stole his Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe from a black cook who worked for his parents. The offices of Planned Parenthood are located in black neighborhoods to keep blacks from reproducing. The police deliberately let the Los Angeles riots get out of hand so that blacks and Hispanics would look bad on television. Clothing designer Liz Claiborne said on the Oprah Winfrey television program that she didn&rsquo;t like to see black people wearing her clothes. Miss Claiborne has never been on that program, but many blacks threw out their Liz Claiborne dresses. Whites are always up to some kind of mischief.</p>
<p><b>Explanations</b></p>
<p>Why do blacks believe this nonsense? Whites usually look for a rational explanation. When a company is said to be trying to sterilize blacks, its officers suspect that a competitor is trying to do them down. When the government is accused of wanting to kill blacks, the CIA and the United States Information Agency go looking for Communist propaganda.</p>
<p>Prof. Turner is probably right to argue that this sort of thinking is a waste of time. &#8220;The folk&#8221; are sufficiently credulous and sufficiently ill-disposed towards whites to cook up and swallow rumors without any outside help. Prof. Turner does not quite put it this way. She says that whites have been and continue to be so implacably racist that any kind of anti-black evil is plausible even if scientifically impossible.</p>
<p>The first part of her book is therefore full of ancient Klan atrocities that are supposed to justify today&rsquo;s delusions, and the rest is sprinkled with the usual assumptions about contemporary white wickedness: random blacks are often beaten up while the police look the other way, television promotes anti-black stereotypes, the government is hostile to blacks, whites won&rsquo;t hire blacks, the police persecute blacks, etc. In Prof. Turner&rsquo;s world, affirmative action does not exist and it is always necessary to assume that whites are racists.</p>
<p>Her assumptions about sex take us deeper still into the world of black delusion. For example, we learn that the early Ku Klux Klan was primarily motivated by a sense of sexual inferiority coupled with latent homosexual desires for black men. Southern whites called blacks &#8220;boy&#8221; in unconscious acknowledgment of their Ganymead attractions, and lynched them because of this unbearable, suppressed homosexual lust. We also learn that Ku Kluxers stuffed wads of paper down their pants before they went calling on blacks so as not to appear insufficiently endowed.</p>
<p>Current anti-white rumors, Prof. Turner repeatedly points out, are filled with sexual elements: the KKK is trying to sterilize blacks, AIDS will exterminate blacks because it is sexually transmitted, white doctors need to extract something from black sex organs, etc. She stops just short of saying that all this is evidence of sexual obsessiveness <em>on the part of whites.</em></p>
<p>Prof. Turner cannot bring herself to admit that black beliefs are aberrant or deplorable. Though she concedes that they may be tough on innocent companies that are smeared, she thinks goofy rumors are <em>good</em> for blacks. Believe it or not, rumors are &#8220;tools of resistance&#8221; because the catharsis of naming oppressors  &mdash;  such as the Klan and the FBI  &mdash;  gives blacks &#8220;a sense of power&#8221; and &#8220;contributes to an atmosphere of communal problem-solving.&#8221; &#8220;Sharing the rumor and joining the boycott,&#8221; says Prof. Turner, &#8220;enables individuals to perceive themselves as powerful.&#8221; What must Prof. Turner think of blacks if she really believes that swallowing preposterous nonsense &#8220;contributes to an atmosphere of communal problem-solving&#8221;?</p>
<p>The truth about these rumors is more stark and unpleasant than Prof. Turner seems to think. If today&rsquo;s blacks think their government is trying to kill them or that the KKK can tell the FDA what to put into a report, they will believe anything. Of course, foreign correspondents in Africa stagger back to civilization with reports more amazing than these: sorcerers who can steal a man&rsquo;s genitals with a handshake, religious fanatics who believe they can walk on water  &mdash;  and then drown en masse, witches who call down lightning and must be burned to death. Africans are champions of credulity, ripe for rumor, superstition, and nonsense.</p>
<p>Another element in these rumors that escapes Prof. Turner&rsquo;s notice is the implied omnipotence of the white man. Whites <em>could</em> stop illegal drugs if they wanted, or invent viruses, or sterilize black men, or prevent riots, or just about anything else. &#8220;The folk,&#8221; on the other hand, are dolts who, with a little coaxing, can be made to buy shoes, eat fried chicken, take drugs, shoot each other, and get AIDS. This is powerful commentary on how blacks really see themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, a message that whites ignore at their peril is the implication of what <em>blacks</em> would want to do to a minority in their midst. Do not their delusions of genocide reflect their own desires and fantasies? Whether it be Idi Amin&rsquo;s massacres or South African necklacings or corpses by the truckload in Burundi, Africans often make short and bloody work of their tribal enemies.</p>
<p>Much as she tries to blame &#8220;the folk&rsquo;s&#8221; fantastic beliefs on white racism, Prof. Turner unwittingly points to the depths from which they flow.</p>

			<p>Well, the government wishes for all races to mix together, as does the media.  This is genocide against whites and somewhat to the Africans, so I can agree with them to a degree, but for different reasons.  If we were all mixed, then it would destroy all the races, but every time blacks get white DNA, they benefit and we lose.  This is probably why they don&rsquo;t view integration as genocide but look for other &#8220;explanations&#8221; for genocide.</p>

			<p>I was listining to a live broadcast of Professor Griff, Minister of Propadganda for Public Enemy,one day on KALX, the radio station of UC Berkeley.He said, seriously, that the Gub-ment had built a bomb that will kill a black man, but it would not kill a white man.Nothing that they say will shock me anymore.</p>

			<p>I experience this delusion daily at work. A black man thinks that any time he  cannot keep up with the conversation or says something ridiculous and is logically challenged that it is because of racism. At first I tried reasoning wiht him but he became aggressive, then I tried ignoring him but that was also racist&hellip;now I just give him shallow engagements in order to pacify him so he will shut up and leave me alone. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Why do blacks believe this nonsense? Whites usually look for a rational explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks as a group not only have low intelligence, which contributes mostly to their acceptance of such nonsense, but they also are beset with an inability to reason and logic in coherent terms.   </p>
<p>And, added to this inability is perhaps the possibility that their paranoia is a trait they still have for survival purposes, because they haven&rsquo;t evolved as far as the rest of humanity. Being naturally paranoid is a necessary condition in order to guard against those things in a primitive, wilderness, jungle society that would harm or destroy them.  In other words, in a dangerous world it&rsquo;s necessary to suspect everything in order to survive.</p>
<p>Both reasons would explain why &#8220;educated&#8221; blacks also buy into these delusional beliefs, plus &#8220;educated&#8221; blacks for the most part are not really educated, but are beneficiaries of affirmative action degrees and grading, which many academics have inadvertently admitted on several occassions, so they&rsquo;re not really on much of a higher level than the average black with an I.Q. of 85.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says that whites have been and continue to be so implacably racist that any kind of anti-black evil is plausible even if scientifically impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evil, unreasoning hatred brimming over in this black piece is typical of black anti-white hatred that is nourished and encouraged by most within all black communities nation-wide.  But mostly it is a grim reminder that blacks have no place in an advanced civilization, and will never be able to contribute anything useful to white society and will forever be the dregs of white countries throughout the Western world.</p>
<p>China is wise to bar them from certain establishments.  I&rsquo;m certain they&rsquo;ve noticed how far down they have brought the United States, and are determined not to let it occur in their country.</p>
<p>Higher ups in Japan have commented that the US will never be able to compete in the world of tomorrow, because of its large population of blacks.  I&rsquo;m sure the communists in China share this sentiment, but would not say so, because their ideology advocates the equality of all people.  But they know as well.</p>

			<p>It really is quite simple why blacks think these things of whites.  They are projecting.  They themselves hold incredible racist hate towards whites, for little more reason than they aren&rsquo;t severely punished for doing so.  And most blacks are near sociopaths&hellip;.capable of incredible acts of evil, with little or not remorse or even thought about it.  They think everyone is like that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whites are the exact opposite.  Very, very, VERY few whites hold any true darkness in their hearts.  Most think EVERYONE is like that.  Not only couldn&rsquo;t they be more wrong but it blinds them to the warning signs.  MANY whites are victimized by EVIL minorities, especially blacks, because the common heinous evil of your average black is simply too alien to them for them to comprehend.</p>

			<p>The Church&rsquo;s fried chicken rumour is hilarious.The Church&rsquo;s Fried Chicken brand name is owned by a man named Henry Lewis, who coincidentally is black. He has tried to promote black franchise ownership. The majority of the CFC stores are owned by blacks so when the &#8220;folk&#8221; boycott a CFC store they are boycotting their own.</p>

			<p>In all fairness to Whites (and others), blacks clearly lead the pack in believing in nonsense.  There&rsquo;s no mystery behind this, either.  As has been shown countless times on this website, 1/2 of American Whites have IQs over 100 compared to only 1/6 of blacks.  Stupid people believe in stupid things.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Another element in these rumors that escapes Prof. Turner&rsquo;s notice is the implied omnipotence of the white man. Whites could stop illegal drugs if they wanted, or invent viruses, or sterilize black men, or prevent riots, or just about anything else. &ldquo;The folk,&rdquo; on the other hand, are dolts who, with a little coaxing, can be made to buy shoes, eat fried chicken, take drugs, shoot each other, and get AIDS. This is powerful commentary on how blacks really see themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been saying for years that blacks, at least on a subconscious level, KNOW they are inferior to us.  Tney&rsquo;re stupid, but they&rsquo;re not THAT stupid!  Now if only there was some way to coax all those crypto-racialist Whites I know are out there to &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; and be heard.</p>

<p>The phenomenon you describe is called &#8220;transferrance.&#8221;  You tend to see in other people the qualities you have in yourself, for better or worse.  That many blacks harbor all these diabolical theories about whites demonstrates that they have the capability to do these things to whites if they were in charge.  Zim and ZA prove it.</p>

			<p>They believe that illegal drugs are a White plot to kill blacks,, they believe AIDS was invented by Whites to kill blacks,,</p>
<p> Alright let&rsquo;s take that at face value. If they &#8220;know&#8221; illegal drugs are a White trap aginst them, then why take them and fall for &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s trap&#8221;? </p>
<p> Why engage in unprotected promiscuous sexual activity and let Whites &#8220;get them&#8221; with AIDS? Again why fall for &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s trap&#8221;?</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s ONE THING if you don&rsquo;t know about it, but if you do know and fall for the bait anyways AFTER KNOWING its a trap what does that say about you and your intelligence. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a troop of soldiers walking blindly into an ambush. Now imagine this same troop of soldiers KNOWS IN ADVANCE where and when the ambush is going to happen &hellip; and then still walking blindly into the ambush.. Unreal.</p>

			<p>Months ago, American Renaissance had a story that - despite lower average scores than others - black American students believed themselves to be &#8220;more intelligent&#8221;/had higer faith in their academic ability than what their scores showed them.<br/>
When you factor in the egotistic tendencies of blacks, it&rsquo;s easy to see where these bizarre conspiracies come from:<br/>
* Black Americans have equal/greater intelligence than white Americans.<br/>
* However blacks have disproportionately large crime/drug addiction/poverty rates compared to their<br/>
percentage of the U.S. population and compared to whites.<br/>
* Whites have &#8220;oppressed&#8221; blacks in the past, and most of the wealthy of America are white.<br/>
* Therefore, there &#8220;must&#8221; be a conspiracy by whites to increase black American crime/drug addiction/poverty rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Random blacks are often beaten up while the police look the other way, television promotes anti-black stereotypes, the government is hostile to blacks, whites won&rsquo;t hire blacks, the police persecute blacks, etc.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the few &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; I&rsquo;ve spoken to, nearly all had one or more anecdotes about &#8220;driving while black&#8221; etc:<br/>
Totally non-verifiable of course, but they wouldn&rsquo;t <b>lie</b>, would they?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>She stops just short of saying that all this is evidence of sexual obsessiveness on the part of whites.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The most bizarre rumour of this type I heard was that &#8220;white Freemasons consumed black genitalia to gain magic powers&#8221;:<br/>
But seriously, visit any &#8216;black&rsquo; forum and you&rsquo;ll find that most of the posters believe that white males are just closeted pedophiles/homosexuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What must Prof. Turner think of blacks if she really believes that swallowing preposterous nonsense &ldquo;contributes to an atmosphere of communal problem-solving&rdquo;</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember Amren readers that <b>these rumours have an eery resemblance to those told about Jews and &#8220;witches&#8221; in medieval Europe</b>:<br/>
Any European Christian authority could whip up a story about Jews or &#8220;witches&#8221; poisoning wells, stealing and sacrificing children to demons, destroying crops etc - which lead to the numerous incidents of Christian peasants/lower classes rampaging through Jewish ghettoes, and the infamous &#8220;witch-hunts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, can you imagine what effect telling black Americans that whites are making them &#8220;sexually impotent&#8221;/&#8221;addicted to crack&#8221;/&#8221;kill each other&#8221; is going to make them think of Europeans?<br/>
Remember that the distant relatives of these black Americans are chopping up albinos to form magic charms, raping virgins to cure themselves of HIV/AIDS and hiring witchdoctors under their respective &#8220;Ministries of Health&#8221; - is it much of a stretch to imagine said black Americans attacking their white neighbours because D&rsquo;trell Williams said that whites were kidnapping black children as sex slaves?</p>

			<p>I wonder if blacks are just better at sticking up for their own?</p>
<p>I heard one on daytime television. One of those talk shows like Sally Jesse. A guest claimed the word Nike from Nike shoes stood for &#8220;N&rsquo;ers is killin each other&#8221;. I think the whole episode of the show was devoted to that. Pretty lame one I know but I&rsquo;ve never been able to get it out of my head.</p>

<p>Did anyone on that show or calling in inform them that Nike is a Greek word that means &#8220;victory?&#8221;  I live across the river from Portland and have know a few people who work for NIKE.  But this is really no different from the &#8220;White Devils snatched us out of our huts in Africa&#8221; claims.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s ridiculous about these rumors is both how powerful and impotent they make whites look at the same time. If whites really wanted to reduce blacks&rsquo; numbers, they could do so very easily, by simply putting black criminals in jail on their first offense, for example, before they had a chance to impregnate more black women, or by refusing to subsidize illegitimacy with increased welfare, etc. Instead, whites do silly things like trying to drug fried chicken!</p>
<p>According to the rumors, whites desperately want to put down blacks but prove themselves pitifully inept at doing so. Maybe there&rsquo;s something to Prof. Turner&rsquo;s claim that the rumor mongering &ldquo;enables [black] individuals to perceive themselves as powerful.&rdquo; And, I might add, it enables blacks to perceive whites as incredibly clumsy. </p>

			<p>I think we need to concentrate on the rich,bored,whites that champion these sort of things.They generally live in gated communities and have a lot of time on their hands,and need a cause to fight for.The only safe seems to be against their own race and civilization,yet this is what brought them there wealth and comforts.They go down to the slums to particapate in the &#8220;struggles&#8221;of the oppressed and go back to their affluent homes before dark(or pay for protection to stay the night).Of course they speak against their own race,and profusely apoligize for being white.Why is it that something in white people make them do these sort of things.It seems like the image of being heroic and noble overides the ability to reason.The media(who are made up of the aforementioned)reinforces this everyday on television and radio.The third worlders naturally take advantage of their stupidity and naivity,and have nothing but contempt for them.When you really think about it,how could they not.I know that I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Exactly right. The same government that makes the very lives of most blacks possible in the first place (via the various organs of the welfare state) is alleged, by blacks, to be conspiring against them in the most absurd ways. Why not just eliminate food stamps, WIC, TANF, Section 8, Medicaid, SSI, &#8220;affirmative action,&#8221; and all the Subsidized Everything? That would be far more effective than tampering with KFC or grape soda.</p>

			<p><i>The offices of Planned Parenthood are located in black neighborhoods to keep blacks from reproducing.</i></p>
<p>Amusingly enough, there is actually a grain of truth to this one. </p>
<p>Margaret Sanger, who founded Planned Parenthood (originally called the American Birth Control League) was an avid supporter of eugenics and &#8220;race hygiene&#8221;. She believed that selective breeding, sterilization and even euthanasia were necessary to weed out &#8220;genetically unfit&#8221; peoples and thereby raise the overall intelligence of society.</p>
<p>It really might not be an accident that the first Planned Parenthood clinics showed up in black neighborhoods.</p>
