<h1>Blacks and Latinos Make Up About 80% Stopped and Questioned by NYPD, Study Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Boyle and Tina Moore, New York Daily News, January 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NYPD is on pace to stop and question a record half a million citizens this year  &mdash;  about 80% of them black or Latino, a new report says.</p>
<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights, citing NYPD data obtained in a suit, said the vast majority of those stopped and questioned in 2005 through June 2008 weren&rsquo;t charged with any crime.</p>
<p>In 2007, for instance, the last complete year of data, cops arrested only 5.8% of the 472,096 people they stopped (27,632).</p>
<p>&#8220;The New York City Police Department continues to prey on African-American and Latino communities in New York City,&#8221; Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commissioner Paul Browne, the NYPD&rsquo;s chief spokesman, said the number of minorities who were singled out under the policy is consistent with overall descriptions by race provided by victims and surviving witnesses of crime.</p>
<p>He pointed to a RAND Corp. study that found no racial profiling in its examination, &#8220;and warned against the kind of simplistic comparisons made by the center.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their assertions do not constitute a study of the data, but a restatement of accusations in its lawsuit,&#8221; he added.</p>

			<p>Of course a very high percentage of people stopped by the NYPD weren&rsquo;t charged with any crime.  That&rsquo;s true overall, most traffic stops only generate an infraction-level violation.  It&rsquo;s only if you do something really bad in the process of your driving, or you have a warrant, that you&rsquo;re charged with a crime.</p>

<p>And yet whites who commit crimes are much more likely to be caught than their black and hispanic counterparts, who are more likely to literally get away with murder. I wonder why that isn&rsquo;t the headline? Or even in the story at all. Doesn&rsquo;t fit the profile?</p>

			<p>I have lived in the area of the NYC suburbs all my life. Day in - day out, I have watched the newscasts from NYC for nearly forty years. The story is ALWAYS the same! Since I was old enough to comprehend what the news was and/or recall any of it, I have watched Blacks and more recently Hispanics featured front and center, often as both victim and perpetrator of violent crime&hellip;or most any crime! Literally, night after night, it is murder, robbery, rape, stabbings, drug busts, or whatever general thuggery one can conjure&hellip;and the faces are ALWAYS black and brown! <br>
Virtually every night, murder heads up the reporting, and invariably the suspects are the same. There is no hyperbole in what I write here - it is literally the same every day. </p>
<p>So my question is&hellip;only 80% of those stopped are Black and Hispanic?? Sounds like the cops could do more!! </p>

<p>Well, if it were up to me, Vince old boy, I wouldn&rsquo;t allow even one single stop and advise my cops to spend their eight hours at Dunkin Doughnuts.  Then I&rsquo;d put a bug in anybody&rsquo;s ear that would listen that your neighborhood is known for &#8220;easy pickens&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t call us if somebody has you by the throat.  We&rsquo;ll call you.</p>

			<p>This story is featured in one of the main tabloids that many NY area residents read. The NY Post would be the other major daily (and NY Newsday with a more limited distribution). My Afro colleagues despise the Post as it is somewhat conservative of the neo variety and will have op eds by Thomas Sowell and others whose opinion does not support the black rage/white guilt hypothesis. </p>
<p>The wording in this article is very biased just in its presentation, that is it is made to stoke the fires of rage in blacks and latinos.</p>
<p>Of course when a story such as this is published:<br>
https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/01/13/2009-01-13_three_stabbed_woman_clinging_to_life_aft.html</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no mention that it is a black attack on (one of the last remaining) whites in Queens. <br>
https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/01/15/2009-01-15_elderly_pair_each_shielded_other_in_loon.html</p>
<p>Finally the fact that there is an organization like the Center for Constitutional Rights ready to foster anti-white sentiments bears witness to the fact we have a long uphill battle to save whatever is worth saving in this society. The CCR is an organization began by a true skunk known throughout the NY area, William Kuntsler:<br>

			<p>Something else that is left out is that whites in NYC now ARE THE MINORITY. So besides the whole common knowledge that whites commit far less crimes is the fact that there just are not that many whites left in NYC. Walk down 34th street on any given afternoon and you would swear you were in some country in Africa, South America or Asia.</p>

			<p>In my neighborhood where I serve on a neighborhood watch committee and am involved in crime prevention work, I hear about each street crime committed in my area.  It is very rare to hear of a &#8220;street crime&#8221; (drug dealing, robbery, mugging, assault, carjacking, home invasion robberies) where the suspect or perpetrator is not black or sometimes Hispanic.  In fact in 3 years of looking at all listings of such crimes, I can&rsquo;t think of a single one where the suspect was not black except for 2 I heard of involving Hispanics.  AMong property crimes, such as burglary or vandalism, there is less homogeneity among perps.  I read of a white woman suspected in connection with some burglaries in the Berkeley/Oakland hills. In the North Bay police shot and killed another white woman who fled from police after they sought her in connection with a burlgary.  So there are more of other races perhaps involved with such crimes and non-street crimes.  But within the category of street crimes it seems to be about 99% blacks involved, from my anecdotal evidence of my neighborhood listings.  </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;If most suspects weren&rsquo;t black or Hispanic, police wouldn&rsquo;t be stopping blacks and Hispanics</p>
<p>And the simple-minded liberals&rsquo; rebuttal would go thusly: &#8220;Poverty causes crime.&#8221; Of course to actually BELIEVE this, you&rsquo;d have to disregard reality!</p>

			<p>Black and Hispanic cops are no doubt involved in these stops and are just as hard on their own and each other&rsquo;s group as whites are.</p>
