<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/28/AR2009012803487.html">Barry Again Fails to File Tax Forms</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Del Quentin Wilber and Nikita Stewart, Washington Post, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The former District mayor has not submitted federal or city tax forms for 2007  &mdash;  the second instance in which he has not filed required returns while on probation for tax offenses, said two sources familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Two years ago, federal prosecutors failed to convince a federal judge that Barry should be jailed for violating the terms of his probation, which was ordered in 2006, because he did not file 2005 tax returns. The probation expires in March.</p>
<p>Barry declined last night to discuss the matter or say when he might file his taxes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sources said they did not know whether Barry owed taxes in 2007. The D.C. government withholds a portion of his $92,530 salary, and Barry might be owed a refund, the sources said. He filed his 2006 returns, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss tax matters.</p>
<p>Barry&rsquo;s current trouble stems from a guilty plea in 2005 to two misdemeanor tax charges. He admitted not filing federal or D.C. tax returns from 1999 through 2004 and said that he did not pay most of the taxes he owed on more than $500,000 in income. U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson sentenced him to three years of probation in March 2006.</p>
<p>In less than a year, federal prosecutors returned to court and asked Robinson to revoke Barry&rsquo;s probation and send him to jail because he had failed to file 2005 returns. Prosecutors said at the time that the judge should send Barry to jail to make &#8220;clear to this defendant that he is not above the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barry, who has served as a D.C. Council member since 2005, did not list any additional income on his most recent financial disclosure form.</p>
<p>According to campaign finance records, he has not listed extra income on such forms since 2005, when he acknowledged earning in excess of $1,000 from M.R. Beal &amp; Co., a minority-owned investment firm that specializes in corporate and municipal finance.<br>

He breaks probation and he doesn&rsquo;t get any punishment; the black judge is just trying to be wise. </p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t a big deal. The majority of our country voted for a person who put a person who recently broke the law by not paying taxes in charge of our treasury. There really isn&rsquo;t anything in the treasury, so I suppose that isn&rsquo;t a big deal either.</p>

			<p>This is the same man that said all laws are racist, even the law of gravity is racist.</p>
<p>After learning that bit of wisdom that passed across his lips does anybody wonder how such a person would have enough sense to make sure he was in compliance?  I mean, to keep from getting into a bind with the government if nothing else.</p>

			<p>The judge allowed him to remain on probation, for his failure to pay taxes for 1999-2004, because his failure to file taxes in 2005 wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;willful.&rdquo; <br>
I had to google a photo of Judge Robinson and surprise, she&rsquo;s black.<br>
The search also turned up an article on her dreadlocked son. He was arrested for being an armed heroin dealer. Could get 40 years.<br>

			<p>Apparently the Judge Robinson felt compassion for Mr Barry, she didn&rsquo;t want him in the joint with her son. It never seems to fail that these supposedly successful blacks raise children that act like the inner city types.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
U.S. District Court magistrate judge Deborah A. Robinson normally presides over matters in her Washington, D.C., courtroom. But on Dec. 3 she sat in the gallery of a federal courtroom in Baltimore to witness her 21-year-old son, Philip Winkfield, admit to being an armed heroin dealer.</p>
<p>Winkfield was a Morgan State University student last April, living in Dutch Village in Northeast Baltimore, when a raid team served a warrant at his apartment and found him with five loaded guns (including an assault rifle), a bullet-proof vest, a digital scale, a drug ledger, cutting agent, and a bunch of heroin, cocaine, and pot.</p>
<p>Despite the broad array of evidence, on Wednesday Winkfield copped only to dealing heroin and to the fact &#8220;that one or more of the firearms was used in furtherance of the crime,&#8221; according to the plea agreement. &#8220;This is not a cooperation agreement,&#8221; said U.S. District Court judge J. Frederick Motz after accepting Winkfield&rsquo;s plea deal, which had been hammered out by prosecutor George Jarrod Hazel and Winkfield&rsquo;s attorneys, Gregg Bernstein and Robert Mance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Mr. Winkfield&rsquo;s family?&#8221; Motz asked near the end of the hearing, referring to Judge Robinson and Winkfield&rsquo;s father, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs attorney John C. Winkfield. They nodded, and Motz proceeded to tell the defendant that &#8220;this has got to be a bad day for you and a bad day for them,&#8221; but &#8220;your life isn&rsquo;t over, make this the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case against Winkfield began with state charges filed last spring, but was bumped up to the federal level in early November. Winkfield, who has been held without bail since his arrest last spring, will remain detained until his sentencing hearing, scheduled for Jan. 23, 2009. He faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison, up to a maximum of 40 years.</p>

			<p>NYC&rsquo;s first black mayor David Dinkins &#8220;forgot&#8221; to pay his taxes for four straight years. Not to mention actors Wesley Snipes and Redd Foxx.</p>
<p>Foxx used to tell people he&rsquo;d only pay taxes if the president was black. Had he lived I guess he&rsquo;d be a McCain supporter&hellip; </p>

			<p>If my memory serves me correctly, I recall 15 or so years ago when Jesse Jackson was urging DC residents not to file taxes because of the &#8220;statehood&#8221; issue. I also seem to recall that this was an exercise in futility since 80% of DC residents were eligible for EITC.</p>

<p>Yes, but as Dave was kind enough to explain, he didn&rsquo;t commit a crime; what he did was &#8220;&hellip;fail to comply with the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Add Shapton to the list:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Sharpton said he saw no reason why blacks should pay taxes. &#8216;If we do not have a justice system that protects us, what are we paying for?&rsquo; Sharpton has faced multiple charges &mdash; and one conviction &mdash; of tax evasion&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
