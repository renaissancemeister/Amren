<h1>Student Decapitated at Virginia Tech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A graduate student from China was decapitated with a kitchen knife in a campus cafe at Virginia Tech by another graduate student who knew her, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>Xin Yang, 22, was killed Wednesday night after arriving at the campus from Beijing on Jan. 8 to begin studying accounting, Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum said.</p>
<p>Her accused attacker, 25-year-old Haiyang Zhu of Ningbo, China, knew the victim but no motive for the slaying has been determined, Chief Flinchum said. School records showed that Mr. Haiyang was listed as one of Ms. Xin&rsquo;s emergency contacts.</p>
<p>Mr. Haiyang was charged with first-degree murder and was being held without bond at the Montgomery County Jail. His lawyer, Stephanie Cox, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Haiyang and Ms. Xin had been having coffee in a cafe in the Graduate Life Center, where Ms. Xin was living. About seven other people who were in the coffee shop told police that the two hadn&rsquo;t been arguing before the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stabbing was the first killing on campus since a mass killing on campus in 2007, when a student gunman shot 32 people and then took his own life.</p>
<p>&#8220;An act of violence like this brings back memories of April 16,&#8221; university president Charles Steger said. &#8220;I have no doubt that many of us feel especially distraught.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Chief Flinchum said Mr. Haiyang was not known to the campus police or to the university team that deals with mentally disturbed students.&#8221;</p>
<p>They now have a university team that deals with mentally disturbed students?</p>

			<p>Sounds like this killing stems from whatever their relationship was in China.  Expect to see liberals call for banning kitchen knives as the British liberals are doing.</p>
<p>If the Brits banned immigration instead of guns and knives their murder rate would be very low.  Instead, they are importing murderous immigrants.</p>

			<p>Has anyone noticed that over the last decade (actually more), most of the on campus rampage murders have been committed by those supposedly non-dangerous Asian males? Maybe studying 4 - 5 hours a day after school isn&rsquo;t all that healthy. </p>

			<p>I remember at the University of Washington in Seattle, back in 2000 a Chinese med student killed his white professor.  Also, in &#8216;91 a Chinese grad student at U.Iowa killed his white professor and a bunch of white students because he didn&rsquo;t get some prestigious scholarship.</p>
<p>Of course if the races were flipped there would be a giant memorials for the victims and a yearly symposium on anti-Asian racism to commemorate these events at U.Washington and U.Iowa.  </p>

			<p> Life is cheap in Asia . Were it not for contact with the West and in this case  I would include the former Soviet Union as part of the West, much of Asia would still be mired in a Medieval existence, so would the Middle East .Sub-Saharan Africa ? How about prehistoric &hellip;?</p>

Yes, and I&rsquo;ve heard absolutely nothing about it since.</p>

			<p>I am absolutely horrified by the brutal act of actually beheading someone in this way.  This is completely alien to my sensibility.  I can&rsquo;t imagine any white person killing another in a cafe in a similar manner.  More diversity to celebrate?</p>

<p>How could you refer to us Brits as &#8220;Brits&#8221;. Good God, how racist. You are as bad as Prince Harry (&#8220;our Paki friend&#8221; etc)</p>

			<p>It would be darkly funny to see a warning about dangerous Asian males on the Virginia Tech Campus.  </p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve been out of Tech since about two years before Cho killed 32 people and wounded about 27 others, but still visit the campus once in a while as it is right next to the rather partyish downtown Blacksburg.)</p>
<p>Ahh, but it would be racist to suggest that Asian males might have pathologies which lead them to be violent.  </p>
<p>However, Virginia Tech enshrines the demonization of White males as the sustainers of racism / all the evil in the world.  What happens when Blacks or Asians commit murder in the area you may wonder?  Why the same demonizers of Whites excuse the acts as at worst, the actions of a lone nut which in no way reflect the attitudes of other non-Whites and call for tolerance and forgiveness.  Some, like Nikki Geovanni who taught Cho and kicked him out of her class for being too mean, blame White culture for making monsters out of non-Whites.  </p>
<p>Again the papers are taking the lone nut angle.  I wonder what Nikki Geovanni would say about this incident if she were off her guard.  As usual, there will be no condemnation of any racial culture other than White.</p>
<p>The anti-White double standard is alive an well here in Montgomery County, Virginia.  Created by the mainstream mass media and sustained by our tax dollars.</p>

			<p>The man murdered on the Greyhound in Canada was Tim McLean.  Keep looking him up on the &#8216;net.  The trial is in 2009.  Tim McLean did NOTHING wrong.  He was by all accounts a peaceful man.  He texted an old girlfriend and settled back to sleep shortly before he was murdered.  My heart goes out to her, and to his family.  R.I.P Tim, we who miss riding Greyhound will not forget you.</p>

			<p>You AmRen-ers are so harsh toward other cultures.  Don&rsquo;t you see that we must appreciate the diversity of alternative lifestyles?  Beheading is just a different way of expressing one&rsquo;s relational milieu.  These foreign students at VTech are in a sense no less than multiculturalist performance artists.</p>

			<p>The Saturday, Jan. 24th edition of the Roanoke Times reportes that Zhu lived with two roommates who (as of Saturday) have not been seen since the murder.  Police are also not willing yet to release details on Zhu&rsquo;s motive.</p>
<p>I wonder if his roommates are just in hiding or perhaps have been killed by Zhu and the powers that be are afraid to come out with a story about another Asian multiple murderer at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it is odd that there is no suggestion of a motive by the media.</p>

			<p>This happened at Simon&rsquo;s Rock College in Great Barrington, Mass. in 1992, except that the student, Wayne Lo, went on a shooting rampage.  I just discovered that he was on a minority scholarship to the school.  He killed one student and one faculty member.  Here&rsquo;s the link&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks for the post and link.</p>
<p>In fact, here is an excerpt from the link.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although many statements were made prior to the trial regarding Lo&rsquo;s bigoted and racist views, he was never charged with a hate crime and the racism accusations were never substantiated during the month-long trial. Instead, the focus turned to his mental state at the time of the shootings as Lo&rsquo;s defense lawyers entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>This would never have happened if he were White.  That it didn&rsquo;t happen is proof enough for me that this situation was handled by the PC Police for its own benefit.  </p>
<p>And the correspondence between Lo and the Father of one of his victims is symptomatic of the cultural climate created by Political Correctness, itself managed by a very hostile, and hypocritcal, elite.<br/>

			<p>Dedalus,</p>
<p>I too noticed that he was not charged with a hate crime  &mdash;  -this is one of many examples of where someone has not been charged with a hate crime due to &#8220;mental health issues&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  yet in all of these cases, the perp seems to be non-European American.  It&rsquo;s very frustrating.  Simon&rsquo;s Rock College is an unusual college  &mdash;  basically a school for bizarre rich kids (and non-European Americans on minority scholarships too, apparently) who can&rsquo;t get into a regular college or university.</p>

<p>You are right about this because hate crime laws were intended soly to prosecute white people who defend themselves and their people.  Why do people stand idly by while a white person is beaten by blacks?  Many reasons, but they&rsquo;re probably afraid of being charged with a hate crime for fighting with a black.  Heck, even if you defend yourself from a non white and say a racial slur or have something about you that suggests you are racially aware, you will be charged with a crime.</p>
<p>Does anybody remember the incident with the White Creativity movement?  One of their members shot a black man who was about to throw a brick at him in a parking lot.  The prosecution actually claimed they had &#8220;evidence&#8221; that the attacker dropped the brick and surrendered before being shot.  They even used the black man&rsquo;s status as a Gulf War vet as propaganda.  The said Creativity member isn&rsquo;t going to get out of prison for another 10-15 years.</p>
<p>We have to recognize that this is not just a conflict against an anti white system that can be mended by voting or campaigning.  This is a conflict against an anti white system that has stacked the deck against us and WISHES our destruction at the hands of non whites, whether through race mixing or murder.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s enough to boggle the mind&hellip; Those incessantly spouted LIES that America NEEDS immigrants. While reality shows us that the diametric oppositeis the truth! That America would be many times better off WITH a 30-year moratorium on ALL immigration!</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;d be many times better off&hellip; without the crimes committed by immigrants.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;d be many times better off&hellip; without so many Amrican jobs lost to cheaper-working immigrants (who get those hand-outs, educational and support grants and benefits, courtesy of the unwilling American taxpayer!</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;d be many times better off&hellip; without the need for two, even three national languages, given the propsensity of Latino immigrants being to dull-mined, too lazy, too unwilling to learn OUR language when they sneak in thru our back door (the Mexican border).</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;d be many times better off&hellip; without these third-world primitives bringing their culture, their mindset, or the social problems and upheavals their presence in our country causes.</p>
<p>Name ONE White nation, if you can, that has NOT allowed immigration by African Blacks, by Caribbean Blacks, by Latino immigrants&hellip; that has actually benefitted from immigration! I eagerly await any reader to respond to my little challenge and prove me wrong. (Hint: You can&rsquo;t prove me wrong on my statement. Every European nation has suffered an increase in crime in allowing life-long welfare parasites into their nation.)</p>

<p>To Anyonymous and others who feel the same way.</p>
<p>Get used to it, lose your &#8220;this can&rsquo;t happen in America&#8221; mindset. It can and does happen in America.  And note that our people used to be able to handle this type of violence and when necessary give it back and we had better learn to do so again.</p>
<p>Vlad The Impaler - Count Dracula in Romania, is a folk hero to his Romanian people to  this day because he was willing to do on to the Muslim Turks, what the Muslim Turks did on to his/our people.</p>
<p>Henry the VIII of England - on balance a good king, didn&rsquo;t put up with lippy women wives and more than a few got their heads cut off. Good.</p>
<p>And if you react in horror at the thought of supporting such acts now, please remember the USA dropped a nuclear bomb on Japanese cities aat the end of WWII, that&rsquo;s a far worse atrocity that beheading someone.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t most of us love to see supposedly &#8220;Conservative, patriotic Americans who push open borders immigration like Jack Kemp, McCain, most neo Conservatives - wouldn&rsquo;t must of us enjoy seeing some large White guy with a big hood over his head staring down at the prone body of some of these traitors, while we in the crowd ask the soon to be headless idiot/traitors if they now have any regrets about  welcoming the 9/11 Al Qaeda terrorists into American on unsupervised student visas?</p>

			<p>Everyone is making such a big deal of this(and it is)but let&rsquo;s not forget about a student that was decapitated in Russia and the perpetrators were White Skinheads.  People shouldn&rsquo;t generalize. When a White person does that heinous of a crime, it gets swept under the rug, if an immigrant does it, Whites stand there with their jaws dropped and are in disbelief that how something like this can happen. This is hyprocracy at it&rsquo;s worst!</p>

Amazing!  Given the circumstances, you would think there would be great concern on the part of the authorities as to finding those other two.     Instead, they&rsquo;re hushing it up!</p>
<p>If the killer had been white, there would be all sorts of lurid speculations about what other possible crimes he might have been involved in.    Sickening.</p>

That&rsquo;s so true.  Most whites (who aren&rsquo;t racially savvy) cannot see the forest for the trees.  They just see each individual incident  for itself, but they do not see them all as a whole.  They are so brainwashed, they do not recognize the overall picture.   (And if they do, they afraid of being called  &#8220;racist&#8221;.)</p>

			<p>Had this fellow been from Sweden, or other mostly White country, none of you would be calling for a ban on Swedes, or even speaking in generalities drawn to all Swedes from the act of an individual.</p>
<p>Cho is Korean, mostly raised here in the United States. Zhu is Chinese and a recent arrival. While there is some racial overlap between Korea and China, most South Koreans are more similar to Japanese than Chinese.</p>
<p>With a Billion people, China is bound to have its share of violent people, just as we do here. It just isn&rsquo;t good logic to make generalizations where you attempt to argue from the specific to the general. For example, if you saw a man hit by lightening, it would be illogical to then conclude that every time lightening strikes, a man is hit. It is unfortunate that some, rather ignorant people, govern themselves using these sorts of fallacies to wit: someone was robbed in a park, so the illogical person never goes to that park again, or someone is bitten by a Shark, so the illogical people never go swimming again. </p>
<p>With the post 911 hysteria, millions of Americans have been living rather xenophobic lives, afraid of travel and stupidly avoiding friendly relations with those who are unfamiliar or who come from other countries. The sooner this sort of bunker-behavior stops, the more prosperous America shall become. </p>
<p>One useful angle to these murder stories, is to use them to advocate for lifting gun bans on campuses. Both the Cho and Zhu murders might have been stopped had there been a citizen nearby who was armed and trained to use a firearm for personal defense.</p>
<p>I have prevented several crimes against others and myself, simply by indicating to the potential perpetrator that I was armed and prepared to use my pistol. Everyone doesn&rsquo;t need to carry a weapon, but having the potential for an armed response by someone amid the potential pool of victims, is enough for most criminals to reconsider their plans.  </p>

			<p>A good bet is that this was the result of rejected romantic advances.  Some folks just take rejection poorly.  How many news articles do we see about white, black or Hispanic guys who kill their ex-wives (like the white one this winter in SoCal, in which the perp, dressed as Santa, shot other people at the party and set the house on fire)?  Playing up the racial angle on this doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.  It obviously wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime, as the victim was also Chinese.  Possibly screening foreign students to weed out the unstable lunatics would help, but keep in mind that this is an American university campus.  Most of the unstable lunatics at these places are the faculty and staff members.</p>
