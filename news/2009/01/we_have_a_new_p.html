<h1><a href="https://www.newswithviews.com/PaulProctor/proctor171.htm">We Have a New President Now</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Proctor, News With Views, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of my wife&rsquo;s friends told her on Tuesday that someone she knew had been renting a house to a single African-American woman for several years. The lady had apparently never missed a payment or even been late with one.</p>
<p>But, for some strange reason, immediately after Barack Obama was elected to office last November, the woman reportedly stopped paying rent. When politely questioned about it, she told her landlord: &#8220;We have a new president now and some things are going to change.&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Well, that&rsquo;s fine, but you still have to pay your rent,&#8221; to which she reiterated: &#8220;No, we have a new president now  &mdash;  and some things are going to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I understand, the rent has yet to be paid.</p>
<p>Later that same day, while watching ABC News coverage of the inauguration with my wife over lunch, hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer were joined by Donna Brazile, a Democratic African-American author, educator and political activist, who gave a humorous account of her snatching the complementary fleece blanket she found abandoned in Barack Obama&rsquo;s chair after the swearing-in ceremony. Apparently she wanted a souvenir of the momentous occasion and when the opportunity arose, she took it.</p>
<p>As they all laughed about it, Gibson responded playfully to her candid admission by saying: &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to check with the legal staff and find out if that&rsquo;s a felony or a misdemeanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazile then gave a stern look into the camera and said: &#8220;We have a black president  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious though; is there an underlying belief among some African-Americans that since we now have a black president, Obama will be providing them special privileges that somehow supersede the laws of the land rendering them no longer accountable for illegal, immoral or unruly behavior because of their skin color or ethnicity?</p>
<p>Did Obama not call for &#8220;a new era of responsibility&#8221; in his address to the nation or did he mean a new era of entitlements for people of color?</p>
<p>Is Barack Obama America&rsquo;s new president or just the new African-American president?</p>

			<p>Blacks have been getting &#8220;special privileges&#8221; for years now under affirmative action and the PC media. Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they get even more now. And if you&rsquo;re white, the establishment is against you. To survive, whites will have to look to each other for help and unity. And who knows, we may come out a little stronger than the pampered elites.</p>

<p>The vast majority of blacks can neither reason nor logic in coherent terms.  What is nonsense to every other race is perfectly logical to them.  They truly believe that, because a black was elected, somehow they now have taken over the country.</p>
<p>On this site, one of our black posters, blackvet, admonished our posters here not long ago by saying something to the effect that we weren&rsquo;t going to be commenting as we have been after Jan 20th.  What advantage or control he thinks blacks will have over whites is known only to a black mind that can&rsquo;t understand much and lives in a fantasy world because of it.</p>
<p>As Donna Brazil did, many have already revealed their racist attitudes, and many more will do the same, because they can&rsquo;t control their tongues, and because their arrogance blinds them to many things.</p>
<p>This black president may do more to raise white awareness of black biases and hatred of whites than we could with ten million members.</p>

<p>Indeed, that is exactly what you now have in the good old USA, and it is not just &#8220;some African-Americans,&#8221; but a vast majority of them. By my best guesses: 2/3rds now feel they are above the law, and just under 1/3rd feel the law now &#8220;advantages&#8221; them. Roughly 1% to 5% of them, probably understand that the world is not their shrimp cocktail and glass of Champaign, to be devoured and swilled. </p>
<p>Rent?</p>
<p>Who needs to pay that to Whitey or anyone else?</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we have a new president now &mdash; and some things are going to change&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Black criminal types and sociopaths will (and do) use any excuse to justify their bad behavior, election not withstanding. This is nothing new, and as far as Donna Brazile&rsquo;s blanket episode, so what? She grabbed a souvenir, big deal, I would have done the same if the opportunity presented itself. It was a friggin&rsquo; discarded blanket, for cryin&rsquo; out loud. This author is making it sound like she was asking for reparations for slavery!</p>

			<p>The answer is yes, and when the punishment for these transgressions is far less than what it should be, or non-existent, they&rsquo;ll believe that they have special privileges.</p>

			<p>It beggars belief, but it may be that some blacks believe reparations are here.</p>
<p>There was that black woman who was recorded at an Obama election rally saying that she would no longer have to worry about car payments or mortgage when Obama gets elected.</p>

			<p>I actually hope this silliness continues. It provides unenlightened Whites an excellent snapshot of what is really on the minds of the Blacks they claim to be so &#8220;enriched&#8221; by. Secondly, it would seem many Blacks are in for a very rude awakening in regard to just how little magical &#8220;change&#8221; is really headed their way! It could be entertaining at least&hellip;   </p>

<p>I listened to it&hellip;didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or scream at that woman&rsquo;s ignorance!</p>
<p>Like, lady  &mdash;  if you aren&rsquo;t rich, then why try to make payments on a car if you can&rsquo;t afford it?  If we purchase a car, we figure out how big of a payment we can make per month and stick with it.</p>
<p>Like another poster here said&hellip;do these people know something we don&rsquo;t?  Why do these people think Obama&rsquo;s coming to the rescue or something?</p>
<p>Hope?  Sounds more like HYPE!</p>

<p>Unfortunately Paul, Obama will never be made to look like he failed at anything.  The entire campaign and the MSM&rsquo;s fawning over him for the last 2 years proves that.  Whatever problems he encounters or whatever happens in the country over the next 4 years will be layed squarely in the lap of the former president - George W. Bush.  I guarantee we will hear that Obama was just trying to clean up Bush&rsquo;s mess.  Blacks have been getting a free pass for over 45 years now.  And even though we have an educated black man as president, he&rsquo;s still going to be portrayed as a victim of white racism.<br>

			<p>Jon-Erik sounds like a friend of mine who won&rsquo;t even talk about race much anymore.  She used to be really active in white people&rsquo;s stuff too.  The last time I managed to get her on the subject she said that it could be a good thing for white people to become a minority.  I asked her why because wouldn&rsquo;t it be safer to be the majority.  She just sighed and said that white people keep giving away the store and don&rsquo;t even seem to notice that there is always less on the shelves.  </p>
<p>She says that black people are about 12% of the population and have a huge amount of power for such a small part of the population.  She says that Asians are about 3% of the population and have a huge amount of power for such a small racial part of the population.  I don&rsquo;t think that she is just being hateful because she is married to a man and seems to like me even though she knows that I am gay.  But she told me that gays are about 10% of the population and have a huge amount of power for such a small group of people and are the only group with many white people any good at looking out for their own kind.  She says that white people have little power even where they are the majority because they have no loyalty to each other.  She says that if white people become a minority they might be forced to stop taking care of everyone except their own kind. </p>
<p>Then she was just too mad to talk about it anymore and changed the subject like she always does.    </p>

<p>I wish you were right Paul, and I agree with you that Obama will make a mess of his presidency, but that&rsquo;s where our opinions diverge.  </p>
<p>When ever has black failure been the fault of anyone other than whites?  Why will Obama&rsquo;s ineptitude be judged any differently? As is the case with other blacks, his successes will be his own, but his failures will be the fault of racist whites. </p>
<p>In all fairness the blanket video seemed to be strictly humorous; I thought it was rather funny. I mean, imagine if a white implied that a black president would be more tolerant of crime.</p>

Even blacks have quoted that they got the life of Riley ever since the Republican party of neocons and MLK DNC plus Limbaugh Bushs and Obamas hero.</p>
<p>Its one big party off whitey cause our ancestors were pulled out of their 3rd world jungle paradise and sent to work as slaves for 250 yrs before the Great Emancipator preemptively invaded and killed off the whites in the south and set up a new central neocon Marx government. </p>

			<p>Wow this website really shows how we still have ignorant people in 2009. The fact that people will be happy with their country in shambles and their fellow country living in chaos rather than see their country succed under the leadership of a black shows how ignorance is still prevelant in America. Your best and brightest are dying in deserts (where a highly intelligent white man put them there), god knows how many terrorist have come through our borders (left open by many white men), and yet you would rather see your country fail just because there is black at the helm. None your comments have facts to back them up. If after 8yrs of Bush you have a problem with Obama call me and I will personally help you pack up and leave.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a weird statement, but I guess it&rsquo;s too be expected. You&rsquo;re assuming that the country&rsquo;s going to succeed under Obama, but everything points in the opposite direction. Considering the crowd he&rsquo;s put into place in the Administration, nothing much is going to change. It rarely does regardless of which party gets into power, but he&rsquo;s almost certain to make things worse, not better.  His economic stimulus package is guaranteed to make the problems worse  &mdash;  probably a lot worse  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m expecting to see a collapse of the currency in the next few years, maybe sooner than that. He&rsquo;ll expand government even more than the Republicans did. He&rsquo;ll probably pass hate-speech laws. He&rsquo;ll probably quit enforcing the immigration laws  &mdash;  not that Bush was doing much to protect the borders. Bush was a disaster and Obama&rsquo;s going to be even worse. Guaranteed.</p>
<p>The idea that we would rather see the country fail because there&rsquo;s a black at the helm is complete and total nonsense. You seem to get everything backwards here. Always. We don&rsquo;t WANT to see the country fail just to make Obama look bad. We EXPECT it to fail precisely because he&rsquo;s in power. There&rsquo;s a big difference. If you had spent any time reading back through this site, you&rsquo;d understand that most people here couldn&rsquo;t stand Bush or the neoconservative crowd who were pulling his strings. Personally, I think the country will be doing good to survive all the damage he caused, but Obama is just going to make it worse. Obama and McCain were both disasters. McCain was a neoconservative and Obama&rsquo;s a left-wing multicult type who&rsquo;s being presented as some kind of Messiah. Neither of them have a clue what&rsquo;s wrong with this country or how to fix it. Both parties are basically the same once you cut through all their rhetoric. This bizarre idea that Obama is going to &#8220;make it all better&#8221; has no basis in fact and he&rsquo;s a complete disaster as far as whites are concerned.</p>

			<p>rational thinker: I want this country to fail because it has ceased to be my country, just as many people in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia wanted their countries to fail.  What is the &#8220;success&#8221; that BHO and his idolaters want?  Unlimited immigration and the displacement of the American people by foreigners.  More free stuff for everyone, paid for by the minority that is truly productive.  And government control of the population, by government control of the economy, education, and media.  I am an American patriot.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;Rational Thinker&#8221; who posted that he will help us pack our things has got it backwards.  If he thinks that Bo-Rock is going to &#8220;fix&#8221; anything in this country besides elections, he&rsquo;s obviously un-hinged mentally.  I&rsquo;d like him to list for me Bo-Rocks accomplishments in the Illinois senate or the US senate, besides voting &#8220;present&#8221; on his liberal cronies bills.  When Obamma&rsquo;s done &#8220;fixing&#8221; this country, there won&rsquo;t be anything left of value to pack.  Want proof?  Look at NYC during Dinkin&rsquo;s tenure.  Check out Detroit, take a look at Cleveland.  These fine cities all had (or have) a black man running them.  You won&rsquo;t find people busting down the doors to move in!!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bittersweet happiness rational thinker, (my oh my, isn&rsquo;t that a lofty name). Folks here are not ignorant, we don&rsquo;t want failure because BO is black, we want Socialism to fail,(like it has everywhere else in the world). What we recognize is that Obama and his Leftwing cadres have had to bring the country to chaos in order to try to establish their Socialist utopia. No-one who is happy &amp; comfortable wants Socialism, only the desperate, only those who can see no other way than to take a chance on something, someone, anyone, just different!.  Socialists Dodd, Frank, Rimes, Carter and many more all willfully attempted to destroy the economy of this nation with their interference in the banking system. F. Mae and F Mac are both creations of the Left, the housing situation that has left so many bereft of their dreams is precisely what Obama needed to get people to take a chance on him, -  a virtually unelectable candidate, lacking experience and carrying remarkably unpleasant baggage. Combine this with the 4-5 years of Alinsky style indoctrination promulgated by European and American Left-wingers, relentlessly telling us how bad things are, how hopeless everything is, how it will get so much worse, how evil, stupid,incompetant Bush is (I don&rsquo;t like him much but please, he&rsquo;s not Hitler), the war, the economy, the gas prices, Candidate McCain, Katrina, global warming/cooling/dimming/shrinking(all our fault natch!) and you have the perfect storm of opportunity for CHANGE and HOPE to permeate the minds of so many.  And it worked. As I said at the outset, what some of us take a bittersweet solace in is that the foolish and the schemers who hope to change this country to satisfy their need for power, get their come-uppance with failure. We certainly don&rsquo;t relish the less fortunate becoming victims of Socialism.<br>

<p>First, RT, I suggest using spellchecker before posting or people will think you can&rsquo;t spell nor speak standard American English,  meaning you are an illiterate and ignorant person. Further evidence of your ignorance is demonstrated when you wrote &#8220;people will be happy with their country in shambles.&#8221;  I have read not one comment about anyone claiming to be happy with the country in shambles. Obviously you can read and write (not spell correctly) but, do not have the capacity to understand the message.</p>

			<p>&#8220;One of my wife&rsquo;s friends told her on Tuesday that someone she knew had been renting a house to a single African-American woman for several years. The lady had apparently never missed a payment or even been late with one.</p>
<p>But, for some strange reason, immediately after Barack Obama was elected to office last November, the woman reportedly stopped paying rent. When politely questioned about it, she told her landlord: &ldquo;We have a new president now and some things are going to change.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s fine, but you still have to pay your rent,&rdquo; to which she reiterated: &ldquo;No, we have a new president now &mdash; and some things are going to change.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I understand, the rent has yet to be paid.</p>
<p>Although I am an extreme radical White nationalist I doubt the veracity of this story.  I don&rsquo;t believe it.  The election was in November.  If the woman withheld the December rent why did this landlord not serve her with  a notice of unlawful retainer?</p>
<p>This Paul Proctor says the woman always paid her rent on time.  So the woman must have paid her rent on or before November first.  The election was November fourth. Paul Proctor then goes on to say the woman immediately stopped paying rent.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  She didn&rsquo;t have to make another paynment for 4 weeks, the end of November.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of Obama mania and black disfunction without making them up.  </p>
<p>I have heard a lot of blacks talking and rejoicing about the election.  I haven&rsquo;t heard any expectations about not paying rent or mortgages.  I&rsquo;m sure there are examples of blacks (and whites) unrealistic expectations Paul Proctor can cite without making something up.<br>

			<p>Obama cannot &#8216;fail&rsquo; for the following reason;<br>
His failure to deliver on all of his promises (y&rsquo;know - curing and solving everything) will be blamed on George.W.Bush because Obama inherited an &#8216;incuruable mess&rsquo; from the Bush Administration. I think the excuse has been already rehearsed.</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>Race Realist said s/he doubts the veracity of the story. I agree with you Race Realist, that story does not have the ring of truth to it. The law still operates even amidst Hope and Change, besides there are several taped interviews with people with views like Brazil and with others in the general population who have been duped into believing Leftwing promises.<br>
 The record shows that Obama and his crony Ayers&rsquo; teaching methodology failed to bring the black children of Chicago up to national standards. I&rsquo;m concerned that is it those children, and millions of others like them who now as adults believe that &#8216;white don&rsquo;t embrace what is right&rsquo; and that their time has come to be given what they are due. <br>

			<p>As soos as the Blacks are fooled by Obama, I start grinning. 600 million Dollar for Obama´s election campaign and 180 million Dollar for the inauguration were not invested for the Black Community. </p>

			<p>Did anybody hear Jay Z and Little Jeezy about Obama? It&rsquo;s linked from the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor and the Millertime show on YouTube. WARNING: OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE. Even more offensive behavior, and<br>
we can expect more and more of this in the next 4 years. <br>

<p>Yes, and  I predict that we&rsquo;ll be told that it will take a full 8 years to fix it. Nothing less. The first 4 will be just a start.</p>
<p><i>The record shows that Obama and his crony Ayers&rsquo; teaching methodology failed to bring the black children of Chicago up to national standards. </i></p>
<p>In that case, if you can&rsquo;t bring the blacks up to to white standards, then you&rsquo;ll just  have to bring the whites down to black standards.   Can&rsquo;t have any disparity between the races! That would be  racism.<br>

			<p>Today, someone close to me, was telling me that on one the major television networks last week, there was mention of the possibly that Obama&rsquo;s father was married to another woman when he was with Obama&rsquo;s mother. If this is the case, then not only is he the first black president, but he will be the first BASTARD president as well.  </p>

<p>Well, I agree wholeheartedly with your evaluation of this confused poster, Joe.  I read what he wrote twice and it was apparent that he doesn&rsquo;t understand much, including what he wrote, because it all runs together and doesn&rsquo;t really make any credible points.  It&rsquo;s obvious his intent was to just denigrate the posters here, by calling them ignorant, (when he actually meant stupid) but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s completely unaware his entire post is an excellent example of ignorance and a lack of intelligence.</p>

			<p>Blacks believe Obama has empowered them to do whatever they please to whites.  This kind of thinking will foment the worst racial conflict between whites and blacks in our history.</p>
<p>Whatever gains blacks have made in civil rights will vanish overnight.  Whites will be forced to face the sobering fact that blacks and whites can not share the same nation in harmony&hellip;      </p>
