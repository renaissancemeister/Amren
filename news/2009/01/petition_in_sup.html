			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PetitionOnline, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To: The Dutch Government</p>
<p>WHEREAS Geert Wilders has exercised his fundamental human right of freedom of expression and spoken out, with facts and evidence, of the threat posed by radical Islam;</p>
<p>WHEREAS certain elements within Islamic communities have threatened a boycott of Dutch goods if Geert Wilders is not punished by the Dutch government for exercising his freedom of expression; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS certain elements in Dutch industry and the Dutch government are suggesting that Geert Wilders be prosecuted civilly or criminally, in order to prevent such a boycott;</p>
<p>IT IS RESOLVED that, in the event that the Dutch government attempts, in any way, to punish or prosecute Geert Wilders, civilly or criminally, for exercising his freedom of expression, the undersigned will initiate a boycott of any and all Dutch goods.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about fifteen minutes long.  WATCH IT!  Wilders did an awesome job.</p>
<p>I just signed the petition, myself.  Geert Wildners is a hero!</p>

			<p>I have signed also.</p>
<p>I believe that the Dutch government has been paid off by the muslims.</p>
<p>Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh were murdered by the muslims.</p>
<p>The Dutch royalty visited a muslim place instead of attending to van Gogh&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>I believe they would also murder Geert Wilders, but due to public reaction they have instead decided to cut a deal with the Dutch government to prosecute and jail Wilders.</p>
<p>I cannot understand how the Dutch people can allow a government to destroy the country.</p>
<p>Just like LePen in France, Geert Wilders is unfortunately not well enough supported by the public.</p>
<p>There should be rioting in the streets against the government for the travesty that is taking place against Wilders.</p>
<p>And in the USA the muslims continue to come in and make and get demands given inspite of 9-11.</p>
<p>We are at war&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;except only a few people of intelligence know it and the masses are either brainwashed or brain dead.</p>

			<p> I also signed the petition (#18153). I can&rsquo;t believe anybody tolerates the absurd behavior of muslims. They claim islam is a religion of peace but actions speak much louder than words. Enough!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly true.  This would come under the guise of &#8220;lobbying.&#8221;  Keep in mind also there are many bureaucrats who push this kind of treason because they have a vested financial interest in doing so.  They must justify their salaries by going after &#8220;evil racists&#8221; or they&rsquo;ll see their agencies&rsquo; budgets (and their jobs) cut.  Such is the evil known as Leftism.</p>

<p>This should be our number one agenda. We must spread the world about muslims and the islamization of western civilization. This is far threating to our way of life than some kids watching rap videos and wearing saggy pants.</p>
<p>The word must be spread warning the entire world (not just western nations but developing nations as well) because this is going on in europe but it will be happening in our grandchildrens life times. Very fan of this website should leave a comment because i&rsquo;ve never seen such a threat to our civilization since illegal immigration. <br>

			<p>I have signed too (#20,182).<br>
What is happening to Wilders will happen to anyone who challenges Islam. Stand up and fight for Geert NOW.<br>
Remember what Winston Churchill said about Islam:<br>
&#8220;A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property‹either as a child, a wife, or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.<br>
No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>HOW TRUE TODAY</p>

			<p>As a Canadian, I have a SPECIAL hate for government bodies that persecute and prosecute native Whites and Christians who question the &#8220;peacefulness&#8221; of Islam. Here we have Star Chambers, so called &#8220;human rights&#8221; commisions, who&rsquo;s sole activity is finding powerless Whites to crush for saying anything about any &#8220;protected class&#8221; (an official term BTW)-one of the most vocal protected class being muslim extremists. I signed the petition. We need one also for the next victim of Canada&rsquo;s racial heresy inquisitors.</p>

			<p>Islam is NOT a religion, but a totalitarian political dogma like Nazism or Stalinism. There leadership are doctors and engineers who have dedicated their lives to destroying the West. <br>
The most dangerous thing is that they are really excellent subversive War fighters; Islam has penetrated deeply into our state department, universities, Department of Defense, and is buying off our elected representitives with billions in oil money. The Saudis have funded over a thousand Mosques where radical anti American Jihad teachings are shouted, hidden behind the walls of political correctness. Europe is almost as good as gone, with evaporating white populations and exploding, aggressive Muslim populations. <br>
Exposing the Jihad is essential to all Americans. </p>

			<p>I would urge every reader of AmRen to watch the brilliant series of anti-Islam videos on YouTube, posted by the great English comedian/atheist/thorn-in-the-side-of-the-PC-establishment, Pat Condell.</p>
<p>His most recent offering explores the moral idiocy of the Dutch government in hounding Wilders on behalf of their Muslim block vote.</p>

			<p>White Canadian is right on.</p>
<p>From another white Canadian I can confirm the actions of human rights commissions both federal and provincial in taking action on behalf of muslims against white canadians that dare to speak the truth.</p>
<p>An iman at Calgary and Richard Warman are responsible for much.  Ezra Levant was a victim of one of these kanagaroo courts and was found innocent but at great cost to himself.  The muslim iman of course had the government pay for the prosecution which failed.  Perhaps the iman should pay the legal cost and be fined.</p>
<p>We are doomed in Canada by years of uncontrolled immigration.  The extent is now so bad that in time we will see the government representation be non white and the rules will be changed.</p>
<p>We are truly screwed by corrupt politicians and dim witted publics.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech in Canada is history.</p>
<p>Only the foreigners have freedoms to do as they wish.</p>
<p>We have three traitor parties in Canada.  Liberal, Conservative and NDP.</p>
<p>Time for something like the BNP.</p>
<p>The separatist Bloc Quebecois is busy fighting the english and in the meantime they also are being over-run with foreign trash.</p>
<p>Check out the flak from the little town of Herouxville that set out a code of acceptable conduct.  But the original code was unfortunately amended as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;The town council in Hérouxville amended its provocative immigrant code of conduct Monday night to remove certain rules.</p>
<p>Council adopted the changes, which include removing references to &#8220;no stoning of women in public&#8221; and &#8220;no female circumcision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something is wrong, really wrong with our elected officials, many voters and the media.</p>

			<p>I signed the petition.  Since the Dutch government has caved into the boycott threats of Muslims and indulged in a farcical politically-motivated prosecution of a man who was only telling the truth, we simply don&rsquo;t need Dutch-made products.  I wonder if they think they&rsquo;re going to be able to sell the hams and beer they produce to the Muslims they seem to prefer to us.</p>
