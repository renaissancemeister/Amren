			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duncan Hengest, American Renaissance, May 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama is today the most prominent former resident of the state of Hawaii. His ability to appeal to voters of all races  &mdash;  especially to whites who want to be able to congratulate themselves on their willingness to vote for a black  &mdash;  has highlighted the popular conception of Hawaii as a tropical multi-racial paradise. And, indeed, on the surface, things seem calm on the green, balmy archipelago, which received 7.5 million visitors in 2006. But all is not well. Hawaii is a tinderbox, with a population different from the rest of the country. It is the only state that has never had a white majority, and it has a powerful Asian political class that never loses sight of its ethnic interests. At the same time, Native Hawaiians are more restless than ever, and many support an increasingly truculent sovereignty movement.</p>
<p><b>Rejected Many Times</b></p>
<p>In August 1959, President Eisenhower admitted Hawaii as the 50th state. From the White House, he proclaimed, &#8220;We know that she is ready to do her part to make this Union a stronger Nation.&#8221; Americans had rejected Hawaiian statehood many times before, but this time Ike was right on the political money. His contemporaries had a soft spot for the sunny Pacific islands, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, like the fall of the Alamo, had been immortalized in the nation&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>It had taken a long fight to get Hawaii into the Union. The territory first applied for statehood in 1903, but was rejected, because Congress did not want a majority non-white state. Over the years, Congress repeatedly rejected its applications for the same reason. Lyndon Johnson, who became Senate majority leader in 1954, blocked admission because he was afraid Hawaiian congressmen would vote to end segregation. He agreed to admission in 1959 only because Alaska had already come in earlier that year with a solid white majority.</p>
<p>Hawaii, therefore, had the second-longest wait of any state between application and admission: 56 years. Only New Mexico had a longer wait  &mdash;  62 years  &mdash;  and did not get in until the 1910 census showed it had a white majority.</p>
<p>What was an obstacle to statehood is now, of course, an official source of pride. As the City of Honolulu&rsquo;s website claims, &#8220;One of the greatest assets of the City and County of Honolulu is the ethnic, cultural, and social diversity of its population. The City and County of Honolulu takes great pride in this diversity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the census, in 2006, whites were 25 percent of the population, Hawaiian Natives and Pacific Islanders were 22 percent, while the largest group was Asians at 42 percent (blacks are 3 percent and Hispanics are 8 percent). It was, of course, whites who brought the Asians.</p>
<p>When Calvinist missionaries first arrived in Hawaii it was a Polynesian kingdom. After converting most of the population, the missionaries stayed on as the governing elite and grew rich through real estate, shipping, and agriculture. Sugar planters imported Asians to work the cane fields, dramatically changing the islands&rsquo; population. Congress passed a sugar tariff that left Hawaii out of the fold, and in 1893 the planters organized a coup, and overthrew the monarchy. Hawaii was a nominally independent republic for five years until the United States annexed it as a territory in 1898.</p>
<p>Even by 1920, the great racialist writer Lothrop Stoddard could see that Asians were in the ascendency. As he wrote in <cite>The Rising Tide of Color:</cite> &#8220;These Asiatics arrived as agricultural laborers to work on the plantations. But they did not stay there. Saving their wages, they pushed vigorously into all the middle walks of life. The Hawaiian fisherman and the American artisan or shopkeeper were alike ousted by ruthless undercutting.&#8221; He went on to warn that &#8220;the Americans are being literally encysted as a small and dwindling aristocracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The aristocracy has continued to dwindle. Since statehood, all but one of Hawaii&rsquo;s senators have been Asian. Today, Governor Linda Lingle and long-time congressman Neil Abercrombie are two rare white faces in an otherwise Asian  &mdash;  largely Japanese  &mdash;  political class. Asians are considered the model minority, but they have caused problems in the past and could do so in the future.</p>
<p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, a Japanese Zero pilot crash-landed on the island of Niihau, where several resident Japanese rallied to his defense and killed a Native Hawaiian before they were overpowered. Although the Japanese on Hawaii were not relocated, the islands were under martial law throughout the war for fear of Japanese disloyalty and spying.</p>
<p>Ever since the state joined the Union, Hawaii&rsquo;s Asian lawmakers have followed the liberal line on race. The 1964 Civil Rights Act  &mdash;  a disaster for whites  &mdash;  was held up by filibustering Southern senators until a bi-partisan coalition led by Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Hawaii&rsquo;s two Asian senators, Hiram Fong and Daniel Inouye, gathered the 60 votes necessary for cloture. The result was exactly what Lyndon Johnson had feared in 1954.</p>
<p>Daniel Inouye was decorated for combat in Italy during the Second World War, but his Japanese ethnic interests remain strong. He supported his fellow Japanese-American, Congressman Norman Mineta of California, in the push to compensate the Japanese relocated during the war. This successful raid on the Treasury has been the precedent for everyone else who is claiming damages for the white man&rsquo;s alleged past crimes. And Sen. Inouye is still not satisfied. His proposed S381 would draw up plans to compensate Japanese from Latin America who were either interned during the war or deported to Axis countries. Japanese-Peruvians, for example, who were in the US illegally and were pitched out could conceivably have a claim on us. Sen. Inouye has the strong support of his fellow senator from Hawaii, Daniel Akaka, who is of Chinese origin.</p>
<p>The two Hawaii senators also sponsored &#8220;the Apology Resolution,&#8221; passed by Congress on the 100th anniversary of the 1893 coup, in which the federal government offered &#8220;an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.&#8221; Based on very suspect historical grounds, the bill passed the Senate after just one hour of debate with only five senators present. Three of the five spoke against the bill, with only Senators Akaka and Inouye in favor. There was no debate at all on the floor of the House.</p>
<p>Even at the time, some people saw that the apology would unleash Native Hawaiian nationalism. When President Clinton signed it  &mdash;  apologies were his specialty  &mdash;  Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington likened it to Serbian nationalist propaganda before Yugoslavia&rsquo;s civil war. He feared that the pattern of resentments and appeasement that led to violence in Yugoslavia was being repeated, and warned that &#8220;this resolution is a signpost pointing toward that dark and bitter road.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Road to Insurgency?</b></p>
<p>He was prescient. The independence movement has taken some ugly turns, as it sinks roots into an increasingly sharp native sense of alienation from the white man&rsquo;s civilization. Although their own ancestors brought in Yankee missionaries, today&rsquo;s Hawaiians are returning to traditional Polynesian gods. This has strange consequences. Hawaii should be the state with the cheapest energy because volcanic activity on the larger islands would be a good source for geothermal power. The volcanoes remain underdeveloped because of the resistance of Native Hawaiians who fear power stations will bother the goddess Pele. In the summer of 2007, Pele worshipers celebrated an anti-geothermal victory after stopping development in Puna, on the big island of Hawaii. Hawaii may be the only place on earth where geothermal energy is sacrificed to religion.</p>
<p>There are other cultural clashes. Most whites think sharks are a dangerous nuisance, but early Hawaiians worshiped, cared for, and protected sharks as <i>&#8216;aumakua,</i> or ancestral gods, while others depended on them as a source of food and tools. There are other sharp disagreements, since ancient Hawaiian beliefs can be dredged up to oppose just about anything whites take for granted: telescopes, taro plant research, ferry services, etc.</p>
<p>All of these conflicts feed the independence movement, which has added a kind of guerrilla theater to its mix of pressure tactics. At the 2006 Statehood Day ceremony, for example, protesters heckled speakers at the Iolani Palace in Honolulu, calling for secession and restoration of the monarchy. The police kept their distance, and tensions mounted. A few politicians continued with the ceremony, but the band walked off early.</p>
<p>One of the protesters was clearly high. When a female reporter asked him about his dilated pupils, he explained, &#8220;I can smoke ice if I want to. I belong to the Kingdom of Hawaii.&#8221; He then dropped his pants and exposed himself to the reporter and several children.</p>
<p>Some would say Hawaii is already on the road to insurgency. The Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement has its own flag, its own legal foundation, its own religious interpretations of the &#8220;Promised Land,&#8221; as well as Internet-based propaganda (see Hawaii-nation.org). In 2006, the University of Hawaii at Hilo surveyed Hawaiian natives and reached disquieting conclusions: &#8220;While fewer than 6 percent thought violence was justifiable in pursuit of sovereignty, over 53 percent expressed the belief that it was inevitable. Of interest is the finding that less than one fourth of the sample reported that they think that the desire to gain sovereignty <em>will not</em> result in violence in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congressional apologies only encourage extremism, and the federal government continues unwittingly to aid insurgency. The State of Hawaii Office of Hawaiian Affairs, one of two state agencies that serve only Native Hawaiians, openly boasts there are more than 160 federally funded programs exclusively for natives. How were those programs established? For decades, Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka served on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. These were curious appointments, since there are no Indian tribes on Hawaii. Whenever bills came before the committee for special favors for Indians  &mdash;  housing, welfare, education, medicine  &mdash;  the two senators from Hawaii quietly added &#8220;and Native Hawaiians&#8221; to the bill.</p>
<p>Multi-culturalism gives Native Hawaiians the moral authority to agitate for independence, and permits no reply from whites or the federal or state governments. Lawmakers wrapped up in the cult of white guilt are about to recognize a separate Native Hawaiian government that would be able to organize and direct subversive action. To this end, Sen. Akaka is hard at work on the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007, the House version of which has already passed.</p>
<p>Supporters claim that a Native Hawaiian government would be no different from the tribal councils that run casinos on New England reservations. They are far off the mark. New England&rsquo;s Indian tribes were smashed centuries ago, while Hawaiians are building towards a full-fledged separatist movement.</p>
<p>Many whites fail to realize it, but many Native Hawaiians hate them. On Oahu, the town of Waimanalo is becoming a no-go area. As the <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite> noted in 2005, &#8220;&#8216;Haole [white man], go home!&rsquo; and variations of whites-aren&rsquo;t-welcome are occasionally shouted from front porches as a reminder that this isn&rsquo;t Waikiki. It&rsquo;s a different world. Locals rule here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locals rule in more and more areas, though mainlanders who go only to the tourist spots would never know it. Many Americans got their first inkling of anti-white hostility only when MTV reported that when the musician Jewel lived in Hawaii for a few months as a child she was beaten up every day because she was white. Whites can live in peace in Hawaii if they attend private schools and live in secluded suburbs. One Hawaiian white told me that &#8220;you really can&rsquo;t go to the public schools. The schools really just teach a gangster mentality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schools have a tradition called &#8220;Kill Haole Day,&#8221; which means beating up whites on the last day of school. In 1999, when the state legislature considered hate-crimes legislation, the law was nearly derailed because of Kill Haole Day. Legislators noted that it was a long-standing tradition in some schools, and that unless it were completely eliminated, tough hate-crimes legislation could make the state liable for attacks on whites. The bill was gutted.</p>
<p>A particularly nasty attack in 2006 was linked to Kill Haole Day. Non-white students from Keaau High School on the big island skipped class to attack students at the Waters of Life Public Charter School in Hilo. First they broke into the Girl Scout office and attacked a manager. Then they broke off a door and invaded a classroom where Waters of Life students were taking the Hawaii State Assessment exam. The Keaau students punched teachers and students, knocking them to the ground. A victim later wrote, &#8220;We were vulnerable and defenseless against such an unthinkable, senseless, brutal assault. We are in shock. We are scared. We were terrorized.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February 2007, a family of Native Hawaiians beat an Army sergeant and his wife unconscious in front of their three-year-old daughter after a fender-bender in a parking lot. The man&rsquo;s windpipe was crushed, and he went into convulsions. In January of this year, on the big island, men described as &#8220;Pacific Islanders&#8221; beat up nine white campers in a beach park and told them to get off the island. In all these cases, the Hawaiian police either moved slowly or didn&rsquo;t get involved at all.</p>
<p>It is a serious matter when a large part of the population of a state is not of the founding stock, and where leaders are claiming territorial sovereignty. Wars of insurgency are fought by slowly expanding areas that are outside government control. What Bernard Fall wrote about Vietnam in 1965 is a description of a classic insurgency: &#8220;Saigon was deliberately <em>encircled</em> and <em>cut off</em> from the hinterland with a &#8216;wall&rsquo; of dead village chiefs.&#8221; This is by no means the case in Hawaii, but no other state has the same potential. The time will come when pro-statehood Native Hawaiian politicians  &mdash;  already rare  &mdash;  will have to watch their backs.</p>
<p>Insurgency is the most common form of war  &mdash;  and the most bitter. Insurgencies don&rsquo;t end with a neat treaty; their fires are beaten down to embers that can alight in the future. The British have had trouble in Ireland for nearly 700 years.</p>
<p>A Hawaiian insurgency could certainly be contained. The state is still packed with soldiers and Marines, as well as the Pacific Fleet. Even if the state and local police were overwhelmed, troops could quickly restore order. The feds should have a plan for this, and Hawaii should not be on the base-closure list.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hawaii should under no circumstances be allowed to accept a substantial number of refugees  &mdash;  especially Asians  &mdash;  who could spark a crisis. Lebanon&rsquo;s civil war began when thousands of Palestinians were dumped in the area, overwhelming the social structure.</p>
<p><b>Independence?</b></p>
<p>Some whites would argue that Hawaii should be shucked off and given independence, along with largely non-white Guam and Puerto Rico, but there are several arguments against this. First, Hawaii has great strategic value. During the War in the Pacific, it was the front line for half of 1942, and Hawaii remains a key link in America&rsquo;s outer defenses. It is a power-projection platform that supports American interests in the Pacific and Far East, and it has radar stations, sonar networks, and radio listening posts that endlessly search the Pacific for hostile activity.</p>
<p>America has three major rivals in the Pacific: the Japanese, the Russians, and the Chinese. Today, relations with Russia and Japan are peaceful, but there is potential for a clash with China. Hawaii will be an important part of any American military effort if there is conflict in the Far East (though the presence of large numbers of highly intelligent and potentially hostile Asians could complicate a major campaign). A small, weak, Asian-run, independent Hawaii could even align itself with China.</p>
<p>A successful Hawaiian independence effort could also bring out copycats in the Southwest, where immigration has been stoking separatist sentiment for years.</p>
<p>If the United States intends to keep Hawaii, there should be a major effort to settle the state with North American whites. Whatever policies we pursue, the entire national conversation about Hawaii needs to change. The anti-white slant that colors the Federal Government&rsquo;s outlook is supplying, cartridge by cartridge, the ammunition for a future fire fight. It is high time we thought about how to turn Hawaii away from that &#8220;dark and bitter road&#8221; Sen. Gorton foresaw for it in 1993.<br>

<p>Why is it that we want to keep these people part of the United States, again?</p>
<p>Hawaii has long been a hotbed of anti-White sentiment (during WW2, for example, the Empire of Japan anticipated a large anti-American rising if they defeated us at Midway and were able to invade the Hawaiian Islands), and as a State it has been successful only at giving Little Japan votes in the House and Senate. If they wish to secede, let them secede, and good riddance I say. </p>

<p></p>
<p>&gt; As with the example of the Zero pilot in WW2, the overwhelming majority Asians in Hawaii are likely already more supportive of any Asian nation in a future power struggle.  We will have to see if the U.S. government will use martial law to re-establish its power there.  Doing nothing and allowing anti-White, anti-U.S. activities to go unchecked for so long has probably already guaranteed that there will soon be an &#8220;uprising.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This article wants to slam the barn door hard&hellip;.just as soon as all the cows have escaped.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, Hawaii has great strategic value. During the War in the Pacific, it was the front line for half of 1942, and Hawaii remains a key link in America&rsquo;s outer defenses. It is a power-projection platform that supports American interests in the Pacific and Far East, and it has radar stations, sonar networks, and radio listening posts that endlessly search the Pacific for hostile activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>As both the Americans and the Japanese learned during WWII, the shortest route to Asia is from Alaska, not Hawaii. Even today, many of the air routes to Korea and Japan (and Russia) follow the northern arc by way of Alaska&hellip;.not directly from Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the United States intends to keep Hawaii, there should be a major effort to settle the state with North American whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>We do it every day. They are not called settlers&hellip;they are called tourists. Hawaii is so dependent on tourism from the mainland USA, that any serious violence directed against whites would dry up the tourist trade and starve the islands into submission. (This has already happened in Mexico, where violence against tourists has cost the country hundreds of millions in tourist trade.) I expect the powers in Hawaii to be smart enough to know this already and control the rowdies and thugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;A successful Hawaiian independence effort could also bring out copycats in the Southwest, where immigration has been stoking separatist sentiment for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh please&hellip;.please&hellip;.please&hellip;.please! Maybe then, the rest of the country will learn the difference between invaders (and colonists) as opposed to migrant workers (and tourists). Here in Texas, we can hardly wait for another San Jacinto.</p>

			<p>I take strong exception to many things said in this article. I think Hawaii should never have been made a state and should have been given its independence instead. Nor do I buy what he says about Hawaii&rsquo;s alleged strategic significance. Please bear in mind that the writer of this article is a military contractor and thus has a very vested interest in this. The idea that Japan (now a stable democracy, with a very low birthrate and no navy) or China (which has not even been able to impose its will on Taiwan only 100 miles away) or Russia (bankrupt, no real navy and losing half a milion people a year) are going to reach out across the Pacific and seize Hawaii and thus &#8220;compromise&#8221; America seems to me more then a little absurd. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour because America had a large military presence in the Phillipinnes which straddled Japan&rsquo;s intended supply route to the Dutch east Indies. Expanding into the Pacific WEAKENED America, not made it more secure. </p>

			<p>This reminds me of the old commercials for Hawaiian Punch fruit drink, with a short Hawaiian guy teasing, and then ultimately punching a goofy white tourist at the end of the commercial.Now I know where they got the idea for that ad campaign. </p>

			<p>Hawaii is now up for grabs.  The natives (if you can find a pure bred one) comprise such a small percentile of the population as to make them insignificant.  Most current &#8220;Hawaiians&#8221; are actually mixed breeds (Somoan, Phillipine, Chinese, Japanese etc.) anything but white.  So there is no racial legitimacy with &#8220;Hawaiian&#8221; claims.  Whites compose approximately 50 percent of the population currently, so why not make it ours?  We could use the sun.  </p>
<p>We would harvest the natural geothermal energy (unlike the superstitious so called Hawaiians who think that the volcano goddess Pele will be angry with them if they try to tap their natural resources.)  Make the islands essential self sufficient while providing a paradise retreat.</p>
<p>Hawaii has almost any concievable climate.  From desert to rain forest on the same island.  Rich farmland, ranch land, fruits and vegetables grow like crazy, the weather is temperate, it even feels good when it rains on you.  The only problem is the disgruntled &#8220;Hawaiians&#8221;, who afraid to venture forth in the real world, feel resentful and afraid to leave the islands, so they stay and gang beat down  happy go lucky white people who expect hula girls and leis and instead get hostile glares and physical abuse.  </p>
<p>Hawaii doesn&rsquo;t really belong to any one racial group, so why don&rsquo;t we add it for a little novelty, kind of like a sunny oasis away from Idaho.</p>

			<p>One of my best friends made a habit of visiting and even living in Hawaii for many years. He often told me when we talk of that tropical paradise, what utterly prejudiced people Hawaiians were towards whites, especially white males. Seems he knew what he was talking about. He also mentioned that Hawaiian women, did not have much left over for white guys, either. Guys from other races were treated friendlier. Funny how the clues in the puzzle of how other races feel about whites, keep coming together to make the solution of that puzzle clearer as time goes on, yet the emerging picture is so very lost on the liberal/progressive mentality.</p>

			<p>I have a very serious warning to everyone reading this post.  If you ever visit Hawaii, do not take back any sea shells, soil, sand, or lava rocks as souvenirs!</p>
<p>It is true that you will cursed with terrible misfortune until you wise up and send such samples back.</p>
<p>Taking lava rocks upsets Madam Pele who regards them as her children.  The internet is filled true stories of people who were foolish enough to take lava rocks.  The post office of Volcanoes National Park is filled with lava rocks being mailed back from around the world!</p>
<p>The worst thing to do for Hawaiian Islands would be to try to build facilities to harness geothermal energy from those volcanoes.  Imagine how that would really upset Madam Pele!</p>
<p>I have never been to Hawaii.  But if I ever do visit there on vacation, Madam Pele has my word of honor that I will not take any of her children.</p>
<p>On another subject concerning Hawaii, the pineapple is not native there.  Columbus and the Spanish Conquistadors brought them back to Europe from South America, Central America, and the Caribbean Islands.  But to everyone reading this post, correct me if I am inaccurate; pineapples, sugar cane and other crops, imported to be farmed on the Hawaiian Islands are the reason Hawaii even became a United States Territory in the first place.  The plantation owners lobbied Congress to make Hawaii a U.S. Territory, so they would not have to pay tariffs on the importation of their crops.</p>

			<p>I lived in Hawaii for 3 years.  Trust me, white people are hated at every turn unless their wallet is open.  If you have never been and want to see a little bit of what it can be like for white people there, rent a movie called &#8220;Race the Sun&#8221;.  It will be hard to watch as Jim Belushi acts like a no-nuts white guy chasing Halle Barry to inspire a bunch of Hawaiian kids and a couple of token whiteys to build a solar car for a race.  Seriously, watch the whole movie because you only get to see some good white backbone towards the end (even though they try to pass off a massive Samoan moron as the &#8220;hero&#8221;).  But all through this flick the whites are referred to as &#8220;Haole&#8221; and every mistake is cause of &#8220;Haole thinking&#8221;.  Hawaii is an amazing place to look at, but eventually you have to deal with the locals and the beauty evaporates very fast.  I just wonder how on earth all those Hawaiians hope to survive without Haole&rsquo;s welfare money once they become an independent nation.  And how they plan to keep from being taken over by the Japanese (who own a massive segment of the place already).  We need a way to conditionally shed places like this and Puerto Rico for a 2 year period just so people will know just how valuable all those nasty white Americans really are to them and the world.<br>

			<p>If they want independence let them have it.  It&rsquo;s not feasible to encourage a mass migration of Whites to Hawaii when parts of the mainland are falling apart too like California, New Mexico, Texas, Florida, Arizona, etc.  I only caution them to be careful what they wish for.  Pure blooded Hawaiians are only 9% of the population.  Asians are over 40% of the population and a significant number of Asian mixed people have a little Hawaiian blood in them.  It&rsquo;s obvious who will end up ruling the island if they secede and which foreign power will eventually co-opt it as their own.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;America has three major rivals in the Pacific: the Japanese, the Russians, and the Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Wars&rsquo; are being fought now by economic means, and by population movements. How many ships and aircraft a Navy has is not the sole determinant of who the rivals are. America has many potential rivals in the Pacific, including white ones. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Funny how the clues in the puzzle of how other races feel about whites, keep coming together to make the solution of that puzzle clearer as time goes on, yet the emerging picture is so very lost on the liberal/progressive mentality&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would swear that progressives are the ones in the first place, who, in their individual acts and utterances, are the ones who make up the final picture of the puzzle. All in a good cause of course. Hating whitey has become a perpetual motion machine. The glue that binds the Earth together. Diversity really is unity. Who says we can&rsquo;t all agree on some things? Even if they are diametrically opposite of the truth.  </p>

<p>    I agree. Hawaii never should never have been a state, and neither should Puerto Rico ever become a state. Both should be given their complete independance from the United States.</p>

			<p>Not much to worry about here. My uncle lives in Hawaii. He says that racial problems are not that big of a deal, other than the Hawaiian anti-White thing. But Hawaiians are only 20% of the population. The rest of the population, my uncle said, is unbelievably mixed and getting more and more unfathomably mongrelized. Even the Asians are starting to breed out. True, they still more or less run the show, but&hellip;The place is better described as an experiment in Panmixia than anything else.</p>
<p>He laughed when I brought up the Hawaiian Independence Movement. I guess some Hawaiians support it, but they are only 20%. Outside of them, next to no one supports it and everyone else thinks it&rsquo;s a really stupid idea.</p>
<p>This article is unnecessarily alarmist. There will be no Hawaiian insurgency. For one thing, most of the Hawaiians are too lazy, stoned and drunk to wake up early enough in the morning to go wage revolution.</p>

			<p>Whites in the US need to make the real Russians into our Allies. The real Russians, along with other Slavs, are an extension of our race. Having them as rivals is idiotic at this stage of history. Nordics dominated the world in the past; with more racial unity and a better understanding of the threats in an over-populated, we can at last work jointly to hold our territories. The others have racial unity and an understanding of the global racial competition taking place. Why don&rsquo;t whites? </p>

			<p>Multicultural societies the world over prove themselves to be hotbeds of animosity, turmoil and chaos without exception.</p>
<p>That the ideology gained such momentum it was able to convince mentally challenged elites throughout the entire West that diversity was a strength is an excellent example of how easy it is to control the thinking of people en masse, if the manipulators have majority control of the organs of communications.</p>
<p>The one greatest basic problem confronting societies everywhere is the contentious elements within who are not part of the homogeneous majority.</p>
<p>Instead of working toward keeping dissimilar people separated, the elites believed they could flim flam the unwashed masses into believing the opposite of reality.  &#8220;Diversity is our strength.&#8221;  Black is beautiful.&#8221; &#8220;The only difference between humans is the color of their skin,&#8221; etc.  The result of all this is living on the brink of full scale upheaval 24/7, and constant rules, regulations, and monitoring 1984 style.</p>
<p>When this latest situation burns itself out, I doubt that many same people will be eager to have another go at it for a few hundred years.</p>

			<p>Most of the crime problems are centered on the island of Oahu.  Stay away from there.  The Big Island and Maui are perfectly safe and friendly for the most part.  If any one ethnic group were to take over the island, it would be the Japanese.  They are the only group with the brains, money and drive to carry it out.  Note that the two Hawaiian senators are of Japanese extraction.  The rest are mongrelized.</p>

<p>I read the articles you posted and they are amazing.  It seems &#8216;native Hawaiians&rsquo; are treated the same way blacks are on the mainland  &mdash;  with kid gloves and every excuse possible made for their violent deviant behavior, especially if they assault Whites.</p>
<p>This case was infuriating because this was NOT a mere assault:  It was attempted murder, based on race:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;He just hit the lady like blank in the face. He didn&rsquo;t hit her softly - he hit her like a man, like full force. She flipped backwards and she was out cold for about a couple of seconds.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Young says Gerald Paakaula then turned his attention to Andrew Dussell punching him in the throat. The 26 year old dropped to the ground gasping for air, but Tsukada says the Paakaula&rsquo;s continued beating him.</p>
<p>&#8216;The son and the dad was still jumping on the guy&rsquo;s head and still hitting him. I guess [Andrew Dussell] was having a seizure or in shock, he was shaking on the ground.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the couple&rsquo;s three year old son was in the back seat of the car.</p>
<p>And this is the typical reaction from lefties everywhere viz. non-White on White crime:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The case drew widespread attention because the youth was accused of calling Andrew Dussell a &#8220;f  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   haole&#8221; before the assault took place.</p>
<p>City prosecutors declined to file hate crime charges, saying the assaults were a road rage case that did not fit under the state&rsquo;s hate crime law that covers assailants targeting victims based on race or ethnicity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If the races were reversed, you can be sure hate crimes, racial intimidation, attempted murder, and violations of Civil Rights charges would be filed.  The slobbering alphabet networks from the mainland would have shown up in force with 24-hour coverage. </p>
<p>I have been to Hawaii many times and view Native Hawaiians the same way I view blacks:  As dangerous and to be avoided at all times.  They seem to be seething with anger and filled with hatred toward Whites  &mdash;  yeah, send us your money, you haoles, but YOU stay out.</p>
<p>Cut off ALL welfare NOW and let &#8216;em have it.</p>

			<p>I was walking on the beach around 8 P.M. several years ago, with my wife, three of what they like to call natives (in early twenties) told me they wanted my cash, credit cards, and our jewelry. Two had short baseball bats and one had a knife with about a 6 inch blade. Unfortunately For Them I am a Retired Navy Seal and these three fools almost made me chuckle. Within a minutes time one had an eye removed, one had a broken arm and the third ran so fast I could not have caught him. Of course this was not reported to the police as I would have been arrested I am sure. But like they say in the credit card commercial The Look On their Faces was Priceless.I&rsquo;m sick of every punk thinking white males are their prey and their amusement. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;First, Hawaii has great strategic value. During the War in the Pacific, </p>
<p>This place no longer has any real military value, except as a party and rest place. The advent of the nuclear Aircraft carrier and nuclear submarine made it a moot posession. Now is is just a welfare drag on CONUS. I say let it go, along with Calif and D.C.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s attempted murder, when you kick somebody in the windpipe and jump on their head etc. It&rsquo;s lucky this man survived. This is beyond mere assault.</p>
<p>I agree. Let Hawaii succeed. Whites should leave, take all of their  welfare money and inventions with them and leave it to the natives.<br>

<p>Never underestimate the power of anti-white hatred.</p>
<p>And, keep in mind that only 10% of the American population in the beginning were for a war of independence against England.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take but a dedicated fraction of a population to overturn a government.  History is replete with examples.</p>
<p>Every insurrection on record was played down to near insignificance at one time by those who were terrified at the prospect, hoping their contribution on the matter would cause an abatement of sorts. </p>
<p>Non-white militancy the world over is the wave of today and the immediate future.</p>

			<p>Granted the problem of Hawaii&rsquo;s multi-culti diversity is a comparatively ancient one. With, as pointed out, greedy White planters importing CHEAP (Asiatic) labor to work the plantations&hellip; but WHY, WHY are White nations including the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia so anxious to commit what amounts to cultural suicide?</p>

			<p>For those of you who think we ought to dump Hawaii, remember that a Russian professor predicts this and that China and Russia would love to make it their military base.  It would sever the native right, however - The Russians and Chinese would simply imprison them all on the smallest island and wait for them to die off completely - if not flat out deport them to Siberia, etc.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the hotel bums wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it. What&rsquo;s a &#8220;hotel bum?&#8221; It&rsquo;s a &#8220;local&#8221; who has no job, no money, no skills, and no ability to do anything except be a professional Hawaiian. They pick up a White tourist girl and convince her to take them to dinner, sleep with them, ad basically support these bums until it&rsquo;s time for the tourist girl to go home. Then they find another one. And this is from personal first hand observation of one of them at work, trying to pick up my female aircraft commander while I was in USAF. She said it wasn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;d had to tell one of them to &#8220;stick it, bra.&#8221;</p>

A retired Green Beret said he couldn&rsquo;t even imagine taking a drubbing like that.  Of course, I also had legal problems later on, and I drink more than my wife and mother like, but that&rsquo;s par for the course.</p>
