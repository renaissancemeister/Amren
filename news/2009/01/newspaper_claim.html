<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-odd/20090123/ODD.Goat.Thief/">Newspaper Claims Car Thief Transformed Into a Goat</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Nigeria&rsquo;s biggest daily newspapers reported that police implicated a goat in an attempted automobile theft. In a front-page article on Friday, the Vanguard newspaper said that two men tried to steal a Mazda car two days earlier in Kwara State, with one suspect transforming himself into a goat as vigilantes cornered him.</p>
<p>The paper quoted police spokesman Tunde Mohammed as saying that while one suspect escaped, the other transformed into a goat as he was about to be apprehended.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that police paraded the goat before journalists, and published a picture of the animal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Belief in black magic is widespread in Nigeria, particularly in far-flung rural areas.<br>

			<p>&#8220;The newspaper reported that police paraded the goat before journalists, and published a picture of the animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if they realize the importance of getting a good profile shot as well as a frontal for their federal &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; posters, when the perp hasn&rsquo;t been caught yet.</p>

			<p>May we assume that the shape shifting perpetrator turned into a WHITE goat?</p>

			<p>My 5th level wizard did the same thing in a recent Dragon and Dungens campaign. Nigeria must a one big D&D; campaign.</p>

			<p>I once worked alonsgide a very nice black woman from Trinidad-Tobago. She told me that in her homeland some of the men had powers of black magic and could transform into insects.</p>
<p>She told me the women in her village would become upset if they were undressing inside their homes and they saw an insect or bird land on the window sill because they feared it might be a local peeping tom. </p>

			<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Transform yourself into a goat and that&rsquo;s a dead giveaway.  He chose the wrong animal.  Must have been rushed&hellip;with the police closing in and all&hellip;</p>

			<p>There are only two classes of person in a rational world he could ever apparently believe it is possible for human being to transmogrify into a goat:<br>
1/. Children under the age of five years old.<br>
2/. Paranoid schizophrenics.</p>
<p>I leave it to the reader&rsquo;s judgement under which category part of Nigeria&rsquo;s non-infant population must lie in.</p>

			<p>I just wonder who went bleating to the police and turned-in the hircine be-hoofed defendent?<br>
Whethet to charge the said young buck as a domestic quadruped or as a human, the Nigerians must really be on the horns of a dilemma.<br>
Perhaps it behoofs us more not mock the capricious nature of Nigerian justice.</p>

			<p>If that goat is later eaten by someone (as it no doubt would be, sine I doubt that any goats in Nigeria die natural deaths), would that person be charged with cannibalism?</p>
<p>I wonder if Nigerian law is sophisticated enough to handle these fine points?     Just wondering.</p>

			<p>Heck, that&rsquo;s nothing.  We&rsquo;ve just witnessed an entire generation of CEOs and financiers turn themselves into goats here in America.  And they will never be able to turn themselves back into humans.</p>
