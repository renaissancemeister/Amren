			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, says migrants have failed to integrate into British society over the past 40 years</p>
<p>Immigrants to Britain in the past five decades have been treated like hotel guests who &#8216;do not belong&rsquo;, the Archbishop of York said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr John Sentamu said the failure of migrants to integrate had contributed to the collapse of a common British culture and the lack of a national sense of direction.</p>
<p>He called for recognition of the Christian heritage which used to bind the nation together and for a revival of the civic values once represented by myriad local clubs, churches and trade unions.</p>
<p>The Archbishop&rsquo;s powerful attack on uncontrolled immigration and on the Left-wing interpretation of multiculturalism that encourages migrants to ignore traditional British values, was made in a speech to Gordon Brown&rsquo;s think tank, the Smith Institute.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu, a trustee of the Institute, has previously criticised multiculturalism and official neglect of the importance of Christian thinking and history.</p>
<p>But yesterday&rsquo;s speech was the first admission from a senior Church of England figure that large-scale immigration has brought serious problems as well as benefits.</p>
<p>Ugandan-born Dr Sentamu, who came to Britain in the 1970s, said it was important to remember that Britain had always provided refuge for economic migrants.</p>
<p>He said 250,000 Jewish people had come before the First World War, and had integrated and been accepted.</p>
<p>&#8216;What happened after the Second World War was a different phenomenon,&rsquo; Dr Sentamu continued.</p>
<p>&#8216;For the first time, significant numbers of immigrants from a non Judaeo-Christian background settled in the UK.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He referred to the view of Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks that until the 1950s immigrants were like guests in a country house, who were expected to assimilate British values and to belong to the existing society.</p>
<p>But with the decline of empire and the growth of Commonwealth immigration, the pattern had become more like a hotel.</p>
<p>&#8216;Guests are entitled to stay if they can pay their way and receive basic services in return for their payment,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;But they are guests  &mdash;  they do not belong. In the same way, migrants to Britain from the 1960s onwards have made their home with their cultural rights protected under legislation framed under a multicultural perspective.</p>
<p>&#8216;Consequently, any sense of a shared common culture is eroded, risking increasing segregation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop, who is second in the hierarchy of the Church of England, was speaking at a time when Mr Brown and his ministers have been increasingly prepared to acknowledge problems linked to immigration.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu praised Mr Brown&rsquo;s view of Britishness but warned that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s vision &#8216;flounders if it does not allow for participation, involvement and commitment from individuals and communities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He also blamed leaders of the Church of England for failing to speak out over the future of the nation as well as ignoring &#8216;the voiceless and the unheard in the market square&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu said that since 2001 there had been no fewer than five &#8216;major government reports on social cohesion&rsquo; all attempting to &#8216;address the problems of a multicultural approach&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But few aims had been achieved. This was, Dr Sentamu said, because the Government has been wedded to central control and had been reluctant to see local communities have power.</p>
<p>And, he said, &#8216;there has also been a reluctance to acknowledge the strong Judaeo-Christian heritage which has shaped our language, our laws, our education and our hard-won civil rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop lamented the collapse of the vision of Britain developed in the 1940s that underpinned the creation of the welfare state.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is a tragedy to me that we have increasingly lost this big vision,&rsquo; Dr Sentamu said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Memory loss has made Britain sleepwalk on streets supposedly paved with gold but sadly littered with promissory notes whose cash value is the credit crunch and the economic downturn as well as becoming a country that is not at ease with itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Communities Secretary Hazel Blears has said since the New Year that many poorer white people feel betrayed and ignored by authorities and that they fear losing out in the share-out of public benefits. She has also admitted that Labour allowed a &#8216;free-for-all&rsquo; in immigration since it took power in 1997.</p>

			<p>&#8220;treated like hotel guests who do not belong&#8221; Good analogy! Reminds me when I worked at Applebee`s. We could be cautioned for not refering to patrons as &#8220;guests&#8221;. I persisted in using the term customers, to the point of almost being fired by the GM for not towing the ideological line. I finally told him, &#8220;they are not my friends, not here at my invitaion and are directing me like you would an employee.&#8221; Seems to be the case here. In case people get the wrong idea that I was not a crackerjack bartender, I also quickly acknowledged that they were MORE important than guests, spending money with us they could elsewhere. Not so much the case with Britian`s guests&hellip;</p>

			<p>Here is my interpretation of what this guy is saying:</p>
<p>John Semantu is worried that there won&rsquo;t be enough &#8216;hideous&rsquo; White people around shortly to create those lovely White societies that the few higher IQ blacks love to live in.</p>
<p>So please, lets get rid of all these other races who are fleecing Britain so the White British can get back to doing what they should. I.E. worshiping and supporting black africans.</p>

			<p>Note that with each passing month now more downbeat assessments and hand wringing will become more numerous, not only in the UK and the rest of Europe, but in the US as well, as they slowly are forced to admit they are having huge problems with their diversity utopia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad admission on their part that they&rsquo;re sorely lacking in any kind of intelligent foresight and their gleeful pursuit of multicultural society was a naive dream of fools.<br>

			<p>Good thing the archbishop is black - we know what would happen if a white person stood up and said the same things. The loss of a common culture and unifying threads was spelled out in Professor Putnam&rsquo;s research on the corrosive effects of ethnic and cultural diversity, about how we retreat from the world and spend more time watching television.</p>

			<p>As whites become more cognizant of the deceit of multiculturalism, a new intellectual movement is growing to head off the threat of white awareness. </p>
<p>Where multiculturalism advocated many races harmoniously living together, the new movement, which has yet to be given a formal name, seeks to slip race under the carpet, as if no one will notice.</p>
<p>Call them the first advocates of post-racialism.<br>

<p>In other words, Brown&rsquo;s vision flounders if Brown doesn&rsquo;t <b>order</b> the promotion of non-whites across the political, judical and social spectrums to facilitate the transference of Britain, its indigenous people and its resources into the hands of us non-whites.</p>
<p>On careful analysis of Marxist propaganda speak, it&rsquo;s surprising what subtle gems of Marxist brainwashing and deception techniques float to the surface!!!!!<br>

			<p>Dr. Sentamu is a good man to care about native Brits.  Apparently only a non-White is allowed to defend White culture.  If a White Brit said these same words, he would be persecuted by the media, forced to pay a large fine, and then serve time in jail.   </p>
<p>For high I.Q. Blacks like Dr. Sentamu, his ideal Britain is probably one where Whites continue to be the majority race and continue to create a First World, sophisticated country, but also a place where the native Brits are generous enough to let in a few quality non-Whites here and there (like him).  But for how many decades can a White country stay majority White if even 5% of its population is non-White?  </p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what the solution is anymore.  Britain&rsquo;s power brokers have worked behind the scenes for at least 40 years to replace the native Anglo-Saxon-Celtic people with aliens.  Ringing the alarm bell at the 11th hour, while still commendable and brave, is rather too late.</p>

			<p>       Those 250,000 Jews: anyone really think that they assimil-ated? No, me neither. They undoubtedly have played a huge role in<br>
the demoralization of Britain.</p>

			<p>It would be a mistake to gloss Dr Sentamu&rsquo;s comments as some kind of veiled Marxism demanding transfer of a white culture to non-whites, as A Swain does. There are more perceptive comments from the next poster, &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;. </p>
<p>Sentamu is actually a good man, and along with another non-white, Michael Nazir-Ali (the present Bishop of Rochester), would make a very fine Archbishop of Canterbury. These two men are far more conservative culturally and morally than any of their white colleagues. Sentamu may be a black African himself, but he is squarely on the side of white European civilisation. </p>

<p>The BNP has been taken to court and won. The establishment parties have taken their best shot. It&rsquo;s not to late, consider joining or contributing to the BNP. That&rsquo;s the solution. </p>
<p>It is my sincere belief that if &#8220;we&#8221;, around the globe, support the BNP today we will all be able to build Nationalistic parties in our countries in the future. We should see ourselves as one global Nationalist movement. Consider becoming a overseas member of the BNP if your not a British citizen.     </p>

			<p>Dave at 8:46 AM is right.  We AmRen readers who care about the native British people should support the BNP as best we can.  There is always hope that circumstances there will improve.</p>
<p>Why is EVERY other racial group allowed to have organizations that stand up for them but Whites are condemned as racists if we try to do the same?  I wish we Americans were so fortunate as to have an American equivalent to the BNP looking out for us in Congress.  Maybe someday we will.</p>

			<p>This guy&rsquo;s homeland is one of the most racist societies in the world. Uganda expelled thousands of Asians in the 1970s who had lived there longer than he or his black African brothers have lived in the UK. He has some nerve living in the UK and wanting to belong to British society.</p>

			<p>Eric the Red is about as far off-beam as you can possibly get.</p>
<p>Of all the immigrants to Britain the Jews are among the best-integrated and most culturally assimilated. Incidentally, I write not as a Jew, but as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast the Jews with the Muslims!</p>

<p>I agree with your take on the morality point.  </p>
<p>However, Sentamu is not on the side of European civilisation nor the rights of indigenous white peoples to rule their own homelands even though he did utter some platitude about the English being allowed to practice their own culture and celebrate their heritage and express national pride in their own homeland, etc.  That is not the same as saying whites should always be the sole masters of their own houses (lands) though.</p>
<p>Like Tutu, he&rsquo;s of Marxist persuasion as all African notables are.  Look up his profile on the wider internet.</p>
<p>At his inauguration, he turned this most solemn of occasions into an African tribal celebration, replete with African dancers in leopard skins, body paint and bongo drums up and down the isles of the church. Even today, his religious garb is designed along African lines as can also be gleaned from their gaudy colour scheme.</p>
<p>He may be a cut above the average among his Ugandan brothers, but he was appointed as a token to fulfil Affirmative Action legislation which is racial discrimination against indigenous Britons in their own ancestral homelands, in case you&rsquo;ve forgotten.  Does Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda or any other African state permit the opposite scenario.  No, they most certainly do not! </p>
<p>Furthermore, are we to believe there is no other indigenous white man in Britain capable of performing the role of Archbishop of York?</p>
<p>As for the position of Archbishop of Cantebury, yes either of the two non-white clerics, ie, Sentamu and Michael Ali of Rochester would be vast improvements on the present incumbent, but that&rsquo;s hardly the point, is it?</p>
<p>Both these non-white gentlemen should be back in their own lands of origin administering to their own racial brethren, not lording it over the spiritual affairs of indigenous white Britons in their own ancestral homelands.<br>

			<p>Whites owe blacks nothing and we have already given them far more than they deserve.  We must stop pretending we can educate and civilize them and simply send them back to Africa.  If they believe they are our equals then let them prove it in their ancestral homelands&hellip;   <br>
