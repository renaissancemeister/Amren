<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Associated Press noticed liberal Rev. Joseph Lowery&rsquo;s prayer raised eyebrows {snip}. That divisive note drew this headline: &#8220;Lowery gives sole inaugural note of racial caution.&#8221; The entire dispatch was brief: <blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>After the first black president had been sworn in, Rev. Joseph Lowery ended his benediction with a rhyme familiar to black churchgoers:</p>
<p>&#8220;We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back, when brown can stick around .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was laughter from the enormous crowd. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right. That all those who do justice and love mercy say Amen.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>I thought it was a bizzare benediction.  <br/>
It was a bizarre rhyme.  Lowery, and the other civil right hucksters are fighting phantom battles.</p>
<p>What a difference between the way the mainstream television media covered it, and the internet chats boards covered it.  Needless to say television and other mainstream media are  worthless.</p>

			<p>Blacks have no business trying to compete in an advanced society, because they have neither the intelligence nor the ability.  That they have one who is half-white and competent who made the office of president has more to do with white charity than it does with black ability, however, because the man is nothing exceptional, measured by the standard applied to whites.</p>
<p>Much has been given to the black whiners, yet they continue to insult, denigrate and show open hostility to all whites.  Such ingratitude is typical of their primitive natures.</p>
<p>That this black cry baby chose to pretend the whole country is at the mercy of white oppression and racism is beyond despicable.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I realize he&rsquo;s too ignorant to know better, but I wonder what he would think if he were aware of what is happening in the real world and recognize that the brown, red and yellow have more disguist for him than whites?  But he&rsquo;s so ignorant he&rsquo;d probably still want to include them all under the same umbrella.</p>
<p>And did the whites there all say &#8220;Amen?&#8221;  Surely not.  No fool would agree like that after being insulted as they were, would they?  Are there really whites that are such collosal fools?</p>

			<p> Naturally the AP with its pro-Obama, pro-liberal bias would note approvingly Lowery&rsquo;s totally inappropriate comments. It&rsquo;s one thing to say what he said in a sermon on a black church where everyone is agreed on the &#8220;we been mistreated&#8221; mantra. It&rsquo;s yet another to say it during a widely covered speech during the inauguration of a president.</p>
<p> The AP can call Lowery&rsquo;s doggerel &#8220;humorous&#8221; if it wants to. To me his words are just another example of how blacks like to feel sorry for themselves, and blame &#8220;Whitey&#8221; for all their shortcomings.</p>

<p>This Christian wallowing-in-sin stuff can be easily turned against the people who believe in it the most  &mdash;  Whites. And they will eat it up. Such great sinners, in need of saving (shows how righteous they are)! Even if they are &#8220;post-Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallow, wallow, wallow!</p>
<p>Has any White (or any race) Christian minister or spokesman  taken the good &#8220;Reverend&#8221; to task for these incredibly stupid <br/>
and offensive remarks?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>Fie! Ptui! </p>

<p>Pagan response to the good &#8220;Reverend&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;We embraced what was right long before we uplifted your people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I read this earlier today on the Drudge Report. I read it to several friends. We were all outraged that someone could be this blatantly racist towards whites without raising a fight. </p>
<p>How much longer are we going to take this kind of insult?</p>
<p>I grow more and more race aware as the days go by. I am fed up with politically correct people rubbing this sort of thing in my face. The only way we could possibly be friends with most blacks is to work our self to death while giving them everything we have. Even if I have to quit my good paying job, I will not contribute more to this government. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how enough is never enough.  Whites are:<br/>
Discriminated against by affirmative action<br/>
Forced to tolerate intolerable work conditions as evidenced by many articles in AmRen<br/>
Discriminated against in major sports in this country<br/>
Beaten<br/>
Killed<br/>
Raped<br/>
etc.</p>
<p>-And these people still want &#8220;their rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will Whites embrace what is right.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>Apparently there is a double standard allowing black people to say anything they want against whites while whites have to walk on egg shells or risk being called a racist.</p>
<p>Lowery&rsquo;s so-called benediction, in the period of &#8220;can&rsquo;t we all get along&#8221; took a very cheap shot at whites.<br/>
Whites played a very important role in electing Obama and now<br/>
are going to be insulted as racists in a s0-called  &#8220;benediction&#8221; on the very first day of the new black presidency.<br/>
Apparently this is a big joke and even Obama thought it was funny. <br/>
Believe me, this was very stupid and is getting us off to a bad start. I, for one, am insulted at this double standard.<br/>

			<p>I hope lots of white Americans heard that &#8220;whites embrace what&rsquo;s right&#8221;. It was obnoxious obviously. I think Obama will be the last black and non white president for a very long time. His election is a fluke, he&rsquo;s half white and half immigrant black. </p>

			<p>Man, blacks are stuck in some kind of time warp. They&rsquo;ve been trotting out the same old tired cliches for decades now and they still think they&rsquo;re actually talking about the real world when they talk about &#8220;blacks sitting in back&#8221; and all that stuff. I can&rsquo;t begin to describe how much this kind of rhetoric bores me. I do agree with him about one thing, though. I&rsquo;m also hoping that the time will come when &#8220;whites will do right,&#8221; but I don&rsquo;t think the right thing in this case is what Lowery&rsquo;s got in mind. </p>

<p>This is a statement of UNBELIEVABLE ARROGANCE. Of course,it is the reverend and his ilk, who will tell folks when that day of &#8220;white enlightenment&#8221; has finally come. If you&rsquo;re white, don&rsquo;t hold your breath. The notion of some mere human being,even a &#8220;reverend&#8221;, deciding that they will be the absolute arbiter in deciding if someone else&rsquo;s behavior is righteous enough to meet some standard of theirs, is absurd, pretentious and WRONG  &mdash;   ESPECIALLY so from a Christian standpoint. </p>

			<p>This should surprise no one. Those who insist that Obama&rsquo;s presidency promises to usher in a new post-racial era free of the incessant grievance mongering that society has come to expect from black interest groups are self-delusional.  </p>
<p>Grievance politics are the life blood of too many. Black leftists will be warning White America at every turn not to get too comfortable with the notion that &#8220;racism&#8221; is behind us. </p>

			<p>This is a perfect sum up of the entire Obama campaign and inagural tone; stereotypes and rap type rhymes.  Let&rsquo;s see is making vague gradiose speeches, using rhetoric to restrain criticism, and socializing capitalism will make him a great president.  Heck, let&rsquo;s see if it will even allow him to &#8220;be&#8221; a president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr King and a great cloud of witnesses are rejoicing in Heaven,&#8221; the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Warren said.</p>

<p>And if the white man ever really embraced what was right, that is right for him and his own, what then Comrade Lowery?</p>
<p>He would certainly not see the election of a General Secretary Obama; nor, would he tolerate the impertinencies of swarms black &#8220;ministers&#8221; slandering him from their pulpits.</p>

			<p>I read the full transcript of that distasteful, tacky and tasteless speech and it almost made me sick. How nice to know that my ancestors had not been doing what is &#8220;right&#8221; down through the ages. All I see is a long litany of complaint and accusation and finger-pointing. Of all the races mentioned, black, brown, yellow and red, ONLY THE WHITE IS NOT DOING WHAT IS RIGHT! Did everyone catch that? All the other races are victims while the white is the villain! </p>
<p>This in spite of the fact that Obama was supposed to be the Great Reconciliator! No thanks to whites for voting him in, just accusations and insults. </p>
<p>Notice also that everything is in the future. The &#8220;future&#8221; has not arrived yet; no, that is always &#8220;someday.&#8221; SOMEDAY, black, brown, yellow and red will not be oppressed and put down by the evil white man! Ant this is at Obama&rsquo;s inauguration! Is any further evidence needed that whites will NEVER stop being the &#8220;oppressors?&#8221;</p>

what is right?&#8221;  Doesn&rsquo;t Rev. Lowery understand that without a large number of white voters Obama wouldn&rsquo;t even be President now? This just goes to show that even when whites do what they think will give them redemption from racism, they&rsquo;re still considered wrong by blacks like Lowery. With blacks you just can&rsquo;t win, so don&rsquo;t even bother playing their games. </p>

It was, after all, the clueless whites who put him over the edge and gave him the presidency.  But, those whites probably agree with the statement that whites need to do what is right.  What is wrong with those people?  Do they have a brain disfunction?  Seriously, there must be something wrong with a people who despise their own people!!!  Please, Mr. Taylor, address this issue in detail.  Most of us out here are so disheartened, dispirited, depressed, and just down and out over all of this we don&rsquo;t know where to turn, what to think, how to get through this without losing our minds.  Please give us direction, guidance, point us in a direction where we can at least understand why this horrible thing is happening!  Help.</p>

			<p>Out and out anti-white racism, reinforcing the age-old truth that whites are the ONLY group which can be targeted. Imagine if a white equivalent had spoken a similar ditty, but invoked blacks to &#8220;embrace what is right&#8221;. Rioting would have promptly ensued.</p>
<p>I wathched the entire inauguration ceremony on BBC TV. If I hadn&rsquo;t known that it was the United States, I would have believed that I was watching the end of white rule in some 98 per cent black African country. Thay was the tone of the event and particularly of the BBC&rsquo;s neo-Marxist spin.   </p>

			<p>So everybody gets their piece of the racial spoils except Whites   &mdash;   who must simply &#8220;embrace&#8221; it all and shut up.  How much plainer can it be made?  And still the crowds of White liberals clap and cheer.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here is surprised at this stuff. What I thought was interesting was the stock market didn&rsquo;t/couldn&rsquo;t rig the market for the day to show how happy the investers were that Obama was being sworn in. What&rsquo;s more important, the words of a fool, or the actions of the market? I&rsquo;d say, most defintely the latter.</p>

I remember hearing the story of a man who was asked to say a prayer at a luncheon. He began to pray in a very low voice and someone shouted &#8220;speak up, I can&rsquo;t hear you!&#8221; The man stopped his prayer and said - &#8220;I&rsquo;m not talking to you!&#8221;<br/>

When our oldest came home and asked what the minister meant by &#8216;white doing what&rsquo;s right&rsquo;, I didn&rsquo;t know what she meant, so I grabbed my local afternoon newspaper, which had reprinted the benediction in full.  I was astounded!  I told her it sounded like something spoken in black churches during the Civil War.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see if the MSM even questions this man about his outrageous remark.  In a way I&rsquo;m glad our kids saw this; it sparked a lively discussion at our dinner table.  No white guilt in our family!</p>

The focus is on them for once.  It seems that Obama cannot even be in office more than a few minutes and he trips over his adoring black supporters.  This is only going to get better.  </p>

			<p>I was absolutely appalled by &#8220;Reverand&#8221; Lowery&rsquo;s race-based benediction!</p>
<p>After all of Obama&rsquo;s flowery campaign speeches about &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; and a new chapter of &#8220;unity&#8221;&hellip;  For all of his sweet talk of a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; society&hellip;  Then to witness this so-called prayer at the very end of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;world-celebrated&#8221; inauguration ceremony&hellip;  The final punch line said it all.  What a way to end Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;historic&#8221; presidential inauguration.  Talk about ending this &#8220;great step for humanity&#8221; on such a flat, sour and bitter note.</p>
<p>To think that millions of white suckers in this country voted for Barack Hussein Obama, now our first African-American president; and this is the thanks they get?</p>
<p>This racist benediction was a direct slap in the face to all white men, women and children; not only here in America, but throughout the world; and I, for one, was truly disgusted.  Of course, I was not surprised.  I&rsquo;ve known in my heart all along that Barack Obama is nothing but an International Globalist&hellip;  An Anti-American, Anti-White &#8220;Citizen of the World&#8221; but even he should have known better&hellip;</p>
<p>At least, the whole world witnessed this despicable act; so maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;ll wake up a few more of our people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, so much for &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>I am not in favor of exchanging on form of superstition for another.  However, yesterdays many Christian prayers is topped off by &#8220;Rev&#8221; Lowrey because it began to expose the very racist nature of the entire Obama campaign that used that same mechanism contained in Christian &#8220;logic&#8221; to undo - no, to dare anyone to criticze Obama&rsquo;s qualifications for the presidency.  It turned into a campaign whose subtle message was &#8220;Elect a Black Man and gain absolution.  Oppose it and be labelled a racist.&#8221;</p>

Now, maybe some can get past their racial guilt stuff( while running back to their segregated neighborhoods)and be open to a REAL Republican nominee if OB bombs out. These &#8220;ministers&#8221; are a joke, anyway. I have a friend of mine do it as a goof- to show how easy you can get a certificate calling u minister. Think he filled out some forms, sent some money to a place in Vegas- and boom, it said he is now a minister of a non-denominational church. Just showing what a scam all of these guys are- lowery, Sharpton, Jerkson, and countless others. How many TRUE people of God do sessions on division and demonizing one group? Anyway, as usual, non-whites have a racket. They keep coming here, have kids, take advantage of what whites create, take advantage of white guilt.. and now, a half black guy is in. It is good to be smacked around once in a while. Bush was our smack and Obama is the the result. Vote in 2010.</p>

It was, after all, the clueless whites who put him over the edge and gave him the presidency. But, those whites probably agree with the statement that whites need to do what is right. What is wrong with those people? Do they have a brain disfunction? Seriously, there must be something wrong with a people who despise their own people!!! Please, Mr. Taylor, address this issue in detail. Most of us out here are so disheartened, dispirited, depressed, and just down and out over all of this we don&rsquo;t know where to turn, what to think, how to get through this without losing our minds.

To answer your question, we as white people need a nation unto ourselves, no other peoples among to cause disharmony and become contentions. One people, one race and one language, this will insure no racial problems. There will be problems, but not have a racial nature. <br/>
The founding Fathers neglected to address the slave situation in 1800 as should have by freeing them and providing repatriation to Africa with no remaining in this country. Then tell the rich slave owners (who were about 2%) to hire white people to do the work.<br/>
The bitterness in them will always be in their souls and constantly fed by white communists who control them, in spite of the fact of  2% of the white population owned slaves.<br/>

<p>Also, I agree with the commenter that Christianity is part of the problem here.  Turn the other cheek, forgive your enemies, is nice when there is some kind of common ground (racial, family, ethnicity) to enable estranged friends to reconcile.  </p>
<p>But implacable enemies who are genetically unlike you, whose thought processes are utterly alien, will simply use your defenselessness to obliterate you.  </p>

Only the most craven white &#8220;liberal&#8221; still has the warm fuzzy glow - which emanates deep from the bowels of their pathetic self-loathing - about an Obama Presidency after that ridiculous, pretentious and semi-literate &#8220;Benediction.&#8221;<br/>
Even IF White were guilty, and we are NOT!, you would think a man who has been following Jesus around all of his life would do the two most important things Jesus taught, ie; Make your life a Practice of Christs teachings, and Transcend Resentment!<br/>
It is THIS that Jesus has in common with the Bhudda, and any great Spiritual teacher worthy of the distinction.<br/>
It wasn&rsquo;t a benediction, it was flatulence. They just called it a benediction.  Oh, and how about Mr. Class <a href="../../../../nphotos/slideshow/photo/090120/ids_photos_ts/r2310073519.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/photo/090120/ids_photos_ts/r2310073519.jpg/</a><br/>

			<p>Communism works by the ruling class (Globalists) inciting the lower class Then he ended his prayer with, &ldquo;Lord, in the memory of all the saints who from their labors rest, and in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get back, when brown can stick around – when yellow will be mellow – when the red man can get ahead, man – and when white will embrace what is right.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Obama reacted to the benediction with a smile.</p>

<p>Right. But the INSANITY of this was that this fool made these remarks at an &#8220;Historic&#8221; ocassion.  &#8220;Historic&#8221; because the President being sworn in was BLACK! He has time to smirk at the &#8220;Minister&rsquo;s&#8221; remarks, but no time for any gratitude, of course.</p>
<p>This can only be refered to for what it is, Radical Ingratitude.<br/>
Talk about the compulsion to repeat.  Repeating the same complaints, like the chattering of an idiot, only less interesting, and far more dangerous.<br/>
Between these stupid comments and the response, and Rhambo&rsquo;s adolescent gesture (have you seen the photo?) I had, for the very last time, all of my worst nightmares confirmed and thought I was in Grade School in the mid-70&rsquo;s (my class was 60% Black).<br/>
There are probably more than a few folks like me here in AR Land and we have seen this coming since childhood, and now, it&rsquo;s here.</p>

			<p>As I said before, we are inching towards being no better than any of the African countries under black rule.  Obama may have surrounded himself with a white cabinet but their previous employer, Bill Clinton, actually said that he couldn&rsquo;t wait until the country was less white.</p>

			<p>Watch now how BHO is attempting to coherse all Americans to support him.  He is unleashing his storm troopers on the internet.  The mechanism is a national version of the old &#8220;You won&rsquo;t support me &#8216;cause you&rsquo;re predge&hellip;&#8221; that so many Blacks have used to get White women to date them.  The hope is - I believe, to make desenters feel isolanted and attach an automatic label of &#8220;racist.&#8221;  I have to hand it to him for his amazing attempt at Orwellian thought control via the media and the internet.  I would never have thought anyone would actually want to be &#8220;Big Brother.&#8221;  Now, we have &#8220;Big Black Brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing ever happens exactly the way you expect it.</p>

			<p>When I heard the invocation I had a fit. This was a presidential inauguration, something a bit more majestic was called for. Instead we are allowing ourselves to be brought down to street level jive talking rhymes when installing our president. </p>

			<p><em>&ldquo;It was a bizarre rhyme&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lowery&rsquo;s rhyme was a rhyme from my parent&rsquo;s and grandparents generation. Cut him some slack his was comments were from a different generational perspective.</p>

Thank you African American Man for weighing-in on this issue. I&rsquo;m fully prepared to cut Lowery all the slack he needs if African Americans will stop blaming people of my race and generation for slavery, for lack of employment opportunities, for lack of educational opportunities, etc. The self-perceived problems of the black race didn&rsquo;t start during the time of my antecedents, but in the consciousness of the race at large. As one AmRen contributor so eloquently put it: &#8220;my race is my nation.&#8221; <br/>

			<p>I can honestly say after 38 years of living, loving and fighting for America and its rights and freedoms I am now truly ashamed of America. How did we let it get to this point where we allowed the liberals who have never picked up a gun or put on a badge to defend our country or its citizens. We need to prepare ourselves to be openly mocked, ridiculed and even persecuted for our white skin, our white heritage, and our white beliefs. The blacks will not be happy until they are able to put the whites into slavery for 100 years.</p>

			<p>since the 1960&rsquo;s millions &amp; millions of dollars have been spent on the blacks, but they don&rsquo;t think its enough.  There is no other country in the world that has been so good to black people as the USA.  </p>

			<p>Well, if the anti-whites succeed in subjugating the white race their usurped civilization will crumble. <br/>
History has shown us that non-whites just can not build and maintain an advanced civilization.</p>
