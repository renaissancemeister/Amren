<h1>Black Males Often Struggle to Stay Ahead</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keila Torres, Connecticut Post (Bridgeport), January 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But another issue in the African-American community also dominated the headlines in the last year, mentioned numerous times on the campaign trail by Obama himself &mdash; most notably his Father&rsquo;s Day speech before a predominantly black crowd at the Apostolic Church of God on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is,&#8221; Obama said. But, &#8220;too many fathers also are missing &mdash; missing from too many lives and too many homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments made some people in the African-American community angry, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was notoriously caught on Fox News whispering crude remarks under his breath about Obama.</p>
<p>Others in the black community, however, applauded Obama&rsquo;s decision to discuss the issue on the campaign trail. Although others had spoken on the issue before him &mdash; like actor/comedian Bill Cosby, who in a recent Hartford appearance again addressed the subject in a speech before the Fatherhood Task Force established by House Speaker James A. Amann &mdash; Obama drew attention to the problem as never before.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama was right in declaring that many black men shy away from their responsibilities, said Laurayne Farrar-James, a former Bridgeport teacher and community activist. &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking at a very serious dilemma. I see it across the board; it&rsquo;s just people of color have a greater portion of the burden to carry,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Last hired, first fired&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>There are many complex reasons why the black community, in particular, finds themselves affected by this issue, said Craig Kelly, president of the Greater Bridgeport NAACP. &#8220;We burn the candle at both ends. At one end is the system and at the other end we are burning the candle ourselves&#8221; with negative behavior, he said.</p>
<p>The current economic meltdown, for instance, is exacerbating an issue that many black men have always dealt with: a lack of jobs and the threat of losing a job.</p>
<p>Black men are &#8220;still the last hired and the first fired,&#8221; said Lt. Dave Daniels, who works in the Bridgeport Police Department and is director of the annual Officer Friendly Drug Free Basketball camp. &#8220;They are not out there making money like the status quo. I think that plays a big role in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the advances society has made and the impact of Obama&rsquo;s election, many men are still plagued by racism, said Kelly. &#8220;Society makes it difficult for him [a black man] to be a breadwinner. Certainly racism plays a role in this aspect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Black men are told we are part of American society and then we are slammed.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, if a &#8220;black male encounters a police officer he is more likely to go to jail than their white counterparts,&#8221; Daniels said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The effect of not having a father figure in a child&rsquo;s life can have a profound negative effect, Tisdale said. &#8220;Children from single-parent households are usually underdeveloped,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Children never get the opportunity to experience the support of having a male in the household.&#8221;</p>
<p>For children in the area, the issue is worsened by the lack of black men in the education system, said Farrar-James. &#8220;There are 365 days in the year and 181 of those days young people spend in school,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our system of education plays a major part in the development of our children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young black men are suffering because of the &#8220;absence of having someone that looks like him, strong black males they can relate to and identify with,&#8221; said Kelly.</p>
<p>In many instances, young men who grow up without a father &#8220;mimic and carry out the same characteristics as their father&#8221; by walking away from their own offspring, Kelly said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s election could serve as a catalyst to motivate the nation to step forward &mdash; like they did on Election Day &mdash; and find a way to end this cycle of fatherlessness, Kelly said. &#8220;Clearly with Obama being a president, being a family man, having values that says a lot. We have not had a model to emulate in a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the responsibility of this great task should not rest solely on a family&rsquo;s shoulders, Daniels said. &#8220;I try to be the kind of police officer that is approachable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to be somebody&rsquo;s father to tell them to be in school, go to college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to, as black men, step up to the plate and do positive things to build up the black family,&#8221; said Meekins.</p>
<p>Communities also need to develop and support programs that teach children and young adults to &#8220;develop a sense of cultural self-esteem,&#8221; Kelly said. There also need to be programs specifically tailored for teen and new fathers.</p>
<p>The education system should also play a part in solving the issue of absent fathers, Farrar-James said. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to move to the point where Obama is the rule, not the exception,&#8221; Kelly said.<br>

		<p>A black St. Louis talk radio host, Onion Horton, once implored black men to go back home to their women and children.  A black man caller on the day he said it asked the host, &#8220;which woman should I go back to?  And should I kick out her kids that aren&rsquo;t by me?&#8221;</p>

Besides providing a nice example of pronoun misreference, this Daniels guy misses the point: A black male who encounters a police officer is more likely to act like a belligerant antisocial menace who BELONGS in jail than his&hellip; HIS white counterparts.</p>

		<p>As one might expect, this article is nothing but the usual insipid soup of cliches and platitudes. I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;m not the only one who suspects that this newspaper just runs a standard-issue-to-MSM computer program which &#8220;writes&#8221; this stuff  &mdash;  no thinking required! </p>
<p>(I also note that the Connecticut Post&rsquo;s writer here is one &#8220;Keila Torres&#8221;  &mdash;  now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a fine old New England name.)</p>
<p>This seemed especially clueless:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s election could serve as a catalyst to motivate the nation to step forward &mdash; like they did on Election Day &mdash; and find a way to end this cycle of fatherlessness, Kelly said.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  blissfully ignorant of the fact that the &#8220;nation&#8221; (actually the usual lefty do-gooder managerial class, not me!) <i>created</i> &#8220;this cycle of fatherlessness&#8221; through their remarkably effective campaign of dysgenics via public funding.</p>
<p>If your goal is to create a dysfunctional underclass, nothing works like public subsidies that nurture dysfunction. Naturally Mr. Kelly will be forever shielded from this inconvenient truth. Way to go, Establishment do-gooders! </p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s election will no more change Black behavior than it will change the orbit of the moon.  That race has a genetic preference for high quantity, low quality, reproduction.  Black society has no real need for careful parenting, since all the typical African needs to know can be picked up by casual observation of others.  </p>

		<p>The content of this article is so full of whining that it seems like the author may have interviewed some middle school kids.  I&rsquo;m serious.  </p>
<p>The outright lying is no surprise, however, because most blacks, as I&rsquo;ve experienced them over the years, simply won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t tell the truth. Lying is a cultural trait with that race. But for this amazingly dishonest essay to be taken seriously is beyond belief.  </p>
<p>Blacks, as a group, reject education wholesale, and they willfully commit violent crimes as a preferred lifestyle - in and out of school. They produce children they neither care to raise or support. They have preferences, set-asides and entitlements specifically for them that would be the envy of any other civilized people. </p>
<p>They are the architects of their lives, and they continue to sabotage every chance or opportunity that comes their way.  The way they live and the condition of their communities are the result of their best cultural thinking.  </p>
<p>Still, with all the handouts, preferences, and tax money, there is never gratitude expressed by blacks, and they continue to fail; getting worse every generation while destroying communities in which they live. And they whine endlessly with chronic blaming and excuse-making. </p>
<p>Someone has to get the message across to blacks: &#8220;GROW UP, RAISE DECENT AND DISCIPLINED CHILDREN, STOP HURTING AND/OR PREYING ON OTHERS, PICK UP THE TRASH IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS, PAY YOUR DEBTS, STOP USING DRUGS, AND STOP WITH THE ADOLESCENT EXCUSES&#8221;!!!!</p>
<p>There is no place on the planet that blacks have lived peacefully, and where they have not exploited a country&rsquo;s welfare system. Once blacks grasp that insane construct they may get a clue, but their adolescent whining and criminal behavior is now a cultural trait.  </p>
<p>I see this was written in Connecticut.  Therein ends the surprise regarding this intellectually lazy and corrupt journalism piece.  In that state, blacks are pets to the liberals there, as opposed to people.      </p>

		<p>Why is that blacks need so much pampering from the whites to do the obvious?  How did the whites get so much ahead without any pampering from blacks or hispanics?  Why are the whites always accused of somehow taking something from the blacks and hispanics?  The blacks in Africa would still exist as the whites originally found them if the whites had never entered into Africa   &mdash;   living in grass huts absolutely no other types of buildings, etc.  The answer, of course, is that the genes determine the different racial groups which determine the attained level of civilization.  Currently, the Chinese, Japanese, and Russians are the ones calling it as it is.  It appears the rest of the Western world would rather see their civilization be destroyed than to aknowledge the inferior genes of certain racial groups   &mdash;  pure insanity.  People like Watson, William Shockley, Jensen all gets shot down for speaking the truth about the dangers of uncontrollable breeding of inferior genes.</p>

		<p>I doubt Obama is going to make the slightest difference. Obama was raised by his white grandparents, and his black African father was never in the picture. Since the 1960&rsquo;s, the black out of wedlock birthrate has continued to escalate steadily. It is not just a matter of teaching black men to be responsible parents, when black women willingly start having their children at a young age, and many are willing to have numerous more by different &#8220;BABY DADDIES&#8221;<br>
So long as many know that they will receive Government aid to help support their offspring, the trend will continue. And trust me, Obama will only see to it they get more now.</p>

		<p>What a sick joke this BHObama is.  Fact: Africans have NEVER formed nuclear family groups as are the norm in every civilized culture - not while in Africa, not in the Americas during the slavery era, and certainly not now. The &#8220;black family&#8221; is no less a fiction than &#8220;black culture&#8221; or &#8220;black achievement&#8221; - such fantasies exist only in the minds of the deluded.</p>

<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re right about that. </p>
<p>The black women I know, where I work, have all dispensed with their &#8220;man&#8221; once they&rsquo;ve had a kid or two and their maternal urge has been fulfilled.   Why put up with the lazy loafer, hanging around and mooching off you, once his job has been done?  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want him around, any more than he wants to be around. There are plenty more women out there that he can start with all over again.  A black male is just a drone; he serves his purpose and moves on.  </p>
<p>I agree with LegalEagle that the &#8220;black family&#8221; is a myth. <br>
As for the Obama family, well they&rsquo;re both at least half white. Maybe that explains their case.</p>

		<p>One useful recepie for a successful family is to marry your girlfriend and only THEN have children.  This isn&rsquo;t very complicated.  It doesn&rsquo;t always work, but it is a prerequisite.  </p>

<p>I am married to my daughter&rsquo;s mother, I intend to stay so, and I feel quite the opposite of the &#8220;typical black male&#8221; described above.  I once thought I was stubborn, but &#8220;stubborn&#8221; isn&rsquo;t fighting a felony case out for 17 months from behind bars.  Stubborn is four hours of sleep a night because your baby cries.</p>

		<p>If I were a business owner, the last people I&rsquo;d hire and the first ones I&rsquo;d fire would probably be those with the lowest IQs and weakest work ethic, regardless of skin color.  That Black men fit that unfortunate profile would not be my problem  &mdash;  especially if I&rsquo;m trying to stay in business.<br>

		<p> Any mystery why black males are such social losers when<br>
they worship this behavior -</p>

		<p>Since multiple fathers come into the lives of many Black women, confusion of daddies is the norm.  In just about every society that has to inure itself to such polygamous moorings, is it any wonder that there&rsquo;s an African proverb that says, &#8220;It takes a village to raise a child&#8221;?  The dearth of nuclear families and the proponderance of an &#8220;obligatory social safety net&#8221; is the result.  Hence a &#8220;village&#8221; that must be responsible for the delinquents spawned therein&hellip;. The &#8220;village&#8221; transmogrifies, though, into a veritable &#8220;Potemkin village&#8221; of false appearances and &#8220;HOPE&#8221; to the disoriented, disillusioned Black child who grows up with an absolute disdain of authority and blames all his/her troubles on this potemkin village&rsquo;s socialistic imperatives which could never fulfill what it means to be human and functional in a given society full of EXPECTED HANDOUTS.  And so Black males, weaned on dependence and excuse-making, will develop pathologies that will be implicit in a life of self-fulfilled prophecies of that all-too-used excuse of &#8220;Institutional Racism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to do a study on the lives of young white males that have grown up in broken or divorced homes to see how they compare to these blacks.  </p>
<p>My belief is that they will be more successful and stable by far.</p>

		<p>   To have any effect on the problem of disfunctional black ghetto culture we first have to change certain assumptions in our national culture that have proven to be false. During the first half of my life I would have described myself as a Liberal with a straight face ( though I had many reservations ).I assumed<br>
along with a majority of well meaning people at the time that if you gave poor people the means and motive to create better lives for themselves that they would choose the method that worked best for them to that end. I was wrong, the majority of the country was wrong.<br>
   A body in motion tends to stay in motion, a body at rest tends to stay at rest.Government programs were created and funded to serve the needs of the poor. ( As legally constructed<br>
these programs and the institutions that run them have no mandate<br>
to get people out of poverty. On the contrary, they have a vested interest in the continuity of poverty to validate thier continued existence . An ever expanding budget and staff is only<br>
possible if you can prove you have an ever expanding &#8221; client &#8221; base. The further fact that these programs are staffed by preferentialy hiring out of this &#8221; Client &#8221; base as a jobs program compounds the problem instead of addressing it.)</p>
<p>    Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach a man to fish,<br>
and he eats for a lifetime.The unspoken extension of this folk wisdom is that if you continue ot give a man a fish day after day as he resolutely refuses to learn to fish, the expectation will eventually change from  &#8221; please give me a fish &#8221; to &#8221; Fork  over the damn fish or I&rsquo;ll hurt you &#8220;. </p>
<p>    Serial charity is ultimately self defeating. Putting money into the ghetto to change the culture should take the form of <br>
INVESTMENT. A deal is made that requires performance on both sides .</p>
<p>   If a girl has a child out of wedlock at the age of fifteen <br>
She should be required to stay on government provided and maintained contraception for as long as she recieves government <br>
subsidy . That subsidy should be enough to provide real sustainence, medical and education for that one child and the mother. If she breaks the deal by getting pregnant again there would have to be consequences. The subsidy would be set to a given amount per mother that did not go up with the number of children she has. As long as there is economic incentive to breed children that they cannot suport themselves they will do so.There is also the extreme option of just stopping the subsidy <br>
completely in the worst cases. </p>
<p>   In the black urban ghetto the &#8221; Baby Mama &#8221; economy is largely a series of circular and cumulative government programs<br>
that couldn&rsquo;t make things much worse if they were planned to do<br>
so, ( and the cynic in me is not sure that they are not.)</p>
<p>   The &#8221; Baby Daddy &#8221; economy is a separate thing, Largely a function of the underground drug trade and related ripples of criminal entereprise going out from it. The expectations of<br>
young black males that this is thier only choice ( however false this assumption may be ),is essentially a nihilistic mindset that drives the downward spiral of thier subculture. As radical<br>
as it might seem, Legalizing and controlling drugs is the only way to take the profit out of this corrosive excercise. With no <br>
money in the underground economy, young black males would have<br>
to reenter the mainstream economy, with its assumptions of competence and stability.  Until the bad choice is closed to them, the better  choice will not be made.</p>

Good observation. For them, it DOES take  a village.  Blacks seems to take a communal attitude to everything.   They&rsquo;re essentially communistic.  </p>
<p>In places where I have worked, where there were many blacks, there were incessant collections being taken up for every conceivable thing.  Somebody&rsquo;s second cousin is getting married   &mdash;   collection!   Somebody&rsquo;s  niece&rsquo;s godchild is sick   &mdash;   collection!   These were for people you didn&rsquo;t even know.  But you were expected to give.  Finally, I just stopped giving to ALL collections, as a matter of policy.  </p>
<p>Instead of people relying on their own resources (and savings),  they expect everyone to pitch in and help them when some special need comes along.   Well, I didn&rsquo;t belong to their &#8220;village&#8221;, so I didn&rsquo;t contribute to it;  I know they wouldn&rsquo;t have contributed to mine.   Has anybody else experienced this?</p>

		<p>Even Obama&rsquo;s white Mother was thousands of miles away during most of his life.  She put him on a plane to Hawaii by himself at age 10 to live with grandparents he had seen for 2 years.  At that age, I was scared to take the late school bus home after a school activity because the route was different from the one taken by my usual bus.  I knew it would eventually get to my neighborhood but I was always nervous till it reached familiar territory.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the grandparents, Obama would have ended up in foster homes.</p>
<p>He and Michelle are still married however. In black culture marriage is a great achievement.</p>

		<p>I know the election is dead and buried, and no doubt Amren&rsquo;ers were probably talking about this a year ago, but on the subject of fathers.<br>
John McCains father Admiral John S. McCain Jr. &hellip;&hellip; <br>
from<br>
<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1220528,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1220528,00.html</a><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
&#8220;As a prisoner of war, Senator McCain declined an offer of early release by his Vietnamese captors, extending his stay at the Hanoi Hilton by almost four years and nine months. During that time, his father continued to approve air strikes against Hanoi, knowing his son was there&#8221;.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
And compare that to the story of Obama&rsquo;s poligomist and bigamist alcoholic, child abandoning father.<br>
And the contrast in the lessons these men&rsquo;s fathers taught them, in terms of having &#8216;a sense of duty&rsquo; is very stark.<br>
OK shooting in the direction of your son in a war is cold emotionally but, it is a real leaders decision that he made.<br>
On the other hand Barrack would have been a lot less marketable to the American public also, had his father&rsquo;s Kenyanisms been able to rub off on the young Obama.<br>
So one man&rsquo;s charactor was forged from his fathers lessons, while the other man&rsquo;s identity was made by him not having a father.<br>
Of course it&rsquo;s always more complicated than just that, but an interested contrast. </p>
<p>And to add McCains grandfather, Admiral John S. McCain Sr., served in the Pacific in World War II and was present at the Japanese surrender aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. <br>
Talk about a legacy, the world is certainly bucking tradition.<br>
It&rsquo;s bucking it right up.</p>
