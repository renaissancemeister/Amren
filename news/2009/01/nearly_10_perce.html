<h1><a href="https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HOUSING_LATINOS?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=US">Nearly 10 Percent of Latinos Lag on Mortgages</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, AP, January 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly one in 10 Latino homeowners fell behind in mortgage payments last year, and about 3 percent said they had received a foreclosure notice, a Hispanic research group reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s survey of Hispanic adults found that 9 percent said they missed a mortgage payment or made a partial payment during the past year. Nearly half of respondents, 47 percent, indicated they were homeowners, a figure consistent with census data that shows 49.5 percent of Hispanics owned their homes in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p>Among Hispanic renters, 5 percent said they had lived in a home that went into foreclosure in the past year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The center&rsquo;s survey of 1,540 Hispanic adults, conducted in English and Spanish last November, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Hispanics make up 15 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>The strain felt by Hispanic homeowners seemed consistent with that of all U.S. homeowners. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported last month that a record one in 10 American homeowners with a mortgage was at least one month behind on payments or in foreclosure at the end of September 2008.</p>
<p>Lautaro Diaz, a housing expert for the National Council of La Raza, said it&rsquo;s likely the numbers of Hispanics having trouble paying mortgages will increase given the fact that financial institutions marketed subprime mortgages or &#8220;exotic&#8221; loan products heavily to minorities, and often advertised in Spanish language media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

This article puts Steve Sailor on the defensive. He&rsquo;s been theorizing that Hispanics had a much higher default rate than other groups, and that this was part of the reason for the current mortgage market meltdown.</p>
<p>On the other hand .  .  . I&rsquo;m more ready to believe Steve Sailor than the Associated Press.</p>

			<p>I wonder if many of the Hispanic defaulters are counted as White for some statistical purposes, and Hispanic for others?  </p>

			<p>I was given some foreclosure orders to process at my job a few days ago. Based on the names, I figure that nearly 30% of the hapless homeowners were &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Lots of Illegals) + (Lots of Blacks) + (&#8220;Fair Housing&#8221; Laws) + (Easy Money from the Fed) + (Loan Officers&rsquo; Desire for Big Bonuses) = ECONOMIC DISASTER</p>

			<p>Folks this is the evidence that Hispanics are a significant factor behind the credit crisis that threatens to engulf us all. Thank you Pew for the disclosure.</p>

			<p>Here is a link to a case of Latino illegal who took out $787,000 in loans in a stolen Social Security number:</p>
<p>https://www.geocities.com/readerswrite/commentaries/Sponsored_speculation.htm#AddJan9</p>
<p>With an arrogance that is so characteristic to Hispanic invaders and their American collaborators, he told police during his arrest that &ldquo;they should be arresting real criminals and not a good family man.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Do we need to know anything else?<br>
