	<p>A protest over the fatal shooting by a BART police officer of an unarmed black man mushroomed into several hours of violence Wednesday night as demonstrators smashed storefronts and cars, set several cars ablaze and blocked streets in downtown Oakland.</p>
<p>The roving mob expressed fury at police and frustration over society&rsquo;s racial injustice. Yet the demonstrators were often indiscriminate, frequently targeting the businesses and prized possessions of people of color.</p>
<p>They smashed a hair salon, a pharmacy and several restaurants. Police in riot gear tried to control the crowd, but some people retreated along 14th Street and bashed cars along the way.</p>
<p>The mob smashed the windows at Creative African Braids on 14th Street, and a woman walked out of the shop holding a baby in her arms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wednesday night&rsquo;s vandalism victims had nothing to do with the shooting death by a BART police officer of Oscar Grant on New Year&rsquo;s Day &mdash; but that did little to sway the mob.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like the night is going great,&#8221; said Nia Sykes, 24, of San Francisco, one of the demonstrators. &#8220;I feel like Oakland should make some noise. This is how we need to fight back. It&rsquo;s for the murder of a black male.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sykes, who is black, had little sympathy for the owner of Creative African Braids.</p>
<p>&#8220;She should be glad she just lost her business and not her life,&#8221; Sykes said. She added that she did have one worry for the night: &#8220;I just hope nobody gets shot or killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums met the mob on 14th Street, urging calm and leading them on a walk to City Hall, where he gave a speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sense your frustration,&#8221; he told the crowd. &#8220;I understand that you&rsquo;ve lost confidence in a process because you&rsquo;ve seen what you believe is a homicide &hellip; But listen to me, we are a community of people. We are civilized people. We are a nation of laws.</p>
<p>Dellums told protesters that he had asked the Oakland Police Department to investigate the shooting. &#8220;I have asked Oakland police to engage in a fair, parallel investigation, the way you&rsquo;d investigate any homicide in Oakland,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that leads to an arrest, that&rsquo;s what it would lead to.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But soon after, a man shouted &#8220;that&rsquo;s the modern day lynching&#8221; and the mob quickly continued its rampage, smashing at least seven storefronts on 17th street between Franklin and Webster streets. They also smashed eight cars, including four belonging to the City of Oakland.</p>
<p>Near 14th and Alice streets, Myron Bell was taking dance lessons in &#8220;step,&#8221; a form of dance popular among African Americans, when he looked out the window and saw people jumping on his Lexus sedan.</p>
<p>Bell, 42, came out to find that almost all of the car&rsquo;s windows, including the front and back had been smashed and it appeared that someone had tried to set the car on fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m for the cause,&#8221; said Bell, who is black. &#8220;But I&rsquo;m against the violence and destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearby, Godhuli Bose stood near her smashed Toyota Corolla as a man walked by, repeatedly called her a misogynist slur and then added, &#8220;F- your car.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, when the mob first appeared downtown, Oakland Police Officer Michael Cardoza parked his car across the intersection of Eighth and Madison streets, to prevent traffic from flowing toward Broadway and into the protest. But he told The Chronicle that a group of 30 to 40 protesters quickly surrounded his car and started smashing it with bottles and rocks.</p>
<p>Cardoza jumped out of the car and said some protesters tried to set the car on fire, while others jumped on top of the hood &mdash; incidents repeatedly shown on television. Cardoza said the protesters &#8220;were trying to entice us into doing something.&#8221; A Chronicle reporter saw a fist-sized rock in the back seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other protesters marched on BART&rsquo;s 12th Street Station about 7 p.m., prompting the transit agency to close the downtown hub station even as it was reopening the Lake Merritt and Fruitvale stations.</p>
<p>The mob blocked the intersection of 14th and Broadway, near the downtown BART station entrance. As police put on helmets and gas masks and stood in a line formation, some demonstrators held signs that read, &#8220;Your idea of justice?&#8221; and &#8220;Jail Killer Cops.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some in the mob wore masks over their faces as they yelled at police. Roughly a dozen stood just a few feet away from police as they screamed at them. Chants included &#8220;pigs go home,&#8221; &#8220;the fascist police, no justice, no peace&#8221; and &#8220;we are all Oscar Grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandingo Hayes, who is black, said he participated in the protest because &#8220;we&rsquo;re tired of all these police agencies getting away with shooting unarmed black and Latino males.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The core group of the mob appeared to be about 40 people, several of whom were with Revolution Books, a Berkeley bookstore. A man distributed the &#8220;Revolution&#8221; newspaper &mdash; whose tagline is &#8220;voice of the Revolutionary Communist Party, U.S.A.&#8221; &mdash; as he shouted &#8220;This whole damn system is guilty!&#8221;</p>
<p>Soo Jung Sung, an Asian American, didn&rsquo;t understand why she was to blame. She wept as she looked at the shattered front windshield of her Nissan Montero.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28555278/">Protests Over Calif. Train Shooting Turn Violent</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>MSNBC, January 8, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer turned violent Wednesday night as demonstrators smashed windows, set fire to several cars and blocked streets.</p>
<p>A few hundred protesters took the streets of downtown Oakland to condemn the shooting and call for criminal charges against 27-year-old officer Johannes Mehserle.</p>
<p>Oakland police arrested at least 105 protesters on charges that included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism, arson and drug possession, the Oakland Tribune reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Mehserle resigned from the transit agency shortly before he was supposed to be interviewed by investigators Wednesday. He has not yet explained why he fatally shot 22-year-old Oscar Grant of Hayward as he lay face-down on a BART station platform on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p><b>New Year&rsquo;s Day shooting</b></p>
<p>Police said Mehserle was one of several officers responding to reports about groups of men fighting on a train.</p>
<p>Grant, a supermarket worker, was unarmed when he was shot in the back, according to police. The Alameda County coroner&rsquo;s office said Wednesday that the bullet fired by Mehserle apparently went through him and ricocheted off the concrete platform before re-entering his body. It was the ricochet wound to the torso that caused Grant&rsquo;s death, it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Protesters set fire to a trash container and tried to overturn a police car, smashing the front window. Police attempted to disperse the crowd and smaller groups of protesters marched to different areas.</p>
<p>Some protesters threw bottles, smashing a window of a fast-food restaurant and other downtown stores. At least three cars were set on fire and many other automobiles were damaged.</p>
<p>Many protesters expressed anger and frustration at the police and what they called society&rsquo;s racial injustice.</p>
<p>But as the demonstrations continued, the mob frequently targeted the business, cars and homes of people without regard to race, the San Francisco Chronicle reported early Thursday.</p>
<p>One such shop was Creative African Braids in Oakland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s family has filed a $25 million wrongful death claim against BART and want prosecutors to file criminal charges against Mehserle.</p>
<p>BART spokesman Linton Johnson told the Chronicle that transit officials had expected to hear Mehserle&rsquo;s account of the shooting on Wednesday. But instead, the officer&rsquo;s attorney and the president of BART&rsquo;s police union appeared and gave officials a short resignation letter from the BART officer. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chronicle, quoting a source familiar with the investigation, also reported that BART is looking into whether Mehserle mistook his service weapon for a Taser stun gun, among many other possibilities.</p>
<p>Oakland police, meanwhile, were bracing for another protest on Thursday outside BART headquarters. {snip}<br>

			<p>This just goes to show the intellegence of the people involved with the riot. I also noticed that the author of the piece seemed to be upset with the fact that the rioters damaged businesses belonging to &#8220;people of color&#8221; rather than the fact that there was a riot to begin with. </p>

			<p>About 20 years ago on BART, there was a couple of black youffs, age 17 and 18, I think.One of them picked a fight with a white in his 30s, I think. They fought for a while, and then the fight ended.A few moments after the fight, the one who fought with the man pulled a knife and fatally stabbed him  to death. That was one of the few violent incidents that ever happened on BART that I know about. The fatal shooting of the young black on BART was very unfortunate and tragic.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The roving mob expressed fury at police and frustration over society&rsquo;s racial injustice. Yet the demonstrators were often indiscriminate, frequently targeting the businesses and prized possessions of people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>This begs the question that if they&rsquo;re responding to the myth of racial injustice, why would they target their own people?  Too, leave it to the pitiful excuses for reporters in the yellow journalistic rag, the SF Chronicle, to give legitimacy to these black thugs for committing what amount to criminal pursuits that are prompted by their  make up.</p>
<p>These are simply acts of crime by a group of people who are beset with an inability to control their impulses.  They don&rsquo;t belong in an advanced civilization</p>
<p>&#8220;Wednesday night&rsquo;s vandalism victims had nothing to do with the shooting death by a BART police officer of Oscar Grant on New Year&rsquo;s Day &mdash; but that did little to sway the mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then why was it reported as being a riot against racial injustice if the overwhelming evidence reveals it was nothing more than common crime? </p>
<p>Everytime a black is involved in violence, brainwashed white multicults want to excuse it somehow.  But then again what else can they do?  They&rsquo;ve been so gullibly programmed into leftist ideology defending blacks comes automatically and kicks in immediately just as any conditioned reflex would do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get worse and before all is said and done many of these leftist news geeks will have experienced the evil face of black criminality up close and personal.</p>
<p>And when they do, that will tell us that justice has finally arrived.</p>

			<p>Evidenced by the quote that &#8220;this is going great&#8221; and Communist Party involvement, this is just an outlandish demonstration by the joint forces of the far left and black radicals.  In the time which they organized this, there were probably several blacks killed by other blacks in Oakland, they can&rsquo;t get worked up about that.  </p>
<p>What I have not yet found out is the race of the cops who had to use this level of force.  I&rsquo;m assuming that these protesters are assuming that the cops are white, hence the reaction.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a bit more to this tale than is reported in the anti white, anti police pro black criminal media.</p>
<p>First, Frutivale station where Oscar Grant was shot is well known for thugging.  That is black thugs hanging out in the station and in the plaza outside harassing passengers and accosting women.  It is the most dangerous station in the whole Bart system.  The very fact that Bart goes through Oakland, Richmond and other black communities makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>San Mateo County refused to let Bart go further than Daly City.  Ultra liberal wealthy Marin County refused to let Bart expand anywhere near the area because black thugs from the East Bay use Bart as a place to hang out and harass people as well as getting off Bart and committing robberies and worse.</p>
<p>Oscar Grant got out of prison 4 months ago.  He has a long and violent criminal record.  Bart usually closes at midnight.  Bart stayed running until 3/am on New Year&rsquo;s eve to accommodate revellers.  Oscar and his hommies created a mini riot actually a gang fight at the Frutivale station.  Bart police were called.  The rioters refused to calm down.  Oscar took it upon himself to get in the face of the officers.</p>
<p>Oscar is the type of career criminal who eventually gets three strikes and spends the rest of his life in prison or gets killed by either police or his homies or a rival gang.</p>
<p>Oscar did have a fast food job.  He did visit his illegitimate child and baby mama when he was released from prison.  So the media is doing its usual fill in the blanks template stories of this wonderful young man who was turning his life around and actually visitiing his child. And working!!!!!!!! Actually, working was a condition of parole.</p>
<p>Last year, there were 123 homicides in Oakland.  More than 100 of the homicides were young black men killed by other young black men.  But there were no protests, no poverty pimp clergy hooting and hollering, no protests.</p>
<p>For years there has been some thought of closing down Fruitvale station entirely because of the crowds of thugs hanging around.  But Fruitvale station services thousands of people who need to get to work in San Francisco and other parts of the Bay area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that Bart has to go anywhere near Oakland.  You can get from city to city on Bart in 20 minutes whereas it can take 1 hour by car and 2 hours by bus.  But unfortunately Bart goes through Oakland and Richmond and thugs board the trains and hang around the stations robbing, assaulting and harassing passengers.</p>
<p>I remember when Bart was built in the 1970&rsquo;s.  Liberals and the media blamed much of the disfunction and crime in Oakland to the fact that it took so long for black Oaklanders to get across the bridges and freeways to jobs.  So they built Bart which gets people from Oakland to downtown San Francisco and other job centers.  But Oakland blacks are as unemployed, criminal and messed up as they before Bart was built.</p>
<p>Many Bay area residents have suggested that Bart be rebuilt to go around Oakland and Richmond entirely.  But that would be a horrendous expense.</p>

			<p>Hasn&rsquo;t law enforcement learned yet the fact that when blacks are out preying on others and driving their community into third-world status, they&rsquo;re to be treated with kid gloves?  </p>
<p>After the fires go out, and the damage is complete, expect the government to come in and start hemmoraging tax money in the area.  Our politicians reward this insanity every time it <br>
happens.  </p>
<p>And what a putz this mayor is.  He&rsquo;ll &#8220;talk&#8221; them into peaceful calm. Sheesh!</p>
<p>Of course, there is one way to end the violence right now and in a hurry, but&hellip;.it will never happen.  </p>

			<p>The real news here is that this has not been picked up by the major media. I did find the article on the AP website, but had to do a search to find it. This is one of those stories which pick up steam and then break out. The black community tends to be unfocused until something like this happens. It looks like a mistake/tragedy that it happened, but this does not warrant a dose of &#8220;street justice&#8221; (e.g. riots). We will see if this can be contained without a lot of bloodshed. But, again, the real story is that I had to find this on the AR site, and not the news. </p>

There are many telling quotes here which add up to senseless, wanton, indiscriminant destruction.</p>
<p>Here is a link to video of the shooting:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/05/MN0R153LGU.DTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/05/MN0R153LGU.DTL</a></p>
<p>By the account of the witness/videographer, the victim appeared to be co-operating with the police and the police were said to be aggressive. What we don&rsquo;t see is what led the police to detain these guys and why they were after these guys in the first place. </p>
<p>What I see in the video is the crowd provoking and confronting the police. It&rsquo;s easy to see the police feeling out numbered and threatened. While we can never get into the mind of the police at that moment, the video clearly shows the police were confronted by an unruly mob intent on pushing their buttons.  </p>
<p>What led to the detainment of these men is unclear. What is clear is that the police were out numbered and dealing with a hostile mob. From what I see the shooting seems to have happened as a result of the crowd provoking the police.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;ll never know what would have happened had the crowd not swarmed the police, it does appear to me that the crowd played a role in escalating tension during this confrontation.</p>

			<p>I wonder if nice San Francisco lefties are still worried about all the blacks leaving the city. If they&rsquo;d like, they can move across to Oakland and experience the diversity and tolerance that blacks are famous for.</p>

			<p>Here we are in January 2009 about to innaugurate a black President and commemorate a black martyr, only to find whitey has still managed to cause black riots by our racism.</p>
<p>I, for one, will be celebrating the 130th anniversary of the defense of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift this month instead. They have their heroes, we should have ours. And never the twain should meet.<br>

			<p>Three points:</p>
<p>1. Very noteworthy here:  black vandals don&rsquo;t care if their victims are black. Expressing anger and being destructive are more important than racial solidarity. </p>
<p>2. The San Francisco Chronicle writers use both the term &#8220;demonstrators&#8221; and the word &#8220;mob.&#8221; It&rsquo;s like they couldn&rsquo;t decide what tone to take, so they decided to split the difference.</p>
<p>3. The indiscriminate nature of the violence supports the idea, often expressed here on Amren, that you should avoid living near blacks. This story really hammers that point home.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll betcha this is another case of CopGlockitis.  Glock triggers and perps on the ground &hellip; a very bad mix. It&rsquo;s happened plenty of times before. Do a youtube search for the DEA agent who negligently fires his Glock in a classroom, to see how easily they are fired negligently. </p>

<p>The first sentence is obviously a mistake. Todays writers hold no bias. Let me correct the errors for the good readers here at AmRen: The roving mob expressed fury at the police and frustration over their INCORRECTLY PERCEIVED VIEWS about society&rsquo;s racial injustice.</p>
<p>The second sentence too must be in error. The writer expresses shock that these fine rioters would destroy the property of INNOCENT black folks property instead of concentrating on the property of the guilty, namely white people&hellip;.Since the left assures us there is no media bias, I can only assume this was an unintentional typo of some sort. How did this get by the editor? I will now read the other 95% of this article. </p>

			<p>When are whites going to go on a rampage in protests of blacks killing whites, or raping whites???? See it is okay for them to act out, and they don&rsquo;t even know the real story of what happened&hellip;..I figure the black tried to reach for the officers gun&hellip;.it was the blacks fault&hellip;he was caught in the act of committing a felony&hellip;.but they think hes innocent after all its a race thing once again!!</p>

			<p>Blacks have a very strange sense of &#8220;outrage&#8221;, the most dangerous thing to a black male is another black male. They will murder each other in a heart beat without so much as whimper from the black community. But, if a cop (especially a white cop) kills a black male they all engage in this big charade of pretending to care for each other and proceed to destroy things.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The core group of the mob appeared to be about 40 people, several of whom were with Revolution Books, a Berkeley bookstore. A man distributed the &ldquo;Revolution&rdquo; newspaper &mdash; whose tagline is &ldquo;voice of the Revolutionary Communist Party, U.S.A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Communists are no doubt associated with the notorious &#8220;Black Block&#8221;, the sole function of which is the instigation and propagation of anarchy.  I&rsquo;m convinced that a lot of riots are inspired by them.  The reds are always looking for an excuse to riot, they don&rsquo;t actually care about the cause, especially not an individual being killed by &#8220;the system&#8221;.  Individuals are not valued by Communists.</p>
<p>Am I dreaming or haven&rsquo;t we fought wars to keep Communists out of power in other countries?  If the government is so anxious to declare certain National Socialist and white power organizations a terrorist threat, then why is it that Communists aren&rsquo;t also smeared by this label?</p>

<p>Notice how the Chronicle reporters casually assume that society IS indeed permeated by racial injustice.  Just the kind of bias-free journalism one expects from that paper.</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if the dead man was a thug. We don&rsquo;t need militarized police shooting people in the back. This is a notable story from the AR perspective because of the typical race hustlers who are rioting. But I don&rsquo;t warm up to either side of the cop/thug incident.</p>

When I get off, I have to wash the car, clean the garage, feed the dogs, go to ball games, wash cloths, pay bills and then try to get some sleep before it all starts all over again.  Wonder where they get all the time off to participate in such events?</p>

			<p>I share everone&rsquo;s sentiments regarding these marauding thugs both before and during the riots. However, one has to admit that it is getting harder and harder to defend the apparent inclination of the police to shoot first and ask questions later with increasing frequency. Too many times in recent years, there have been widely reported incidents of cops shooting unarmed individuals&hellip;and they weren&rsquo;t all Black either! </p>
<p>I realize cops are often asked to do an almost impossible job policing the non-white riff-raff of this country. Nevertheless, it concerns me that all too often now, their actions only provide ammunition(no pun intended)to the race-hustlers and general thuggery themsleves to whine and moan about &#8220;racial injustice&#8221; and all that foolishness. And despite the wailing from the usual suspects, it isn&rsquo;t only &#8220;young black males&#8221; in the crosshairs.  </p>

			<blockquote>I live in the East Bay and take BART almost every day.I&rsquo;ve seen the phenomenon of black thugs going from car to car harassing passengers many times Somehow I&rsquo;ve never been singled out by the little punks, but it&rsquo;s a nerve-wracking experience just the same. Lots of racial epithets and menacing glares at the stations, though, which are indeed thug magnets .I grew up in Detroit, for pete&rsquo;s sake, but I&rsquo;ve never experienced the level of hostility and just downright, spit-on-the-ground-as-you-pass contempt for whites as I have in the Bay Area, including San Francisco.</blockquote>
<blockquote> I got to listen to the Berkeley weeping-hippy radio station today, which ran a two hour special on &#8220;The Assassination of Oscar Grant&#8221;. They broadcast segments of a BART public meeting today at which the public was allowed to speak. I thought my head was going to explode.</blockquote>
<blockquote> Now, I&rsquo;m somebody who was raised to not be racist, who has always wished the best for the black community. I know many fine black people who I admire and respect, but in my ten years in the Bay Area, I have completely lost faith in the chances of that community as a whole to ever get it together . The histrionic, deluded idiocy coming out of these people was just mind-blowing, even once you got past all the inappropriately-used big words. They&rsquo;ve completely glommed onto the assassination angle. Now, to my mind, assassination implies the planned murder of a public figure or other person of some importance. Even if Oscar Grant was completely innocent of any misbehavior and the cop did intentionally shoot him, it would be tragic, maybe murder, but not an assassination by any stretch of the imagination.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>They presented a world in which a black person can&rsquo;t walk down the street without being harassed and shot at by vicious white cops. Funny. I bet any of the speakers at that meeting could walk through any white area in the country and not be bothered in any way, assuming they weren&rsquo;t causing any trouble, whereas I have to watch my back every time I go out for a gallon of milk and there are entire districts in every major urban area that any white person would have to be insane to walk through at any time of day or night. Black kids are killing each other in Oakland at a rate of about two per week, and are, what, 50 times more likely to attack whites than the other way around and these jackasses made it sound like every day they have to run a gauntlet of vicious, trigger-happy white racists. I&rsquo;m sorry to go on and on, but the level of disconnect with any kind of objective reality was just stunning.</blockquote>
<blockquote> Look, I can at least understand people getting up in arms about an Amadou Diallo or Abner Louima-type incident, but these cops weren&rsquo;t emptying their clips into the guy, or assaulting him with broomsticks. I&rsquo;ve seen the films of the incident and I know I&rsquo;m biased towards the cops  on this, but I honestly can&rsquo;t see how it could have been anything other than a tragic accident. Not letting the cop completely off the hook; he screwed up horribly, and it looks like he realized it right away, but an accident just the same. These people are presenting  the incident as emblematic of  the Oakland and BART police departments horrible, racist policies. I&rsquo;m sorry, but that&rsquo;s just insane, even from my somewhat liberal perspective. Police departments in every major city have been bending over backwards to accommodate the black community for at least three decades now. Detroit had STRESS in the &rsquo;70s, a decoy operation to deal with street robberies. Big community outcry over it targeting blacks, unit disbanded, crime skyrockets. Daryl Gates coming down hard on the Crips and Bloods in LA in the &rsquo;80s. Again, community outcry, etc. Gates was forced to back down, crime went through the roof, and now we have gangs in every major city. I guarantee we&rsquo;ll see something similar here, even with the free pass black thugs are already given to &#8220;express themselves&#8221;. I sincerely believe that the only thing that would satisfy these fools would be the Mayor just disbanding the police department altogether.</blockquote>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;The fatal shooting of the young black on BART was very unfortunate and tragic.&#8221;</p>
<p>No&hellip;it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m sure if you had been there&hellip;you&rsquo;d agree. I wasn&rsquo;t there, but then again, I don&rsquo;t give any black the benifit of the doubt. It&rsquo;s too dangerous, whether you&rsquo;re an armed peace officer or not. NO ONE just stands there and gets plugged by cops for no reason. This isn&rsquo;t the movies. Don&rsquo;t believe everything your liberals tell you on your TV.</p>
<p> While I don&rsquo;t have sympathy for cops and their eff&rsquo;ups, I&rsquo;m not going to loose any sleep over this. Oakland deserves what it gets. Oh yeah, the part where the Mayor joins the rioters cracks me up&hellip;</p>
<p> You want &#8220;Unfortunate and Tragic&#8221;? Just let blacks do whatever they want. But let them do it in YOUR neighborhood, Peejay. Don&rsquo;t call the police, don&rsquo;t do ANYTHING that may provoke them. You never know, one of them might be &#8220;unarmed&#8221;.<br>

			<p>In this rare instance I cannot blame blacks for rioting.  The Police all over America are out of control.  Given a green light by their &#8216;Big Brother&rsquo; government Police are more embolden nowadays to abuse their powers. Individuals who become Police are, by their very nature, authoritarians who MUST excersize this authority in order for them to merely cope.  Anyone who has had to deal with TSA at airports has seen this tyrannical need to press their &#8216;power&rsquo; at the least sign of a chance to do so. DUI laws have now gotten into the realm of absurd where a single beer can land you in jail.  The Republican Convention saw a preview of the Police State coming our way, and no one who saw or attended that convention could NOT notice the militaristic look and actions the government goons displayed.  The shooting by the BART officer was clearly NOT necessary, but - nevertheless - is a glimpse into what is coming for the rest of us very soon.</p>

			<p>We had a saying in South Africa where I lived for 24 years until &#8220;escaping&#8221; in 1999. &#8220;You can take a black out of the bush (jungle) but you cannot take the bush out of a black&#8221;.  Even when these rioters are the product of several generations living in a civilised country/continent, but the old genes still come to the fore.  The law will deal with the shooter and find out why he did it.  That is civilised justice.</p>
<p>It is a pity that all the US black people cannot go to Africa where they can be happy and try to civilise that continent (sic).  The problem is that most in Africa (except the newly obscenely rich) want to leave and live in the West now that the European &#8220;colonisers&#8221; are being driven out and the economies and public services are failing.  It is a great pity for there must be a lot of US black people who are just as appalled by this incident and the over-reaction of the black mob.  What is their reaction aginst the mob?</p>

<p>Entice. An interesting choice of words from Officer Cardoza. Entice is to lead on by exciting hope or desire. Officer Cardoza feels as though the protesters were appealing to his hope and desire to beat the heck out of these folks.

<p>One small episode of possible Justice with a capital J may be the management burden placed on mayor Ron &#8220;Red&#8221; Dellums, Others may recall his tenure in Congress, doing no good for the US, I&rsquo;m sure.

<p>And it was no surprise at all that important details of the shooting incident were omitted  &mdash;  in particular the behavior of &#8220;victim&#8221; and &#8220;bystanders&#8221; that preceded (dare I say &#8220;provoked&#8221;?) the whole mess.</p>

How much economic stimulus will it take to make shoppers overcome their fear of riding BART?  What is more recessionary than black crime?  </p>
<p>Have you noticed how quickly the mere anticipation of Obama&rsquo;s tax plan (It takes a suburb) has rocked the economy  &mdash;  a million and a half jobs lost in three months?  I fear that many high wage earners have come to feel it their patriotic duty to drive the country into a deep, lingering depression.    </p>

<p>The Rodney King riots were instigated by the Communist book store downtown.  The communists led the blacks to attack city hall, the county building, police headquarters and other government buildings located near the communist book store the first afternoon of the riots.</p>
<p>It was also the communists who sent the mob to Koreatown which is located near the civic center.</p>
<p>17 years later, Koreatown is one of the most prosperous areas of the city.  In addition it has expanded about five miles west of downtown. The entire midwilshire area is becoming Koreatown.</p>
<p>Koreatown grows both in size and prosperity every year.  Who knows, someday it may stretch from downtown to Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>The information you communicate comes from being a resident?</p>
<p>To find out the truth, go to google.com  Type in SFgate.com protests over BART shooting.</p>
<p>You will find the news article.  Then read the comments.  There are hundreds of them.  Many are from people who ride BART everyday.  Their comments are full of stories about thugging, the practice of hanging around BART stations.  You will also find in the comments the truth about the victim Oscar Grant, a violent felon on parole.</p>
<p>Oscar and his hommies were fighting with another gang causing a mini riot in the station.  That is why the police arrived.  They had to control the unruly crowd of black thugs looking to ruin New Year&rsquo;s Eve for everyone else..</p>
<p>Oscar and others choose to confront the police.</p>
<p>When BART was built 35 years ago, the planners allowed for a very large police force and video cameras everywhere.  BART police are stationed in each station.  They are not always a visible presence, but they watch the videos and as soon as they see any trouble coming or even someone jumping the turnstile without paying they are right there.</p>
<p>The planners allowed for this strong law enforcement presence precisely because BART would be going through Oakland and on to Richmond.  Planners knew that commuters would never take a subway through Oakland unless they knew they would be safe from robbery, assault, rape and even murder by the black thugs of Oakland.</p>
<p>Were it not for the strong police presence, few would take BART because it goes through Oakland.<br>

<p>Allison and witnesses gave this account of the events leading up to Grant&rsquo;s death: </p>
<p>Apparently, two groups of young men were fighting on the train, which had come from San Francisco. Sometime while the train was en route to Dublin/Pleasanton, BART&rsquo;s operations control center learned of the disturbance and dispatched five BART police officers to the Fruitvale Station about 2 a.m. The train was ordered to stop and hold at Fruitvale so the police could deal with the situation. </p>
<p>The train arrived at Fruitvale, and police began trying to isolate the young men as they fought. Officers believe the group included Grant.</p>
<p>As officers attempted to control the situation, the two groups apparently continued to scuffle on the platform. At one point, three or four individuals on the platform were handcuffed, Allison said. Two people involved in the scuffle were detained, questioned by police and later released. </p>

			<p>BART should cease running trains at midnight every night of the year. Nothing but a bunch of drunks and troublemakers past that point. I would also permanently close the Richmond, Fruitvale, 16th Street, and West Oakland Stations. This would speed things up and stop a lot of the troublemakers who get on the trains.</p>

<p>The City of San Francisco had fireworks on the waterfront for New year&rsquo;s eve.  A lot of people from the east bay came to San Francisco to watch the fireworks.  The fireworks were on the Embarcadero.  People used the Embarcadero BART station to go to and return from the fireworks. New Year&rsquo;s eve revellers took BART trains all over SAn Francisco and Daly City.</p>
<p>But only the train going through black areas had a problem which began with a gang fight and ended in a death.</p>

			<p>Well, I for one am looking forward to the follow-on article where they interview the decedent&rsquo;s mother and friends and they shed some light on how awesome a human being he was. Some common themes that I&rsquo;d expect to see in that article: </p>
<p>He went through some tough patches, but was just getting his life together; he was just getting ready to enroll in a GED course so he could earn his HS diploma and get a decent job; he was really a great father to the kids he&rsquo;s fathered with numerous underaged girls. Anyone think the formula&rsquo;s off a bit? Someone I doubt this was a Cal or Stanford student studying to be a doctor who got into a bit of trouble and was accidentally shot.</p>

<p>Fill in the Blanks: My son ____ was a good kid. He always went to church, was a A+ student in school and helped little old ladies across the street. That incident where he strangled the cat and set the dog on fire was blown out of proportion by the racist police who setup little _____. Just because he was raping a white woman at gunpoint and killed two children for giving him dirty looks is no reason for the police to get excited. I will sue the city of ______ and the police for ___ Millions! The dirty racist police always had it out for _____ and they finally got him!</p>

			<p>What kind of society do we want to live in? </p>
<p>One where - if you get robbed or beaten on BART you can hope that law enforcement will arrive, control the situation, and then arrest the bad guys? Or one where the after you get robbed and beaten and you report it to the cops the perpetrators are long gone? </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a normal person you&rsquo;re hoping that BART police are there to protect you. If you are a gangster, a gangster sympathizer, a lawyer looking for a cash payout from a law suit, or a relative that&rsquo;s done some time in jail - you&rsquo;re probably hoping some hype will convict the BART police officer before he gets a chance to explain what happened. I&rsquo;d like to see Oscar Grant myspace page or rap sheet. That would tell us a lot about how he lived his life.</p>

			<p>The family sure could have found a better picture of Mr Grant than the one I saw on KTVU would have made any parent proud. I find it suspicious that his friend are all saying there was nothing going on yet there have been plenty of people on all sides talking about how loud and rowdy it was on the train and the platform, And whats up with the unnamed girlfriend who is afraid to be seen on TV acting like the rival gang is going to takeout the witnesses</p>

			<p>The BART train is transportation. You should get on the train, sit or stand until you reach your destination, then get off the train and head home or wherever you are going. Don&rsquo;t fight on BART, then you won&rsquo;t get shot. </p>
<p>I witnessed several girls beating one girl on an AC Transit bus several years ago. I called the police. AC Transit incidents are handled by the sheriff&rsquo;s dept and so the police dispatcher sent them. When the sheriffs arrived, the girls ran. I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt badly about it if a &#8220;gun discharged&#8221; and one or more of the rat pack had been shot. I&rsquo;m sure Burris would be up in arms about their civil rights. No one seemed to think about the rights of the girl who was jumped.</p>

			<p>When viewing the MSM reports, it is easy to see that there are many Whites involved in the rioting.  How many, we can&rsquo;t know and I am sure that the MSM is attempting to showcase the multi-racial components in the mob.  The repeated image of a White male being forcefully arrested is very obviously aimed at creating this image.</p>
<p>I used to know the East Bay pretty well.  I was at a college for a special post educational program five years ago.  I met a young senior there.  He was White, intelligent, eager, etc., all the things you&rsquo;d hope to find in a young professional.  Yet in one conversation where politics arose, he smugly announced that he was an Anarchist.  </p>
<p>Peejay in Frisco probably knows this as well; SF and the East Bay in particular has been producing and promoting a sort of pseudo-intellectual brand of communist-anarchy in all aspects of life since the 1960s.  It did this by  making it seem &#8220;hip&#8221; and very fashionably anti-establishment.  There is no way to reason anyone out of it, much like with a committed fundamentalist of any world religion.  Rioting is more of a ritual than a calculated reaction.  We now have generations who do what they do out of traditions.  For them, there is nothing so elating as a good old cop car burning, glass breaking, riot with the police line threatening them.  It makes them one with the SDS and other earlier groups who at least had some real issue to cite for their civil disobediance.  Today, the participants are robotic, just as many of their detractors reply with three, four decade old criticisms.</p>

			<p>The violence and destruction has occured before during and after this guy got wacked has been going on for decades.  This is why all the normal white people have left.  There are areas of Oakland where you absolutely do not want to get caught in alone, day or night, if you are white.  That however is not considered violence or racism.  It is only when the police are forced to apprehend some violent punk that trouble occurs.  Anarcho-Tyrany is now the order of the day.  It is a war zone and the police are as traumatized as the rest of us.     </p>

			<p>Shooting an unarmed suspect in the back once he is prone is murder under color of law, and I hope the officer is prosecuted.  The fact that the transit officer said he was &#8220;reaching for a taser&#8221; shows he already understands what he did was a serious no-no.  Police who are allowed to go about armed should be expected to exercise better judgement than this.</p>
<p>That said, starting a fight on public transportation is asking for trouble, and burning the stores and vehicles of innocent citizens is criminal arson.  The correct method of stopping fights is pepper spray, and the correct method of stopping mobs of rampaging arsonists is the liberal application of Rule 7.62.</p>

<p>The long term effect of all this is that BART police will be ordered to leave thugs and troublemakers alone.  So thugs will harass passengers even more than they do now making BART unsafe.<br>
BART&rsquo;s really the only way to get around the East Bay and San Francisco quickly.  You can ride from San Francisco airport to Dublin, a distance of about 70 miles in less than an hour. And you&rsquo;re not stuck in that parking lot of bridges and freeways.</p>
<p>Like so many things, blacks will ruin BART as they ruined the subways of New York before Guilliani cracked down on the thugs.</p>

			<p>A fifteen second grainy clip on YOUTUBE notwithstanding, I find it very hard to believe the cop just got out of bed that morning and just out of the blue decided to just shoot and kill some black male (and in the presence of numerous witnesses). I also find it exceedingly difficult to believe the black male in question was some knight in shining armour who just happened to be minding his own business and was taken down and killed for no reason at all. Only 22 years old and he&rsquo;s got a four year old daughter? Probably illegimate, conceived via your standard &#8216;baby-mama&rsquo;. I also wouldn&rsquo;t doubt he has a criminal record and had been in trouble before. As for the cop he has already been convicted in the P.C. sanctioned court of public opinion.</p>

			<p>Peejay is out to lunch, there have been many violent incidents started by blacks on BART over the years. Black on black crime and black on white crime here in Oakland alone dwarfs an accidental shooting. The BART cops are overpaid union goons who mostly harass commuters with petty traffic stuff and they could be replaced by all the local police agencies on the BART routes.<br>
But the Left and the blacks don&rsquo;t need an excuse to loot and burn, they are primed to do this at all times. John Burris is an<br>
ambulance chaser who specializes in lawsuits against cops.<br>
We need to expose all these types including the media who egg them on. Thanks for your good work, AR.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my impression too of blacks here in the Bay area.</p>
<p>In fact, a white friend of mine who lived here in Berkeley had attended a mostly black high school somewhere in Ohio, and invited an old high school chum (black) of his to visit him here in Berkeley.</p>
<p>After a day of exploring the area, the black fellow said to my friend something like, &#8220;What&rsquo;s with all these (blacks) out here?  &mdash;  they all have a burr up their (behind).&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll betcha this is another case of CopGlockitis. Glock triggers and perps on the ground &hellip; a very bad mix. It&rsquo;s happened plenty of times before. Do a youtube search for the DEA agent who negligently fires his Glock in a classroom, to see how easily they are fired negligently.</p>
<p><br>
Yeah ummm, no they aren&rsquo;t.  And you would know that if you ever fired, let alone owned one.  I happen to own one of these fine weapons.  Not only is it one of the finest made instruments ever made but it is extremely difficult to fire accidentally.  The trigger has a smooth, but very heavy pull, almost like a revolver.  And a safety switch right on the trigger that makes the trigger almost impossible to pull except by a finger correctly placed on it for firing the weapon.  As for that video of the &#8220;DEA agent&#8221; accidentally discharging one.  That was some black going out of his way to mishandle his firearms.  A close view of the clip shows he actually pulled his sidearm out by the trigger when it discharged&hellip;so, of course it fired.  Makes one wonder if he actually knew the basics of guns (like umm, they discharge when you pull the trigger&hellip;.duh).  Being that he was black, which means an average IQ of 85 (retarded) the answer to that is probably not.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the extremely high quality, extremely high tech, well engineered firearm for accidents when you hand it to a primate.</p>

<p>To Michael C. Scott and a few others berating the BART cop:</p>
<p>There was a time in my life when I would have agreed with you.  But in 2000, for three months, I went through something that the St. Louis City Police Dept had for civilians called the &#8220;Citizens Academy,&#8221; basically a PR program.  However, one night, we all got to use something called a &#8220;firearms simulator,&#8221; basically it&rsquo;s a simulated scenario generator where you use a real-looking gun that can &#8220;fire&#8221; pretend bullets and hit the on-screen person if you hit him, and he can also fire at you and you feel a simulated bullet.  The idea is that real cop trainees use it to cut their teeth on real world scenarios.  After I went through my ten minutes, I figured out how tough cops have it sometimes, b/c this was a fake gun and fake people, they have the real thing.  Also, the &#8220;firearms simulator&#8221; did not include the civil rights industry, the NAACP, the U.S. Justice Department, race hustling politicians and &#8220;community activists&#8221; and Lizz Browns of the world waiting to string you up if you do one little thing bad.</p>
<p>I resolved then to make life as easy as possible for the cop if I&rsquo;m ever in a situation where I&rsquo;m the object of interest to a cop.</p>

			<p>I can report this much concerning the taser/pistol mixup claims; we need to look elsewhere.  All Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputies and police have a pistol on their right hip and their taser on their left.  No jury or reasonable person will buy that this police officer was so shook up that he forgot his left from right.  I am lookingn for some other explanation.  Like many here, I don&rsquo;t think that a man wakes up one morning and decides that today he will shoot a Black youth at the BART station just for kicks.  He absolutely knows the headaches and risks that come with every incident of police caused death.</p>

Although I&rsquo;m not a law enforcement officier my initial impression of what I saw on the video clip and accidental might be due to BART&rsquo;s use of force policy.</p>
<p>Military Police are not allowed to pull out a weapon if they have no intent to discharge it.  In others words if you are an MP you have a justifiable reason to use deadly force before you can even consider pulling out your weapon.</p>
<p>Most civilian police departments however have policies that allow officiers to pull out a weapon in non deadly force situations.  In other words civilian police departments consider pulling out a weapon in and of itself another force level. Just because a civilian policeman can be authorized to pull out a weapon doesn&rsquo;t mean that he is neccisarily justified in using it.  </p>
<p>Although this approach may work in theory the problem in real life is that if an officier is concerned enough to pull out a weapon he will probably be in a very stressful situation.  When your under stress adrenaline levels are high and your very tense, so tense in fact that an accidental discharge may occur.  Think if your confronting someone and you have a gun in your hand while you are under a great a deal of stress its quite possible that you could accidently pull the trigger,even if you have no intention of doing so.</p>
<p>This situation is terrible for both the cops and general public.  For police it means that although they may be legally justified in pulling out a weapon they may not be legally covered when they use it.  The risk to the general public of course injuries and fatalities.</p>
<p>What I suspect happened during the BART riot was this.  Police were confronted with rioters, they have no shields or riot gear.  The officiers are also badly outnumbered.  Its not unreasonable if you are badly outnumbered by a hostile crowd to reach for your weapon.  In this case the officier would probably be justified in deploying pulling out a weapon,although not neccessarily using it.</p>
<p>The officier however is in a tense situation the gun is in his hand, his heart is pumping and he&rsquo;s full of adrenaline.  Before he knows it he&rsquo;s squeezing the trigger and bam,someone has been shot.</p>
<p>Personally I feel that this situation never would have happened if BART had better force policy which specified that the weapon could only be drawn when deadly force is justified.   I suspect that the officier probably followed the rules, but if the rules are don&rsquo;t make sense then people get hurt and killed.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s been said before and it bears repeating: It&rsquo;s paradoxical to almost strange that whenever and wherever a Black riot occurs they always end up trashing THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS!<br>
When, in the event, they begin holding their rage until they travel into a White neighborhood until they unleash it, that&rsquo;s when real resistance and fireworks will begin.</p>
<p>Also, and is it just me, but did we not have race riots of this sort until we gave Blacks their &#8220;rights&#8221; in the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I was a pre-teen, but I remember that for YEARS on the evening news we were treated to some American city burning night after night. Only after they recieved their civil &#8220;rights&#8221; were they violent on a massive scale. LBJ must have been bewildered when after signing these bills, he had so much violence that local city police were overwhelmed and he had to call out the National Guard! What irony! Don&rsquo;t you know that he had to have questioned the wisdom in signing these liberal bills into law? Again, these riots lasted nightly for YEARS.</p>
<p>Since those years, every time an event happens they don&rsquo;t agree with, they go nuts&hellip;burning down their own neighborhoods time and time again. </p>
<p>Can anyone imagine what would have happened if Obama had lost?</p>

			<p>The question I would raise is: &#8220;Why have Whites failed to take protests to the streets?&#8221; Why are there no similar protests against affirmative action and all the rest of the anti-White discrimination in this country? Why is there no citizen protest against illegal immigration? Why, for that matter, is there no protest against the ANC inspired black attacks on White South African farmers? </p>
<p>Rather than clucking tongues at blacks for at least having the guts to take it to the streets when one of their own is killed, perhaps Whites could learn a lesson or three from them? </p>
<p>As for the Revolutionary Communist Party and Black Block (the latter being anarchists, more or less): again, we might ask why are there no similar movements on the right which can radicalize and mobilize Americans? Could we perhaps not learn something from these groups? If such marginalized radicals can raise so much media attention, then perhaps a more militant movement from the right could do the same.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For years there has been some thought of closing down Fruitvale station entirely because of the crowds of thugs hanging around&hellip;Many Bay area residents have suggested that Bart be rebuilt to go around Oakland and Richmond entirely&hellip;&#8221; (Posted by Anonymous at 6:28 PM on January 8)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in the East SF Bay area for 35 years. I don&rsquo;t follow local news very closely, but I&rsquo;ve never heard any mention of these two ideas, and I would be very surprised, considering the very liberal public attitudes here, if there has been ANY public discussion of such ideas at all.</p>
<p>Can you provide any links, or other evidence, to support your two statements?</p>
<p>If I seem to be nit-picking, it&rsquo;s because I like to feel I can have a fair amount of trust in comments I read here based on persons&rsquo; own knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Other parts of your interesting post I found completely believable, and instructive, such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember when Bart was built in the 1970&rsquo;s. Liberals and the media blamed much of the disfunction and crime in Oakland to the fact that it took so long for black Oaklanders to get across the bridges and freeways to jobs. So they built Bart which gets people from Oakland to downtown San Francisco and other job centers. But Oakland blacks are as unemployed, criminal and messed up as they before Bart was built.&#8221;</p>
<p>If not for such a sizable number of blacks here being hostile, and criminal, Berkeley would be a beautiful paradise.</p>

			<p>Whites do protest in the streets on occasion.  They protest over the environment, abortion, foreign policy, politics, and animal rights.  But its never about race.  Forty years of intense, relentless indoctrination have conditioned whites to never defend themselves along racial lines. Conversely, blacks have conditioned themselves to protest only over racial matters. </p>

<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s paradoxical to almost strange that whenever and wherever a Black riot occurs they always end up trashing THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s so handy.  It is right THERE.  It&rsquo;s available. They would have to TRAVEL to a white neighborhood.  Do you imagine that charged-up rioters stop to think logically about these things?   If they did (think logically) they wouldn&rsquo;t riot.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Did we not have race riots of this sort until we gave Blacks their &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I was a pre-teen, but I remember that for YEARS on the evening news we were treated to some American city burning night after night.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The riots came AFTER the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  That&rsquo;s when it all hit the fan.  As we&rsquo;ve seen over the years, the more you give, the more they demand.  There&rsquo;s no such thing as enough.   Now they have the White House.  What will be next?</p>
