			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aislinn Simpson, Telegraph (London), January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain is the least racist country in Europe, Trevor Phillips, the head of Britain&rsquo;s race watchdog, has said.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said that the younger Britons were, the more tolerant they were, thanks to an increasingly racially diverse country where different races meet at school, work and &#8220;even across the breakfast table&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he said some inequalities do still exist for both whites and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there are still problems  &mdash;  racially motivated attacks on immigrants, the lamentable failure of some institutions to move with the times. But I believe that Britain is by far  &mdash;  and I mean by far  &mdash;  the best place to live in Europe if you are not white,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to issues of race, then, this country has a lot to be proud of. When we are at our best, integration works for us because at heart we believe that everyone should be treated with fairness. It&rsquo;s a solid, unflashy, very British sentiment, but it&rsquo;s one of the values that make this country what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his comments on the 10th anniversary of the Macpherson report into the 1993 racially-motivated murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, which labelled the police who bungled the inquiry &#8220;institutionally racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips said the term, which has been the watchword of many a Whitehall department ever since, was now redundant and undermined the work of those fighting racism.</p>
<p>He added that it was a &#8220;badge of shame that has hung over&#8221; the police for the past decade, saying: &#8220;Ten years on, is the accusation still valid? I don&rsquo;t think so. The police have shown a much better understanding of how to deliver a public service that doesn&rsquo;t discriminate just because of the colour of your skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the tenth anniversary should act as a &#8220;watershed moment&#8221; for a new approach to tackling broader inequality and called for a &#8220;grand debate&#8221; on the way Britain approaches the issues of immigration, race and discrimination.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;This new world we live in is about being treated fairly, whoever you are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inequality today is as much to do with whether you are struggling economically as it is to do with the colour of your skin, your gender or your sexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that equality laws, often seen as a way of &#8216;helping&rsquo; under represented groups get a fair crack of the whip, can be as importantly applied to poor, white people (who often feel that no one is on their side) as it can to anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he added that some civil servants still had a &#8220;box-ticking&#8221; approach to inequality laws and some aspirations about promoting equality were yet to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s as if there is a gap between the country we feel we have become, and the country we actually live in,&#8221; he wrote in the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want minorities to succeed, yet they are absent from many of the best jobs. We want women to be equal, yet they are poorly represented in the boardroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want disabled people to be respected, yet they are still often obliged to enter the building through the back door.&#8221;</p>
<p>He will follow his comments with a keynote speech in central London today, marking the 10th anniversary of the Macpherson inquiry.</p>
<p>The EHRC also commissioned research that showed one in 10 children in the UK is now part of a mixed-race family. The study predicted that, if current trends continued, some ethnic minorities may disappear as people from mixed-race backgrounds become increasingly common.<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the most racist place in Europe? My money would be on Russia. Any country that gives an award for making Whites has to have a healthy racial identity. Although I suspect that if you told a Russian you are a White Nationalist they would look at you funny. What else would you be?</p>

<p>Hooray for the British! So, what do they get? A trophy? A check for 10,000 pounds? A special place in Heaven? What&rsquo;s that? They get&hellip;nothing? You mean there is no reward? None? They destroyed their ethnicity, their culture and their country. They participated in a decades long orgy of groveling and self-loathing until one day someone, who is not of them, decided that they had come around? Bah, sounds like a bad deal to me. </p>

Overrun a nation with hundreds of thousands of immigrant arrivals each year, make miscegenation seem &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;trendy&#8221;, claim any expression of British (English especially) heritage as &#8220;racist&#8221; while muzzling free speech and white self-determination attempts via &#8220;Racial Equality&#8221; laws</p>

			<p>These diversity geeks get funnier as the days roll by and the economic juggernaut is slowly grinding nation after nation under its wheels, but the humor lies in the fact that it&rsquo;s as if economic collapse is the least of their worriies.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this Trevor Phillips bragging that the UK is less racist than anybody, whatever that means, yet the Telegraph has a headline blaring about the country being on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/iainmartin/4295219/Gordon-Brown-brings-Britain-to-the-edge-of-bankruptcy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/iainmartin/4295219/Gordon-Brown-brings-Britain-to-the-edge-of-bankruptcy.html</a></p>
<p>Gordon Brown Brings Britain to the Edge of Bankruptcy</p>
<p>&#8220;The country stands on the precipice. We are at risk of utter humiliation, of London becoming a Reykjavik on Thames and Britain going under. Thanks to the arrogance, hubristic strutting and serial incompetence of the Government and a group of bankers, the possibility of national bankruptcy is not unrealistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The political impact will be seismic; anger will rage. The haunted looks on the faces of those in supporting roles, such as the Chancellor, suggest they have worked out that a tragedy is unfolding here. Gordon Brown is engaged no longer in a standard battle for re-election; instead he is fighting to avoid going down in history disgraced completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds pretty grim doesn&rsquo;t it?  But not to good old Trevor.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because to Trevor and those like him, the most important thing in the world&hellip;.in fact the ONLY thing in the world of importance&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; is in making sure there&rsquo;s no bad thoughts and no racism lurking anywhere.</p>

I was reared to be accepting and tolerant. Then I grew up and I had to deal with real people in the real world. Experience trumps conditioning.</p>
<p>Any claim of a victory over racial awareness is shaky, tentative, and conditional.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s forget for a moment the inherent conflict of interest that Mr. Phillips is in.</p>
<p>The question that the egalitatarians like Mr. Phillips never seem to answer is this: If diversity and multiculturalism are good, why must differences be &#8220;tolerated&#8221;?</p>
<p>Once again, the truth is between the lines, and yes, even the egalitarians confirm the obvious; differences must be tolerated.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Of course, there are still problems &mdash; racially motivated attacks on immigrants&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.funny neither the government nor the British media ever report the increasing number of vicious attacks buy immigrants on the indigenous British population&hellip;..<br>
nor the bias against indigenous British workers in the jobs market.</p>
<p>The real racism is practised by the British Labour government against it&rsquo;s own people.  I suggest readers follow the website of the British National Party if they want to get a hint of the actual situation.   bnp.org.uk</p>

			<p>Without racism, a nation is doomed. Racism is necessary to keep a nation intact. If the British were racist, they would never have tolerated non-white foreigners moving to their country. If  whites in Britain are the least racist in Europe, then they will win the race to be the first European nation to become majority non-white. They must be very proud.</p>

			<p>Actually I find young peoples racism more sincere. Its not a generic cultural opinion but an underlying intellectual acknowledgement something must be done. We are the ones who were subjected to the propaganda but decide to formulate our own opinions. I think Trevor is worried about the current collapse of the pound and inevitable bankruptcy of Britian. He should be worried.<br>
I agree though that Eastern Europe is the place to follow, real hostility to the black man on a street level.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;least racist&#8221; &hellip;only because of their draconian &#8220;hate laws&#8221; that hang over English heads to force compliance to state-sponsored edicts designed to diminish the indigenous peoples of Britain!  </p>
<p>As the new U.S. president is black (13% of pop.), Canada&rsquo;s Governor-General (appointed representative of the Queen) is a black immigrant (2% of pop.), and needless to say, Britain&rsquo;s race watchdog, Trevor Phillips is black, so it appears the <i>new world orderlies</i> are doing a splendid job in breaking apart majority white nation-states. </p>

			<p>Britian is now financially bankrupt.  Does this maybe have to something to do with them being morally and ethnically bankrupt?  First they lost their empire, then they lost their pride, now they shall disappear under of sea of self-hatred. Whoa, poor Britain, may you rise again. </p>

			<p>Trevor Phillips, the black immigrant boss of the all-powerful neo-Stalinist &#8220;Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission&#8221; (equality and human rights for all, except indigenous white males) says that - suddenly, literally out of the blue - the evil, vicious, racist, white fascists of the UK have become all pink and fluffy and simply love multi-culti. </p>
<p>Nope. Sorry, and all that, Comrade Trevor, but you are very wrong. We beleaguered whites are hardening our attitdes very, very quickly. </p>
<p>Watch how the BNP performs in May&rsquo;s European Parliament elections. Watch how the BNP performs in the General Election, whenever the gutless unelected traitor Gordon Brown decides to call one.</p>
<p>Anger here is growing very, very quickly. Virtually everybody I speak to now knows the country has been betrayed on an epic scale. The most common comment I hear is &#8220;This country&rsquo;s f****d&#8221;.</p>
<p>The rapid decline of our economy, burgeoning mass unemployment, the collapse of sterling, skyrocketing government debt and the very real prospect of national bankruptcy will only add gasoline to the fire. When whites are shaken out of their consumerist stupor - i.e., no more jobs, pensions, easy credit, easy mortgages, 50 inch LCD televisions, new cars, vacations in Florida - they will act.</p>
<p>Britain, as we knew it, is finished. It will never return. But do not write off all the white British - particularly the white English - because they will, eventually, fight back. It won&rsquo;t be pretty.</p>
<p>It may be a percentage of these isles are secured for our people. It may be that we fail. Perhaps the US military will invade and occupy the UK to assure the dispossession of the whites. That scenario looks ever more likely; after all, the US is now a Third World country with a powerful military.    </p>
<p>But be assured: the chances of nothing happening here are ZERO.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s the trick right there:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve rewritten the definition of racism (for whites)to include patriotism, love of one&rsquo;s culture and one&rsquo;s desire to preserve that culture.</p>
<p>True racism is outright verbal and physical violence against an innocent person purely because of his or her ethnicity.</p>

			<p>When most White Brits are over 40, and most non-whites are under 40, of course it is going to seem this way. Today&rsquo;s young white British people are minorities in their own nation. This Trevor character wants the remaining young whites to mix with foreigners, so that one day the few remaining indigenous people will vanish forever. I am sick of his propaganda. It&rsquo;s a form of brainwashing.</p>

			<p>Who knows what young Britons really think? What they know is that the wrong phrase or even the wrong word at the wrong time can ruin their career chances, in effect ruining their lives. So they regurgitate the lies they&rsquo;ve been force-fed. But you can&rsquo;t teach whites to love or even like non-whites. We naturally, and literally for reasons of survival, distrust the other. </p>

			<p>Common sense would indicate that the least racist country in Europe would be the most racially homogeneous. A country like Belarus would have less racial antagonism then the invaded and accosted indigenous British Whites. By the way, does Britain get some kind of &#8220;trophy cup&#8221; for this? I don&rsquo;t see what the British gain for this beyond some congratulatory slap on the back for their &#8220;tolerance&#8221; (other words like &#8216;sheep&rsquo; come to my mind). They are being robbed and dispossesed of their country, culture, heritage and birthright.</p>

Repentence is not enough Trev. Its not sellable. If you have been assigned by your PM for this PR excercise he will be disappointed to find that you are the wrong wizard for the job.<br>
In not too long the UK may end up at the top othe European trash pile and may NOT attract too many &#8216;tourists&rsquo;.<br>
I would not be that optimistic.<br>

Once again, Anonymous makes perfect sense.  It reasons that the more races you have, the more race-conscious people will be. </p>
<p>Of course, that argument is not going to serve the purpose of this black  racial commissar who has his own personal agenda to pursue.</p>
