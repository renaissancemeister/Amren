<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7857515.stm">Asia Migrants Flock to Australia</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Australia&rsquo;s Asian population is soaring as immigrants from across the region  &mdash;  particularly China and India  &mdash;  enter the country, official data suggests.</p>
<p>Asia is fast becoming a rival to Europe as the dominant source of arrivals, analysis of the latest census showed.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics said almost one-fifth of the new arrivals in Australia between 1996 and 2006 came from China and India.</p>
<p>The data also showed that 4.4 million people in Australia were born overseas.</p>
<p>This represented a 2% increase from the time of the last census in 1996.</p>
<p>Until 1973 the former British colony had a &#8220;White Australia&#8221; policy, restricting immigration to Westerners.</p>
<p>While migration from Europe has continued, the ABS report, entitled Portrait of a Nation, said the overseas-born population had &#8220;featured a major increase in Asian immigration&#8221;.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was still the most common country of origin, with 24% of foreign-born residents (92,000) arriving from there between 1996 and 2006, census data suggested.</p>
<p>However, six of the 10 most common birthplaces were now Asian countries with China accounting for 9.5% (62,000) of new arrivals and India with 8.4% (54,100).</p>
<p>Other Asian countries where migrants were coming from included Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea.</p>
<p>The report said that the Asian population has now eclipsed that of indigenous Australians.<br>

			<p>Australians are really screwing the pooch by letting in hordes of Asians, especially Chinese and Indians. They do not have to look very far to find examples of societies that have been virtually taken over by Indian or Chinese immigrants. </p>

			<p>People who commend Asian immigration to Australia because of their IQ advantage should also take note that eugenics was once popular there and in other White countries before multiculturists and relativists swept common sense into a corner. </p>
<p>Also, even though Chinese-Australians may be flattered by Rushton, Lynn, Murray etc. I doubt any would support a pro-eugenic birth control plan. They are not going to support anything that gives native white Australians a leg up.</p>
<p>Think of what pro-high IQ family policies Australia would have in place if people like Jared Taylor had a say.</p>

			<p>Asian immigration is going to be a HUGE issue for Australia in the near future. I would give it another 10-15 years, if nothing is done before then, there are going to be tears. Around where I live they have already bought out so many businesses and properties it is frightening. Australia really is going to end up having an Asian ruling class.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Until 1973 the former British colony had a &ldquo;White Australia&rdquo; policy, restricting immigration to Westerners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Australia has become an Asian colony, with an immigration policy which implicitly favours Asians.</p>
<p>At this rate, traditional Anglo-Celtic Australia will soon be nothing but a fading memory.</p>

<p>   Look no further than the Fiji Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. </p>

			<p>Australia is keeping up with Canada on the road to self elimation.</p>
<p>Funny vid from Oz here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJFIwf_KsJc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJFIwf_KsJc</a></p>
<p>What stands out the most however is that this is a train full of &#8220;Australians&#8221;.</p>

			<p>One consequence of this legal Asian immigration is to provide a &#8220;screen&#8221; for illegals to move around in. Think how conspicuous illegal Pakistanis would have been in Australia in, say 1969?</p>

<p>This is nonsense.  Non-whites are harmful to white societies whatever their religion.  </p>

<p>We people know that they hate us, well not all of them of course, but the extermists at least.<br>
The Bali Bombings were like our little 9/11, 202 people killed, 88 of them Australia the rest Bristish, German, American, Swiss, New Zealnders (various Westerners)and some locals.</p>
<p>And images like these of the bombers smiling and getting patted on the back by members of the Indonesian military angered alot of us here.<br>
<a href="https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=bxa4a82mAbA&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=bxa4a82mAbA&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>And when they were finally executed they just became martyrs.<br>
<a href="https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=XcuTlN110gY" rel="nofollow">https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=XcuTlN110gY</a></p>
<p>Of course a whole lot of our liberals (priests and the like) came out the woodwork to oppose the executions, but I think the lack of remorse on the part of the bombers gave the grieving families some relief.</p>
<p>The terrorist organisation J.I.[1] membership reportedly went up after the excutions. J.I. members are closely linked to Al-Qaeda having some sort of exchange program with trainers and members going back and forth from Indonesia to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve even found them training here in Oz [2] &amp; [3].<br>
There&rsquo;s 300 million of them and 21 million of us. And our military has something like 20,000 and theirs, I think I heard has a one million members. <br>
So within our little cold war alot of our military strategy is around having long range stategic bombers and a state of the art submarine fleet and I believe we have the edge. To immobilise their troop carriering ships at least, and our fighter pilots train regularly with yours and I think their airforce is somewhat out of date.<br>
But politically things are alot less tense now with John Howard and G.W having moved on. Now we have a very liberal Chinese speaking leader and you have a super liberal Indonesian speaking leader.<br>
<a href="https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=RsFgUlVt30c" rel="nofollow">https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=RsFgUlVt30c</a><br>
But in saying that you&rsquo;d know better than anyone the war against militant Islam is never ending [4]. <br>
And when the U.N. with 1/3 Muslim membership has trouble agreeing on what terrorism actually is&hellip;.<br>

I can&rsquo;t things changing that much.</p>

<p>I remember being told, while in the Army in Viet-Nam, that we could not take R&R; in Australia because the Australians would not let black G.I.s off the aircraft. To bad that all changed.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s an English language test you have to take to before you can move to Australia. It&rsquo;s really difficult I&rsquo;ve heard. This could be why most of the immigrates&rsquo; are Asian. </p>
