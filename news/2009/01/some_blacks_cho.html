<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28661596/">Some Blacks Choose Inauguration Over Work</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asante Bradford gave his bosses nearly three months notice that he would not be at his desk on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>A day after Barack Obama&rsquo;s historic presidential win, Bradford knew he wanted to be able to whoop it up when Obama was sworn in as the nation&rsquo;s first black chief executive  &mdash;  and that he couldn&rsquo;t do that at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided if I couldn&rsquo;t be (in Washington D.C.), I&rsquo;m just going to take the day off, just so I can scream and holler,&#8221; said Bradford, 40, who works for the state of Georgia as a liaison to the entertainment industry. He plans to watch the festivities at home with friends.</p>
<p>People across the country may notice the absence of their black colleagues and classmates on Inauguration Day, as many who won&rsquo;t be traveling to Washington gather at homes, restaurants and churches, huddle around TVs and watch the historic swearing in from afar. And while the ceremony itself will only last a few hours, the entire day offers a chance to reflect and rejoice in the moment.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Being at work is not an option&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Being at work is not an option,&#8221; said Brenda Wilson, a 51-year-old manager at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta who abandoned her dreams of heading to Washington but will not be in the office. &#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get any work done, wondering what was going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming a day after the federal observance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s birthday  &mdash;  many black Americans deem the day as something of a holiday requiring cultural solidarity, much like the Million Man March or the first King holiday in 1986. Then as now, many black people felt compelled to miss work, said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some businesses, particularly those with a large number of black employees, will accommodate workers, realizing the significance of the day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Volunteering that day with students</b></p>
<p>Many from there will spend at least part of their day at a boys&rsquo; charter school in Atlanta, watching the ceremony with about 175 sixth- and seventh-graders, including quite a few who will interrupt their workdays to volunteer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, headquartered in Baltimore will stay open, though employees will likely pause to watch the events.</p>
<p>Morehouse College, the renowned historically black institution in Atlanta, has not canceled classes but will offer a campus viewing for students and faculty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>History unfolding live on TV</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is history unfolding live, said Williams [Bari A. Williams, a corporate attorney], 28. &#8220;It&rsquo;s one of those &#8216;Where were you?&rsquo; moments that you&rsquo;ll discuss all of your life. This is the real New Year&rsquo;s Eve to me and all of my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>While thousands of blacks are expected to make the pilgrimage to the capital for the long inauguration weekend, others were convinced by the cold temperatures, high price tag and big crowds to stay put.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More introspective than jubilant</b></p>
<p>Instead, Gary is watching at home  &mdash;  alone. She said she doesn&rsquo;t want to repeat her Election Night mistake of watching with friends.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You can understand why people actually want to pay attention to Obama taking the oath, to want to hear Aretha Franklin sing. That makes it very different than Election Night,&#8221; Neal said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a much more reflective moment.&#8221;<br>

			<p>And if their employment has some acute rule prohibiting their absence next Tuesday, will the supervisors punish them for being absent?  The answer is the no of all nos.</p>
<p>Though anyone who would not go to work in order to watch BHO being inaugurated probably wouldn&rsquo;t be missed that much anyway.</p>

			<p>Black &#8220;progress&#8221; in the United States is artifically produced at the expense of Whites.</p>
<p>That nearly half of White voters chose Barack Hussein Obama as president, strongly suggests to me that the return of the White race in the USA is far short of materializing any time soon.</p>

			<p>Blacks had a Million Man March, another one 4 years ago, a fake black holiday called Kwannza, MLK Day, and now a black president.  So?  What has having these things accomplished?  Their communities are filled with crime, gangstas, drugs, poverty, and their out-of-wedlock birth rate is over 70%.</p>

			<p>Didn`t even read it, but I have no problem with this. I am a firm believer in reflection and pondering the forks and road left ahead and paying attention to the personal and larger than life moments that trigger and demand such reflection. No matter what race.Just know  that these events have triggered my own reflections&hellip;. Thank you, I think?!?</p>

			<p>At my small school, all the black teachers and the one black administrator  &mdash;  a total of 5 staff, are taking off. They are not actually going to the inaguration,they are going to &#8220;church-sponsored&#8221; events. The white teachers will be working that day. During the latest faculty meeting, there was discussion as to how to present this ceremony to the students. After much dithering and debate, I, the newby, suggested that they review what they had done four years ago. Turns out they hadn&rsquo;t done squat. </p>

<p>I wonder what this man&rsquo;s qualifications were for such a position?  That he has watched movies?  What I got from this article is that thousands of Affirmative Descrimination workers will sit home and watch as an Affirmative Descrimination President is sworn in.</p>

<p>Is she ever &#8220;really&#8221; there engaging in a lucrative function for her organization, anyway? Or does she sit with the &#8220;girls,&#8221; chatting for around 5 morning hours, about how Oprah and Dr. Phil looked vivacious on Monday, but worn on Friday? Or maybe it was the &#8220;all important&#8221; latest national &#8220;talent&#8221; show, that helped the 8 donuts and 10 cups of coffee go down?</p>
<p>That is before the filthy Mau Mau/Red heifers and homos discuss an even more important topic: &#8216;Will it be Burger King or Taco Bell today girls?&rsquo; Maybe a nap after that, followed by 1 to 2 hours of &#8220;real&#8221; work?</p>

			<p>You have to understand the mind of the &#8220;African-American&#8221; to really appreciate just why this Obama coronation&hellip;er, inauguration is such a big deal. Symbolism is like unto religion for American Blacks. Any symbolic Black &#8220;victory&#8221; is bigger than the actual substance of the event by far. In fact symbolism or style over substance is practically an unspoken pillar of the Black experience! <br>
Thus, all this hoopla is just one big orgy of sybolism - the very super-bowl of it for Blacks!! Whatver happens afterward is really a lot less important. Which is fortunate for Obama, as he cannot possibly live up to the ridiculous hype surrounding his victory. </p>
<p>Several years from now, when Blacks are still clogging the prison system, lagging hopelessly behind in academics, and continuing to embody human failure, it should be interesting to see how they perceive this &#8220;magic moment&#8221; in hindsight. The only thing more powerful to Blacks than symbolism is their perpetual resentment and jealousy!</p>

			<p>Will this have the same effect as the &#8220;Day Without Mexicans&#8221; who all took off work? I didn&rsquo;t notice any difference if they were there or not. In fact it was alot quieter and we got MORE done without them in the workplace. I cannot believe the dumbed down mentality of those who voted for him in the first place, let alone even want to watch his inaguration. I am so sick of hearing and listening to Obama this and Obama that, I want to tear my hair out. He is not good for this country, let alone becoming the President of the USA. It will be a day of mourning for me.</p>

They think that day and his whole Presidency will be like spring break for blacks down in Daytona Beach, FL or that fright night weekend that&rsquo;s here in Atlanta once a year. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one of those, &#8216;Where were you?&rsquo; moments&#8221;<br>
I heard plenty of blacks&rsquo; response to 9/11. &#8216;That doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>You may think you&rsquo;re being a little bit glib about black symbolism and hoopla rather than substance of the afterward, but you don&rsquo;t know how right you are   &mdash;   black funerals tend to be gawdy and mind-blowing affairs that cost a lot, but black cemeteries are very badly maintained and allowed to run down. </p>

<p>&#8220;Shaun(the female)&#8221; No doubt you are right. But it will be just another manifestation of the symbolic &#8220;struggle&#8221; we are supposed to believe plagues Blacks everywhere and anywhere for all time. &#8220;Obama could have delivered us from evil&#8221; they will wail&hellip;&#8221;but dat &#8216;ol debbil Whitey wouldn&rsquo;t give him an inch.&#8221; And thus, another chapter in the mythological Black &#8220;struggle&#8221; is born!  </p>

Obama hasn&rsquo;t even been sworn in yet and everyone I know as well as myself are sick sick sick of the constant news coverage of Obama and BLACK president!  How come he isn&rsquo;t just PRESIDENT? My whole life all I have heard is how blacks want to be accepted into the norm and be part of American society!  Now it is BLACK THIS AND BLACK THAT!  I have been pushed from an &#8220;ignore them&#8221; to an &#8220;hate them&#8221; position.  Wonder how many thousands of other people have this same attitude now? The American press, the DC leadership are pushing their limits on what is going to be accepted and what is going to push the majority over the line!  I myself is about to fall over the line!</p>

			<p>The worst four years in the history of the United States may be coming up folks.  Trouble in the Middle East right now and this is what Joe Biden probably meant when he warned us that something was coming up to test the great Black Hope - Obama.  No problem though.  Nothing he does will be given it&rsquo;s true criticism.  His spending package that is supposed to &#8216;lift&rsquo; the economy will have the opposite effect, the country will mostly likely spiral further down into a depression and the evil White Man will be blamed for it.  Obama will merely have inherited what George Bush gave us, that&rsquo;s all!  Can&rsquo;t blame Hussein for that!  And the riots, Oh they be comin&rsquo;!  They be comin&rsquo;!</p>

			<p>Where I work, the blacks do little more than goof off, with their biggest concern being where they&rsquo;re going to go for lunch that day (do they ever brown bag it?).  The fact that they won&rsquo;t be in will just make the day that more productive for those of us who do work. These people will use any excuse to get out of work. Think back to how many &#8220;working&#8221; blacks &#8220;had to&#8221; take election day off to vote. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those &lsquo;Where were you?&rsquo; moments that you&rsquo;ll discuss all of your life. This is the real New Year&rsquo;s Eve to me and all of my friends.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The elephant in the room question in this article is, why are blacks so jubilant about this one president, out of all presidents in history? Is it not merely because he is partially black?  Yet it&rsquo;s wrong for whites to celebrate someone merely because he&rsquo;s white. </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whites have not been oppressed through history like blacks have,&#8221; I can hear the leftists rationalize.</p>
<p>Then why are so few blacks interested in returning to Africa, where presumably, these oppressive whites don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve become too conditioned by life over here to do that&#8221; comes the next rationalization.</p>
<p>Then why are so many Africans, even though conditioned to life in Africa, so desirous of coming to America?</p>
<p>This is the way it always is. The left has built up so many rationalizations to excuse every dysfunctional aspect of black behavior that it&rsquo;s like chipping away at a mountain every time we want to have a discussion. But chip away we must.</p>

			<p>   I used to think we lived in a democratic country where the president was first citizen. Boy was I wrong! This inauguration has all the extravagant trappings of a royal coronation. Normally, the Roman emperors were dead before they were deified, but not always. The country is in crisis and nearly bankrupt, and yet we continue to ignore reality and &#8220;celebrate&#8221; like there is no tomorrow  &mdash;  maybe there isn&rsquo;t?</p>

			<p>Honestly, I can&rsquo;t see why this is a big deal.</p>
<p>Sure, blacks are acting ridiculous and over-celebrating a rather minor event (what else is new?), but the simple fact that they&rsquo;re taking off of work on Tuesday doesn&rsquo;t seem all that unusual, or even wrong in any way.</p>
<p>People take days off of work for all kinds of stupid and unnecessary reasons. If I can get through the winter without losing any days due to inclement weather, I plan to take a vacation day on Wednesday, March 18th, for no reason other than so I can drink way too much Guinness, Smithwick&rsquo;s and Beamish the night before in commemoration of Ireland&rsquo;s favorite medieval Italian.</p>
<p>Is there any real religious or or cultural significance of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to me? Nope. The Emerald Isle? I&rsquo;ve never even been there (though it&rsquo;s on my to-do list). But I&rsquo;m going to take the day off so I can sleep one off anyway.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to talk about blacks&rsquo; hysteria over Obama, it just seems to me that we can find better examples of it than this.</p>

			<p>Question diversity,</p>
<p>I worked a week at a funeral home while my older brother, who had the job, went on vacation. Nothing but cleaning up the place and answering the phone. I was 15 but I will never forget a black mortician coming for a visit and stating he had three bodies he cannot do anything with? He said with black folks, you have to get the money in the first day or so because after the emotions wear off they do not claim the person!  Blew me away.</p>
<p>Thank God I&rsquo;m White!</p>

			<p>I see an article on CNN today that &#8220;hate watch experts&#8221; are monitoring &#8220;supremecist&#8221; websites and such.  They likely consider Amren such a site.  So while they are reading this I would like to ask them why they are only interested in &#8220;hate&#8221; talk when Whites speak of their concerns in a nation whose government agencies have been actively working against them for nearly four decades.  And I would like to ask them why a crime is likely a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime when it is interracial unless the victims are White?</p>
<p>The article also cites the attack on Blacks by three Whites on Election night last November.  But it doesn&rsquo;t cite the numerous comments and problems with Blacks that night, one of whom proclaimed that she could do anything now, because a Black man was now in charge.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they notic the way our Orwellian beaurucrats have managed to make the term &#8220;racism&#8221; a crime for its object, and with it an implied trial and conviction?  Don&rsquo;t they notice that the term &#8220;hate&#8221; have not been uniformly implied and a myth that only the perceived majority Whites can act in hate?  Don&rsquo;t they realize that this has been done purely for political gain with little justification?  Don&rsquo;t they realize that injustices done on us for continually trumpted up cases of alleged injustices done to them long ago does not equal justice?</p>
<p>These government policies and the insiduous way they have worked in concert to destroy our communities and peaceful lives has a limit.  </p>
<p>They are watching &#8220;supremecists&#8221; for violent acts, claiming they are monitoring, just like a conspiracy seeking to repress a group would.  But they will not act to stop the groups and trends like La Raza, who once they have gained political power, make accusations of hate and infiltrate those same government agencies that hired them in their initial drive to take from Whites rather than require non-Whites to actually EARN their way into success.  So as we loose our economic power, we loose political power.</p>
<p>A bunch of text messaging Bevis and Buttheads got Obama elected, no one else.  I hope he will do more good than harm.  But I can&rsquo;t imagine much will get done when the media has engaged in a solicitous &#8220;Black History Month&#8221; for the last year.  All it seems we have to look forward to is four years of &#8220;Black History Month&#8221; while various experiements are tried out on our declining society.  </p>
<p>Obama will never guess and neither will the Left, that in destroying the White majority politically and culturally, the means to save this nation from chaos will disappeared.  That job is almost done.  Unless Whites are brought back into the center of the nations concern, all efforts will fail.  They haven&rsquo;t got the time to actually breed us out, even though that is clearly a strategy.  I caught Gwen Ifil last night proclaiming that many offices in State and local governments were &#8220;full of Obama&rsquo;s.&#8221; In saying this, she has exposed the plan; 14% of our population will soon be governing America as proclaimed Blacks in power, Ifil said it.  So it is a given that they must persue the complete abandonment of Whites - especially White men, in order to hold onto and expand their gaining power.  As they do that, they will loose their best minds and a large if not the majority of the national population - at least as participating citizenry.  </p>
<p>The article also pointed out that &#8220;Supremecist&#8221; sites crashed on Election night because so many people were visiting them.  That means something.  We can&rsquo;t say exactly what it means, but I think we can guess that a larger number of people were alarmed by Obama&rsquo;s campaign with its &#8220;rock concert&#8221; - even Nuremburg Rally qualities, paid for with money gained by renegging on a promise to abide by campiagn finance reform guidelines, to beat the man who worked so many years to make elections more honest.  That is the epitome of irony.  The contrast was epic, an untried politcian with a superior marketing plan and the money to implement it and with little actual experience and a questionable background, gets away with changing his stripes whenever it is convenient politically - contrasted against a man with from an outstanding American family with a long record of public service and in particular fighting political corruption.  A man who endured the unimaginable in service to his nation and fellow Americans.  He was humiliated as an &#8220;old coot&#8221; who just wasn&rsquo;t cool enough to be president.</p>
<p>But the hate groups watchdogs are concerned that some White Americans might be angry over this bitter disgrace. At least they acknowledge that we have the right to be upset and express it and discuss the situation, but with these new texts to determine if you are a &#8220;racist&#8221; and the growing trend to invade our freedom of conscious, how long will it be before it will be a crime to flunk such as test?  What will be the cure, Re-education Camp?  They already have Diversity Training and Cultural Sensitivity Training.  They amount to brainwashing sessions and are required in many situaitons today.  Our public schools are brainwashing centers, not educational instituations.</p>
<p>They ought to guess that many of us will begin to isolate ourselves like the Amish or even the FLDS.  These online discussion panels are just the beginning of the movement of many Whites away from the rest of America.</p>

			<p>Inauguration Day (Obama Day) might be a lost cause, but here&rsquo;s the more interesting problem:  What about days after then?  Will there be a percentage of black workers who think they&rsquo;ll never have to work again because BHO is President?  What will the reaction be if they&rsquo;re eventually fired?  Will they be fired?  What would be the tipping point (in terms of number of days not coming to work) will an employer get fed up?</p>

			<p>What a great bunch of comments!</p>
<p>Well, dey be in charge ne, so step aside!</p>
<p>For the past year we have been subjected to a twelve month &#8220;Black History Month.&#8221;  The next four years will be &#8220;Black History Month.&#8221;  I cannot imagine much actually getting done with such a big distraction.  But I wonder how much will &#8220;get done&#8221; clandestinely while that distraction is playing for the next four years.  &#8220;Bread and Circuses,&#8221; we are going to entertained with PC programing like never before.  This country may well emerge on the other end as a social state, run by Black polititions and certain of our government departments.  </p>
<p>The barbarians are in Rome.  Gwen Ifil commented last night on a CNN show - (Larry King?) how there are &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s everywhere&#8221; in State and local governments and more coming out of colleges and especially law schools.  She implied that soon Blacks will be over-represented in all political offices and that they will act in the interest of Blacks.  I can&rsquo;t believe how she and so many Blacks get away with overt racism on the media while even a whisper of Whites wishing to re-claim anything is a need for hate watches and objections from various MSM galleries.</p>

			<p>Note to Thank God I&rsquo;m White!: About 45 years ago, an educated and intelligent Black told me that undertakers were often the richest people in Black communities. They had a simple rule: The deceased is not buried until the undertaker is paid in full. He said that they were almost always paid. If not, they sold the body to a medical school.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the only important thing about black presidents:  Africa is full of them.  I was going to elaborate on that, but it seems unnecessary.  </p>
<p>I will add this, though: Hello, FBI folks.  No doubt at least some of you will still be visting (on your own time) after the inauguration is over.  You probably have some great stories; we&rsquo;d like to hear them.  Seriously.<br>

			<p>In 2002, TriState Crematory in northwest Georgia was in the news. Over 300 bodies had been buried instead of cremated, with concrete dust given to the dead&rsquo;s loved ones. I remember a black man was at the center of this news. The only customers/victims that I saw where white. </p>

			<p>A supreme irony in this article is that the blacks quoted as saying that they will take the day off for the inauguration probably represent the top quartile of the black intelligentsia!  These workers had the foresight to plan for a day off work!</p>
<p>It has been proven with experiments that blacks have very poor impulse control, poor delayed gratification and cannot project the consequences of their actions into the future.  I would stake every dollar I have that the majority of black workers will simply not show up for work that day whether or not they have applied for time off.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Being at work is not an option,&rdquo; nor, was it ever.<br>
  <br>
Well, let us take a view at the upcoming week:</p>
<p>Sunday (Football Day)-This will be a day of watching many blacks run up and down a field engaged in casing a ball, thus, screaming, hitting, speaking a strange conglomeration of English as pre-game, during the game, and post-game interviews are conducted, etc.  </p>
<p>Monday (MLK Day)-This will be a day of watching many blacks march up and down streets screaming, hitting, speaking a strange conglomeration of English as pre-march, during the march, and post-march interviews are conducted, etc.  Concerning this day, one might hear a hymn or two dealing with the concept of being able to overcome.    </p>
<p>Tuesday (Inauguration Day)-Again, this will be a day of watching many blacks march up and down streets screaming, hitting, speaking a strange conglomeration of English as pre-inauguration, during the inauguration, and post-inauguration interviews are conducted, etc.  Now, truly, not much difference in Monday and Tuesday as far as application goes.  </p>
<p>Wednesday (Reflection Day)-Much Ripple consumed.</p>
<p>Thursday (Contemplation Day)-Much Malt Liquor consumed.  As in the case of Monday and Tuesday, once again, not much difference in Wednesday and Thursday as far as overall application goes.</p>
<p>Friday (Cultural Solidarity Day)-Much of what was consumed on Reflection Day and Contemplation Day is regurgitated on Cultural Solidarity Day.  Simply, cannot be at work on Cultural Solidarity Day; don&rsquo;t feel like it.  A person hoping to hear hymns on this day will be greatly disappointed.     </p>
<p>To be put in perspective, no more than a normal week of perceived toil will, actually, take place.       <br>

			<p>Let them take the day off from work&hellip; Because one sure bet is that there will NEVER BE ANOTHER BLACK AMERICAN PRESIDENT! It is virtually predictable, Obama won&rsquo;t be able to accomplish a fraction of what he promised. The result being Americans, Blakc OR White will be disillusioned within two years. Obama will be voted out in 2012, like Jimmy Carter, and the Dems will have an albatross on their necks keeping them out of power for decades. A good side-effect being even Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential aspirations will fall flat.</p>

			<p>I got laid off after 28 1/2 years, needing 30 to retire. I NEVER missed work. Now I am older, and every potential employer I try to contact trumpets its Diversity policy in my face (Translation: &#8220;old-white-men-like-me- need-not-apply&#8221;). Today, it would be an honor to have a job to go to- on inauguration day or any other day. Those people who do have jobs, yet do not want to work- truly bewilder me.  For all who posted here, I say Thank You. Your writings confirm that I am not alone.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;If I lived in a majority black country, and a white man was elected president for the first time, I&rsquo;d want to celebrate, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I lived in a majority black country, and a white man was elected president, I&rsquo;d keep very quiet and look for a safe place to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry   &mdash;   neither of you have to ever worry about that scenario taking place   &mdash;   you will NEVER see a white man rise to power in a black dominated country as long as those blacks are  in control of the nation. They are far too racist to ever allow that to happen. </p>

			<p>With MLK Day on Monday, with the Obama Coronation on Tuesday, with Black History Month(s) right behind, that surely is a sufficient excuse for a two-week binge, or at least till the money runs out. Whichever comes first.</p>
