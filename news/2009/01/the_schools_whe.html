<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1130077/The-schools-NO-pupils-speak-English-language.html">The Schools Where NO Pupils Speak English As a First Language</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Slack, Daily Mail (London), January 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are now ten schools in England without a single pupil who speaks English as his or her first language.</p>
<p>Research reveals that there are almost 600 primary schools where 70 per cent or more of youngsters normally speak a foreign language.</p>
<p>Across the country, one in seven pupils aged 4-11 does not have English as the first language, which is the equivalent of 466,620 children.</p>
<p>But, following years of unprecedented levels of migration, ten schools have now reached a point where every youngster falls into this category.</p>
<p>Their locations range from London to Lancashire. One, St Hilda&rsquo;s in Oldham, is a Church of England school.</p>
<p>Some schools are in areas with long-established Muslim populations. In others, the high number of non-English speakers is the consequence of large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Labour MP Frank Field and Tory MP Nicholas Soames, co-chairmen of the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration, said: &#8216;These figures make a nonsense of the Government&rsquo;s aim of integration and show the very real strain that uncontrolled large scale immigration is already placing upon our society.</p>
<p>&#8216;In hundreds of primary schools, English is the second language for over 70 per cent or more of the pupils.</p>
<p>&#8216;How can these children be expected to integrate into our society if they are being taught in schools where is English is the mother tongue of no pupils or a minority of pupils?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Field asked the Children&rsquo;s Department to produce a list of all those schools where seven in ten or more pupils did not have English as their first language.</p>
<p>The 591 primary schools out of 17,205 which fall into this category represent around three per cent, or around one in 30.</p>
<p>There are a number of local authorities where 20 per cent or more of their schools have at least 70 per cent of youngsters who do not have English as their first language.</p>
<p>These include the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets (62 per cent), Newham (46.9), Brent (28.8) and Ealing (28), plus Blackburn (26.7), Leicester (25.9), Bradford (25), Luton (20.3) and Birmingham (20).</p>
<p>Shadow immigration minister Damian Green said: &#8216;Two successful elements of any immigration policy should be to limit the numbers coming in so that the pressure on all public services is reduced, and to insist on English being spoken to a competent level by people coming here to get married.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is relatively easy to cope with a small number of non-English speakers, but incredibly difficult if there are large numbers. Scale matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, has warned that when a large number of immigrant children go into schools, it is very hard for the staff to accommodate them and specialist teachers have to be brought in.</p>
<p>Last night, Dr Green said that when the Government was advocating the economic benefits of mass migration, it failed to take into account the impact on schools and other public services.</p>
<p>He warned that one of the consequences of having schools where no pupils had English as a first language was that they and their families might lead a sectarian lifestyle.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Children&rsquo;s Department said: &#8216;It is important to remember that some of the schools with 100 per cent of their pupils with English as an additional language are actually doing very well, especially considering the extra challenges they face.</p>
<p>&#8216;Even if a pupil speaks another language they may still be highly competent in English, and many are. In cases recent arrivals from countries such as Poland have helped keep small rural schools open that may have otherwise closed because of falling pupil numbers.</p>
<p>&#8216;The language of instruction in English schools is English and this is vital in boosting community cohesion.</p>
<p>&#8216;The task is to get every child up to speed in English so that they can access the whole curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have listened to the concerns of head teachers and are increasing funding in the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant to £206million by 2010, to bring students weak in English up to speed.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>Kids learn English from other kids, not from teachers. A desire to fit in and be accepted by one&rsquo;s peers is what drives them to learn English. A friend of mine moved from China to Vancouver, Canada when she was a small child. She now speaks incredibly fluent English. However, she says that kids in Vancouver today have no chance. There are so many immigrant kids in the schools that you can make friends much more readily if you speak Cantonese than if you speak English. That&rsquo;s what happens when immigrants dominate a city - no need to integrate period.</p>

<p>There was a story floating around on American Renaissance, or another similiar site, where a Polish academic in Britain had found evidence that - despite the BBC&rsquo;s painting of &#8220;most immigrants to Britain from 1990 onwards being either Polish, or Eastern European&#8221; in the abysmal &#8220;White Week&#8221; series - less than 10% had come from Eastern Europe alone, the majority (surprise, surprise) coming from non-white countries.</p>

			<p>Yeah, the LibLabCons genuinely care SO MUCH about the native white British. *sarcasm*</p>
<p>This couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the British National Party just missing in the elections by single digits, could it? <br>

			<p>The labour party will prove again that people have short memories, are gullible and will again elect the party that is securing their demise.</p>

			<p>So the British government fesses up and admits that over 14% of schoolchildren aged 4 to 11 in England don&rsquo;t speak English.<br>
This was only done after some prompting by a Labour MP hoisting the government on its own petard on the Freedom of Information Act.<br>
  Since non-White immigration to the uK has gone on for so long so heavily it is very resonable to assume that there are at least twice as many second generation non-White children in the UK as first generation and we must add in the multitudes of mixed race children for good measure.On this &#8216;quick and dirty&rsquo; estimate it appears wthat over 40% of the relevant age childre in England are non-White.Given the rate of growth, therefore, it is likely a majority will be in 10 years&rsquo; time - leading, of course, inexorable to a majority non-White population in England in the range of 50 to 60 years.Certainly an observer in London or Birmingham is well acquainted with this reality.<br>
  So, therefore, England is only 10 years behind the American curve.<br>
 Some cling to the (vain) hope that a BNP political breakthrough might somehow &#8216;remedy&rsquo; the situation in the nick of time, but,alas, even in the BNP do manage a breakthrough (honestly the prospect is remote), it appears that there is only a window of 10 years maximum to do anything.Regrettably for this reason it is perhaps futile to put to much faith in BNP political success. </p>

<p>A Labour and a Tory said that? Hard to believe they really mean it much, given their parties&rsquo; track records. Nonetheless, be careful ol&rsquo; chaps: you might get arrested for sounding like you read a BNP pamphlet.</p>

			<p>The reason non-whites prospered in Europe, American and Australia was the assimilation to our culture.  A common language made people feel united, even other languages from Europeans were used at home, but English was spoken in public and in the workplace.</p>
<p>The multiculturalists are not really behind this, although their suicidal aims are merely clinical insanity and their viceral reaction to anything &#8220;hard&#8221; in life.  </p>
<p>The non-asssimilation is a ploy used by the Globalists to disjoint a country and make it easier to manipulate.  There is TV in Chinese, Spanish, Farsi, Hindi and I can even find Russian, Armenian and Arab TV programs in the high numbers on cable.  Our housekeeper confessed that even after a green card and 20 years in the US, she has no idea about our government, laws or anything other than incidental blurbs she reads in Spanish newspapers or on Univision.  </p>
<p>The end is being carefully; if you think this is by accident, think again.</p>
