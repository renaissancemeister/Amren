<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-sports/20090129/SPORTS-US-NFL-HISPANICS/">NFL Hopes U.S. Hispanics Ready for Football</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Klayman, Reuters, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Football League hopes Hispanics in the United States are ready for some good ol&rsquo; American football as well as tickets, jerseys and other gear that make the sports league one of the most profitable.</p>
<p>When the Super Bowl between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals kicks off on Sunday, the league will tackle the problems of boosting its appeal to Hispanic sports fans.</p>
<p>Of all the major North American sports leagues, &#8220;football is probably going to be the toughest sell for the Hispanic market,&#8221; said Richard Ettenson, marketing professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale, Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Super Bowl, the NFL is tapping into media deals with Spanish-language broadcasters, Latin celebrities and the teams&rsquo; profiles outside the United States to lure Hispanic viewers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve really ramped up our efforts to physically create a lot more tailored and customized ways for what is a rapidly growing Hispanic fan base to connect with the NFL throughout the year,&#8221; NFL director of marketing Peter O&rsquo;Reilly told Reuters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a major, if not the major, growth priority from a fan perspective,&#8221; he added in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the last few years, the NFL, which boasts the strongest TV ratings and largest broadcast deals of all North American sports leagues, has cut deals with a variety of media partners and corporate sponsors to further expose itself to U.S. Hispanic fans raised in soccer-loving households.</p>
<p>In conjunction with these networks, the league offers &#8220;NFL 101&#8221; introductory shows to explain the rules and action.</p>
<p>Hispanics in the United States are a desirable demographic because of their growing numbers, financial clout and youth.</p>
<p>Their collective buying power in 2012 could reach more than $1.2 trillion, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia. That would be larger than the 2008 gross domestic product of all but 11 countries.</p>
<p>CRITICAL FOR GROWTH</p>
<p>The NFL&rsquo;s efforts are critical if the league, with more than $7 billion in annual revenue, is to continue growing. That is especially true in a recession that has pinched the NFL, forcing it to cut almost 14 percent of its workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot to figure out there&rsquo;s a lot of potential growth within the Hispanic market,&#8221; said Lino Garcia, general manager of Walt Disney Co&rsquo;s ESPN Deportes, which has televised Monday Night Football games in Spanish since 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Telemundo provides Spanish commentary for NBC&rsquo;s NFL games on Secondary Audio Programing or SAP, and at the Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida, it will show a flag football game between former NFL players and Latino celebrities, as well as a concert featuring Latino musicians.</p>

			<p>I assume they mean foreign born Hispanic people that they are trying to reach out to. But, with the high ratings that the NFL has they may have already done enough to get their share of the Hispanic. The N.F.L. is immensely popular and this effort might not really about people in America that are not literate in the English language. I think the N.F.L. might actually want to get football popular in Spanish speaking countries including those in Latin America plus Spain. There was N.F.L. Europe and a regular season game played in Mexico. I have no problem with it. Business is business.</p>

			<p>Yes, I can certainly see that football (of the spherical ball variety, not the round ball variety) is really popular with Hispanics.  The reason is that Los Angeles has two prospering NFL teams that have high T.V. ratings and are sold out game after game.  (???)</p>

			<p>The people probably don&rsquo;t take into consideration that an average Hispanic man is only 170 cm (5&rsquo;7) tall. Not too ideal a population for the search of talents!</p>

			<p>This marketing initiative (just like LOWES/NASCAR Hispandering) is nothing more than a vain attempt at grasping for straws in an economic downturn. It is amazing when one subjects to thorough behavioral analysis the mentality of contemporary corporate Amerika. These guys are incapable of viewing the world in any terms that are at variance with an entitlement of mininum annual growth rates. Face it guys  &mdash;  Milwaukee&rsquo;s Best is going to be your next discount brand sponsor, not Cerveza Modelo and Hummer.</p>

<p>Do the math, in 40 years less than half the country will be White, the black population will rise only about 3%, but hispanics will be 30% of the population. So unless they are successful in getting hispanics interested in football, they will certainly lose a substantial amount of revenue.  </p>

			<p>The Country is falling apart.</p>
<p>Who CARES if the NFL survives?</p>
<p>Oh, a quick question.  Since it seems pretty clear that the NFL and everyone in it isn&rsquo;t at all concerned about whether or not the country survives (so long as there are assess in the seats and in front of the TV set at Game time), if the Country does go belly up, will they still call it The NATIONAL Football League?</p>

			<p>Little guys can be champs in soccer, ducking and weaving. Not in a sport that requires refrigerator builds. In soccer only goalkeepers find being Goliath helps.</p>
<p>Simple, really  &mdash;   if you&rsquo;re a race realist who understands a few elementary details about how human subspecies&rsquo; anatomy evolved in response to discrete selectional pressures. And no, Virginia, &#8220;nutrition&#8221; won&rsquo;t close the gaps any time soon.</p>
<p>There may be a few football outliers called Sanchez, each one hailed by the drooling liberal media as a harbinger; but they will remain exceptions.</p>
<p>As with all races, people like to see their own kind performing excellently on the world stage. Thus Hispanics prefer soccer, and the more of them there are the more it will grow. The NFL is micturating into the wind.</p>

			<p>Here is the choice:continued growth in the size of the NFL market which will translate into even bigger salaries for young black multimillionires who run around in tight spandex,even bigger$$$$$$$$$ for the billionaire corporate owners of NFL teams or&hellip;unpolluted streams,rivers,creeks;open space;beautifull mountain ranges;beautifull forests and &hellip;.a White majority.</p>
<p>Life can be very meaningfull without sports entertainmaint. Sports Entertainament has 0 to do with physical conditioning and oveerall physical health. In fact, the opposite is true. Sports Entertanment is all about eating junk food </p>

			<p>You know what, people? I&rsquo;m getting pretty tried of everything having to please Hispanics. When they lose the need to identify themselves as other than Americans (IF they are legal), then okay. But if they continue to separate themselves by nationality, culture, tradition and languge, they might as well be back in old Mexico. If the appeal is to illegals - just forget it. If we all went around having to identifying ourselves as Irish-Greek-French-German, etc. we&rsquo;d waste a lot of times. If you&rsquo;ve done it correctly, then you&rsquo;re an American! Be proud of it and proclaim it to the world.</p>

<p>Just last week I was watching this video of an interview with the former running back for the Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGpcifQcgrA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=7D70693D2E9C37FA&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGpcifQcgrA&feature;=PlayList&p;=7D70693D2E9C37FA&index;=0&playnext;=1</a></p>
<p>Even the stuff that I don&rsquo;t particularly like or agree with, even those are not entirely objectionable.<br>
BUT, you have GOT to hear what he has to say at around the 2 minute mark.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a speech that goes on for two and half minutes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to speak for you all, nor have you asked me to.  Never the less, I don&rsquo;t think any of us here will disagree with what he has to say, particularly in the above stated time frame.<br>

			<p>Robert Brown the recently retired mulato running back from the Minnesota Vikings has said on several occasions in interviews  and in his book that White guys should find better things to do with their spare time than sitting around a tv set watching sports entertainment. He recommends that White guys  spend their free time more productively reading books, excercising, and many other obvious things. By the way, Robert Brown&rsquo;s hero is not a famous jock such as Michael Jordan. Brown&rsquo;s hero is Galileo. </p>
<p>White American Males are participating in their own emasculation. I pray for a massive economic collapse.</p>
<p>John Gerdy who played on the 1972 US Olympic basketball team has written several books about how sports entertainment is cancer on American civic life.</p>

<p>Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota, Green Bay, Denver, Kansas City, St Louis, and Chicago will be in the white division.</p>
<p>Frankly, though, I don&rsquo;t think we should play the other teams. <br>

			<p> The NFL can forget about hispanics. Whenever I drive by a local park, I find that hispanic men have run the kids out of every playing field except the basketball and tennis courts and are playing soccer. American football is a sport that rewards largeness, and most hispanics  are not large-the average height of mestizos is about 5&rsquo;4&#8221;. If they embraced american football, they&rsquo;d be embracing a sport that has no use for them except as  spectators. In other words, they&rsquo;re not yet as dumb as american whites in this regard, and with their healthy sense of measuring every proposal by the rubric, &#8220;but is it good for hispanics?&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll probably never be. Soccer is a sport that rewards quickness and agility over size, unlike american football and basketball-the best player in the world in the 80&rsquo;s was Diego Maradona, who was 5&rsquo;3&#8221;! The legendary Pele was 5&rsquo;8&#8221;. Why would they abandon a sport that rewards people their size, which is also the most popular sport in the world, to embrace a &#8220;local&#8221; sport they have no future in? The NFL doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that they&rsquo;re not assimilating to our ways-this is just one example. They&rsquo;re changing us-we&rsquo;re not changing them!</p>

<p>The greedmongers never rest, do they?</p>
<p>They have brought the entire world to the precipice of financial ruin and civil destruction through their greedy efforts to take more and more and more.  Yet they keep it up.</p>
<p>Now here they are thinking about how they can satisfy their greed via football even though the economy just might take them down with everybody else, and they&rsquo;re probably going to be forced to worry about the peasants at their doors with pitchforks, rather than screwing more people out of money, but I think their greed blinds them to reality.</p>
<p>Goodbye America.  It was greed that was your final undoing.</p>

			<p>Hispanics &#8220;critical&#8221; to NFL&rsquo;s continued growth.</p>
<p>This is the whole problem with the nation, continued growth. Why must there by continued growth? So many economists have started to disagree with the idea of continued growth laizze faire type capitalism. They have observed that it is economically disastrous, in terms of really helping the average taxpaying citizen. It does however, put billions of dollars into the bank accounts of thieves who&rsquo;s greed knows no limits. Growth based capitalism, for growths sake, has ruined the whole idea of the existence of a business based on quality and longevity, and some degree of social responsibility to the community(s) is operates in. Unlimited growth does nothing in the end but create the kind of situation the U.S. and so many nations are in today. Who cares if the NFL, which already is a billions upon billions dollar entreprise, continues to grow by whatever means. It does nothing for the average citizen. NOTHING, NOT EVEN IN THE WAY OF WELL PAYING JOBS.</p>

			<p>I boycotted the Superbowl today. It is nothing more than a diversity commercial. Instead, I washed my car, rode my bicycle in my all-White neighborhood, and listened to a recording of a Swedish children&rsquo;s choir from the 1950s (back when it was still comprised exclusively of White children, before the Swedes brought undesirables to live among them and their children).</p>
<p>BTW, here is a list of the Superbowl ad sponsors to boycott.</p>

			<p>I too, did not watch a second of the Super Bowl. Instead, I watched a &#8220;Death Wish&#8221; marathon of movies on one of the cable stations.</p>
<p>When people care more about the advertisements during what is supposed to be pro football&rsquo;s signature event, then you realize that it&rsquo;s nothing more than an elaborate stage production that the likes of Busby Berkeley or Florenz Ziegfeld used to put on.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of irony in that. The teams obsessed with making sure everything looks more like the rest of America are 80 to 90 percent black. And this is turned into a celebration of diversity, against all odds, of course. </p>

<p>Those are my sentiments exactly, Jack.</p>
<p>How any white can be entertained by watching ten blacks, who all look the same, run up and down a basketball court in clownish clothes, using no intelligent game strategy and instead rely on just slam dunking a ball into a hoop is completely beyond me.</p>
<p>Football is nearly the same, with the exception that these primitives get into a little circular groups and conduct primitive motions and chants like their ancestors did in Africa and their relatives do today, and it seems to always be necessary for them to do a little tribal end zone dance if they make a touchdown, as if it has never been done before.  Primitive and childlike describes black atheletes very accurately.</p>
<p>Too bad more whites don&rsquo;t feel the same way, because blacks in sports couldn&rsquo;t exist without whites paying to watch their primitiveness.  Whites are their own worst enemies.<br>

			<p>I watch one football game a year because it&rsquo;s the sociable and right thing to do with my very aged uncle.  The Blacks with their triumphant theatrics after making a tackle or catch or whatever, remind me of nothing so much as the threatening manners of the Orcs in The Lord of the Rings.  Did the movie director draw his inspiration from Black athletics, I wonder?<br>
     BTW, there appeared to be an assault on the field.  A White player was getting up after the play and a Black player shoved him down again, and then slugged him.  Does anyone know what came of that?</p>

<p>Its a shame you cant look past color to enjoy a sport. Dont you dare say it has do with too many fights because then hockey will go out the window. Those are great sports to watch it&rsquo;s people like you who are the reason why some blacks continue to say they are kept down by whites. If you think that way thats on you but I will contiue to watch those sports and wear there jersey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Grow up, look past color genius.<br>

			<p>Am I the only one here who likes football? Who appreciates the white male athlete, even when (well, especially when;) nature has made them on the larger side of average. I&rsquo;m a big white girl, and football lets me watch big white men (well, when the defense is playing, anyway.)</p>

			<p>To anonymous, I too boycotted the super (stupid) bowl and I will go along with you on boycotting those who did post ads durning the game.  They can shove their products where the sun don&rsquo;t shine.  These people put illegals, blacks and other assorted garbage, ahead of the whites in America.  So let them sell to forign countries.  So much the better!!  Among those who put on ads, I see NONE who cater to white America, we are the FORGOTTEN PEOPLE, but they only remember us when they pick our pockets to pay for the trash they allow to rule this country.  I for one, am totally FED UPPPPPPPPP!! Bye the way, I live in Pennsylvania and I could CARE LESS ABOUT THE STEELERS WINNING&hellip;MOST ARE BLACK PLAYERS AND BRAGGERS ANYHOW&hellip;I don&rsquo;t watch baseball anymore either and basketball, forget it!!  I will watch swimming and diving, as blacks can&rsquo;t swim&hellip;.must be a cultural thing, who cares.  I watch hockey and stopped watching tennis and golf too&hellip;.the blacks and whatever seem to take that over too, they can have it!!</p>

			<p>During Superbowl, one of the announcers made the comment that the NFL is 75% black! Clearly this is proper racial representation of the % of blacks in the U.S. since I still dispute the often quoted figure of 10-15% black.</p>
