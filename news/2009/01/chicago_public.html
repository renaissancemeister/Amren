<h1>Chicago Public Schools: &#8216;No Students From Opposing Schools&rsquo; at Games</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kara Spak and Steve Tucker, Chicago Sun-Times, January 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The home-court advantage has grown significantly stronger at Chicago Public Schools basketball games.</p>
<p>CPS officials don&rsquo;t want students rooting for their teams at away games unless they are traveling with a specific, chaperoned group, like cheerleaders. This comes after four violent incidents at recent CPS basketball games, two involving gunfire.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Hoop nightmares</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jan. 9 Five teenage boys were shot outside Dunbar Vocational Career Academy after a Friday night game against Hope College Prep High School.</p>
<p>Jan. 20 A game between Simeon Career Academy and Bogan Computer Technical High School ended with 5:55 left after a fight erupted in the stands.</p>
<p>Jan. 20 Jermaine Winfield, a North Lawndale College Prep senior on the basketball team, was shot in the thigh outside Collins High School following a game. Winfield was trying to break up a fight.</p>
<p>Jan. 22 Two teenage girls reportedly started an on-court brawl after North Lawndale College Prep&rsquo;s win over Marshall Metro High School. Security escorted players into the locker room for safety.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All varsity start times have been moved to 4 p.m. to try to stop the violent brawls marking crowd behavior at several games.</p>
<p>Davis wouldn&rsquo;t specify which schools the policy targets but said most CPS basketball games are incident-free. Michael Vaughn, CPS spokesman, said &#8220;everyone knows where the issues are&#8221; when asked which schools were affected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think this is a sports problem. I think it&rsquo;s a community problem,&#8221; he said. He later said he thinks the incidents this year stemmed from &#8220;pre-existing conflicts in the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simeon Career Academy basketball coach Robert Smith said his school has always started varsity games at 4 p.m., with good reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a crisis situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to get to the core of what this is all about, and it&rsquo;s not just schools. It&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s happening in society. Families are losing their jobs, getting displaced, and there&rsquo;s a lot of anger.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In the same state, but much further south, a fight among the crowd watching a girls basketball game at Cahokia High School last Friday (near St. Louis), got into a fight, and one 17-year old was killed by gunfire.  The St. Louis media tell us that the victim was recently suspended from the school.  Now, how hard is it for a black student to be expelled by a black administration of a black school?  He must have done something extremely bad.</p>

Sounds like Mike Vaughn has this one already figured out.</p>

<p> Sounds to me that DeShaun was just anry his team lost to Demetrius&rsquo;s team. Losing jobs? Right.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love these black school names? Hope College Prep High School,North Lawndale College Prep, Bogan Computer Technical High School.There is some heavy duty cypherin&rsquo; and thinkin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on at these places. In Ohio we have Columbus Afro-Centric and the Colin Powell Leadership Academy. Cleveland used to have General Benjamin O. Davis Aeronautical High School, but that was long ago shut and turned into a homeless (bums) shelter. No kidding.</p>

			<p>And the question on everyones minds. What is the racial makeup of the schools and those involved in the mayhem. </p>
<p>Could wait a long time to see that in the article.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t interesting that during the Great Depression when most White people were out of work and barely able to feed their families, Whites didn&rsquo;t resort to murder, rape, and larceny?   Before the Civil Rights Movement, Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t dare to misbehave this way and then turn around and blame &#8216;society&rsquo; for their psychopathic behavior.</p>
<p>Clearly, even basketball doesn&rsquo;t get kids off the streets and away from crime.  Basketball promotes crime.  They way Blacks play it only encourages their aggressive behavior.  How about afterschool Greek, Latin, and Chess Clubs?  Ahem.    </p>

			<p>C&rsquo;mon.  It is an, ahem, genetic problem.</p>
<p>The basketball games and so forth are just just a symptom of this genetic problem we have with the third worlders. </p>

<p>Jesse Jackson arrested in Illinois high school protest<br>
https://www.cnn.com/US/9911/16/expelled.students.04/index.html</p>
<p>&#8220;DECATUR, Illinois   &mdash;   The Rev. Jesse Jackson was arrested Tuesday as he attempted to go onto the campus of a high school attempting to have six expelled students reinstated.</p>
<p>The board originally expelled the students for two years, under its zero-tolerance policy on violence. But it later reduced the punishment to one year and allowed them to attend alternative school.</p>
<p>The students are black, but Jackson has said it was not a question of racism but whether the students were treated fairly. He said the school board has handed out lesser punishments for more severe offenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if there is any connection? Do you think that the good Rev sent the wrong messages to Black high school kids? </p>
<p>Court Upholds Suspensions Of 6 Students For Brawling<br>
https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE2D8163AF931A25752C0A9669C8B63&partner;=rssnyt&emc;=rss</p>
<p>&#8220;A federal judge today upheld the expulsions of six high school students suspended for a brawl at a football game in Decatur, Ill., a case that had resulted in a series of protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least the court got it right. Notice the date January 27, 2009? The brawl happened in Nov 1999. Almost 10 years of court battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Arndt said the school district spent more than $100,000 in defending the suit. Decatur police officials say they spent more than $50,000 in overtime wages during a series of protests in the industrial city of 83,000 in November.&#8221;</p>

			<p>With all these problems in Chicago schools why hasn&rsquo;t the media, or better yet Congress, asked President Obama what qualifies former Chicago Schools Superintendant, Arni Dunken to be head of Dept. of Education?  This is the &#8220;change&#8221; Mr Obama promised.  I&rsquo;m sure once the taxpayers buy all these kids lap-tops, they&rsquo;ll behave just fine.  We &#8220;hope&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Keep in mind that the genius credited with &#8220;fixing&#8221; Chicago schools, Arne Duncan, is now B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s Education Secretary. It reminds me of the old Marx Brothers joke, directed at someone observing Harpo: &#8220;He&rsquo;s the brains of the operation. Gives you an idea of the operation.&#8221;</p>
