			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Leahy, Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2009  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Helen Perkins can feel the worries of her neighbors  &mdash;  and their expectations. &#8220;The things that some of our people hope from Obama  &mdash;  more help, better homes in a hurry  &mdash;  sound like they&rsquo;re hoping for a miracle from God,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>At 63, Perkins lives in Hollandale, a town of about 2,900 in the Mississippi Delta, historically a fertile territory for big agriculture and bigger misery. Chronically poor, largely African American, loyally Democratic in an otherwise very red state, the Delta is a land where deprivation and diminished dreams are as indigenous as cotton. Poverty levels, obesity and diabetes rates, teenage pregnancy statistics, failing businesses: All the bad indices are woefully high in the Delta.</p>
<p>Not far from the site of the first of Hollandale&rsquo;s many collapsed houses is a sign at the town border: &#8220;Welcome to Hollandale: A town preparing for the future today.&#8221; For many expectant people here, that future will turn on Barack Obama.</p>
<p>On Election Day, Hollandale went for Obama in a landslide, giving him 78 percent of its vote, or 1,279 votes to John McCain&rsquo;s 367. A former mayor of the town, and the first African American to hold the position, Perkins never had seen voting lines so long at the Hollandale municipal hall, where more than 100 residents lined up before the polls opened at 7 a.m. &#8220;There were some people who&rsquo;d never voted because they&rsquo;d never seen the point in voting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Barack has made them believe; Barack has given them hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the same reason, she sees political risks for Obama, in the Delta and every other distressed American community that voted heavily for him. &#8220;I know some people will be disillusioned if their lives don&rsquo;t change much in the next eight years,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Even with Barack in there, they don&rsquo;t really believe in the system  &mdash;  they think it&rsquo;s lowdown, dirty, dog-eat-dog. But they&rsquo;re giving it a chance now because of him. A lot is at stake. If it doesn&rsquo;t work out, there&rsquo;ll be more apathy and anger than ever. People will really be dogging him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the start of his political ascension, Obama has served as that rare vessel into which disparate voters have poured their sometimes conflicting dreams. For Perkins and others in the Delta, he embodied the transformative politics of the moment: cool at a time when the prototypical pol ran bombastically hot, a trumpeter of reform who wanted to &#8220;turn the page&#8221; on political dynasties like those of the Clintons and Bushes, and a trailblazer whose very presence as an African American with a viable shot at winning the presidency beckoned an unprecedented change at once generational, racial, epochal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perkins hears so many residents expecting a quick transformation that she says she wants to tell them to &#8220;be realistic, give the man time, give him a few years at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is staring at the town&rsquo;s shuttered catfish plant as she mutters this. A rusty truck sits in front of the plant, a man behind the wheel, going nowhere. &#8220;What Obama delivers to people will determine if people here stay excited, I guess,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to get disillusioned ever about him. But I worry for him. I know people need jobs. And I know some people here will maybe lose faith in him if something better doesn&rsquo;t come. People are going to be dogging him to get it. It could be hard. He&rsquo;s not God; he&rsquo;s a politician. Some people get the two confused sometimes.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>On the subject of Mississippi, the Obama campaign arrogantly pronounced more than a year ago that they could win MS if Obama were the Democratic nominee.  As a matter of fact, he didn&rsquo;t, and the margin for the Republican over the Democrat was about the same.  CNN exit polling showed that 80% of whites under 30 and 90% of whites over 30 voted McCain.</p>
<p>Also, I know some people that voted Obama over HRC in the D-primaries because they thought Obama was far more beatable, their reasoning was that whites would never vote black for President.  My response then, true as it turned out, is that the kind of whites who think that way (me included) are already in solidly red states like MS, the kind of people who would never want a black President wouldn&rsquo;t be any more likely to have voted for HRC.</p>

			<p>The consensus among economists is that the country will realize an upsurge when the stimulus package is initiated, but then the economy will plummet downward again. </p>
<p>Some are going so far as to say there is no fix that can be made, because we have a dysfunctional government that has allowed so much of a trade deficit and has borrowed so much to keep the government going, spent all social security taxes instead of holding them in a fund as they&rsquo;re supposed to do, that all of it will cause the collapse of the dollar as the world&rsquo;s currency.  They add that there are so many millions of other subprimes that will be defaulting en masse in March, it will be impossible to climb out of this hole.  The system has been a victim of so much abuse it can&rsquo;t be repaired.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re projecting that local and federal governments will enact higher taxes on a public with far fewer funds than ever until tax revolts, riots, and anti-government violence will be widespread, with racial fighting thrown into the mix as the country breaks along lines of race, politics and ethnicity. </p>
<p>Notice that Obama and his co-conspirators in the media are telling everyone repeatedly that the situation is critical and that we will be in this fix for a long time, hoping to give cover to him and his policies in order to reduce expectations and criticism.  That way even temporary upsurges will have the Obama cult bowing and praying before the god they made, because they expected the worst.</p>
<p>But whatever happens, even the best scenario, I doubt that blacks will get what they&rsquo;re expecting out of this next president.  If they expect him to wave a magic wand over them and miraculously make them smart and competitive, the messiah will fall far short and blacks could turn out to some of his biggest critics, because in the final analysis the vast majority will still be selling dope, committing other crimes, and working as janitors and maids, wondering why their station in life hasn&rsquo;t improved.</p>
<p>And the only way the majority will get into college is via affirmative action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, right now the odds are in favor of an economic collapse world-wide.  However, what nobody is saying right now that anything less than that could cause a catastrophe as bad as a complete collapse.</p>

			<p>How childish! A race of people waiting for a politician to help lower their rates of crime, obesity, drug use and teen pregnancy.</p>
<p>Things they should be doing themselves.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple what needs to be done:</p>
<p>(1) Get rid of all the gun control laws so non-blacks can defend themselves PROPERLY in the streets. Of course, this will result in all the anti-gun news media fools, police fascists, university social science types and black/ cosmopoltan pols yelling their heads off about an impending bloodbath. But, I say that would be GOOD THING to be dropping criminals in the streets.</p>
<p>(2) Get rid of all the H-1Bs. They have been responsible for the drastic decline of the tech professions in America. The businesses have been using them to destroy ALL economic incentives of the indiginous population. What prompts me to say this was seeing a memo on the bulletin board of an ex-LaSalle Bank building in Chicago a few days ago. It was a 2004 memorandum informing the bank employees that they were putting in for 30 H-1Bs as &#8220;Technical Analysts&#8221; at a wage of $66K-$89K. Now, this is a bank building within walking distance of DePaul, Roosevelt and Loyola Universities. Yet, here this big business couldn&rsquo;t find any number of computer people, math majors and engineers to fill the job title.</p>
<p>(3) Deportation of ALL illegal aliens. There are so many here in Chicago that one day while going to the unemployment office in Pilsen, I saw illegal Mexicans holding a demonstration in support of breaking the US immigration laws.</p>
<p>(4) Clarification of the 14Th Amendment so we can deport the Jackpot Babies of the illegals. It&rsquo;s astounding the number of illegal alien babies that infest the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Doing these simple things is CHEAP. We don&rsquo;t even have to house the illegals for long periods. IDing an illegal would mean they would be immediately put on a train to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Getting rid of &#8220;ALL&#8221; gun control laws would give them more guns (more deadly than before) and there would be an even bigger fight and more crime in American streets. I completely agree with all your other views but you also left out complete and total education reform.</p>
