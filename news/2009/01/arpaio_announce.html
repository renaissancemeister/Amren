<h1>Arpaio Announces Drop in Homicide Rate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan Gabrielson, East Valley Tribune (Phoenix), January 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office announced Thursday that homicide in its jurisdiction dropped by 28 percent in 2008. In 2007, the sheriff&rsquo;s office documented 32 murders, but only 23 were recorded last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio, in a press release announcing the declining homicide rate, said the improvement was &#8220;partially&#8221; due to the office&rsquo;s illegal-immigration operations.</p>
<p>The release did not articulate how illegal-immigration enforcement has benefited general public safety.</p>
<p>A Tribune investigation last year found that during 2006 and 2007  &mdash;  the first two years that the sheriff&rsquo;s office conducted operations targeting illegal immigrants  &mdash;  emergency response times slowed dramatically and arrest rates plummeted. The sheriff&rsquo;s office also reported steep increases in homicide, robbery and aggravated assault during that span.</p>
<p>In recent years, the newspaper found that the sheriff&rsquo;s office has not always entered all cases into its electronic record-keeping system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, a sheriff&rsquo;s office spokeswoman said that the homicide data released this week are accurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The figures that we gave you are absolutely reliable,&#8221; said MCSO spokeswoman Lisa Allen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The homicide data comes from figures provided to the FBI, which includes them in the agency&rsquo;s annual volume, &#8220;Crime in the United States.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Ariz. sheriff: Fewer murders because county enforces immigration law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody that doesn&rsquo;t understand that what Sheriff Joe says is true is someone out of touch with current events.  </p>
<p>If Arizona could rid itself of mestizos, their murder rate would be pretty low, because the black population there only amounts to about 4%.</p>

			<p>     Here in Florida we are now having people asking what can be done with criminals. They say that it is too expensive to build prisons and care for the inmates. I tell them to look to Sheriff Joe in the Phoenix area. Of course, the politicians don&rsquo;t want to hear of it because how much graft can you squeeze out of a few rolls of razor wire and some army surplus tents ?  America will never amount to anything as long as we have the current crop of dummies and crooks in office. We need a new national party to replace these morons and get our country back on the right track.</p>

			<p>Arpaio is a national treasure, should be a role model for all in law enforcement, he makes fools of liberals and laughs about it.</p>

			<p>Note the snotty tone of the reporter: &#8220;The release did not articulate how illegal immigration enforcement has benefitted general public safety.&#8221;  The MSM will never concede their errors.  They will also never recover their circulation.</p>

			<p>Everywhere in the Southwest, from Brownsville, TX to Northern California, the police logs are dominated by Spanish surnames 90% of the time. That condition has been since at least the mid-1980s.</p>

			<p>And while Arpaio&rsquo;s policies are working there are people working in Obama&rsquo;s camp that say they must get rid of him and his style of police work. I wonder why?</p>

<p>The &#8220;newspaper&#8221; tries so hard to discredit anything that opposes its &#8220;liberal ideals&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Arpaio has always been my hero. Police chiefs and captains throughout the country should be as brave and patriotic as this man. Instead, more often than not, they try to avoid the additional work of immigration enforcement at all costs. I have many friends and relatives in law enforcement, and when ever I bring up the subject of doing what ever one can to stop the illegal invasion, the attitude seems to be that it is too much work,or that it is someone else&rsquo;s problem. There is basic things we can start with, such as loitering laws and checking proper I.D..  Keep up the good work Joe, the rest of you, get off your chairs.</p>

			<p>This great news now we should capitalize and teach your kids to join law enforcement, border patrol, or even the military. Our country needs us to act and not wait for President Obama to sign a peace of legislature. Hopefully he will do something before it&rsquo;s to late, but one thing is for sure we need to act now against these foreign invaders.</p>
<p>I constantly read and hear about people complaining about the border yet they don&rsquo;t take nessacary actions to prevent them from coming.</p>

			<p>The Tribune used to be a more palatable alternative to the Arizona Repugnant (Republic), but for the last two years or so they have obviously been under new management, because the paper&rsquo;s format was changed to a classless tabloid style, and the investigative reporters have been assigned to dig up every last speck of dirt of Sheriff Joe that can be found. This has apparently motivated enough subscribers to cancel, because the paper announced that it was reducing delivery availability, and my neighborhood was cut from the delivery route!</p>

			<p>Here, read up on Arpaio before praising him so profusely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always suspected that there was a totalitarian element in this movement. I&rsquo;m beginning to think that I&rsquo;m right about that if many of you support this brute.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Fraise&#8221; has posted a link to an article about Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Phoenix, Arizona. The article is written by William N. Grigg. The article states that Sheriff Joe is a brute and is guilty of numerous crimes and should be in prison. William Grigg is part Mexican. He originally supported &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; such as legalizing all of the illegal aliens in America. Grigg accuses Sheriff Joe of numerous crimes but fails to offer any proof. Yes an inmate died while in custody. This happens quite often in most large jails. This doesn&rsquo;t make the Sheriff guilty of murder. Sheriff Joe is tough on inmates. This doesn&rsquo;t make him a criminal. Sure, prisoners and ex-prisoners have filed lawsuits against the county and the Sheriff. This frequently happens in a lot of large counties.</p>
<p>I am surprised that Lew Rockwell printed the article. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because Lew Rockwell and his people are obsessive libertarians that only see and understand government, and how big or little it is and how its size affects personal liberty.  The trouble with that mentality is that they totally miss how institutions other than government affect personal liberty, and mostly don&rsquo;t get race.  For instance, LR would oppose any measure on the part of government that truly eviscerated black and Hispanic street gangs, because doing so might be a technical violation of libertarian principles.  Even though where they operate, the gangs far more than government are depriving innocent people of their civil liberties.</p>
<p>Lew Rockwell would have no problem with the U.S. becoming a Latin American country, or he doesn&rsquo;t seem to as not doing so would mean that a government would actually have to exercise power and authority and enforce law, horror of all horrors.  What he fails to realize, because he doesn&rsquo;t get race, is that Rothbardian libertarianism isn&rsquo;t that big in Mexico or Brazil.</p>
<p>Hypothetical question:  Would you live in an all-white socialist country like Sweden that banned private ownership of guns, or a Taliban era Afghanistan that had virtually no government, no prohibition on the private ownership of firearms, and therefore had pure libertarian ideals?</p>
