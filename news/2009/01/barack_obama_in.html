<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This will end in tears. The Obama hysteria is not merely embarrassing to witness, it is itself contributory to the scale of the disaster that is coming. What we are experiencing, in the deepening days of a global depression, is the desperate suspension of disbelief by people of intelligence  &mdash;  la trahison des clercs  &mdash;  in a pathetic effort to hypnotise themselves into the delusion that it will be all right on the night. It will not be all right.</p>
<p>We have been here before. In the spring of 1997, to be precise, when a charismatic, young prime minister entered Downing Street, cheered by children bussed in for the occasion waving plastic Union Jacks. A very few of us at that time incurred searing reproaches for denouncing the Great Charlatan (as I have always denominated Tony Blair) and dissenting from the public hysteria. Three times a deluded Britain elected that transparent fraud. Yesterday, when national bankruptcy became a formal reality, we reaped the bitter harvest of the Blair/Brown imposture.</p>
<p>The burnt child, contrary to conventional wisdom, does not fear the fire. After the Blair experience there is no excuse for anybody in Britain falling for Obama. Yet today, in this country, even some of those who remained sane during the emotional spasm of the Diana aberration are pumping the air for Princess Barack. At a time of gross economic and geopolitical instability throughout the Western world, this is beyond irresponsibility.</p>
<p>To anyone who kept his head, the string of Christmas cracker mottoes booming through the public address system on Washington&rsquo;s National Mall can only excite scepticism. It is crucial to recall the reality that lies behind the rhetoric. Denouncing &#8220;those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents&#8221; comes ill from a man whose flagship legislation, the Freedom of Choice Act, will impose abortion, including partial-birth abortion, on every state in the Union. It seems the era of Hope is to be inaugurated with a slaughter of the innocents.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is like one of those toxic packages traded by bankers: it camouflages many unaffordable gifts to his client state. With a federal deficit already at $1.2 trillion, Obama wants to squander $825 billion (which will undoubtedly mushroom to more than $1 trillion) on creating 600,000 more government jobs and a further 459,000 in &#8220;green energy&#8221; (useless wind turbines and other Heath-Robinson contraptions favoured by Beltway environmentalists).</p>
<p>It is frightening to think there is a real possibility that the entire world economy could go into complete meltdown and famine kill millions. Yet Western  &mdash;  and British  &mdash;  commentators are cocooned in a warm comfort zone of infatuation with America&rsquo;s answer to Neil Kinnock. We should be long past applauding politicians of any hue: they got us into this mess. The best deserve a probationary opportunity to prove themselves, the worst should be in jail.</p>
<p>It is questionable whether the present political system can survive the coming crisis. Whatever the solution, teenage swooning sentimentality over a celebrity cult has no part in it. The most powerful nation on earth is confronting its worst economic crisis under the leadership of its most extremely liberal politician, who has virtually no experience of federal politics. That is not an opportunity but a catastrophe.</p>
<p>These are frank, even ungracious, words: they have the one merit that, unlike almost everything else written today about Obama, they will not require to be eaten in the future.<br>

			<p> Obama&rsquo;s measures to uplift the economy, which will be enacted shortly, will worsen the credit crisis and cause great harm to the country&rsquo;s basic economic system, according to experts who have accurately predicted the disasters that have unfolded so far.</p>
<p>Never before in history has a president been given a free hand to do what he wants, and it is a chilling prospect to millions of us who tried to keep this man from getting elected.  But those who supported him are looking for a savior to somehow wave his magic wand and all will be as it was before.  Unfortunately, that won&rsquo;t happen.  Things are due to get much worse.</p>
<p>Fear rules right now and reason and logic are in temporary suspension.  White people are scared, because they intuit that something big is about to happen, and they are ready to follow the pied piper anywhere he wants to go.  Others are left wing zealots who don&rsquo;t have a clue that this man will make things worse, not better, and theirs is a fantasy world with everybody hugging each other.</p>
<p>71% of Americans believe that the economy will improve this year under Obama.   But the experts who have called the shots correctly so far are saying this period in time is being referred to as the pre 2009 crash.  Does the 332 point plummet in the stock market on inaugeration day tell us anything about what the investors think of Obama?  It has to be a vote of no confidence of sorts otherwise we would have seen an increase on the day he took over.</p>
<p>Gold confiscation COULD be part of Obama&rsquo;s, or Geitner&rsquo;s plan, and printing more money is definitely on the agenda, but the one certain, most important feature of any stimulus package, is going to be to make certain that no white males benefit from it, just as the dwarf Robert Reich oulined in his appearance before Congress.</p>
<p>We whites are in for a bad time from black, anti-white racists, and white self-hating radicals, who really despise whites as much as they do themselves.</p>
<p>But in the end the entire situation is more likely than not to blow up in their faces, especially if they can&rsquo;t push off their failures on the Republican administration before them.</p>
<p>For aware whites, the next couple, three years are not going to be much fun, but take consolation in the fact that for our enemies it will be devastating no matter who they try to blame.</p>
<p>From the way it&rsquo;s unfolding so far, Obama will be remembered as the first great failure more so than the first black president.  For my money, if we had to have a black for president, there could never be a better time than right now. </p>

			<p>I stopped watching television around January 10th just to avoid the Obama glorification.  Even if you avoid the news, the networks were always running ads trumpeting their coronation coverage.<br>

			<p>Speaking of hype about Obama:</p>
<p>1.  We found out today that the music played by cellist Yo Yo Ma and two others was dubbed, Milli Vanilli like.</p>
<p>2.  CofCC.org has this photo taken by the Space Shuttle flying over the Capitol:</p>
<p>http://cofcc.org/?p=3104</p>
<p>The crowd shot there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as big as the crowds shown by the TV news covering the inauguration.  Someone I know floated the theory that the media photoshopped in a lot of the crowd, and now I tend to believe it.</p>

			<p>As a subscriber to AMREN and a racial realist, as well as a guy who dislikes maudlin displays of sappiness, I find this article refreshing.  I like Obama, I believe he cares for this country and wants to do the best as its leader.  But I disagree with practically everything he stands for and I LOATHE his sycophantic disciples.  I have experienced enough nausea around heroic white liberals throughout my life, I can&rsquo;t deal with 4 straight years of it.  This article is a good slap in the face to the zombies, but sadly they will never read it.    </p>

			<p>Ah, VERY Happy that AR picked this one up. I read it the other day and printed it immediately. The first paragraph is excellent.  &#8220;<br>
&#8220;the desperate suspension of disbelief by people of intelligence in a pathetic effort to hypnotise themselves into the delusion that it will be all right on the night. It will not be all right.&#8221;<br>
And he is right. It won&rsquo;t be.  </p>
<p>America, sad to say, has offically, failed.<br>
Anything deemed a success, anything praised, particularly praised out of the ordinary, is merely a symptom of that failure and hardly cause for celebration. </p>
<p>The Inauguration itself provided multiple moments of toe-cringing embarrassment (the flubbed swearing in), disgust (Rahmbo&rsquo;s adolescent hand gesture) and anger (the senile Minister&rsquo;s inappropriate, but telling, remark at the end of the benediction, no less).</p>
<p>I guess now is the time for more than just talk.</p>

			<p>A brilliant article followed by great comments.  The very arrogant man in the White House really scares me with what he is about to inflict on our nation.  He issued an exec. order today that will supply the abortion industry with all the money they will ever need.  He is a firm believer in global warming and is anxious to initiate some Rube Goldberg solutions and enter a  treaty to &#8220;address&#8221; that issue.  In addressing the economy, he is about to turn the American dollar into Monopoly money.<br>
And here is what he had to say about any dissent to his programs.<br>
This was in today&rsquo;s NY Post:  WASHINGTON   &mdash;   President Obama warned Republicans on Capitol Hill today that they need to quit listening to radio king Rush Limbaugh if they want to get along with Democrats and the new administration. </p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done,&#8221; he told top GOP leaders, whom he had invited to the White House to discuss his nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. <br>

			<p>I agree with this article. Putting aside Obama the whole idea of the presidency as some kind of &#8216;emperor&rsquo; is wrong. That wasn&rsquo;t what the founding fathers wanted at all.</p>

			<p>With regard to Obama, I have never witnessed so many people becoming so brainwashed so fast.  When I am driving I see many cars with the Obama stickers on them and when it is safe I look inside to view the people.  They may look like the rest of us, but in reality they are the &#8220;pod people&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Are these people capable of any critical analysis or do they think with their glands?  What really scares me is that they will believe anything the &#8220;Messiah&#8221; tells them especially if it is packaged in an attractive sound-bite such as &#8220;change we can believe in&#8221;.</p>
<p>Civilizations fail when they become incapable of self analysis and self criticism.  Just a casual review of 19th century or early 20th century political cartoons showed they were much more blunt and acerbic than they are now.   As our current civilization declines there will be no one left to document it save for a few web sites.</p>

			<p>Just my feelings exactly as when i watched the new &#8220;Messiah&#8221; during his campaign he reminded me of Tony Blair who with his now faled govet, has led us into the terrible recession that we are entering now.  There are many dyed in the wool socialists in Britain who are now very confused as their heroes have been proven to have feet of clay, and their previous aggressive stances against anyone such as myself who tried to point out the facts about the flawed policies and lack of effective leadership except for the stirring speeches written by his spin doctors with good catchprases ( as with Pres. BO?) and his people, were verbally and sometimes physically attacked.</p>

			<p>Obama and His speechwriters don&rsquo;t even know how many men have taken the oath of office as president (it&rsquo;s 43 not 44, as stated at the beginning of His address) or the year the republic was founded.  (See the end of His speech, and the reference to Valley Forge. That was the winter of 1777-78.)<br>

			<p>I agree with CS&rsquo;s comment above  &mdash;   I won&rsquo;t downplay Obama in the slightest for his accomplishments, and I think he&rsquo;s trying to do the right thing as far as he can tell, but I fear this is only going to make things much worse.</p>
<p>On an even more fundamental level, in regard to what Amren is about in the first place  &mdash;   what&rsquo;s really upsetting about all this, is that Obama&rsquo;s election truly does mean the end of the USA as a Western country, for good.  To be honest, this was the case even before 2008  &mdash;   anyone who&rsquo;s been in a classroom in this country, especially in a state like Arizona or California or almost any urban center, knows that the USA has a majority non-White, non-Western future, and much sooner than we used to assume.  </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s election just made this painful fact obvious, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what happens in the election in 2012, 2016, 2020 or whenever else  &mdash;   Western civilization will continue to decline in the USA, slowly and agonizingly, replaced by a predominantly non-Western culture as our demographics inexorably change.  It&rsquo;ll probably be a non-White majority much earlier than often thought before, in maybe 15-20 years if even that long.  </p>
<p>Only the UK (literally being massively colonized right now by its former colonies in South Asia and Africa), or perhaps Australia or Canada (massive Malay, South Asian, Caribbean, African, SE Asian and other such migration) will become a non-Western nation faster than the USA.  While I have no doubt about Obama&rsquo;s talents and respect what he&rsquo;s done, I can&rsquo;t help being alarmed by what this change really means  &mdash;   the United States is no longer within the Western world, even at the highest levels of government.</p>
<p>The question is what to do now.  One of the more shocking developments (at least in my opinion), is the number of people in my neighborhood and acquaintance circle who are permanently leaving the USA, and taking their families with them.  Is it becoming so desperate that this is our only option?  Not all of the West has gulped down the Kool-Aid about &#8220;the joys of diversity,&#8221; and much of the European heartland  &mdash;   basically the countries that forsook large empires in Africa and Asia, and constructed a brilliant artistic and technical culture  &mdash;   will stay White and Western.  </p>
<p>An old neighbor of mine from Texas  &mdash;   who like old general Dwight Eisenhower himself, is of part Texas German stock, with some Dutch and Viking blood as well  &mdash;   enrolled his entire family in German courses a few years ago, for reasons I couldn&rsquo;t understand at first.  Just recently when I tracked him down, I found out that he&rsquo;s moved his entire family out to some hamlet in southeastern Germany, and is raising his kids there.  (It&rsquo;s surprisingly conservative and traditional in those medium-ish German towns.)  And he&rsquo;s not the only one  &mdash;   a lot of people with those sorts of German/Nordic roots seem to be taking advantage of the same option lately.  I&rsquo;d never heard of this until recently, which has a scary implication  &mdash;   has the USA now gone so far down the path of &#8220;de-Westernizing&#8221; ourselves, via PC and diversity, that resettling in a more solid ethnic homeland, like I guess most of Germany still is, our only option?  Is the USA really that far gone, demographically and socially?  Not a question I have the slighest idea how to answer, let alone respond productively to it.</p>

			<p>The consequences of inflationary policies which benefit a racially selected segment of the population now and into the future leaves me wondering about the integrity of the nation mid-century.  By that time the debt service will be very onerous, and it will be being paid not to &#8220;ourselves&#8221; as the apologists have it, but to sovereign wealth funds of other countries, such as China, who will by then be rivals pulling past us. Will we pay? is the question which should be asked, if not by us then by them. I wonder if we will &#8220;pull an Argentina&#8221; and simply default. Possibly strong-armed tactics will keep the citizenry in thrall to the creditors, but at the cost of loyalty to the nation, I imagine. Given the stresses of racially polarized politics, which will by then have been firmly established, I see no barrier to breakup, or a realignment as it will likely be called. Since every dollar we fork over to the overseas creditors will be just another dollar impoverishing us, and sealing our fate, how can the transfer of wealth be sustained? Revolutionary politics develop when all alternative solutions are impossible. <br>
If Obama is going to avoid this dilemma he most surely will have to deny the left and the racial political base he relied on the spoils of the victory. It will have to be one very convincing about face.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care if our elected servant was plaid, polka-dotted, brown, yellow or orange.  What mattered to me is if he would uphold the Constitution of the United States.  Barack Hussein isn&rsquo;t the man for the job and neither was McCain.  Therefore, neither got my vote. </p>
<p>But the Obama worship and boot-strap licking from the maniac public is disturbing and dangerous.  </p>

<p>I think people are more aware of the situation than we think, they&rsquo;re just trying to slap a happy face on a deeply disturbing and dark landscape.  I was forced to attend the inauguration<br>
and I can tell you first hand the crowds there were not as big as the MSM would lead you to believe and it appeared to me that the majority were black.  <br>

			<p>Above, Parkland states,<br>
&#8220;Only the UK (literally being massively colonized right now by its former colonies in South Asia and Africa), or perhaps Australia or Canada (massive Malay, South Asian, Caribbean, African, SE Asian and other such migration) will become a non-Western nation faster than the USA.&#8221;<br>
Sadly, and as an indigenous resident of Britain, I have to agree with him or her. This vandalistic destruction of Western culture in Britain has occurred at a terrifying speed and is set to outstrip the USA in its pace. However, the fact is that Britain started with almost zero African, Afro-Caribbean and Asian residents in 1950 and now in 2008 is set to be a Muslim country by 2050. The BBC news camera shots of British classrooms and TV adverts for teachers can tell you all you need to know about current &#8216;British&rsquo; demography.<br>
Seeing my country as it is today in its present cultural and economic no man&rsquo;s land makes me extremely sad and angry at the present Labour government in particular for their glib vandalism. My friends are of the opinion, &#8220;Why worry, our generation will be dead soon&#8221;. Perhaps this is the way to think. However, what is most worrying is that both America (USA) and Britain (UK) have the term, &#8216;United&rsquo;, in their titles. Unfortunately the tribal and Islamofascist tendencies of the future new owners of the USA and the UK do not sit well within a united Western democracy.<br>
I predict that by 2100 both countries will not be very cozy places to live within.<br>
Death, where is thy sting.    </p>

			<p>My company, employer for 25 years, together with my pension disappeared. My other retirement savings held in mutual funds shriveled to next to nothing. In short, I am in pretty desperate financial straights and I need to ask emperor Obama on how I can spend my way out of them. </p>

			<p> Perhaps the suspension of disbelief that we are witnessing by seemingly normal people,&rsquo;pod people&rsquo; as Skipper so aptly described them, is a result of having been given the Alinsky treatment on a national scale? Remember how Obama used Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s methodology on the people of South Chicago?  Obama and his cronies admit to having used the Alinsky&rsquo;s model of &#8220;community agitation&#8221;, they admit to using his technique of &#8220;rubbing raw the sores of discontent,&#8221; (in Alinsky&rsquo;s words).  The purpose being to bring about Socialist revolution: &#8221; if we can convince the people they are miserable, then we can gather the people&#8221;, &amp; &#8220;engendering discontent, dissatisfaction with the existing system, demanding change&#8221; (Alinsky. Rules for Radicals).<br>
Change&hellip;. hmmm.</p>
<p> While some of us have differing views on the Iraq war, and while I detest Bush for his spending and immigration stance, life has not really been that bad in the US over the past few years. But what we have experienced during this period is relentless hectoring about the calamitous state of affairs we are hurtling towards, and we should blame the rich, racism, Bush, Halliburton; The polar bears are swimming for their lives, global warming,  the world hates us, it&rsquo;s hopeless and so forth. The Left seem to have been able to convince millions that they are the solution, and they sent a leader out to the country  demanding &#8220;change&#8221;; giving them &#8220;hope&#8221;.  <br>
I can offer no other explanation for this bizarre mental state. <br>

			<p>During these difficult times I have my ups and downs.<br>
That&rsquo;s when I reach for a power of example, one of the greats of Western Culture, usually pre-modern, to help me put things into perspective and make some sense of it all.</p>
<p>Here are two that really helped me take a more sober view of this whole Obama thing.<br>
First, I describe Society and Culture today in two ways.<br>
A Politically Correct, Multi-Cultural Police State. and, <br>
The Liberal, Left, Neocon Leviathan.<br>
I think both are built on a not so firm foundation of irrational and dishonest hatred. </p>
<p>For that there is a quote from Goethe that goes; </p>
<p>&#8220;Hatred is something peculiar. You will always find it strongest and most violent where there is the lowest degree of culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>And second, I believe a healthy culture can 1, accept criticism, and 2, be based on a commitment of Daily Renewal.  That no one rests on the laurels of their own or their cultures acheivements in the past.<br>
And, toward that end, we have yet another quote from Goethe, </p>
<p>&#8220;He only earns his freedom and his life Who takes them every day by storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversely, the Levithan/Police State we are up against is based on cowardice, dishonesty, betrayal and deceit.  There is no way it can survive, let alone build anything that is lasting.  Hence its heavy dependency on so much smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>We have some building and renovation and innovation to do.  We have lots of work ahead of us. And we have to do it on a consistent basis.  We also have to acknowledge that Race Realism is a Realist Movement, it is not a Conservative movement.  In any event, it is time to tap the rich resources of our culture for the inspiration to keep us going.<br>
What else have we got better to do with our time? <br>
 <br>

<p>A crisis meeting has been called over the rioting in Europe because of the economic plummet, which has Spain at almost 20% unemployment over the next year and Greece is expecting over 9% unemployment.</p>
<p>What is not being told is that they&rsquo;re not including the riots in France that are racial, and that the riots in Greece have a racial component as well. </p>
<p>It will get worse, with the blacks and muslims joining at fever pitch, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet the government&rsquo;s projected unemployment figues will easily reach about 25% in most countries and perhaps more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a huge puzzle to me why anyone, white or black, assumes that a black somehow needs to be in charge.  Which part of the world that&rsquo;s currently run by blacks do we wish to emulate? Detroit, Haiti, Zimbabwe, Congo, or some other delightful black paradise?  Give me the name of the place, I&rsquo;d very much like to hear it.  </p>

<p>I think you are right. If don&rsquo;t get it together, in terms of awareness, organization, and the will and way to fight back, we&rsquo;re done. In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty clear.  <br>
Along those lines, I very much would love to read an essay by Mr. Taylor telling us what he thinks about this. We already have an idea of his views on Race Realism and Free Association.  But I very much would love to hear, or read, his thoughts on the organization of a group that is prepared to represent and protet the rights of Race Realists.  <br>
Perhaps he has already written something to this effect that I am not aware of.  <br>
Any of you out there who know of such an article, by all means, let me know.  Still, even if one exists I would like to read something more recent, like, very recent, given the events of late. <br>
Either way, SDG, your point is well taken and, as I&rsquo;ve been saying myself for some time, here and elsewhere, it&rsquo;s high time we begin to put SOMETHING together. It&rsquo;s time to take action. And, to call Goethe to my aid once again - &#8220;Action has magic, power, and grace.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Obama is a media created myth.  He is the Will Smith character that always prevails in the movies.  Unfortunately for those of us who don&rsquo;t worship movie stars, and practice reality, we shall suffer.   The media will keep their &#8220;star&#8221; afloat for as long as they can, which could be 8 years judging from the amount of &#8220;sheeple&#8221; that you see chewing their cud and following the rest down the chutes at the stockades.  Like the bees in South America, the USA has become Africanized, and our once great country is now standing around on the street corner, waiting for &#8220;the man&#8221; to hand out the govt. checks and state sponsored drugs to keep us in our stupor.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious the MSM reports only what they feel is beneficial to their leftist agendas.  Well, here&rsquo;s the first country to go belly up (link below) even this early in the game.  If it weren&rsquo;t on the internet, I&rsquo;m wondering if we would have heard about it at all.  The MSM is NOT REPORTING bad international news of extreme importance, because it is complicit in making everything here look less severe than what it really is, thinking they&rsquo;ll be helping Obama by lulling the masses into believing his giant spending plan on roads and school renovation is going to pull us up.</p>

			<p>If any good comes from the Obummer presidency (and that&rsquo;s a big IF), it&rsquo;s that the impending global financial meltdown (make no mistake about it people, this is a depression) could very well trigger a resurgence of right-wing, nationalistic elements in Europe (a la Austria).  If that happens, my only hope is they learn from the mistakes of the 1930s and 40s.</p>
<p>As I pointed out on another post, David Dinkins made such a mess of New York City during his mercifully short tenure in office the dopey leftists here have been in no hurry to elect another black.  The same will probably happen with this charlatan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if he was &#8220;elected&#8221; president (it was through fraudulent means.  Many states allowed Demo-rats to vote in Republican primaries, thus insuring a limp-wristed candidate like McCain).  I agree with Ann Coulter: I intend to show this man the same loyalty and respect the leftists showed Bush for eight years.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Gold confiscation COULD be part of Obama&rsquo;s, or Geitner&rsquo;s plan&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I too am worried about this.  One of my most conservative financial newsletters warned recently to get any and all gold out of bank safe deposit boxes as quickly as possible and hide it well, perhaps in a floor safe or gun safe in a closet bolted to the floor (and even there it may not be safe). </p>
<p>This is the government&rsquo;s Keynesian turkeys coming home to roost  &mdash;  with more to come.  Obama should have hired economists from the Mises Institute or Cato Institute, instead of the usual statists. Of the 17 members of obama&rsquo;s Transition Economic Advisory Board Board, eight plus obama are lawyers.</p>
<p>Lawyers are not known for their economic knowledge.</p>
<p>A New Deal?  How is it possible to create oceans of counterfeit money without wrecking the economy?</p>
<p>As Richard Maybury states in his newsletter:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;After 94 years of expanding the money supply, The Federal Reserve has created so much malinvestment that mere inflation and deflation are no longer options&hellip;the only choice now is between runaway inflation and runaway deflation (meaning a depression)&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>What amazes and disgusts me at the same time is how it&rsquo;s considered &#8220;progress&#8221; when whites cede political control to non-whites in Western nations.  Why is it not progress to politically empower whites in non-Western nations?  A white man would never, ever, get elected in a majority non-white nation.  If by some miracle he did there would be riots, violence and protests.  Non-whites are too tribalistic and narrow minded to consider voting for anyone outside of their tribal/racial/ethnic group in appreciable numbers.  The recent election proved that beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>On top of the unstoppable immigrant flood, whites seem to be turning on each other instead of turning to each other.  The white working class of England is pilloried and lampooned by the very people that are supposed to be looking out for their own interests.  American movie stars and notables never met a non-white they didn&rsquo;t adore and a non-white racial cause they didn&rsquo;t wish to lavishly fund.</p>
<p>We can all take stock that a white man will be elected again, but he will most likely be a rootless, raceless, leftist Democrat or leftist Republican.  Unfortunately, the demographic changes and moderate to leftist political bent of 40% of whites guarantee that someone in the mold of a Pat Buchanan will never rise to prominence again. </p>
<p>I believe that secession is our only hope.  Any secessionist state or states must be white nationalist and offer a safe haven for whites for us to have any chance of survival.   </p>

			<p>I suppose what I find most annoying by Mr. Obama is the presumption by the faithful of his overwhelming success in dealing with our national problems. First, I do not accept his solutions as practical or useful and second, he has not done any of them yet.</p>
<p>They keep saying Obama likes Abraham Lincoln and likes to study his speeches. Apparently, he would do well to recall one of Lincoln&rsquo;s statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hen must be the wisest of all of God&rsquo;s creations, because she does not cluck until AFTER the egg is laid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lincoln was complaining about the many Union generals that freely predicted their victory over the Confederates, wishing they would save the victory parade until AFTER the victory.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Mr. Obama. He needs to wait until he actually solves a problem before expecting acclaim for his success. Thus far, he has done the nation no service at all.</p>

			<p>  The semi-religious cult of Obama will not be doing him any favors in the long run. I want him to succeed because I don&rsquo;t want the country to go through another depression. I believe he means well but the cliché goes that hell was paved with good intentions. I just can&rsquo;t see how we can borrow and spend our way out of this economic crisis. After all, that&rsquo;s how we got into it in the first place. President Obama needs to call Thomas Sowell or Peter Schiff for sound economic advice. </p>

<p>You are quite right sir. You CAN &ldquo;THANK&rdquo; the Labour party for your grief and racial dispossesion. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder though, what you and other Brits of your generation thought 41 years ago when Enoch Powell warned you exactly what was going to happen. The British people can never say they weren&rsquo;t warned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the British were warned by Enoch Powell in 1968 what would happen. However, and I was around at the time, Powell did not put himself up as a representative of the majority of Britons who were against immigration - he merely voiced the opinion of the majority. The fact that he was shouted down by his party and banished to years of obscurity outside of mainstream politics was an act that was reviled by the British public. He was literally a man of his time and voiced the opinions of most British men and women of his time. It was unfortunate that Powell&rsquo;s comments were made so soon after Britain&rsquo;s war against  fascism - his words were, and still are very accurate. However, the words Nazi, racialism and fascist were easy terms for the liberal elite to throw at Powell&rsquo;s honesty over what he saw.<br>
Today in Britain one can be arrested for wearing a &#8216;Was Enoch right?&#8221; t-shirt. This shows the power of his argument is still feared and politicians still eager to distance themselves from the debate. We wanted Enoch as a leader in 1968&hellip;.but he didn&rsquo;t want the job out of loyalty to his party. Misplaced loyalty, I fear.   </p>

			<p>hopefully the election of Obama will, in eight, twelve, even sixteen years cause the collapse of the system, including the current constitutional system as defined by bigoted, ultraliberal courts since WWII. Will there be violence or not? No one really could possibly know.  But the confiscation of America&rsquo;s private wealth, the destruction of free enterprise and the creation of a monster state with hundreds of millions of unproductive drones dependent on its largesse will surely spark the counterevolution of the strong and creative. Intelligence and imagination will determine the winner; let the hispanics breed another 200 million and the blacks breed another generation of blob like young men. Humans will always conquer animals if they know who they are and what their goal is. To Civilized Humanity!  A thousand generations of dominance!heneecate or fore0n nosereeratraw &#8221; No </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thought of that as well, Bon.  I have gold and silver also.  I don&rsquo;t use safety deposit boxes anymore, because of the danger of bank closings. I&rsquo;ve made other arrangements.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a site address to give you right at the moment, but there&rsquo;s several sites on the web which are giving instructions on alternative security measures, one of which is the construction of a concrete, waterproof underground vault for items like silver, gold, guns and ammo.  There&rsquo;s a way it can be constructed to thwart any kind of underground detection equipment, and it would be much safer against roving bands of black marauders than even a huge safe in the closet.</p>
<p>I just received an email from an analyst I&rsquo;ve been with for quite a long time now who is strictly objective. He and his team are projecting social and business situations constantly, and his email alert reads:  &#8220;CODE RED!  Economy in collapse.&#8221;<br>
Obama, he says, is adding to the problem.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other forcasters he sees the next big crash as involving commercial real estate, with millions more foreclosures coming from the residential sector.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not selling anything but his expertise, so he doesn&rsquo;t have a reason to slant the news, as some of the people do selling gold, crying wolf in order to get the public to buy more.</p>
<p>Also, for the edification of everybody, I might just mention that the US mint is sold out of gold eagles and won&rsquo;t be selling more until further notice, which indicates that something is up right now concerning gold.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this Obama were to outlaw all gold bullion as Roosevelt did, because they see a collapse in US currency coming.</p>
<p>Too, some kind of manipulation is going on concerning the price of gold, probably by the government,  because it should be up around 1200 to 1500 dollars right now, but it&rsquo;s been fairly static even as the situation worsens, which is really strange.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like the idea of a black in charge then go live some where else. What did you do to see to it that he wasn&rsquo;t put into power? Did you campaign against him publicly? Or did you gripe and whine about it over the internet where nobody will see or here you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea of a black in charge. That&rsquo;s true. Especially a socialist like Obama. I don&rsquo;t like the fact that he&rsquo;s surrounded by Clintonistas like Hillary Clinton and I don&rsquo;t like the open anti-white racism of his worshippers or the mindless, childlike propaganda about &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;yes we can&#8221; being rammed down our throats by the media. If Obama completes the destruction of the economy like I think he will, I might go live somewhere else  &mdash;  if I can find a place that hasn&rsquo;t been trashed by the same crowd which has taken over both parties here.</p>
<p>As for campaigning against him and all that stuff, I&rsquo;m guessing that most people here either voted for McCain or Ron Paul or didn&rsquo;t vote at all. The choice this time around was between two disasters. Both candidates were worse than the other. At any rate, what were we supposed to do &#8220;to see to it that he wasn&rsquo;t put into power?&#8221; Considering his cult-like following, that would have been like trying to keeping Jesus from rising from the dead. In any case, the game is rigged. If we had campaigned against Obama, people like you would have called us racists. If we&rsquo;d campaigned openly for white interests, we would have been smeared, attacked and shut down before we even got started.</p>
<p>Nobody here&rsquo;s &#8220;griping and whining,&#8221; either, unless you think pointing out reality is a form of whining, which apparently you do. And we&rsquo;re anonymous because we have to be. It&rsquo;s easy for you to troll forums like this, but holding opinions like ours is already a criminal offense in Europe and Canada and you can be fired here for questioning the prevailing dogmas about race. You don&rsquo;t face any penalties if you speak your mind because everything you think is safely politically correct and you have the added protection of being a member of an official victim group. We don&rsquo;t have that luxury.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I believe Obama has what it takes to do so. He will make mistakes that many of us will deem as foolish, but never the less he will get us out of our current slump.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is more than just a &#8220;slump&#8221; and it looks like Obama is going to make deliberate policy decisions (not &#8220;mistakes&#8221;) that could prove to be fatal. Like most socialists, he thinks the answer is more government and more government spending on make-work jobs which we already know are going to be handed out to minorities (&#8220;no white male construction workers.&#8221;) The fact is, however, that the government can&rsquo;t create jobs and the government can&rsquo;t fix this problem. The Feds created the problem in the first place and Obama is going to make it worse.</p>
<p>Obama thinks that we need another New Deal program of massive government intervention and spending, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that FDR (and Hoover before him) turned a one or two year recession into a ten-year depression using exactly the same approach. Peter Schiff compared the Obama plan to trying to put out a fire with gasoline. Obama&rsquo;s not alone in this folly, of course. The economic crisis was created by the Federal government, the Federal Reserve in particular. Ron Paul was the only candidate who seemed to have any idea what was going on and the media froze him out.</p>
<p>The problem here isn&rsquo;t the economic contraction we&rsquo;re going through right now. The problem was the inflated bubble that eventually exploded and created the present recession in the first place. America&rsquo;s broke. We&rsquo;ve been living on cheap credit for decades, outsourcing our productive industries, borrowing money to pay for junk we don&rsquo;t need, and now we can&rsquo;t pay it back. The Feds are broke. Obama&rsquo;s going to be running trillion dollar deficits for years and it&rsquo;s simply unsustainable.</p>
<p>Obama wants to keep the bubble inflated, but that&rsquo;s only going to make the problems worse. The only way he&rsquo;s going to be able to pay for these massive spending projects is by inflating the currency  &mdash;  printing more money  &mdash;  or by borrowing it from the Chinese and other foreign investors (who are probably figuring out by now that the US is broke and will never be able to pay them back). The result will be a surge of ruinous inflation in a year or so. Maybe even hyper-inflation. If Obama keeps going the way he&rsquo;s going now, he&rsquo;s going to cause a currency collapse. It&rsquo;s inevitable. It won&rsquo;t matter how much money you make because the dollar will be worthless. </p>
<p>Inflation&rsquo;s inevitable no matter what he does, but he could easily turn it into hyper-inflation and if that happens we&rsquo;re screwed. Democrats and Republicans are both complicit in this fiasco. Bush and his cronies were asleep at the wheel for eight years (so much for the Republican&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;fiscal responsibility), but this goes back through several different administrations and the congress has been absolutely worthless. The incompetence of our &#8220;leaders&#8221; is really mind-boggling and your faith in the Messiah is misplaced, to say the least, not that I believe for a minute that you support Obama because of his economic policies. Like 95 percent of blacks, you support him because he&rsquo;s black. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am a proud OBAMA supporter. We willing ready able to do what is needed to insure we uplift the the problems off the backs of AMERICANS. I believe Obama has what it takes to do so. He will make mistakes that many of us will deem as foolish, but never the less he will get us out of our current slump.&#8221;<br>

<p>Obama is a pro-black whose greatest reason for becoming pres is to advance any cause he deems in the black interest and if whites somehow benefit too, it is strictly an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>That you feel it necessary to promote this sub-standard black president on a site with people that know full well the man is incompetent is a curious matter, rather than submitting your comments on a newspaper comment section where the readers are ill-informed and much easier to fool.</p>
<p>Obama is a racist just like his preacher the racist, evil Reverend Wright, and like Malcolm X he despises every drop of white blood in his body. </p>
<p>He was elected because Bush was so incompetent he literally destroyed the Republican party by helping them compete with Democrats for non-white votes, and because he listened to his neo-con advisors and unilaterally invaded Iraq, with the promise of more attacks on countries like Syria and Iran later on.</p>
<p>It was the Obamaites within the Democrat party who were behind the collapse in the world economy, and it is they who will go down with their messiah when the process is finally completed in all out civil wars throughout the West.</p>
<p>Yes, Obama will make mistakes, and when he does it will appear amazing to his supporters as they watch him crack under the pressure and revert to the same kind of attitude which is rife within the population of his ghetto brothers.</p>

<p>Of course Johnson who used a false flag scenario in the Gulf of Tonkin, causing the needless deaths of 58,000 men in Vietnam was a success wasn&rsquo;t he?  And Jimmy Carter wasn&rsquo;t a bumbling fool either, right?</p>
<p>The only thing I can agree with you on is that every president we&rsquo;ve had has been a loser, at least to some degree.  And the only way we&rsquo;re going to have an effective nation&hellip;..which includes every country on earth&hellip;..is to have a true homogeneous nation &#8220;of the people,&#8221; small enough where the politicians are held in strict account by the people they&rsquo;re supposed to serve.</p>
<p>Complete egalatarianism is the dream of fools.</p>

			<p>The media are portraying Obama as a unifying force, bringing together all of America into one big, patriotic force. All change - Bush out (nasty man), Obama in (nice man).<br>
If the truth be known, Obama has split America down the middle - blacks/ethnics on the one side and every body else on the other.<br>
Obama, in selling himself as a black man to black voters (in fact, he possesses more white western mannerisms than black, especially on the dance floor), has used up all of his options.<br>
He cannot move very far without alienating black support. Wait for the cries of, &#8220;Sell out&#8221; from those who believed that Obama could change their life chances. <br>
Oratory, the triumph of style over content.<br>

			<p>The &#8220;economic stimulus package&#8221; is going to backfire.  Putting another $800 billion into circulation merely means that the Federal Reserve Bank will print the money based on the sales of US Treasury Bills to investors.  The problem is that this money is completely ficticious.</p>
<p>When the US went off the gold standard, the only thing backing up our currency is the value of the goods and services produced in the US each year, plus the fixed assets.  With the economy contracting, the real value of US currency has declined, and diluting the money already in circulation with an additional $800 billion in funny &#8220;money&#8221; is only going to create a new round of inflation.  The T-bills, in the meantime, will have to be sold at higher yield and at lower prices to attract investors, many of which - particularly China - are becoming quite alarmed by the wildly irresponsible US fiscal policy and the resulting weak dollar.</p>
<p>In spite of Obama&rsquo;s posturing to the contrary, the stimulus package is going to be full of &#8220;earmarks&#8221; - pork - as eggregiously silly as those attached to the infamous bank bailout package, since precisely the same congresscritters who wrote the bank bill will be writing this one.  Obama could veto such a bill - I don&rsquo;t think he has the guts - but congress may just override him.</p>
<p>The conditions that created the recession have not changed, and won&rsquo;t change.  If the feds had a real desire to get Americans back to work, they&rsquo;d cut corporate taxes, which are the world&rsquo;s highest.  The money companies fork over to big government&rsquo;s protection racket is obviously money they can&rsquo;t spend hiring Americans, training them, or buying new plant equipment to make them more efficient workers.</p>
