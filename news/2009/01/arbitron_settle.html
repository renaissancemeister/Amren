			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Hinckley, New York Daily News, January 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The attorneys general of New York and New Jersey Wednesday announced the settlement of lawsuits that charged radio ratings service Arbitron with undercounting minority listeners.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Arbitron will pay a settlement of less than a million dollars and promises to continue refining its new Portable People Meter (PPM) technology to reflect listening as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo had a slightly different perspective. He referred to Arbitron&rsquo;s rollout of PPM as &#8220;misrepresentation of a flawed product&#8221; that &#8220;should not have been released.&#8221; Cuomo vowed his office &#8220;will aggressively hold Arbitron to rigorous standards to make PPM better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuomo and New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram had charged that PPM undercounted minority listeners so badly that it threatened the survival of black and Hispanic stations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope our company and the radio industry will see more reliable and accurate data as a result of this settlement,&#8221; said Charles Warfield, president of WBLS&rsquo; parent, Inner City Broadcasting.</p>
<p>The Spanish Radio Association called the settlement &#8220;a major step forward for accurate ratings data,&#8221; but cautioned that until all settlement steps are implemented, advertisers should &#8220;view the flawed PPM ratings with great skepticism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arbitron agreed to a series of technical benchmarks for PPM measurement. It will also provide more than $100,000 to minority broadcasters and help promote minority broadcasting.<br>

			<p>Just one more example of racial extortion.  At least the White marxist in charge dared show his face.  I have personal experience with Arbitron.  It is among the most politically correct companies in the country.  They actually are very concerned with including blacks and hispanics in their surveys, but it is rather hard to get either of those two groups to follow up on anything, much less carry out some sort of procedure, no matter how simple.</p>
<p>Ratings are used to set advertising rates.  Eventually, for radio stations owned by protected groups, this will not matter.  They will simply be supported by tax dollars, courtesy of Andrew Cuomo.  Or maybe, White owned stations will simply be required to support them.  </p>

<p>Does this statement need a translation? What I read is &#8216;Under the agreement, Arbitron will now be required to make the numbers say what minorities believe they should say&rsquo;. <br>

			<p>Is it just me? I am so sick of turning on the TV and every program seems to have blacks involved. blacks, blacks, blacks, they are of course the worlds leading geniuses, inventors, teachers, business executives. My problem is I don&rsquo;t see this in the Real World and I&rsquo;m sick of having it pushed down my throat as if it is real by the media. The newest twist is black males with white girlfriends and wives.</p>

			<p>If the ratings under-represented the minority listeners, how does anyone know they were under-represented?</p>

			<p>If blacks and Latinos had any gumption they would start their own rating systems.  The problem is that they do not have the talent or money.  So what they do is cry and scream racism and try to get whitey to do the work for them.  </p>

			<p>The point of ratings is to sell advertising time.  Blacks and Hispanics are not highly valued customers to most businesses, because of their poor financial habits.  They have bad credit, and they have bad credit because they don&rsquo;t save any money and they don&rsquo;t pay their bills on time, if at all.  Arbitron makes its money by telling advertisers where the preferred sort of customers are to be found, middle class Whites.  </p>

			<p>Reminds me of what happened in my home town, my favorite station right in the middle of the FM dial went from carrying two or three nationally syndicated very famous hosts to haveing a Spanish language sports talk staion. I seriously thought it was a prank the first day it changed over, I kept switching back to catch the &#8220;punch line&#8221; but alas, it really happened. Freaking amazing.<br>
That was in Albuquerque though, so it figures, considering a actual makeup, not just the legal folks who fill out census forms.</p>
