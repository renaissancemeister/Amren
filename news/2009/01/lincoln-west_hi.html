			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Ott, Cleveland Plain Dealer, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students attending the school on Cleveland&rsquo;s near West Side [Lincoln-West High School] hail from more than 30 countries and speak more than two dozen languages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lincoln-West is a district clearinghouse for high school English language learners. Nearly a third of the 1,500-plus students speak limited or no English, one of the highest percentages of any high school in the state.</p>
<p>Districtwide, about 2,700 Cleveland students are learning to speak English.</p>
<p>Some of the teenagers are from refugee camps, where education is bare-bones, if it exists at all. They may arrive illiterate in their own languages, then are expected to quickly pick up a new one loaded with words that sound alike or have multiple, unrelated meanings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the exams [Ohio Graduation Tests in reading, writing, math, science and social studies], the students listen to instructions recorded in their languages.</p>
<p>During the tests, they can consult crossover dictionaries or have translators read them questions. {snip}</p>
<p>Some of the students slog six years to complete courses, pass the state tests and get their diplomas; yet their exam scores are stacked up against teenagers who learn English from infancy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The task strains Lincoln-West&rsquo;s faculty.</p>
<p>The school has only 10 teachers at the school certified for bilingual classes in the standardized-test subjects. District officials say they struggle to find enough qualified teachers. In fact, schools nationwide are short on staff to deal with surging numbers of non-English speakers, a new study by Education Week magazine says.</p>
<p>Even with training, Lincoln-West teachers might not know some languages spoken at the school, like Yoruba, the tongue of western Nigeria, or Dinka, from the Sudan. Fourteen aides help fill in the gaps, but in some cases teachers have to make points by drawing pictures or acting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of the district&rsquo;s English language learners are Hispanic. Many are born in the United States, but their families use Spanish at home to stay connected to their roots, said Jessica Gonzales of Esperanza, a Hispanic social-service agency on the near West Side.</p>
<p>Gonzales said the students from Puerto Rico also stay physically connected to the island, going back for long holiday visits  &mdash;  timed to get the cheapest airfare  &mdash;  or during the summer. The trips can cause students to miss weeks of school or regress in their use of English, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students who come from refugee camps or other stark environments pose a huge challenge. Before teachers can get into the meat of their subjects, they may have to show children how to hold a pencil, turn a paper right-side-up, work a combination lock or even use a restroom.</p>
<p>Some of the teenagers are from countries with record-keeping so sparse that parents don&rsquo;t know when their children were born. Relief agencies routinely put down Jan. 1 as the date and guess at the years.</p>
<p>Many of the students&rsquo; homelands have no factories or live under authoritarian rule, so the teens have no context to call on when ninth-grade social studies teacher Brigitte Bolgar talks about industrialization and democracy. And if they pass Bolgar&rsquo;s class, they are on their own  &mdash;  the school has no social-studies teachers trained to work with English language learners in the upper grades.</p>

			<p>I just today drove past the old Junior High and High School about 3:00pm. It was disconcerting to see my old 90% White stomping grounds now about 90% Latino. No scratch that. My mile relay handoff man Tony Rodriguez was Latino. These students were so far removed from even that descriptor. I don`t even have the words to describe them. The biggest  shock of all was seeing  dozens of girls with completely Mayan looks and stature wearing Letter jackets. I think I will ask to take a &#8220;tour&#8221; as I have not been back in 35 years. Curious as to who the instructors to this bunch are now and how the shop and welding classes are doing. Could posters help me with the language of aquescience to the power structure to get in the door and get a good look? &#8220;Hi! My name is Tim and I`m writing a free lance magazine article on the (insert grovel phrase here) of diversity that my old school has become&hellip;</p>

			<p>I noticed in the inaugeration speech that when Obama mentioned the gloabl economic collapse, he again pointed the finger at the greedy banking system.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder why the burden of responsibility is completely put on them. Isn&rsquo;t a contract a binding agreement between two or more parties that would require the borrowers signature? <br>
And I wonder how many of those contracts were in Spanish?<br>
But I suppose Obama&rsquo;s speech writer didn&rsquo;t want to bite the hand that feeds him (the voting public), hold on who feeds who?</p>
<p>This &#8216;gentleman&rsquo; has a violently selfish and unquie way of getting English lessons in todays news.</p>

			<p><em>Before teachers can get into the meat of their subjects, they may have to show children how to hold a pencil, turn a paper right-side-up, work a combination lock or even use a restroom.</em></p>
<p>This is laughable. If the children cannot hold a pencil or go to the bathroom on their own then the parents must not be much more sophisticated. I thought (foolishly and naively) that immigrants were supposed to bring skills to the &#8220;new&#8221; country to help build it, and to make it a better place. I feel these children are beaten from the start. They are victims, and will grow up to victimize others in the vicious circle model. Instead of showing them how to hold a pencil it might be more just and more prudent to show them how to hold a shovel. Furthermore, our own children are held back because of these immigrant children. It seems that mediocrity and the lowest common denominator are our social and cultural icons forced upon us by slovenly liberal regimes. <br>

<p>You, sir, sound like a white man over the age of eighteen. Good luck visiting a school! Or about any other government facility nowadays outside the public library.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to disguise yourself as a man of another race.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;Could posters help me with the language of aquascience to the power structure to get in the door and get a good look?..&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to go about it:</p>
<p>Educational bureaucrats live and die by NCLB-mandated test scores. They are well aware of the huge gap between Whites and NAMs  &mdash;  and will jump at ANY opportunity to enroll a White or Asian kid to boost test scores:  &#8216;See, our school is so safe and achievement-oriented (that&rsquo;s edu-speak) that even Whites want to enroll!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that in mind, I would go to the office and announce that you are interested in enrolling your child (or grand-child if you are older) in that school because you&rsquo;d heard it &#8216;respects and encourages diversity&rsquo; and is striving mightily to &#8216;narrow the achievement gap.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>If the surrounding area is non-White, mention that you want your child to experience the &#8216;vibrancy of other cultures&rsquo; instead of the boring sameness of the White-dominant curriculum, White-centered school in your area and that you&rsquo;d be willing to drive your child to this school so he could be &#8216;culturally enriched&rsquo; and become &#8216;culturally literate&rsquo; in our &#8216;increasingly multi-cultural, multi-ethnic society.&rsquo; If the school &#8216;culture&rsquo; is black, toss in how pleased you are that a &#8216;person of color&rsquo; has finally been elected to the presidency. </p>
<p>At this point, after using these code words and phrases, a high-ranking administrator should appear to take you on your desired tour.  He will want to show off a prospective White parent and you will be shown the &#8216;good&rsquo; side of the school.  You will be steered clear of any dangerous, chaotic areas (as much as possible, at least). All the while, the administrator will try to impress you by speaking to you in edu-speak and double talk, and start up with the usual gobble-de-gook about &#8216;rising test scores&rsquo;, safety issues, the number of teachers that are credentialed, and NCLB compliance issues to impress upon you that he &lsquo;earned&rsquo; his degrees.  To prove his &lsquo;great knowledge&rsquo; of educational issues he will blather on about the newest programs HE implemented using the latest &lsquo;brain-based&rsquo; research straight from &lsquo;university researchers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You will be invited into his personal office so he can make sure you see his degrees and any other &lsquo;honors&rsquo; he&rsquo;s achieved which will be displayed prominently behind his large, expensive desk.  A copy of &#8216;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&rsquo; by Communist Paulo Freire and  Bill Ayers&rsquo; &#8216;Teaching Toward Freedom&rsquo;  will also be displayed prominently somewhere on the desk.  In the office, he will tell you he was brought in specifically to &#8216;turn around&rsquo; a failing school, and that he has &lsquo;made great strides&rsquo; or &lsquo;completely turned around&rsquo; a &lsquo;culture of failure&rsquo; by  cleaning up the mess of discipline problems, poor test scores, high teacher absences, and low morale.</p>
<p>You can be sure at the next politburo meeting, the idiot administrator will stand up and proudly announce that his school has made such gains that even out-of-area White parents are falling all over themselves, fighting to enroll their precious children in his school.  He will take full credit for attracting White parents to his school.</p>
<p>Listening to the insufferable morons that run these schools will be hard to stomach but it will get you your desired tour.</p>
