<h1>Neb. Judge Rejects Affirmative Action Ban Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Jo Bratton, AP, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Nebraska judge on Thursday rejected a lawsuit that challenged the petition that led to a statewide ban on affirmative action.</p>
<p>Voters approved the initiative in November, after opponents of the effort filed the lawsuit in Lancaster County District Court.</p>
<p>The constitutional amendment never uses the words &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221; But it prohibits state and local governments from giving preferential treatment to people on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.</p>
<p>The lawsuit challenged the validity of petition signatures, saying some were gathered using a &#8220;pattern of fraud and illegality.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Gale determined that the initiative had 24,000 more valid signatures that it needed to make it on the November ballot. The measure won 58 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>If the lawsuit had been successful, it could have invalidated the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of University of Nebraska-Lincoln student Jeff Hall.</p>

1st National of Nebraska, $10,000. <br>
Writelife, $10,000. </p>
<p>Warren Buffet is beginning to make me really, really sick.  He has lived a quite sheltered life and neither he nor his kids have ever been the victim of affirmative action or black crime.  What a hypocrite.  He is more worried about starving people outside America than he is about starving Americans.  We need to turn this tide of destruction, people!<br>

			<p>The Connerly organization does a good job with ballot language, because I have not yet heard of a judge overturning a measure in the states in which it has passed.</p>
<p>Also, I bet the student who filed the lawsuit did so on the prodding of a professor.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why this site decided to take out Ward Connerly&rsquo;s name?  I know he&rsquo;s black, but what he&rsquo;s doing is the right thing.  </p>
<p>In a competitive society, we should take out all barriers to allowing people to succeed, and let the chips fall where they may.  Some people will rise to the top, some won&rsquo;t.  </p>

			<p>As has been said before with other matters, a light at the end of the tunnel perhaps?  Now it would be excellent for this trend to spread to all States as well as the World.  If they are not going to make it with unfair privileges in 60 years, they have to do it on their own and the ones that do succeed will be better for it anyway.</p>

			<p>It is a grand thing to see people using the legal methods at their disposal to end the reverse-racism that is affirmative action, and my hat is off to this true-hearted Judge.</p>

			<p>If life were fair, these liberal philanthropists would spend the remainder of their lives inhabiting a minority section of Linkoln or Omaha.  Their grand-children and great-grand children could attend the local public schools.  I can&rsquo;t imagine them complaining, it should be bliss for them surrounded by all that diversity.</p>

			<p>Go to Discover the Networks  (www.discoverthenetworks.org).</p>
<p>Interesting site&hellip;you can type in Obama&rsquo;s name or Warren Buffett&rsquo;s name, and give it about five minutes, and the site will spit back a link map of all the foundations and such that the target name links to.</p>
<p>The Tides Foundation is really interesting.  And the question comes up: where is all this money coming from.  A lot of it is controlled by Theresa Heinz Kerry and her various foundations.</p>
<p>Set some time aside and explore&hellip;you never know what you will find.  Have an interesting neighbor?  Check his name out.  Maybe he is up to no good.</p>

			<p>GetBackJack, I agree with you on Buffet. Like Mr. Gates (Bill) he never has any concern for the people who worked in the business(es) that made them filthy rich. They are mostly engaged in charity work OUTSIDE OF the nation that did so much for them.</p>

			<p>Hmm&hellip;almost $400,000. bucks. Yeah, the economy is really suffering. There&rsquo;s just no money to go around. What a severe recession. These are YOUR registered democrats at work.</p>
<p>I wish I had an extra 50k to throw around. The economy this, the economy that. EVERY time I turn on the TV or radio, this is what I hear. But when hooliganism such as this appears, quick, turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>This is exactly the ammunition that needs to be collected and used against the liberal media. This is what needs to be shown to our young people. EVERY CHANCE WE GET. Let them see the truth and how things work in the real world.</p>
<p>Remember, you can&rsquo;t interact with your TV or Radio. They&rsquo;re both HEAVILY censored. The internet is quickly becoming as such. But we CAN interact with out families.</p>
<p>Liberal democrats work very hard to teach their children to be self-loathing and that basic White America is inherently evil. They instill in them a life long devotation to cowardice and impudence. Remember, one can always hide behind the First Amendment.</p>
<p>In recent times, I see a new breed of liberal appearing. One I like to refer to as &#8220;The Super Coward&#8221;. These are people who have all but perfected the art of wielding the FA like a mighty club. They almost know no boundries. They borderline the untouchable. They know this and know it well. More importantly, they&rsquo;re aware that you and I know this. And, it angers us, it angers us well.</p>
<p>Ah, sweet dissention. Divide and conquer. Who needs the Second Amendment? THIS&hellip;is where the REAL power is.</p>
<p>The Super Coward has truly come of age. It&rsquo;s trendy and popular. Which is why our younger people are drawn to it. There is almost nothing that can or cannot be done with the FA that will land you in jail. It&rsquo;s the perfect weapon. You don&rsquo;t have to have a licence to use it. No special training required. It can be used within the city limits. It is practically impervious to police. It cannot be confiscated. It comes with the label &#8220;no responsibilty required&#8221;. And best of all&hellip;it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>No other weapon in the history of the world can claim what the FA can.</p>
<p>The above dollar figure represents one distinct issue. If you have more money than you know what to do with, then your version of the FA is more important. This issue is being modifed all the time in more and more clever ways. Such as get our youth hooked on &#8220;disinformation&#8221; which leads to fear and paranoia. (Gore;Global warming, etc.)</p>
<p>Whatever it takes to get someone to vote Democrat. This previous election fracas was a prime example. When fear of the earth melting started to wear thin, the liberals got worried. So they changed their tactic. Guilt became the new weapon of choice. When you&rsquo;re younger, you want everyone to like you. And no one likes a racist. So you better vote black.</p>
<p>It worked like a charm. It also didn&rsquo;t help that right wing Americans were so easily divided. They got us to turn on each other to the point that we didn&rsquo;t know who to vote for. They got us so angry that we went and rushed out and voted all over the map. Well, all I can say is maybe next time, say four years from now, you&rsquo;ll remember what happened. </p>
<p>I want to spend the next four years adamantly working hard to make sure the Super Cowards are knocked backed down to where they belong. We need to use their words and their tactics against them.</p>
<p>It is NOT stooping down to their level. Not anymore. It&rsquo;s fighting fire with fire.</p>
<p>Black osamians will NOT tell me how to live my life. No cult will. Young people need to be taught that a lower standard of living for the sake of minorites or someone else&rsquo;s agenda, is unacceptable. Which is exactly how cults operate in the first place.</p>

			<p>I checked the original story, and at least they had enough integrity to provide links to both a pro- and con-Amendment web site. I do find their arguments rather interesting. The &#8220;vote Yes&#8221; to end AA crowd says, &#8220;Proposal 424 DOES NOT&hellip;Eliminate outreach or true equal opportunity programs.&#8221; The &#8220;vote No&#8221; crowd says, &#8220;Initiative Measure 424 on the Nov. 4 ballot would strip away important tools for preserving equal opportunity in Nebraska.&#8221; Really? Quotas and preferences are &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221;??? I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind with the pro-AA groups (at least the one mentioned after the article): they are diversicrats with an agenda. From their web site: &#8220;Nebraskans United is a group of concerned citizens &hellip; committed to promoting equality, fairness, and diversity in the state of Nebraska.&#8221; So they are explicitly promoting diversity, which for whatever reason is supposed to be good for the state (I want to puke). According to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s web site, Nebraska is 88.9% White, only 4.0% black (and the vast majority are in Omaha and Lincoln - the Census Bureau&rsquo;s site says 82% of blacks live in one of those two cities). Funny, everything seems to be working just fine here with a substantial White majority. Why should we louse it up with diversity?</p>

			<p><i>Prohibit state and local governments from giving preferential treatment to people on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.</i></p>
<p>Jared Taylor has long said that if we eliminate Affirmative Action and the Fair Housing Act, most of these problems would solve themselves. I tend to agree: whites would gravitate toward whites, blacks toward blacks, etc.</p>

			<p>what&rsquo;s most amazing about winning this suit against the diversity tyrants is that the judge who took the case is a pretty liberal female judge.  My hats off to you Judge Flowers.</p>

			<p> If diversity is such a good thing: and these rich people are so willing to spend so much money on it to get more blacks and other groups to dilute the white population. Why do you never hear about them screaming to dilute the places where other than whites live?<br>
 The race war has been waged against the whites ever since Eisenhoower sent the troops to Arkansas to take down the whites that were trying to fight school integration.</p>

			<p>Some people just don&rsquo;t like democracy. The very idea of the people deciding an important state policy scares them - they want some elite types deciding what is right for the people of the state. </p>
<p>The fact is that in this Land of the Free its actually supposed to be the people that ultimately rule. That lawsuit was an insult to the people of Nebraska. </p>

			<p>Gee, I hope the Nebraska judges decision won&rsquo;t be too hard mentally on Robert Reich, who doesn&rsquo;t want any government help to go to &#8220;white males&#8221;. There are times I cannot even believe that this is the country I grew up in. </p>

			<p> The decision will only stand until it gets to the SCOTUS. The Supremes will always knock down any ballot driven inititative they do not like. But throw out any and all cases forcing Obama to prove his place of birth.</p>

<p>I share your views on Buffet. He has been very sheltered both geographically and socially from the realities of blacks. Note how like Gates he is mainly concerned in charitable pursuits overseas like Africa. What about helping ordinary Americans that helped make him so rich? </p>
