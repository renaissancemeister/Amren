			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leigh Remizowski, New York Daily News, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frank Borzellieri hasn&rsquo;t served on a school board since 2004, but he still has a bone to pick with some former colleagues.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s airing his pent-up frustrations in a new book, &#8220;Lynched: A Conservative&rsquo;s Life on a New York City School Board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t enough for the other members of the board to have me outnumbered and vote me down,&#8221; said the often-controversial Borzellieri.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tried to ruin my career and silence me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book, published Monday, recounts his 11-year stint as a board member of Queens&rsquo; District 24, encompassing Elmhurst, Corona, Ridgewood, Glendale, Middle Village and Maspeth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his book, Borzellieri, 46, now a journalism professor at St. John&rsquo;s University and a resident of Ridgewood, calls his fellow board members hypocrites for voting against the opinions he believes reflected those of his constituents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his book, Borzellieri recounts his version of when, in 1994, he compiled a list of books  &mdash;  including &#8220;Daniel Boone: Man of the Forests&#8221;  &mdash;  that he believed should be used in Queens schools.</p>
<p>On the other hand, books like &#8220;Jambo Means Hello: A Swahili Alphabet Book&#8221; should be banned, he said.</p>
<p>Other members of the board disagreed, and none of the 15 books on Borzellieri&rsquo;s reading list ever made it onto school library shelves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state of education today is bad,&#8221; Borzellieri said. &#8220;Without me on the board to bring attention to it, it&rsquo;s even worse.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I remember when Frank Borzellieri sat on Queens District 24.  I voted for him every time he came up for re-election and encouraged my friends, family &amp; neighbors to do likewise.  </p>
<p>I also vividly remeember several high-ranking members of the Conservative Party of the State of NY (a party I used to be active in) telling me (in private) that while they agreed with what he was saying, they thought he was &#8220;nuts&#8221; for going public with his beliefs.</p>
<p>That in a nutshell is the reason why this country is the demographic nightmare it is today: White cowardice!  All other reasons are secondary at best.  Everyone here should remember that fact.</p>

			<p>I just finished reading Lynched.  Borzellieri was a one man army facing down the multicultural monster during his 11 year tenure on the School Board of District 24 in NYC.  He is man of considerable intelligence, great tenacity and courage and unwavering conviction. But most importantly, Borzellieri is an inspiration for all of us that want to stand, fight and take back this once great country.  </p>
<p>It would be a great loss for America if Borzellieri&rsquo;s political ambitions ended with the School Board.</p>

<p>Oh yeah whites are cowards. Like those white marines (big time cowards who are fighting for your freedom in Iraq/Afganistan, those white army personnel who are taking on missions that they know they will most likely not come back from. Or may be all those white police officers who patrol some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America. People who choose not to have kids are wise. Schools are over crowded and it&rsquo;s too expensive to send them to a private school.</p>
<p>I went to school with blacks and some whites got into fights with gangbangers there.</p>
<p>DONT EVER CALL WHITE COWARDS OR EVEN IMPLY WHITES HAVE A COWARD MINDSET.</p>

<p>Those Marines are not &#8220;fighting for your freedom in Iraq/Afghanistan&#8221; for the simple fact neither country is a threat to this one.  The threat comes from within.</p>
<p>The fact that SOME Whites show moxie in dealing with our enemies does not detract from my original contention that Whites AS A RULE show cowardice HERE AT HOME when dealing with non-Whites.  Where are the large numbers of Whites demanding their elected officials do something about black crime or latino illegal immigration?  They don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem expressing their views on these subjects in private.</p>
<p>I shall continue to call Whites cowards (a valid observation), your typing in capital letters notwithstanding.</p>

			<p>Whites _are_ cowards because they are afraid to speak about what is obvious.  Indignation at the fact does not change it.  It&rsquo;s not because they are inherently cowardly people, that&rsquo;s for sure.  It&rsquo;s because they have been indoctrinated to believe that speaking the truth about these issues is unacceptable.</p>

I don`t know what to call it then but there were some great pictures of Whites cowering inside a pastry shop in France while Islamic rioters were rampaging outside&hellip;Think it might have been on The Brussels Journal website.</p>

			<p> The majority of white parents in San Francisco send their kids to Catholic of private schools, even though they pay ultra high property taxes to support a school system here that caters to students of color only,and not to white students. When it comes to voting for the school board, they are totally brain dead, and they vote in white Marxist Liberals or minority ethnic chauvanists.We have had a few really good candidates, but they never were elected.</p>

			<p>I also own a copy of Lynched.</p>
<p>That the schools and the media are hell-bent on destroying White Western Civilization and the White race is not in dispute.  These leftist institutions have been responsible for untold damage, indoctrinating and brain washing the American people, especially our children in anti-White, anti-Western doctrine for the last four decades.  How else could a racist socialist be elected to the presidency.</p>
<p>Frank battled the hideous leftist monsters on the school board for 11 years.  He fought the good fight against the very things that are destroying and tearing Western Civilization asunder  &mdash;   multiculturalism, militant homosexuals, bi-ligualism (that does exactly the opposite of what it promises), worship of the likes of Che Guevara and MLK and the vilification of the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>From the book description: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; When a radical homosexual district teacher was discussing his perversions in front of his fourth grade class, Frank Borzellieri was alone in trying to stop him&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For this, the liberal Whites on the school board vowed to destroy him and his career and Frank constantly needed police and security escorts to and from meetings because of threats against him. </p>
<p>Frank points out that all of his liberal White opponents on the school board lived in lily-White neighborhoods far from the blacks and hispanics of District 24.  He writes that they freely, openly pilloried, slandered and smeared him with complete immunity yet when he tried to defend himself, state his position or fight back he was regularly shouted down.</p>
<p>In Lynched, Frank describes the impossible, Sisyphean task of fighting the irrational demons on the school board.  For this, for trying to slay the beast, he was excoriated, maligned and had his life threatened.  </p>
<p>For bravely standing up for reason, sanity, common sense, honor  &mdash;  something many of us are afraid to do, with good reason, Frank is an American Hero.    <br>
 <br>
By far, IMO, Lynched, Sowell&rsquo;s Inside American Education and Class Warfare by Martin Rochester are the three best books about the insane asylum that is our current educational system.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t ever call whites cowards&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>It pains me to say it&hellip;but they exist. They are the enemy. Any coward is. No matter what color they are. Since you are quoting warfare, let me respond in kind.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one of the first rules of combat&hellip;Identify your opponent and never underestimate him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like using the term &#8220;coward&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; in the same sentence no more than you do. But these lowlifes will take you for everything you got and then some. They will do it in the most cowardly way possible. They will never confront you face to face. Unless it&rsquo;s in a courtroom or the police are near by.</p>
<p>The is the true definition of a coward. And if they can&rsquo;t get to you personally, they&rsquo;ll have minorities do it for them. Make no mistake, they will will NOT side with you, they will NOT be turned. They want you and your ideals gone. They will NOT comprimise. They will NOT fight you in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>They WILL lie and cheat to undermine everything your ancestors fought for. My ancestors came to this country in the 1600&rsquo;s. They have fought in virtually every conflict this nation has endured. But you know what&hellip;?</p>
<p>THEY DON&rsquo;T CARE! The coward thinks like this. The coward works like this. It&rsquo;s what they do, it&rsquo;s all they do. No basic respect, no common decency, no morals whatsoever. And above all, no grasp of where they came from. Nor do they care.</p>
<p>Now you can see why liberals and their minorities get along so well. Misery loves company&hellip;especially at someone else&rsquo;s expense. The true moniker of any coward. Especially ungrateful whites. The worst turncoat of all.</p>
<p>I admire your fire and tenacity. We need individuals such as yourself to mount the upcoming cause. Your sense of Nationalism is the Patriotism that needs to be further promoted.</p>
<p>Amercanism is a culture all it&rsquo;s own. Liberal whites will tell you otherwise. The will argue till they&rsquo;re blue in the face that America, it&rsquo;s ideals, it&rsquo;s sense of history is moraly corrupt and reprehensible. For being a Nationalist, they&rsquo;ll call you every name in the book.</p>
<p>They will use the First Amendment as a weapon to bury you. Make no mistake about this.</p>
<p>But I do sympathize with your post 100%. Personally, I don&rsquo;t consider traitorous liberals white any longer. They may look it but they&rsquo;re not. Hope you understand&hellip;</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you again!</p>

<p>True, but I would add that they also know that speaking the truth is potentialy very dangerous to their reputations, jobs, and general welfare. Being a coward is one thing, but being stupid in the face of reality is another. Bravery and cowardice are often confused.</p>

			<p>Can we get back to the original discussion, which is the Borzellieri book &#8220;Lynched.&#8221; I just read it and it is an incredible story of what Borzellieri had to go throuh on the school board. This was a board which stuffed the libraries and classrooms with multicultural garbage but banned Borzellieri&rsquo;s proposal to add Eurocentric books like &#8220;Paul Revere&rsquo;s Ride&#8221; and Daniel Boone.&#8221; Borzellieri stood up to all this. He voted against bilingual education but was always outvoted.<br>
The importance I think of the book is how he tells in detail what he tried to do and how the liberals tried to stop him. Thi is a MUSt read. It was great.</p>
