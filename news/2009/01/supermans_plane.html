<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28543087/">Superman&rsquo;s Planet Is Racially Diverse &mdash; Finally</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Brady, Newsarama, January 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For those keeping their eyes open, there was a welcome return in last week&rsquo;s Superman #683 comic book (featuring 100,000 Kryptonians like Superman coming to earth) &mdash; non-white Kryptonians were clearly shown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} By and large, superheroes are still the domain of the idealized white man (and woman). For the character&rsquo;s first 30 years, Superman&rsquo;s homeworld of Krypton was all-white. It was only in 1971 &mdash; 33 years after Superman&rsquo;s debut in 1938 &mdash; that the first non-white Kryptonian was seen. A few months later, the idea of non-white Kryptonians was expanded upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;In issue #239, a two-page map showed that Kryptonians of color had an island all to themselves, which is pretty embarrassing,&#8221; says Mark Waid, Boom! Studios Editor-in-Chief, occasional DC Comics writer, and pretty much expert in all things Superman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cringe to tell you this, but the Kryptonians of Color were all on &lsquo;Vathlo Island, Home of a Highly Advanced Black Race.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t until the mid-70s, when more &lsquo;World of Krypton&rsquo; back-up stories ran more regularly, that we really saw any ethnicity whatsoever on the planet.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I thought the non-whites WERE the Krypton.  It certainly seems that way to me, when observing modern-day America and Europe.</p>
<p>BTW, Obama is on the cover of the latest Spider-Man:</p>

<p>Which makes me wonder how Michelle Obama will be thought of as Wonder Woman.</p>

<p>Well at least they&rsquo;re segregated from the mainstream population.  I would imagine that Vathlo Island looks alot like Haiti with delapidated buildings, open sewers and cringing poverty.</p>

			<p><i> It wasn&rsquo;t until the mid-70s&hellip;that we really saw any ethnicity whatsoever on the planet.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Notice the not-so-subtle self-putdown. Apparently whites are of no ethnicity.  </p>
<p>Anyway, logically speaking, why would we expect another planet to be a perfect mirror image of our own anyway?</p>
<p>The real problem with all this &#8220;diversity&#8221; in fiction is, where do you draw the line? If a few black Kryptonians are good, aren&rsquo;t more better? Why should it be just a smattering of black characters? Is that not in itself racist? Shouldn&rsquo;t at least half be black or hispanic or asian? Maybe non-whites should be the majority!</p>
<p>Another problem is, as we constantly see on television, how often should a non-white character be portrayed as stupid or a bad guy? Studies have shown that the number of black criminals on television in no way reflects their percentage in real life. Similarly, stupid &#8220;comedy relief&#8221; characters in ads are invariably shown as white. To show them as black would be &#8220;perpetuating racist stereotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lose-lose game for whites, because no matter how they portray non-whites, they will forever be criticized for it. </p>

			<p>It seems the Kryptonians had the right idea in #239.  Put &#8216;em all on their own island and let them pretend to fly around the pyramids.  I just hope the Kryptonians remembered to evacuate all the White farmers from Vathlo Island first. </p>

			<p>Keep it up. Most of DC comics subscribers are White.  Blacks don&rsquo;t read comics, blacks don&rsquo;t read ANYTHING.  This little gem along with a possible nappy &#8220;Wonda&#8221; Woman movie (played by Beyonce) in the works and your 60 year old company will be out of business before you know it.  </p>

&#8216;Black culture&rsquo; (an oxymoron) is little more than a perversion and expropriation of white culture.</p>
<p>The Black Golden Rule applies: That which is white must be made black. That which is black must remain black.</p>

			<p>At first I thought this story sounded silly, you know well done fictional alien blacks for gaining some equality.<br/>
But looking into it further, sci fi fiction and film has always followed real life events and fears.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction_films#1920s" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_fiction_films#1920s</a></p>
<p>In this case 100,000 angry multi-racial Kryptonians with super powers fly to earth angry at earths anti-Kryptonian laws and who are void of supermans sense of moral self control.</p>
<p>Sounds profilic and metaphoric.<br/>
Except the only superpowers are in their heads, unless the ability to dunk a basketball is now considered a superpower.<br/>
Either way this comic books writer(s?) must also feel that &#8220;the times, they are a changing&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This is not DC&rsquo;s first foray into political correctness by a long shot. In the 1980s in a &#8220;special edition&#8221; comic, they had Superman thoroughly humiliated in a boxing match by Mohammed Ali. Ali was, and is, a &#8220;good guy,&#8221; of course, but to keep earth from being destroyed by aliens, he had to fight Superman. But doesn&rsquo;t Superman have super strength? It was stripped from him by the same aliens so that he was no stronger than a normal white man. And so of course he was thoroughly bloodied by the superior Ali. Even then, long before Amren came around and my racial deprogramming, I saw it as a pathetic piece of pandering to political correctness.</p>

			<p>See, this is why Magneto&rsquo;s Brotherhood of Mutants is so much more my speed than anything in the DC-verse. My brothers and I had so many rainy day discussions about mutant powers and who to fight for. I respect the X-Men, but the Brotherhood is for whom I would fight; fighting for the X-Men is like fighting on the side of the Neanderthals thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>You are so right! Even their vaunted &#8220;Hip-Hop&rsquo;s&#8221; top selling &#8220;artist&#8221; of all time is a White Guy - namely Eminem! So-called Black Culture is nothing more than an illusion; nothing but rank mimickry combined with the general glorification of the most trivial, mundane and meaningless nonsense - so long as it is Black nonsense!     </p>

<p>&#8220;The story takes place in Washington on January 20, the day of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, and involves one of Spider-Man&rsquo;s oldest foes trying to prevent Obama taking the oath of office, according to Marvel&#8221;<br/>
I guess Venom or the Green Goblin must also (possibly) post the odd comment at Amren.<br/>

			<p>I heard on the radio this morning that Obama was a Spiderman fan. He&rsquo;s going to be part of some type of broadcasting where a fake and a real Obama are at the inauguration and Spiderman has to find out which one is the true Obama. It suits. Will we ever know the real Obama? </p>
<p>I also heard that Obama was fighting to be able to use his blackberry without releasing it to the public. He&rsquo;s no different than any other President. Everything should be public knowledge someday. This is why other Presidents did not use email.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Throughout its rather ignoble history, Vathlo Island remained undeveloped and unexplored by writers, which is both good and bad, probably. One interesting idea that was floated in the very brief mention of Vathlo in Krypton&rsquo;s history was that there was no slave trade on Krypton, which is why races didn&rsquo;t really mix  &mdash; or at least why some of Jor-El&rsquo;s best friends weren&rsquo;t black.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is too funny.  Krypton is an alien world and Kryptonians are not human beings and dark skinned Kryptonians are not Africans!  Why would the discussion of slavery or the slave trade ever be injected into such a story?  Do the slant eyed Kryptonians work in garment cleaning establishments, nail salons and Kryptonese restaurants? </p>

<p>Watching fantasy shows is all fine and dandy but just realize they are fantasy and that they are sending subtle messages to your brain to impair your sense of judgment and morality.  It&rsquo;s no accident that there is only one non-holographic White male in the show&rsquo;s cast and he&rsquo;s married to a mixed race Klingon. Same thing with Deep Space Nine, only one White male on the cast (the doctor is an Arab) and he&rsquo;s married to an oriental.  There have been plots in these Star Trek spinoffs that deal with love for a person of the same sex or that it&rsquo;s wrong to criticize another culture for euthanizing their elderly or murdering millions of people because they&rsquo;re a food source.  I could go on and on but just be aware of the brainwashing.  The original series wasn&rsquo;t really multicult other than having a black and Japanese on the bridge crew.  The Next Generation was alright for the most part because it premiered in the 80&rsquo;s before PC really took off, otherwise Whoopi wouldn&rsquo;t have played a waitress on the show.  </p>

Surely they have some vacancies and hire on merit (death star design flaws aside).</p>
<p>When the coalition of the good, had members who looked like fish with big bulging eyes and others who looked like they had gills or potato salad for skin.</p>
<p>Hmmm, so homogeneous=bad guys,<br/>
collection of circus freaks=good guys.</p>

			<p>I must disagree. As a Star trek fan Star trek  is multiracial! It brags about having the first interracial kiss on TV and what is the United Federation of Planets but a galactic United Nations? Did you miss the red and yellow streamer strips on UFP ships? What other ideology on earth uses red and yellow? Gene Roddenberry says he intended the Klingons to be the vikings of interstellar space.Have you not noticed how the Klingon flag looks and the Viking like furs and leather they wear, not to mention their code of honor. I always root for the Klingons against the federation!</p>
