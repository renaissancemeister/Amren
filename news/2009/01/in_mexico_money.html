<h1>In Mexico, Money From Relatives Abroad Dries Up</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen and Julie Watson, AP, January 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Money sent from immigrants working in the U.S. to their home country is Mexico&rsquo;s second-largest source of foreign income after oil.</p>
<p>But that funding source dropped 2.2 percent in the first half of 2008, according to a report from the central bank. One of Mexico&rsquo;s largest banks said this month that it expects an overall 2 percent decline to $23.5 billion when the final 2008 numbers are reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>As the U.S. recession deepens, Vargas is among a wave of immigrants who have cut back on what they send home  &mdash;  resulting in what&rsquo;s expected to be the first annual decline in so-called &#8220;remittances&#8221; to Mexico since the country&rsquo;s central bank began keeping track of payments 13 years ago.</p>
<p>The thousands of dollars Vargas has sent to Iguala, Mexico, during the past 17 years have allowed her parents to finish building their three-bedroom house and her mother to see a private doctor instead of going to one of Mexico&rsquo;s overcrowded and often inept public clinics.</p>
<p>Vargas remembers a time when she could send up to $500 a month. Lately, it&rsquo;s just $50 to $80 here and there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the lush mountain city of Iguala, mango, orange and other fruit trees grow in abundance, but people struggle to make ends meet. Vargas&rsquo; father, Alberto Rodriguez, 56, has not been able to find a job in more than two months.</p>
<p>The construction worker used to have steady work in the city, where rebar protrudes from the tops of cinder-block homes that are built in stages as money arrives from family members in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long lines of families waiting to pick up remittances at Western Union have all but disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The migrants used to send back money to their families, who would hire someone to build a second floor or paint their houses,&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;But now everyone over there is losing their jobs, and down here the jobs are disappearing as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodriguez and his wife, Magdalena Jimenez, 56, live off money earned from selling candy, cigarettes, sliced cucumbers with chile powder and other snacks to workers on shift changes outside a local factory.</p>

			<p>A 2% drop in remittances is supposed to be a lot?  Sending only 23.5 billion dollars home instead of 2% more has caused a recession south of the border?</p>
<p>They make it sound like the economy is collapsing because of the lower remittances, which are really negligible.</p>
<p>This story reads like the remittances abroad dropped to the point where maybe 50 or 75 cents is sent now and then instead of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>These MSM journalists are not only agenda driven, they&rsquo;re not very bright either.</p>

			<p>A regular poster here at AR speculated that some of this subprime mortgage money was being used for remittances, not all of it was being used to purchase real estate.  That theory would make sense in light of this story, because subprime mortgages are almost non-existent at the moment.</p>

			<p>This will very likely contribute to the collapse of the Mexican government and chaos in Mexico.</p>

			<p>In the end, values of homes, quality of education and safety from crime is a direct inverse relationship between Latinos/Blacks populations and where Europeans live.</p>
<p>Take any map in a state, city, US or abroad and measure quality of life and the amount of Blacks and Latinos live.</p>

			<p>This is why we can&rsquo;t expect the bad economy to clean up our illegal immigrant mess. The Mexican economy sucks, too, so out of work illegals don&rsquo;t have much of a reason to return home. The 2% fall in remittances is in line with other surveys showing that only about 2% of Mexicans plan to return home.</p>
<p>Enforcement will only occur when the economy gets so bad that Americans start to actually want - or should I say need? - the jobs that illegal immigrants are doing; when jobs like landscaping, painting, and burger flipping again go to kids saving money for college.</p>
<p>The Democrats are doing their best to stop anything that would result in Mexicans and other illegals from leaving the country. They&rsquo;re extending unemployment benefits to nearly a year so that Americans don&rsquo;t actually bother looking for work. They&rsquo;re extending welfare benefits to children of illegals. They&rsquo;re propping up overspending governments in California and elsewhere. They wouldn&rsquo;t all those Democratic government employees to lose their (often worthless) jobs in a fit of frugality, would they?</p>
<p>Except for wasting huge sums of money, in the end it won&rsquo;t matter. The economy is bad and getting worse. The Dow is back down to around 8000. Britain is on the verge of bankruptcy. The members of the European Monetary Union are getting restless. Google &#8220;unemployment&#8221; at Google News and see how bad the stories are. California unemployment jumped nearly a full point in a single month. Some states have unemployment rates north of 10%. Obama, through Treasury nominee Geithner, is starting to beat the trade war drums on China. This is actually a good thing, but it means China will actually have to start using its dollars to buy American-made things instead of lending us money. So borrowing money from the Chinese to prop up our lifestyles will become more difficult.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the economic nirvana of mass immigration has failed and failed big time. It&rsquo;s all over, but the elites won&rsquo;t admit it yet.</p>

			<p>We have already had the &#8220;Day Without Immigrants&#8221;&hellip;.the boycott of work and shopping to force Americans to admit to their economic authority.</p>
<p>To that I always advocate &#8220;Forever Without Gringo&#8221;&hellip;.a boycott of any place of business that employs the bastards. My friends and I will not frequent or shop or do business with any firm, shop, restuarant, grocery, or other business that employs non-Gringos. True, there may be some places where I cannot see who actually works in the kitchen, but if I know they work there, I leave with my money in my pocket. There are too many American small businesses that would appreciate my patronage. I definitely do not want any of my spending to end up as remitances to Mexico or Latin America. We need that money to stay in the community, creating jobs for other Americans.<br>

			<p>I thought (as liberals would have you believe) that remittances were being used for BARE ESSENTIALS such as food, medicine, rent etc. Now it seems as if it is going towards &#8220;building their three-bedroom house&#8221;. I wonder what else this money is going for? LCD TVs? Cars? Gadgets? The meaning of poverty sure has changed hasnt it? </p>

			<p>As long as one able bodied American remains unemployed not one illegal alien or alien on a work visa belongs in our country. And not one job should be exported overseas.  </p>
<p>This is economic treason and it is leading to the devastation of our economy.  Those responsible must be punished severely.  </p>
<p>Destroying the middle class has always been at the top of the communist agenda and corporate America is leading the charge.  </p>
<p>This can all be reversed overnight with a single congressional bill.  It would give Washington the chance to place Americans first which is something they have not done in a very long time.  It would also prevent Americans from taking the law into our own hands and holding an unresponsive Washington responsible&hellip;    </p>

			<p>Money being sent out of the U.S. should be taxed at a rate of about 50%. That would help put a stop to this insanity. It should be no surprise that this money is being used to build large wealth back in their countries. I&rsquo;ve heard from many illegals that when they get back, they are going to be rich from the American money they send back.</p>
