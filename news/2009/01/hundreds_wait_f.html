			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Knight, San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of people stood in line for hours at San Francisco City Hall on Thursday to be among the first in the nation to receive municipal identification cards regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>The cards, also available in New Haven, Conn., and being considered in other cities, have sparked fury among advocates of stricter immigration laws. They argue cities have no business declaring people residents if they are not in the country legally.</p>
<p>But San Francisco officials and recipients of the cards hailed the new program as a way to connect undocumented immigrants with banks, businesses and city services, such as obtaining health care and checking out library books. They also said it will encourage card holders to report crimes to the police without fear of being arrested or deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really need the identification card,&#8221; said Marvin Martinez, 50, who arrived in the city five months ago from Florida and is originally from Mexico. Martinez, who didn&rsquo;t say whether he was a legal resident, stood in a long line  &mdash;  one made up mostly of Latino men  &mdash;  that snaked down the marble hallway outside the county clerk&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll use it to look for jobs and for school and when the police stop me, I&rsquo;ll have ID to show them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;ll improve things.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People must show proof of identity like a driver&rsquo;s license or foreign passport, as well as proof of residency such as a utility bill or proof of having a child enrolled in the city&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Immigration Reform Law Institute of Washington sued to block the cards on behalf of four San Francisco residents who said the program would aid illegal immigration. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Peter Busch tossed the suit in October.</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform  &mdash;  a national group that wants immigration laws enforced more strongly  &mdash;  said it&rsquo;s ridiculous to create a program to attract more illegal immigrants when most U.S. cities are struggling financially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe San Francisco is the exception to the rule, and they have money to burn  &mdash;  who knows?&#8221; Mehlman said.</p>
<p>City Administrator Ed Lee said the machinery to produce the cards cost $700,000 and staffing will cost $150,000 annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The card is good at some banks and credit unions, some participating businesses offering discounts to cardholders, libraries, to reserve park space and at all city departments and other groups receiving city money.</p>
<p>The cards are not a license to drive, not intended to be used as proof of legal age to buy alcohol or cigarettes, and not accepted by federal agencies.<br>

<p>Friends, if you are a non-Hispanic, heterosexual, Conservative White person currently living in California, I strongly suggest that you leave now. California is bankrupt and conditions there will only become much worse there in the years ahead. </p>
<p>We have already read reports that all state workers must now take two unpaid days of leave each month, indefinitely. That represents about a month&rsquo;s pay in one year. Services are reportedly declining rapidly as California&rsquo;s society comes to reflect *not* a Mexican/American hybrid state, but just purely a Mexican state; one awash with all of the undesirable qualities that make Mexico an undesirable place to live for civilized people.</p>
<p>Today, we have news of far worse financial conditions emerging in California&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20090116/D95OF36O0.html" rel="nofollow">https://apnews.myway.com/article/20090116/D95OF36O0.html</a></p>
<p>excerpt:</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s controller says he will begin a 30-day delay on tax refunds and other payments starting Feb. 1 because the state is running out of money.</p>
<p>Controller John Chiang said Friday he must delay $3.7 billion in payments next month because lawmakers have failed to address California&rsquo;s growing deficit.</p>
<p>With a $41.6 billion shortfall over the next year-and-a-half, the state is on the brink of issuing IOUs.</p>
<p>Chiang says his office must continue education and debt payments but will defer money for tax refunds, student aid, social services and mental health programs.</p>
<p>A severe drop in revenue has left the state&rsquo;s main bank account depleted. The state had been relying on borrowing from special funds and Wall Street investors; those options are no longer available.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>There you have it. We all knew this was coming. There is no place left for them to hide the truth of their balance sheets.</p>
<p>Now, reality has emerged. The corrupt government of California is officially unable to meet its basic, lawful obligations to its taxpayers and legal citizens. This trend will spread to more states very soon. I predict that New York will be next.</p>
<p>Many have predicted for years that multiculturalism and diversity would forever end the economic prosperity of the USA.</p>
<p>There will be no &#8220;bouncing back&#8221; this time. Denizens of the third-world do not bounce back. They wallow in squalor and leech from their cultural, social, and intellectual betters.<br>

			<p>This just makes my blood boil!</p>
<p>&#8220;$700,000 and staffing will cost $150,000 annually&#8221;</p>
<p>OUTRAGEOUS!</p>
<p>I lived in the bay area for about 5 years while in college. Much of the time I felt like I was in a foreign country. </p>
<p>Imagine yourself being the ONLY American in every direction which you cast your gaze and hearing nothing but foreign languages! I can understand why Americans (i.e. whites) would be streaming out of California.</p>
<p>The only question is; where are they gonna run to? Texas for example is down to 48% white too.</p>
<p>What happens when there is nowhere left to run to?</p>
<p>I can hear the bugle call of Robert E Lee!!!</p>

			<p>As is so often stated,&#8221;California is lost&#8221;. The people in charge in Frisco are a big part of the reason. One truth involving immmigration law is apparent  &mdash;  if the citizenry doesn&rsquo;t support it in the most vocal, rabid, and demanding way possible  &mdash;  it will never stop. These political hacks like Gavin Newsom and others will never stop their violation of immigration law. They have got to have their jobs at stake, wherever they live throughtout the nation. There are simply too many arrogant and lawless self centered traitors in power today.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, a recent article in the S.F. Chronical mentions the SFPD is so short on cash that hey have eliminated overtime among homicide detectives. This will leave most murders unsolved. Of further interest, these same detectives will be REQUIRED to attend an all day &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; class given by a transgendered individual freak at a cost of $100,000 to the taxpayers. Is America cooked yet?</p>

			<p>Anyone possessing one of these city ID cards may be safely assumed to be an illegal. Who else would need one? Come to think of it they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> need <i>one</i>; they&rsquo;ll probably get two or three of them&hellip;twice or three times the benefits.</p>

			<p>  As long as there are places for whites to run to, they&rsquo;ll run to. There will eventually be a breaking point for whites when most of the desirable areas are gone, at which time I would hate to be in an invader&rsquo;s shoes. Whites should maintain their neighborhoods and schools with a passion. Minorities should build up their own neighborhoods and not seek to ruin white people&rsquo;s areas. This should be considered bad manners to move into a white guy&rsquo;s neighborhood.</p>

<p>Yes, this is how a first-world society devolves into a third-world society.</p>
<p>Services decline. Standards decline. Quality decreases. Risk increases. Crime increases. Taxes increase. Happenings and habits that are considered rude, uncouth, unsophisticated, classless, and uncivilized become the norm. All of the qualities that would make a civilized person think, &#8220;I would never want to live in Mexico, Africa, Haiti, or Iraq&#8221; have replaced European standards in California and in many other places across America. </p>
<p>American citizens in California must tolerate the lower plateau of living or move and hope the undesirables do not follow them. Of course, they will. Even if they are unable to, the government stands ready to ship in half a million Somalis or more and deposit them in your new town, at your expense.</p>
<p>As many here have stated, the problems we face are endemic. The permanent solution will be very ugly and will test the resolve of weak-minded individuals. I do not think any permanant solution will arrive during my lifetime. </p>
<p>The dangerous White characteristics of altruism and greed are devestating for our race in a multicultural society.</p>
<p>My wife and I spent all day yesterday shopping for better property and insurance rates. Although we have not filed any claims, we have FICO scores of 828 and 835, respectively, and we live low-risk lifestyles in a secured HOA in rural Texas, our Allstate rates suddenly skyrocketed. Risk from all across the country are being reflected and shared. You are paying for the misery being imported into this country. We all are. What happens in California and New York and here in Texas affects everyone. Higher risk, nationally, is reflected in your insurance rates!</p>
<p>Ultimately, we found some acceptable rates for homeowner&rsquo;s coverage and our cars, also with better coverage, with USAA (I am a retired Air Force officer).</p>

<p>I would add that they also see those &#8216;cultural, social and intellectual betters&rsquo; as prey. Is it any wonder that 40% of all new housing in California is behind gates and gun sales are at record levels?</p>
<p>Next for California?    &#8220;&hellip;the governor&rsquo;s most recent budget plan includes $319 million in cuts to public health and welfare programs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I strongly suspect the violent crime rate to skyrocket soon, starting in California, as unemployment and inflation rise sharply. California sinks as huge blocs of non-White voters, as Pat Buchanan has pointed out, continue to vote themselves MORE expensive government services and large, powerful employee unions demand exorbitant salaries and pensions. California&rsquo;s government is spending 40% more than four years ago to support a massive growing underclass that include many illegals and their anchor children.  There is no end in sight.<br>
 <br>
Are you ready for the coming chaos?  I have my &#8216;universal translator&rsquo; loaded and handy.</p>

<p>Even though the mere phrase &#8220;San Francisco officials&#8221; has a ring of increasing hilarity to it, the time has come to consider an enduring and satisfactory solution to the San Francisco problem.</p>
<p>Cutoff all federal funds and cede it to Mexico.     </p>

			<p>&#8220;Cutoff all federal funds and cede [San Fransico] to Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is a good short term solution, but what will happen when all of the super-Liberal, non-Hispanic Whites move to Oregon, Montana, and Colorado and bring their misguided values with them? What will be the solution when they declare that Oregon, Montana, and Colorado are not diverse enough for their tastes and that they are ashamed and embarrassed by the lack of multiculturalism in their new states?</p>
<p>As many have pointed out before, the problems we face are endemic.</p>

			<p>What would you expect from that part of the country?  Rather than waste time on unconstitutional &#8220;hate&#8221; laws, Congress should pass some laws that would put mayors of such cities in jail for refusing to enforce federal law.</p>
