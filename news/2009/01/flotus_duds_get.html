<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17938.html">FLOTUS Duds Get Backlash</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nia-Malika Henderson, The Politico, January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FLOTUS&rsquo;s inaugural outfits sent designers to their drafting tables to design knockoffs and droves went to J.Crew to get those snazzy leather green gloves. But not everyone is happy with her choices. The Black Artists Association is chiding FLOTUS for not choosing any African-American designers.</p>
<p>They will send a letter to FLOTUS&rsquo;s office and appeal to her to include items from black designers in her wardrobe. BAA Cofounder Amnau Eele, who was a former runway model told Women&rsquo;s Wear Daily:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s fine and good if you want to be all &#8216;Kumbaya&rsquo; and &#8216;We Are the World&rsquo; by representing all different countries. But if you are going to have Isabel Toledo do the inauguration dress, and Jason Wu do the evening gown, why not have Kevan Hall, B Michael, Stephen Burrows or any of the other black designers do something too?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Well, a black designer couldn&rsquo;t have done any worse.  The one she wore for the inauguration looked like it was adorned with cheap dollar store gold glitter, and the nightgown looked like a one-handled potato sack, or a resown drape.</p>

<p>  Maybe FLOTUS does not want to be seen as only supporting Black designers or maybe FLOTUS just liked the other designs better.</p>

  Blacks need to stop expecting set asides and quotas for Blacks and compete equal people instead of entitlement demanding people.</p>

			<p>Our country is crashing and the media puts out this garbage?  I don&rsquo;t care what Michelle Obama is wearing, however, I will add that FUBU doesn&rsquo;t make designer gowns.</p>

Funny how everything must now be black. Black and only black. Can&rsquo;t taint black with no white.</p>
<p>See the Black Golden Rule:</p>
<p>The Black Golden Rule: That which is white must be made black. That which is black must remain black.</p>

			<p>&hellip; Because airbrushing, gaudy neons, leopard skins, Baby Phat, FUBU or Rocawear would be nowhere near appropriate for the occasion.  </p>

<p>Because maybe those &#8220;black designers&#8221; just don&rsquo;t cut the mustard, in the same way?</p>
<p>Laughably, what should be a story of little consequence, most likely is the prophetic epitaph for this administration: &#8216;The Changes Were Never Possibly or Reasonably, Ever Going To Be Enough; The Hopes Only Exacerbated That Fact.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Or as Richard III put it so well: &#8220;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>I mean, after that garb she wore on November 4th and the flogging she got in the press, guess she thought maybe she might go more caucasian. After all, her husband is half caucasian. </p>
<p>Unlike many of her supporters, she has certain value in caucasian creativity, productivity and design&hellip;..as do most successful individuals. </p>

			<p>Maybe the only thing that can save Comrade BO, is a manufactured crisis?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he unleash Godzilla and Rodan on Tokyo, or as he normally calls them: Michelle and Hillary.</p>
<p>That &#8220;common enemy&#8221; might get some unifying change, if not hope, going for that fool and his followers!</p>

			<p>But, but &hellip; I thought that by voting for Obama we would finally end the racial bickering and ethnic demands in the USA.  But, all I&rsquo;ve heard since Obama got elected is Black this and Black that.  It seems that racial bickering has only gotten worse, not better.  I wonder if my &#8220;white-guilt&#8221; vote for Obama was for naught?  </p>

			<p>Michelle Obama already looked bad enough at the inauguration to embarrass this country for years.  Dressing her by Black designers would&rsquo;ve merely highlighted how far behind Blacks are from Whites in the taste department.</p>

			<p>Of course.  Just as Princess Diana used UK designers, so Michelle should use black designers.  After all, they are a separate nation, with their own culture.  It&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s an American or something. </p>

			<p>The inauguration outfit was an unflattering color for anyone.The off white dress for the balls was very flattering.The Africian designers may want to design oufits for her in those screaming prints which are not flattering  on any black women&hellip;.</p>

			<p>This is just the start of it. Blacks will be whining for the next four years anytime they believe blacks have been slighted in some way. They will try and keep Obama and his wife, in check by reminding them you owe us for our vote.</p>

			<p>This is yet another example of the insanity bestowed by &#8220;pro black liberalism&#8221;.<br>
Imagine if a white designer chastised a white candidate for wearing a black garment produced by a black company&hellip;<br>
Enough is enough,we as a nation are thru,FINISHED!</p>

			<p>She and her husband asked for this type of harrassment from blacks.  They were a part of the black nationalism movement.  All of their choices in life have been to further the cause of blacks.  Of course they should harass her.</p>

<p>As will the Mexicans&hellip; many illegals who also (illegally) voted for Obama. The FUN part comes when Mexicans and Blacks end up competing against each other. </p>

<p>Is that why so many white suburban kids are wearing ghetto attire, listening to rap music, watching black tv shows, dressing in tight miny skirts. In America it is normal for people to copy other peoples style.</p>

<p>Probably because they are too dumbed down by liberal thinking, that p.c. slop stuffed into them through their school years&hellip; to be able to think rationally anymore. That plus being afraid to be thought of as &#8220;racist.&#8221; I am a White man, and damned proud of it. I wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead listening to [c]rap music, wearing clothes favored by Blacks. I won&rsquo;t even PAY to go to a movie, because I refuse to subsidize the Hollywood Propaganda Mill trying to convince us all we&rsquo;re not &#8220;with it&#8221; if we don&rsquo;t pal around with Blacks (who, contrary to REALITY, are invariable portrayed as being smarter than their White friends). Those ridiculous TV commercials doing the same job of trying to brainwash Americans.</p>
<p>Tell me this, &#8220;rational thinker&#8221;&hellip; WHERE is the rationality you claim? Certainly most of what you&rsquo;ve posted indicates the diametic opposite&hellip; you being hopelessly &#8220;irrational.&#8221; Or is this logical thinking over your head?</p>
