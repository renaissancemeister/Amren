<h1>Many Eager to Document &#8216;Obama Effect&rsquo;</h1>

<p>University researchers have already documented an &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; in which the gap between scores earned by blacks and whites on a 20-question test given before Obama&rsquo;s nomination virtually disappeared when the exam was taken after his acceptance speech and again after election.</p>
<p>Though The New York Times noted that the study has yet to undergo peer review, the researchers concluded that Obama&rsquo;s success helped blacks overcome anxieties about racial stereotypes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama serves as a national role model,&#8221; said state Sen. Frederica Wilson, of Miami, who runs a minority dropout prevention program. &#8220;Children who have a vision of themselves in the future value themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Wilson recently took 100 black boys to Tallahassee to watch Florida&rsquo;s electors cast votes for Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could see a change in how these boys hold their heads up,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;This is a turning point in the lives and perceptions of black men and boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s presidency changes everything. And nothing. Walking down to the National Mall before the inauguration, I passed a black man in ratty clothes, pressed up against a doorway. He was urinating on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Now researchers have documented what they call an Obama effect, showing that a performance gap between African-Americans and whites on a 20-question test administered before Mr. Obama&rsquo;s nomination all but disappeared when the exam was administered after his acceptance speech and again after the presidential election.</p>

<p>Dr. Friedman [Ray Friedman, a management professor at Vanderbilt University] and his fellow researchers, David M. Marx, a professor of social psychology at San Diego State University, and Sei Jin Ko, a visiting professor in management and organizations at Northwestern, have submitted their study for review to The Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Dr. Friedman said.</p>

			<p>If anything, I think the Obama Effect will take them in the other direction, in that they won&rsquo;t do as well as they did before.  Because they&rsquo;ll figure that they run things now, that they&rsquo;ll get whatever they want just by asking for it, or taking it.</p>

			<p>Many documented facts about Obama and his dubious past surfaced before and during the election process. Those facts were promptly swept away and ignored by the vast majority of the media. </p>
<p>Likewise, does anyone here honestly think that any facts about intelligence that are unfavorable to Blacks will be presented by the media? Of course not! Every Tom, Dick, Harry, and Tyrone will come out and claim that Obama has positively affected the scores of Blacks by giving them hope&hellip; and the media will report it as fact. The gullible will buy into it because that&rsquo;s the kind of news they want to hear.</p>

			<p>&#8220;University researchers have already documented an &ldquo;Obama effect&rdquo; in which the gap between scores earned by blacks and whites on a 20-question test given before Obama&rsquo;s nomination virtually disappeared when the exam was taken after his acceptance speech and again after election.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is really hilarious.  These lefties just won&rsquo;t face reality and prefer to manipulte facts and figures any way they can to support an ideology that is based on false premises and is totally insupportable.</p>
<p>In spite of all evidence and proof to the contrary, they have always held that all blacks need are role models and the achievement gap will disappear as if by magic, just as they claim this magical event did.</p>
<p>After appointing several black AA types to the highest positions in the last several years, there&rsquo;s been a continued disintegration of black society.  Surely, if their claims were valid, having a black general Secretary of State, followed by a black woman would have shown some improvement in overall black attitudes and aspirations, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything but continued deterioration. </p>
<p>Just another bunch of university fools, giving all of academia a bad image with their unscientific evaulations which are easily proven wrong.</p>
<p>Projections are that one of the next big economic hits is going to be on higher education, causing funding to bottom out, requiring an elimination of many programs and frivolous researches like this one.</p>
<p>Could this economic juggernaught dismantle PC programs that have been the curse of sensible whites all these years?  I know I certainly hope so.  In fact I&rsquo;d like to see all institutions cut back to a skeleton crew, so they won&rsquo;t have enough time and money to pursue their idiotic flights of fancy. <br>

<p>But not the WAIS-IV and other similarly quantified intelligence tests, I presume; what about personality tests, like the MMPI? Just this &#8220;20-question test&#8221; shows this so-called &#8220;Obama effect,&#8221; in other words? </p>
<p>Honestly, I must pause to laugh now!</p>
<p>Sadly, I must also pause to shudder while shaking my head in horrified disgust!</p>
<p>We have seen such nonsense before in other countries with a cultist dogma and a &#8220;messiah:&#8221; Mao&rsquo;s China, Stalin&rsquo;s Russia, Hitler&rsquo;s Germany; the list could just go on and on. The abnormal becomes the normal, the sane becomes a whimsy for contemptuous berating, and the most obscene idiocies become the wisdom of the ages. But just remember, at least the children have it good as long as they keep on singing:</p>

We&rsquo;ve heard this every time someone introduces &#8216;a new teaching method that&rsquo;s guaranteed to close the achievement gap&rsquo;. The initial reports allegedly show striking improvements and the program is hailed, usually by the New York Times, as THE answer we&rsquo;ve all be looking for.</p>
<p>Of course, once the initial excitement dies down, it turns out the numbers weren&rsquo;t as dramatic as they were first reported. There appears to have been some fudging here and there. No one can reproduce the results using the same methods. Eventually we find out there was out and out fraud and there was no closing of the achievement gap. </p>
<p>Place your bets that the &#8216;Obama Effect&rsquo; exists only in the minds of people who are compelled to believe in fantasies or lie.</p>

			<p>Did the same thing happen when Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe became president of South Africa an Zimbabwe(rhodesia). The fact is many blacks in both countries if they had any sense would wish the president of both countries were still white ( that&rsquo;s if they had any sense).</p>

			<p>I was amazed by this article! What can I say, I&rsquo;m largely ignorant of behavioural psychology, so I cannot make an informed statement one way or the other. What I do know of racial differences in intelligence, however, does show that there is precious little to suggest that higher self-esteem among African-Americans will translate into higher academic achievement. Sounds suspiciously like anomalous data being used to back up foregone conclusions if you ask me. I&rsquo;m not trusting anything the media come out with &hellip; I suggest that AR get Michael Levin and J. Philippe Rushton to review Dr. Friedman&rsquo;s survey!</p>

			<p> This deep, passionate, all consuming love fest will eventually start to wane. People will eventually start to ask &#8220;What have I done? What posessed me to adore this person so much? Love makes people see the things they want to see, and ignore the rest.<br>
 The next step is to blame the person and get angry. At that point; nothing they do is right. Every statement is a lie, every gesture is denigrating and then eventually hate sets in with a vengance.<br>
 Love can sometimes be compared to temporary insanity. The mainstream media whipped up the passion and the majority of Americans swallowed it hook, line and sinker.<br>
 May God have mercy on us, for we know not what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

			<p>Be skeptical of every study that has not been peer reviewed.  Be even more skeptical if independent researchers have not reached the same conclusion as the original study. Researchers very often falsely come to the conclusions they think they will find, want to find, or are paid to find.</p>
<p>For the college folks, take a course called Research Methods from someone who didn&rsquo;t get hired because of affirmative (anti-White) action and has real world study making and reviewing experience.</p>
<p>Remember it&rsquo;s one thing to say that everyone is equal on a piece of paper.  It is a whole other thing to prove it outside of a labratory.</p>
<p>Who are the excuse makers for non-White success/failure kidding anymore?</p>

			<p>This is so weird I don&rsquo;t even know where to start!  Social scientists can &#8220;prove&#8221; just about anything they want.  Let&rsquo;s see if the Obama Effect lifts the scores of tests such as the SAT among blacks.    </p>

			<p>So, Friedman and Marx claim that racial pride can increase academic scores, instantly.  I don&rsquo;t think that I will invest my dwindling 401K in that theory.  Let&rsquo;s wait until we get a little more data.</p>

			<p>These results are obviously fraudulent, and will be exposed as such.  Do they think none of their peers will discover how worthless their methodology is?  Maybe they actually do think that, given the state of most sociological research since the 50s.  Arthur Jensen and Philippe Rushton will make quick work of it though.  It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether the uncovering of this latest fraud will even be reported when it does eventually occur&hellip;</p>

			<p>Friedman &amp; Marx suggest that the IQ of Africans magically improved after Obama became President.  I remember another theory by a guy named Marx that was equally ridiculous   &mdash;   The same with one of Marx&rsquo;s fellow travelers, Sigmund Freud.  Both theories fooled a lot of people, and caused a lot of suffering.  What&rsquo;s with these guys that makes them spout these insane ideas?  </p>

			<p>The hysteria is spreading.  Will the average cranial volume of Blacks increase now too?  I suspect that this is entirely staged.  These people have been awaiting this moment, so they can offer a &#8220;plausible&#8221; reason for these new results that are in contradiction of a century of research.  It won&rsquo;t matter when their peers cannot replicate their results, because the MSM will trumpet the initial findings and ignore the subsequent dismissal by honest scholars.  </p>

			<p>  Well it may be a little early to document any changes within the Black community. However hopefully President Obama will have a positive affect on the destructive culture too many Blacks have adopted. We&rsquo;ll See. I disagree with all of his policies so far, but may be he can get more black people to be responsible.</p>

			<p>Baloney.  There is absolutely nothing that the election of any individual can do to influence cognitive ability of a large group of people.  This &#8220;gap erasure&#8221; is nothing but left wing feel-goodery, and will be promptly exposed as such by scientists still possessing some shreds of immunity from group-think.</p>

			<p>Were Blacks actually equal to Whites, any &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; would result in a narrowing of the test score gap, not its disappearance.  Even when academic weakness is not due to a cognitive deficit, it will have multiple causes, just as academic excellence is not due solely to one cause.  This is a story line like those teacher movies I hate: Creative teacher comes to wretched school and uplifts thugs and dullards in one year, before being driven out of school by jealous, uncaring administration.  No, improvement is done a little bit at a time, by continuous effort, over a long period.  Too many people expect quick fixes to everything, and imagine that some natural talent will just spring forward, given a chance.  That is the appeal of most commercials, many movies pitched at adolescents and liberals, and American Idol.  Just as BHO is a celebrity, moulded to fit the Black movie hero we&rsquo;ve seen so many times onscreen but never in real life, this &#8220;study&#8221; has lifted its script straight from Hollywood.</p>

We are so lucky to have this man in office. If all this can be done in just a few days we will be living in paradise in just a month or two.</p>

			<p>Thank God we have finally solved the 2,000-yr disparity between Black and White cognition.  We tried so, so many things that didn&rsquo;t seem to work (segregation, integration, re-segregation, Black male-only schools, Afro-centric teaching, Midnight basketball, drug intervention, Anger-management classes, more Black teachers, more black administrators, Ebonics, extended class days, weekend school, charter schools, magnet schools, peer tutoring, After-school programs, sports programs, Black Pride programs, Black History Month, Black TV, Black radio, naming streets and schools after famous blacks, busing, not-busing, community schools, Teach For America, Touchy-feely schools, Boot-camp schools, free lunch programs, pre-natal care, free books, free computers, school uniforms, Kawanza, visits by Jessie Jackson, visits by Al Sharpton, Black mayors, Black Senators, Black astronauts, Black movie stars, black news reporters, black TV actors, Jazz, Soul, Rockin-Roll, Rap, Nelson Mandella, Magic Johnson, black cultural fests, Black student unions, Black dorms, Black lounges, Office of Equal opportunity, Multicultural Officers, Community Police Boards, Watchdog groups, Southern Poverty Law Center, Black is Beautiful, Diversity is our Greatest Strength, Not in our town, Just say no, It Takes a Village, It takes Christianity, It takes Islam, It takes a cop, It takes a bullet, Black Muslims, Tough Love, Summer enrichment programs, Field trips, Affirmative action, Set asides, Earned Income Tax credit, Section Eight housing, Food Stamps, free, child care, free medical care, free college tuition, free legal aid, community activists, massive Third World immigration, and on, and on, and on).</p>
<p>But finally, at last, we have solved the problem.  Blacks will now do as well as whites in school, become responsible citizens, with no crime, no drugs, no anti-social behavior, and no social pathologies.  Whites and Blacks will henceforth love one another, and go holding hands and skipping into our bright, joint multicultural future.  Our long dark night has finally come to an end.  Praise Obama.  Oh Praise Obama.</p>

<p>Posted by Anonymous at 5:45 PM on January 26 </p>
<p>I too read Auster&rsquo;s take on it, and he&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s no question about the Left living on lies. </p>
<p>In fact, I think we can add to the many examples of polarity, Man/Woman, Night/Day, etc. Reality and Anti-Reality.  There are those who go in search for the truth, making peace along the way with the fact that ultimate truth is beyond our grasp, but that our reach should exceed it anyway.<br>
And then there are those who think they already have it and are eager to impose it on the rest of us.  Probably all of us have spent some time in either group, or fall somewhere in between.  But you get the idea.</p>
<p>The first group lives in Reality, imperfectly, and likes it, because they believe in spiritual growth.  <br>
The second one doesn&rsquo;t live in Reality because they hate it.  It&rsquo;s as if they have an alergy to it the way alcoholics have an alergy to alcohol.  In fact, their hatred of Reality takes on a certain perverse pleasure. And it is this hatred of Reality that gobbles up their reason and conscience, the absence of which they attemp to conceal, unsuccessfully, in sanctimoniousness. Which they confuse with sincerity.  <br>
The only thing sincere about these people is their denial; and &#8220;sincere denial&#8221; is the defintion of - Delusional.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the more the events of late, the more the pressures of Cultural History, are felt by us all, the more cracks in the pot, so to speak.  I think these folks are quite literally coming undone. And I think this article is one of many symptoms, one of the many manifestations, brought on by their current unraveling.  <br>
And I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Mr. Auster. The Left will implode, explode, and be elbowed out of the picture by a rival explanation whose principle feature will be a commitment to Reality. It&rsquo;ll have to be.  Cause, if not&hellip;&hellip;..<br>

			<p>He might be an &#8220;inspiration&#8221; but, in terms of believability and sincerity, I&rsquo;d put him a notch or two below Reverend Ike.  <br>
Remember him?<br>
&#8220;If you want pie in the sky by and by, then you don&rsquo;t want Reverend Ike. But if you want pie ala-mode with ice cream on top, then listen to Reverend Ike every Sunday morning&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>????????  </p>
<p>Not quite sure what he means.  Maybe that statement had somethign to do with his &#8220;Thinkanomics.&#8221;  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Ike" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Ike</a></p>
<p>But one thing I&rsquo;ll say about Ike, he was no phoney; whereas he seemed pretty committed to spreading the word of God, he in no way was interested in sharing his wealth.  He was in to flaunting it. <br>
BO is also not into sharing his wealth, he wants to share yours.  And not only does he not want to flaunt what he has, he wants us to magically believe he doesn&rsquo;t have anything (too late BO. Your campaign and inauguration both made it clear that you are rolling in it.  It might not be your money, but&hellip;)<br>
 <br>
Never the less, both BO (as I like to call him) and Ike wanted to be rich and powerful.<br>
Yet, Ike saw his concern for others as a means to that end, and flaunted it. <br>
BO conceals the same desire to be rich and powerful in abstractions like &#8220;Hope&#8221; and &#8220;Change&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ike is the honest one.</p>

			<p>There is only one explanation that makes any sense. The 20 question test was dumbed down to the point where most folks can answer all of the questions correctly. So the test does not measure knowledge or intelligence. All it measures is the minimal effort necessary to sit and complete the test. One could easily believe that many blacks will invest this effort post Obama where they may not have pre Obama. However, the knowledge and intelligence gap remains.</p>

			<p>Two points:</p>
<p>1) If this so called &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; is true then would it not point to an incredible malleability on the part of black youth that should be seen as potentially dangerous? Meaning any charismatic leader can form them into whatever they want  &mdash;  good or bad.</p>
<p>2) Since the election of Mr. Obama I&rsquo;ve felt like someone kicked me in the stomach. However, the situation brings forth a new resolve in me to change the circumstance and make certain it does not repeat.</p>
<p>Could it be that when whites face adversity it brings out the fight in them but for blacks the opposite is true? Could that not be another possible conclusion of this &#8220;study&#8221;? That black youth can only succeed when said adversity is all but removed?</p>

			<p>The LAST paragraph in this article&hellip; says it all! The Black dressed in ratty clothes, urinating on the sidewalk&hellip; is the REAL picture of average Black mentality. But liberals insist on viewing Blacks thru rose-colored glasses and turn a blind eye to their many flaws.</p>
<p>Remember those infamous &#8220;Jenna 6&#8221; Blacks charged with attempting to murder a White student? Have any of them raised themselves above their background after all the help and publicity? Far from it, unfortunately, as news items have shown. So why could we even try to believe Obama&rsquo;s presidency will encourage the average Black to eschew criminal companions, dilligently apply himself in school and get a job rather than shooting drugs and burning his brains out with cheap booze? What&rsquo;s that expression again&hellip; ? &#8220;GET REAL, MAN!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Years of neo-Marxist brainwashing have led to the complete dumbing down of Western Civilisation with truth now lies and lies the new truth. We now, thanks to our neo-Marxist ruling elite, live in the new Dark Ages where Blacks built the Pyramids using black-invented spaceships and Africa was a mighty civilisation that those jealous whites couldn&rsquo;t wait to destroy when they first gazed upon its awesome wonder in sheer amazement. Now we find blacks have even more miraculous powers that have suddenly sprung to life upon the election of Obama the Lord. Barely a week in office and the Black Messiah is using his stupendous talents to overnight convert failures into wondrous successes. Oh ye of little faith, why didst thou doubt him? How lucky are those of us who managed to touch the hem of his garment as he walked amongst us at his anointment/inauguration. I was blind but now I see, O Great One. The claims for his wondrous achievements will be many and will surely be related in the Messiah&rsquo;s New Bible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a mighty long four years for you American folks.<br>

			<p>Right, now that as black man is president, there will not be a large number of out-of-wedlock birth rates in the black community, the gang violence will disappear, big businesses/structured governments will form in black communities, they will quite blaming the white man and all the of black on white violence will cease.  All the problems of the black community will now disappear that a black man is in charge.  I mean, look at Africa&hellip;right?</p>

			<p>I would guess that many blacks have made a 100% improvement in one area, current events. Before the election many blacks didn&rsquo;t know who was president of the United States and now the do. They can probably even tell you his country or at least continent of origin. Many even know what type of car the president rides in. Some blacks even know the age of the president. These are all questions that they couldn&rsquo;t answer a year ago and now they can so they must be getting smarter. </p>
<p>Anyone that tries to predict anything based on a 20 question test is an idiot.</p>

			<p>If nothing else&hellip; liberals seem to have learned one lesson from WW II. Specifically Goebbels&rsquo; famous quote: &#8220;A LIE REPEATED OFTEN ENOUGH BECOMES THE TRUTH!&#8221; Aptly demonstrated by the constant hystrical lies about multi-cultural diversity being good; about Blacks being forced into under-achiever status by &#8220;racist Whites.&#8221; Now if ONLY liberals can explain away the inarguable fact Africans back on the home continent, as well as those who stole into Europe via its &#8216;back door&rsquo;, showing the same criminal and dysfunctional character traits.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a predictable &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; that the media is engaging in right now.<br>
Back in 1993 the Illinois supreme court ordered Michelle Obama to cease practicing law due to some serious transgression that is obviously being withheld by the media.<br>
Just imagine how fervently the media would have disseminated this news to all of us if that happened to Sarah Palin(or even a white democrat).<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant that Michelle Obama was &#8220;not running for office&#8221;.<br>
My point was that the media in general censors stories that are considered to be damaging to a black candidate which would have been the case if &#8220;CNNABCNBCMSNBCFOX&#8221; did a story on Michelle&rsquo;s little transgression that resulted in her not being able to practice law in IL.<br>
in fact,since the details of the incident have been buried, how can you say that it didn&rsquo;t involve Obama(her attorney husband)?.<br>
Do you really believe that we would not have been informed by the mainstream news if Bush&rsquo;s wife were an attorney and had been forbidden to practice it?</p>

			<p>If I took a test these days, I would grossly underperform myself because of the pessimism that Obama&rsquo;s election has &#8220;inspired&#8221; me with.</p>
<p>Which brings up the &#8220;nature or nurture&#8221; problem.</p>
<p>Here is how you can make a population of avg. IQ, say, 85 be about as accomplished as a population of avg. IQ, say, 100.</p>
<p>You provide all the &#8220;nurturing&#8221; to the former while <b>suppressing</b> the development of the latter. As a result most of the members of the first group perform at the maximum of their biological and genetic abilities, while most of the members of the second group act as if their IQ were a standard deviation less than it actually is.</p>
<p>And when you look at these tens of millions of white, educated voters that voted for Obama, you can see that this artificial lowering of group&rsquo;s IQ actually is the case.</p>
<p>For if you have a hen to win with an eagle in a flying competition, it&rsquo;s not enough to &#8220;nurture&#8221; the hen so that it will fly as fast as it can.  You must also cut eagle&rsquo;s wings so that it cannot fly well.<br>

<p>I think you know well what point Dave is making.</p>
<p>Like it or not, many of us are curious about the skeletons in the closet of the Black First Lady.</p>
<p>We also know that Black misbehavior is covered up and excused by the mainstream media at almost every occation while White misbehavior is delved into and vilified at almost every occation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious to know what is so damning about Martin Luther King&rsquo;s record that it must be covered up to this day and beyond.</p>
<p>The suppression of such information benefits those who want to make big time sinners appear to be saints.</p>
<p>First Lady is not as prestigous as a true political office but it is very high profile.  Why would anyone want the information suppressed unless they percieve themselves or someone they like benefitting from having it suppressed?</p>

<p>Thanks for the link.  The media hold up Madame Obama as a paragon of a &#8216;highly educated, ivy-league&rsquo; educated intelligent black female role model.  In reality, if it were not for AA, she would never have been accepted at Princeton and/or Harvard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the MSM is sitting on this story and wouldn&rsquo;t have hesitated to release it against ANY given White candidate.  Just one more way obmama received a pass before the election (although I think his days are numbered and the MSM will soon turn on him).</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I wonder how many of the mindless mouth pieces giving their commentary about the &#8216;wonderful, smart First Lady,&rsquo; know that in 1993, Michelle Obama, was ordered by the Illinois Supreme Court to stop practicing law? The faux First Lady was ordered by the court; it was not her choice. (Click here). The records are sealed by the court so we don&rsquo;t know why, but I am told by lawyers sending me email, it had to be something major for such drastic action&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd430.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd430.htm</a></p>
<p>For more information about how a clearly unqualified Michelle Obmama was accepted by Princeton and Harvard:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; but she was not at the top of her (high school) class. She didn&rsquo;t get the attention of the school&rsquo;s college counselors, who helped the brightest students find spots at prestigious universities. &hellip; Some of her teachers told her she didn&rsquo;t have the grades or test scores to make it to the Ivies. But she applied to Princeton and was accepted&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;At Harvard&hellip;&rsquo;She recognized that she had been privileged by affirmative action and she was very comfortable with that,&rsquo; [friend Verna] Williams recalls&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/sailer/080225_michelle_obama.htm</p>
<p>Would ANY White or Asian student be accepted to an Ivy-League College if he were not at the very top of his class?  </p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s salutatorian at my middle daughter&rsquo;s high school, an Asian with perfect SAT scores, was rejected by Princeton, Yale and Harvard (he &#8216;settled&rsquo; on Berkeley).</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for people, especially the younger among us, having an idol, a role model, a mentor, someone to look up to. The problem is, that in this society, there is too much poising, and false pride, with nothing to back it up. One needs to be able to point to something they&rsquo;ve actually accomplished. It&rsquo;s one thing to believe you are now a new and improved man/women, because of the influence of some outside agent, but the danger is that unless one can demonstrate &#8220;real&#8221; accomplishment, it&rsquo;s all self deception. The self-esteem movement, has created so many people whos feelings of superiority rest on a foundation of sand. When the real tests in life come, the illusions drop away and only dissapointment is left.</p>

<p>Which is the PERFECT REASON to reject any Black role model. Given that we all know how much (rather how little) Blacks contributed to our civilization before 1865. As well as how much they&rsquo;ve swelled welfare rolls since 1965! Not to mention how they&rsquo;ve collectively managed to inflate crime stats, not just in America, but world-wide!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this.  I do remember in the early 1970&rsquo;s when affirmative action blacks, almost all women were being made school superintendents of large cities with disfunctional black schools.  Every one of these affirmative action supervisors was greeted with Hosannas to the Highest!!  The very though of these superintendents would magically raise black test scores.  </p>
<p>I particularly remember an affirmative action black woman named Ruth Love who was appointed superintendent of the City of Chicago public schools in the 1970&rsquo;s.  The very thought of her in charge of the school system would raise the average black IQ from 85 (retarded) 20 points to 105 (normal).  Their behavior would change to normalcy.  Test scores would rise and rise, simply because a &#8220;strong&#8221; black role model was in charge.</p>
<p>Never, never happened.  As whites fled from thuggish predatory black behavior, test scores fell and violence rose during Ruth Love&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>Just another crock from the anti white pro marxist media.</p>

Complete with outlandish clothes making them them look like circus freaks&hellip; then chanting the lessons at the class. Hey, it might even start a new trend! Besides appealing to the illegal immigrant community as well.</p>
