			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hua Hsu, Atlantic, January/February 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Civilization&rsquo;s going to pieces,&#8221; he remarks. He is in polite company, gathered with friends around a bottle of wine in the late-afternoon sun, chatting and gossiping. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Colored Empires by this man Goddard?&#8221; They hadn&rsquo;t. &#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don&rsquo;t look out the white race will be &mdash; will be utterly submerged. It&rsquo;s all scientific stuff; it&rsquo;s been proved.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is Tom Buchanan, a character in F. Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s The Great Gatsby, a book that nearly everyone who passes through the American education system is compelled to read at least once. Although Gatsby doesn&rsquo;t gloss as a book on racial anxiety &mdash; it&rsquo;s too busy exploring a different set of anxieties entirely &mdash; Buchanan was hardly alone in feeling besieged. The book by &#8220;this man Goddard&#8221; had a real-world analogue: Lothrop Stoddard&rsquo;s The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy, published in 1920, five years before Gatsby. Nine decades later, Stoddard&rsquo;s polemic remains oddly engrossing. He refers to World War I as the &#8220;White Civil War&#8221; and laments the &#8220;cycle of ruin&#8221; that may result if the &#8220;white world&#8221; continues its infighting. The book features a series of foldout maps depicting the distribution of &#8220;color&#8221; throughout the world and warns, &#8220;Colored migration is a universal peril, menacing every part of the white world.&#8221;</p>
<p>As briefs for racial supremacy go, The Rising Tide of Color is eerily serene. Its tone is scholarly and gentlemanly, its hatred rationalized and, in Buchanan&rsquo;s term, &#8220;scientific.&#8221; And the book was hardly a fringe phenomenon. It was published by Scribner, also Fitzgerald&rsquo;s publisher, and Stoddard, who received a doctorate in history from Harvard, was a member of many professional academic associations. It was precisely the kind of book that a 1920s man of Buchanan&rsquo;s profile &mdash; wealthy, Ivy League &mdash; educated, at once pretentious and intellectually insecure &mdash; might have been expected to bring up in casual conversation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether you describe it as the dawning of a post-racial age or just the end of white America, we&rsquo;re approaching a profound demographic tipping point. According to an August 2008 report by the U.S. Census Bureau, those groups currently categorized as racial minorities &mdash; blacks and Hispanics, East Asians and South Asians &mdash; will account for a majority of the U.S. population by the year 2042. Among Americans under the age of 18, this shift is projected to take place in 2023, which means that every child born in the United States from here on out will belong to the first post-white generation.</p>
<p>Obviously, steadily ascending rates of interracial marriage complicate this picture, pointing toward what Michael Lind has described as the &#8220;beiging&#8221; of America. And it&rsquo;s possible that &#8220;beige Americans&#8221; will self-identify as &#8220;white&#8221; in sufficient numbers to push the tipping point further into the future than the Census Bureau projects. But even if they do, whiteness will be a label adopted out of convenience and even indifference, rather than aspiration and necessity. For an earlier generation of minorities and immigrants, to be recognized as a &#8220;white American,&#8221; whether you were an Italian or a Pole or a Hungarian, was to enter the mainstream of American life; to be recognized as something else, as the Thind case [United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, in which an Indian American veteran of World War I sought to become a naturalized citizen by proving that he was Caucasian] suggests, was to be permanently excluded. As Bill Imada, head of the IW Group, a prominent Asian American communications and marketing company, puts it: &#8220;I think in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, [for] anyone who immigrated, the aspiration was to blend in and be as American as possible so that white America wouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated by them. They wanted to imitate white America as much as possible: learn English, go to church, go to the same schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, the picture is far more complex. To take the most obvious example, whiteness is no longer a precondition for entry into the highest levels of public office. The son of Indian immigrants doesn&rsquo;t have to become &#8220;white&#8221; in order to be elected governor of Louisiana. A half-Kenyan, half-Kansan politician can self-identify as black and be elected president of the United States.</p>
<p>As a purely demographic matter, then, the &#8220;white America&#8221; that Lothrop Stoddard believed in so fervently may cease to exist in 2040, 2050, or 2060, or later still. But where the culture is concerned, it&rsquo;s already all but finished. Instead of the long-standing model of assimilation toward a common center, the culture is being remade in the image of white America&rsquo;s multiethnic, multicolored heirs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not everyone was so enthused. Clinton&rsquo;s remarks caught the attention of another anxious Buchanan &mdash; Pat Buchanan, the conservative thinker. {snip}</p>
<p>Today, the arrival of what Buchanan derided as &#8220;Third World America&#8221; is all but inevitable. What will the new mainstream of America look like, and what ideas or values might it rally around? What will it mean to be white after &#8220;whiteness&#8221; no longer defines the mainstream? Will anyone mourn the end of white America? Will anyone try to preserve it?</p>
<p>Another moment from The Great Gatsby: as Fitzgerald&rsquo;s narrator and Gatsby drive across the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, a car passes them, and Nick Carraway notices that it is a limousine &#8220;driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>For a contemporary embodiment of the upheaval that this scene portended, consider Sean Combs, a hip-hop mogul and one of the most famous African Americans on the planet. Combs grew up during hip-hop&rsquo;s late-1970s rise, and he belongs to the first generation that could safely make a living working in the industry &mdash; as a plucky young promoter and record-label intern in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as a fashion designer, artist, and music executive worth hundreds of millions of dollars a brief decade later.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Combs made a fascinating gesture toward New York&rsquo;s high society. He announced his arrival into the circles of the rich and powerful not by crashing their parties, but by inviting them into his own spectacularly over-the-top world. Combs began to stage elaborate annual parties in the Hamptons, not far from where Fitzgerald&rsquo;s novel takes place. These &#8220;white parties&#8221; &mdash; attendees are required to wear white &mdash; quickly became legendary for their opulence (in 2004, Combs showcased a 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence) as well as for the cultures-colliding quality of Hamptons elites paying their respects to someone so comfortably nouveau riche. Prospective business partners angled to get close to him and praised him as a guru of the lucrative &#8220;urban&#8221; market, while grateful partygoers hailed him as a modern-day Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I read The Great Gatsby?&#8221; Combs said to a London newspaper in 2001. &#8220;I am the Great Gatsby.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In this regard, Combs is both a product and a hero of the new cultural mainstream, which prizes diversity above all else, and whose ultimate goal is some vague notion of racial transcendence, rather than subversion or assimilation. Although Combs&rsquo;s vision is far from representative &mdash; not many hip-hop stars vacation in St. Tropez with a parasol-toting manservant shading their every step &mdash; his industry lies at the heart of this new mainstream. Over the past 30 years, few changes in American culture have been as significant as the rise of hip-hop. The genre has radically reshaped the way we listen to and consume music, first by opposing the pop mainstream and then by becoming it. From its constant sampling of past styles and eras &mdash; old records, fashions, slang, anything &mdash; to its mythologization of the self-made black antihero, hip-hop is more than a musical genre: it&rsquo;s a philosophy, a political statement, a way of approaching and remaking culture. It&rsquo;s a lingua franca not just among kids in America, but also among young people worldwide. And its economic impact extends beyond the music industry, to fashion, advertising, and film. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, hip-hop&rsquo;s colonization of the global imagination, from fashion runways in Europe to dance competitions in Asia, is Disney-esque. This transformation has bred an unprecedented cultural confidence in its black originators. Whiteness is no longer a threat, or an ideal: it&rsquo;s kitsch to be appropriated, whether with gestures like Combs&rsquo;s &#8220;white parties&#8221; or the trickle-down epidemic of collared shirts and cuff links currently afflicting rappers. And an expansive multiculturalism is replacing the us-against-the-world bunker mentality that lent a thrilling edge to hip-hop&rsquo;s mid-1990s rise.</p>
<p>Peter Rosenberg, a self-proclaimed &#8220;nerdy Jewish kid&#8221; and radio personality on New York&rsquo;s Hot 97 FM &mdash; and a living example of how hip-hop has created new identities for its listeners that don&rsquo;t fall neatly along lines of black and white &mdash; shares another example: &#8220;I interviewed [the St. Louis rapper] Nelly this morning, and he said it&rsquo;s now very cool and in to have multicultural friends. Like you&rsquo;re not really considered hip or &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve made it&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re rolling with all the same people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as Tiger Woods forever changed the country-club culture of golf, and Will Smith confounded stereotypes about the ideal Hollywood leading man, hip-hop&rsquo;s rise is helping redefine the American mainstream, which no longer aspires toward a single iconic image of style or class. Successful network-television shows like Lost, Heroes, and Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy feature wildly diverse casts, and an entire genre of half-hour comedy, from The Colbert Report to The Office, seems dedicated to having fun with the persona of the clueless white male. The youth market is following the same pattern: consider the Cheetah Girls, a multicultural, multiplatinum, multiplatform trio of teenyboppers who recently starred in their third movie, or Dora the Explorer, the precocious bilingual 7-year-old Latina adventurer who is arguably the most successful animated character on children&rsquo;s television today. In a recent address to the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies, Brown Johnson, the Nickelodeon executive who has overseen Dora&rsquo;s rise, explained the importance of creating a character who does not conform to &#8220;the white, middle-class mold.&#8221; When Johnson pointed out that Dora&rsquo;s wares were outselling Barbie&rsquo;s in France, the crowd hooted in delight.</p>
<p>Pop culture today rallies around an ethic of multicultural inclusion that seems to value every identity &mdash; except whiteness. &#8220;It&rsquo;s become harder for the blond-haired, blue-eyed commercial actor,&#8221; remarks Rochelle Newman-Carrasco, of the Hispanic marketing firm Enlace. &#8220;You read casting notices, and they like to cast people with brown hair because they could be Hispanic. The language of casting notices is pretty shocking because it&rsquo;s so specific: &lsquo;Brown hair, brown eyes, could look Hispanic.&rsquo; Or, as one notice put it: &lsquo;Ethnically ambiguous.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think white people feel like they&rsquo;re under siege right now &mdash; like it&rsquo;s not okay to be white right now, especially if you&rsquo;re a white male,&#8221; laughs Bill Imada, of the IW Group. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I always tell the white men in the room, &lsquo;We need you,&rsquo;&#8221; Imada says. &#8220;We cannot talk about diversity and inclusion and engagement without you at the table. It&rsquo;s okay to be white!</p>
<p>&#8220;But people are stressed out about it. &lsquo;We used to be in control! We&rsquo;re losing control!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re right &mdash; if white America is indeed &#8220;losing control,&#8221; and if the future will belong to people who can successfully navigate a post-racial, multicultural landscape &mdash; then it&rsquo;s no surprise that many white Americans are eager to divest themselves of their whiteness entirely.</p>
<p>For some, this renunciation can take a radical form. In 1994, a young graffiti artist and activist named William &#8220;Upski&#8221; Wimsatt, the son of a university professor, published Bomb the Suburbs, the spiritual heir to Norman Mailer&rsquo;s celebratory 1957 essay, &#8220;The White Negro.&#8221; Wimsatt was deeply committed to hip-hop&rsquo;s transformative powers, going so far as to embrace the status of the lowly &#8220;wigger,&#8221; a pejorative term popularized in the early 1990s to describe white kids who steep themselves in black culture. Wimsatt viewed the wigger&rsquo;s immersion in two cultures as an engine for change. &#8220;If channeled in the right way,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;the wigger can go a long way toward repairing the sickness of race in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wimsatt&rsquo;s painfully earnest attempts to put his own relationship with whiteness under the microscope coincided with the emergence of an academic discipline known as &#8220;whiteness studies.&#8221; In colleges and universities across the country, scholars began examining the history of &#8220;whiteness&#8221; and unpacking its contradictions. Why, for example, had the Irish and the Italians fallen beyond the pale at different moments in our history? Were Jewish Americans white? And, as the historian Matthew Frye Jacobson asked, &#8220;Why is it that in the United States, a white woman can have black children but a black woman cannot have white children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Much like Wimsatt, the whiteness-studies academics &mdash; figures such as Jacobson, David Roediger, Eric Lott, and Noel Ignatiev &mdash; were attempting to come to terms with their own relationships with whiteness, in its past and present forms. In the early 1990s, Ignatiev, a former labor activist and the author of How the Irish Became White, set out to &#8220;abolish&#8221; the idea of the white race by starting the New Abolitionist Movement and founding a journal titled Race Traitor. &#8220;There is nothing positive about white identity,&#8221; he wrote in 1998. &#8220;As James Baldwin said, &lsquo;As long as you think you&rsquo;re white, there&rsquo;s no hope for you.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I get it: as a straight white male, I&rsquo;m the worst thing on Earth,&#8221; Christian Lander says. Lander is a Canadian-born, Los Angeles &mdash; based satirist who in January 2008 started a blog called Stuff White People Like (stuffwhitepeoplelike.com), which pokes fun at the manners and mores of a specific species of young, hip, upwardly mobile whites. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Like, I&rsquo;m aware of all the horrible crimes that my demographic has done in the world,&#8221; Lander says. &#8220;And there&rsquo;s a bunch of white people who are desperate &mdash; desperate &mdash; to say, &lsquo;You know what? My skin&rsquo;s white, but I&rsquo;m not one of the white people who&rsquo;s destroying the world.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Matt Wray, a sociologist at Temple University who is a fan of Lander&rsquo;s humor, has observed that many of his white students are plagued by a racial-identity crisis: &#8220;They don&rsquo;t care about socioeconomics; they care about culture. And to be white is to be culturally broke. The classic thing white students say when you ask them to talk about who they are is, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have a culture.&rsquo; They might be privileged, they might be loaded socioeconomically, but they feel bankrupt when it comes to culture&hellip;&nbsp;. They feel disadvantaged, and they feel marginalized. They don&rsquo;t have a culture that&rsquo;s cool or oppositional.&#8221; Wray says that this feeling of being culturally bereft often prevents students from recognizing what it means to be a child of privilege &mdash; a strange irony that the first wave of whiteness-studies scholars, in the 1990s, failed to anticipate.</p>
<p>Of course, the obvious material advantages that come with being born white &mdash; lower infant-mortality rates and easier-to-acquire bank loans, for example &mdash; tend to undercut any sympathy that this sense of marginalization might generate. And in the right context, cultural-identity crises can turn well-meaning whites into instant punch lines. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The best defense is to be constantly pulling the rug out from underneath yourself,&#8221; Wray remarks, describing the way self-aware whites contend with their complicated identity. &#8220;Beat people to the punch. You&rsquo;re forced as a white person into a sense of ironic detachment. Irony is what fuels a lot of white subcultures. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;flight from whiteness&#8221; of urban, college-educated, liberal whites isn&rsquo;t the only attempt to answer this question. You can flee into whiteness as well. This can mean pursuing the authenticity of an imagined past: think of the deliberately white-bread world of Mormon America, where the &rsquo;50s never ended, or the anachronistic WASP entitlement flaunted in books like last year&rsquo;s A Privileged Life: Celebrating WASP Style, a handsome coffee-table book compiled by Susanna Salk, depicting a world of seersucker blazers, whale pants, and deck shoes. {snip} But these enclaves of preserved-in-amber whiteness are likely to be less important to the American future than the construction of whiteness as a somewhat pissed-off minority culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As with the unexpected success of the apocalyptic Left Behind novels, or the Jeff Foxworthy &mdash; organized Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the rise of country music and auto racing took place well off the American elite&rsquo;s radar screen. (None of Christian Lander&rsquo;s white people would be caught dead at a NASCAR race.) These phenomena reflected a growing sense of cultural solidarity among lower-middle-class whites &mdash; a solidarity defined by a yearning for American &#8220;authenticity,&#8221; a folksy realness that rejects the global, the urban, and the effete in favor of nostalgia for &#8220;the way things used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other forms of identity politics, white solidarity comes complete with its own folk heroes, conspiracy theories (Barack Obama is a secret Muslim! The U.S. is going to merge with Canada and Mexico!), and laundry lists of injustices. The targets and scapegoats vary &mdash; from multiculturalism and affirmative action to a loss of moral values, from immigration to an economy that no longer guarantees the American worker a fair chance &mdash; and so do the political programs they inspire. (Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan both tapped into this white identity politics in the 1990s; today, its tribunes run the ideological gamut, from Jim Webb to Ron Paul to Mike Huckabee to Sarah Palin.) But the core grievance, in each case, has to do with cultural and socioeconomic dislocation &mdash; the sense that the system that used to guarantee the white working class some stability has gone off-kilter.</p>
<p>Wray is one of the founders of what has been called &#8220;white-trash studies,&#8221; a field conceived as a response to the perceived elite-liberal marginalization of the white working class. He argues that the economic downturn of the 1970s was the precondition for the formation of an &#8220;oppositional&#8221; and &#8220;defiant&#8221; white-working-class sensibility &mdash; think of the rugged, anti-everything individualism of 1977&rsquo;s Smokey and the Bandit. {snip}</p>
<p>The result is a racial pride that dares not speak its name, and that defines itself through cultural cues instead &mdash; a suspicion of intellectual elites and city dwellers, a preference for folksiness and plainness of speech (whether real or feigned), and the association of a working-class white minority with &#8220;the real America.&#8221; (In the Scots-Irish belt that runs from Arkansas up through West Virginia, the most common ethnic label offered to census takers is &#8220;American.&#8221;) Arguably, this white identity politics helped swing the 2000 and 2004 elections, serving as the powerful counterpunch to urban white liberals, and the McCain-Palin campaign relied on it almost to the point of absurdity (as when a McCain surrogate dismissed Northern Virginia as somehow not part of &#8220;the real Virginia&#8221;) as a bulwark against the threatening multiculturalism of Barack Obama. Their strategy failed, of course, but it&rsquo;s possible to imagine white identity politics growing more potent and more forthright in its racial identifications in the future, as &#8220;the real America&#8221; becomes an ever-smaller portion of, well, the real America, and as the soon-to-be white minority&rsquo;s sense of being besieged and disdained by a multicultural majority grows apace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The coming white minority does not mean that the racial hierarchy of American culture will suddenly become inverted, as in 1995&rsquo;s White Man&rsquo;s Burden, an awful thought experiment of a film, starring John Travolta, that envisions an upside-down world in which whites are subjugated to their high-class black oppressors. There will be dislocations and resentments along the way, but the demographic shifts of the next 40 years are likely to reduce the power of racial hierarchies over everyone&rsquo;s lives, producing a culture that&rsquo;s more likely than any before to treat its inhabitants as individuals, rather than members of a caste or identity group.</p>
<p>Consider the world of advertising and marketing, industries that set out to mold our desires at a subconscious level. {snip} Instead of herding consumers toward a discrete center, the goal today is to create versatile images and campaigns that can be adapted to highly individualized tastes. (Think of the dancing silhouettes in Apple&rsquo;s iPod campaign, which emphasizes individuality and diversity without privileging &mdash; or even representing &mdash; any specific group.)</p>
<p>At the moment, we can call this the triumph of multiculturalism, or post-racialism. But just as whiteness has no inherent meaning &mdash; it is a vessel we fill with our hopes and anxieties &mdash; these terms may prove equally empty in the long run. Does being post-racial mean that we are past race completely, or merely that race is no longer essential to how we identify ourselves? {snip}</p>
<p>The logic of online social networking points in a similar direction. The New York University sociologist Dalton Conley has written of a &#8220;network nation,&#8221; in which applications like Facebook and MySpace create &#8220;crosscutting social groups&#8221; and new, flexible identities that only vaguely overlap with racial identities. Perhaps this is where the future of identity after whiteness lies &mdash; in a dramatic departure from the racial logic that has defined American culture from the very beginning. What Conley, Carter, and others are describing isn&rsquo;t merely the displacement of whiteness from our cultural center; they&rsquo;re describing a social structure that treats race as just one of a seemingly infinite number of possible self-identifications.</p>
<p>The problem of the 20th century, W. E. B. DuBois famously predicted, would be the problem of the color line. Will this continue to be the case in the 21st century, when a black president will govern a country whose social networks increasingly cut across every conceivable line of identification? {snip}</p>
<p>But maybe this is merely how it used to be &mdash; maybe this is already an outdated way of looking at things. {snip}</p>

<p>I wonder why he hasn&rsquo;t taken into consideration the liklihood of a global crash which could send many third worlders in the West back home or driven our of Western countries altogether.<br>

		<p>Unfortunately, I see a lot of truth in this essay.</p>
<p>However, I remain optimistic for the white race   &mdash;   in the long run.</p>
<p>Currently, the influence of the white race is certainly in a decline.  Europeans hit their modern high-water mark in the 19th Century.  Things are going downhill, and will get worse before they get better.  I&rsquo;m 51.  I won&rsquo;t live to see the bottom.  Maybe my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren will.  Maybe not.</p>
<p>But, no matter how long it takes, there WILL be a white renaissance!  Whites combine the agression/ambition of blacks with the intelligence/self-control of orientals in an ideal ratio.  Without a significant and thriving white population, blacks won&rsquo;t have anyone to sponge off, and orientals won&rsquo;t have anyone to copy.  Without the vigor and intelligence of the white race, civilization will decay and   &mdash;   hopefully - some future generation of whites will finally shed its self-loathing and understand the importance of protecting its uniqueness.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Maybe this is already an outdated way of looking at things&hellip;&#8221;<br>
I tell people when ever I hear them describe someone as &#8220;a racist living in the past&#8221; that they should say &#8220;he`s looking toward the future.&#8221; Then after the harsh looks come and go, I quote population figures that have us going from 30% of the world population down to 8% in our living memory. Sometimes it gets them thinking. Or how about asking someone what our numbers are worldwide. Usually the guess is around 25%. When I tell them 8% and falling some have a look of disbelief and a small few a look of dismay. </p>

		<p><b>Pop culture today rallies around an ethic of multicultural inclusion that seems to value every identity &mdash; except whiteness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s become harder for the blond-haired, blue-eyed commercial actor,&rdquo; remarks Rochelle Newman-Carrasco, of the Hispanic marketing firm Enlace. &ldquo;You read casting notices, and they like to cast people with brown hair because they could be Hispanic. The language of casting notices is pretty shocking because it&rsquo;s so specific: &lsquo;Brown hair, brown eyes, could look Hispanic.&rsquo; Or, as one notice put it: &lsquo;Ethnically ambiguous.&rsquo;&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Of course! It&rsquo;s not like a &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; (read: Mestizo) would be biased towards &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, would it? Excuse me while I ask one of Britain&rsquo;s top imams on whether he thinks British society should be &#8220;healthily Islamic&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>The classic thing white students say when you ask them to talk about who they are is, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have a culture.&rsquo; They might be privileged, they might be loaded socioeconomically, but they feel bankrupt when it comes to culture&hellip; . They feel disadvantaged, and they feel marginalized. They don&rsquo;t have a culture that&rsquo;s cool or oppositional.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Well, that is what happens when you insist that an exclusively-white &#8220;American&#8221; identity is &#8216;racist&rsquo;/&rsquo;must be diversified&rsquo; et al.</p>
<p><b>Of course, the obvious material advantages that come with being born white &mdash; lower infant-mortality rates and easier-to-acquire bank loans, for example &mdash; tend to undercut any sympathy that this sense of marginalization might generate.</b></p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t it funny that when the blacks and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; got &#8216;easy loans&rsquo;, America suddenly found itself in the Sub-Prime Crisis - oh wait, that&rsquo;s right &#8220;Racist White Bankers Give Poor &#8216;Minority&rsquo; Families Loans They Can&rsquo;t Pay Back&hellip;To&hellip;Make&hellip;A&hellip;Profit?&#8221;.<br>
And I want to know what he&rsquo;s getting at with &#8220;lower infant mortality rates&#8221; - is it that there are more viable white births, or that white Americans are less likely to kill their offspring?</p>
<p><b>If they&rsquo;re right &mdash; if white America is indeed &ldquo;losing control,&rdquo; and if the future will belong to people who can successfully navigate a post-racial, multicultural landscape &mdash; then it&rsquo;s no surprise that many white Americans are eager to divest themselves of their whiteness entirely.</b></p>
<p>Translation: <i>White Americans are doomed to become alienated and marginalised unless they either 1. Manage to eke out some form of racial conciousness, or 2. Mate with a non-white, and hope their offspring can &#8220;pass&#8221; in that respective society</i></p>
<p>Yet another non-white gleefully rubbing his hands at the demise of a white America. Nothing new here, folks</p>

		<p>I have sympathy for the &#8220;lower&#8221; class Whites who rallied to the &#8220;Left Behind&#8221; series. However, I think that mind-set is part of the problem. See the article by Alain Du Benoist in this winter&rsquo;s Occidental Quarterly about the relationship between Christianity and culture-destroying liberalism (can be read online).</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is happening because it had to happen.</p>
<p>Whites are diminishing.</p>
<p>Much like the Druids, who simply vanished when the Christians took over. </p>
<p>The Druids could pretend to be Christians, in order to escape persecution. But Whites cannot pretend to be another race.</p>
<p>There will be a remnant, a core, who will embody the empathy and faithfulness toward each other that is so sadly lacking today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiteness&#8221; will become their religion, a new paganism.</p>
<p>The Christian god has already been exposed as championing multiculturalism on the sly. Christianity will become more and more &#8220;de-Germanized&#8221; and return to its radical, egalitarian  roots in which &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221;  will be emphasized over family, &#8220;contributing&#8221; over individual achievement, and &#8220;love&#8221; over noble behavior.</p>

		<p>From Article: &#8220;At the moment, we can call this the triumph of multiculturalism, or post-racialism. But just as whiteness has no inherent meaning &mdash; it is a vessel we fill with our hopes and anxieties &mdash; these terms may prove equally empty in the long run. Does being post-racial mean that we are past race completely, or merely that race is no longer essential to how we identify ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be any more wrong! Nearly every institution in the country has one official form or another that that asks you your Race. <br>
You can&rsquo;t have a &#8220;post-racial America&#8221; and Affirmative Action at the same time!!!!!! <br>
All we need is a politician that will regularly walk up to the microphone and and that Affirmative Action must end and all racial preferences must end. Then watch how racial the &#8220;hip-hop culture&#8221; gets. Watch as &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; is &#8220;restored&#8221;.</p>

&#8220;And, as the historian Matthew Frye Jacobson asked, &ldquo;Why is it that in the United States, a white woman can have black children but a black woman cannot have white children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be because the &#8220;Black&#8221; genetic code is dominant over that of the White. (or, as the evolutionists put it, the &#8220;Black&#8221; is the more primitive type).</p>
<p>If that is true, Whites can be bred into the &#8220;Black&#8221;, but it would be impossible to breed the &#8220;Black&#8221; upward into the White.</p>

A few weeks back at work, I took the opportunity to show two white co-workers three articles in the Buffalo News. Two of them didn&rsquo;t identify victims as white and attackers as black although it was clear from the names and neighborhoods mentioned that the criminals where black and the victims white. The third article involved a robbery in which the criminal was identified as white. (The Buffalo News allegedly has a policy of not reporting race unless it&rsquo;s relevant to the crime as in it being a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; based on race. The Buffalo News breaks this rule all the time by identifying white criminals but not blacks).</p>
<p>I tried to used these articles as an opportunity to bring up the issue of whites being disproportionate victims of black violence and gauge their reactions. Neither of them expressed any interest or concern. They both looked at me as if they had no understanding of what I was talking about and no interest in the subject.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I try to bring up these issues with co-workers, friends, and family but few of them are willing to listen or talk about these issues. I don&rsquo;t know if they don&rsquo;t care, don&rsquo;t see the issue, or if they&rsquo;re aware of it but ignore it or are afraid of hearing or discussing the truth or facing their darkest fears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise anymore that these articles gleefully proclaiming the end of whites and a future aracial America are now common place in the mainstream press.</p>
<p>From my own experience, I have found that you can tell a white man that he is being crushed and replaced and give him examples and yet he doesn&rsquo;t react. I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>The only hope I see is &#8216;worse is better&rsquo;. Only, I don&rsquo;t know how worse it needs to get or if it does get worse, will it be so bad that whites can&rsquo;t recover.</p>

So how is that culture &#8220;bankrupt&#8221;.  Even on a superficial level, with culture defined as music etc., there is plenty of &#8220;white culture&#8221; out there. </p>

		<p>China/Japan/Korea/Taiwan/India/Mexico/Saudi Arabia/Kuwait/etc allow virtually no immigration whatsoever - yet only WESTERN nations are to be excoriated for &#8220;racism&#8221; should they dare restrict non compatible immigration.</p>
<p>At this 11th hour, our only hope is that the unfolding US economic collapse completely overturns the existing social/political/economic &#8220;apple cart&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was reported today that 698,000 jobs were lost in December ALONE! This in addition to the 550,000 lost jobs in the month of November. Many erudite economists are projecting US job losses to reach 1 MILLION monthly by summer or fall. In such an environment, it SHOULD be impossible to pass amnesty for illegal aliens - or increase &#8220;temporary non-immigrant&#8221; visas like H1-B or L-1. </p>
<p>H1/L1 &#8220;temporary non-immigrant&#8221; visas allow the holder to bring over their entire &#8220;immediate family&#8221; as dependents. Not counting exemptions, 400,000+ H1/L1 visas are being issued annually.</p>
<p>https://www.infoworld.com/article/07/12/28/52FE-underreported-visas_1.html</p>
<p>This Washington Post story reports Latin American immigration was down 36% in 2007 because of immigration enforcement coupled with the bad economy. It also reports a 60% decline in Asian and African immigration!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/22/AR2008092202563.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/22/AR2008092202563.html</a></p>
<p>Thus, it&rsquo;s not unrealistic to expect immigration to REALLY decline as the US economy crashes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our only hope is destroying the all encompassing usurious grip of the PRIVATELY OWNED &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;. They have been given the power to create money out of thin air. With UNLIMITED resources, they have been able to buy/control &#8220;our&#8221; media/government institutions. </p>

		<p>The future that Hua Hsu envisions is dependent on a number of assumptions, two of which in particular are extremely doubtful.  <br>
     First, he assumes that Blacks are equal to Whites.  Most of these young deracinated Whites, so proud of their multicultural social groups, will soon leave the Blacks behind.  If they are college grads, they will find that Blacks are not as able as Whites and don&rsquo;t move up the socio-economic ladder along with their hip White friends.  The successful 30 year old White knows that he earned his high position, and that his old Black friends have earned their lower places.  Unless, of course, Blacks are simply placed in offices so as to have enough diversity.  In that case, the once hip, now 30 year old White will have Black ineptitude thrown in his face.  Either way, experience will teach what the professors did not.  True, there are many educated White adults who are avowed racial egalitarians, but they are liars, like the Soviet elites who shouted equality and hogged the trough.  They don&rsquo;t live near Blacks, they don&rsquo;t socialize with Blacks, and as more than one article posted on this site has demonstrated, they are not at all comfortable around Blacks.  Racial equality is a myth sustained through social pressure and economic coercion, possible only when Whites are afraid to speak their minds.  <br>
     I should add that the same reasoning applies to Hispanics, to a lesser degree.  Not as bad as Blacks, but not as good as Whites.  And again, all intelligent White adults who have exposure to Mexicans know this, but keep quiet out of fear.<br>
     The second doubtful assumption is that the American economy will continue to support these vast armies of effete White office slaves.  What is now America&rsquo;s mainstream culture is founded on the premise that every decent liberal is entitled to a prolonged adolescence, maybe 15 or 20, or even 25 years, to be followed by no more than 20 to 25 years of real labor, and capped off with another 20 or 30 years of comfortable retirement.   What will these aging children do when they find that privilege and security are out of reach?  That &#8220;benefits administrator&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t look so impressive on a resume any more?  And that they can&rsquo;t afford to buy their way into a &#8220;nice&#8221; neighborhood with &#8220;safe&#8221; schools?  That the Black friends they were once so proud to show off are now starting to look like predators?  When their Chinese friends turn Chinese?  And their Facebook and MySpace comrades are as loyal as an internet bride?  They will flee, surrender, or fight.  <br>
     The runaways will find that there&rsquo;s no place to go.<br>
     The quitters will get a non-White mate, and find themselves unwelcome in either culture.<br>
     The fighters will turn redneck.<br>
     The White NASCAR-ice hockey-gun-country music-rural culture is not everything that an intelligent White could ask for, but it&rsquo;s ours.  No apologies are required, no guilt, no watching everything you say so as not to offend the offenders.  It is, in fact, our own counterculture.  It&rsquo;s not especially hospitable to Bach or Mozart, but the typical audience at a classical music concert turns my stomach too.  And working class Whites are generally willing to overlook a taste for string quartets and English literature if you can fix motorcycles or build houses.  Even if you&rsquo;re nothing but a former benefits administrator, if you will only shut up, pay attention, show some respect, and learn to do something useful, you can find a place in this remaining corner of White civilization.  <br>
     So, where will the hip, urban White turn when the economy runs out of money?  No matter how transformative hip hop is, it won&rsquo;t make the Blacks or the cholos accept him.  The Orientals, especially the more recently arrived, will stick to their own tribe, as they have always done.  The online community is no substitute for the presence of real friends who can help you out, as we AmRen posters know.  The &#8220;rednecks&#8221; and their culture are the best refuge for these overaged, lost, children.  We&rsquo;ll need to be ready to receive them.  <br>

		<p>There are parts of this article that are quite insightful.  We all know how to recognize young white multiculturalists.  But it&rsquo;s difficult to zap the origins of the personality.   So this is invaluable (what was snipped out):</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it: as a straight white male, I&rsquo;m the worst thing on Earth,&rdquo; Christian Lander says. Lander is a Canadian-born, Los Angeles–based satirist who in January 2008 started a blog called Stuff White People Like (stuffwhitepeoplelike.com), which pokes fun at the manners and mores of a specific species of young, hip, upwardly mobile whites. (He has written more than 100 entries about whites&rsquo; passion for things like bottled water, &ldquo;the idea of soccer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;being the only white person around.&rdquo;) At its best, Lander&rsquo;s site &mdash; which formed the basis for a recently published book of the same name (reviewed in the October 2008 Atlantic) &mdash; is a cunningly precise distillation of the identity crisis plaguing well-meaning, well-off white kids in a post-white world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like, I&rsquo;m aware of all the horrible crimes that my demographic has done in the world,&rdquo; Lander says. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a bunch of white people who are desperate &mdash; desperate &mdash; to say, &lsquo;You know what? My skin&rsquo;s white, but I&rsquo;m not one of the white people who&rsquo;s destroying the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Lander, whiteness has become a vacuum. The &ldquo;white identity&rdquo; he limns on his blog is predicated on the quest for authenticity &mdash; usually other people&rsquo;s authenticity. &ldquo;As a white person, you&rsquo;re just desperate to find something else to grab onto. You&rsquo;re jealous! Pretty much every white person I grew up with wished they&rsquo;d grown up in, you know, an ethnic home that gave them a second language. White culture is Family Ties and Led Zeppelin and Guns N&rsquo; Roses &mdash; like, this is white culture. This is all we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lander&rsquo;s &ldquo;white people&rdquo; are products of a very specific historical moment, raised by well-meaning Baby Boomers to reject the old ideal of white American gentility and to embrace diversity and fluidity instead. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that we are the kids of Baby Boomers, right? How the hell do you rebel against that? Like, your parents will march against the World Trade Organization next to you. They&rsquo;ll have bigger white dreadlocks than you. What do you do?&rdquo;) But his lighthearted anthropology suggests that the multicultural harmony they were raised to worship has bred a kind of self-denial.</p>
<p>Matt Wray, a sociologist at Temple University who is a fan of Lander&rsquo;s humor, has observed that many of his white students are plagued by a racial-identity crisis: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care about socioeconomics; they care about culture. And to be white is to be culturally broke. The classic thing white students say when you ask them to talk about who they are is, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have a culture.&rsquo; They might be privileged, they might be loaded socioeconomically, but they feel bankrupt when it comes to culture &hellip; They feel disadvantaged, and they feel marginalized. They don&rsquo;t have a culture that&rsquo;s cool or oppositional.&rdquo;</p>

Well of course, can&rsquo;t let the white whipping boy and scapegoat get to far away. The white man is needed to blame for everyone else&rsquo;s shortcomings. If the white man ain&rsquo;t around non-whites would have to take responsibility for their failures.</p>

		<p>Demographically speaking, whites ARE losers, as their higher intellect leads to higher culture, which in turns leads to lower birth rates.  This wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem in a closed system, but now whites are in a reproductive competition with the rest of the world.  And we WILL lose.</p>
<p>The great tragedy is, of course, our superior culture will be overrun by that of lesser, but more fecund, groups.  The loss will be both ours and the world&rsquo;s.  I truly believe we are at the cusp of the next Dark Age, figuratively and literally.</p>

<p>As always, the author bemoans the inevitable collapse of White power and dominion in the United States with utterly weak examples.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hsu we are on the sociological decline because of a token half-Black President and Indian governor who needed millions of White votes to win.</p>
<p>We must also be doomed for eternity because of competition in the sports, media, and entertainment industries?    How many serious young White professionals do you know that are so inept that they would even pursue a career in such fields?  However lets not forget that Whites still sell more records, are more represented in sport, and are overwhelmingly cast in media over all other groups. </p>
<p>When White folks stop being the majority of corporate CEO&rsquo;s, lawyers, neurosurgeons, pilots, and congressional representatives then I will worry.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Hsu, the man you quote is correct.  I do feel under siege.  Not just by the hordes of non-Europeans who have come here to rob my country rather than embrace it, but even more so by the slick silver-tongued invaders in suits like yourself who tell me I need to &#8220;sit at the table&#8221; and talk about diversity.  Yet you lament my marginalization and lack of sense of culture  &mdash;  - mere conjecture sir.   </p>

		<p>A country where Blacks are in control is by definition NOT Western and will NOT have the liberal attributes that make America what it is. Remember, folks like Noel Ignatiev are in this because they get off on getting people to truly believe stupid stuff based on academic argument, not self-interest.</p>
<p>You see this stuff all the time when a cosmopolitan argues in favor of disarming YOU while at the same time making sure THEY have the ability to access a firearm while hiding in gated communities. As Charlton Heston pointed during the LA riots of the Clinton Administration, people who were known as rabid gun controllers were callin HIM asking if they could borrow a gun.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Of course, the obvious material advantages that come with being born white &mdash; lower infant-mortality rates and easier-to-acquire bank loans, for example &mdash; tend to undercut any sympathy that this sense of marginalization might generate. &#8220;</p>
<p>Asians have lower infant mortality rates and better credit ratings than whites. Is this an &#8220;obvious material advantage&#8221; that comes with being Asian?</p>
<p>I wonder what Mr. Hsu would think about Chinese despised becoming a minority in China? Would he think it &#8220;racist&#8221; if the Chinese object to this?</p>

		<p>As always, I am dismayed by the number of my fellow White readers who cannot fathom what is transpiring. </p>
<p>My friends, the root cause of our decline is the combined effort of the most elite White politicians and White corporate owners. Blacks, Mestizos, Muslims, and mongrels do what the most powerful Whites arrange for them to do. No more and no less. </p>
<p>The entire multicultual charade is a vehicle to transport resources from weak Whites to strong Whites. Minorities<br>
are pawns in the process. They are the most gullible and the easiest to manipulate because of their low intelligence and poor decision-making abilities.</p>
<p>The strongest Whites are not interested in cultural preservation. They are interested in accumulating more wealth. They are far, far removed and fully insulated from the things we complain about each day here. If the world declines to only a handful of the most elite Whites, they will be fine. Do you think they care about you?</p>

		<p>Some of the things he says are true, and there was much in this article that was interesting.  However, some of it was like this howler:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.but the demographic shifts of the next 40 years are likely to reduce the power of racial hierarchies over everyone&rsquo;s lives, producing a culture that&rsquo;s more likely than any before to treat its inhabitants as individuals, rather than members of a caste or identity group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is he high?  Group identity is already becoming more important than individual identity -  e.g., the identification of certain congressional seats as &#8220;black seats&#8221; or &#8220;woman seats&#8221; or &#8220;hispanic seats&#8221;, or the profusion of &#8220;Association of black or hispanic fill-in-the-blank-occupation&#8221;.  Or, as he discusses in his essay, the rise of white blue-collar affinity groups.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu is probably a 1st generation immigrant from China, or perhaps 2nd.  He should ask himself this:  If America is the nation it is - rather than being like, say, Brazil - because of it&rsquo;s white majority (and if he&rsquo;s honest, he will agree that it is), then there was a reason why he, or his parents, came here, rather than Brazil, and there is a reason why he continues to live here.  Maybe he should think about what that means, for him, and us.  He perhaps can go back to a monolithic mother-country if this great multicultural experiment goes bad.  We can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or how about asking someone what our numbers are worldwide. Usually the guess is around 25%. When I tell them 8% and falling some have a look of disbelief and a small few a look of dismay.</p>
<p>Posted by Tim Mc Hugh at 6:03 PM on January 7&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I agree, I think a lot of people just don&rsquo;t appreciate how small a minority whites have become worldwide.  Another thing one might try persuading people of is the following: black americans have spent alot of time (and still do) bemoaning the fact that they are minority.  Well?  Maybe they have a point.  Maybe it ain&rsquo;t so hot to be a minority.  Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t want to be one either.  And as long as we still aren&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s try to avoid becoming one in our own lands.</p>

		<p>Earlier this evening I found this article on the blog &#8220;View From the Right&#8221;. A link was provided to the Free Republic thread on this article.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise there were a number of posters who were quite blatant and upfront about the link between Western civilization, the American variant especially, and race, ethnicity, even religion. It was a delight to read well-thought out arguments in favor of our civilization, even more so to read how Western concepts of freedom, social and political organization, and economic and industrial development were necessarily connected with race, the white race.<br>
 <br>
That Republican party strength and power depended on maintaining a white majority was also touched upon.<br>
 <br>
Of course, what would a conservative forum be without angry non-whites exhibiting a sense of racialist triumphalism at the demise of white America? And what conservative forum could exist without &#8220;conservatives&#8221; telling how we must bend over backwards to attract the votes of these non-whites? Both these &#8220;conservative&#8221; types were present. Let&rsquo;s say they got a good talking-to by the real conservatives!<br>
 <br>
For those who don&rsquo;t know, Free Republic is a &#8220;conservative&#8221; site, conservative in the manner of the neocons, the Republican party establishment, and &#8220;house conservatives&#8221; such as George Will et al. <br>
 <br>
About 40 minutes ago I went back to the article, determined to post a few responses in support of those &#8220;incorrect&#8221; posters.<br>
 <br>
Alas, &#8220;This thread has been pulled&#8221;. Pulled on 01/07/2009 5:13:09 PM PST by Admin Moderator</p>

		<p>By adding blacks and hispanics, you are mearly lowering the AVERAGE IQ in America, and bumping up the aggression from an all white culture.- How could this possibly be beneficial to &#8216;civilization&rsquo;? It is only beneficial to blacks and hispanics who live amongst whites.</p>
<p>One must remember that these brainwashed masses shout about the joys of multi-cultism, but fail to look at the NEGATIVE aspects of (mainly) black &#8220;achievment&#8221;, and hispanic &#8216;achievment. </p>
<p>Note that this idiotic article is about an &#8220;entertainment&#8221; mogul- entertainment, song and dance (and sports) being where blacks have always excelled, not about a rocket scientist, or software engineer. No  equivelent exists for latino&rsquo;s at this point, to my knowledge. Latinos do not produce music atthe level of popularity.</p>
<p>The culture is degrading, yet people are mainly unaware of it because of white flight.</p>
<p>This also precludes ignoring the fact that blacks and latinos will not anytime soon be entering the economic levels of those &#8216;boring white people&rsquo;, and as a matter of fact, helped crash our economy due to a major brain-drain.</p>
<p>This prediction, as well as all pro black and latino &#8216;predictions&rsquo; are not based on reality, or analysis that is available, but on the alturistic, racist, anti-white pixi dust fantasy of an ignorant intractable. The world they think they want is a nightmare of violence, anti-intellectual, debased, degenerate reality, in comparison to boring old white people.</p>
<p>Black pepper is a great additive to your meal, but a meal made of 1/2 black pepper is quite unsettling.</p>

		<p>I wrote this short essay in response to Hua Hsu&rsquo;s boastful, gloating essay.  I would have liked to post it as a comment to the article, but it seems the Atlantic does not provide for such.  So I shall post it here.</p>
<p>Mr. (?) Hsu:<br>
Don&rsquo;t be so sure.</p>
<p>In the stock market, once a trend is firmly in place, &#8220;prognosticators&#8221; tend to project the trend to infinity.  But, darn it, just when everyone is SURE it only goes up (or down) the trend changes, catching the masses flatfooted.</p>
<p>The above principal applies in an astonishing number of areas life, including demographics.</p>
<p>Now that one of our much-lauded &#8220;multiethnic, multicultural heirs&#8221; is gloating in the pages of the Atlantic that the riches of the United States will soon be &#8220;mine, all mine,&#8221;  I, prognosticator that I am, prognosticate that you and the other &#8220;m.m. heirs&#8221; may, in 2040, find yourselves NOT &#8220;booking your profits&#8221; but &#8220;booking&#8221; for your lives.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s economy is in shambles due to our heralded &#8220;multicultural, multiethnic heirs.&#8221;  Soon the m.m. heirs may well be running home as fast as their feet can carry them.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because history repeats.  </p>
<p>Time and again, against astonishing odds, white men have demonstrated that when the gauntlet is finally and truly thrown and home and family are really, truly, in jeopardy, they fight.  And they win.  </p>
<p>When fighting for his home and his family and his country, an army consisting of white men is the only unstoppable force known on earth.  </p>
<p>In fact, Nazi Germany, the super power of the 1930s, was only defeated by another army composed of what?  Aztecs?   Chinese?  Zulu warriors?  No.  White men.  In fact, Japan, composed as she as of fierce Japanese shogun warriors who, even, were willing to die by flying their airplanes into Allied aircraft carriers, were defeated by white men.  White men who, when homeland was truly threatened, used their creativity and resolve to develop the only weapon capable of defeating the Japanese   &mdash;   the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>White men are tolerant.  White men are longsuffering.  White men prefer diplomacy.  But when they must, they fight   &mdash;   and they win.  And when they have re-secured their homelands, watch the white-baby birthrate skyrocket.</p>
<p>Trends change, dude.  Still, enjoy your hubris while you can.<br>

		<p>The mere fact that someone called Hua Hsu teaches English at Vassar tells you all you need to know about what sort of third-world pig pen this nation is rapidly becoming. The quotes from the students are also telling, as is the response to them of the kids&rsquo; reeducation camp directors, er, professors. Sure, the kids are alienated from their own civilization (those twelve years of &#8220;education&#8221; have worked according to plan) and, to the extent they&rsquo;re aware of that civilization at all they regard it with abject horror (Why go to university at all? The institution was invented by Dead White Males, you know.), and that&rsquo;s a good thing, but they are still Type Two Kulaks, incompletely reformed, and insufficiently aware of the &#8220;privilege&#8221; being white is supposed to bring. How awful. It&rsquo;s not enough that these students&rsquo; nation is being colonized out from under them; they&rsquo;re not flagellating themselves enough. What kind of pathological, chronic masochism must be at work in our civilization when whites take solace from being told by some parasitic &#8220;diversity&#8221; bureacrat that &#8220;it&rsquo;s ok to be white?&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;I try to bring up these issues with co-workers, friends, and family but few of them are willing to listen or talk about these issues. I don&rsquo;t know if they don&rsquo;t care, don&rsquo;t see the issue, or if they&rsquo;re aware of it but ignore it or are afraid of hearing or discussing the truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>To BuffaloNative; Another whites-rights person mentioned something similar to this to me in an e-mail. I&rsquo;m not sure if he was trying to be ironic. . I think he was. . but he said something like, &#8220;I bring up the issue (of stereotyping, slurs or offences against whites) and a white guy will be there saying &#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel offended&#8221;. You shouldn&rsquo;t let that stop you. If you bring up the issue and are ignored don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;re not having some kind of an effect. The listener will most likely remember what you&rsquo;ve said later. It&rsquo;s best to allow people to draw their own conclusions. We don&rsquo;t always have the right answer. The less pushy you are about it and the more subtle you are the better impression you&rsquo;ll likely leave. Keep in mind that sites like this seem like a virtual training ground for learning ways to turn people away from you. Everyone gets their training somewhere. You might not always be being trained the way you think you are.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;many of his white students are plagued by a racial-identity crisis: &#8216;They don&rsquo;t care about socioeconomics; they care about culture&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re students.  Wait until they graduate and try to land jobs in their chosen fields and find out that &#8216;Whites need not apply.&rsquo; </p>
<p>When they are locked out of jobs and careers, forced to live in non-White multi-culti neighborhoods, are forced to accept a declining standard of living, are debased at every turn  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s see then how much they care about culture.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;There will be dislocations and resentments along the way&hellip;producing a culture that&rsquo;s more likely than any before to treat its inhabitants as individuals, rather than members of a caste or identity group&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Once Whites become a minority, America as it was initially formed and intended to be will cease to exist.  That which made America great  &mdash;  the prosperity that arose from our Constitution and Rule of Law  &mdash;  the very things that attracted non-Whites to the US in the first place  &mdash;  peoples who were not able to form safe, prosperous civilizations in their own countries  &mdash;  will be dead and gone.  Non-Whites are not able to sustain a system created by Whites.</p>
<p>In California, this destruction has already started as its legislature has been taken over by race-based non-White socialists who are ONLY interested in promoting and advocating for their own. It is anything but a government that &#8216;treat(s) its inhabitants as individuals, rather than members of a caste or identity group.&rsquo;  ALL government in California is race/ethnic-based.</p>
<p>California is an example of what this entire country will become, soon, as Whites disappear.</p>
<p>The following was written by another Asian  &mdash;  are you listening Mr. Hsu?  This is what happens when non-Whites who have no understanding of the Rule of Law or (non-statist) Econ 101 try to run a system created BY Whites FOR White:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;[California] state revenue grew more than 30% over the last four years&hellip;California is spending 40% more than four years ago, but on what, exactly?&hellip;To bring the budget into balance, the state now has to reduce the rate of spending growth or raise taxes.</p>
<p>The Legislature wants to increase the income tax on high-earners&hellip;California&rsquo;s statewide sales tax of 7.25% is already the highest in the nation. Income taxes are also high, with the 10.3% rate on the top income bracket the highest in the nation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-matsusaka17-2008jul17%2C0%2C7957570.story" rel="nofollow">https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-matsusaka17-2008jul17%2C0%2C7957570.story</a></p>
<p>Good Luck to you Mr. Hsu and all other White haters who gleefully await our demise.  When we are gone, this country will resemble whatever &#8216;culture&rsquo; you fled from to come here  &mdash;  Socialism?  Communism? Totalitarianism? Authoritarian or Police State? Endless racial warfare? Or perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to live in one of the coming Theocracies of Europe?</p>
<p>Free Markets, the Rule of Law, Prosperous Economies, Peace, Safety and Security, Inventiveness and Creativity will be dim memories when Whites are gone.</p>
<p>As after the Roman Empire fell, there will be another Dark Age when the civilization created by Whites collapses.  The last Dark Age  &mdash;   lasted nine centuries.</p>

		<p>Most Whites in America think that if they pretend our country and our race are not in a crisis, then we aren&rsquo;t.  They want to live in denial and imagine everything is just peachy.  To think otherwise is just too painful for them because, I think, they are emotionally immature.  (I&rsquo;m sure our ancestors were able to identify and deal with reality.)  </p>
<p>If we try to explain current events it either a) angers them because we are disturbing their happy image of the world; or b) bores them because they don&rsquo;t believe us.  They are truly brainwashed by our schools and media, and it will take living like the Whites do in South Africa for them to wake up!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Matt Wray, a sociologist at Temple University who is a fan of Lander&rsquo;s humor, has observed that many of his white students are plagued by a racial-identity crisis: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care about socioeconomics; they care about culture. And to be white is to be culturally broke. The classic thing white students say when you ask them to talk about who they are is, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have a culture.&rsquo; They might be privileged, they might be loaded socioeconomically, but they feel bankrupt when it comes to culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
One needn&rsquo;t do more than try to walk around Temple&rsquo;s campus which is an integral part of the surrounding North Philadelphia neighborhood to see what a nightmare the non- White culture has wrought. As a commuter graduate student at Temple in the mid sixties, I wss attacked in the Susquehanna Avenue subway station and had to fight my way onto the train to escape. In one year several coeds were sexually assaulted in the old Sullivan Library and a law student was fatally shot in the head while getting into his car and there were a huge number of muggings and robberies that were not quite so spectacular and didn&rsquo;t get much media attention.  THings are just as bad now if not worse.</p>
<p> Right after self-hating whites, I&rsquo;m nauseated by Asians who want to include all non- WHites in the same group as though there were a symbiotic relationship. Blacks and Hispanics hate Asians as much as they do Whites. Asians in Latin American countries are the biggest target of crimes as well as of jokes. Here in what used to be America they come right after Whites as members of the victim pool of Blacks and Hispanics. There is a classic Mexican Corrido ( a running narrative set to music) entitled La Cárcel de Cananea that tells about the misfortune of a man who was arrested for murdering a Chinese family. LInda Ronstadt sings it on her album Canciones de mi Padre- Songs of my Father. </p>
<p>Bottom line- just about every benefit that mankind enjoys today is the product of White genius and creativiity from science to medicine to the fine arts.  Were there wrongs committed? To be sure but they are far outweighed by the noble achievements of Europeans and Euro- Americans. Once we and our culture are obliterated, this planet will be ripe for the taking by those who are out there.<br>

		<p><i>&#8220;Demographically speaking, whites ARE losers, as their higher intellect leads to higher culture, which in turns leads to lower birth rates. This wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem in a closed system, but now whites are in a reproductive competition with the rest of the world. &#8220;</i></p>
<p>Formerly, for many centuries,  indeed for thousands of years, Europe was a  &#8220;closed system&#8221;.  Even the various European nations themselves were, for the most part, excepting occasional (rare) migrations, &#8220;closed systems&#8221;.   Now, all that has changed. It&rsquo;s no longer so.  The white man&rsquo;s great inventions:   the airplane, the steamship, the telephone and telegraph (for wiring money back home!), and  the Internet   &mdash;   the banking system and industrialization&hellip;even modern vaccines and medicine, chemistry, genetics, and  &#8220;miracle&#8221; seeds and fertilizers   &mdash;    have all proven an untold  (and unearned)  boon to the Third World masses, and simultaneously the whites&rsquo; greatest curse. We didn&rsquo;t anticipate the ramifications and regulate them for our benefit.</p>
<p><i>The great tragedy is, of course, our superior culture will be overrun by that of lesser, but more fecund, groups. The loss will be both ours and the world&rsquo;s. I truly believe we are at the cusp of the next Dark Age, figuratively and literally.<br>
Posted by We&rsquo;re Screwed </i></p>
<p>I share your concern. (You wrote a very provocative post.)   I note that, historically, the break-up and collapse (or better  said, the death) of great empires seems to be accompanied by great migrations,  Rome being the classic example,  as the barbarian hordes swarm in to feed off the dying colossus&rsquo;  corpse.   We are seeing that right now, before our eyes.   The once-powerful and feared British, French, Spanish, and Dutch  (empires)have collapsed and are being  swamped by a backwash of their former colonial  peoples.  And the American empire as well.   Yet the corpses don&rsquo;t seem to notice, and they offer no resistance!    </p>
<p>Like any healthy organism that has a  strong immune system to fend off foreign parasites, a strong and healthy nation will  vigorously defend its territory and its gene pool.  But an effete and sickly one - even moribund -  cannot rouse itself to make the effort at self-defense.  It lies there helplessly as it is invaded by foreign bodies.  So with nations and empires.  I see in Europe today the perfect example of that    &mdash;   a still rich but degenerate empire that is too sick, too feeble, to defend itself as the parasites come swarming in to feast.   It is a repeat performance of what happened two thousand years ago.  But the peoples pouring into Rome then were other Europeans.  The  New Dark Age will be darker this time.<br>

I thought of the contrast between now and the cartons I watched as a kid. Then you had a cast of white characters with very different individual personas.

		<p>The fact that whites have no sense of even having a culture is bizarre - unles &#8220;culture&#8221; is defined as sports + pop music.</p>
<p>Euopean culture is invisible because it is ubiquitous:<br>
Europeans invented pretty much all the &#8220;Stuff Earthlings Like&#8221;.</p>
<p>At 8% of world population, we are a minority too but - with influence VASTLY beyond out numbers.</p>
<p>Europeans should do 3 things:</p>
<p>1) breed more, esp. from the right hand of the bell curve, </p>
<p><br>
2) raise our kids to respect themselves and their own cultural heritage - study and maintain our immensely rich cultural heritage.<br>
 <br>
3) push policies that motivate 3rd world immigrants to breed less and/or return home.</p>
<p>Whining and fatalism are signs that Europoeans really have lost the will to live.</p>

		<p>I would say the Druid has it exactly backwards.  There is no Christian non-white America, and there is no white non-Christian America. The attack on the white race is inadvertent.  The real attack is the attack on Christianity, especially the Catholic Church.  The white race is collateral damage.</p>
<p>The Christian family mirrors the Christian universe.  It has order and hierarchy.  Christians, especially Catholics do not believe in equality.  They believe in hierarchy.  They believe in authority.  </p>
<p>This is clear from the race mixing problem.  The mixing of races and the displacement of the white race has been the outcome of the war against Christian sexual mores. If black men had to court, with no sex, then marry and raise their offspring, there would be no interracial children.  Obama is the perfect example.</p>
<p>Marriage and the patriarchal family was the first institution of Christian culture to crumble under the attack on Christianity.   The most important institution in Western civilization was the family.  Family has an order, husband-father, above, wife below and children.  Sex outside marriage was forbidden, for both husband and wife.</p>
<p>Another vital institution of the West was the Church as independent entity free from state control and a check on the state.  The state had to pay homage to the Church, there was no such nonsensical notion as separation between Church and State.</p>
<p>Targeting minorities is misguided.  Minorities are only the grape shot that the enemies of Christian America are firing at white Christian America.  Let&rsquo;s be honest minorities are just not intelligent enough to carry out such a plan.</p>
<p>Minority immigration is often brought up as a proof that Christianity is in league with the forces destroying white race.  All God&rsquo;s children are equally entitles to America&rsquo;s riches.  Not so.  The anti-Christian forces are behind the flow of non-whites into America.  The Christian position is that people in other countries are subjects for charity and missionary work.  The same holds for the poor in America; they need charity not government hand outs with no stipulations.  </p>
<p>The Christian institutions are what have held Western culture in place.  Our anger should be directed at those who are destroying Christian institutions.  Know who your real enemy is.  Your enemy is in the courts and legislature demanding abortion, no fault divorce, pornography, and homosexual rights, separation of Church and state, and equality for all.</p>
<p>Your enemy has white men and women dying in the Middle East.  He is bankrupting America with the war, with the National Bank, and with taxes to support anti-white programs.</p>
<p>There are men and women here and there who can live contentedly without religion.  They have their white race as an ultimate good, but they are few in number.  A religious culture is necessary for the almost every one.   <br>

		<p>&#8220;Today, hip-hop&rsquo;s colonization of the global imagination, from fashion runways in Europe to dance competitions in Asia, is Disney-esque. This transformation has bred an unprecedented cultural confidence in its black originators.&#8221;</p>
<p>  I hardly think today&rsquo;s international hip-hop culture compares favorably with the previous great ages of Western civilization: Classical, Renaissance, Reformation, Baroque, and Enlightenment. Hip-hop offers little in the way of permanent artistic excellence. Who could compare LiL, Wayne, Snoop Dog  or Mr. Combs with Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Da Vinci, Bernini, Titian, Voltaire, Botticelli, etc., it would be absurd. Only a sick society lacking in confidence would &#8220;celebrate&#8221; this self destructive, primitive, uncreative, hip-hop drivel. Our educational system is to blame for much of this destructive cultural relativism. </p>

		<p>Am I the only American here disgusted by the patronizing, arrogant tone of this alien colonist in MY country, a smug creep who has taken a cushy, academic job away from a more qualified white man?</p>
<p>Let us be clear, though, that unless whites en masse rediscover the Racial Principle, we can, AT BEST, expect ever more of this alien gloating at our accelerating, self-imposed racial dispossession - to be followed, of course, by the most vicious tyranny whites will ever have experienced this side of communism. Are we prepared to accept this fate apathetically, at most grumbling away on sites like AR?</p>
<p>White nationalism is the only answer to the crisis of the West. We must all work unceasingly to get our message across to our white fellows, to build economic and political networks amongst ourselves, and to challenge these smug aliens EVERYWHERE and at ALL times. How many whiners here have emailed a response or complaint to THE ATLANTIC, presenting our case, chastising that magazine for publishing such drivel, and affirming that you are a proud white person determined to fight ever harder not merely to retain, but to reestablish on a sounder footing, the old white order of America?</p>
<p>There is an increasing air of defeatism around some of the AR posters, here and at other times. Remember Leonidas and the 300, and roll up your sleeves! We have the work of reconquest and re-civilization to do. The work of white men! </p>

		<p>Breeders rule yuppies drool.</p>
<p>Whites had better adapt to the modern realities of almost instant communication that shows the best places to live and the mass transportation that allows others to go there.</p>
<p>And, whites had better erect walls all around their better places to live or breed as we once did so that the internal population pressures act as a bar for easy entry.</p>
<p>But what are whites doing?  In many formerly white nations they&rsquo;re actually importing labor because the feeble whites aren&rsquo;t breeding their own workers.</p>
<p>Right on this site, you&rsquo;ll see supposedly bright whites arguing that we shouldn&rsquo;t breed.  And, they give the usual yuppie reasons about quality of life, not wanting to bring children into a bad world, don&rsquo;t want to be a burden on others, can&rsquo;t afford them,etc.  Absurd.</p>

<p>Hua Hsu is an Asian-American writer and needs to earn a crust by being provocative as well as entertaining. Good luck to him too - he&rsquo;s been published in the prestigious &#8216;Atlantic&rsquo;! </p>
<p>Does anyone doubt where Hua Hsu would choose to live if offered a simple choice between a law-abiding mainly-white suburb or a crime-ridden inner-city ghetto?</p>
<p>THE FACTS:<br>
Yellows have far more in common with whites than they do with blacks or the far-from-homogenous people puzzlingly lumped together as &#8216;Hispanics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Look at all the easily-measured indices:</p>
<p>* Juvenile delinquency and anti-social behavior</p>
<p>* School dropout rates</p>
<p>* College attendance and graduation</p>
<p>* Positive contribution to the community; patents won, brain surgery operations performed and so on &hellip;</p>
<p>* Rates of incarceration in penal institutions</p>
<p>Concerning this last, Japanese-Americans are claimed to have the very highest rate of high school graduation and the very lowest rate of incarceration. Sure, right now there are Vietnamese-American and Cambodian-American criminal gangs, just as there were - and still are - gangs based on Italian and Irish ethnicities, but the broad pattern of social integration is plain. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true across the Pacific, too. Massed choirs in Osaka perform Beethoven&rsquo;s &#8216;Ode to Joy&rsquo;, not some hip-hop garbage. And the long-memoried will recall an unsettling period of dire strife involving black Africans in China, a country in which blacks are regarded with little esteem.</p>

If this country becomes non-White, it will no longer be a first world country but will come to remeble Brazil or Mexico and the non-Whites who are here will lose the benefits of living in a first world country. This country will become what non-Whites fled in the first place. The truly insane thing is that Whites are doing it to themselves.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Arguably, this white identity politics helped swing the 2000 and 2004 elections, serving as the powerful counterpunch to urban white liberals, and the McCain-Palin campaign relied on it almost to the point of absurdity (as when a McCain surrogate dismissed Northern Virginia as somehow not part of &#8216;the real Virginia&rsquo;) as a bulwark against the threatening multiculturalism of Barack Obama. Their strategy failed, of course, but it&rsquo;s possible to imagine white identity politics growing more potent and more forthright in its racial identifications in the future, as &#8216;the real America&rsquo; becomes an ever-smaller portion of, well, the real America, and as the soon-to-be white minority&rsquo;s sense of being besieged and disdained by a multicultural majority grows apace.&#8221;</p>
<p>What strikes me about the above, to quote the &#8220;insightful&#8221; Comrade Hua Hsu, as being: &#8220;the point of absurdity,&#8221; is that we endlessly see such anxiously gleeful proclamations by Reds and nonwhites here at AR declaring White America, the True America, dead and buried.

<p>They are combining the music with drugs to goad more white women into complying with their sexual demands, and more white men into acquiesing.</p>
<p>Obama and others want to declare the drug war a failure, and legalize drugs.</p>
<p>I like the idea of legalizing drugs, but only with the establishment of huge import duties and tariffs, to prevent the US and other drug poor Northern Hemisphere nations from becoming economically subservient to drug rich Southern Hemisphere nations.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent us from becoming economic slaves to drug rich Southern Hemisphere nations, is to make them pay richly into our tax coffers to bring their drugs into our country and state.</p>
<p>Taxing the end products at the counter would only increase the economic burdens on our own citizens, and allow the drug importing Southern nations to get rich at our expense.</p>
<p>We must make the drug rich Southern nations pay richly for the privelege of importing drugs into our country.</p>
<p>We also have to close the borders to any more of their human interlopers, so we can set about rebuilding the economic strength of our state, country and people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I tried to used these articles as an opportunity to bring up the issue of whites being disproportionate victims of black violence and gauge their reactions. Neither of them expressed any interest or concern. They both looked at me as if they had no understanding of what I was talking about and no interest in the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that look many times. It&rsquo;s a blank cowlike expression of total indifference mixed with wariness and incomprehension. I call it the &#8220;lemming stare.&#8221;</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t understand what you were talking about and they weren&rsquo;t interested, but they got nervous because they sensed you were saying something Forbidden that might get them in trouble just for listening to it.</p>
<p>Most people seem to be like this now. You can&rsquo;t reach them with intellectual arguments. They&rsquo;re so dumbed down, brainwashed, timid and willfully ignorant that they&rsquo;re incapable of independent thought. The only way to get through to them is to flatter them or scare them or appeal to their emotions and basic instincts. The media, politicians and advertising agencies figured this out a long time ago.</p>

<i>&#8220;This is the wrong way to look at it.  If every minority race can celebrate itself in pure form, then as a white majority loses ground, it should increasingly celebrate itself, too.&#8221;<br>
Posted at 7:38 PM </i><br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;    <br>
But why only minorities?   Shouldn&rsquo;t everyone be free to &#8220;celebrate&#8221;  themselves? &hellip; even if not a minority?<br>
Why should  the special staus of &#8220;minority&#8221;  have anything to do with it?  Why should it be a privileged status at all?</p>
<p><br>
To answer my own question:  it is because  certain organized, militant minorities have consciously and intensively promoted their own interests over the years to the point where they have become our &#8216;holy&rsquo; minorities &hellip;  &#8220;Minority&#8221; itself has been transformed into a special-status word, coming to imply unique privileges that are not extended to all.   These &#8220;protected groups&#8221;  must be deferred to,  agreed with, never criticized, and  granted every demand.   Everything they do is laudable. Their mistakes  are overlooked, their achievements inflated,  their crimes minimized, ignored, or forgiven.  They are above reproach,  and woe to those who  question or disrespect them.  (You could be accused of a Hate Crime, or at least called the most awful of  career-destroying epithets: a racist or bigot.)   </p>
<p>Minorities have become America&rsquo;s holy cows!</p>
<p>But nothing is by mere accident.   By vigorous self-promotion, they have MADE themselves sacrosanct and put THEMSELVES on pedestals.  And we have supinely  allowed it.</p>

		<p>The element of humor in this essay being that without Whites and their influence, without the knowledge, learning and culture bestowed by Whites on the world&rsquo;s non-White population,those non-Whites would still be thousands of years from where they are today!!!</p>
<p>Asia countries still stagnating in feudalism. Africa still at a barely past-Stone Age stage of development. Mired in endless tribal warefare, brutal barbarism even worse than in today&rsquo;s &#8220;enlightened&#8221; Africa.</p>
<p>Were the White race to die out, say in a century, the rest of the world would probably not survive two, at most three centuries, before having regressed to the status held in 1,000 A.D. Wondering if this very likely probability occurred to our worthy Hua Hsu. Certainly the reality that Orientals are great imitators but fall very short on imagination and innovation never crossed his mind.</p>
<p>That Whites are less prolific than those mindlessly over-breeding third-world countries, is largely a matter of choice. Those overbreeding third-world baby factories are ultimately still depending on White nations to come to their rescue, the truth being these countries have brainlessly OUTBRED their capacity to feed and care for their people. The ONLY non-White nation with any rationality respective to controlling population size being China. Those Latin-American, other Asian and African countries&hellip; THEY will destroy our world rather quickly, if they don&rsquo;t wake up to the fact our planet can only sustain a certain number of human beings.</p>

		<p>One big flaw in this thoughtful essay are Mr. Hsu&rsquo;s remarks about hip-hop&rsquo;s contributions to the changes in American and world culture as a positive transforming device.  When everything is over the top, we track child molesters but Macy&rsquo;s sells girl&rsquo;s clothes that make them look like sluts, the newest sex shock for sale is the headline news - it is obvious to those of us who Mr. Hsu defined as the lower middle class Whites who want to go back to better days are right to want to escape a culture that every single day is nauseating in its vulgarity and crastness.  That a successful culture could come from such foundations and practicies is - I&rsquo;m going to step out big here - IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p>It seems that the spiritual tipping point has already occured and Mr. Hsu points it out. Most White youth appear to wish to escape their Whiteness, their very skin.  He doesn&rsquo;t however, point out that public schools have been for decades teaching Whites shame in a manner that could only amount to national subversion through robbing its youth of identity with their proud past.  What is left over from all this won&rsquo;t be so wonderful.</p>
<p>Yes, some of us Whites are lost in historical re-enactment lifestyles as I used to be.  I slapped myself out of it as too much of a diversion from reality.  But I am also seeing that I lost the only thing that gave any relief to the daily menu of disgusting and usually commercial exploitation of the human spirit.</p>
<p>So my home reflects the past, antique furniture, and all decorations harken back to a time when people were more civilized than not.  Humans aren&rsquo;t perfect, but just because Whites did not do it perfectly is no reason to replace all the good ideas that were there - to throw out the baby with the bathwater as my generation did - with the imagined opposite to decency at every turn.  And then to call it justice and decency is the proof that my first paragraph is a valid prediction.</p>
<p>I consider myself as standing on watch, as if at a funeral service, paying my respects to the dying, but hoping for a rally that seems unlikely.  One item Mr. Hsu is correct in my opinion, is that WW1, was really a European civil war that occured because at the dawn of what should have been the White races opus deluxe of a thousand years of peace and progress for the entire world, a war was allowed to break out for the pettiest of reasons.  All we are seeing is the steady decline since 1914.  Will there be a rally?  I don&rsquo;t know, but I doubt it.  And I doubt that a Black man will lead it however promising BO&rsquo;s approaching tenure in office appears to the masses.  </p>
<p>One thing that is certain, Whites cannot look to Obama for fair treatment because he would be accused of favoring the Whites who have arrived at their final designation as undesireable citizens set for replacement - and because he just won&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I suppose most of us won&rsquo;t be around, but I think we may see the beginning of the time when writers will begin to notice that things were better world wide when Whites &#8220;ruled.&#8221;  They are going to miss us when we&rsquo;re gone, I am certain of that.  It may start with a shortage of White women, but it will become more serious than that.</p>
<p>I am not an apocolyptic believer and I always double check myself when I think of the following; When I reflect on the population explosion that goes on unchecked and the downward turn of all societies due to the inherent impulses toward base motivations like greed, avarice, etc., and the impulse toward conflict that all humans carry, I think that this may after all be the outcome of the human species - our destiny.  That&rsquo;s all folks!</p>
<p>The future is nothing more than the crash of civilization into a mass of human organisms, pulsing and writhing in the dirt and poison, trying to find orfices for their useless organs. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Right on this site, you&rsquo;ll see supposedly bright whites arguing that we shouldn&rsquo;t breed. And, they give the usual yuppie reasons about quality of life, not wanting to bring children into a bad world, don&rsquo;t want to be a burden on others, can&rsquo;t afford them,etc. Absurd.</p>
<p>Those who die with the most children win. Get used to it. That&rsquo;s nature. &#8220;</p>
<p>Posted by JPT at 9:08 AM on January 8 </p>
<p>JPT -  But you are forgetting that we live on a planet that cannot bear a much larger human population.  Most wars now are for resources and these will grow and enlarge, just as Issac Asimov predicted.  The earth is a CLOSED culture, biologically speaking.  That means that there is a limit to how much life can be on it before it begins to die in its own by-products.  There have long been knowledge of how a closed culture&rsquo;s life span is traced.  We are at the point where a huge plunge in population of all living things will occur.  It is likely that only microscopic life forms will be left.  All biologists know this and it has long been well understood - a high school bio-lab can prove it.  The news is just too horrid for the average mind - BUT THAT IS NATURE - GET USED TO IT.</p>
<p>I suggest that the best idea is to birth and grow for quality not quantity.  Quantity is always the enemy of quality.  I see examples of that daily.  If there is any hope at all for any future for Whites (or anyone) it will be those who raised intelligent children, and raised them with a pride in who they are and their history.</p>

<p>Schoolteacher, great set of comments.  However, I think it might do Rednecks some good to stretch at little towards classic Western historic culture.  Otherwise, it will become intellectually inbred, (if it isn&rsquo;t already) and self-destructive.  It might already be there (self-destructing).  Sarah Palin - the poster conservative of the year - has a daughter that for all their Christian conservative values got pregnant out of wedlock.  It&rsquo;s a slippery slope from there.  I know Country Music, deer hunting, fishing, guys who love NASCAR who are raising their daughter&rsquo;s mulatto children.  It takes more than superficiality to produce a sustainable culture.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Christian god has already been exposed as championing multiculturalism on the sly. Christianity will become more and more &ldquo;de-Germanized&rdquo; and return to its radical, egalitarian roots in which &ldquo;inclusiveness&rdquo; will be emphasized over family, &ldquo;contributing&rdquo; over individual achievement, and &ldquo;love&rdquo; over noble behavior.&#8221;</p>

<p>Welcome, Druid&hellip;  I point out periodically on these posts how Christianity actually conquered Europe and is in fact an alien set of values that took on enough of the Old Religion&rsquo;s clothing to mask itself.  I do this to point out the contradiction to survival the White European peoples face in Christianity.  I welcome a new voice to the so far small chorus.  While not given to any superstition, I recognize that spirituality and ritual for the sake of community is important, but it ought to be one that supports the land and culture of the people who practice it. </p>

Posted by Walter Lewkowski at 5:02 AM on January 8 </p>
<p>I could not disagree with anyone (White) more than Mr. Lewkowski.  To me, the view through this man&rsquo;s argument is as clear as glass.  Christianity seeks to enlist people of all races and lands under its domain.  It takes the reflex of self preservation and turns it into &#8220;self denial,&#8221; &#8220;self-sacrifice,&#8221; etc.  It tells you to be a sheep, a child.  The RLC wants you to dwell on the vision of ancient Roman execution practices.  Imagine worshiping a gallows or an electric chair!  Get on your knees and bow to the execution of a Jewish rebel.  He&rsquo;s the new Mithra, don&rsquo;t you know?  The RLC is an empire and for a long time had its own army.  The RLC is a nation that requires allegiance beyond your own nation.  It is very eary to show that Christianity, especially the Catholic Church conquered Europe and suppressed and terrorized its people actively for a thousand years and less directly ever since.  Nearly every advance in Science and Art was done under duress and often secretly (from the Church) until it could no longer supress the inherent European intellect.  Greece and Rome with their historians and philosophers contributed much more to Western Civilizaiton than this Middle Eastern transplant.  Mr. Lewbowski is a blind agent of his church and the brainwashing done on him as a child.</p>
<p>Yet, I accept that most people do need a kind of religion and ritual for community and continuity.  Again, it ought to be one that does not take us from our rightful spiritual connections to our land and people as Christianity does.  Still, I would accept Christians among my fellow Whites as the realist that I am.  The problem is that as Mr. Lewbowski illustrates here, there are many Whites for whom being a Christian is just as fanatical a pre-requisite for inclusion as Islam is for a member of Al Queda.</p>
<p>Two errors don&rsquo;t equal a success.</p>
<p>A successful White movement that can go into the future needs to rid itself of the main impediments to its survival.  I am certain that regardless of all the sentiment people raised involuntarily and that nearly two thousand years of coersion has produced in many of us, Christianity will always be a bane to those who wish to survive and thrive in this life on this planet.</p>

		<p>Perhaps many White Americans of European ancestry do fear they have no culture, but they ignore the mastodon in the room. European Whites and their American cousins invented Modernity: the great Universities, theoretical and applied science, orchestral music, nuclear power, the internal combustion engine, banking and investment, the novel, the market economy, aviation, Advanced math and computing, diagnostic medicine, urban architecture, all branches of engineering, etc. Basically, we&rsquo;ve invented almost everything worth inventing. THIS is White culture so it&rsquo;s impossible to imagine the age of White Culture EVER ending. Or stagnating. There is certainly  no evidence that Euro Whites either in America or around the world are becoming any less creative or ambitious (the iPod, the Mac, the internet, the Windows operating system, all invented by White nerds) so our outsize influence is highly unlikely to end. </p>
<p>For Euro Whites, fully appreciating their cultural heritage is extremely tough because of its incredible sophistication; high levels of literacy, numeracy, and intellectual discipline are required. (Can that be said about Mexican or African culture? Well, umm&hellip;) Indeed, the coming Euro White Renaissance should be an educational one in which we embrace our science, literature, history, and art and take full possession of it by teaching it to our children from the earliest years. Let the Africans have Biggie Smalls and Hip Hop. Let Hispanics have Selena. Ludvig Van is MY man!</p>
<p>There is irony in the situation Euro Whites face, as our relative numbers decline in the US and Europe. We are blamed for violence and repression against other races, and non-whites like Hua Hsu gloat over the prospect of us disappearing, and yet the overwhelming majority of non-whites owe their very existence to white culture   &mdash;   mechanized agriculture, the market economy, and modern medicine   &mdash;   which touched off the third world population explosion. And wherever Euro Whites build prosperous nations or pleasant communities, non-whites quickly follow to take advantage and drive Euros into the minority. Why? Because of  our ridiculous over generosity, I would say.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what all people of European ancestry loathe, and fear, is the likelihood of cognitively challenged races (blacks, hispanics, &amp; middle easterners) and creatively challenged ones (asians) limiting our freedoms, opportunities, and resources through crass tribalist politics, violent racism, and Islam. The day may come when we will need to globally disengage and build  a New European America.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, the superiority of Asian and all other cultures over that of America and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Chinese and Indian Immigrants Import Anti-Daughter Diversity<br>
 <br>
Throughout Asia and the Middle East, sons are valued, while daughters are often unwanted. Baby girls may be killed, thrown in the trash (as commonly occurs in China) or aborted as a result of prenatal scanning  &mdash;  a medical technology that was developed to improve the health of mother and child.</p>
<p>India made sex-selection abortion illegal a decade ago, to little effect. The estimates of missing females there range from 10 million over 20 years to a total of 50 million. China&rsquo;s 2000 census found 19 million more boys than girls in the under-15 cohort. </p>
<p>Social pathology has followed this imbalance as some desperate bachelors have turned to kidnapping to procure a wife: Chinese police freed more than 42,000 kidnapped women and children in 2001 and 2002. Tens of millions of unattached young men in Red China may spark social unrest of various kinds. Emigration is another strategy of men determined to get married.</p>
<p>Speaking of Asian immigrants, do newcomers from those socially retrograde countries retain their cultural misogyny when they relocate to egalitarian America? Absolutely. A recent study has shown that among some Asians, having mere daughters is simply unacceptable: It&rsquo;s a boy! Asian immigrants use medical technology to satisfy age-old desire: a son [San Jose Mercury, Jan 7, 2009].</p>
<p>Researchers are finding the first evidence that some Asian immigrant families are using U.S. medical technology to have sons instead of daughters, apparently acting on an age-old cultural prejudice that has led to high ratios of boys to girls in parts of China and India.</p>
<p>The new research, produced by independent teams of economists who arrived at similar conclusions, focused on Indian, Chinese and Korean families who first had girls and then used modern technology to have a son.</p>
<p>With birth records in Santa Clara County showing that Asian mothers are more likely to give birth to sons than white or Latino mothers are, the new data could reawaken a local controversy. Some local South Asian women have pressured local Indo-American newspapers and magazines in recent years to stop running ads for medical procedures that offer prospective parents the promise of a son.</p>
<p>For some South Asian couples, having a boy is a &ldquo;status symbol,&rdquo; said Deepka Lalwani of Milpitas, the founder and president of Indian Business &amp; Professional Women, a nonprofit business support network. &ldquo;If a woman has male children, she feels in her family, certainly with her in-laws, that her status will go up because now she is the mother of a male child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such cultural pressures may explain the recent findings. A Columbia University study suggests that Chinese, Indian and Korean immigrants have been using medical technology, most likely including abortion, to assure their later children were boys. And a soon-to-be published analysis of birth records by a University of Texas economist estimates there were 2,000 &ldquo;missing girls&rdquo; between 1991 and 2004 among immigrant families from China and India living in the U.S.  &mdash;  children never born because their parents chose to have sons instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing girls&rdquo; in America  &mdash;  another symptom of diverse immigration!</p>
<p>After a century of progress in the area of women&rsquo;s equality in the West, welcoming immigrants from misogynist cultures may well reverse that trend.</p>

China&rsquo;s unwanted girls<br>
 <br>
Boys are considered much more useful than girls</p>
<p>By Adam Brookes in Beijing <br>
On the garbage dumps that surround Beijing, scavengers from time to time will find a newborn baby girl amid the stinking refuge. </p>
<p>Sometimes she is still alive.  <br>
 <br>
Chen Rong makes her living from scavenging garbage, and over the years she has found five little girls on the tips. </p>
<p>She brought them all home to her one-room brick shack and she and her husband try to give them a chance. </p>
<p>In China, couples are permitted one, at most two, children. Too frequently a girl is a disappointment. </p>
<p>Thrown away <br>
Every year, say researchers, perhaps a million girl foetuses are aborted and tens of thousands of girl babies are abandoned. </p>
<p>Chen Rong is bringing up five abandoned girls<br>
 <br>
&#8220;One baby died before we even got her home,&#8221; says Mrs Chen. &#8220;Another garbage scavenger had taken her clothes and then left her to die. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was the only one who would pick her up. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see her die. </p>
<p>&#8220;Parents shouldn&rsquo;t throw away their children. This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&#8221; </p>
<p>But Chinese society is throwing away its little girls at an astounding rate. For every 100 girls registered at birth, there are now 118 little boys - in other words, nearly one seventh of Chinese girl babies are going missing. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some of those girls are alive, they are just not registered,&#8221; says Professor Zhai Zhenwu, of Beijing&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s University. &#8220;Some are abandoned, but many are aborted when the parents find out the foetus is a girl. </p>
<p>Professor Zhai Zhenwu: Big problem for China <br>
&#8220;This is a huge problem for China. We already have about 20 million boys who will never be able to marry because there aren&rsquo;t enough women. </p>
<p>&#8220;That number rises by 1.5 million every year. </p>
<p>&#8220;It will bring crime and prostitution. It will destabilise China.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jhiu Hongying is 19 and pregnant. The pressure on her to produce a boy is huge. Family and community demand it. A boy will bring status. He will continue the family line. </p>
<p>&#8220;Boys are the best, because they can work,&#8221; says the girl&rsquo;s mother, Zhang Hongying. &#8220;They&rsquo;re stronger. </p>
<p>&#8220;If my daughter has a son, everyone will celebrate. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the neighbours want her child to be a boy.&#8221; </p>
<p>At a Beijing temple, women come to pray that the foetus in their womb is that of a boy. Chinese tradition despises the girl child. This powerful cultural preference for sons is heightened by the one-child policy. </p>
<p>The result - millions of nameless baby girls in China are simply disappearing. </p>

		<p>Whenever the word &#8220;whiteness&#8221; is used in an essay such as this one, you know you are dealing with another fatuous leftard liberal stuck in a 1960s mindset. The tactic here is to reduce people of Euro-American descent to an abstraction (whiteness), then to belittle, mock, and dehumanize. White as a term merely means a person of European Christian origin. Nothing more, nothing less. Prolix 60s radical academics go on to write Talmudic volumes on the subject of &#8220;whiteness&#8221;, confusing semantics with reality, as is the case with all of the &#8220;whiteness studies&#8221; racket so common in academia today. </p>
<p>In this worldview, &#8220;whiteness&#8221; is emptiness, nothingness, antisceptic, emotionally repressed, sheltered, privileged, soulless, suburban, and clueless. Conversely, &#8220;people of color&#8221; are thought to be soulful, earthy, exotic, hip, aware, streetwise, long-suffering, authentic, vibrant, righteous, etc., etc., etc. This is a counterculture worldview of soft overprivileged (mostly) white youth whose own backgrounds personify the very &#8220;whiteness&#8221; they despise. The white privilege they constantly yap about is anxiety about their own social class privilege. </p>

		<p>To Walter Lewkowski:</p>
<p>I agree with all of your moral and political positions  &mdash;  ALL of them!</p>
<p>However, I feel that a conservative Pagan can hold these positions with just as much fervor as a Christian. Indeed, I believe that the original European Pagans (particularly the Germanics) held such positions, especially on chastity, conjugal faithfulness, and family authority.</p>
<p>I recommended the Alain deBenoist article in Occidental Quarterly because it makes clear the relationship between Christianity and Liberalism. I also recommend his book, On Being A Pagan.   </p>
<p>Sadly, it seems to me that Catholics and Lutherans are doing much to bring non-Whites into America; not only to bring them here, but to house them and try to initiate them into an advanced society.  There have been several articles about this very subject on the AR website. So I cannot share your enthusiasm for the Mother Church.</p>
<p>I believe that the first institution of Christian culture to crumble was the Bible, or rather, the literalist interpretation of the Bible. To date, no evidence has been found for any plagues on Egyptians, a massive Exodus of Hebrews from Egypt, the rotation of the world stopping so that Canaanites could be slain in extended daylight, the existence of a literal King David, or even Solomon, and even the passage by Josephus about Jesus is considered forged at worst and added-to at best. Also, there are no historical records of earthquakes and darkness at the crucifixion. These facts have been known for at least two-hundred years. And even before that, textural &#8220;higher&#8221; criticism revealed many difficulties with the biblical texts.</p>
<p>I agree with you that &#8220;a religious culture is necessary for almost every one.&#8221; But, for me, that religious culture is increasingly NOT Christian, as it once was.  The Christian gestalt  is sadly lacking. It has apparently abandoned the very people, namely the Europeans, who took it from the Roman underworld and made it into a force for beauty, scholarship, and spiritual aspiration.</p>
<p>It has made big promises, and not delivered, either personally or nationally.</p>
<p>This made me sad, at first, and then rather angry.</p>

		<p>It might sound implausible, but this country is not going to last long enough for the likes of the worse than sophomoric Mr. Hsu and his ilk to take over. Or more correctly, be sitting in all the fake seats of power working for those who really run the show. </p>
<p>The country is already far closer to complete collapse than most believe or understand. America is not immune to collapsing in on itself. People who think that a total meltdown or &#8220;anti-white&#8221; attack on our race by all the non-whites in the US would spell the end should pause and realistically consider all of the scenarios. For example, things tank, and we get this; 40% White population vs 60% non-white population in a showdown, no holds barred. Do you really think the blacks, latinos and asians could align themselves together, along with their string pullers, to give it to Whitey if everything goes down the tubes? Not for long, not for long. </p>
<p>I suspect part of the aim of Mr. Hsu&rsquo;s mediocre piece is simple brainwashing, hoping to make Whites give up. &#8220;Back off, don&rsquo;t fight us.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t stop the rigged game all non-whites and certain elites enjoy. All I get from &#8220;minority&#8221; clods like Hsu is a feeling of fear. Their fear. Their fear that Whites are going to blow-up after being pushed into a corner and ruin the easy time these interlopers have enjoyed for over 40 years.</p>
<p>Having done some work with the IW Group, I can tell you they are more interested in their poorly designed MacDonald&rsquo;s advertisements geared at Asian immigrants than at anything else. </p>

<p>Pretentious and intellectually insecure&hellip;? What does Hua Hsu know about a real Harvard Graduate in 1920? Hua Hsu would be a better writer if he stuck to the advice of Kwai Chang Caine&rsquo;s mentor at the old Shaolin temple, Master Kan, and wrote about, &#8220;what one knows to be certain&#8221; instead of this, uhmmm, drivel. In fact, I would invite Mr Hsu to go back and take some lessons there. After all China is busy asserting itself as one of the premier societies of the 21st Century. They could use the help.</p>

     Absolutely.  That&rsquo;s what being a schoolteacher is all about.  As it now stands, redneck culture is useful to our race mainly as an identifier, a flag if you will, that marks White territory, just as hip hop and graffitti mark non-White territory.  It&rsquo;s a sad, tattered banner, for a people marginalized in their own land.  Even worse, Nashville is owned by Hollywood, and C&W; is as subject to leftist censorship as any Ivy League college paper.  Where are the hit songs about losing jobs to foreigners, or Black crimes against Whites?  Why isn&rsquo;t &#8220;The Wichita Massacre&#8221; or some such title #1 on the country charts?  Yes, redneck culture is a pathetic remnant of a once vibrant folk culture, but it&rsquo;s still ours, and we shouldn&rsquo;t scorn it. <br>
      There is a danger in bringing higher culture to the White masses, the likelihood that those bright kids who come to like Bach will adopt the snobbery of the elite and come to despise their own.  Contempt for ordinary Whites is the price of admission to the sophisticated life.  I know several PhDs from working class or farm backgrounds who despise their roots, and are ardent multiculturalists.  Their cultural tolerance extends to every primitive on the planet, except honest Whites with dirt on their hands.  I&rsquo;d rather a White kid remain ignorant of higher White culture than become an enemy of his race. </p>

		<p>America is dying, that much is plain. Moreover, it will never come back - not when 40% (and rising) of the population can never be American, for the simple reason that they are not genetically similar to the Founding Fathers (for simpletons: they aren&rsquo;t white). I say good riddance!</p>
<p>America has, at least in the twentieth century, but really since 1861 (and maybe 1776), been predominantly a force for mostly unintentional evil in the Occidental world. Our idiotic intervention in WW1 secured the Bolshevik victory, the Hohenzollern defeat, and the Versailles Treaty, which led directly to Hitler and WW2, the gotterdamerung of Europe, which in turn led directly to the retreat of the colonial powers, as well as the granting of moral supremacy to leftist Jews, followed by the now-sacred &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement and the mindless but suicidal &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; of today, whereby one is considered somehow immoral for pointing out that non-whites have no right to occupy European soil, that Americans can restrict immigration to whomever we choose, and ought to do so, favoring our fellow whites, and for even daring to espouse the basic biological perpetuity of the white race. America also imposed racial minorities onto European peoples, especially the<br>
 Germans, a crime of unforgivable proportions.</p>
<p>The liberal historian and public intellectual Tony Judt has said that at the beginning of the twentieth century it was not clear if it would turn out to be an American (ie, &#8220;free&#8221; and democratic) or German (ie, authoritarian, hierarchical, white supremacist) Century. We know how it unfolded. Does any serious conservative anymore not wish that this HAD been a German-dominated epoch (most would prefer the Kaiser to Hitler, but either victorious would have perpetuated and strengthened the global rule of the white man - not led us to the brink of the abyss, as &#8220;democrats&#8221; and their &#8220;conservative&#8221; non-opposition have)? </p>
<p>America is dead. I think we can all agree on that. What matters is not our nation, but our race. Indeed, let every white man &#8220;say it loud and proud&#8221;: MY RACE IS MY NATION NOW.</p>
<p>The only question men of the Right now face is, how should we best proceed in order to rally whites everywhere around our common Racial Principle - the West&rsquo;s ONLY hope for renewal and even bare survival?</p>

		<p>We often think that blacks who grumble about the evils of white people should just for one day live without all the benefits that white people have brought to their world.  I think that those who grumble about Christianity and the Catholic Church in particular, should just for one day try to live without all the material and spiritual benefits that Christianity has brought to the world.</p>
<p>Some would have us believe that there is a war between Catholic Church and those who hold that the white race should remain the white race.  Since the notion that the white race is distinct and deserves to be preserved is felt to be at odds with the Christian doctrine that all men are God&rsquo;s children, many race realists conclude that Christianity is at odds with the desire to keep America a white country.  But the Church has never held that a Spaniard is entitled to live in England because of his brotherhood in Christ.  No one is entitled to live in some one else&rsquo;s country.  An African native is my brother in Christ, but he is not entitled to live in America.   </p>
<p>Catholic Bishops and priests are not doing the work of the Lord by bringing in non-Europeans to America.  Multiculturalism is a disordering of society. It runs counter to Logos. There is no doubt about that.  </p>
<p>The Bishops&rsquo; motive for bringing Third Worlders into America is their desire to be accepted by the elite.  Bishops and Cardinals live in luxury.  They are like Supreme Court Justices; once they&rsquo;re in they forget about us.  Christ commanded his disciples, &ldquo;Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; Matt28-19.  He did not say bring all to Jerusalem.  By not going to the nations and converting the people, the Bishops go against Christ will. </p>
<p><br>
I had one parish priest who wanted to make our parish into a sanctuary for communist&rsquo;s rebels.  I called Reagan&rsquo;s head of Immigration and he came to our church and soundly defeated our pastor in the debate and ended the threat of invasion of our church.  Our parish was middle class, living in the de facto segregated Westside of Cleveland; a beautiful peaceful neighborhood.  It was evident by his sermons that he disliked us and our comfortable lives. </p>
<p>Many American Bishops are resentful of us just like that pastor.  They are to a great extend anti-white middle class.  Along with their animosity for us they also are friendly to the Church&rsquo;s enemies, feminists, homosexuals, equalitarians, and revolutionaries.  No Bishop Sheen&rsquo;s among them.  Same for most Catholic universities.  We are in hard times.</p>
<p>The anti-white Church hierarchy seem to labor under the same mistaken impression that Mr. Whiteplight does, &ldquo;Nearly every advance in Science and Art was done under duress and often secretly (from the Church) until it could no longer supress the inherent European intellect. Greece and Rome with their historians and philosophers contributed much more to Western Civilizaiton than this Middle Eastern transplant&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of the truth.  The fundamental doctrine of the Catholic Church is that Christ is Logos and as such Christ communicates the logic and reason that runs through the universe.  This means that the world is understandable and contradictions cannot exist.  This belief in the attainability of truth impelled the Churchmen to investigate the universe.  That is why many advances in science were done by Catholic and Christian scientists in Catholic and Christian universities.  </p>
<p>There are some of the race realists who study thoroughly the question of race, but who have not brought the same rigorous thought to bare on their study of religion and Christianity.  They are satisfied with the simplistic explanation of the anti-white, anti-Christian government schools.  Worshipping the cross is idolatry.</p>
<p>European wars were mainly between princes and kings trying to enrich themselves.  The Christian battles were less numerous than their pagan ancestors&rsquo; interminable battles, and a good deal more humane.  The big killing of whites, WWI &amp; WWII, the Popes tried mightily to stop.  The American white people of the North attacked the American white people of the South, and pagan Abe Lincoln led the assault. </p>
<p>The line of allegiance is God, family, extended family, then country.  The more the country is unlike the extended family the less allegiance.   The Christians drove the Moors from Spain in 1492, saved Europe from the Turks in 1571 at the Battle of Lepanto, again in 1683 under John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna.  Without Christianity there would be no white Europe, no extended family white race.  The attack on the white race today is an attack on Christianity first and foremost.  Unless you see this you will not see your true enemy, and you will lose all.   <br>

<p>The entire multicultual charade is a vehicle to transport resources from weak Whites to strong Whites. Minorities<br>

<p>The strongest Whites are not interested in cultural preservation. They are interested in accumulating more wealth.

<p>If you are in a pit with a tiger in a cage, and a man, outside the pit, pulls on a chain connected to the door, releasing the tiger upon you, is the tiger responsible for your predicament? Do you get pissed at the tiger for attacking you as it is obviously in its nature to? Or is the man responsible, for knowing the nature of a particular arrangement of matter, the tiger, and wielding it as effectively as someone else, understanding another particular arrangement of matter, the firearm, might wield that?</p>
<p>I remember reading on a less appropriate site a poster referring to blacks as &#8220;black biological weapons,&#8221; and that is correct. They don&rsquo;t destroy suddenly with a bang, like bombs, but what fool would consider sudden destruction the only type to mind? Whether a city be carpet bombed in a day or gutted over a fifty year span by creatures of a specific behavior directed appropriately, the result is a fled, ruined city unfit for worthwhile life.</p>
<p>And it is, as mister 10:30 says, the elite Whites who are using such biological weapons on us, and it is, as most everybody has mentioned, the unthinking lower Whites who enable them.</p>
<p>And about them, those enabling Whites, I don&rsquo;t know precisely where I should draw the line between not caring about them in themselves, and considering that they might convert if reasonably exposed, but I am fairly confident that there is a large body of them that are going to get a good screwing undeserving of shedding tears over.</p>

<p>Deny, if you can that the RLC was at the core of Europes&rsquo; hundreds of years of civil conflict, many wars and ultimately the monarchies that tormented Europe with the Church&rsquo;s endorsement (many lords were in fact RLC bishops (in the Holy Roman Empire and Habsburg Empire).  These backward and reactionary autocracracies led to the rise of Marxism, the rise of Islam (seen as a reaction to Christianity) and the trigger for the great European civil wars that in the 20th century destroyed Europe and destroyed much of the European, White gene pool.  What we have today in Europe is a emasculated set of nations giving themselves up to the most agressive invaders of all time.  They simply cannot face any more war, they have &#8220;painted themselves into a corner&#8221; spiritually and philosophically.  Pretending an innocent role for Christianity simply flies in the face of all well known historical records.</p>

Islamist don&rsquo;t use it, they even have more wives to make more babies. Only the White Man limits his numbers painlessly.</p>
<p>And so ends his line, painlessly.</p>

		<p>Mr. Hua Hsu has no problem with blacks, hispanics, asians, etc. increasing their share of the US population and thus eroding the dominance of whites and their culture in america. I really wonder is Mr. Hua Hsu native China will, when it eventually becomes a fully industialized counrty like ours, allow other races (like say, whites, blacks, middle easteners, south asians) to settle there and cause East Asian Orientals to loose their majority status!? I wouldn&rsquo;t bank on it, given how restrictive immigration laws are in neighboring Japan and South Korea. Some one should corner Mr Hua Hsu and ask him why america must be expected to take in people from all over the planet when his native China (and its neighbors) refuse to do the same. WHY THE DOUBLE STANDARDS MR. HSU!!??</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I remember reading on a less appropriate site a poster referring to blacks as &ldquo;black biological weapons,&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do you mean by a &#8220;less appropriate site&#8221;? The tragedy of the pro-White movement is that some White organizations always like to present themselves as being more &#8220;respectable&#8221; than other pro-White groups. One pro-White thinker once remarked that &#8220;most right-wing White men often spit at the man to their right&#8221;. There is a desire by &#8220;respectable&#8221; right-wing whites, to distance themselves from &#8220;extremists&#8221;.</p>
<p>When are pro-White organizations going to agree to respectfully disagree on the issues that divide them, and respect each other as working towards a common goal? </p>

<p>Pro white groups need to clean up their act. It&rsquo;s true, or it&rsquo;s arguable, that there&rsquo;s a place for all beliefs in the cause. But just who might the respectable pro-white groups be? AmRen? Haha. First and foremost white power groups need to clean up their act. That will never happen because pro-white groups are run by informants, observers and those set out to embarrass white people. Or at best overlords attempting to condescend or pretend to be in empathy with the white rank and file.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the act is number one. It&rsquo;s not that they are so evil, or bigoted or even too extreme. The problem is, for the most part, they are just so dumb. That&rsquo;s pretty ironic coming from the very one&rsquo;s who often claim whites are so terrible smart. <br>

<p>I guess when radical Christians who say that non-believers are the real enemy.  </p>
<p>As I wrote earlier above, I have no problem with those Whites who still choose to be Christians or adhere to whatever it is that makes them comfortable.  But the tendency there is to wish to go back and that is not going to happen.  We never go back, but on.  I think that it is valid to debate these issues as I am completely confident in my own case and its proofs.  But I will not reject anyone who just can&rsquo;t grasp it.  As I already wrote above, I actually agree that most people need a community structure that religion provides.  I do see the psychological traps in it also and how non-productive over reliance on dogma becomes and that it always causes a reaction.  So I would like to see a White community that is perhaps more philosophical and tolerant of itself than a Hitler like adherence to pseudo-science and hodge-podge schizoid combinations of Christianity and the Occult for example.  That is probably hoping for too much.  So I would, like you, like to see some Whites relent a bit on their pre-requisite check-lists, such as the one Mr. Lebowski presented in this posting session.</p>

<p>That claim is absurd, and is seldom made here.  The &#8220;terrible (you meant terribly?) smart are from the far right tail of the bell curve.</p>

<p>I wish to again state that I am in sympathy with your political and moral adherences. </p>
<p>My own adherence to truth required that I leave Christianity.</p>
<p>Many times I had what I call the &#8220;spiritual shell game&#8221; played on me. I would become disillusioned with some form of Christianity, and someone would say, &#8220;Well, that is not the real Christianity. This one is.&#8221; And I would lift up the shell, and, behold, the Pearl of Great Price was not there. And then someone else would pull the same thing, and I would lift up the shell, and, etc. etc. I never found that Pearl.</p>
<p>So much time reading and investigating, looking for what surely must be there, because God is true to His promises!</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Communists.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Comrade, of course we are starving today. Comrade X represents the REAL communism, and once he is in power, the Workers&rsquo; Paradise will be achieved!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Comrade X was a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>So, someone else comes along and says, &#8220;But, Comrade, Comrade Y is the true exemplar of communist principles! Once he is in power, etc. etc.&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, Comrade Y did no such thing.</p>
<p>Christianity and communism are, to me, eerily similar. Both promise that, if the true version is followed, then  paradise, <br>
miracles, healings, decency, just wages, peace, etc. will follow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the &#8220;true version&#8221; is always just out of reach!  </p>
<p>Enough is enough, for Russians (seduced by communism) and<br>
Europeans (seduced by Christianity). Both these illusions demand sacrifice in return for glib promises. </p>
<p>Let a moral, race-conscious Paganism arise from the ashes of both.     </p>

  This article was terrible &#8216;hit piece&rsquo; on White culture and society. Hsu asks what can stop the decline of White people and give them their own cultural identity. Well, I think the answer is to challenge multi-cultural fascism where it it&rsquo;s most active and damaging: our education system and our media. White American culture stems from European Western culture and this, to the eternal envy of people like Hsu, is what built and founded America., Up until the Sixties whites had no problem identifying with their own culture. But because of the left-wing biases and indoctrinations of our university campuses, which are echoed in the media, most whites feel brow beaten and ashamed of who they are.   </p>
<p>  If I were King for a day, I would poop-can all the sociology departments (Michelle Obama was sociology major,BTW) that &#8216;teach&rsquo; American history and heritage is racist and therefore illegitimate and replace them with Western civilization departments that teach Latin, ancient Greek and the history, art and philosophy of Western thinkers. Future students of all colors would benefit not only from learning a real discipline like Latin, but would have to accept that this is America&rsquo;s true cultural identity. People like P-diddy, whom Hsu seems to have a not so secret crush on, would be then rejected and seen for what they are: shallow, narcissistic posers that like the rest of hip-hop culture, has little of any worth to offer anyone.</p>

  For anyone who&rsquo;s interested in how Hwu Hsu got the nerve to write such a provocative and insulting diatribe or how we got to this point, go look up the Hart-Celler Act of 1965. This piece of immigration legislation, that was heavily sponsored by champion swimmer Ted Kennedy, has effectively destroyed the White identity of this nation. </p>

		<p>I happened upon this site by accident while looking for responses to the ridiculous article written by Mr. Hsu.  Just for some anecdotal evidence to the contrary, diversity is not &#8220;prized above all else&#8221; by the majority of young whites.  At all.  We see the blatant hypocracy in the attempt to celebrate the ethnicity of others but then are conversly asked to be ashamed of our own.  <br>
I live in Texas and my mostly white neighborhood is filled with pricey cars with Obama bumper stickers displayed proudly.  However, if you look at where the drivers of those cars chose to live, and who they chose to marry and bear children with, it is evident that diversity is not a sincere value of theirs.  <br>
I happen to think that the decline of whites began in the late 70&rsquo;s early 80&rsquo;s when white men decided that they could divorce their wives and abandon their children with no repurcussions, social or otherwise.  That has done more to squelch the white birthrate than anything else&hellip;.young white girls seeing their mothers stuck with children and no resources.  But I digress&hellip;</p>

		<p>Motherof3, I believe you are on to something here, that could be investigated and reported on, in more detail. Rereading the above article, made me consider the factors played by divorce of white baby-boomers at just about the times you mentioned. There was practically and epidemic. Good luck to you and yours.</p>

		<p>Mr. Hsu (the poor guy) doesn&rsquo;t get SWPL.  It&rsquo;s not that &#8220;whiteness has become a vacuum&#8221;; it&rsquo;s that Marxist-inspired multiculturalism and radical egalitarianism has taken over both the universities and mass media (one thing leading directly to the other) and finally produced a huge cohort of brain-washed young white people.  And not just any cohort: they&rsquo;re represented by the most intelligent, educated and affluent members of the U.S. white population (worse yet, the replacement white population).</p>
<p>I could go into greater detail, but I have an actual job I&rsquo;ve got to get to, so I refer interested parties to an article at spiked-online: &#8220;The definitive guide to white people&#8221; (https://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/printable/6112/):</p>
<blockquote>&lsquo;It amazed me when I looked around and saw the reaction of all these people who considered themselves open-minded&hellip; They all thought the exact same way and I wanted to tell them &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not open-minded, you&rsquo;re progressive and there&rsquo;s a difference&rdquo;. The same people would assume that every single conservative point of view was wrong and evil. I&rsquo;m not a conservative by any means, but I see value in discourse and actually listening to the other side, whether they&rsquo;re wrong or right. But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen at all. They were as intolerant as the people they hated.&rsquo;</blockquote>
<p>Too bad The Atlantic doesn&rsquo;t allow reader comments to articles, assuming the editors would allow anything even vaguely heterodox to be uttered.</p>
