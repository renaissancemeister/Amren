			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hector Tobar, Los Angeles Times, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wise American once wrote, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t go home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles, you know that truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>Call this city home, and eventually L.A. will repay your devotion with a swift kick, a cold slap, and a mocking wave goodbye.</p>
<p>I learned this lesson the hard way after many years away. I decided to revisit the corner of L.A. where I was born and raised.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I called this place Hollywood. The glitzier meanings of the name barely registered in my young brain. The Hollywood I knew was a sooty playground of concrete and asphalt where all my friends lived.</p>
<p>Then I got older, and moved to Montebello and many other places in California and beyond. I started telling people I was born in East Hollywood. I liked the gritty feel &#8220;East&#8221; added to its name.</p>
<p>But on my recent return, I found my old homeplace had a new name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Armenia&#8221; read the bold white letters on blue rectangular signs, installed by city workers on Hollywood Boulevard. Unfortunately, I am not Armenian.</p>
<p>Returning to your childhood home and finding it officially named for another ethnic group is sort of like going to your birthday party and finding someone else&rsquo;s name on the cake.</p>
<p>If the sign had read &#8220;Little Guatemala,&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure I would have felt a burst of pride: I might have called my immigrant mother to say, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a little part of L.A. named after us!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>My parents came here from Guatemala to reinvent themselves. Tens of thousands of Guatemalans followed after them, changing the L.A. neighborhoods they lived in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Little Tokyo, we read in this paper Saturday, is filling with Koreans. There&rsquo;s been a big Vietnamese and Cambodian presence in Chinatown for decades now. And my part of East Hollywood probably could just as easily be called Little Manila or Little San Salvador.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying the Armenian imprint on my old stomping grounds.</p>
<p>Armenian business owners have populated the neighborhood with signs written in the loops and arcs of their alphabet. My inability to speak Armenian led to a short conversation with a local merchant that ended with him apologizing for his poor English.</p>
<p>{snip} A lot of Guatemalans still live there. And another corner of our old stomping grounds has another official city of Los Angeles neighborhood designation: Thai Town.</p>
<p>It was the Thais who beat us all to the punch, back in 1999.</p>
<p>The Thais even got Caltrans to put &#8220;Thai Town&#8221; signs on the Hollywood Freeway.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the official designation of Thai Town irked an Armenian sensibility or two. So in 2000, the City Council renamed part of East Hollywood to honor &#8220;the traditional birthplace of the Armenian community of Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official boundaries of Thai Town and Little Armenia overlap, which is odd  &mdash;  but also entirely appropriate, given the patchwork of ethnicities that call the place home.</p>

			<p>A multicultural country isn&rsquo;t a country at all.  It&rsquo;s no more than a staging area for economic refugees whose true allegiances are with the failed state they fled from, because they couldn&rsquo;t make a living there.  Most of them also are rife with corruption and amount to no more than open sewers, yet that doesn&rsquo;t seem to deter the relocated rabble from flying their rags anywhere they can to show their loyalty, making it more than obvious where their hearts really lie.</p>
<p>The multicults idea of a rainbow utopia, expecting everybody to get along would be a laughing matter if it wasn&rsquo;t going to result in internecine warfare.  And make no mistake about it, that&rsquo;s exactly where it&rsquo;s headed.</p>

			<p>In a departure from the past, special interest groups now plant their flags on their urban claims, which lends permanency to their land-grab.  </p>
<p>Once you put up permanent markers, you have something to rally around and defend as a primal instinct.  Call it the unwelcome mat for outsiders.</p>
<p>It is ultimately about politics.  The community which is bonded together around a neighborhood can demand concessions from elected representatives, who must court them at election time.  </p>
<p>It also facilitates criminals, who can operate in a closed environment, behind a language and cultural barrier, often hostile to police forces.</p>

			<p>Wow - a white immigrant group pushing out non-whites. Who knew they still let white immigrants into the U.S.? Irish, Russians and Armenians seem to be the only white immigrants allowed in any big numbers.</p>

			<p>Armenians, like all peoples from the Middle East, practice in-group morality.  That is, they will lie to you and cheat you.  But they are very conscious of being White, and will call their businesses Euro this or Euro that.  </p>

			<p>Armenian communities have been around California for over a hundred years, long before the Guatemalans ever started showing up.  And the fact that they&rsquo;ve displaced Guatemalans in this L.A. neighborhood should only be seen as a positive step forward.  </p>
<p>Armenians are by and large, Christian, originally Caucasian, hardworking, intelligent people, and they will assimilate a lot faster than the Guatemalans ever did.  In another generation, you will see most of those Armenian signs disappear, the neighborhood will prosper, and you will barely know that it was ever an &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; neighborhood back at the turn of the 21st century.</p>

			<p>I grew up and went to school with Armenian guys and girls at a time when they were just Americans to me and my friends. We went to the beach, we played baseball, the Armenian girls hung out with other girls and there were no &#8220;little Armenias&#8221; that I knew of. Yes, liberal/progressives, it&rsquo;s true and was always true, before you started your programs to divide and balkanize people and allow millions of unassimiliated people into the U.S., you troublers of America.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;immigrant&#8221; who wrote this piece must not be very old. That neighborhood was 100% white through 1971 or so. Then Immigration Act of 1965 really took hold. While there are a lot of Armenians in the neighborhood, they were able to have the area named &#8220;Little Armenia&#8221; through organization, political clout. Their population in the area is dwarfed, surrounded, by third world illegals from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador. I know all this because I grew up in the same neighborhood. There was a small black neighborhood just East of this area and it has disappeared completely. But crime is higher than ever. The true &#8220;Little Armenia&#8221; is Glendale, a few miles Northeast. Their favored immigration status coupled with daisy-chain immigration via the Act of &#8216;65 has seen them take over that city top to bottom. All thanks to Emanuel Celler, Jacob Javitz and the sponsorship of Ted Kennedy. As to this Guatemalan who penned this article, you can bet that his parents are most likely illegals.  His current home city of Montebello has been destroyed by the latino invasion. </p>

<p>These Armenians are also the most organized and ruthless criminals in the U.S. They don&rsquo;t do the blatant, obvious crimes the stupid Guatamalans do, they are much more covert.</p>

I also have personal experience with the areas under discussion here, and can vouch for what Posted by From East Hollywood at 9:31 PM on January 27 said about historical pop&rsquo;n trends and ethnic shifts. </p>
<p>And as a different poster said, Armenians are white, Christian, and they assimilate. The mestizos like the author of this article are not white, their Christianity retains pre-columbian remnants, and the only assimilation they have in mind is making us anglos assimilate to them (Reconquista, Aztlan, etc). </p>
<p>The other concentration of Armenians in LA, as has also been pointed out, is in the suburb of Glendale. Unlike the sprawling swaths of dirty, depressing, dangerous hispanic neighborhoods   &mdash;   which now that latinos are &gt;50% of the LA population constitute fully HALF of the neighborhoods in America&rsquo;s second-largest city   &mdash;    Armenian-heavy Glendale is a clean, orderly, SAFE place where anybody who reads this site would feel comfortable. </p>
<p>Although I have to say that I don&rsquo;t agree with this whole business of getting City Hall to officially name areas after ANY ethnic group. Putting up signs promoting a certain ethnic neighborhood adds the imprimatur of legitimacy to ethnic identity politics. It merely encourages competing ethnic agendas   &mdash;   and leads to annoying articles written by disgruntled meso-americanos in the LA Times. If it were up to me, no American city would spend even one taxpayer dime even for a &#8220;Chinatown&#8221; sign, let alone ones for &#8220;Little Tokyo,&#8221; &#8220;Little Armenia,&#8221; &#8220;Thai Town,&#8221; and all the rest. Such signs are an obvious disincentive to social cohesion, to assimilation, to AMERICANIZATION. </p>
<p>&#8220;Americanization.&#8221; Now THERE&rsquo;S a word you don&rsquo;t hear much anymore&hellip;</p>

			<p>Armenians are Middle Eastern, not European&hellip;and certainly nothing at all like Protestant Englishmen.  The United States is Protestant English to the core.  When that core is gone, the United States is gone.</p>

			<p>The Armenians of Bobby&rsquo;s youth and mine were the grandchildren of immigrants, they didn&rsquo;t even care about hating the Turks.  Those who have flooded Glendale are post Soviet, they grew up under communism and are very different from my school friends. They don&rsquo;t like Mexicans but they act like them.  </p>

<p>Ranger is right. So long as the trough is full, and every animal is getting its belly filled, things can remain (at least fairly) peaceful. But when the hard times come and the goodies dry up, that&rsquo;s when things will get nasty. Really nasty.<br>

Thank you E. Hollywood!   I was thinking the very same thing. He can&rsquo;t be very old, having such a limited view of history.  He thinks  (like most immigrants) that the USA came into being when he was born, and nothing existed there before.  It was an empty space.  I have to laugh at such a self-centered view.</p>
<p>I remember E. Hollywood from the 1950&rsquo;s.  I didn&rsquo;t live there but I had a friend who did and I often visited. (I don&rsquo;t remember it as the sooty, ugly place that he describes. Perhaps it became that way <i>after </i> his people moved in?)  In fact, I think that area had once been quite elegant - earlier in the century and during Hollywood&rsquo;s pre-Depression heyday - which was already before my time.   I remember spooky old mansions, probably long vanished now, which already looked old even to me. (Think of the movies &#8220;Sunset Boulevard&#8221; or &#8220;Baby Jane&#8221; - which may even have filmed there.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amusing that this fellow, a Guatemalan, is complaining that these other groups have taken over &#8220;his&#8221; neighborhood!  Back then, when I knew it, there were no Guatemalans anywhere to be seen.  I never met a Guatemalan, or heard of a Salvadoran.  Nor were there Thais, Koreans,  Cambodians, Vietnamese, etc., etc. (Only a few Japanese and Chinese, the only Orientals, not the vast variety you have today.) However, Armenians  had already been living there for about a century. </p>
<p> &#8220;His&#8221; neighborhood, indeed! </p>

			<p>Armenians are among the most racially conscious nations in the world. They always form their own communities wherever they live (Turkey, Europe or USA). Even after 1000 years, there are still Armenian neighborhoods in Istanbul. My former chief was Armenian, his children are attending Armenian school, they very rarely intermarry.<br>
Racially, they very slightly differ from Eastern Anatolian Turks and especially Kurds. Generally, only the religion separate people in Anatolia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Never call an Armenian or Turk &#8220;Middle Easterner&#8221;. They are just &#8220;Anatolians&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Several points about the Armenians need to be mentioned.</p>
<p>1) In spite of what several posters have written about Armenians, they are not White (European Caucasian).  They have never been White, and they&rsquo;ll never be White.  They are though, Caucasians (Europids).</p>
<p>2) Prof. Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen estimate the IQ of your avg. Armenian to be 94.  This would actually put them on par with several European ethnic groups.  It would also explain the fairly high level of civilization the Armenians achieved (compared to many of their neighbors) before they were conquered by the Arabs.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_Global_Inequality#National_IQ_and_economic_development" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_Global_Inequality#National_IQ_and_economic_development</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians#History" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians#History</a></p>
<p>3) While I have read a number of articles on the Armenian mafia, in all fairness to them they are neither the most vicious or the most powerful of the ethnic gangs operating in this country.  The most vicious is unquestionably &#8220;Mara Salvatrucha&#8221; or MS-13.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.citynews.ca/news/news_23489.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://www.citynews.ca/news/news_23489.aspx</a></p>
<p>The most powerful (in terms of wealth and reach) without a doubt is the &#8220;Russkaya Mafiya,&#8221; a loose confederation of Russian, Chechen and Russian-Jewish mobs that have amassed considerable influence worldwide since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Former FBI head Louis Freeh even once claimed they were the greatest threat to U.S. national security.</p>

<p>4) Armenians are not one people.  They are actually two peoples.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.springerlink.com/content/lhlll6l3txeyyc5h/" rel="nofollow">https://www.springerlink.com/content/lhlll6l3txeyyc5h/</a></p>
<p>5) Finally, rates of intermarriage between members of the Armenian Diaspora and members of their host countries (in the West, anyway) is about the same as with any other ethnic group.</p>

			<p>Conan the literate non-barbarian is partly right about the Irish connection. </p>
<p>One and only one of the Declaration of Independence signatories was a Catholic of Irish descent but a great many of the signatories were wholly or in part of Ulster-Scots descent, just as many later Presidents were of Ulster-Scots descent.</p>
<p>At the time of the War of Independence the population of the thirteen colonies was overwhelmingly of British Protestant descent. True, there were a few Swedes and Dutch, but not many. The Presidency of Martin van Buren lay in the future.</p>
<p>Check out the *vdare* site for a great deal on this topic. </p>
<p>Talking of ethnicities, what is truly astonishing is that a few Chinese fought in the U.S. Civil War.</p>

			<p>Armenians aren&rsquo;t so bad. They are Christians. In fact Armenia was the very first Christian kingdom in history. They are also traditionally very hostile to Islam and have historically (along with the Georgians) played a major &#8220;blocking&#8221; role in the Caucasus keeping Islam in check in that area of the world. Who can say how far northward into what is now Russia Islam might have penetrated without them? Likewise the much-misunderstood Serbs played an important role in the Balkans aginst muslim expansion. The Serbs (who regarded themselves as &#8220;the guardians of the gate&#8221;) took one for several centuries for the benefit of Europe.</p>

			<p>We Armenians are typically hardwoking, industrious, intelligent, good looking people.  We are not middle eastern (though my father was from Syria where our family settled after the Armenian holucaust).  Most of us are integrated Americans and consider ourselves Americans first.  Additionally, the greatest governor in California history was Armenian.  Get your facts straight before you post.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It would also explain the fairly high level of civilization the Armenians achieved (compared to many of their neighbors) before they were conquered by the Arabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Armenians were never &#8220;conquered by the Arabs&#8221;, nor were the Arabs even anywhere them.</p>

			<p>Armenians are not white. They are turks, but christian. They are more related to khazar jews than to white europeans. They are not considered white in Europe or Russia. I am not surprised that they are considered white in USA, because whiteness have been so devalued in your nation. Many &#8220;white&#8221; americans would be very surprised if someone told them that they would not be considered white in Europe. </p>
