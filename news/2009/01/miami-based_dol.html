<h1>Miami-Based Doll Has Hispanic Look and Immigrant Story</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elaine de Valle, Miami Herald, January 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Girls across the country are playing with a new doll that may look like one of the American Girl doll figures  &mdash;  but she&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Maru is similar to the New York-based icon  &mdash;  with trendy outfits, pets and a book about her life. But her story is closer to home for many South Florida girls: Maru is Hispanic.</p>
<p>She came to the United States alone to learn a new language, make new friends and live with her aunt and uncle until she is reunited with her parents, who are in another country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In that vein, the Maru and Friends line already has two other dolls  &mdash;  girls Maru meets at school. &#8220;They become BFFs,&#8221; Gutierrez [Maritza Gutierrez, creator of Maru] said. Jamie is blonde with blue eyes and freckles. Tanya is browner-skinned and has long curly brown hair.</p>
<p>All three were designed by award-winning artist Dianna Effner, better known for her one-of-a-kind collectible porcelain dolls. Each face has a different mold, Gutierrez said. And they have several outfits to choose from, including a jeans and espadrilles set, a coat and hat and pajamas. More outfits are in the works, as is a dog that Maru&rsquo;s aunt and uncle give her &#8220;to help ease her pain,&#8221; Gutierrez said.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda is an Asian-American doll and babies, a line called Happy Twins developed by a different award-winning designer. Quality is very important to Gutierrez, who has about 200 dolls in her own personal collection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans have American Girl. Now Latinas have Maru,&#8221; said Gutierrez, adding that there are some differences.</p>
<p>Maru and friends are less &#8220;bulky&#8221; than the AG line and they have one item of clothing their more famous predecessor doesn&rsquo;t have: underwear. It was something girls noticed at a recent toy fair where children were allowed to play with new toys as part of a market test.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gutierrez launched Maru and Friends on the Internet in October. In November, Maru was one of the gifts given to celebrities arriving for the 9th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. The dolls have already won the 2008 Greatest Products Award by iParenting Media.</p>
<p>And the website has already sold thousands of dolls at $110 a pop.</p>

			<p>Vdare.com has completely avoided taking on the cubans in miami.  You can&rsquo;t find a bigger indictment of post-1965  immigration policy than miami.For decades, the cubans down in miami have been driving Native Born White Americans further and further out of South Florida that is to say, further and further out of American territory. Miami is a foriegn country withn the borders of America. Vdare.com claims to to take on the National Question. Well Peter Brimelow, what about Miami?</p>
<p>Fact:Vdare.com finds Mexican flag waving troublesome as far the National Question goes. But what about cuban flag waving. Recently on vdare.com Joe Guzzardi said he had no problem with cubans in miami waving the cuban flag. Something is wrong with this picture. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Americans have American Girl. Now Latinas have Maru,&rdquo; said Gutierrez, adding that there are some differences.</p>
<p>How easy it is for non-European&rsquo;s to discriminate, So Latinas are not Americans now? Are they a separate nation who take just as much as they want or need from America, but retain their difference?.  I could care less if thats what they want to do, but I&rsquo;m agrieved because I know that if a White doll manufacturer tried to sell White dolls to appeal to Americans s/he&rsquo;d be subjected to a torrent of abuse and accusations of racism blah blah blah. <br>
I don&rsquo;t know much about dolls, but I did check out the American Girls website, there are plenty of white dolls but there&rsquo;s also Addy the runaway slave, Josefina the &#8220;New Mexican&rsquo;  Kaya the Nez Pierce and more, it&rsquo;s a veritable feast of Multicult. <br>
I really don&rsquo;t quite see the significance of this &#8216;Hispanic doll&rsquo; apart from trying to emphasise Hispanic difference, but in any case, the doll Maru is white. <br>

			<p>The doll sure looks like most other dolls, caucasian. The dark hair must be the secret to looking &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.  Maybe if the doll was pregnant it might look more &#8220;hispanic&#8221;, si?  Or, are there gang tatoos on the hands we can&rsquo;t see in the pic?</p>

			<p>Well, once again we see non-whites who can&rsquo;t come up with any ideas themselves copy the inventions of white people and then use those inventions for political reasons.</p>

			<p>This new book is not worthy of being called an &#8220;American Girl&#8221; book; this book is by Hispanics, for Hispanics, and should fall into oblivion shortly after release. <br>
When I&rsquo;m in a bookstore, even though all the multicult books are given bright, colorful displays, it&rsquo;s the classic children&rsquo;s literature that is purchased, and it&rsquo;s white parents who are doing the buying.</p>

<p>So what about that blonde haired blue eyed pale skinned buttermilk complted Barbie and Ken dolls.</p>
<p>Not a very valid point there sir.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with racial and ethnic dolls.  Ask your Mothers and Grandmothers about what were called &#8220;Storybook Dolls&#8221;</p>
<p>These were small dolls dressed in national costumes of different countries.  They were not to be played with but displayed.  The ideal was to have a collection of at least 20, all in different costumesdisplayed on decorative shelves.</p>
<p>This is nothing new.  There is nothing wrong with it. </p>
<p>It is a good way to assess the safety of a shopping mall.  Duck into a toy store and see how many black action figures and dolls are displayed.  The more black dolls you see, the more dangerous the parking lot and neighborhood.</p>

<p>I have a friend (he&rsquo;s Anglo/Irish/Czech) of mine whose wife (for reasons known only to her) surrounds herself with American Indian paraphenalia (she&rsquo;s Dutch/German, by the way).  She reveres them in spite of the fact none of them ever even invented the wheel.  </p>
<p>As her daughter was growing up, I feared her mother would inculcate her with this, so I took it upon myself to try to install racial consciousness in her.  At that time Mattel was selling a fabulous line of &#8220;Dolls of the World&#8221; Barbies.  Each year on her birthday I bought this girl a &#8220;European Princess&#8221; Barbie corresponding to a different branch of her ancestry.</p>
<p>Her mother was less than thrilled but held her tongue because the kid loved them!  Every time I came over I would point to one of the dolls and tell the girl stories about the great things her ancestors did.  The last doll I bought for her was &#8220;Viking Princess&#8221; Barbie.  Now the girl is in high school and is apparently cognizant of the fact she is radically different from her black and brown schoolmates.</p>
<p>I agree: there is nothing wrong with racial and ethnic dolls.  They can be an invaluable learning tool.</p>

  Rational thinker, <br>
My point was that this Hispanic woman can freely and confidently state that this doll is targeted at Latinas  because &#8220;Americans&#8221; have AG dolls, and  she can do this without being subjected to a torrent of Leftist hectoring about racism. Mattel&rsquo;s spokeswo/man does not and could not state that their Caucasian dolls are targeted at Caucasians only because (i) they&rsquo;re not, and (ii) can you hear the vitriol from the Multicultists already?<br>
 Anyone can buy a White (or Black/Brown/Asian) Barbie without feeling they are buying a doll that is meant only for another ethnicity.  My daughter &amp; her friends bought lots of different colored Barbies.<br>
Re Ken and Barbie, they are white because they were copies of a German doll Lilli, Ruth Handler bought one for her daughter Barbie, the family was White so they naturally made a doll that looked like them.<br>

			<p>Jupiter is absolutely wrong.  South Florida is much more than just Cubans.  There are foreign tribes there from everywhere.  In fact, I am hearing that many Cubans are leaving as other foreigners arive.  Since I don&rsquo;t live there, its just hard to judge what is going on down there.   Jupiter is correct that South Florida is no longer American but either is South Texas and much of the West Coast.</p>
