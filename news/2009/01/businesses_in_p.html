<h1>Businesses in Peru &#8216;Cannot Sack Drunk Workers&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>GAAP (London), January 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Businesses in Peru &#8216;cannot sack drunk workers&rsquo; A court in Peru has ordered that an employer reinstates a member of staff who was sacked for being drunk at work.</p>
<p>The highest court in the country was presiding over a case involving Pablo Cayo, a caretaker who was given the boot for being intoxicated at work.</p>
<p>Following the case, his former employer has been ordered to give him the job back, with one of the judges, Fernande Calle, saying his sacking was excessive has he carried out his role as normal and had not been violent or rude.</p>
<p>The court would not be revising the decision, he added.</p>
<p>Celso Becerra, the administrative chief of Lima suburb Chorrillos, denounced the ruling and told Sky News: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve fired four workers for showing up drunk, and two of them were drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we allow a drunk to work who might run somebody over?&#8221;</p>
<p>A separate court also recently ruled that a seaside district in Lima had dealt out a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; punishment after it fired a maid for drinking on the job in 2004.</p>
<p>It ordered that the maid was restored to her post, the Associated Press reported.<br/>

			<p>  One of George Orwell&rsquo;s most interesting books, and one which may be assumed was his «emancipation proclamation» agains the rigid, doctrinaire Left - wing ideology to which he addressed himself for many years,  was entitled : «My country Right or Left.» Perhaps in the fullness of time, we might have a bookf from an hitherto obscure Peruvian author. Perhaps entitled «My country, drunk or sober.» </p>
<p>  I also believe that it was Gladstone, who, commenting on the riotous drunkenness which still prevailed, particularly amongst the working classes within both urban and rural England («Gin Lane» etc.,), confessed that he «.  .  .preferred England free [drunk] to England sober.»</p>
<p>  I also believe that habitual, practically ritualistic intoxication, is not confined to the Peruvians; in parts of Mexico, too, this curious habitual intoxication also obtains amongst portions of the population. However, whereas the phenomenon in 19th century England was primarily class - based. In Mexico, and presumably in Peru,  I believe that it is primarily the mestizo (mixed race, indigenous or «métis»), who indulge in this curious past time. </p>

			<p>A colleague of mine (retired criminal defense attorney) worked a few summers in the late sixties in a General Motors engine block casting plant in the Detroit area. He intimated to me that there are a few Chevy 350 engine blocks out there with human teeth cast into them, mostly due to drunks and stoners falling from the catwalk into a crucible of molten iron. (instant vaporization)</p>
<p>The UAW had such a stranglehold on management that even when foremen discoverd drunks at work, they could only send them to the break room (with pay) until the shift ended or until they sobered up. So as a manufacturing juggernaut, I guess we can say that Detroit is rather like Peru.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s something personal here.  Someone should check and see if that Judge Calle is drunk on the job. (no kidding)</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.  I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing in Venezuela and Colombia, where it&rsquo;s standard, expected. It&rsquo;s a mark of &#8220;machismo&#8221;.<br/>
In other words, in the NORTHERN part of South America -  but not the (whiter) SOUTHERN part.</p>

<p>Fascinating.  I guess that explains a LOT of things about the Detroit auto industry!</p>
