			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), January 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inmates at Long Lartin prison said some were &#8220;becoming Muslim&#8221; because it is a &#8220;bigger gang&#8221;.</p>
<p>Radical cleric Abu Qatada, once described as Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s right-hand man in Europe, was held at the prison last year before being released on bail  &mdash;  which he went on to breach.</p>
<p>Similar concerns were raised in an inspection report in to Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire last year, in which prison officers warned extremist Muslim prisoners are ganging up on others in an attempt to radicalise them</p>
<p>Inspectors at Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, were told gang culture us widespread.</p>
<p>One inmate said: &#8220;Yes there is a gang culture here which is becoming an issue. A lot of people are becoming Muslim just because it&rsquo;s a bigger gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;There are issues with Muslim gangs wanting to overpower others.&#8221;</p>
<p>One added: &#8220;Muslim gangs; if you have a problem with one, you have a problem with them all,&#8221; while a fourth said: &#8220;People are converting to Islam for protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, for chief inspector Anne Owers, also found drug debts have led to violence among prisoners.</p>
<p>Inmates use phones to organise sales of class A drugs such as heroin, it said.</p>
<p>Phil Wheatley, director general of the National Offender Management Service, said: &#8220;The Governor and senior management team are committed to ensuring that all prisoners feel safe, and the strong personal officer scheme at Long Lartin continues to be developed to offer support to prisoners.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new programme to improve engagement, led by the Muslim Chaplain, will develop support specifically for Muslim prisoners. &#8220;<br>

			<p>So, the prison is becoming increasingly more Muslim just because it&rsquo;s the &#8220;in&#8221; thing in the joint, and the official response is to pander to it?</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that Islam in American prisons, largely a black thing, is mainly a prison thing.  I think that most black converts to Islam while in prison kinda drop it once they get out, or if they keep their Arabic names, they&rsquo;re trying to conceal their birth name, and conceal the rap sheets they earned with that name.</p>

			<p>What a convenient religion. There is no basis for conversion. (It must really be legit.) </p>
<p>I wonder what non-radical Muslims would think of this type of conversion. The Koran, read by radical and non-radical Muslims, says all should be converted to Islam or die. </p>
<p>???? I&rsquo;m at a loss for words. </p>

			<p>Finally, it takes the dregs of society to realize what all those high falutin&rsquo; college educated fools can&rsquo;t: that Islamics are just a &#8220;bigger gang.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s why Albanians who are more Slavic than not are Muslims they (especially their women) were forced to convert.</p>

Sharia in Action:</p>
<p>This is a link to a secular Turkish site that shows how an 8 year old Iranian boy whose only crime was to steal a loaf of bread from the local bazaar is being punished by the Iranian authorities.</p>

			<p>I did three years in the hoosgow here in the US, but there was no stampede of white inmates to convert to Islam, as far as I could discern.  The only white convert I met was a mildly retarded fellow who was being groomed as a suicide bomber by his Pakistani cellmate.  I was the one who hung the nickname &#8220;Mr. Potato Head&#8221; on the convert.</p>
<p>The Pakistani showed me a picture of his daughter, once.  A pretty girl.  Mahmoud told me that he wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate his daughter marrying someone like the Potato Head.  I told him that Islam seemed somewhat predatory in that respect.</p>
