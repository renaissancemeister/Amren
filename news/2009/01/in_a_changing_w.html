			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Betsy Hammond, Oregonian, Jan. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the nation&rsquo;s first African American president prepares to take office this week, metro Portland  &mdash;  with its overwhelmingly white population and leadership  &mdash;  is demographically out of step with 2009 America. </p>
<p>Among the nation&rsquo;s 40 largest metro areas, only four  &mdash;  none of them in the West  &mdash;  are whiter than Portland, new census figures show. </p>
<p>Longtime residents of metro Portland, particularly in Washington County and Gresham, talk a lot about how much racial change has come to their communities. And it has. </p>
<p>But since 2000, growth rates among Portland&rsquo;s small minority populations have slowed from the 1990s. In the same period, more than 100,000 additional non-Hispanic whites have flocked to the Portland area. The whitest suburb  &mdash;  Clark County outside Vancouver  &mdash;  alone added 53,000 white residents. </p>
<p>The upshot is that the Portland metro area is startlingly white viewed against the national landscape  &mdash;  even whiter than Salt Lake City, according to the latest Census Bureau estimates. Metro Portland includes Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas and Clark counties. </p>
<p>The implications are far-reaching. </p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s America, people of color make up more than 40 percent of a typical metro area&rsquo;s population, an analysis by The Oregonian shows. </p>
<p>But in metro Portland, public policy still is controlled from a white point of view. Among the hundreds of mayors, city council members and state lawmakers representing metro Portland, there are just four Latino city councilors, one African-born council member and a lone African American state senator. </p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s lack of diversity means it is less cosmopolitan, less dynamic and at risk of being less competitive than other metro areas, worries David Bragdon, president of the Metro regional government. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plus that Portland is a magnet for young, college-educated Americans who can choose to live anywhere, says William Frey, demographer for the Brookings Institution and a specialist in urban and suburban trends. </p>
<p>But college-educated Americans are overwhelmingly white, and those who migrate to Portland are disproportionately so  &mdash;  the &#8220;beer, bikes and Birkenstock&#8221; crowd, in the words of Portland economist Joe Cortright. </p>
<p>Portland-area employers competing for top talent have a hard time retaining African American hires, who often can&rsquo;t bear the social and cultural isolation of a metro area that is less than 3 percent black. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Portland area&rsquo;s nearly half-million people of color often get the message that their concerns are an afterthought, says Irma Valdez, a real estate agent who serves on the Portland Planning Commission. &#8220;Some of the stuff I hear on the planning commission would make you want to pass out,&#8221; she says. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Minority residents can feel left out, unable to easily find a hairdresser, a radio station that resonates, a church that feels like home, says Vicki Nakamura, who helps employers recruit and retain minority professionals. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Change at schools</p>
<p>In most of the metro area, particularly in east Multnomah County and in Washington County, schools  &mdash;  gathering places for the area&rsquo;s youngest generation  &mdash;  are where the leading edge of diversity is most visible. </p>
<p>Latinos, the fastest-growing group, now represent nearly one of every five Oregon students. Metrowide, white students have fallen to two-thirds of the enrollment. </p>
<p>Among 10 year-olds born in Oregon, one in seven had parents of different races or one parent who was Latino and one who was not. </p>
<p>Since 2000, diversity has increased most in the places where it was already greatest: in east Multnomah and Washington counties, particularly Gresham and Hillsboro. Last fall, Hillsboro became the first local community to elect two Latino city councilors: Mike Castillo, a manager at Intel, and Olga Acuna, a high school vice principal. </p>
<p>Unlike most metro areas, Portland&rsquo;s urban core isn&rsquo;t a hub for minorities. Instead, Portland is the whitest big city in the nation, at 74 percent white. Seattle, at 68 percent, is No. 2. </p>
<p>Expensive, close-in housing continues to draw more whites than minorities, census figures show. Since 2000, Portland added 10,000 white residents, reversing a trend from the 1990s. </p>
<p>The future</p>
<p>Portland will grow less white and more diverse  &mdash;  just more slowly than the rest of the country, experts say. Latinos in particular will play a much bigger role in the metro area&rsquo;s future. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got Hispanics moving to Indiana and Iowa, so they are going to come to Portland,&#8221; says Frey of the Brookings Institution. But their foothold on political power is likely to lag their numbers, he says, and white politicians will continue to call the shots for a growing Latino population for years. </p>
<p>Dina DiNucci, expertly forming a crepe behind the counter of her neighborhood coffee shop in Gresham, is ahead of the curve, living and working in one of the most ethnically diverse parts of metro Portland. Her customers include Latinos and Russian immigrants along with longtime white residents of the area. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are not just a white America anymore,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It is changing all around us.&#8221; <br/>

			<p>Portland has urban sprawl limits, which makes real estate expensive.  So of course it&rsquo;s going to be almost all white, especially yuppie lib white.</p>
<p>The article mentions that Portland is the kind of place where people who could live anywhere want to live.  What they mean by that is that Portland, like a lot of other places, have a reputation for being liberal, so this doubly attracts liberals and makes it more liberal.</p>

<p>Funny, everyone I&rsquo;ve ever talked to about Portland does nothing but shower praises on it and it sounds like one of the more cosmopolitan cities of it&rsquo;s size and definitely one of the most dynamic&hellip;and I imagine the economy is good.     I&rsquo;ve known a lot of young people who have moved out to Portland because of all the cultural/recreational offerings&hellip; But hey, it&rsquo;s no multicultural utopia like Detroit or Gary, IN.   </p>

			<p>Portland&rsquo;s low &#8220;minority&#8221; population was a major reason I chose to move here.  &#8220;Overwhelmingly white&#8221; is code for &#8220;low crime&#8221;, &#8220;friendly people&#8221; and &#8220;a sense of community&#8221;.  When my car got stuck in the snow recently, within 3 minutes three different people offered their assistance - and I&rsquo;m a middle-aged man.  I don&rsquo;t have to lock my doors at night or my car if I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like leftists but I&rsquo;d much rather live among them than among &#8220;people of color&#8221;.</p>

			<p> I don&rsquo;t know where this sort of story comes from&hellip;.  reporters with nothing to write about?  Not enough crime in Portland yet?  25% minorities is enough!</p>
<p>Betsy hasn&rsquo;t gone to Oaks Park in the past five years, the old fashioned amusement park in Portland.  Hardly any Whites there last year.  Where are the Whites?  Not there anymore.  I guess they are home wondering why they feel so privileged.  Oregonians are famous for ignoring the neighbor to their south, and learning anything useful.</p>

			<p>Can you imagine the outcry by blacks if Mr. Obama were called white by the news media instead of &#8220;African American&#8221;? They would be screaming racist from the roof tops. Why can&rsquo;t the media just be honest and call him biracial? It&rsquo;s an insult to his white mother every time they ignore the truth and call him black. Whites need to be a little more outspoken with regards to this politically correct propaganda of calling Obama African American.</p>

			<p>The relative lack of minorities is part of what makes Portland such a beautiful city.  They do have blacks there, and like everywhere else, they make a large contribution to all the indicators of social pathology.  Of course, the worst of social pathologies, liberalism, is largely found among the Whites.  </p>

			<p>This is one of the most unnerving and infuriating articles I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.  So what if Portland is 74% white.  Good for them.  Why is majority white a bad thing?  I live in El Paso, TX.  This city is over 80% Hispanic and is filthy and corrupt and next door to the most violent city in the western hemisphere, Juarez, Mexico.  I don&rsquo;t hear anyone complaining about the lack of diversity in El Paso.  Diversity is a one way street.  If you have 51% white and 49% non-white, well then you need more diversity.  If its the other way around, that&rsquo;s ok.  These liberal fascists won&rsquo;t cease until every pocket of whiteness has been rooted out and destroyed.  </p>

			<p>I know a young man who lives in that area. He is very intelligent, and is a &#8220;Preacher&rsquo;s Kid.&#8221; He used to be in my Sunday School class, and I had high regards for him.  </p>
<p>He recently wrote me about how he participated in some kind of annual naked bicycle ride for world peace or some such nonsense.<br/>
They had a dance before the event, with the dancers, both male and female, in the same state of nature in which they rode their bicycles. A sobering image.</p>
<p>And then, there are all sorts of gay activities, and environmental eccentrics, in that area.</p>
<p>The northwest is now the haven for White Misfits. But perhaps they are just the extreme edge of the Creative Class, a necessary corollary, regarded as fools by those with more sense (and self-respect)?</p>
<p>They are so trendy and with-it &hellip; and so overwhelmingly White. </p>
<p>But how can they be with-it &hellip; when Black is the new with-it cause celebre &hellip; and be so overwhelmingly White?</p>
<p>They are weird, but, judging from my young friend, I don&rsquo;t think they instinctively like Blacks, even though they will praise to the high heavens any Black who espouses their &#8220;with-it&#8221; positions. But these Blacks are very rare. Most Blacks are busy being what they are, with the lower IQ and &#8220;thug&#8221; lifestyle that puts off the Whites.</p>
<p>But perhaps a little Black Realism might help them to straighten up, and adopt, shall I say, a more manly way of acting?</p>
<p>Maybe the Obama phenomenom will be like a bracing bucket of ice-water thrown on the whole White race that is deep into illusion?</p>
<p>May Odin grant that it be so!      </p>

			<p>Portland is the whitest big city in America because it has restrictions on suburban development.  In other words, it&rsquo;s more like a European city.  It&rsquo;s also the only large city in America with a majority white public school enrollment.  Something for all the free market conservatives to think about.  </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how when an area becomes overwhelming Black, Asian or Hispanic, it is looked upon as natural and progressive? But anytime there is an area which is still overwhelmingly white, Marxist liberals call it shameful and embarrassing? Make no mistake about it, there is a plot to rob whites of their ethnic identity, and of their rights to basic exist as a unit, and as a majority anywhere in the West, and anywhere in the world for that matter.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Portland is the whitest big city in the nation, at 74 percent white. Seattle, at 68 percent, is No. 2&#8221;. </p>
<p>I wonder how that compares with the blackest of the big cities. Or the most Latin or Asian of the big cities?<br/>

I have been sorrounded by non-Whites my whole life and hope to save up so I can get away from them. Maybe I should just go &#8220;Ted Kazinski&#8221; and live in a cave in Montana. </p>

			<p>Email the author betsyhammond@news.oregonian.com - about Robert Putman&rsquo;s which contradicts the view that diversity is a strength. In fact it reduces trust and community engagement. </p>
<p>Also Tufts University analyzed 15 recent studies of the impact of diversity on social cohesion. In more diverse communities, people participate less as measured by how they allocate their time, their money, their voting and their willingness to take risks to help others.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>As someone who lived in Portland for five years, I can tell you that the city is overwhelmingly White and upscale!</p>
<p>The only Blacks and Latinos that can afford to live there are upscale ones and they do seem to blend in pretty well with the White yuppies.</p>
<p>Lower income people of all races have been forced to move out of the city given the cost of living.</p>

			<p>Portland is a magnet for young, college-educated Americans who can choose to live anywhere, and isn&rsquo;t it amazing that those who can choose to live anywhere they want to are flocking to the areas with the least diversity? That ought to say something to those who study such social phenomena.</p>

			<p>A little digging in the US Census data shows that the counties just beyond the three that make up Portland are even whiter - some with less than *half* the African American content of counties in northern Idaho, even.</p>
<p>People in those outer counties can enjoy real, Norman Rockwell America lifestyles, yet occasionally drive into town for excellent Asian or middle-eastern food, or an unusual cultural festival. Then driving back home, they can think &#8216;diversity is a nice place to visit, but I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to *live there.*&rsquo;</p>
<p>Also Portland regularly hosts the largest Polish festival on the west coast, and also still has some fairly active Scandinavian and Baltic cultural groups such as the Sons of Norway, where people can pass on their culture: music, language, national (folk) costumes, and dance steps, religious traditions, etc.</p>

			<p> You do not even have to read this article to know<br/>
what it is about. The headline speaks volumes -</p>
<p>&#8220;In a Changing World, Portland Remains Overwhelmingly White&#8221;</p>
<p> Being White is the problem in this so called changing<br/>
world. Funny how it isn&rsquo;t a problem, that in this &#8220;changing&#8221;<br/>
world Beijing isn&rsquo;t too Asian, or Zimbabwe too black. Funny<br/>
how Harlem isn&rsquo;t too black, but considered a vibrant ehtnic<br/>
community. Same can be said by them of any southwestern<br/>
hispanic city.</p>
<p> Whiteness is the problem to the social engineers. Whites<br/>
must share their homelands and cities for the sake of<br/>
artificially constructed diversity, and only Whites.</p>
<p> This is of course until there are no White lands left.We<br/>
must start standing up as a whole against this. The good<br/>
people on this website see what is happening. But until<br/>
Whites as a whole do, nothing will change. As half of<br/>
our race seems overjoyed by their race undergoing soft<br/>
ethnic cleansing. It ends when we demand it ends. No <br/>
sooner, and no later.<br/>

<p>&#8220;Competitive&#8221; in the same way that California is becoming????  If too many whites are a &#8220;problem&#8221; then more diversity (a.k.a. less whites) in an area would make it the most &#8220;competitive&#8221;.  Such as Camden, New Jersey.</p>
<p>If only I could get my hands on some of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; kool-aid these people are drinking then I could deny what I can see before my eyes and shut off half of my mind.</p>

			<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of Portland residents engaged in some sort of self-flagellation for living in such a white city. Go spend a week in Gary, Indiana or Detroit then count your lucky stars. I&rsquo;m sure that they are upset with not having to deal with astronomical rates of illegitimacy, multiple car-jackings, regular home invasion burglaries, more new prisons than you can stand (unless your state is smart enough to dump these in rural areas with 20% unemployment - like South Carolina does.) This sounds like a great place to visit. </p>

<p>Yes, typical. There&rsquo;s a reason for this. Always has been. But by all means, spend tax dollars to &#8220;relocate&#8221; them to your neighborhood. Crime? Well, rich liberals don&rsquo;t care. They don&rsquo;t mind being victimzed. Hence the term &#8220;liberal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or as I like to call them &#8220;typical&#8221; liberal.</p>
<p>Where I live, we have a typical metro area. Though it&rsquo;s more like 99.9 % &#8220;non white&#8221;. Though I&rsquo;m good at defending myself, I don&rsquo;t go there if I can help it. I&rsquo;m not dumb enough. I&rsquo;ve learned to avoid it and just as soon see it walled off.</p>

<p>Portland is liberal BECAUSE it has so few minorities.  If Portland was actually full of the minorities they profess to admire, Portland&rsquo;s Whites would adopt a political philosophy more in line with their counterparts in Jackson, Mississippi or Atlanta, Georgia.  </p>

			<p>But are the finances run well for Portland, with no fraud or embezzlement occurring, or public officials taking drugs and meeting prostitutes in motels?    If the Portland citizens want to live the way they do and with whom thay want, why should they be coerced into anything else especially when many of the other examples in the USA (and elsewhere) may be seriously flawed?</p>

			<p>What was wrong when America was too white.<br/>
Only American-Indians would have wished it was the minorities trying to over run them, back in the old days.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t these guilty whites move to mixed neighborhoods at a faster pase. We don&rsquo;t need them, nor will we miss them.</p>
<p>White flight proves that over fifty per cent of whites, choose not to live among minorities. I&rsquo;ve traveled to many states and i&rsquo;ve never seen one minority neighborhood striving to success.</p>

			<p>In the new age of black rule in the U.S. I am saddend that Portland is in danger of being &#8220;less cosmopolitan, less dynamic, and less competitive&#8221;. Consider the diverse nature of Washington D.C. and all the advantages of the city&rsquo;s dynamic, cosmopolitan atmosphere. According to the latest crime statistics Portland had 27 murders, D.C. had over 500 in the same time period. All violent crimes in Portland were 1.36 times the national average and in D.C. the rate was 2.63 times the national average. There were 20 times more murders and 6 times the number of robberies and rapes in D.C. as in Portland, and each city has approximately the same population. The difference? D.C is 56% black and 9% hispanic, Portland is over 70% white. Obviously D.C. is much more &#8220;dynamic&#8221;. Another city to consider. Dover New Hamphire. During the same time period no murders and violent crime was 0.11 times the national average. 24 times less than D.C. and 12 times less than Portland. At 95% white and 5% all others, including 0.33% black, obviously not very &#8220;dynamic&#8221;. Hopefully Portland will continue on the road to becoming more &#8220;diverse&#8221; and perhaps cut the rate of violent crime in my town to near zero.   </p>

			<p>True diversity is being able to celebrate authentic enclaves individually, and not make each place an equally proportioned mix of races.  So what&rsquo;s wrong with a few authentic white areas in the overall quilt of diversity?  Nothing.  But liberal Portlandites have a bad case of cognitive dissonance.</p>

Doesn&rsquo;t the headline tell you all you need to know?</p>
<p>That the world is changing and Portland is still overwhelmingly white tells us that anything overwhelmingly white must change.</p>
<p>As my Black Golden Rule states: That which is black must remain black. That which is white must be made black.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t consider 74% white to be too white.  I moved to Portland from San Diego in 2004 to get away from the excessive prices of California and the ruin brought in by diversity.  There are far too many Hispanics in California.  There are far more Hispanics and blacks here in Portland than is desirable.<br/>
They are busily turning Portland into California.  And, all those liberals with money are stingy cheapskates who hire Hispanics at low wages even though they could afford to pay higher wages.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Portland&rsquo;s lack of diversity means it is less cosmopolitan, less dynamic and at risk of being less competitive than other metro areas, worries David Bragdon, president of the Metro regional government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competitive in what way?  Street crime?  Prostitution?  Car thefts?  </p>
<p>&#8220;Portland-area employers competing for top talent have a hard time retaining African American hires, who often can&rsquo;t bear the social and cultural isolation of a metro area that is less than 3 percent black.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounds like some serious brain-drain.  I&rsquo;m assuming Oregon is suffering from a dearth of engineers and medical researchers because of this problem.</p>

			<p>Diversity brings you corruption, chaos, and crime.  20 years ago Stockholm, Sweden had almost no minorities.  Today increasing numbers of unassimalable Middle Easterners, North Africans, Black Africans. etc. are destroying the city. The violence rate, murder, rape and robbery have gone way up.  In the past these crimes were very rare.  Many streets are visibly dirty and littered, something that would never have been seen a few decades ago.  Women dare not walk alone at night.  Yes, the wonderful gifts of diversity.  The curse works everywhere.</p>

			<p>Those Portland residents who yearn for vibrant diversity can move a few miles east to Gresham, Oregon, which is mostly Hispanic. They don&rsquo;t do so, for some reason, even though the rents are cheaper. (I&rsquo;m an Oregon resident.)</p>

			<p>Anyone ever notice how the whitest cities are also the most liberal? This is especially true here in the West. I live in Salt Lake City and while the city itself is very liberal (surprising I know) the outlying areas and the rest of Utah is ultraconservative. If the whites in Seattle and Portland were forced to live cheek to jowl with non-whites they would change the crying that Portland is too white! During the housing boom many Hispanics moved into our neighborhood. With the economic downturn many are moving out and the equilibrium of the area is returning to the white majority that it was, a working class white neighborhood. </p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s also the only large city in America with a majority white public school enrollment&#8221;. </p>
<p>So, whites students are a minority in every large size city in America? Is that every city with over 100,000 residents? Or over 300,000 residents? Every city in the entire USA? Except for Portland. Good thing the press caught wind of this and ran an exposition on what&rsquo;s wrong with Portland! (sarcasm).<br/>

			<p>Oh, to have a 74% White population in OUR area. Houston &#8220;is proud&#8221; to have probably nearly 60% of the population being Black (Katrina evacuees) and Hispanics (most of them illegals and/or their adult anchor-babies). Needless to say, the crime rate is high. With the great majority of crimes committed by Blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>I got into a discussion with a liberal on a local news blog site. The liberal predictably, laying blame for crime on the poverty of those aforementioned minorities. Natch, it never occurred to the liberal the REAL CAUSE of crime is greed and envy. That minorities see what more affluent Whites own (and have worked hard for), and feeling they&rsquo;re entitled to take for themselves, what those &#8220;selfish&#8221; Whites are unwilling to share.</p>
<p>But crime in ethnically diverse (non-White) communities is always high. Nor is this phenomenon confined to America. Europeans are learning on a daily basis that multi-culturalism is equal to living in a high-crime area. Unfortunately our White European friends are prohibited from speaking out about this inarguable truth by official censorship.</p>

I mean look at all that magnificent multi-culti diversity. Those different cultures to savor. Those fine people of a variety of dark complexions. Or even better, why not relocate to an AFRICAN NATION. Where you could savor real diversity (that is, if those fine people making up other cultures allow you to survive).</p>

			<p>Portland style whites are probably the most marxist in the nation from my own personal experience with them.  If you disagree with them about one thing  &mdash;  in my case affirmative action  &mdash;  your shunned for life.  I won&rsquo;t feel sorry for them when they get to experience the joys of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; when we have another Katrina type incidient in the south and a few thousand project bred blacks have the luck of living next to these uber fake yuppies.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote to the Oregonian blog:</p>
<p>Leftists love to find any little of oasis of tranquility in the world and attack and destroy it. It&rsquo;s because they are hateful anarchists at heart. </p>
<p>Instead of looking at real sources of problems in the world, like the rapacious international bankers and corporations in America, or murderous dictators and mullahs in countries like Afrika and Arabia, and riling up the masses agaisnt those real evils, they instead, like all bullies, pick smaller, weaker targets, like little pockets of well behaved, pacifist white people minding their own business, and try to destroy them for being… white.</p>
<p>This kind of leftist muckraking is getting sickening, and someday, it will result in a real backlash if these leftist agent provocateurs don&rsquo;t start minding their own business, and leave people alone to enjoy their rights to &ldquo;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&rdquo;. Without having to worry about being slandered in their hometown newspapers, or made to feel guilty for coincidentally living around lots of other people who happen to share their same skin color.</p>
<p>Even if it is the leprous &ldquo;white&rdquo; these leftists have been conditioned to hate.</p>
<p>The more anti-white meddlesome stunts I see like this, the more I can see why lunatic dictators try to gain power and kill all self appointed, self righteous meddlers, because you drive them to it with your ill intentioned, slanderous campaigns against innocent people minding their own business in a supposedly &ldquo;free&rdquo; country.</p>
<p>I would suggest you little meddlers and petty self appointed social engineers start minding your own business, before you accidentally create the very thing you&rsquo;re most trying to avoid, an ethnic based revolution… by pissing people off and backing them into a corner until they decide to become the very thing you&rsquo;ve falsely denounced them as.</p>
<p>Let me explain something:</p>
<p>Freedom of Association is guaranteed in the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Freedom of Association also implies Freedom of Disassociation.</p>
<p>In other words, people have the freedom to associate or not associate with or without whoever they choose, without fear of government, religious or socialist meddling.</p>
<p>Forcing, browbeating or coercing people to associate with people they normally wouldn&rsquo;t, or just haven&rsquo;t for whatever reason, is unConstitutional.</p>
<p>To attempt to slander and intimidate people into using their own tax money to import people they may not want to associate with, or have not naturally mingled with, purely based on skin color, is wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also unnatural. It is Communist/Nazi/Fascist style social engineering at it&rsquo;s worst… it&rsquo;s just the mirror image of Hitlers Nazism, but portraying itself as &ldquo;good&rdquo; because it attempts to destroy groups of white people instead of create more of them.</p>
<p>The solution is to just leave people alone, and let natural mixing and movement take it&rsquo;s course.</p>
<p>As long as they aren&rsquo;t hurting anybody else, then it&rsquo;s none of anyone&rsquo;s business who other people live around.</p>
<p>If you leftist fascists want to see some black, brown or asian people, then go visit some where they live, instead of trying to drag them all to you using psychological guilt tripping and other peoples tax money.</p>
