<h1>More Than a Thousand Cars Torched on New Year&rsquo;s Eve</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, January 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 445 cars were torched over the night of New Year&rsquo;s Eve in France, a 20 percent rise on last year, but there were relatively few clashes with police, the Interior Ministry and police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Car burnings are regular occurrences in France but the registering the New Year&rsquo;s Eve total has become something of a tradition since they achieved symbolic status in the violent rioting that shook many of the country&rsquo;s poor suburbs in 2005.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Interior Ministry official said that as of 6:00 a.m. (0500 GMT), 445 car burnings had been registered, against 372 at the same time a year before and police had made 288 arrests, compared with 259 on Dec. 31, 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were around 50 burnings in the eastern city of Strasbourg, where police made 17 arrests, including four people caught while setting fire to cars.</p>
<p>In the southern city of Toulouse, 12 cars were burned in areas at the edge of the city limits, while in Nantes, around 10 cars were torched although police in the western city said New Year&rsquo;s Eve had been &#8220;pretty calm&#8221;.</p>
<p>Update: The French press reported that the Interior Ministry released a final &#8220;verified&#8221; count of 1,147 vehicles burned in France over New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The number is up 30.64% from last year&rsquo;s total, 878.<br>

			<p>Might it be a good idea to kick them out of the country? It seems so obvious, I&rsquo;d have to wonder if evil white nationalists in France are behind the scenes orchestrating it all just for this evil purpose. Except that we live in &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; times and these hoodlums are people of color, and not white. Mayhem, destruction and terror actually work as a positive for people of color.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;There were few &#8216;contacts&rsquo; with police, gendarmes and fire services but an increase in the number of burnings for which we don&rsquo;t have an explanation at the moment,&#8221; the official said.&#8221;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know why this is happening?  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the official&rsquo;s name is Forest Gumpier, who is France&rsquo;s answer to America&rsquo;s Forest Gump, who wouldn&rsquo;t know that the non-whites torch and trash, because they hate whites and France as well.  It&rsquo;s their way of saying &#8220;thanks for taking us in.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess French officials feel having to activate 35,000 police to quell riots and arson is a small price to pay in order to get all the benefits that diversity has to offer.</p>

			<p>This does not sound like much&hellip;..compared to Halloween in Detroit&hellip;..er uh&hellip;..Devil&rsquo;s Night. And in Detroit, the focus is not on automobiles&hellip;.they burn structures. Leave it to Detroit to be the worst.</p>

			<p>In civilized nations, arsonists are hanged, in recognition of the fact that, unlike an ordinary murderer, a firestarter threatens untold thousands of lives.  At the very least, any legitimate government should recognize the right of the citizens to protect their property from mob violence by any means necessary.  Does any western nation meet that criteria?</p>

			<p>The cars were not &#8220;torched,&#8221; they were &#8220;lighted.&#8221;  Lighting automobiles is a time honored tradition going back at least 900 days.  Typically, rambunctious youths cluster around vehicles and practice getting their campfire badge using whatever is available.  In the city, that would be cars and trucks.  They revel in the camradarie of of the group and enjoy the warmth of the fire.    Their joy is occasionally shattered by native white capitalists who insist on sending out uniformed goons to put an end to their merriment.  </p>

			<p>This sounds like another custom we can import into the United States in the name of diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>As pointed out, we burn structures on Devils Night and now we can burn cars on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Perhaps we can add some senseless violence to as a means of celebrating each holiday. </p>

<p>Probably us. </p>
<p>The destruction going on in the United States is no different than what is happing in France or the UK. It is just not as blatant.<br>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard a peep.   (It all depends on who&rsquo;s doing it.)</p>

<p>Youths? Come now!  Don&rsquo;t put too much weight on them, the poor babies!   I&rsquo;ve even seen them referred to as &#8220;schoolkids&#8221;, &#8220;young boys&#8221;,  and  &#8220;children&#8221;!!! &hellip;  (choke, choke)<br>
  &mdash;    not to mention the predictable accusation of &#8220;decades of discrimination&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all because of those damn racist white people that France [read: Europe] has too many of. (Gotta fix that!)</p>

<p>The reason is that with the collapse of the Big-3, there are no more automobiles left in Detroit.</p>

<p>Thanks GHW.<br>
I only &#8216;tolerated&rsquo; two minutes of this meisterwerk (five more minutes to go, I just could not &#8216;tolerate&rsquo; any more) of unrivalled cobblers. I lauged - sighed - then laughed again!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have a garage. They&rsquo;d have to smash through the door, break into the car, reverse it back onto the street and then turn it over and set it on fire. Way too hard!</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;the right of the citizens to protect their property from mob violence by any means necessary. Does any western nation meet that criteria?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1772, Samuel Adams said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Natural Rights of the colonists are these:  first, a right to live; second to liberty; third to property; together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And you thought Samuel Adams was the only the name of a beer).</p>
<p>As long as the Second Amendment is still in effect, and last I checked it is still legal to own personal firearms, I will defend myself, my family and my property with deadly force if necessary.</p>
<p>In the recent case of the District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. (2008), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual&rsquo;s right to possess a firearm for private use. </p>
<p>Who would I expect to protect me and my loved ones?  Would you wait around for (or expect) the government to protect you?  This is why Richard Maybury suggests surrounding yourself with like-minded folks.</p>
<p>https://chaostan.com/bulletin-092208.html</p>
<p>And for a small, overweight, middle-aged mother and step-grandmother, I handle firearms well.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s Sake, the Second Amendment should be protected with everything we have, it&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got left.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s been said here before by others, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating: Don&rsquo;t expect the police or the government to save you. In a crisis, they&rsquo;ll have all they can do to save themselves; and they&rsquo;ll be answering to the race-pandering politicians, not you. </p>
<p>Yes, maybe they&rsquo;ll come to your rescue, hopefully, but don&rsquo;t count on it. Be prepared. In a time of break-down (if we come to that), it&rsquo;s everyone for himself.</p>

			<p>This is the result of trying to mix oil and water when it comes to muslims and europeans and its&rsquo; only the beginning. Was France more peaceful before or after these immigrants came?? Of course we all know the answer to that one. Why do the multicults insist that diversity is our strength?</p>
