<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28472710/">McDonald&rsquo;s Supersized Retirement Plans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Young, MSNBC, January 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To stanch the bleeding of valuable talent, McDonald&rsquo;s in 2004 began offering a rich retirement savings perk. Employees who put 5 percent of their salary in the company 401(k) receive a company match of as much as 11 percent, turbocharging their savings right off the bat. To make sure employees take advantage of the program, McDonald&rsquo;s has made enrollment automatic. And to ease the pain of automatically deferring 1 percent of pay, the company gave managers a one-time, 1 percent salary increase.</p>
<p>But persuading prized employees that the benefit is reason enough to stay with McDonald&rsquo;s for the long term is an ongoing challenge. Skepticism about investing runs especially high among African Americans, who make up 15 percent of the company&rsquo;s manager pool. Research shows that blacks, in the aggregate, are reluctant to save. According to a 2008 study by Ariel Investments and Charles Schwab, blacks save an average of $169 a month for retirement, while comparable whites (in terms of household income) contribute about $249 a month. Race and ethnicity trump gender &mdash; and even salary &mdash; in the factors that predict whether a person will save for retirement.</p>
<p><b>Preparing for the future</b></p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks save more? The reasons are complex, but the underlying theme is cultural. &#8220;African Americans are distrustful of the financial system because it has excluded them for generations,&#8221; says Andr√©s Tapia, chief diversity officer at Hewitt Associates, the benefits-consulting giant. Hewitt&rsquo;s research shows that African Americans consistently put home ownership and college ahead of retirement goals. Owning a home and educating children become a huge priority, explains Tapia, &#8220;if you are the first person in your family to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Preparing for the future can also be controversial in the black community. &#8220;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by &mdash; putting aside money that you can&rsquo;t touch for the next 15 to 20 years feels selfish and inappropriate,&#8221; Tapia says.</p>
<p>Indeed, for many blacks, retirement is more a dream than a priority. The Ariel-Schwab survey found that African Americans under the age of 50 are nearly twice as likely as comparable whites to say they want to retire by 60, but they are half as likely to cite retirement as their most important savings goal.</p>

			<p>Not one of the reasons cited was valid, but they were all politically correct. Blacks have poor impulse control, a &#8216;bling&rsquo; culture and just don&rsquo;t tend to plan long term.</p>

			<p>Negative results are usually the result of negative behavior, except when said results are experienced by blacks.</p>
<p>This is my favorite part of the article: &ldquo;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by &mdash; putting aside money that you can&rsquo;t touch for the next 15 to 20 years feels selfish and inappropriate,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it impossible for the explanation for their absolute inability to EVER plan for the future be that they themselves are NOT altruistic, but inherently so selfish in their own right that they blow every cent that they have to buy the things that they want right now?</p>
<p>Additionally, they don&rsquo;t save or effectively participate in the banking system because they, as a group, simply don&rsquo;t understand it, a fact that is manifested by what we saw during katrina, the mortgage crisis, etc.  It never ends.</p>

			<p>Why not combine this story with the last story? Something like, <br>
&#8220;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by  &mdash;  not murdering people for gain feels kind of selfish and inappropriate,&#8221; Tapia says.</p>
<p>Anyway, who would desire retirement at McDonald&rsquo;s, where they offer to match 11% of what you save as a means to turbocharge your 401K? Who indeed? Maybe that has something to do with &#8216;McDonald&rsquo;s problem&rsquo;.<br>

			<p>The &#8220;one cookie now versus five cookies tomorrow&#8221; test answered this.  Blacks in general don&rsquo;t have the IQ to consider such cerebral concepts such as delayed gratification, time value of money and one&rsquo;s own future in general.  All there is to them (again, as a matter of generality) is now.</p>
<p>Also, this is why life imprisonment for capital crimes is far less feared than execution among black thugs, because execution is &#8220;now,&#8221; and life in prison is that ethereal future that they can&rsquo;t comprehend.  This is why to have any semblance of order, you have to have the legal option of the death penalty in heavily black political jurisdictions.</p>

			<p>I have begun a new training regimen. It was supposed to be a city boy learning how not to freeze to death in the woods but then I changed it to how to survive downtown overnight. In the coming collapse there will be those prepared and those who don`t have a clue. I`m getting a good feel for it already livng 24 hours a time on hot coffee, slim jims and Starbursts. I`ve also engaged some derelicts as to what their survival techniques are and how racial estrangement in urban areas  might &#8220;color&#8221; their plans. The one problem I have come across is finding a &#8220;buddy&#8221; to work this exercise with. I learned from bartending years ago  that if you don`t have a future or a plan at least find a buddy to watch your back. More on this as it develops. Next week, no shower for three days&hellip; My spouse thinks I`ve finally gone round the bend&hellip; </p>

The last sentence in the article says it all! Most likely to want to quit working; least likely to plan for the future. And that&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault WHY?!<br>

<p>Fine, then don&rsquo;t ask whites to take care of you.  You don&rsquo;t trust the &#8220;system&#8221;, yet you want it to support you.</p>

<p>According to UMass:</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1992, the life expectancy of a person born in the U.S. was 76 years. It was 74 for Black women, 65 for Black men, 80 for white women, and 73 for white men. Thus, white people will live, on the average, 7 years longer than Black people. Startlingly, in 1990 two researchers found that the life expectancy for a Black man in Harlem was lower than for a man in Bangladesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you see your cohorts dying early, why would you put aside money for a time that you can&rsquo;t imagine will ever come?  Even if medical advances mean you&rsquo;ll live longer than you think you will, that&rsquo;s hard to mentally process.  My grandfather lived to be almost 90, but expected to last no more than 70.  He was absolutely stunned (and unprepared) to live so long, and was miserable.  </p>

			<p>As has been said many times, Europeans evolved in a four-season climate, where planning for the future was critical for survival.  </p>
<p>Africans evolved in a temperate environment, where impulsiveness and loud displays were rewarded - hence the difference between white and black behavior.</p>

			<p>Blacks put education ahead of retirement?  Given their obvious lack of interest in learning, it&rsquo;s no wonder they don&rsquo;t save any money for something they value even less.  </p>

			<p>This has to be the most truly and absurdly vomititious piece I&rsquo;ve ever seen in AmRen.  Blacks put home ownership and education above saving for retirement?  I suppose viewed in complete isolation this could be true. If the list of choices had included big screen TVs, Cadillac Escalades, boom-boxes, pop-wines, rim-to-road white side-walls, and front porch furniture the priorities would have shifted considerably.  </p>

<p>Whaa? What law prevents Blacks from buying a mutual fund or buying stock? What law prevents them from purchasing asubscription to MONEY magazine? Where I work in a check processing facility in the Midwest, the workforce must be in the 50-70% Black proportion; the most amazing thing is the number of Blacks that eat out for lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by &mdash; putting aside money that you can&rsquo;t touch for the next 15 to 20 years feels selfish and inappropriate,&rdquo; </p>
<p>During the 1980s, WLS-AM had a program at night called &#8220;The Phyllis Levy Show.&#8221; One night, she had a subject in which she asked people to call in about personal betrayal. Well, a Black gentleman called in; he said he was a Vietnam veteran who had fought. He was sending his paycheck home to his mother to bank away. When he got home he asked for his money. His MOTHER said that they had taken all his paychecks and SPENT THEM. He said he just left and never contacted them again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why don&rsquo;t blacks save more? The reasons are complex&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really, the reason is simple: Blacks have no reason to save for retirement.  Whitey has always taken care of them, and there is no reason to believe that he won&rsquo;t continue to do so in the future.  Irresponsible and have multiple children out-of-wedlock?  Don&rsquo;t worry, whitey will pay for your kids.  Worried about getting into college because you played around in school and have a C- average?  Don&rsquo;t worry, whitey will make sure you go to Harvard on a full scholarship.  Can&rsquo;t afford your rent because you spent your entire welfare check on new 24&#8221; rims for your lime green &#8216;75 Cadillac?  Don&rsquo;t worry, whitey will pay your rent for you (even better, he will get you a brand new house in a formerly all-white neighborhood - plenty of teenage white girls to whistle at and grab your crotch in front of).  <br>
If it weren&rsquo;t for the welfare state and white social workers, half of the black population would be dead in 2 months - either from starvation or from killing each other because LaQueesha slept with one of Pepto-Bismalysha&rsquo;s babby-daddys or because Ray-Ray accidentally stepped on Mohammed Abu Jarmellio&rsquo;s $200 tennis shoes.</p>

<p>Yes, sounds like a definite case of paranoid schizophrenia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m distrustful of the financial system because it has me for generations.&#8221; Is that something that black people actually say, or is that the kind of explanation that liberals make up for them?</p>

			<p>Since when have Blacks been troubled by feelings of selfishness?  Most of them can&rsquo;t be bothered to care for their own kids, so why should they feel that they owe anything to their mothers?  Most of them throw their money around on shiny playthings, but I&rsquo;m supposed to believe that the reason they don&rsquo;t save is so that they can care for their aging parents?  This fellow is asking me to believe that Blacks have too much of a sense of responsibility to others to prepare for their own retirement.  <br>
     On re-reading the article, I notice that Andres Tapia is a Chief Diversity Officer.  That is, he is a party line enforcer.  His job is not to explain the world as it is, but to tell the slaves just what they&rsquo;d better pretend to believe if they want to keep their jobs.  O.K. Boss, whatever you say.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it remarkable how Blacks are only &#8220;sceptical&#8221; of these white institutions that would actually benefit them. Still, who believes Blacks feel &#8220;excluded&#8221; from the finacial system anyway? Oh Really?? They seem to be all too willing to buy or lease expensive cars they cannot afford, take out mortgages they cannot hope to pay back, buy, buy, buy so they can flaunt their imaginary &#8220;wealth.&#8221; But we are supposed to believe the irresponsibility of Blacks regarding their financial futures is all just some vestige of that nasty &#8216;ol White racism&hellip;you know just like eveything else they screw-up!! </p>

<p> I agree. First you have to commit yourself to blaming whitey. Once you do this, 51% of the US population will feel sorry for you. Once this is accopmlished, you can almost do no wrong in the public eye. Even those who don&rsquo;t support your views, will almost NEVER publically speak out against you.</p>
<p> Also, welfare will always be there for you in one way or another. Legal or not, the system will somehow keep you fed, clothed and housed. Whether you work or not, full time or part, the US Govt will see to it that you do not become homeless.</p>
<p> Whether you&rsquo;re a black male or a black female, remember, the more children you breed, the more welfare dollars to go around. You DO NOT have to be married and any or all of your children&rsquo;s education will be provided for. All you have to do is stay out of the way and collect your Govt funds.</p>
<p> While the US Govt would rather NOT have you break the law, this is always an option. Chances are the system will let you slide the first few times. And if/when you are eventually incarcerated, keep in mind, room and board will once again be provided.</p>
<p> As long as whitey is held at fault, you will always have that to fall back on. Why save for the future when you can have someone else do it for you.</p>
<p> Yes&hellip;real complex. Kinda like journalism from MSNBC&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;<i>The reasons are complex, but the underlying theme is cultural.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>No, the reasons are simple, and the underlying theme is genetic.  The overwhelming majority of blacks simply don&rsquo;t have the capacity for abstraction required to make future plans.  If they did, Africa, Detroit and South Philly would be the jewels of the Western world.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>African Americans are distrustful of the financial system because it has excluded them for generations,</i>&rdquo;  says our &#8220;chief diversity officer.&#8221;  Hmmm&hellip;  No possible bias there, is there?  Reality check: the only people &#8220;excluded&#8221; from the financial system are the ones with no money.  </p>
<p>As a hard-working White man who will be retiring within the year, I can explain in a few simple steps how to keep from being &#8220;excluded&#8221; from the financial system:  1: Get a job.  2: Keep it.  3: Do not spend more than you earn.  4: Save.</p>
<p>There, Officer Hewitt   &mdash;   that wasn&rsquo;t hard at all, was it?  Oh, but if you were to tell <i>that</i> to your employers, your cushy, well-paid job as &#8220;chief diversity officer&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t last long, would it?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hewitt&rsquo;s research shows that African Americans consistently put home ownership and college ahead of retirement goals.</i>&#8221;  Oh, really?  Please, Officer Hewitt, let us see the data for your &#8220;research.&#8221;  We&rsquo;d all love to know where you found all those ghetto-grubbers who &#8220;put home ownership and college&#8221; ahead of other goals.</p>
<p>More excuse-making and wishful thinking, shamelessly reported as fact by the controlled governmedia.  </p>

			<p>Blacks can ot deny or postpone gratification for themselves. They are childlike in their approach to life,extremely impulsive, wild mood swings (ecstatic one moment, violent the next). They are also narcisistic, and unreliable, society continues to excuse all bad behavior. Blacks will never invest in their future, because that means denying themselves immediate gratification. Many blacks get paid on Friday, walk around with their whole paycheck in their wallet, and after a weekend of debauchery they are broke on Sunday. Anywhere in the world that blacks congregate in large numbers, violence, murder, and mayhem soon follow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met 2 young black women that the exact same thing happened to. Both joined the army right out of high school at age 18.  They lived like misers, stayed on Post, bought no clothes,no car, no trips or entertainment and sent nearly all their paychecks to Mamma to save.</p>
<p>When they got home the money was totally gone, about $30,000 representing 3 years savings.</p>
<p>They were only 18 when they joined up.  At that age they weren&rsquo;t sophisticated enough financially to set up some sort of account for themselves. So they sent their paychecks home to Mamma every month and the money disappeared.  The Mammas weren&rsquo;t welfare Mammas either.  Both Mothers were government employees.<br>

			<p>Even mega-millionaire blacks don&rsquo;t save a cent. During the 1988-99 NBA lockout, Patrick Ewing seriously advocated establishing an emergency fund to help &#8220;impoverished&#8221; players. We&rsquo;re talking about veterans who had been pulling down millions <i>every year</i> for several seasons but were now on the edge of destitution. Where did all that money go? On what I call &#8220;the four B&rsquo;s&#8221;   &mdash;   booze, blow, bimbos &amp; bling.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another aspect of Ewing&rsquo;s plea   &mdash;   namely, child support payments that continued to come due, paycheck or no paycheck. I once read that on average each NBA player is supporting one illegitimate child. So for every player (likely white) who&rsquo;s had none, someone else (almost certainly black) has had two or more.</p>

			<p>I hate to say it, but this time I think the blacks just do the smart thing in ignoring saving-plans.</p>
<p>In history, every unbacked paper-money scheme has ended in hyperinflation, so when Richard Nixon pulled the Gold-backing of the dollar, it was merely a matter of time. Actually it would be a new thing if it didn&rsquo;t end in inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation means free money for those who can print it (no problem when you don&rsquo;t have to back your paper with gold or silver) and as we have seen the Fed is willing to create a lot of new money to bail out their banker-friends (and other friends too of course).<br>
Giving credit without interest is free money. (they do have a 0% target rate, don&rsquo;t they?)</p>
<p>Any dollar-nominated asset (and probably a lot of other currencies as well) will be completely worthless within probably a decade.</p>
<p>And by worthless I mean worthless. Do you know the pictures of the Germans in the 1920s using bundles of Marks for heating? Who will guarantee you that your money is save? Will you accept more dollars as a guarantee?</p>
<p>Gold is the best savings-plan:<br>
- it cannot be inflated<br>
- it cannot be taxed (it&rsquo;s anonymous and the state cannot tax what it doesn&rsquo;t know)<br>
- it is accepted everywhere in the world<br>
- it performed better in the 2000&rsquo;s even BEFORE the subprime crisis (check the charts for yourself)</p>

			<p>Uhm&hellip; This is america.  Does anyone save for retirement?  I mean I know that there are 401(K) plans and stuff, but statistics prove that almost no one has a rainy day fund anymore.</p>
<p>I think it is funny that the media constantly tries to depict blacks as adults, but the way that they constantly make excuses for them reminds me of the way that a mother constantly makes excuses for the poor behavior of her children.  That being said, what is one the things that seperates the &#8220;mature&#8221; vs. the &#8220;immature&#8221; (i don&rsquo;t mean sexually either) is the ability to delay gratification.</p>
<p>Of course this could get right at the heart of the warm-culture versus cold-culture argument.  Saving for the winter is a thing unknown south of the sahara.</p>
<p>All I know is that wherever there are sub-saharan africans in any significant numbers on this planet that the same problems arise.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Preparing for the future can also be controversial in the black community. &ldquo;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by &mdash; putting aside money that you can&rsquo;t touch for the next 15 to 20 years feels selfish and inappropriate,&rdquo; Tapia says.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought it was a selfish act to burden others in your old age and expect them to do for you, so consequently you should save towards that end to provide for yourself as much as possible.<br>
I guess I was raised wrong.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d have to say that most blacks live for the now. That&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve ever known, living paycheck-paycheck. That&rsquo;s mostly what I&rsquo;ve always been around in public schools. A few smart ones here and there will distance themselves from their family, their neighborhood, and their culture to actually have a better life. It&rsquo;s rare. That&rsquo;s why the system is being changed for them and for their advancement. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of a couple of blacks who have won lottery jackpots over $100,000. Gone in a couple of weeks, they&rsquo;re back playing scratch-offs and daily drawings everyday as usual.</p>

			<p><i>This is my favorite part of the article:  &ldquo;If your mama lives with you &mdash; and others in your extended community are struggling to get by &mdash; putting aside money that you can&rsquo;t touch for the next 15 to 20 years feels selfish and inappropriate,&rdquo;<br>

Yes, I noticed that little tidbit too.   How they manage to twist things around!  They  make being spendthrift sound so noble and virtuous   &mdash;    the fact is that they simply cannot resist spending every dime as soon as they get it.  To the contrary, saving for the future is &#8220;selfish and inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh no!  They have to look after poor mamma and the other poor souls who are having such a hard time &#8220;struggling to get by&#8221;.   (It&rsquo;s that white racism that they&rsquo;re up against, you know.  They don&rsquo;t even have to mention it, but it&rsquo;s always there.)</p>
<p>Naturally, whites don&rsquo;t have elderly mammas to worry about, or relatives who are struggling.   Age, Illness, and misfortune don&rsquo;t happen to us. </p>

			<p>The TRUE KEY to accumulating wealth is delayed gratification, not exactly a black strong suit. Look at how the black inability to exercise gratification control comes out in other areas, high rates of illegitimacy and STD&rsquo;s. Look at the black crime rate, especially violent crime and homicides. A homicide is sometimes called an assault that didn&rsquo;t stop in time. Blacks in general just don&rsquo;t have a long time horizon. Short time horizons and wealth building are usually incompatible.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what silver lining you were born under, but I&rsquo;ve had more illness and misfortune than most grown men could ever handle in a lifetime. I&rsquo;m white, female, and only 31. Whites are not untouchables who have never seen hard times. I don&rsquo;t want visitors to this site to think that. I have my opinions because I was raised a certain way by decent, moral white parents; but &#8216;the sun rises on the evil and the good, rain is sent on the righteous and the unrighteous&rsquo;. Our mothers are living to older ages because of medical advancements. It&rsquo;s hard tending to children and your parents, but that&rsquo;s life. Taking care of family should be priority. Stuggling makes it all worth it. That&rsquo;s what makes us who we are. </p>

			<p>A firm where I used to work instituted a very generous profit-sharing plan. For every dollar you put into the fund, they would match it with another. It was a terrific deal.  They were literally GIVING money away!  The only catch was that you couldn&rsquo;t withdraw it for at least two years, I believe. Perhaps it was five.  Most of the management put in as much as they could, right up to the max allowed. They knew a good deal when they saw one.</p>
<p>The black employees, however, were disinterested.  It amazed me to see this.  As best I remember, not a single one of them took advantage of this offer. I remember one of them saying that she needed the money right now and wasn&rsquo;t going to wait around for a coupe of years before she culd get at it (even though it would have been double, plus appreciation and interest!). </p>
<p>This perfectly illustrates the experiment with the kids of a cookie today or five cookies tomorrow.  Blacks don&rsquo;t care about tomorrow; they want it all NOW!</p>

The article speaks of trying to retain &#8220;prized employees&#8221; and it was my understanding that the offer was aimed mostly at management.</p>
