			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Warn, AfterEllen.com, January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York magazine reports that ad agencies are suddenly eager to cast young girls who look like Sasha and Malia Obama to sell products. {snip}</p>
<p>But wait, hold the phone! Is that even possible? Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina Kids &amp; Teens, says the First Daughters are tough subjects to match because, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a very specific age and a very specific ethnicity, so there aren&rsquo;t that many girls that would necessarily fit the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, what? It&rsquo;s difficult to find cute young black girls? What city/country have you been living in? What you really meant to say is, &#8220;Damn, I guess we really should have had more than one black model on our payroll before now!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do love the fact that modeling agencies are now being forced to hire more black girls and women. As the continued discouraging results from the classic white-doll/black-doll studies show (as recently as 2006!), there&rsquo;s clearly a need for greater visibility and celebration of darker-skinned women.</p>
<p>What do you all think  &mdash;  another positive outcome from the Obama election, another depressing sign of America&rsquo;s obsession with consumerism, or proof that we still have a long way to go to achieve true racial equality? (Or all three?)<br>

			<p>When will it end?  Has anyone watched the Miss Universe pageants of recent years?  Even the blonde countries don&rsquo;t use blonde women anymore.  They use &#8220;ethnic&#8221; women. This is why I don&rsquo;t watch them anymore.  These companies/programs/agencies/etc&hellip; that are pushing for this &#8220;the ethnic look is equal to or better than the blonde look&#8221; are only digging their own graves.</p>

<p>Thats fine mzzz sarah warn. You spend your time celebrating darker skinned women. Something that even many black males refuse to do. The rest of us have lives to tend to. <br>

			<p>I agree with Mrs. Obama (mark your calendars) that zeroing in on her young daughters for marketing purposes against the will of themselves or their parents is highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>But the unfortunate reality is this: so many people in the marketing and media industries go absolutely gaga when they think they&rsquo;ve found a new black celebrity to exploit, especially in an area normally dominated by whites. Presidents and first families, for instance. </p>
<p>Another good example would be NFL quarterbacks, nearly all the greatest of which have been white. Anyone remember the flap over Rush Limbaugh and Philadelphia Eagles QB Donovan McNabb a few years back? McNabb was doing good, but not nearly as good enough to deserve all the hype and fawning the sports press was showering on him. Limbaugh got fired from his job as a talking head on ESPN for pointing this out, and also pointing out that the media&rsquo;s real fascination with him was rooted in their deep desire to have the next great black QB. </p>
<p>It was undeniably true, and much hype had been made over McNabb being just that. Still, to say so in public was apparently verboten. Fortunately for the Eagles, McNabb is the type who when being put down, adopts an I&rsquo;ll-show-you attitude and starts playing at the top of his game. He had a great season, and Limbaugh was happy to take the credit for it.</p>
<p>For some reason, the media types think they just <i>have</i> to have blacks to promote. I&rsquo;m really still not sure why. </p>

<p>Not true, even those cute little Black girls would rather look at Gisele Bundchen and wish they were her.  The fashion industry knows that when they put a Black model on the cover of a magazine, they can expect a serious drop in on-site sales.  It&rsquo;s a loss they are willing to take every now and then just so they don&rsquo;t have Al Sharpton  and BET breathing down their necks.</p>
<p>Having lived in New York and known plenty of people in the fashion industry, I can tell you, for a fact, that when a Black girl wins a modeling contract through  &#8216;America&rsquo;s Next Top Model&rsquo;, all they do is sit around the agency all day  &mdash;  no one wants them.  </p>
<p>Unlike the school systems, there is very little room for affirmative action in fashion.  Only beauty sells, and most Black girls, no matter how much makeup and airbrushing, just don&rsquo;t have what it takes.  This is still one of the most race-honest industries left in America.</p>

			<p>This story conlfates the &#8220;modeling&#8221; world with the straight up central-casting advertising/marketing world. One cannot turn on the TV, open a magaize, etc., without some grinning Black face, young or old, staring back at them. The idea that there is some sort of dearth of Blacks in marketing is absolutely preposterous! In modeling however, it is another story. Certain standards of beauty dictate who or what is considered valuable there, despite obvious attempts to increase &#8220;diversity.&#8221; And the modeling world is hardly filled with evil White &#8220;racists.&#8221; Bleeding-hearts and homosexuals yes, but White bigots&hellip;please. So you do the math&hellip;</p>

			<p>BW Sam,</p>
<p>The reason white people love to fawn over black people is pity.</p>
<p>By demonstrating goodwill toward the less fortunate, you demonstrate a vast altruism that makes you clearly the good guy.</p>
<p>It increases social status and makes warm fuzzy feelings among the average people out there, who don&rsquo;t think much, are contra-analytical and just want a nice warm happy uplifting escape from reality.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that why we&rsquo;re in decline?</p>

			<p>As most of us know&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to find cute little black girls, you have to look for dark kids with white features .</p>
<p>Because, just like with the Obama  &hellip; people are naturally racist by nature, they just don&rsquo;t find deep pure black appealing .<br>
Very significantly,  this includes blacks themselves.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t watch movies with blacks in any significant role; I don&rsquo;t watch sports on T.V., because there&rsquo;s too many blacks; I won&rsquo;t buy any products or services that has a black as a spokesperson; and I won&rsquo;t do business with an institution or business if it has affirmative action blacks working there.</p>
<p>So if the fashion industry starts shoving black models of any age to the front of the line, I won&rsquo;t read or watch anything that has to do with them either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to look at blacks; I don&rsquo;t like to talk to them, and I don&rsquo;t like to be around them.</p>
<p>Have I had a single traumatic event involving blacks to make me feel that way?  No.  At least not anymore than anyone else.  My feelings are based on the way blacks act, talk, whine, try to blame whites for their lack of intelligence and low I.Q. and test scores, and the way they look.  I utterly dislike their loud, noisy mouths that push a lot of words across their lips, but say nothing of any intelligence.  So whenever I hear a black talking head on T.V. cry about some imagined injustice, or one of them whine about racism, or one of them defend one of their murderers or other criminals, or one of them blame whites for black failures, my revulsion reaches a new pitch and all this bad karma just increases the revulsion factor deep within my soul.</p>
<p>More blacks in the fashion industry?  Well, o.k., but they  won&rsquo;t be selling me anything.  Sell it to some white fool who hates him/herself or is too dumb to know better.</p>

<p>If this writer doesn&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a wide range of skin tones and hues among blacks, and that a dark-skinned black is not going to be viewed the same way as a light skinned black (by either blacks or whites), then she&rsquo;s too clueless to be educated at this point.</p>

Yes, I this definately true. Why would(in studies) innocent naive Black children want to play with White dolls instead of Black ones, given the choice? They learn to like their own race when they are older. <br>
I think beauty pagents should still be segregated - and they are for Black girls with the Black Miss America and others. Can we have a White Miss America? Of cource not. That would be racist! Almost anyone would agree that caucasian features - particularly Nordic ones as exemplified in the Scandanavian countries - are inherently more attractive than African features(kinky hair, pitch black skin, swollen lips, flat nose with flared nostrils etc.) Many, many, Blacks - particularly rich Black atheletes like Tiger Woods and O.J. Simpson - are examples who could have any girl and chose White ones. Sammy Davis, Jr. was one of the first Black entertainers in the U.S. who broke the color line by marrying the German actress Mae Britt under much controversy in the early 60&rsquo;s. He did this(against advice of his White friends like Sinatra) and caused quite a stir at the time because many states had LAWS against interracial marriage. The marriage didn&rsquo;t last for whatever reason. Maybe it was the disapproval he got wherever they went that caused the eventual breadup. </p>

<p><br>
&#8220;Anonymous&#8221;, you sound awfully defensive.  Why?  </p>
<p>Is it because you know that women don&rsquo;t get a nose jobs to <b>widen</b> their noses?  Or that many black women in America wear hairpieces made of Indian and Chinese hair, but never made of black African hair?  </p>
<p>Is it because you know that skin bleaching products are always top sellers in Africa? </p>
<p>&#8220;In Uganda, the practice of skin bleaching is common among adults with dark skin, especially women, but men also do it&#8221;  <br>
<a href="/news/2008/08/skin_bleaching.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/08/skin_bleaching.php</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are lighter, people pay more attention to you. It makes you more important and the rich men find you attractive,&rdquo;<br>

<p>As for your remarks about Robert De Niro, just the fact that you stretched to a 65 year old, semi-retired actor proves our point.  Fishing around for a handful of exceptions doesn&rsquo;t invalidate hard reality: <i>the majority</i> of people (of every race) prefer light skins over dark skins, and European-typical facial features over African-typical facial features.  </p>
<p>Go ask a plastic surgeon if you don&rsquo;t believe me!  <br>

			<p>I think this smacks of a deep seated perverse sexually driven inter-racial paedo-fantasy which why it is used to sell to africans, so where&rsquo;s the harm. I can&rsquo;t think of a single product or service promoted in UK which persuaded me to buy it just because africans were fronting the ad. Quite the opposite in fact.</p>

Yes, but that&rsquo;s always been the case with any White House children. Look at Chelsea Clinton. Look at Jenna and Whats-her-name. And Julie Nixon.  Luci  &amp; Lynda Johnson. The Kennedys. Anybody remember Margaret Truman? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s the package that comes with the job.  They knew the deal, and they took it.   You wanted to be First Family?  OK, fine,  then deal with it.  As they say, if you can&rsquo;t stand the heat, then stay out of the kitchen.</p>

			<p>Cute little Black girls??? Gimme a break! Cuteness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. I&rsquo;ll pass up supporting advertisers using Black models as much as possible. Nor would I waste money on magazines showing lots of Black models.</p>
<p>I stopped patronizing the movies for the same reason. I utterly REFUSE to subsidize the Hollywood Propaganda Industry&hellip; where every film has to have the obligatory Black best friends of the White hero. Coupled with the insanity of the Black)s) invariably being portrayed as smarter, braver, nicer than the Whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;These companies/programs/agencies/etc&hellip; that are pushing for this &ldquo;the ethnic look is equal to or better than the blonde look&rdquo; are only digging their own graves.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only digging their own graves if their audiences are majority white. They are at the moment, but that isn&rsquo;t going to last much longer. The &#8220;ethnic look&#8221; is the wave of the future.</p>

			<p>The solution is simple.  Complain that we are underepresented and don&rsquo;t buy from those companies.  We really need to start our own trends anyway and stop buying into the ethinic propoganda.  Personally I would love to see all White people dress and behave like they used to when appearance and manners meant something. </p>

A solid post indeed,it should become clearer to all that the elite are pushing for a &#8220;tan everyman society&#8221; world wide,diversity is displacement leading to replacement,leading to the destruction of our race,the endgame,rampant miscegination,to blend us away,if this does not work,they can always disarm us,and then fill our cities with non-whites who carry a grudge against us because of the color of our skin,and our great accomplishments,when the population numbers are right,perhaps entitlement programs will be cut back,or ended,in the U.S.,then that mean old Whitey can be dealt with!</p>

<p>Most black people are going to buy black whether they think the little black girls are more attractive or not.  Cute defines a very broad spectrum.  Except for the majority whites, most minorities vote, think, and breathe race.  And, that is why they are pandered to and that is what is driving Madison Avenue.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I do love the fact that modeling agencies are now being forced to hire more black girls&#8221; </p>
<p>Forced? The world of fashion plays hardball aparently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how when they do a story on how black is beautiful the media (granted this is just a fashion blog) has to &#8216;lighten&rsquo; the subjects in photoshop to make their point.</p>
<p>This is the photo used in this article (note no heads of other people, because when you adjust contrast or light levels it&rsquo;ll make already white features &#8216;beam&rsquo; whiteness).   <br>

<p>And this quote from the original source article<br>
&hellip;..&#8221;Ad agencies are scrambling to find child models who resemble first daughters Malia and Sasha Obama. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a very specific age and a very specific ethnicity,&#8221; and allegedly hard to find&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;a very specific ethnicity&#8221;.<br>
(Good luck on getting those compatible bone marrow/organ donors if need be).<br>
For the record I prefer it when people of &#8216;color&rsquo; have someone of &#8216;their own&rsquo; to gaze upon in the media. But in this case it&rsquo;s the manipulation I resent, the twisting of truth to try and please(market to/brainwash) everybody.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When will it end? Has anyone watched the Miss Universe pageants of recent years?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, but I remember the last time I watched Miss America.  When they got down to the last five finalists, four of them were nonwhite.  The only white girl, Miss California, was the first of the five to be eliminated.  I switched it off at that point and haven&rsquo;t watched since then.  I remember thinking to myself, &#8220;Do whites make up only one-fifth of the population of the United States?&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think so, and this was several years ago.</p>
<p>Every time I see a commercial with some saintly, brilliant black person in it, (and especially if the ad also includes a dumb, clueless white,) I think, &#8220;Well, I guess they don&rsquo;t want white customers&#8221; and make a mental note not to buy the product.  Maybe all whites should start doing the same.</p>

			<p>Thanks, Gen X, for those photo shots. That first shot especially (which I had seen before) not only shows their skin very noticeably lightened more so than in the other shots, but also I note that their hair has been straintened&gt;  It furthermore appears to have been given reddish/blond highlights.  I can&rsquo;t believe this is their natural hair color!   And while adults may tint their hair, i&rsquo;ve never seen this done on such young children before.</p>

<p><i>Yes, but that&rsquo;s always been the case with any White House children. Look at Chelsea Clinton. Look at Jenna and Whats-her-name. And Julie Nixon. Luci &amp; Lynda Johnson. The Kennedys. Anybody remember Margaret Truman?</i></p>
<p>I grew up during the Clinton years, and as I recall Chelsea was pretty much left alone. So were the Bush girls, except when they were out getting drunk while underage. Everyone else you mentioned was before my time, but I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb and assume that no dolls were being made of them within a week of their dads assuming the presidency.</p>
<p>Also, if Mrs. Obama is complaining about the dolls, then it&rsquo;s a safe bet that Ty isn&rsquo;t paying any royalties to the girls for use of their names and likenesses. </p>

			<p>The original story is actually on some lesbian website, not a fashion blog. As far as marketing, this is a perfect realm to practice low-intensity battle. I don&rsquo;t buy a product featuring a black model at all. I made this decision AFTER I started to realized WHO was behind putting those black models on all of those products. That is why I was delighted to read the story about ad agencies being hounded to hire more blacks in corporate positions. Everybody behind the lens in the marketing chain is white and they choose to put blacks in front of the camera. Let them pay the price of their hip attitudes.</p>

			<p>Hi all, Im into weight lifting alot so I like to buy the weight lifting magzines.  In the last two years I noticed that they started to feature more and more blacks on the covers and through out the magazine.  Some of the magazines I used to like to buy have almost gone completely black now.  I will not buy them anylonger.  Its ok if it only once and a while (but never would be better).  I have made up my mind now that I will not buy, attend, watch anything with blacks in it more than once in a while.  I know of other who feel the same way.  Just the other day a Korean guy here at work commented that you can&rsquo;t watch T.V. at all with out a black in it some how.<br>
I will not watch obama at all on T.V. and neither will my roomate.  The second that he appears on the screen my roomate can&rsquo;t tolerate it at all.  I have had enough of this now more than ever before. But just how far will this go?</p>

<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think we should say positive things about being white, white cultures, white ethnicities and white achievements.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should mention the downsides of other tribes.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I think we should all practice this phrase:</p>
<p>&#8220;History shows us that multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>If anyone dissents, ask for a list of successful examples of multicultural societies.</p>

<p>Telling the truth, my friend, is not for the purpose of securing adherents.  In fact, most people on here are not trying to increase our numbers by what they say.  They&rsquo;re making a valid point which is usually reinforced with facts.</p>
<p>This is not a recruitment center, however, we do welcome more whites.  What brings most whites to this site and to our cause is waking up to the facts that we present or those presented by the select stories we comment on on this forum.</p>
<p>As the situation grows worse and non-white animosity becomes more apparent, whites will come in droves.  In the meantime, just mentioning white injustices and/or displaying egregious non-white actions and behavior turn a lot of whites into white nationalists whether they&rsquo;re on this site or not. </p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter who thinks these girls are cute.  What matters is how the media will elevate this black nationalist family to icon status and use them as role models for whites.  The problem with white nationalism isn&rsquo;t how some whites prefer whites; the problem is that its members are too concerned with political correctness.  <br>

			<p>Well, I certainly don&rsquo;t read NY magazine so I can&rsquo;t comment on the racial breakdown of their models, but if it&rsquo;s similar to what we see on TV and in most print media one would assume that the country&rsquo;s at least 40% black and that all blacks are upper-upper middle class.  Strangely, despite their ostensible socio-economic status, they all persist in speaking ghetto Blacklish in the TV commercials.</p>
<p>Were I a black actor/model for these commercials I&rsquo;d insist on speaking normal English.  Coming off like some jive-talking ghetto dweller is not exactly the message I&rsquo;d want to convey.  Ah, but the agency creative types know best.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What do you all think &mdash; another positive outcome from the Obama election, another depressing sign of America&rsquo;s obsession with consumerism, or proof that we still have a long way to go to achieve true racial equality? (Or all three?)&#8221;</p>
<p>It is simply proof that White children, and White women are more attractive naturally than the darker ones.  Not only that, but the White ones have features that are more endearing naturally than others.  As for White men, commercialism and other aspects of society have been manipulated for decades as the drive to supplant them with darker skinned visions of male attractiveness has had some success.  &#8220;Tall, dark and hansome&#8221; used to mean a White man with darker hair and a tan, but still piercing blue eyes - now it means, Black. </p>
<p>Now, they are hoping to work on White children, hoping to make mixed race children more disireable by splicing it into Obamamania.  White women being the clear winners in international disireability &#8220;polls&#8221; - those &#8220;polls&#8221; being a suggested sampling of how many non-White men date/marry White women in an effort to produce Whiter children.</p>

			<p>Brett Stevens is right on the money. </p>
<p>Every other month Hollywood comes out a new movie lauding the magical black man. I turn on the television this morning and see a commerical for the new magical black man movie &#8220;The Soloist.&#8221; Jamie Foxx is some gifted homeless violinist living in a car when a white lawyer discovers his hidden talent. </p>
<p>While &#8220;The Soloist&#8221; can be interpretted as simply a story of an underdog, there is a more subtle broader pattern of popular hollywood movies portraying secretly gifted black men rising to fame despite society&rsquo;s prejudice. Even commericals for cellphones, TVs, clothing etc have a well spoken black man guiding buffoonish white customers or co-workers. </p>
<p>I believe the author of this article is truely mystified at the lack of spectacular black people to model for products. Where are these beautiful, intelligent, gifted black people we see so often in fictional tv ads or movies?</p>

These companies/programs/agencies/etc&hellip; that are pushing for this &ldquo;the ethnic look is equal to or better than the blonde look&rdquo; are only digging their own graves. </p>
<p>The irony is, in majority non-white countries the women in front of the camera are always as white looking as possible. Telemundo has an incredible amount of blonds. Many of them are European looking blonds, and those that aren&rsquo;t as European, often are Hispanic women trying to look more European with bleached blonde hair.</p>

<p>Interesting. I was into weight lifting years ago. As I recall, I don&rsquo;t remember EVER seeing blacks in those magazines back them.  It was not a black activity. Neither were they in tennis, for instance. Nor in golf. One by one, each sport has fallen to them. And each time, it&rsquo;s hailed in the press as some sort of a wonderful achievement.

How prophetic was that cover, years ago? Just recently I went to pick up my 13 yr. old tall blonde handsome son at his school and I easily spotted him in a sea of foriegn races. He truely stuck out like a sore thumb. I sat in my car as he approached and I couldn&rsquo;t help but think,is this truly the destiny of the white race? Is this the fate of the greatest people the earth has ever known? Where did we go wrong? How did we let this happen? I hugged my son a lot that evening.He and all our children are our only hope for our future survival. &#8220;Teach your children well&#8221;</p>

<p>Explain, Herr von Herstberg, what you mean. We have the RIGHT (free speech) to tell the truth about non-Whites. If you read our posts, you must realize that non-Whites (Blacks, Hispanics) happen to commit the MOST crimes, particularly violent crimes, in our country. Your problem seems to be one of being AFRAID to tell the truth; German laws having been enacted to stiffle public speech about non-White crimes and criminals.</p>
<p>By the way, some months ago, you took us Americans to task for not WANTING Obama in the White House. Yet now you&rsquo;re claiming to be &#8220;a White nationalist&#8221;. Something does not compute. If you claim to be a w.n., you would hardly want Blacks to rule over you, right? I responded to your post at the time calling our country &#8220;racist&#8221;, but you carefully avoided making a reply. So reading your latest post, why do I get the feeling (impression) you are less than honest?</p>

			<p>Dark skinned people have coarse, broad facial features.  Ad agencies can usually adapt by hiring mixed race models (think Lisa Bonet) and injecting their lips with collagen. Unfortunately, there are a shortage of kids with parents willing to have their kids surgically enhanced at age 8 to match what amounts to a universal standard of beauty.

			<p>I have to agree with JoeMixedBloodIndian.  The second Obama&rsquo;s face appears on TV at our house, the channel gets changed.  We don&rsquo;t watch the news, unless someone is manning the remote.</p>
<p>As for magazines, I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any.  There&rsquo;s not much to do around Jackson, Mississippi, so picking the most appealing maggies at Books-A-Million or Borders (the music at Barnes &amp; Noble is too obnoxious&hellip;we darkened their doorstep for the last time when they bombarded us with The Jackson Five)&hellip;.well, it&rsquo;s something to do&hellip;. If a magazine cover has a man with greazy hair, someone with a cigarette, or a black, I will not buy that issue&hellip;.even if there&rsquo;s an article inside I&rsquo;m dying to read.  I have to wonder how many subscribers Vanity Fair had left, after devoting a whole issue to Africa.</p>
<p>But the Obama girls really are cute as buttons.  Pity.  Maybe if they were less adorable, big B.O. might not have been elected.</p>

			<p>Fed Up:</p>
<p>I am white race realist and I agree with Maxmillian, at times there are a nubmer of comments on this board are over the top.</p>
<p>You know it amuses me. It seems that whenever someone disagrees with certain posters or takes a view that is critical of the excesses of some of our posters, they are automatically assumed to be a Black, Latino, White liberal or other person. This is paranoid, myopic foolshenss at best</p>
<p>I remember WR The Elder being accused of being Black last year by another poster which was false.</p>
<p>The fact is that our movement is marginalized enough as it is and it is certainly not helping our cause by engaging in outlandish foolish behavior such as attacking two innocnent little girls. Even some other posters have made this point. </p>
<p>If we as race realists do not get a better handle on how to change what is now for the most part, our negative public image as a bunch of outlandiah,fringe yahoos and convinve many more Whites that our survival as a race is at stake, then we are are all but doomed as a people. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, but that&rsquo;s always been the case with any White House children. Look at Chelsea Clinton. Look at Jenna and Whats-her-name. And Julie Nixon. Luci &amp; Lynda Johnson. The Kennedys. Anybody remember Margaret Truman?&#8221;</p>
<p>No President ever used his children as blatantly as did Kennedy.  His brothers also used their children, even more than Pres Kennedy did, especially the disgusting Robert Kennedy family of druggies and drunks.</p>
<p>I was in high school in the late fifties when the Kennedy pr machine swung into full gear for the 1960 race.  They were as blatant and vulgar as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in using their children for publicity purposes.</p>
<p>My parents subscribed to 10 or 12 national magazines.  Several were the women&rsquo;s magazines, most of the rest were news magazines like Atlantic, Time etc.  I well remember that the women&rsquo;s magazines especially were filled with Kennedy children, and this was a couple years before he became President.  I remember Caroline and Jackie on magazine covers when Caroline was a baby and toddler.</p>
<p>About a year before the election one national magazine, not a women&rsquo;s magazine had a full color picture of 2 year old Caroline on the cover.</p>
<p>Then when he became President the kids were all over the media.  Even at 17 I realized the hycoprisy. First would be an article about how Jackie was so extremely protective of her children&rsquo;s privacy.  Next month would be pages and pages of her children.</p>
<p>The Obama&rsquo;s kept their children&rsquo;s privacy right up to the last few months of the campaign.  Good for them.  That&rsquo;s one way they are already better than the unspeakable Kennedys.</p>

			<p>I remember in the 1960&rsquo;s seeing Jackie Kennedy&rsquo;s face on EVERY magazine dealing with the motion picture industry. This happened long after JFK&rsquo;s assassination. I never could figure out why, since Jackie was no professional Hollywood actress.</p>

<p>I do agree in part. But I do not believe I&rsquo;ve said anything against the Obama kids in my comments. My point was that we have the right to air crimes by Blacks and Hispanic minority members. Something strictly VERBOTEN in Germany. I also agree we need to leave the Obama kids alone. But PULEEZE, don&rsquo;t bombard us with puke-inducing advertising in the future with &#8220;cute&#8221; little black kids in every page of every magazine, or those nauseating TV sit/com-type commercials.</p>
<p>I concede I jumped to the automatic conclusion &#8220;rational thinker&#8221; is Black. Simply because I can&rsquo;t picture the most befuddled White liberalist spouting his kind of nonsense. I agree, live the Obama kids alone. But do not try to convince me I have to regard them as cute or anything else. I said it earlier: Cuteness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. A world of truth in that simple sentence!</p>

			<p>Ad agencies shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to feature black girls just because Sasha and Malia are now America&rsquo;s First Family.  That move smacks of political correctness ideology that is rampant in America today.  People have a right to their own aesthetic tastes not encombered by PC.  </p>

<p>I fully concur with you on that.  I will be very pleased not even to see the &#8220;adorable First Family&#8221; for the next four years.</p>

			<p>Yesterday I was browsing in a magazine store at the airport.  It seemed that Pres. Obama or the Obama family were on the covers of every other magazine!  And there was a whole section of books devoted to The Obamas.  Enough already!</p>
