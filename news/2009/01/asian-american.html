<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090118/Asian.American.Politics/">Asian-American Political Profile Rising in US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Jan. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is fitting that San Francisco, which is 34 percent Asian and home of the nation&rsquo;s oldest Chinatown, is leading the way on Asian-American political representation. But the country&rsquo;s fastest growing minority group also is reaching new heights on the state and national stage.</p>
<p>Experts say their newfound clout is not due to numbers alone.</p>
<p>The political engagement of Asian-Americans is growing. Many immigrants are earning citizenship. Community organizations are mounting voter registration drives. Ethnic media increasingly are endorsing candidates and covering political campaigns. And politicians are scoring victories, even in areas without a strong Asian electorate.</p>
<p>Countrywide, there are more than 2,000 Asian and Pacific Islander elected and appointed representatives, according to UCLA&rsquo;s Asian American Studies Center. In California, Asian-Americans hold two seats in the state Senate, 10 in the Assembly, plus the posts of state controller and chief of the Board of Equalization. A decade ago, there was only one high-ranking Asian-American official, the state treasurer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Asian-American population has expanded from 0.5 percent in 1960  &mdash;  prior to repeal of restrictive immigration laws  &mdash;  to 5 percent now. The U.S. Census projects they will grow to 8 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>A push by voter education groups to turn new citizens into voters has helped make this ethnic group a political force in California, where their numbers are largest.</p>
<p>Making an impact on the national ballot box remains a greater challenge. Asian-Americans are scattered geographically, and they are still a predominantly immigrant group, with only about two out of three of them citizens. They are underrepresented politically, holding a smaller proportion of elected positions than their share of the population.</p>
<p>Many people of Asian descent have stepped beyond their national identities to develop a pan-Asian perspective, giving both money and votes to Asian-American candidates who might not share their national origin, according to Don Nakanishi, director of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center.</p>
<p>That has translated into victories at the local level, where Asian-American politicians are poised for higher office. &#8220;People are moving up  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s happening very quickly,&#8221; said C.C. Yin, a businessman who helped found the Asian Pacific Islander American Political Association, which nurtures future leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That need also was apparent in Louisiana where voters elected Republican U.S. Rep. Anh &#8220;Joseph&#8221; Cao last year, making him the first Vietnamese-American in Congress. His victory followed the election of Bobby Jindal, a son of Punjabi immigrants, to Congress and then to the governorship in 2007.</p>
<p>The election of Barack Obama and his consideration of several Asian-Americans for high-profile positions also serve as incentives for Asian-Americans to jump into politics, said Nakanishi.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Obama, it&rsquo;s not unthinkable that a guy like Jindal could become president some day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is still a lot pioneering going on, but Asian-Americans are really becoming an even more viable and visible actor in American politics.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Cao is a Republican, you can be sure, of the George W Bush mold. His prior job was as an immigration lawyer, and he has spent much time engaged in Vietnamese ethnic cheerleading.</p>

			<p>The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act during the eighteen hundreds was a wonderfull event. Native Born Whites were protected for decades from racial and economic dispossession at the hands of LEGAL asian immigrants. The passage of the 1965 immigration act took away this protection.</p>
<p>In 2009 there is a defacto Native Born White Exclusion act anywhere in America where asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; are numerous. I say:Bring back the Chinese Exclusion Act&hellip;as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; are actively participating in the racial and economic dispossession of Native Born White Americans. It is for this reason that I will not financially support Numbersusa.com which has whited out Native Born White Americans at the numbersusa  website. Your hard earned money should be sent  to American Renassaince. </p>
<p>If you voted Republican -year in and year out-you voted for the complete racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans within the borders of the United States. Ignorance and stupidity are no excuse for voting for the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans at the hands of post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>Bring Back the Chinese Exclusion Act!!!!</p>

			<p>Just because they are elected to office is not a problem. The question is whether they will be &ldquo;activist&rdquo;?</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to assume that almost all non-whites are activists for their own group.  </p>

			<p>Asians never forget who they are.  Once their numbers reach critical mass, the ethnic pride swells, as does the contempt for minority whites.  </p>
<p>They are well aware that whites are a minority race, and they stand a chance of inheriting all we have.</p>

			<p>I am a second-generation Asian American born in the US, and am entrenched in American culture.  In fact, my generation carries very few remnants of Asian culture, and identity solely as American.  You may see this trend continue as time goes on.  My father fought in Vietnam  &mdash;  can&rsquo;t get more patriotic than that.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;economic dispossession&#8221; addressed above, my parents came to the US in the 1950s with $5 in their pockets, worked hard, and now 50 years later have built a 15 million dollar nest egg; They succeeded by neither &#8220;dispossessing&#8221; others nor being &#8220;dispossessed,&#8221; but by doing business through cooperation with all Americans.  They have contributed to America&rsquo;s GDP, not their native country in Asia.  All that while assimilating into American culture and exhibiting American patriotism.</p>
