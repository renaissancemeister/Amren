<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Medgar Evers College is one of many City University of New York (CUNY) campuses with an open admissions policy. This means it accepts anyone from anywhere who has the equivalent of a high school diploma, and therefore does not attract smart, ambitious students. Both the faculty and student body are overwhelmingly black, and this produces an &#8220;academic&#8221; environment receptive to unusual claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would the world be like without black people?&#8221; began a speech to students by the college&rsquo;s Provost, Kofi Lomotey, which was broadcast over New York City educational television in January. Mr. Lomotey was recounting &#8220;Theo&rsquo;s Story,&#8221; about the many things we take for granted in our lives that would never have existed had they not been invented by black people.</p>
<p>Theo&rsquo;s mother explains to him that without the crucial contributions of black people he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to brush his hair, wear shoes, write a letter, or have a clean floor.</p>
<p>Theo learns that blacks with American names invented the comb, hair brush, dustpan, mop, shoe making machine, clothes dryer, pencil sharpener, fountain pen, typewriter, lawn mower, automobile, automatic transmission, traffic light, refrigerator, air conditioner, elevator, mail drop box, and many other things. Theo  &mdash;  and the students of Medgar Evers College  &mdash;  also learn that a black was the first to perform open-heart surgery.</p>
<p>Presumably, Chinese royalty of more than 2,000 years ago were without combs and brushes since it was African Americans who invented them. Also, given that hair brushes for people with soft, straight hair are not much use on kinky African hair, all non-blacks should be grateful to Liddy O&rsquo;Newman, the black woman who allegedly invented hair brushes suitable for white people.</p>
<p>Likewise, the ancient Greeks and Romans must always have had dirty floors, since mops and brooms had not yet been invented by American blacks. But even assuming that blacks really had invented some of these things, it&rsquo;s hard to understand why a people would be so proud to have invented the dustpan. It is impossible to imagine an Italian or a Frenchman crowing that his people had invented the ashtray or the spittoon.</p>
<p>Why even bother to call some of these things inventions? A mail drop box is hardly a monumental breakthrough, and someone would sooner or later have come up with something to serve its purpose.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it is not easy to find out who invented the lawn mower or the pencil sharpener, but I did research some of the things Mr. Lomotey mentions and not one was invented by a black. Alexander Miles did not invent the elevator  &mdash;  or anything else as far as I can tell. The first elevator with an automatic safety device to prevent it from falling if the cable snapped was designed and installed by Elisha Graves Otis in 1852.</p>
<p>It was a German engineer Carl von Linden, not the black John Standard who in 1876 patented the process of liqui-fying gas that is a basic refrigeration technology. Stuart Cramer and Willis Carrier invented the air conditioner in 1906. In the 1920s Swedish engineers Carl Munters and Baltaz von Platen introduced refrigeration without moving parts. Mr. Lomotey&rsquo;s Fred Jones seems to have had nothing to do with any of these things. I was unable to find a reference to Dr. Daniel Hale Williams as the first open-heart surgeon, though the <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite> lists 20 other pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>That an administrator at a state-funded college should get away with outright fabrications is a logical consequence of open admissions and affirmative action. If there are essentially no standards, the only yardstick is fidelity to an agenda.</p>
<p>A different example of what has replaced standards is the large number of non-white New York City public schools that are deliberately staffed with non-white teachers. Many of them were &#8220;socially promoted,&#8221; or passed on to the next grade despite failing work, and are not certified to teach. They can take the certification test over and over, and more than 400 teachers have failed four, five, even six years in a row  &mdash;  but still get satisfactory evaluations as teachers. They are satisfactory because they are the right race and promote the right racial message.</p>
<p>Medgar Evers College was sending the same message on Nov. 20, 1999, when it sponsored a six-hour forum on the PBS television series, <cite>Wonders of the African World.</cite> The host of the panel Clinton Crawford and historian Jack Felder appeared in African costumes for discussions that were once again televised. (It is amusing to see blacks in the alleged attire of their ancestors  &mdash;  most of whom actually wore nothing to speak of. One never sees spokesmen for Mexico in sombreros and ponchos, and even ambassadors from African countries wear suits and ties.)</p>
<p>Mr. Felder said he had a Ph.D. and teaches in the New York City school system. He said the PBS series, which already pushes credibility with its claims for African accomplishment, is really only a hint of real black prowess. He called the author of the series, Henry Louis Gates of Harvard, a &#8220;Negro,&#8221; which Mr. Felder defined as a false black co-opted to serve white interests. He criticized Mr. Gates for proposing that black Africans ruled Egypt for only 150 years and insisted that blacks established Egypt 13,500 years ago and ruled it throughout the period of the pharaohs.</p>
<p>Mr. Felder also reported that King James of England had the Bible translated into English by William Shakespeare. The proof is to be found in Shakespeare&rsquo;s signature in Psalm 46. Verse three contains the words &#8220;the mountains shake&#8221; and verse nine the words &#8220;cutteth the spear in sunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Felder also announced what he called a &#8220;bombshell,&#8221; revealing that although this fact has been obliterated from &#8220;whitewashed&#8221; history books, the first president of the United States was a black man, John Hanson. Hanson, explained Mr. Felder, is shown on the two-dollar bill along with Benjamin Banneker, the early black surveyor and almanac writer. On the back of the bill there is an engraving of John Trumbull&rsquo;s painting, &#8220;The Signing of the Declaration of Independence,&#8221; which portrays the signers. Neither Hanson, Banneker, nor any black is among them.</p>
<p>John Hanson did represent Maryland in the Continental Congress and in 1781 was elected &#8220;President of the United States in Congress Assembled,&#8221; an office he held for one year. He is sometimes referred to as &#8220;the first president of the United States,&#8221; but he was a congressional presiding officer and had none of the powers of the president under the Constitution, which was not ratified until 1787.</p>
<p>That much is easy enough to find out, but it is not so easy to prove that a relatively obscure historical figure was not black. The readily-available books on the revolutionary period are silent as to Hanson&rsquo;s race. Fortunately, I came across a book on the colonial history of Charles County, Maryland, where John Hanson lived (<cite>The Price of Nationhood: the American Revolution in Charles County,</cite> by Jean B. Lee, 1994). It mentions Hanson&rsquo;s problem with a runaway slave in 1782, but that is not proof of whiteness, since there were a few free blacks who held slaves. The book contains no portrait of John Hanson, but it does have one of his brother, Samuel  &mdash;  who is white.</p>
<p>It is unlikely, of course, that any student at Medgar Evers College would ever look into what Mr. Felder was claiming, and if he did, would probably only conclude that any suggestion Hanson was white was just part of the great cover-up of black accomplishment. The students were doubtless convinced Mr. Felder was brilliantly exposing &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Mr. Felder said blacks must be educated by other blacks. He said America is not going to encourage the development of an African historian because &#8220;to make a true African historian is to make an enemy.&#8221; It is good that this man, who considers himself a true African historian, had the candor to admit he is an enemy of America. Of course, the media, the politicians, and the liberals will never admit that Mr. Felder and Medgar Evers College are enemies. No matter how many riots, gang rapes, murders, carjackings and muggings there are; no matter how many tax dollars are spent to support welfare mothers and criminals, no matter how many absurd lies are told about our history and culture, whites will always be at fault and must suffer the consequences. We can consider this the new white man&rsquo;s burden.</p>
<p>Provost Lomotey feels no embarrassment in boosting the self-esteem of his people with fictional accounts of history. The students at Medgar Evers College  &mdash;  as well as those of many other CUNY campuses  &mdash;  will graduate thinking that half the world&rsquo;s geniuses were black and that today&rsquo;s civilization owes its existence to the efforts of Africans. They will believe that the &#8220;white man&#8221; has conspired to hide African accomplishments as part of his effort to &#8220;subjugate&#8221; blacks. New York City is, indeed, educating enemies of the people who built this country. Given that forces are at work that will reduce whites to a minority in 40 or 50 years, we can expect that the racial and political agenda of New York City  &mdash;  now one of the biggest populations of Third-World people on earth  &mdash;  will become the national agenda.<br/>

			<p>I left New York over a decade-and-a-half ago, and if you really want to see what life will be like as a minority in the United States, visit New York after dark.  Or, during the Puerto Rican Day parade or the Afro-Carribean Day parade  Consider it a crash course in primal survival.  Many whites starting leaving the area after the second world war.  With the influx of minorities and white liberals, it&rsquo;s been a lost cause for many, many years.  Sad, because it truly was one of the most exciting and vibrant cities I have ever visisted or lived in.  It literally could breath life into you.  It was a work of art and one of the best examples of western culture.  But, no more and most likely never again.<br/>

<p>I have seen blacks talk about &#8220;Our first black president John Hanson&#8221; over the internet. The funny thing is there are several  images of different black men, they like to claim was John Hanson. What&rsquo;s laughable is, two of the most popular are photographs, not paintings! They are old, but were likely taken from the post civil war era. I guess nobody is supposed to be aware that there were no cameras in the 1700&rsquo;s. Of course, they would probably insist they were available to the black community then because some enterprising African American had already invented it.</p>
<p>Here are the two photos of the black John Hanson</p>

			<p>The reason the liberals have to introduce fantastic fairy tales to the black community to artificially enhance their self esteem is because of the black man&rsquo;s desperately low intelligence. With an average IQ of 85, nearly a full standard deviation from the mean, blacks lack the intellectual resources to succeed in a white society, yet they have been led - cruelly and unfairly - to consider themselves to be equals. Unfortunately this lie is what will always keep them suffering. Only when blacks forget their preposterous dreams of getting a college degree on their own intellectual merits, or of holding down anything other than a menial job without affirmative action quotas will there be any kind of racial harmony.</p>

			<p>When I taught in an all black public school, we had the standard black history month falsehoods and fantasies.  I remember that the idiot black female &#8220;PHD&#8221; who gave one of the talks claimed that Africans invented braiding hair.</p>
<p>Obviously, hair braiding was invented thousands of years ago.s.  It was most probably invented by an ethnic group that has long straight hair, either Whites or Asians.  American Indians wore their hair in braids long before they met any Africans.</p>
<p>Another myth is that an American black laundress invented something called the &#8220;mangle&#8221;  For those of us who only know about electric clothes dryers, a mangle was a system of rollers.  The dripping wet clothes from the wash tubs were passed through the rollers.  The rollers squeezed out most of the water, so the clothes didn&rsquo;t take so much time to dry on the laundry lines. Like the spin cycle, mangles saved a lot of time.</p>
<p>I was in the Art section of a big college library looking through books of medieval European manuscripts.  I saw some pictures of peasant life with people working at various chores. Some of the women were doing laundry. They had wash tubs, clothes lines and something that was clearly a mangle.  One woman was turning the handle and another was pushing a piece of wet wash through the mangle.  The picture was painted in the 1300&rsquo;s, long before any blacks lived in America.</p>

			<p>This article made me think of the quip of Prof. Walter Williams (who is himself black) in response to his acquaintances&rsquo; claim that the white man &#8220;stole&#8221; math, science and technology from blacks: &#8220;If that&rsquo;s so, why can&rsquo;t our young people steal it <i>back</i> then?&#8221;</p>

<p>That one could be true&hellip;&hellip;.. with his stone age spear, while he was reducing the number of his enemies.</p>
<p>These lies are putting these people at a definite handicap as much as cult members who are indoctrinated with inane things that are nonsense and untrue.  In fact Afrocentrism is almost exactly like a cult or sect of true believers.  Blacks are already at a disadvatage by having a lower group intelligence average than any of the other races.  Instilling in them complete nonsensical fabrications is just going to assure they won&rsquo;t be able to cope in the real world.</p>
<p>However, whether it&rsquo;s something like this or believing that they will be wealthy and in control of the country now that a black is president says more about their lack of fitness for competing in a first world country than their low I.Q. scores.</p>

			<p>Speaking of important blacks who have been expunged from the history books, why doesn&rsquo;t Medgar Evers College teach about black African Antoine Johnson, the very first slave holder in America?</p>
<p>Slavery in the early colonies, like school busing,  affirmative action, excessive rights for criminals and other numerous evils was accomplished through Judicial rulings after interested parties filed lawsuits intended to either to create, cast down or change existing laws.</p>
<p>For the first 30 years, Colonial Virginia had no provision for slavery.  Employment law was current English law which provided for indentured servants who contracted themselves to work for a specific employer for 7 years.  The 7 years came from the Old Testament, ancient Jewish law that forbade indentured servitude for more than 7 years.</p>
<p>Antoine Johnson employed several black and white indentured servants.  One of the blacks tried to break away from Johnson&rsquo;s abuse.  He asked another colonist, a white man to buy him out of his contract with Johnson.</p>
<p>Johnson filed a lawsuit claiming that indentured servants could become life long slaves if their masters so wished.  The Judge ruled in Johnson&rsquo;s favor and thus slavery was established in colonial Virginia by Judicial fiat in the 1630&rsquo;s.  It was not till the 1660&rsquo;s that the Virginia legislature legalized slavery.</p>
<p>Antoine Johnson was on of the black Africans who arrived from Angola in that year of infamy, 1619.</p>
<p>Or Medgar Evers College could teach about the thousands of black and mullatto slaveholders who fled Haiti with their black slaves after the revolution and ended up in Louisianna. Their grandchildren still owned the grand children of the slaves until the end of the Civil War.</p>
<p>When I read articles like this I am happy about the invasion of Asian, Middle Eastern, Indian and Hispanic immigrants.  They are elbowing the blacks away from the affirmative action trough.</p>

			<p>I have read that while George Washington was the first President under the United States Constitution, it is a little-known fact that John Hanson was the first President under the Articles of Confederation.  However, to everyone reading this post, if I am historically inacurrate as to what I have stated, please correct me.</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing is certain.  There is no way that John Hanson could have been, even a free black, and be able to serve in any kind of public office during the 18th century!  As far as I know, in the 18th Century, even to be able to vote, you had to, at least, be a free, non-indentured, white, Protestant, male of 21.  Many of the colonies even required property ownership, as another requirement to be able to vote.</p>
<p>There was a far different attitude back then.  In the 18th and 19th Centuries, even many opponents of slavery where against full and equal rights for those who were not white, Protestant males.</p>
<p>In this day and age, one day while visiting New York City, I encountered a group of blacks on the street, dressed in strange clothes, whose leader ranted and raved, &#8220;Everything that was invented, was invented by a black man!&#8221;  The leader of this anti-white, racist, religious cult then quoted the Bible, out of context, to claim there is a coming apocaplypse in which the white man will be wiped off the face of the Earth.  This was when I was almost near Penn Station, on the way to catch my train back to Philadelphia.  So, as a white person, I was not any danger by being in the wrong section of New York City.  However, I know this group of racist blacks did not like my stopping by to listen to them.  And I am sure this anti-white cult does not accept any white, or other non-black, converts!   </p>

<p>By nature most Afrocentric minded blacks are virulently anti-white. What better way to get back at white culture, than to claim all of their accomplishments were really stolen off blacks? But in the long run, most of them come off more anti non-black than anything else. Most Afrocentrists claim they were the originators of China&rsquo;s early dynasties, and that Muhammad was actually a black man, and that the Olmec heads of Mexico were of black kings that the people worshipped. Of course, they also claim the all Egyptian royals were black. And they also claim Buddha was a black man as well. So in short, they became quite greedy, and decided to claim all cultures outside their own. They especially love to claim all royal and religious figures were black. Most likely I believe, because so many of them have this need to be worshipped.</p>

			<p>Afro-centric history and claims of African inventions and their technological superiority always revert to claims going back thousands of years, with the preaching of how ancient Europeans had to go to Africa for knowledge, etc. The adherents of how advanced Africans were millenia ago always fall silent when you ask the simple question &#8220;What happened to the intellectually superior Africans 5,000 years ago that caused Africa to become so backwards and savage&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Anytime I hear blacks complain how whites(Greeks and Romans)stole math and science, along with other inventions from the <br/>
Africans, it reminds me how the Russians stole atom bomb secrets from the United States.  It never prevented the U.S. from producing future atomic weapons.  You can steal knowledge from others, but they still retain that knowledge.  Either they had a lousy memory, because they never invented a written language, or these Afrocentrists have to make things up to make themselves feel equal to the other races who have made real contributions to the world.  </p>

			<p>Seems to me that blacks confuse patents with inventions, Edison invented the light bulb and also had many patents on it. Adding longer hoses in a &#8220;Gas-mask&#8221; dosen&rsquo;t mean you invented it. The first &#8220;Stop signal&#8221; was probably somebody just holding their hand up to stop other foot traffic coming the other direction. </p>

			<p>Yes, the specious idea that whites stole all kinds of technology and sciences from blacks in africa and took them to europe with them is a cliche of black history revisionists.   How does one go about stealing &#8216;calculus&rsquo; from a people?  They wrongly think of these concepts as &#8216;secret recipes&rsquo; that once stolen are gone forever from the people who developed them.</p>
<p>If an invading tribe had gone into, say, China, and stolen all the gunpowder and all the &#8216;written recipes&rsquo; for it, do you honestly think the Chinese would have just sat  there scratching their heads wondering how they&rsquo;d ever make any more?</p>
<p>One thing is certain, though  &mdash;  now that whites have left Detroit and taken their own car manufacturing technology with them, the blacks who now occupy the city do not have the ability to build a car themselves, even after having worked in the factories for generations.  That tells you everything you need to know.</p>

			<p>Truly amazing is how such an advanced race (Africans) could be subjugated by know-nothing Europeans and forced into slavery.  Where was the black McGyver to free his people with a clever laser firing space ship built with parts from a cotton bag and some chains?</p>

			<p>To anonymous who stated that sentence about Detroit&hellip;.you are right, the blacks can&rsquo;t even build a kiddie car. My cousin works for an auto manufacturing plant up in Michigan, and he said every black who, and I use the word lossley&hellip;..works there, is as lazy as they come, they don&rsquo;t HAVE to work, are catered too, as they get away with sitting down on the job, coming in drunk, taking days off or leaving in the middle of the shift, and acting out at work.  They are sacred cows, and not a damn thing anyone does about it!!! Their union protects them, and someone who really does work, has to pick up their slack, like it or not!! This also goes for those blacks put into colleges, and I say put in, not smart enough to get in&hellip;.are lazy, who get grades they DO NOT DESERVE AND A SHEEPSKIN CAUSE THEY ARE BLACK OR STUDENTS FROM ABROAD ON OUR TAX MONEY&hellip;as none of them pay tuition it is given to them like everything else. </p>

<p>After hours of tedious and painstaking reseach, plumbing the depths of academia (wikipedia; it took about 10 seconds because my internet is slow), I discovered that John Hanson was indeed black.  But, he was not the same John Hanson who was elected president of the congress in 1781.  The black John Hanson was a Liberian Senator who lived about 100 years later&hellip;</p>

			<p>If any of you have seen the movie, &#8220;The Last King of Scotland&#8221;, there is a scene where Idi Amin is addressing the crowd.</p>
<p>He tells them that the Greeks stole their philosophy from the Africans, and they all cheer wildly. </p>
<p>I had to laugh out loud at that one, but I think it was used to show the deranged character of Amin.</p>
<p>Later, though, the script-writers, in a PC gesture, had one of Amin&rsquo;s wives commit adultery with an ego-centric Scottish doctor. This is later admitted to be false in the post-movie interviews  &mdash;  it was a black man (who was not a doctor) who was the adulterer, and upon whom Amin quite rightly got revenge.</p>

			<p>Sometimes intelligent whites get sucked into this nonsense as well. Professor John Flynn (of the famous Flynn effect, IQs rising over time) in his most recent book, What is Intelligence?, denounces &#8220;racists&#8221; who say blacks are genetically inferior.</p>
<p>He states on page 157, &#8220;We can point to thousands of counterexamples, the thousands of blacks of genius or talent ranging from Saint Augustine and Victor Hugo to Paul Robeson and Thomas Sowell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saint Augustine? He was from Tunisia (Arab or Berber, not black). Victor Hugo? Check out the photos on Wikipedia: obviously white. If there are thousands of counterexamples, why can&rsquo;t he come up with even 4 intelligent, genuinely black men? I think that says it all. And why would a psychologist who understands statistics use individual examples to refute group averages? The fear of racism causes brain freeze even in brainy people.<br/>

			<p>Yeah, I live in the Detroit area, and that is so true about Detroit.  I just graduated from a university in the area and I swear that there were black students in my class that could not read.  No joke.  I would always be put into groups (the professors always broke up groups with more than two white students in ALL classes) and we would debate or read from the books and they could not read that well, some could, most had trouble, and others I swear not at all!!  Anyways, they would throw out &#8220;facts&#8221; that weren&rsquo;t even even the books and completely made up, much like this article.  The professors would praise them so much as if they were five years old and just tied theirs shoes for the first time.  </p>

			<p>I will give the Multicults this much: Alexander Dumas.</p>
<p>His grandmother was from the Caribbean Islands. She might have been all Black, or maybe just part. </p>
<p>So Alexander was, at most, a quadroon.</p>
<p>Just as if Obama married a White woman, their child would be a quadroon.</p>

<p>That is precisely the central logical problem with afrocentrism. It&rsquo;s also how &#8220;Martin Luther&#8221; King was busted for plagiarism. He stole Jack Boozer&rsquo;s ideas, but those ideas survived in the work of Boozer. Aristotle, Pythagoras, Plato, etc. have no Egyptian antecedents at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to have Europhile&rsquo;s excerpt from Flynn; if Flynn thinks Augustine and Victor Hugo were black, he&rsquo;s not qualified to discuss much of anything. </p>

<p>Does everyone know that Idi Amin Dada died in Saudi Arabia a few years ago?? He fled there to avoid being tried for crimes against humanity and despite international warrants for his return to Africa, the Saudi royals refused to do so. He was given a state funeral in Saudi which was attended by a U.S. state department assignee. Muslims and especially the Saudis are the real enemy of civilization. I believe that Mugabe and Mbeke will also flee to Saudi when their time is up.</p>

<p>The single, great flaw in James Flynn&rsquo;s &#8220;logic&#8221; is the fact he only offers anecdotes as evidence of his allegation that blacks aren&rsquo;t mentally inferior to Whites.  He offers no hard evidence, because he knows that evidence clearly shows otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/2006_20PSnew.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/2006%20PSnew.pdf</a></p>
<p>He also fails to mention the fact many if not most of these &#8220;black&#8221; geniuses undoubtedly have more than a significant amount of White ancestry (it&rsquo;s estimated the AVERAGE American black is about 17-18% White and 10% of black American adults are 50% White).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm</a></p>
<p>Fact: one out every two American Whites have IQs above 100 compared to only one out of every six American blacks.  By the time you reach the part of the bell curve that corresponds to genius-level IQs, blacks are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>James Flynn is typical of what&rsquo;s on the Left: disingenuous and dishonest folk.</p>

<p>Our enemies are experts on this particular subject.</p>
<p>It could be viewed as another absurd application of zero-sum- that the gain of one means the loss of another.  If the Greeks took philosophy from blacks, then it was no longer available to blacks, as the gain to Greece meant africa&rsquo;s loss.</p>

<p>The problem is not fringe Afrocentrists at Medgar Evans College. Is that what they want us to believe? The problem is the Afrocentrism in mainstream America, from Bob Jones university to the elementry schools in the richest, whitest suburbs. White = Bad, Color = Good; is not confined to minority neighborhoods and colleges. We&rsquo;re the ones who deserve to see some well needed change. History is not being taught accurately at Harvard. And I&rsquo;m not some &#8216;whites invented everything to begin with&rsquo; or &#8216;white genes make everything possible&rsquo; true believer. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have to be to see that. </p>

			<p>On another website a black poster gave a link to this website claiming to have unmasked the true face of Cleopatra, which shows a black skinned woman with cornrowed hair and an unusually aquiline nose for an African or Nubian woman. On the site, they claim experts in Egypt have spent a year created this computer generated image by observing nothing more than artifacts. Interesting thing is, there are no existing artifacts which ever showed her so dark skinned, and the ancient coins show a woman on profile with extremely non African features, and wavy Caucasian hair. It&rsquo;s almost comical that they would even try and suggest experts would even begin to claim they could replicate her image, when the whereabouts of her remains have yet to be discovered.  Here is the websites which claims to have the true likeness of Cleopatra</p>

			<p>Allowing blacks to invent history in order to enhance their self-esteem is not only pathetic but dangerous in the extreme.  It bolsters their already well-developed sense of grievance and hatred of other races and lends legitimacy (in their &#8220;minds&#8221;) to their tendency toward violence and criminality in general.</p>
<p>The ugly truth is that black Africans have contributed virtually nothing of value to human progress, save simple manual labor, and then most effectively when enslaved.  There is simply no place for them in the modern world.  They should be returned to the African continent, where they could quickly revert to their natural state of tribal primitivism and savagery.</p>
<p>Tragically, this will not happen and we can expect that they eventually will lay waste to our nation as we&rsquo;ve known it.</p>

			<p>It is written history that the Afican blacks when te Europeans first arrived in sub-Saharan Africa in the 16 &amp; 17th Centuries, depending on where on te continent, no one there hd seen or used a wheel or used animals for transport purposes.  No permanent buildings and even te Zimababwe ruins weare thought (except by te balck) to have been built by Arab slave traders,  They are piles of stones, no cioncrete to bu¡uind tem.They did not know how to write or count more than to ten (fingers&rsquo;)but had no spoken or written numbers for them.   With no way of writing or measuring, it is obvious that the African blacks could not invent more that perhaps the short stabbing spear /assegai) thought up by Shaka the bastard (literally) Zulu chief i the early parrt obf the 19th Century who cruelly organised the Zulus and killed many thousands in his quest for an empire until the Zulus, under Cetswayo, were finally defeated by the Boers. after he had been beaten and exiled for some years to Britain before returning to SA.  We have all seen thses so called black inventions listed before but with the real inventors alongside.  Open heart surgery (a full transplant) was fist performed by Dr Christian Barnard in the 1960s but since, Africans insist that this was done by a black man who actually was watching and passing some surgical instruments when called for.  But the truth is really known and even today what have they achieved that is of any worth?  Let us have a factual list of worthwhile inventions by black people, please.  It should not take long to write.</p>

			<p>I have seen them state countless times that Elvis stole from blacks, or stole the limelight from Chuck Berry and Little Richard, which is absolutely false, since his first hit single came before theirs. I think it is jealousy pure and simple that he was given the title of King of Rock n roll over a black man. But let&rsquo;s face it, there were no black singers with the voice looks and charisma he had, especially that would have made young females swoon. Berry, Richard, and Fats Domino hardly fit the bill. And even though blacks like to say they created rock music, few can explain why outside of a handful of singers in the 50&rsquo;s, there were virtually no black rock stars after that with the soul exception of Jimmy Hendricks, and the lead singer of Thin Lizzy. They can and claim rap, hip-hop soul, R&B;, and Jazz, but they can never claim rock music. Whites dominated rock hands-down!</p>

Well, maybe.  <br/>
But no&hellip;. if you just take <i>credit</i>  for it, then the originator of the idea still has it. You can brag all you want, but he still has his idea.  Obviously the Africans had all this wonderful science and philosophy robbed right from under them and they were left bereft of it and in their present primitive condition with nothing. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so backward today   &mdash;   because they were robbed of their philosophy. What a vicious crime!</p>
<p>The whites came and  physically TOOK it, by stealth, and the Africans were left with <i>nothing!</i>  That&rsquo;s much more than just &#8220;taking credit&#8221;   &mdash;  -  they took the ACTUAL knowledge ITSELF!</p>
<p>I think they see it as akin to stealing gasoline out of  a tank.  If I steal the gas out of your tank, then I have all your gas and your tank is empty.   Yes, to them, knowledge is like something you put in (or steal out of) a gas tank.  Either it&rsquo;s in there, or it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s full or it&rsquo;s empty.</p>

Dr Ashton, of Cambridge University, said the images, to be broadcast as part of a Five documentary on Cleopatra, reflect the monarch&rsquo;s Greek heritage as well as her Egyptian upbringing.   &hellip;  &#8220;She probably wasn&rsquo;t just completely European. You&rsquo;ve got to remember that her family had actually lived in Egypt for 300 years by the time she came to power.&#8221;<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
It&rsquo;s disgusting to see that a presumed intellectual, a professor at Cambridge University (!!!) no less, could fall so utterly for this trendy Afrocentrism and grovel at its feet. </p>
<p>I have a biography of Cleopatra  (she was actually Cleopatra VII) written by the classical scholar Michael Grant.  In it, he states that Cleopatra &#8220;did not possess one single drop of Egyptian blood&#8221;. He&rsquo;s not the only who states this.  She was of Macedonian descent, and  was the product of eight generations of brother-sister marriages designed  to keep the royal bloodline pure.   As with the Aryans in India, the Ptolemy&rsquo;s in Egypt had evolved their own forms of strict racial separation. In short, Cleopatra was WHITE!  </p>
<p>We do know  (from Theocritus) that her ancestor Ptolemy II was a blond, but Grant speculates that she most probably had dark hair.  At any rate, she certainly did not have the dark skin and African features shown in this ridiculous sculpture. Dr. Ashton ought to be well aware of this.  Did he never have a gander at Cleopatra&rsquo;s geneological chart?  (Yes, these historical details are all available.)</p>
<p>Old books like this (Grants&rsquo;)are becoming scarce treasures as time goes by, as more and more history is re-written to appease  African craving for self-esteem,  while true scholarship falls victim  to political correctness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this here before, so won&rsquo;t go into it any further now.</p>

<p><br/>  &mdash;  -Posted by Mr. Pibb at 9:49 PM on January 25 <p>Two points are to be made here.<p>First, if blacks want credit for various scientific discoveries and inventions, they should be currently able to display the capacity to actually absorb and <i>use</i> this knowledge.  If black people really had discovered the principles of higher mathematics and mechanical engineering, why aren&rsquo;t African nations in the forefront of the industrialized world today?  Why aren&rsquo;t black students filling math, science and engineering courses in schools?<p>My second point is that I think many blacks do indeed believe that science and technology themselves were &#8220;stolen&#8221; by whites, not simply the credit for them.  As the lead article by Gedahlia Braun in the current issue of American Renaissance sets forth, blacks have a diminished capacity to think abstractly, are thus more likely to think of the &#8220;stolen&#8221; scientific knowledge in concrete rather than abstract terms (e.g., as a &#8220;secret formula&#8221;), and are less likely to understand the systematic and interconnected nature of the abstract principles underlying the corpus of mathematical, scientific and techonological knowledge accumulated and utilized by the white man since the time of the Greeks.  This is an important part of the explanation, I believe, why blacks persist in speaking of their &#8220;stolen legacy&#8221; (the actual title of the 1954 book by George James, a university graduate [!], that first made such claims) in terms that appear petty and absurd to whites.</p></p></p></p>

			<p><b>Philosophy is not a secret kept in a bottle that you can snatch and run away with.</b></p>
<p>But Africans think it is!  I can understand the roots of their misconception. But it remains exactly that   &mdash;    purely a misconception.  There was cultural interchange, and the Greeks did get some of their concepts from Egypt.  And, true,  in terms of grography, Egypt is a country PHYSICALLY located in Africa. That is, it&rsquo;s <b>I&gt; on  </b> the <i>African continent,</i> but is not a part of Africa in other respects, such as culturally or racially. In the latter ways, it was a part of the Mediterranean world   &mdash;    defined as such when communication was by water rather than landmass.  Thus, the Egyptians were really a Mediterranean people, more so than African.  If you want to consider them Africans because they lived on the African continent, then so are the Boers  and white Rhodesians for the same reason. You can&rsquo;t logically include one but exclude the other. </p>
<p>If Egypt was not &#8220;African&#8221; culturally or racially, then even less so was Alexandria.   Alexandria was a center of science and learning in the ancient world.  It was the greatest city in the Mediterranean,  until surpassed by Rome. And yes, Alexandria is physically located on the African shore (facing Europe);  but what these Afro-centrists fail (or refuse) to acknowledge is that Alexandria was a GREEK city   &mdash;   founded and populated by Greeks   &mdash;   located in Egypt. It was not even Egyptian (much less &#8220;African&#8221;) other than geographically.    It would be like calling Johannesburg, founded  and built by whites, a Bantu city. Well yes, it is in Africa.  But do American Indians take credit for New York, Philadelphia and Boston? Did they build the Hoover dam, develop atomic energy and put a man on the moon?<br/>

<p>In that book, he asserts that the Muslims, in the era of the Crusades, had universities, pharmacies, daily baths, a code of honor in battle from which the Europeans got the idea of chivalry, and a  system of communication using pigeons, which the Christians could not figure out, and attributed to Satan!</p>
<p>I could be that all these things were influenced by the Greeks (the moslems were very familiar with, and scholars of, Greek philosophy), but they all contributed to modern civ.</p>

			<p>I have heard many times how &ldquo;Elvis&rdquo; stole the black music, if that the case did Louis Armstrong not steal the White mans trumpet, Stevie Wonder the piano, Jimmi Hendrix the guitar and on and on? </p>
<p><br/>
I once got a good laugh watching an Afro-centrist give his convoluted explanation to another poster over the web, about the invention of musical instruments. When he was told the guitar came from Spain, and the piano from Italy, he then said that Spain and Italy were conquered by Black Moors, and they were the real inventors of both. So therefore both black inventions. Then added quite smugly that the true master of the piano (Beethoven) was black. Historical facts mean nothing to them. They simply make a game of rewriting history and painting it black.<br/>

			<p>Afro-centric history and claims of African inventions and their technological superiority always revert to claims going back thousands of years, with the preaching of how ancient Europeans had to go to Africa for knowledge, etc. The adherents of how advanced Africans were millenia ago always fall silent when you ask the simple question &ldquo;What happened to the intellectually superior Africans 5,000 years ago that caused Africa to become so backwards and savage&rdquo;? <br/>

<p>I know that when they describe Africa before the white man arrived, they insist Africans kings and queens. Yes, ALL of them mind you! That they were an advance people with great knowledge while whites &#8220;who they civilized&#8221; were living caves. </p>
<p>What changed? The evil colonizing white man came, and stole their knowledge and memory.</p>
<p>Which only begs the question, if whites were living in caves, how did they manage build ships to sail there, before blacks civilized them? And how did such an uncivilized inferior group of cavemen manage to steal the mighty black mans knowledge and memory? More silence of course.<br/>
