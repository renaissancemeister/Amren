<h1>Parents See Bias in School Pep Talks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Smeltz, Courier-Post Staff (Cherry Hill, New Jersey), January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Eastern Regional High School administration targeted only black and Latino students in a series of academic pep talks last week, angering some parents who said the effort smacked of discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Administrators described the talks as 10-minute motivational meetings held over four days during school hours. They said each was meant to encourage minority enrollment in advanced, honors and other higher-level classes.</p>
<p>But their approach, targeting minority students and failing to inform parents, fell short, some families said. The administration required all black and Latino students to attend the gatherings  &mdash;  regardless of each student&rsquo;s individual academic performance  &mdash;  while white students were exempted.</p>
<p>Eastern High counts 234 black and 65 Latino students; together, they make up about 14 percent of the student population.</p>
<p>But as of last year, they accounted for roughly 1 percent of enrollment in advanced placement classes; 2 percent to 3 percent in honors classes; 15 percent to 16 percent in accelerated-level classes; and 20 percent to 40 percent in standard classes, Principal Robert M. Tull Jr. said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tull provided the memo to the Courier-Post. It also indicates that the district does not fully comply with the Comprehensive Equity Plan, a districtwide effort to combat discriminatory or inequitable practices. State law requires that every school have such an equity plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Eastern High, Tull&rsquo;s correspondence suggests, not enough female or minority students are enrolled in accelerated or advanced classes. The plan is designed to ensure fair, equal access to all levels of classes.</p>

<p>But&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t that defeat the purpose of <i>accelerated/advanced classes</i>, as acceptance to said classes is based on <i>academic</i> merit not &#8220;inclusivity&#8221;?<br>
If they did a school-wide I.Q. test, testing every student, and found that 0% of students with an I.Q. at/under 90 were in the accelerated/advanced classes, yet said students formed 20% of the student population, shouldn&rsquo;t the parents of these students lobby the &#8220;intelligentist&#8221; bias of those clases?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Eastern Regional High School administration targeted only black and Latino students in a series of academic pep talks last week, angering some parents who said the effort smacked of discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The internal conflict in Liberals must be overwhelming and quite maddening. Let&rsquo;s examine the facts&hellip;</p>
<p>When Black and Hispanic students fall woefully behind White students, Liberals wail that racism is to blame for the results. They claim that Whites are somehow receiving &#8220;more attention&#8221; and &#8220;better education&#8221; in the system. Consequently, the schools respond and make diligent, concentrated efforts to address the differences and produce &#8220;equality&#8221; in the results. Then, when the schools plan and initiate special actions to apply concentrated academic help and assistance to Blacks and Hispanics, they are accused of racism for singling them out unfairly.</p>
<p>No surprises there at all. Blacks and Hispanics are dissatisfied no matter what happens. Could it be that they simply are unable to cope with life in civilization?</p>
<p>The best course of action for White parents to take, is to ensure your children are enrolled in all-White, private schools with the best-quality, best-paid teachers and facilities. Leave the Blacks, Hispanics, and Liberal Whites alone in their own diverse world to argue and bicker the finer points of racism while your children are studying diligently in school, focused on learning, while far removed from the nonsense and superfluousness of multiculturalism and diversity.</p>

			<p>&#8220;School officials cannot ask blacks and Hispanics to study harder without asking whites, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if they ask whites to study harder, I have no problem with that.  If they heed the advice, they&rsquo;ll just move further away from the third worlders. <br>

			<p>This sounds like propaganda.  </p>
<p>This article says that &#8220;The administration required all black and Latino students to attend the gatherings &mdash; regardless of each student&rsquo;s individual academic performance &mdash; while white students were exempted.&#8221;</p>
<p>No way in hell that any White led &#8220;administration&#8221; required any of this. C&rsquo;mon, that would be professional suicide!!</p>
<p> Whites are the bottom of the heap in this new world.  Like the Reverand said, &#8220;White needs to get Right!&#8221;</p>
<p>White people are the root of all evil, and if we just accept it, our death as a race will go much smoother. Sssshh. Shhh. Go to sleep.</p>

			<p>I suppose these parents have never heard of the concept of collective responsibility.  A hard fact of life is that you will sometimes take the rap for something bad someone else did if you&rsquo;re a part of something that someone else belongs.  My first real experience with this was in the second grade, for a time, about half the boys in my class were being unusually ill-behaved, so all the boys in my class, including the ones not acting up, were prohibited from lunch recess.</p>
<p>If the upper management of a corporation makes bad decisions and drives the company into bankruptcy, the entry level workers lose their jobs.  If someone else in your army brigade screws up, everyone in the brigade is getting punished.</p>

			<p>IF they had been DECENT parents they would have THANKED the school board for the Special Attention their children were being given, But in the USUAL MINORITY mindset (why) should they do ANYTHING to succeed when Papa Washington will pay their bills if they don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>In the ancient Roman army, if a soldier or group of soldiers were responsible for misconduct, it was often the job of the other troops to administer punishment up to and including death.</p>

			<p>This is sadly true. Many blacks and hispanics that I went to school with had great potential but didn&rsquo;t put in any effort to their studies. They simply just went to play basketball, soccer, or football. They got C&rsquo;s and D&rsquo;s but even they know they could have done more. This due to poor parenting. Some of these kids can&rsquo;t concentrate because their mean parents or too many kids runing around the house making noise. Please don&rsquo;t insult this problem because this is a serious problem.</p>

			<p>No one was ever educated by a pep talk. In my seven years at an all black school they would have periodic pep talks. Before the state test they would have daily pep sessions with all sorts of foolishness. In between magic shows and cash giveaways they reminded the students to 1. finish the test no matter what. 2. come to school on time. 3. Come to school. 4. try. The very idea that any serious college bound kid would need to be told these things is an insult. The school failed and the state just took it over. The state also took over all the failing schools in our district. It is no coincidence that every one is around 100% black. I bet thet had plenty of pep talks also, what a waste.  </p>

			<p>People who say black students don&rsquo;t want to succeed are absolutely wrong. Almost every kid wants to be respected and thought of as brilliant, however not all have the means to get into a decent college, self-disipline for homework etc. </p>
<p>&#8220;Rational Thinker&#8221; and others that claim otherwise have clearly never spent time with elementary and middle school children. They&rsquo;re all ambitious until high school rolls around and the coursework is too rigorous for them to handle. </p>

<p><br>
The administration didn&rsquo;t include under-performing whites in the meetings because they <i>don&rsquo;t want</i> more white students in advanced classes.  If they&rsquo;d included under-achieving whites in those pep rallies, they risked having more whites sign up for advanced classes.  </p>
<p>Simply put: more white &#8220;achievers&#8221; = increase in the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;!  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have that, can we?  What could be more horrifying to liberals than watching working-class whites leave blacks in the dust just like the upper crust?  Better keep those (mostly low-income) under-achieving whites ignorant so they can diversify the standard classes.<br>

<p>As Dave Berry says, &#8216;I&rsquo;m not making this up&rsquo;. A plan that expects equal outcome under the guise of equal access. It&rsquo;s not enough to provide equal access, you have to also make everyone equal in the process. Good luck with that. </p>
<p>Well, we have a black role model in the White house so we can expect the education gap to disappear (unless we&rsquo;re told later, as I&rsquo;m sure we will be, &#8216;it&rsquo;s more complicated than that&rsquo;),</p>

			<p>Logic that&rsquo;s certainly good for a laugh or two. So Whites are asked to study harder also. The end result being that Blacks and Hispanics advance a point or two while White students advance ten to fifteen points higher. Ah, well. Such is the fine difference between political correctness and outright insanity, I guess.</p>
