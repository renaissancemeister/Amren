<h1>DA Intern Booted After Arrest</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurel J. Sweet, Boston Herald, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A promising Harvard Law School standout told cops during a bizarre drunken tirade that he would &#8220;lie and cheat&#8221; to ruin them if  &mdash;  as a future attorney  &mdash;  he ever calls them to a witness stand, police said.</p>
<p>A statement like that really has no place in the practice of law,&#8221; said Jake Wark, spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley, who took Charles Claudio Simpkins on last fall as an intern and will now prosecute him on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</p>
<p>A police report states that Simpkins, 24, made the threat early Saturday morning, just four months from graduation, as he spilled out of a Theater District bar and into the back of a Boston police cruiser, barking to officers, &#8220;Give me a (expletive) ride, I work for the district attorney&rsquo;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wark confirmed Simpkins has been booted from his unpaid position assisting prosecutors in Dorchester District Court, for which Harvard hand-picked him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police claim that after he was arrested, Simpkins said, &#8220;Dan Conley is a (expletive), but he&rsquo;ll get you (expletives).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A proud conservative, Simpkins seemed destined for a future of unlimited potential.</p>
<p>A graduate of City College of New York, where he majored in philosophy and political science, Simpkins was in 2005 named a Harry S. Truman Scholar for his devotion to public service. He has studied abroad and appeared on several major networks, as well as on YouTube.com, discussing politics.</p>
<p>In a post in September, one political blogger said Simpkins &#8220;is what Obama could have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>A former CCNY classmate gushed online, &#8220;Like Barack, Claudio is also .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. politically active, handsome, and has more honors than I can count.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We have not heard the last of him.  He will find a way to smooth over his disorderly conduct arrest and get hired someplace anyway.  In 3-4 years, we will hear about him being at the center of some highly-publicized controversy.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be worried if I were him. Once this dies down and is forgotten, which will be soon, he will be on the fast-track to success again. I&rsquo;m sure we have a future president in the making.</p>

			<p>Sounds like he had a bad night at the whiskey.</p>
<p>An officer fell while booking Claudio? So Claudio was putting up a struggle?</p>
<p>Whiskey does not change a person  &mdash;  it merely allows what is inside to come out. I think Claudio had ego problems; illusions of grandeur.</p>

			<p>How apt to see this posted here on the day the GOP struck out at its most, really only, loyal constituency: whites. They have just retorted to Obama-mania by naming a black, Michael Steele, as party chairman. I am heartily glad at having re-registered Independent a couple years back. Clearly the Republicans have no clue what conservative means. Hence they cannot preserve that which is its core: the racial and ethnic background of the nation.</p>

			<p>Maybe this Simpkins and Obama are a lot alike, but at least Obama had just enough sense to know that he shouldn&rsquo;t be popping off towards cops.  Question is, how many more Simpkinses are there out there that think they deserve it simply because Obama got it?  (I.E. George Soros&rsquo;s money).</p>
<p>Philip:</p>
<p>Michael Steele has never as much as won a public elected office on his own accord.  He &#8220;won&#8221; Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, but in MD, Lt. Govs do not run separately from Governor, the Gov. candidate choosing a running mate.  Ehrlich chose Steele, as he was black and ran the Maryland Republican Committee, before that he ran the Prince Georges County Repub. Committee, and Ehrlich won, so Steele got to be Lt. Gov.  It would be like saying that Joe Biden won the Vice-Presidency.  Steele tried in 2006 for the U.S. Senate, but lost to a white Democrat.</p>

<p>This is what passes for handsome these days.  As for the honors, I am sure some were created just for handing out to people like him.</p>

			<p>A Harvard Law Student with an undergraduate degree from the City College of New York?  Why do I seriously doubt that he was a &#8220;stand-out&#8221; at Harvard, rather than an AA beneficiary who had the red carpet rolled out for him on account of his ethnicity  (I&rsquo;ve seen it many times).  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll apologize, graduate from Harvard - and probably still wind up with a good job over a number of better qualified candidates.  </p>

			<p>At least he&rsquo;s got some spunk. I guess enough beer makes him honest, too. They need to patent whatever is in beer that makes you honest and give it to black men as a public service. They do always say we&rsquo;re not doing enough to serve their special needs. </p>

<p>Indeed.  This is what Barack Obama Jr. could have been&hellip;&hellip;..had he been as fond of his liquor as Barack Obama Sr was.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s true of the guy running against for the Chairmanship too.  No public office just party committees.</p>

Three points about this interesting article:</p>
<p>Point one: A remarkable thing here is that it is the rare case where affirmative action and &#8220;Obamamania&#8221; are actually working <i>against</i> a person. This is because this minor incident wouldn&rsquo;t have made it into the newspaper if the guy weren&rsquo;t a black law student. Drunk and disorderly conduct is a pretty minor offense, and you don&rsquo;t read about it in the papers very often. Now, he has a terrible reputation among his fellow students and prospective employers.</p>
<p>Point two: <i>&#8221;.  .  . handsome&#8221;?</i> Sorry, but that is a thoroughly un-handsome face.  </p>
<p>Point three: The way they describe him, he sounds like an academic standout. But if you look again at the phrase <i>&#8220;named a Harry S. Truman Scholar for his devotion to public service,&#8221;</i> you see that this is an award given to people for exta-curricular activities, not for academic achievement. If he volunteered somewhere for a few hours a month while at CCNY, he became eligible for this.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Like Barack, Claudio is also &hellip; politically active, handsome&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a different standard for what is considered conventially attractive when it comes to mullatto black males?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s always said that popular culture dictates whats hot and what&rsquo;s not. But there has always been a very wide gap between whats usually accepted as attractive and unattractive and no amount of media spin can turn &#8220;butt ugly&#8221; into &#8220;handsome&#8221; in any society. </p>
<p>Obama is close enough to the line between &#8220;okay looking&#8221; and &#8220;slightly offensive to the discerning eye&#8221; to pull it off. But this guy? Handsome??? A face only a mother could love&hellip;And that&rsquo;s a stretch.</p>

<p>Another up and coming young black man expressing the entitlement he thinks he deserves.</p>
