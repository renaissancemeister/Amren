<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28852750/">DHS Rule Aimed at Obama&rsquo;s Illegal Aunt</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The White House is promising to reconsider a new rule requiring high-level approval before federal immigration agents can arrest fugitives. The Bush administration quietly imposed the unusual directive days before the election of Barack Obama, whose aunt has been living in the United States illegally.</p>
<p>The directive from the Homeland Security Department came amid concerns that such arrests might generate &#8220;negative media or congressional interest,&#8221; according to a newly disclosed federal document obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The directive makes clear that U.S. officials worried about possible election implications of arresting Zeituni Onyango, the half-sister of Obama&rsquo;s late father, who at the time was living in public housing in Boston. She is now believed to be living in Cleveland.</p>
<p>A copy of the directive, &#8220;Fugitive Case File Vetting Prior to Arrest,&#8221; was released to the AP just over two months after it was requested under the Freedom of Information Act. It does not mention President Obama or any members of his extended family.</p>
<p>The directive is still in place, Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Kelly Nantel told the AP. It originally was distributed Oct. 31 by e-mail to immigration officers by an assistant director at the agency. Obama was elected president five days later. Nantel said the directive called for close supervision over any cases that could be high profile. She said it was not specific to Obama&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Deportation order</b></p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s aunt was instructed to leave the country four years ago by an immigration judge who rejected her request for asylum from her native Kenya. The East African nation has been fractured by violence in recent years, including a period of two months of bloodshed after December 2007 that killed 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Despite the deportation order, Onyango traveled to Washington last week for her nephew&rsquo;s inauguration. News organizations observed her attending an inaugural ball at Washington&rsquo;s Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, a historic luxury hotel, with her immigration lawyer, Margaret Wong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rogers said he met Onyango once, in November, and described her as a private, spiritual woman who remains strong despite legal, medical and financial difficulties.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s had a hard life but is not feeling sorry for herself,&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;She&rsquo;s strong for a woman who&rsquo;s been beaten up like she has by life.&#8221; Of Obama, he said: &#8220;She&rsquo;s very proud of her nephew.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s Oct. 31 directive was &#8220;effective immediately and until further notice,&#8221; and required that immigration agents obtain approval from ICE field office directors or deputy directors before arresting fugitives. An approval would depend on an internal review that would consider, among other issues, &#8220;any potential for negative media or congressional interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nantel said there was never any direction that officials should not take action on an enforcement issue. It clarified that potentially high-profile cases needed to be coordinated with the agency&rsquo;s senior officials.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department censored parts of the document before turning it over to the AP, citing privacy and law enforcement reasons for withholding some of the information, including the name of the person who sent the e-mail. It also blacked out the names of recipients of the directive, making it impossible to determine whether it was sent to anyone outside the department or outside government.</p>
<p><b>Donations returned</b></p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign said in October it was returning $260 that Onyango had contributed in small increments to Obama&rsquo;s presidential bid over several months. Federal election law prohibits most foreigners from making political donations. Onyango listed her employer as the Boston Housing Authority and last gave $5 on Sept. 19.</p>

			<p><i>The Bush administration quietly imposed&hellip;</i> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it many times here over the past few years and it mertis repeating: The Republican Party betrayed everything Conservative about America over the past eight years. It now sickens me to see any of them pretending to stand up to Democrats. I hope and pray that no one here is fooled by their nonsense.</p>
<p>The fact is that I voted for Bush twice. I am a tradional Conservative from a long line of traditional Conservatives. Conservatism no longer equates to the RNC.</p>
<p>Bush and his fellow Republicans in congress had six years of unlimited control of the federal government to take America toward Conservative values. They did the opposite and betrayed the Conservative voters who elected him. McCain, the traitor, would have been worse, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>Of course, Obama is a bitter enemy to Conservatism, but he never pretended to be a friend. I have no doubt that four years under Obama will ruin the nation even more than it is ruined now, but who can honestly say these days that Republicans are better. Frankly, they are not. I do not perceive any differences between Democrats and Republicans any longer.</p>
<p>In 2008, I supported and voted for Chuck Baldwin after learning about him here. </p>
<p>I doubt I will ever be able to stomach voting for (much less contributing money to) a Republican again. Of course, I would rather die than vote for a Democrat.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Onyango traveled to Washington last week for her nephew&rsquo;s inauguration. News organizations observed her attending an inaugural ball at Washington&rsquo;s Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, a historic luxury hotel, with her immigration lawyer, Margaret Wong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this what they call &#8216;living in the shadows&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;and described her as a private, spiritual woman&hellip;&#8221; Seems Rogers forget to mention career criminal and fugitive from justice. Here&rsquo;s an idea. Deport her. To the White House. House arrest. Force the O to share quarters with her for the next four years. Being stuck with Michelle, his mother in law and illegal auntie 24/7 might cause him to reconsider his positions on amnesty and illegal immigration. Plus, I&rsquo;m sure she will prove to be a big hit during press conferences.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The White House is promising to reconsider a new rule requiring high-level approval before federal immigration agents can arrest fugitives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why? Is Obama thinking about having his aunt arrested and deported? I would think that Obama would be delighted to have this power given to him by Bush. Think of all the high level drug lords and other types of fugitives that he can shake down for campaign donations.  </p>

<p>The anti-Native Born White nature of the Republican party was obvious as far back as the Nixon adminstration. Affirmative action was hatched in the heads of Richard Nixon, Hadleman and Ehrlicman. Also post-1965 non-white immigration increased during the Nixon years. During the the Reagan years, a major amnest was passed in 1986. The Reagan amnesty created a huge voting block that was crucial to putting the anti-white Kenyan bigot into office.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; such as you anonymous voted Republican because you quite enjoyed the wars of aggression of Nixon and Reagan. &#8220;Conservatism&#8221; for you anonymous and the Southern Baptists means the gargantuan military industrial complex and vicious wars of aggression. However, post-1965 immigration policy which is rapidly bringing about the complete racial and economic dispossession of Native Born White Americans was and continues to be an integral part of the Republican party political platform.</p>
<p>If you voted for Nixon,Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2 you voted for the complete racial dispossession of Native Born White America. No excuses. You are an adult and you should have known better. You voted for it. And now look at the mess we are in.</p>

			<p>The woman, an Obama relative, was an illegal living on public money and nothing was done. If pursued and promoted this situation could have derailed or at least put a serious dent in the Obama campaign. I hold no water for conspiracy theories but this man was forcibly elected.</p>
<p>When the rule of law is selectively applied the people eventually realize there is no moral authority to the law and society decays.</p>

			<p>Both parties kowtow to their Marxist masters and NeoCon leaders. The US was de-industrialized under the Bush administration to get rid of one of the last barriers to destroying the US as a white nation. It will now get worse, with a black &#8220;leader&#8221; in the White House as we head toward the NAU or worse. With 401K&rsquo;s going down the drain, SSI disappearing, it looks like they may go for the time honored bolshevik tradition of starving whites out while taking care of the third worlders who will never be able to form a real force to revolt against the NWO. The people in charge can have large middle classes in India and China to buy things, yet still keep most of the populations in those countries in poverty. Who needs whites, right? That&rsquo;s their thinking. </p>

<p>Well, what the hell do you think would&rsquo;ve happened if we voted for the Democrats?</p>

<p>Well then Anon at 6:10 on Jan 28, the obvious thing to do is to not vote for either a Republican and Democrat. The tweedle dee and tweedle dum game-vote for a republican because he is not a democrat-is rapidly bringing about the complete racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans.</p>
<p>By the way, Chuck Baldwin for president is complete nonesense. It is a complete waste of a vote. Chuck Baldwin should run for state legislature or congress. The presidency should be reduced to a figure head as should the Senate. Chuck Baldwin would be a very viable at a more local level. Do vote vote for anyone who aspires to be President or a Senator. Only treasonous megalomanics aspire to be President or US Senator.</p>

<p>Strong???? Strong??? She has been on welfare, food stamps, and disability payments since she arrived in this country. What&rsquo;s strong about that?</p>
<p>I have been paying into medicare since I began working in 1968.  Medicare has just informed my physician that medicare will pay only 10 percent of the total hip replacement I need.  I can&rsquo;t find a surgeon in my area who accepts medicare for hip replacements because medicare only pays 10 percent of the actual cost.</p>
<p>My last medicare statement (not a bill) recorded a payment of $340.00 total for $3,468.00 worth of diagnostic and other work including an  MRI.</p>
