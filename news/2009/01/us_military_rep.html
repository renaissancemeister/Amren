<h1>U.S. Military Report Warns &#8216;Sudden Collapse&rsquo; of Mexico Is Possible</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diana Washington Valdez, El Paso Times, January 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico is one of two countries that &#8220;bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse,&#8221; according to a report by the U.S. Joint Forces Command on worldwide security threats.</p>
<p>The command&rsquo;s &#8220;Joint Operating Environment (JOE 2008)&#8221; report, which contains projections of global threats and potential next wars, puts Pakistan on the same level as Mexico. &#8220;In terms of worse-case scenarios for the Joint Force and indeed the world, two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse: Pakistan and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexican possibility may seem less likely, but the government, its politicians, police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and press by criminal gangs and drug cartels. How that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state. Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report is one in a series focusing on Mexico&rsquo;s internal security problems, mostly stemming from drug violence and drug corruption. In recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security and former U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey issued similar alerts about Mexico.</p>

			<p>Why not send our American Marines into Mexico. To neutralize and disarm the Mexican military. Kick out the corrupt joke of a government, set up a military governor (like McArthur) and then redistribute the wealth and seal the border. Something that has needed doing for the last forty years or more.</p>

			<p>So what should we look for as &#8220;mile markers&#8221; to determine Mexico&rsquo;s stability? As a resident of Arizona, I consider this to be grim news, as those Mexicans will knock over any wall we have up, and scream &#8220;asylum!&#8221; once here. </p>
<p>Seriously, the U.S. really dropped the ball in the Mexican War, when we should have completely conquered Mexico, and smothered their corrupt culture and government while it was still in the cradle.</p>

			<p>Quite possible considering the few hundred elite who own most of Mexico and the drug barons who own the rest do not give a damn for any Mexican. What the report fails to mention is that if this does happen the biggest victim will be the US. The 1000&rsquo;s that illegally<br>
cross the border daily will become 10&rsquo;s of 1000&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>I guess the downfall of the U.S. economy causes more drug violence and drug corruption. Pakistan has never wanted to help herself. But, I guess both are our fault. </p>

<p>What makes this military strategist think that the US is going to be capable of carrying out a large scale military operation in the next several years if this economic fiasco and Obama have reduced the military to a skeleton level?</p>
<p>And, also, is he aware that the amnesty scheme Obama is certain to pass will assure that Mexicans will control the Southwest and any attack on Mexico will spark reprisals from them?  </p>
<p>Quite frankly, I think he would be better advised to project how he thinks the country should regroup after civil conflict, because there&rsquo;s a greater possibility of that than anything else at this point in time.<br>

			<p>If we can ship the illegal Mexicans back across the border, we could implement the ultimate revenge for the mayhem all the illegals have wrought upon America. It would be great seeing the &#8220;macho&#8221; Hispanics return and destablize the very Mexican Ruling Class that urged their Metizos across the border!</p>

The entire edifice of U.S. hegemony is a house of cards. Also worth a thought is ending the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; which is causing so much violence in Mexico by propagating an lucrative and illegal business. </p>

			<p>The feds don&rsquo;t get it.  Mexico is in the process of taking over the US through a slow motion invasion.  It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what happens to Mexico, because it will become a minor satellite nation of the US, which will be a de facto new territory of Mexico.  Mexicans will live in the US, and Mexico will be considered the &#8220;old country.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is a job for fix-it type men. Go in there and rescue the infrastructure and save the Mexican economy from downfall. The kind of job that needs done by those expert at spanish, by those with a strong moral foundation, and by those willing to do the jobs others wont do. The kind of men who are vibrant and necessary, an important part of an economic revival. In short, this is a job for Mexican men themselves. Don&rsquo;t allow men like these to shirk their responsibilities in these times. No cause in our lifetime is more worthwhile.</p>

			<p>A few generations ago, it was possible not to take Mexico seriously and dismiss it as just another tin-pot, ramshackle Latin American state typified by the donkey and the sight of  Jose&rsquo; taking a long siesta in the middle of the day (instead of toiling like White men did),propped up against the shade of a wall with his chin on his knees and a large sombrero on his head.<br>
    But today, Mexico is rather more than that stereotype, it&rsquo;s actually emerging as a serious security consideration for the USA.The cause is, of course, that over the past decades Mexico&rsquo;s population skyrocketed to over 100 million - and this not conuting the enormous ex-patriate contingent resident in the USA.<br>
  This fact is compounded by the apparent inability of Mexican authorities to deal with a serious drug-fuelled civil insurgency.<br>
 Unlike most European nations, the USA was always historically blessed by not having to share a contiguos land border with a powerful and hostile enemy.<br>
This might change.</p>

			<p> The collapse of Mexico into revolutionary civil war, along with a human tidal wave sweeping across our border is entirely possible. If our economy goes in the tank, Mexico will certainly feel the aftereffects. It&rsquo;s time to have a more realistic policy toward our neighbors in Latin America. Their stability ultimately affects us more than Europe.</p>

			<p>Violence and corruption are long established cultural norms in Mexico.  Rather than reform their own country Mexicans choose to impose their criminal culture upon ours.  </p>
<p>This current engineered escalation of violence in Mexico is a Globalist pretext to allow even more of these unwanted and incompatible parasites into our country under the auspices of asylum.  </p>
<p>We must stop them cold using the same means people have always utilized throughout history to repulse alien invaders&hellip;   </p>

			<p>In his farewell speech, Bush patted himself on the back for keeping the country safe from terrorist attacks and proof of that he said is the absence of attacks since 911.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t waste my time watching him say anything on T.V., but I had to chuckle when I read somebody who quoted him, because our ports and borders are as unprotected as they ever were, especially the southern border. If we haven&rsquo;t had another attack, it&rsquo;s because the motivation and inclination wasn&rsquo;t at a high enough pitch, plus maybe a bit of stupidity.   The lack of terrorism had absolutely nothing to do with Bush and everything to do with the jihadists, because small, commando sabatoge units could literally bring this country to a halt if about ten teams of six each were running amuk throughout the country.</p>
<p>Any group of terrorists in the world could dance across the Mex/US border anytime they wanted to, armed to the teeth, if they were so inclined.  For this man to take credit for preventing terrorism after refusing to guard the borders is quite laughable.  </p>

			<p>This is nothing to joke about.</p>
<p>It is time to build a &#8220;panic room&#8221; regardless of where you live in the U.S., regardless of where you live.  Stock it for survival and protection.  Fallout shelters may have been a joke in the early 1960s, but I don&rsquo;t think this is.</p>
<p>If Mexico collapses, and it has been approaching this for some time now, there will be waves of humanity crashing the border everywhere.  Americans will rush north, running away from them and not all of them will be like your Aunt Polly.  Police will not be able to manage things and martial law will likely be declared at least in some areas.</p>

<p>That comment may be more apt than you realize, because Glen Spencer over at American Patrol (www.americanpatrol.com) thinks that the increasing drug violence in Mexico can be strongly linked to certain parts of the US-Mexico border that are well-fenced.</p>

<p>&gt; Oh ye generation of ignorant conservatives!  Try studying the history of drug use and you will find that Americans have been using drugs since before the United States.  It was all legal until the US government started looking for means to implement various schemes aimed at political deceptions.  And the Germans invented Meth and Esctasy, not Hispanics!  Our own government did drug experiements during the Cold War looking for ways to wage war. Like Prohibition, it was making these drugs illegal that created the Black markets and organized crime.  Women out to clean up the world caused prohibition, and a lying newsman named Hearst and our government created a scare campaign filled with ridiculous and claims contrary to scientific studies to scare the public.  No wonder baby boomers didn&rsquo;t believe the propaganda, it was too silly.  The CIA made profits on cocaine trade from Columbia to pay for covert wars like the one in El Salvador and Nicauaga so they didn&rsquo;t have to go to congress.  WE created this - all of it. </p>
<p>Get educated. </p>
<p>Now it is time to take over Mexico and clean it up.  I have long believed that we would end up having to takeover in Mexico.  But I don&rsquo;t know if we are clean enough ourselves to clean Mexico up.<br>

			<p>We will HAVE to invade Mexico, because if we don&rsquo;t enter and stabalize it, Hugo Chevez will!</p>
<p>As much as we would like to wash our hands of Mexico and the Hispanic world, we will not be able to - unless we are okay will a South Carribean union that is frankly communist and highly anti-Ameican.  And don&rsquo;t forget, Russia is playing footsies with Chavez.  We have a two-bit Mussolini who pretends to be socialist, but is really ready to be the Stalin of Latin America.</p>
<p>War always changes social history.  We will have to work out the new set of political alliances in light of this threat and then try to manage our own country after that.  But I do not doubt that the Pentagon already is considering contingencies like signing up Mexicans for war to liberate Mexico when the government falls.</p>
<p>In the mean time, it is wise for Americans to prepare for the emergency in all manners.  I think some of us Amreners ought to begin a little short wave chatter.  There must be some among us who could set up a code and is already doing CB.  I have walk-talkies. My initial thoughts is to revive and use Morse Code with a code used inside that.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now it is time to take over Mexico and clean it up.&#8221;  Whiteplight.  I&rsquo;ve had thoughts along those lines for some time now.  Among the people of Mexican background in this country is a fair sized minority of loyal, productive, citizens.  I have no numbers, I just know some of them.  Perhaps there are two million?  Taking over a nation of over a hundred million miscreants and trying to reform them is an unattainable goal, but how about a buffer state all along the border?  Realize that Canada is, in reality, a prosperous economic appendage of the U.S.  Ninety percent of Canadians live within a hundred miles of our northern border.  Could we not establish a new country in the northernmost part of Mexico by expelling the riffraff and replacing them with these two million Good Mexicans?  It would, of course, be a client state, with its foreign policy subject to American approval, and we would reserve the right to intervene as necessary, but it would still be a good deal for its citizens.  They would be the best educated, most civilized of Hispanics, with a real capacity for enterprise and a strong interest in suppressing their less worthy brethren.  They would be in a position to have a healthy trade relationship with the U.S., just as Canada does.  I suspect that they&rsquo;d have no qualms about building a wall and guarding it fiercely to protect their new found paradise, and they&rsquo;d have no trouble sorting out who belongs and who does not.  There are a great many Mexicans who would like to live in a society that is Mexican, but civilized.  This new nation would be good for them, and even better for us.  </p>

			<p>This story to me sounds like more &#8220;prep&#8221; to prepare us for a union with Mexico (and Canada). Some excuse is needed. This will be one of them, along with the continuing collapse of the US economy. There are folks who think the people in charge are ready to toss the NAU idea and go full bore for the NWO over the next 4 years, but I think they&rsquo;ll just keep sliding downward as they are. </p>

I truly believe that they have ALREADY been so inclined and are here.  I defy anyone to distinguish your average Mestizo from an Arab or Iranian. THere are stories of Jihadist training camps in some S. American countries; notably Venezuela where they are becoming proficient in Spanish as well as in weaponry.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sudden collapse&#8221; possible?</p>
<p>Mexico is already a &#8220;failed state&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Hugo Chavez can or will &#8220;stabilize&#8221; Mexico.  Chavez&rsquo;s problem is that with oil prices so low, Venezuala&rsquo;s main source of income has evaporated.  It&rsquo;ll be a bit difficult for him to export any revolution without a thick bankroll.  Another good aspect of the decrease in crude prices, by the way, is that it has to be giving Iranian nuclear ambitions some serious complications.</p>

<p>Schoolteacher - you may be right.  But whatever we did, it would have to be something and will have to include occupying and gaining control of Mexico City.  We have done that before, we can do it again.  I think the country would eventually fall in line if Mexico City is under control.  But as I ponered in one post, we may be too far gone ourselves to do that.</p>
<p>Whatever we think, I don&rsquo;t think this is a frivilous issue.</p>

			<p>It almost seems that Mexico&rsquo;s government, sensing its nations&rsquo; immanent likelihood of collapse, has been discreetly enabling its citizens to illegally enter the US for many years now, so that when their own country collapsed due to their poor management of it, they would have established a strong enough contingent in the USA (assisted perhaps by US workers working hard to register illegal immigrants from Mexico as elligible voters in the USA) to begin to take over the USA.  Then they can start trying to wreck America the way they wrecked Mexico.  </p>

			<p>People wanting to intefer in other countries business must not have thought much of our founding fathers. We should mind our own business unless we are attacked. I do think we should declare war on mexico because they are waging a war on us and when another people protest in our streets under foreign flags,shoot at our border patrol and kidnap our citizens that should be a declaration of war.Also about 90% of all drugs are coming from this country. For every victim from the hands of a illegal the politicians should be held accountable and tried for treason. I think 98% of all the house should be tried for treason. Make that the president and everyone under him.We are a occupied country by internationalist.How much proff do people need to see to understand this? The mere fact that politicians do the exact opposite for what is best for its citizens and their country one would think would be enough evidence.You couldn&rsquo;t wake some people up with a sledgehammer!</p>

			<p>Whiteplight at 3:44 PM on January 18: Seizing an enemy capital has long been a good way to ensure compliance with the requirements of the victor, but in the case of Mexico, the capital doesn&rsquo;t rule the country.  Will the rebels in Chiapas lay down their arms, or the smugglers in Juarez, because El Presidente (the Mexican one) says to?  I would suggest another, ancient, practice: Take all the offspring of the ruling class hostage.  House them comfortably in some college dorms in the U.S., don&rsquo;t treat them badly, but let the Mexican government know that the young elite can stay there for a long time if need be.  It won&rsquo;t matter to the drug lords, but at least it might keep the official government and its rich supporters from making things any harder for us.  </p>

			<p>I can sleep safely tonight a mere 140 miles from the border knowing Mexico has no nuclear weapons. If they did, I would have seen one for sale at the flea market by now&hellip;</p>
<p>No, you would have seen it detonated on U.S. soil, in a U.S. city by the muslims!</p>

			<p>The feds don&rsquo;t get it. Mexico is in the process of taking over the US through a slow motion invasion. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what happens to Mexico, because it will become a minor satellite nation of the US, which will be a de facto new territory of Mexico. Mexicans will live in the US, and Mexico will be considered the &ldquo;old country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe the real fight will be after Mexico takes over the U.S. and the muslims want the Mexicans to convert.</p>

<p>I am inclined to agree that we should mind our own business and avoid disagreeable entanglements. However, I also agree that Mexico has been waging a subtle and silent war of &#8220;reconquista&#8221; against us for some time now.  We should inform Mexico in very clear terms that continued dumping of their population and meddling in our politics will be viewed  as attacks on our sovereignty (which they are) and will be met by a justified response.</p>
<p>That said, let us also bear in mind that every country we have gone into or had  entanglements with in the last 110 years has eventually ended up invading us in reverse, demographically, in the form of war brides,  refugees, etc.. Do we want more of the same   &mdash;   exactly what we should strive to avoid?   Will we never learn?</p>
