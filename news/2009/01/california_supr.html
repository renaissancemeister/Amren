			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, January 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California&rsquo;s highest court is poised to be the next battleground in the debate over benefits for illegal immigrants as the justices have agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a state law allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The decision could affect hundreds of illegal immigrant students who attend community colleges, Cal State and UC campuses and who say they would not be able to afford a higher education if required to pay out-of-state tuition, which can cost more than triple the amount that residents pay.</p>
<p>But the outcome could have a broader effect &mdash; at least nine other states, including Oklahoma, New York and Texas, have similar laws providing the reduced fees to illegal immigrants. Although a court decision would not be legally binding in other states, politicians around the country are looking at California as a litmus test for future legal challenges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Martinez vs. Regents of the University of California began with a lawsuit filed in Yolo County in 2005 by out-of-state students and their parents. The lawsuit alleges that education officials are violating federal law by granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants while not offering the same lower fees to students from outside California.</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. citizens should have at least the same rights as undocumented immigrants,&#8221; said one of the plaintiffs, Aaron Dallek, an Illinois native who graduated from UC Berkeley in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the 2008-09 school year, out-of-state undergraduates pay about $28,600 to attend a UC school, compared with about $8,000 for students who qualify for in-state tuition. Out-of-state undergraduate students at Cal State campuses pay on average $10,000 more than in-state students. At community colleges, California residents pay $26 per unit, while out-of-state students pay between $140 and $170.</p>
<p>Cora Orta, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who is a senior at UCLA, said she could not afford the school if she had to pay the higher tuition. As it is, the in-state fees are a stretch, she said. She is not eligible for loans, so she works part time, crams into a studio apartment with four other students and constantly applies for scholarships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The California Supreme Court case revolves around a 2001 state law, known as AB 540, that permits the tuition breaks. Under the law, illegal immigrant students qualify for in-state rates if they attended a California high school for three years, graduated here and signed an affidavit saying they will apply for permanent residency as soon as they are eligible. The law has remained in effect during the legal challenge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brady [Michael Brady, who represents the out-of-state students and their parents in the case, said California,] said that in passing the strict immigration law in 1996, Congress sought to deter people from coming to the U.S. and staying here illegally.</p>
<p>&#8220;When public benefits are provided, it encourages people to stay here,&#8221; Brady said. &#8220;That is why we have all these laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 2006-07 school year, 1,639 UC undergraduate and graduate students received in-state tuition under AB 540 provisions. Of those, about 70% were here legally, while the others were potentially undocumented, in the process of obtaining residency or their status could not be determined, according to university officials.</p>

			<p>Just one topic of proof that there is a serious dumbing down of Americans. For this to occur, there has to be a lot of dumb idiots in charge of higher education.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Illegal-immigrant tuition is $20,000 less than for out-of-state Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why California is a sewer state now facing bankruptcy. Whites are fleeing, property values are plummeting, and La Raza is &#8220;peacefully&#8221; transpiring via the White exodus and the high illegal birthrate. Consider the place Mexico. All of the ills you think of when you think of Mexico, know that they apply to Mexifornia now.</p>

			<p>This is good news and I hope this practice comes to an end. I was issued a Certificate of Residence by the Westchester County Department of Finance because I have proof that I am in the country legally. I could not use it for the fall and requested a new one for the spring but they denied it because they claim that the US government ID I have is unacceptable. Without it I would have to pay out-of-state tuition which I cannot afford while illegal aliens get a free ride.</p>
<p>A local reporter eloquently put in scope what I have been suspecting: they create and perpetuate the low-income status of people to get federal funds for their social programs.<br>
When it comes to illegal aliens everybody comes out of the woodwork to defend their rights&hellip;..but they create<br>
hurdles for industrious people like myself <br>
but it&rsquo;s alright&hellip;.my letter to the editor about this was published exposing the hypocrisy of the so-called do-gooders who use taxpayers money to benifit those they deem worthy of it.</p>

			<p>This should be a no brainer&hellip;lower costs for those who should not be in the country in the first place. But in today&rsquo;s upside down world I would bet the court rules in favor of the illegals. Madness is afoot in this country and with Obama we can be sure it will only get worse, if that&rsquo;s possible. </p>

			<p>One of my favorite fantasies is being able to go back in time to, say, 1955 with a notebook of current day news clippings.  Tuition for illegal immigrants, homosexual marriage, whites now less than 65% of the population and declining every year, a trillion dollar financial bail out and a president who wants to spend a trillion more, all of it borrowed from foreigners   &mdash;   they&rsquo;d lock me up, they&rsquo;d never believe this sort of stuff could happen to their country.</p>
<p>Given that the courts have decided that states have to pay for the primary school education of children of illegal immigrants, my guess is that the California Supreme Court will back the illegals.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;The state of California in the midst of a budget crisis and likely bankruptcy wants to top-off the public education stolen from the taxpayers by the illegals with a college education to prepare them for jobs it is illegal to give them. And the politicians and the voters that elect them see nothing wrong here?</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a solution: charge the home governments of these students for their tuition.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;This is one of the many reasons why California is a  state now facing bankruptcy. Whites are fleeing, property values are plummeting, and La Raza is &ldquo;peacefully&rdquo; transpiring via the White exodus and the high illegal birthrate. Consider the place Mexico. All of the ills you think of when you think of Mexico, know that they apply to Mexifornia now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the extremely anti White, anti American pro illegal immigration Los Angeles Times admits that a full 40 percent of the population of Los Angeles at any one time is on welfare.  That&rsquo;s straight welfare, not disability, unemployment, student grants or retirement.  40 percent on welfare and the Los Angeles Times and the rest of the power elite of California continue to rejoice in the Mexican take over despite the 15 billion dollar deficit the state is facing.  </p>
<p>The deficit is due to:</p>
<p>(1) Hispanics on welfare</p>
<p>(2) Hispanics on medical and other free medical services such as clinics and emergency rooms.</p>
<p>(3) Hispanics in prison, the criminal justice system such as waiting for trial, Probation officers, attorneys, etc, hispanics getting free medical care, monopolizing public housing, extra services for their children such as free school breakfast, lunch and snack etc, etc, etc</p>
<p>(4) Hispanics working for either cash and thus not paying taxes or hispanics whose immigrant employers deduct payroll taxes from paychecks but fail to send the payroll taxes to government agencies such as unemployment, social security, workmen&rsquo;s comp etc.</p>
<p>(5) Immigrant businesses that pay no income, corporate or even sales tax.</p>
<p>(6) 30 years of the downward pressure on wages due entirely to cheap hispanic labor.  Because of the downward effect on wages, less taxes are paid including sales tax.  The downward effect on wages means that while workers pay less taxes, including sales tax, even those in full time work or even working 2 jobs need welfare in the form of food stamps, free school lunches for their kids and other supplemental welfare benefits for low wage earners.</p>
<p>I wonder what the elite will do in 50 years when they have to contend with potholed roads and freeways, cholera epidemics, sewer back ups, electrical shutdowns, constant demands for bribery, kidnappings and other aspects of the Mexican way of life.</p>

			<p>I missed this story, and it might have been because of the barage of stories, like this, that newspapers in California print everday. As a resident, you become jaded. Here is an outright case of treason, disrimination and betrayel by Californias democratic politicians against American citizens and yet,it doesn&rsquo;t even reach the Main Stream News Media.</p>
