<h1>Mother Fights 15-Mile Bus Ride</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Diversity to help keep Wake County schools integrated and academically healthy has a cost that Beteena Person says her Southeast Raleigh neighborhood shouldn&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>But under Wake&rsquo;s proposed reassignment plan, Person&rsquo;s neighborhood would be transferred to a school 15 miles from her home. That&rsquo;s 2 1/2 times the distance to its current school, and the new school operates on a different schedule  &mdash;  a year-round calendar.</p>
<p>Person&rsquo;s children would be forced to switch to reduce the percentage of low-income students at Smith Elementary School in Garner. School leaders agreed to make this kind of change to end a standoff with town officials and get permission from Garner leaders to renovate Smith.</p>
<p>School leaders hope to replace Person&rsquo;s neighborhood with more-affluent students who might apply for Smith&rsquo;s new magnet program. But Person doesn&rsquo;t see why her children have to move.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Board members have heard very little from minority parents, especially those from Southeast Raleigh, such as Person.</p>
<p>Most of the feedback has come from white, suburban parents who are upset about their children changing schools. Person said those families are being asked to travel much shorter distances than the Southeast Raleigh children who may be bused more than 20 miles to school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under Wake&rsquo;s diversity policy, some Southeast Raleigh children travel to Garner and even farther away to North Raleigh and western Wake.</p>
<p>School leaders point to research showing that academic performance suffers at schools that have too many low-income students. They try to ensure that no school is overwhelmed by students from poor families or those with limited skill in English or with other special needs.</p>
<p>Garner community leaders have complained that Wake buses too many Southeast Raleigh students into the town&rsquo;s schools. They say that having so many high-poverty schools is hurting development in Garner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Garner&rsquo;s complaints about low-income children from Southeast Raleigh angered Person. She points out that her children received subsidized lunches when she first took them in as foster children. But now that she and her husband have adopted them, her children pay for their meals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Person said her family moved from North Raleigh in 2006 in order to find a more-affordable home. She said they wanted to save on housing costs to pay for extras such as taekwondo and dance for their children.</p>

<p>Someone wasted time and money on this &#8220;research&#8221;??</p>
<p>Of course &#8220;low-income&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;non-white&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Are there any doubts in anyone&rsquo;s mind after reading this that we really have to bring back segregation? All kidding aside, it really seems to be the only viable solution.</p>

			<p>from the article - &#8220;School leaders point to research showing that academic performance suffers at schools that have too many low-income students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then how can it be justified to subject the white students to these &#8220;low income&#8221; students that cause performance levels to deteriorate? It&rsquo;s time somebody used the very same research the forced desegregationists are using as the basis for a lawsuit against forced desegregation.</p>

			<p>We teach our children at home so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about nonsense such as this.  We also don&rsquo;t celebrate black history month or take off for MLK day.  </p>
<p>People often ask about the &#8220;socialization&#8221; aspect of homeshooling and I point out that we have much more control over who our children are around.  Between girl-scouts (all white and all homeschooled troop of 44 girls), ballet (all white except one half-asian girl), art class (all white), literature class (all white), Sunday school (one black, one asian), gymnastics (all white), swimming (all white), and piano lessons our children are around other children several hours a day every day of the week.  The important thing is that we get to choose how this happens and our decisions aren&rsquo;t affected by a new busing policy.</p>
<p>For those who say that our children don&rsquo;t get to learn about black people I assure them that this isn&rsquo;t the case at all.  About once a year we take them down to the black area of town and make them go play at an otherwise all black park.  The blacks are always mean, ill-mannered, and loud.  Our four girls inevitably end up crying and frustrated that the blacks don&rsquo;t take turns, push them down, constantly scream and call them names, and try and take anything our children are playing with.  After my wife and I feel this years lesson has been learned we return to our white neighborhood and let them play at the neighborhood park and swim in the pool.  The contrasting behavior is really amazing and teaches them a valuable lesson that I don&rsquo;t want them to have to learn by going to school with blacks.</p>

I&rsquo;ve said it before. Most blacks could care less about integration. It&rsquo;s a small group of vocal black activists who are forcing this on their own people against their will.</p>
<p>More blacks need to tell their so-called &#8216;leaders&rsquo; to shut up.</p>
<p>Black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; talk about black self-esteem all the time. What message does it send to black kids that their worth is determined by sitting next to white kids? Talk about a message of self-esteem.</p>

<p>That will never happen. Those &#8220;leaders&#8221; are the equivalent of African tribal chieftains. That makes them &#8220;kings,&#8221; and for blacks &#8220;the king can do no wrong.&#8221; That&rsquo;s why Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton can rip off their own kind to the tune of millions of dollars for years on end, and why corrupt thugs like Coleman Young, Marion Barry and Ray Nagin get re-elected over and over again.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t hold your breath in the coming years waiting for the blacks to turn on Obama when his grandiose campaign promises vanish like so much dust in the wind. He is the ultimate &#8220;king,&#8221; so he can laugh in their faces as he screws them over, and they&rsquo;ll come back for more. Think of them as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_house#Omegas" rel="nofollow">Omega pledges</a> who must respond to every whack on the butt with a meek &#8220;Thank you, sir, may I have another?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Look on the bright side, all the white kids that are sent to black schools get a chance to learn how to jump.</p>

			<p>When I read about busing in the US I always wonder why our environmetalists are so silent. Busing costs fuel and produces carbon dioxide and, unlike other applications of motor traffic, nobody wants it and nobody likes it. The students don&rsquo;t like it, the parents don&rsquo;t like it, the teachers don&rsquo;t like it. There are only some politicians bent on a crazy ideology who force it down other peoples&rsquo; throats.</p>

			<p>When are these moron going to learn what the rest of the world learned 100 years ago. Poverty has nothing whatsoever to do with educational achievement. A quality education needs only three things. A brain to absorb it, ambition to achieve it and the basic tools of learning. If any of the three are missing it is bound to fail.</p>

			<p>People with children tend to pick the school first and the house second.  I knew a white family in Florida who literally lived across the street from their daughter&rsquo;s white majority school.  She was bussed to a crime infested black majority inner city school that was an hour and a half bus ride away.  </p>
<p>Bussing is an admission that government believes black teachers in black schools are inferior to white teachers in white schools.  And government will never admit that bussing black students to white schools does nothing to improve their grades&hellip;   </p>

			<p>She ought to meet some 40 to 50 year old Los Angeles blacks.  </p>
<p>Many of them were bussed 60 miles, a 120 mile round trip every school day from the far south east to the far north west of Los Angeles.  With Los Angeles traffic, many got car sick.  It was about 3 hours totally lost time in the day.  Those 3 hours of total boredom led of course to fights and squabbles.</p>
<p>Then there was the problem of waking up at 5/am to get to their neighborhood high schools at 6/15 to board the bus for the trip north.</p>
<p>I know a black woman who went to Woodland Hills High School from a neighborhood 60 miles away.  She was on all the sports teams, so she had to stay till 4/30 for practice.  She seldom got home before 7/pm.</p>
<p>She is still bitter about it.</p>

			<p>* Did you ever notice how black people have an uncanny knack of turning their problems into white peoples&rsquo; problems? The transfer of low income students to (formerly) white schools is a classic exapmple.</p>
<p>* The issue of school integration is just an example of &#8220;the best defense is a good offense&#8221;. Keep the focus off the failure of blacks schools by putting white people on the defensive.</p>

			<p>I was subject to forced integration (I think they called it &#8220;desegregation&#8221;) back in the 70&rsquo;s.  1/2 the kids in my suburban school were loaded onto busses early in the morning for an hour ride to a school in the inner city.  Conversely, 1/2 of the kids from that inner city school were bussed to my elementary school.  It was my first experience with people of other races, and I was assaulted twice in the first week.  I have no idea what happened to my friends that were shipped to the city.  My father moved my family to another town to spare me further harm.</p>
<p>That exercise was a complete failure and was canned soon after it started.  It only taught me to avoid people of other colors, a lesson I&rsquo;ve carried ever since.  Why the government would try the same thing again thirty years later sickens me.</p>

			<p>I had a dose of bussing when I was in the 3rd grade. Having always been in schools with almost all white kids, suddenly I was in a school with a lot of black kids, most of whom saw me as easy pickings. It was like being thrown into a prison movie. </p>

			<p> I agree with Colonel Taylor. I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a long time: &#8220;There are a lot of broken white neighborhoods but their are also a lot of all white neighborhoods. We must keep them that way at ALL costs! Each neighborhood would have a town council declaring their neighborhood &#8220;whites only.&#8221; Only whites would be allowed in. The beauty in this is we wouldn&rsquo;t have to kick anybody out, just keep them from coming in. Doesn&rsquo;t this make sense instead of always fleeing? We are going to run out of desirable places soon.&#8221; We have a right to live among our own. Let the minorities build up their own neighborhoods.</p>
