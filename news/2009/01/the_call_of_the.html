			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Economist, January 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>IN THE H-Mart supermarket at the new Diamond Jamboree shopping centre, customers can peruse more than 60 shelf-feet (18 metres) of kimchi. A heavily Asian clientele buys seaweed, dried pollock and live catfish. A few doors down, the new 85ºC Bakery churns out the soft brioche rolls beloved by the Taiwanese  &mdash;  up to 700 of them every day.</p>
<p>A common enough sight in an inner-city ethnic ghetto, perhaps. But this is Irvine, a scrupulously tidy suburban city south of Los Angeles that is only about one-third Asian. The shopping centre is surrounded not by overcrowded tenement buildings but by light manufacturing firms. It is a new kind of ethnic community, and an extremely popular one.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King once described Sunday mornings, when people go to church, as the most segregated moment in American life. That is probably still true. But, particularly for groups other than blacks, Saturday mornings are not far behind. A century ago ethnic-minority groups clustered for self-defence, or because they were forced to. Half a century ago they were bound together by language and poverty. Now they congregate to eat and shop.</p>
<p>Despite the housing-market crash, immigrants and ethnic minorities continue to leave inner-city ghettos for more mixed suburbs. That movement has forced other changes. Research by Gary Orfield of the University of California at Los Angeles shows that in 1988 the average white public-school pupil went to a school that was 83.4% white. That proportion had fallen to 76.6% by 2006. In the West more than a fifth of white children attended mixed-race schools, with at least 10% of students from three or more ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Every year California&rsquo;s schools cope with fewer children who cannot speak English. The proportion of Los Angeles Latinos who are fluent in the language has risen from 52% to 58% since 2000, according to the Census Bureau. Some 660,000 of them (16% of the total) speak no Spanish at all. But assimilation has not eradicated differences in taste.</p>
<p>The Diamond Jamboree centre&rsquo;s customers are among the most affluent Asians in Irvine. Many of the teenagers sipping sweet iced coffee are students from the local outpost of the University of California. Women push mixed-race children in prams. Eddie Lam, whose Chinese restaurant had its grand opening this week, reports that at least four-fifths of his Asian customers order their food in English.</p>
<p>Much English can also be heard at Plaza Mexico, a shopping centre in south Los Angeles. There, men photograph their children in front of ersatz Mayan fountains and what looks like a Baroque church (actually a market where you can buy shoes, basketball shirts and pet rabbits). It is an odd sight. But many of these urban Latinos have never seen a real Mexican village.</p>
<p>José Legaspi, who has turned several dying malls into thriving Hispanic shopping centres, says the appeal of such places goes well beyond their Mexican flourishes. The shops often have wider aisles for big family groups, as well as more entertainment for children. The sales patter is different, especially acknowledging men&rsquo;s pride in providing for their families. (English-speaking shoppers, by contrast, are &#8220;independent Marlboro men&#8221;.)</p>
<p>More surprising than the rise of ethnic shopping centres outside traditional neighbourhoods is what has happened to those neighbourhoods. Most are no longer the population centres of their communities, and many now play host to other groups. Los Angeles&rsquo;s Koreatown is largely, and increasingly, Hispanic. Yet businesses catering to Koreans are thriving, and the district has even expanded. Suburban visitors explain how one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Los Angeles can sustain expensive shoe shops and diamond jewellers.</p>
<p>Or take Queens in New York. The home of the fictional bigot Archie Bunker is now one of the most ethnically diverse communities in the country. More than 140 languages are spoken there, and more than a third of the population is foreign-born. Many apartment buildings are &#8220;like the United Nations&#8221;, according to Joseph Salvo of New York City&rsquo;s planning department. A steadily rising number of subdivisions, he says, contain no racial majority.</p>
<p>What seem like ethnic enclaves in Queens are often something else. Leaving the 7 subway line, the &#8220;immigrant express&#8221;, at the 74th Street stop, the visitor finds himself in what appears to be a South Asian neighbourhood. There are shops selling saris and Indian jewellery, a Patel Brothers supermarket and Indian restaurants. Yet nearby flats are mostly occupied by immigrants from Central America. The shops are patronised by South Asians who travel into the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Ethnic communities that are based on shopping are, of course, not nearly so monolithic as ones rooted in language and neighbourhood. Latinos also go to Gap, as well as to Asian supermarkets like 99 Ranch. And Mr Legaspi points out that another change is quietly afoot. Gradually, he says, central Americans are assimilating into the broader Hispanic culture  &mdash;  a process he labels &#8220;Mexicanisation&#8221;.</p>
<p>A similar trend can be seen in Irvine&rsquo;s new shopping centre. The shelves in H-Mart contain Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese foods, as well as American breakfast cereal. The menu in Mr Lam&rsquo;s restaurant includes Vietnamese and Cambodian dishes as well as Chinese ones. The people who frequent centres like this one are not so much clinging to their parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; ways as creating a new culture that is both pan-Asian and American. King would probably not have objected.<br>

			<p>I have been to that 74th street area in Queens. Hispanics do not shop in South Asian places and South Asians do not shop in Hispanic places overwhelmingly. The mixing is true obviously because of anti-discrimination law and the fact that it is very tough to make much money in America, especially for immigrants who rent to other immigrants. And the fact that there is assimilation is not a good thing unlike what some of the nationalists here want. And does anyone notice mixed-race suburbs are quickly not suburbs anymore. Queens is a big example. Queens is one big trash dump with some minor exceptions. I used to live in the best areas and those areas are gone. And southern and western Nassau County are quickly turning into the demographic dumps that New York City is.</p>

			<p>Maybe this is a little off topic, but here goes anyway. The politicians around Orlando want to build a light rail system. Of course, with all the usual graft connected to it, it will probably come in at something like five times the original cost and three years too late( See the Big Dig in Boston). Anyhow, one terminus of the line is a well-to-do enclave of Orlando called Winter Park. The people there don&rsquo;t want this boondoggle and have said they will not cooperate with or fund it. Could it be that they read what happened to those shopping centers in St. Louis ? The thugs from the slums would ride the rails into the malls, commit their crimes, and skeedaddle away on the trains.</p>

			<p><b>Translation</b>: <i>We&rsquo;d just like to inform our white, middle-class readers that - while non-white ethnic enclaves celebrating their own exclusive festivals and culture are a sight to gush and weep over in &#8220;Multicultural America&#8221; - you are bland and boring without a little (actually <b>a lot</b>) of &#8216;colour&rsquo; in your life, while your festivals and culture can be co-opted by any non-white that desires as much:<br>
The most you can hope for is to marry your daughter off to a black chappy and/or your son to an (East) Asian, and hope the world is never cursed by your boring race again (as your grandchildren marry blacks/Asians, the offspring of which marry blacks/Asians&hellip;).</i></p>

			<p>This is just a report of the new existential reality brought about by the 1965 Immigration Act. Remember 1950s America was too boring, too Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, too&hellip;White. So now we have a Tower of Babel in it&rsquo;s place.</p>

As Gaurav Ahuja noted, forced integration only means that people live in close proximity because by law they have that right. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to like each other or even interact.</p>
<p>I used to live in Manhattan in the mid 1980&rsquo;s. Although I could ride the subway and walk the streets and pass different races and ethnics, no one in my circle of friends and casual acquaintances were non-white. The restaurants I ate in and the bars I drank at were white with infrequent non-whites.</p>
<p>While &#8220;diversity&#8221; was all around me, I didn&rsquo;t partake. By law, everyone had the right to be where they were but I always had the ultimate choice of who I wanted to assocate with.</p>

			<p>Is this supposed to be a bad thing? Let them keep to themselves. God knows that I don&rsquo;t want to see too many of them at Dean &amp; De Luca, Balducci&rsquo;s or Wholefoods. I don&rsquo;t mind paying more and shopping at gourmet grocery stores provided they are priced out. In the end, I get better quality of food in a better environment&hellip; kind of like what the suburbs are all about?</p>
<p>Everywhere I go, and I live in NYC, I&rsquo;m surrounded by whites and I want to keep it that way. When I walk into the Wholefoods on the LES or Dean &amp; De Luca in Soho, it&rsquo;s nothing but whites. The only blacks are the people mopping the floor and working the registers. All the best restaurants have an almost exclusively white clientele. Blacks eat at BBQ&rsquo;s and McDonald&rsquo;s- hence the 80% obesity rate! I care too much about myself to put that poison in my body. </p>
<p>When you go into an all-natural, organic corner-store, grocery store, juice bar, or bodega in NYC, you notice that is all young, educated white people taking care of themselves. It has nothing to do with money either. Eating healthy can be quite affordable in NYC if you&rsquo;re willing to put effort into it. I see young whites in college or working in low paying jobs still eating in such places- they&rsquo;re investing in their health and longevity!</p>
<p>I recently read that NYC is the 5th most obese city in the USA. This is probably true but only because there are so many blacks and Hispanics. White people take care of themselves and lead active lives. On the subway, I&rsquo;m confronted with fat black people taking up twice as much seat space and exiting on the stairs is a  nightmare if there are two of them in front of you.</p>
<p>Now if only they could jack up the price of movies to $20! I would gladly pay it. Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to sit through a flick with Shaniqua talking and her phone going off every 30 minutes.</p>

			<p>&#8221; The sales patter is different, especially acknowledging men&rsquo;s pride in providing for their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this in Los Angeles advertising and public service announcements.  There is a very effective anti smoking ad that implies that if Dad doesn&rsquo;t smoke the kids will follow his example and grow up to be healthy and successful.  Furnture and other ads often emphasis that Dad earned the money and that chooses wisely.</p>
