			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Crilly, Times of London, January 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The combined talents of Aretha Franklin, Joe Biden and Yo-Yo Ma failed to silence the drinkers at the Urafiki Green Pub in the heart of Kibera, Africa&rsquo;s biggest slum.</p>
<p>Thousands gathered in the narrow dirt alleys and dusty clearings of the slum to enjoy the moment, chanting &#8220;Yes we can&#8221;. Hush fell only when the tiny television set in the corner of the ramshackle bar room filled with the distinctive features of America&rsquo;s 44th President.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man is Jesus,&#8221; shouted one man, spilling his Guinness as Barack Obama began his inaugural address. &#8220;When will he come to Kenya to save us?&#8221; If Barack Obama&rsquo;s spin doctors have been trying to lower expectations since his election victory, the message clearly has not reached the land of his father.</p>
<p>Millions of people around the country thronged giant TV screens or crammed into bars to watch the inauguration of a man viewed as Kenya&rsquo;s best hope of a prosperous and happy future.</p>
<p>In some ways his first success was simply to unit a country fractured along tribal lines. Last year the country imploded in a wave of political violence. Last night the inauguration of the grandson of a Kenyan goatherd as US President did more to bring the country together than the efforts of its own corrupt politicians.</p>
<p>Kepha Ngito, who runs youth projects in Kibera, said: &#8220;This is something all Kenyans can enjoy. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what tribe you belong to. This is for all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many slum residfents missed the concluding moments of the inauguration when a makeshift cinema  &mdash;  a sheet pinned to a wall with a projector and a borrowed aerial  &mdash;  failed, but no-one much cared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he is president we will get food and jobs,&#8221; said Ben Ochieng, as he danced to the traditional music that replaced the planned show.</p>
<p>All week Kenya had been gearing up for Mr Obama&rsquo;s moment of glory. Newspapers have published souvenir editions, countless goats have been slaughtered for the party and a popular local brew, Senator beer, has been renamed President for the occasion.</p>
<p>The Kenya National Theatre even revived its hit show Obama The Musical, which wowed sell-out audiences during the US election last year. It uses parallels with the Bible Story and Mr Obama&rsquo;s own struggles with racism and drugs  &mdash;  documented in his memoir Dreams From My Father  &mdash;  to portray the incoming President as a saviour for downtrodden peoples of the world.</p>
<p>George Orido, the show&rsquo;s artistic director, said Mr Obama&rsquo;s story was an inspiration to ordinary Kenyans. &#8220;The main message for my show is that anything is possible if you believe and work hard at it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s important because I come from a part of the world which has been written off by the rest of the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenya is a country in need of a saviour. Last year 600,000 people were left homeless by the violence that followed disputed presidential elections.</p>
<p>This year some 10 million are at risk of hunger, prompting the government to declare a national emergency last week.</p>
<p>While Mr Obama may have been elected by American voters, here he is viewed as a Kenyan president. And Kenyan politicians are supposed to look after their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is right that when people get power they look after their family, so we know that Obama will build lots of good things for us, like schools and roads and clinics,&#8221; said George Opiyo as he left the theatre.</p>
<p>In Kogelo, the tiny village that the Obama family calls home, thousands thronged the grounds of the local school as Kenyans took a day off work to party. Luo dancers from Mr Obama&rsquo;s tribe draped in monkey skins put on a traditional show, while onlooker waved American flags.</p>
<p>Here the benefits of the Obama presidency are already being felt. The government moved quickly after his November victory to bring modern amenities to the tiny homestead that had been left behind by the 21st century.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredible opportunity for us, because a lot of investment will come,&#8221; said 20-year-old Faith Achieng. &#8220;It&rsquo;s already thanks to him we have electricity and water.&#8221; Not bad for a man trying to play down his tag as the &#8220;chosen one&#8221;.<br>

			<p>This idiotic belief that Obama is going to save them only serves to more firmly cement my recent realisation that adult Blacks are simply children in larger bodies.</p>
<p>It blows my mind that these infants will rally in the millions to cut each other to pieces with machetes, yet fail to gather a group of 4 men together to dig a lousy well or plant a field of corn.</p>
<p>How long do you suppose it would take for a half-white man to be elected to any office in Kenya, much less the highest office in the land?</p>

<p>You can tell from that one statement that Africans have no idea what the office of president means. Even if he wanted to do something for the folks back home the rest of the world would see it as an insult if they were left out of favor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that blacks here in America have similar expectations. Obama is in a trap that he made for himself.The very minute he tries to do something for one group all the other supporters are going to feel they are not getting their fair share of the spoils. Blacks are quick to turn on their own and when he can&rsquo;t deliver as they believe he can they will not be happy. </p>

<p>If this wasn&rsquo;t also just as pathetically absurd a demonstration of what so many &#8220;Americans&rsquo;&#8221; views of this charlatan are, this would almost evoke a strange or even sympathetic sadness regarding the Kenyans. It is the &#8220;otherworldly&#8221; quality of this Obamania, that spans the planet, that is most peculiar. Just what do they all expect this fool to do, split atoms into gold dust when he has flatulence?  </p>
<p>They are in for a shock, if that is the case; he will be no better, but also hopefully no worse, than the last two idiots to sit in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>Otherwise, God help us all!</p>

			<p>When I read these white heart, tales from the center of Africa pieces I sometimes wonder if the natives are making fun of the whites, &#8220;The white man was the best thing to ever happen to Africa and whites are the only leaders I could ever trust&#8221;. Then it has me wondering about the earlier story on AmRen &#8216;Deliquents say Obama has them cured&rsquo;. Frankly, I would make fun of the media too. That is if I ever consented to appear on the news, which I wouldn&rsquo;t. Well, maybe I would talk to AmRen&rsquo;s reporter. </p>

Regardless of what civics and social studies classes American blacks took, in their heart and soul, they believe in the &#8216;big chief syndrome&rsquo;. They believe their &#8216;big chief&rsquo; has won and therefore has the right and the power to do anything and everything he wants.</p>
<p>American blacks fully expect him to do things &#8216;the right way, the black way&rsquo; which is why when President Obama doesn&rsquo;t deliver, they&rsquo;re going to be disappointed and charge him with not being black enough.</p>

			<p>In reading the referenced article, I noticed that 3 of the 4 Africans had typical Western names: Ben, George, and Faith. Kepha, the fourth, is distinctly African. This brings up a question: Why do Africans, in Africa, have normal names, but, in America, they delight in absurd names? Names that are not African, to reflect their African origins, but linguistic deformations of standard names or irregular combinations of letters. An example is Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson, a musician, scheduled to be on Jimmy Fallon&rsquo;s new talk show.</p>

			<p>No doubt Obama will open the floodgates and allow yet more Africans to move from Kenya, Somalia, et al, to the United States. The phrase &#8216;Out of Africa&rsquo; has taken on new meaning. After having forced whites and Asians out of Africa, blacks are now realizing that there&rsquo;s nothing worth staying for and are hastily exiting the continent themselves. I swear there are way more Somalis in the developed world than in Africa. Can Kenyans be far behind?</p>

			<p>Wow the comments sterotyping blacks especially those in Africa are appaulling. Do you realize these people are less fortunate due to an extremely corrupt government. When given an oppurtunity to work or learn these people will take it.</p>
<p>As some who has traveled to Africa three times to four countries I can tell you from first hand experience that those people have been through hell and back. But dispite what they go through people there still want to learn and work for the improvement of their individual nations. Some kids love to read and go to school.</p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t realize America is going down the drain, that should be your major focus not what some poor, starving, people think who have never had the oppurtunity to success </p>

From the dullest to the smartest, Obama supporters are looking for a handout.  When I talk to my worthless nephew, I see the same thing.  Somehow, with BHO in power, a high-paying job with no heavy lifting will come his way.  Bring on the New Great Depression.</p>

			<p>This is so absurd. As absurd as the American media and it&rsquo;s fawning over a man that got elected simply because 1. the color of his skin and because of the millions that voted for him because they hated George Bush more.  </p>
<p>He has a murky and shady past.  Alliances with corrupt Chicago politicians, domestic terrorists and racist preachers.  Either the people that voted for him don&rsquo;t believe his past or they just don&rsquo;t care.  </p>
<p>In any event, it is my belief, along with a lot of people that Obama became the 44th President because and only because he is at least part black.</p>
<p>As for the Kenyans, their as bad as the blacks in this country who said during the campaign that they wanted Obama to win because he was going to pay their rent and car payments.</p>

			<p>If there was any doubt about the infantile state of so many black minds they have been laid to rest.  I will probably be one of the very few Americans who isn&rsquo;t disappointed by Obama because my expectations are very low to begin with.  (Not that I saw McCain as being any better.)</p>
<p>What is impressive to me are the massive fawning of the media and the triumphalism of the local (NYC) blacks.  As I walk to work I see them selling T-shirts with Obama and McCain depicted as boxers, with McCain flat on his back after being KOed by Obama.  Never did I see such T-shirts when Bush defeated Gore, or Clinton defeated Bush Sr.  Whites may insist it&rsquo;s not a black vs. white thing but black people certainly see it that way.<br>

<p>I keep wondering what these people (and the people of other African countries) were like before the whites (or Arabs) arrived.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any good books? I probably wouldn&rsquo;t trust any written in the last 60 years, used in African Studies courses and such.</p>
<p>I have no doubt they were just as childlike, but I&rsquo;m wondering if they had social/&#8221;political&#8221; structures that held them together better than they are held together now.</p>
<p>Their present structures seem like a superposition of an Idiocracy version of Western structures on top of tribal values and relations.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m sorry but you are incorrect rational thinker. Have you checked the high school drop out rates in Detroit recently? This is a sterotype (sic) based on facts. Nepotism and cronyism are typical of black leaders. Another stereotype based on fact. That&rsquo;s why blacks are looking for handouts from Obama. The problem is that the President of the United States does not have this kind of power. If you want to see this in practice, look at black mayors. Soon the entire city government is black and blacks get city contracts, etc. Usually the city goes down the drain as a result.</p>

<p>It seems that every White school teacher, college professor and student, media millionaire pontificator, journalist, and other idiot intellectuals in America worship Obama as much as do these Africans.</p>
<p>At least the Africans are looking for concrete, achievable things, like food, electronics, housing.</p>
<p>The idiot intellectual White Americans who worship Obama expect him to achieve heaven on earth in the next 6 months.</p>

<p>Newspaper claims suspect transformed into a goat <br>
Friday, January 23, 2009 Yahoo News</p>
<p>LAGOS, Nigeria – One of Nigeria&rsquo;s biggest daily newspapers reported that police implicated a goat in an attempted automobile theft. In a front-page article on Friday, the Vanguard newspaper said that two men tried to steal a Mazda car two days earlier in Kwara State, with one suspect transforming himself into a goat as vigilantes cornered him</p>
<p>Do those 21,000 Nigerian physicians now practicing in the United States believe like the Nigerian police that men can transform themselves into goats?</p>
<p>How much did those Nigerian physicians pay for their transcripts?<br>
Who took their medical boards for them and how much were the professional test takers paid?  Enquiring minds want to know.</p>
