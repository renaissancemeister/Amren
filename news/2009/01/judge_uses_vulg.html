			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edmund H. Mahony and Jon Lender, Hartford (Connecticut) Courant, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Repeatedly using vulgar and racial insults, Superior Court Judge E. Curtissa Cofield argued with a police officer  &mdash;  addressing him as &#8220;Negro trooper&#8221; at one point  &mdash;  who was trying to process her on a charge of drunken driving in Glastonbury last October, a police video released Monday shows.</p>
<p>Cofield also is heard twice on the video using the racial term &#8220;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  .&#8221;</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s Judicial Review Council released the video Monday after it found cause to pursue five judicial misconduct charges against her, several of them based on what was termed disparaging, demeaning or &#8220;racially inappropriate&#8221; language.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The video shows an uncooperative Cofield continually interrupting state police Sgt. Dwight Washington, who was asking a series of questions while processing her on the DUI charge at the Glastonbury police headquarters.</p>
<p>At 2:17 a.m. on Oct. 10, nearly two hours into the booking at headquarters, Cofield is seated at a desk and calls her husband on her cellphone. Washington, who like Cofield is black, is standing about 3 feet away.</p>
<p>Her end of the conversation, in part, is: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t need a ride home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;m a criminal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What? What? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, they got the head n  &mdash;    &mdash;   in charge and he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Which one, the head n  &mdash;    &mdash;   in charge? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Washington. OK. That&rsquo;s H-N-I-G.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she hands the phone to Washington, who talks to her husband about getting the car off the highway. Washington asks, &#8220;Do you guys have Triple-A?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing that, Cofield interjects: &#8220;Oh, no. We don&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re ghetto Negroes. We don&rsquo;t have Triple-A.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, when asked if she was injured, Cofield replied: &#8220;Yeah, I am. I&rsquo;m humiliated by your f  &mdash;    &mdash;  g attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if she was ill, Cofield replied, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sick of being treated like a freaking Negro from the &#8216;hood,&#8221; and added: &#8220;Write it down, write it. Did you hear what I just said?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what her illness was, Cofield said: &#8220;Negro-itis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you need to take any medication now?&#8221; Washington asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I need to take anti-Negro, ummm  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington asked if she was willing to take an intoxication test. She replied: &#8220;Mr. Negro Washington. I need to go to the bathroom, and then I will take the test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s Sgt. Washington,&#8221; he replied, adding, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t disrespect me, and I won&rsquo;t disrespect you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At another moment, after she had given a urine sample, Cofield asked Washington: &#8220;Do you have a reading on my urine test, Negro trooper?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then she directed her attention to the first state trooper on the scene of her accident and asked him, &#8220;Can you tell me why you came first, and then you had to bring him [Washington]? Is it because you had to make this valid by bringing a Negro?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cofield was originally appointed in 1991 as the state&rsquo;s first black female judge after Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. nominated her and legislators confirmed her. She was last renominated by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and approved by lawmakers in 2007. Her current term expires on June 6, 2015.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 10:45 p.m. on Oct. 9, Cofield, 60, was driving through a highway construction zone on Route 2 in Glastonbury when her car sideswiped a parked state police cruiser occupied by Trooper Michael Kowal. Prosecutor John Whalen said that the judge&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot and that she smelled of alcohol. Urine samples showed her blood alcohol content was 0.16 percent at 1 a.m. on Oct. 10 and 0.17 percent at 2:04 a.m., he said  &mdash;  twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent.</p>
<p>State legislators had been hoping to view the video, and now will be able to do so and consider whatever decision the Judicial Review Council makes. Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, co-chairman of the legislative judicial committee, has said that lawmakers could theoretically seek Cofield&rsquo;s removal.</p>
<p>He said Monday he believes that the council &#8220;will consider whether to recommend that she be removed as a judge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think in many ways the ball is in Judge Cofield&rsquo;s court to convince them that she deserves to remain on the bench. I think if any legislator, any judge, any prosecutor, any police officer, did the exact same thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they probably would end up losing their job.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This woman will deservedly lose her job due to outrageous behavior.  She will also be punished by the Bar.  The cop acted responsibly.  It will be interesting how she explains her behavior.  In the meantime, she will voluntarily enroll in alcohol counseling, the usual route to mitigate damages.</p>

			<p>Rather than comment on the racial comments etc. of Judge Cofield to her fellow African American, I&rsquo;d like to make a different observation about judges and the legal system in the U.S. in general. It is out of control. The system and those that are a part of it are utterly out of control. It is well known that many judges take bribes for various reasons, they act like little gods and take liberties with citizens, they do not enforce laws or enforce them selectively,and many are just plain derilect in their duties, etc. I could go on for twenty pages over the things I have read about concerning the idiots in the legal system and how they abuse the American public dailey  &mdash;  the young &#8220;legal boys&#8221;, the more experienced lawyers, the judges, the police,etc. In the above story Sgt. Washington displays a lot of character and more than patience, with the judge who is abusing him, and should have her butt fired, because her arrogance and no doubt, affirmative action caused attitude is sickening.</p>

			<p>I doubt that any of us &#8220;haters&#8221; here at Amren would have treated Sgt. Washington with the extraordinary disrespect that Cofield did, even if drunk.</p>

			<p>She did a very foolish thing. If she had only been arrested for drunk driving, all would have been forgiven because of &#8220;black skin privilege,&#8221; but because she threw around racial epithets, even blacks won&rsquo;t defend her. She&rsquo;s in big trouble now!!!</p>

<p>It will be interesting how she explains her behavior.</p>
<p>She will claim that years of White oppression and racism led to alcohol abuse and her behavior that night. White Liberal psychologists and psychiatrists will rush to her aid with fabricated statistical &#8220;proof&#8221; that Judge Cofield was suffering from years of exposure to racism and oppression from Whites, which caused her to succumb to alcohol abuse and lash out in defense of her civil rights. </p>
<p>Her White apologizers will affirm in court that she was not responsible for her behavior that night, but still claim that it was completely justified as a consequence of the racism she&rsquo;s endured all of her life.</p>
<p>Further, the media sources that posted the video will be accused of racism for posting the video of the helpless, victimized judge. They may be sued for slander.</p>
<p>The arresting Black officer will initially be labeled as an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; in the Black community, but, he will ultimately be absolved of any guilt in the eyes of Blacks, who will be made to realize (by White Liberals) that he too was acting under the duress of the &#8220;White&#8221; system for which he is not responsible.</p>
<p>Obama will step in and urge community reconciliation and forgiveness and suggest that further atonement is needed from Whites. He will call for Whites to pay higher taxes to fund higher &#8220;refunds&#8221; (code word for reparations) for Blacks as a measure to begin the healing process of Black victims of racism like Judge Cofield and Officer Washington.</p>
<p>Write it down and set your watch by it. I&rsquo;ll wager that I am not far off the mark.</p>

			<p>Want to lose respect for blacks.. live around them, that is the cure. This black trash judge should be jailed but will she be beyond a day?  She should be judged at a higher standard but then again blacks seem to have their own standards of humanity if you can call it that?</p>

More proof blacks selectively target whites for &#8216;hate&rsquo; speech. If these words were truly offensive as blacks insist, they would be equally offensive uttered by blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate&#8221; crime laws were created only to be used against whites.</p>

			<p>Judge Colfield&rsquo;s comments reflect the same sort of persecution complex that afflicts people who seem to find themselves in constant conflict with the legal system.  Compelling, since she is in a position, as a superior court judge, to inflict this amoral mentality and ideology upon the public through her legal rulings.      </p>

No way in hell should she even be given this consideration. <br>
This person has shown herself to be excessively arrogant (as so many are when given authority) and unfit for public service.</p>

			<p>Bobby is pretty correct. I am a state police officer and the court crowd (white and black Judges and support persons)actually believe they are exempt from all laws. Many of the law enforcement officers I work with have the same attitude (exempt), and the officers and Judges along with their support personnel DO NOT see eye to eye on anything. I have had to deal with many Judges who show total disrespect through out the entire traffic stop. One judge on more than one occasion has been caught with a tall-boy beer between his legs, speeding high rates of speed and operating DUI.  He is still sitting on the bench like a God, because they all are LITTLE GODS that answer to no one! They cancel out each others charges! I always tell everyone who asks, to vote NO on all incumbent judges during each election. And the way things are, that would not be a bad deal on any politician up for re-election!  I have had better luck dealing with black gang bangers than white politicians during the last 30 years. The bangers know the rules and know what will happen and they just try to get along good enough to continue on their way. The worthless arrogant Judges and politicians think that you need to kiss their butts and all but tell you so, plus they know how to play politics and make problems. Most brass in most departments are yellow and bend over backwards to kiss a judges or elected officials butt and will almost always side with the &#8220;complaining party&#8221; if they are a politician or judge.  Our system is designed to work when the majority of the population has integrity and ethics. However the truth is that the minority has those values thus the outcome is a failed system that appears to only be getting worse.</p>

			<p>Please go to the original article and watch the video.  It&rsquo;s mind-boggling that Officer Washington managed to keep his professionalism under that barrage.  He ought to be given an award for keeping his cool under fire.</p>
<p>As for the Judge, this is <i>at least</i> the 8th story I&rsquo;ve read recently of black female judges or city councilwomen acting like this!  I&rsquo;ve never heard of a black male judge losing it <i>this</i> badly while being arrested (and plenty have been arrested).  </p>
<p>Remember when Cynthia McKinney punched that Capital Police officer for asking to see ID?  Monica Conyers of the Detroit City Council is infamous for public temper tantrums, some of which are on youtube.  New Orleans&rsquo; Cynthia Hedge-Morrell has done it at least twice when pulled over for reckless driving.  New Orleans&rsquo; Veronica White did it recently when questioned about contradictory testimony.  </p>
<p>What is it about black women in power that causes such a high incidence of absurd, self-destructive temper tantrums?  It&rsquo;s not just the famous ones, either.  I once saw a black female property manager start screaming and throwing things in a homeowners association meeting.    </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to find the video of this disgraceful creature in action on the internet. Her kind have a way they act and react in society, it doesn&rsquo;t change with education or position, then they wondwer why people avoid them if they can, and it has nothing to do with color and everything to do with atitude and BEHAVIOUR.</p>

<p>&#8220;Race, Evolution &amp; Behavior&#8221; by J. Philippe Rushton explains it perfectly. To paraphrase our first black president, Bill Clinton, &#8220;It&rsquo;s the I.Q., stupid!&#8221; </p>
<p>P.S. Please see also &#8220;The Global Bell Curve&#8221; by Richard Lynn. It simply proves they be stupid all over da world.</p>

			<p>What made her angry was that the arresting officer was black. Blacks automatically expect favoritism from other blacks in positions of authority and she didn&rsquo;t get any.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because their &#8220;education&#8221; and &#8220;postions&#8221; are normally forged through the affirmative action process, which means they did not actually earn their credentials, nor do they merit them.</p>
<p>Sure, we can clean up an undesirable bum and dress him in a nice suit and tie. We can claim he has a college education and appoint him as the CEO of a large company. We may be able to pass him off as a legitimate, credible person for a short period of time with a lot of effort and care. We can print false documents with &#8220;official&#8221; seals that claim many positive things about him. We can send the bill for the whole charade to taxpayers. None of this changes who or what the bum really is.<br>

			<p>Affirmative action has cost this nation 1.1 trillion and this is what you get; educated (passable), credentials (by proxy), but no core values, no adherence to society (for a judge?), this woman stands as a shining example of that 1.1 trillion.  For what?</p>
