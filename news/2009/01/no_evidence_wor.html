<h1>No Evidence Workers Leaving U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Ferriss, Sacramento Bee, January 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Flor Gutierrez has a bird&rsquo;s eye view of how immigrants  &mdash;  37 percent of California&rsquo;s labor force  &mdash;  are reacting so far to a punishing recession.</p>
<p>She runs El Mercadito Latino in Elk Grove, where Mexicans and Central Americans shop and wire money to family back in their home countries. In December, she said, customers wired the same amount of money as they always have during a holiday month. But Gutierrez is bracing for a plunge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They definitely are buying less for themselves,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We may see people getting by with less here, so they can continue to help out those back home who are even worse off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutierrez&rsquo;s observations mirror what researchers at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, describe in a report issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigrants and the Current Economic Crisis&#8221; reviews statistical research and other information and concludes that there is no hard evidence of illegal or legal immigrants leaving in droves because jobs have dried up.</p>
<p>In addition to agriculture, immigrants are concentrated in construction, manufacturing and services, industries that have been battered by the downturn.</p>
<p>No doubt, tough times have already prompted some to leave U.S. soil and produced a &#8220;flattening&#8221; in the estimated number of illegal immigrants entering to seek jobs since 2007, said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, which studies U.S. and global migration trends and policies.</p>
<p>But home countries, especially those tightly linked to the U.S. economy, such as Mexico and those in Central America, are not hospitable places to search for work, either.</p>
<p>Drug trafficking violence and crime in Mexico are disincentives to returning, as is immigrants&rsquo; strong sense of responsibility to provide for family, the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers contend that U.S. policies encourage undocumented workers to remain in the United States and cling to whatever work they can find and wait out a downturn. In contrast, they say, the European Union&rsquo;s policy of free transit for EU citizens affords migrant workers &#8220;the ease of circulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spain, Papademetriou [Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute] said, is in a fix comparable to the United States. Africans and South Americans were drawn to work there, legally and illegally, when the economy was healthy.</p>
<p>Now, the immigrants don&rsquo;t want to leave because they don&rsquo;t have a guarantee they could ever return.</p>

								<h2>New Report: Legal, Illegal Immigration Flows React Differently to Recession; Return Migration, Though Probably Up, Is Not Yet a Definitive Trend</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON  &mdash;  With the United States in an economic crisis that may already be the worst since the Great Depression, a report issued today by the Migration Policy Institute finds that the recession may produce differing results for legal and illegal immigration flows.</p>
<p>The report, Immigrants and the Current Economic Crisis, cites a growing body of evidence suggesting there has been a measurable slowdown in the historic growth of immigration in the United States, largely because there has been no significant growth in the unauthorized immigrant population since 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legal and illegal immigration flows respond differently in an economic crisis,&#8221; said Migration Policy Institute President Demetrios Papademetriou, an author of the report. &#8220;Legal permanent immigration flows are the least responsive to economic pressures, while illegal immigration flows are the most responsive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, substantial return migration of unauthorized immigrants is unlikely unless there&rsquo;s a protracted and severe worsening of the U.S. economy,&#8221; Papademetriou added.</p>
<p>The report examines the effects of the economic crisis and factors such as immigration enforcement on the immigrant population already in the United States; predicts how future immigration flows may be affected; discusses how immigrants fare in the U.S. labor market during recessions; and offers possible policy prescriptions.</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s findings:</p>
<p>    * While there is anecdotal evidence that return migration to some countries, including Mexico, appears to have increased there is no definitive trend so far that can be tied in a significant way to U.S. economic conditions.</p>
<p>    * Suggestions that increasingly strict enforcement of immigration laws by federal, state and local officials is responsible for increased return migration appear to be premature. With enforcement differing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, selective enforcement strategies are likely to first divert unauthorized immigrants to other destinations within the United States where economic opportunities exist rather than induce them to leave the country.</p>
<p>    * Return migration appears to correlate more closely with economic, political and social developments in countries of origin than with economic conditions in the United States.</p>
<p>    * While immigrants on average share the demographic characteristics of the workers who are most vulnerable during recessions (including relative youth, lower levels of education and recent entry into the labor force), they also may be able to adjust more quickly than native-born workers to fluctuating labor market conditions because they are more amenable to moving and changing job sectors.</p>
<p>    * The lack of access to public benefits and family obligations (such as sending remittances to relatives in the country of origin) may force immigrant workers to go to extraordinary lengths to remain employed or find new employment quickly, possibly pushing some into dangerous working conditions or informal work.</p>
<p>    * Legal immigration appears least tied to U.S. economic conditions because most legal immigrants in recent years have been status adjusters who already live in the United States and tend to have strong labor market ties; there is a pent-up demand for employer-sponsored visas; about two-thirds of legal immigrants are coming to reunite with family on visas that, in many cases, took years to secure; and refugee and asylee flows are largely independent of the economic climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration is more responsive to economic downturns than legal immigration because it is comprised overwhelmingly of economic migrants whose decisions to migrate are based on their ability to find work,&#8221; said report co-author Aaron Terrazas, an MPI Research Assistant.</p>
<p>The report offers a number of policy suggestions that could make the U.S. immigration system more responsive to U.S. labor market and economic needs, among them the creation of a Standing Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets that would provide recommendations to Congress and the administration on adjustments to admissions levels based on labor market needs, employment patterns and changing economic and demographic trends.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the current economic crisis might not seem the most opportune moment to fix the chronic disconnect between the U.S. labor market and immigration system, visionary policymakers will recognize that a more nimble and thoughtful immigration system would better serve U.S. economic interests in an ever-more competitive global marketplace,&#8221; Papademetriou said.</p>
<p>The report, the first research product of MPI&rsquo;s new Labor Markets Initiative, is available online at: www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/lmi_recessionJan09.pdf</p>

			<p>I agree   &mdash;   the propaganda about &#8220;reverse migration&#8221; is just agitprop to keep whites discombobulated on the immigration issue.  The truth of the matter is that the migration into the U.S. is continuing.</p>

			<p>What this article completely misses is the fact that it actually costs a lot of money to live in the United States without a job. The same money savings the illegal aliens might burn through in a month or two, living in the US, would sustain the same family for a year or more in Mexico or Latin America.</p>
<p>Those with anchor babies (with US birth certificates) are not concerned about getting back into the country. They are guaranteed to be able to return if they left. Many of them leave for Mexico before Christmas and are gone for weeks or months.</p>
<p>What is keeping them HERE has nothing to do with economics, or jobs or money. They are staying there for the most part because Mr. Obama (like Bush before him) has promised them instant citizenship&hellip;..aka amnesty. And they certainly do not want to bolt as long as that is a short-term possibility. <br/>

			<p>Why would anyone leave this nation who has kids and other family, that are taken care of by a &#8220;gravy train of benefits&#8221; unavailable to them in say, Mexico. Who would do that? Until the abuse of the U.S.taxpayer stops and these benefits are all yanked away, these people from wherever they are from, aren&rsquo;t even considering leaving. They aren&rsquo;t stupid.</p>

			<p>  I never believed the story that they were leaving. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. They would always be better off in a sanctuary city then going back to Mexico.</p>

			<p>I never believed the reports from a couple of months back that stated illegals were leaving the US as the economy tanked, and wrote such here on this site. They will not start coming until we are allowed to kick them out. Which may happen as the economy tanks. The worst economic conditions in the US are better than the best days in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and so on. </p>

			<p>Without a doubt, there are still far more illegal Latinos here than the mainstream media or the Census Bureau believe. The folks at the Census do not have a great track record of estimating the illegal population   &mdash;   in 2000, they found six million more people here than they were expecting&hellip; all of whom, of course, were minorities; they got the estimate for the European (&#8220;non-Hispanic white&#8221;) population almost exactly right. Meanwhile, the Mexican census that same year found three million *fewer* people than expected. A real chin-scratcher, that one&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to make things even more obvious, El Salvador recently conducted a census. All estimates say the country has about seven million people, but they only were able to count 5,744,113. Salvadoran officials are flabbergasted, and are arguing with each other about it. They do not want to admit that well over a million more Salvadorans have headed to El Norte than they thought, and so are pinning the blame on inaccuracies in the voting rolls and so forth. Yeah, surrrre&hellip;</p>
<p>A great way to make an estimate of the illegal population is to look at births. Because of free medical care for illegals, the government *does* have a pretty good handle on the number of births to Latinos. Because of the large number of births and the laughably small tabulated illegal population, the TFR for Latinos now is almost 3.0 children per woman&hellip; absurdly high even for Latin America. (Mexico is down to 2.1 now.) If we assume a more realistic value of 2.5, then we can see that one-sixth of the Latinos in the United States are not believed to exist by the Census Bureau. The 2007 estimate gives 45.5 million Hispanics&hellip; the true value is likely more like 55 million.</p>
