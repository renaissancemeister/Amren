<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inequalities that begin at birth stack the deck against some of Jacksonville&rsquo;s children and worsen the problem of violent crime in the community, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The comprehensive study, authored by the Jacksonville Children&rsquo;s Commission and coupled with two other projects, has reignited the debate over the story of race in the city. And it presents dozens of statistics that paint a sobering picture of ongoing racial and ethnic disparities among children from birth to young adulthood. Among them:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  One in three black children live in poverty, compared with fewer than one in 10 white children.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  More than 13 percent of black infants are born with a low birth weight, compared with 7 percent of white babies.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Black students are suspended from school at a rate more than twice that of white students.</p>
<p>The statistics presented in the report were so stark that they stunned into silence a group of pediatricians at a meeting, said Anne Egan, the commission&rsquo;s chairwoman and a pediatrician herself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The findings illustrate why the city must get involved in the lives of at-risk children, Mayor John Peyton said at the report&rsquo;s release Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Peyton also touted the Jacksonville Journey, a $31 million anti-crime initiative that includes social programs, as an important commitment to children  &mdash;  although the Journey came under fire last year from critics who said it gave too much money to law enforcement at the expense of education.</p>
<p>The Journey is providing extra money to the Children&rsquo;s Commission for after-school programs and other initiatives to prevent children and teens from getting in trouble.</p>

			<p><i>Inequalities that begin at birth</i></p>
<p>Well, I would argue they actually began sometime around 20-30,000 years ago, but &#8220;at birth&#8221; is a good start. </p>
<p><i>The findings illustrate why the city must get involved in the lives of at-risk children, Mayor John Peyton said at the report&rsquo;s release Monday.</i></p>
<p>Any self-disrespecting socialist government would dearly love to &#8220;get involved in,&#8221; i.e. control, the upbringing of all children, not just the at-risk ones.  Alternatively, the state may simply expand the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; definition to cover all, or nearly all children.  If it weren&rsquo;t for state&rsquo;s rights amd home-schooling laws, we&rsquo;d practically be there already.<br>

			<p>&#8220; &mdash; One in three black children live in poverty, compared with fewer than one in 10 white children.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because blacks view education as &#8220;white&#8221; so they remain in poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220; &mdash; More than 13 percent of black infants are born with a low birth weight, compared with 7 percent of white babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because blacks view education as &#8220;white&#8221; so they never learn nor care to learn the importance of pre-natal care and a good diet.</p>
<p>&#8220; &mdash; Black students are suspended from school at a rate more than twice that of white students.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because black view education as &#8220;white&#8221; and do not see the need to act civilised in school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inequalities that begin at birth&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because black babies are born to black parents who did not care enough to invest in themselves and their children&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The statistics presented in the report were so stark that they stunned into silence a group of pediatricians at a meeting&#8221;</p>
<p>That is because if they had said what they learned about blacks through their pediatric practice they would have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The findings illustrate why the city must get involved in the lives of at-risk children&#8221;</p>
<p>That means they want our money and stuff.</p>
<p>In Charlotte NC a boy died from infections caused by a lack of dental care..the &#8220;family&#8221; raised a stink and wanted money for their suffering because they could not afford a dentist. Last time I checked toothpaste could be procured at most foodbanks or the dollar store. apparently it is the white man&rsquo;s job to brush black teeth. Oh yeah, her other son also had severe tooth decay..hmmm. If you can&rsquo;t afford toothpaste you can&rsquo;t afford kids. Wait, my bad, it&rsquo;s my fault.</p>

<p>Actually, doctors are pretty tough people and it is hard to &#8220;stun&#8221; them.  I think what this really means is:</p>

<p>Usurpation is the name of the game here. They take every opportunity to give themselves permission to expand their power over us.</p>
<p>Now they empower themselves in a mandate to impose equality among the children. This is just a few steps away from totalitarianism (which is the most mature form of socialism).</p>
<p>If things continue in that direction them we will <b>must</b> resort to this phrase of the Deaclaration of Independence:</p>

<p>Very true.  The plan is undoubtedly to grow government even further, increasing its power while providing more tax-funded, high-paying jobs to non-Whites and only non-Whites.<br>

<p>You are too funny!  Thanks for the laugh.</p>
<p>Some people will never accept responsibility for any negligence on their part, and they look upon the White race as a Santa Claus who OWES them every nice thing and good result in life because of the &#8220;legacy of slavery.&#8221;  </p>
<p>By the way, Blacks never want the legacy of slavery to end because it provides them a treasure chest of economic and social benefits.  Plus they get to self-righteously express their anger towards White people and be treated with kid gloves while doing so.  So would they want to quit dwelling on slavery and lose these perks?  This really is a racial scam and our White politicians in Washington are too naive to see this.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s true  &mdash;  Blacks are being used as the battering ram to break down the doors so that socialism can walk in.</p>
<p>Perhaps it already has walked in, long before Obama, and we did not even dare to name it, lest we be called &#8220;unChristian&#8221; or &#8220;hardhearted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are notorious for not caring for their kids. That does not mean I should be forced to care for them.</p>

			<p>44 years of &#8220;Great Society&#8221; spending and counting&hellip;spending our way to national bankruptcy while we &#8220;brown down&#8221; to a 3rd World nation. And to what end? The pursuit of egalitarian objectives that contravene the laws of Nature. We might as well be walking up a down escalator, while we live in a time &amp; place where an honest, open discussion of racial disparities is not even possible.</p>
<p>I throw in with the late Mr. Morrison: its time to &#8220;turn out the lights&#8221; (on 40+ years of failed policy) and begin again &hellip;else it will be &#8220;The End&#8221;, &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (gag) or no Messiah in the White House.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see, far more Black babies are born to single mothers with fathers that abandon and do not financially support them thus more Black children born to poverty stricken welfare mothers who have multiple kids with absentee fathers, far more Black mothers use drugs, drink or do not go to the doctor during pregnancy despite the fact that these Black women get their care free on medicaid, thus more lower birth weight babies born, far more Blacks act up in school than Whites, thus more suspensions. Any questions?</p>

			<p> &mdash; Black students are suspended from school at a rate more than twice that of white students.</p>
<p>Really? I believe black students probably commit deeds worthy of suspension a factor of at least eight times more often. Simply look at the young adult crime statistics broken down by ethnicity (Color of Crime). If blacks are 10 times more likely to commit murder than whites, and 40 times more likely to commit other violent offenses, why are they only being suspended at twice the rate in a public school setting. My suspicion is that a lot of the peer group violence   &mdash;   black-on-black or black-on-white   &mdash;   in public schools is ignored. Of course all white-on-black violence is by definition a hate crime where the FBI is required to haul the white perp away. Whereas, the school administration suspends a black kid only after he becomes obviously psychotic and threatens the life of a teacher or administrator. Then the kindly social worker hauls him away.</p>
<p>Other possibilities for why blacks get suspended from school only about twice as often as whites:</p>
<p>1) White kids are likely to get held by society to higher standards of behavior.<br>
2) They won&rsquo;t threaten to massacre the principal&rsquo;s family.<br>
3) White parents (notice the plural) might actually feel ashamed of their kids bad behavior, punishing and monitoring their child at home until he behaves better at school.<br>
4) White kids are in white majority (or plurality) schools where higher standards of discipline can be effectively enforced (see (1)). Low level violence is outlier behavior instead of the norm so its more likely to be punished with suspension.</p>

			<p>The way my 65 year old father talks,blacks were all right when he was growing up. They had kids named Billy,Ricky, Eddie and Johnny. They had respectable trades, worked hard, paid their taxes, raised and educated their kids, attended church regularly, had Nixon and Capehart(to non-Hoosiers, he was Indiana&rsquo;s senator through the 40s and 60s) bumper stickers on their Studebakers, and were likeable jolly people who didn&rsquo;t take themselves too seriously. I read of posters&rsquo; frustrations, many of which I&rsquo;ve experienced myself. After talking with my Dad, I feel a bit ashamed that maybe I&rsquo;m oversimplifying and overreacting. Pardon the rambling, I&rsquo;ll wrap it up with this, folks, WHAT WENT WRONG!?</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I&rsquo;ll wrap it up with this, folks, WHAT WENT WRONG!?</p>
<p>Maybe something we call &#8220;LIBERAL THINKING.&#8221; After the 1960s civil rights issues, it became instantly fashionable to blame Black failure, Blacks&rsquo; underachievement and criminal tendencies on slavery and post-slavery discrimination. Blacks suddenly were hired in droves&hellip; by high visibility corporations&hellip; who simply considered their salaries as another tax&hellip; that if the newly hired Blacks ACTUALLY performed useful work&hellip; that it was a bonus for the company.</p>
<p>Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon. Suddenly every movie had highly visible Black actors. Posing as the White leads&rsquo; best friends and closest confidantes. All-too-often, the script writers had the Blacks as being a smidgin brighter, smarter than the White Hero. TV Commercials (also a Hollywood product) followed suit. We saw White patients treated by all-knowing Black physicians. Black scientists and experts offering opinions on every conceivable subject. Black actors spouting all kinds of wisdom using words they probably couldn&rsquo;t personally understand.</p>
<p>Blacks were suddenly elevated. Meaning Black criminals were offered every conceivable excuse for their behavior guilt-ridden White fools and sociologists could dream up. Blacks were told to demand equality; while rejecting equal responsibility, equal accountability. </p>
<p>When the run-of-the-mill Black failed to emulate the now fashionable Hollywood stereotypes&hellip; NOT becoming doctors, scientists, brilliant thinkers&hellip; it was decided something was wrong. Integration by forced busing, integration by moving Blacks and Whites out of their neighborhoods, forcibly mixing the racial ratios of classes&hellip; also failed to solve the disparity problem. So our self-proclaimed government experts decided throwing MONEY at the problem would solve it. Accordingly, school and government payrolls were inflated by a host of administrators and managers, responsible for overseeing how this financial largesse would be spent.</p>
<p>Again, the predictable result. So once again, our experts decided the only answer being STILL MORE SPENDING! Now for the burning question: How many BILLIONS will it take&hellip; to boost the mental acuity and intellectual level of a ghetto kid to that of the average White kid&hellip; given the premise that the White kids generally have two parents raising them. Parents taking an interest in their schooling. Parents beggaring themselves to ready their children for and paying for their higher (post-public school) education? We&rsquo;ve already heard the Blacks&rsquo; demands&hellip; &#8220;LOWER THE BAR!&#8221; Why set grade and professional requirements so unrealistically high Blacks just can&rsquo;t hope to compete? Why indeed? Now WHO would want an affirmative action brain or heart surgeon operating them to save their life?</p>

<p> Your father would have been born in the early 1940&rsquo;s. His formative years and early adulthood would have been before the so-called &#8220;civil rights era&#8221;. This period changed everything. As Whites surrendered to the madness of liberalism and &#8220;White guilt&#8221; they basically stopped setting the trend and forcing blacks to follow suit. Witness the huge explosion in black crime, especially violent crime much of it racially based against Whites. Basically Whites stopped enforcing the rules against blacks (see the book VIGILANTE). Blacks were encouraged to nurture a sense of entitlement and a whole grievance culture developed. Whites became &#8220;pyhched out&#8221; by Hollywood and the media as they were now portrayed as &#8220;bad&#8221; and blacks as &#8220;good&#8221;. The &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; of blacks were now free to leave black neighbourhoods and settle in White ones. This badly hurt black communities and pushed them further along into ghetto status. The 1965 immigration act saw a flood of non-Whites enter the USA and they undercut blacks in jobs. For example Koreans basically pushed blacks out of the liquor store business in Los Angeles. I would also recommend Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s excellent book THE PATRIOT GAME (he operates out of VDARE.COM). Allthough the book is about Canada much of it applies to America. He writes about the &#8220;inherent pressures&#8221; that naturally exist in any Majority / Minority relationship. The majority must continue to set the tone and tell a minority group that at a given point their community must yield to the national interest or group. It takes nerve to do this but otherwise the relationship grows unstable and even violent. Throughout most of its history Canada presented itself to the world as an essentially English-speaking, Protestant, Anglophone nation in which their was one large province that functioned internally in French. Now Canada is a &#8220;bilingual&#8221; country and a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; state. Or as Brimelow notes &#8220;sometime this [20th] century English Canada lost its nerve&#8221;. Likewise America historically operated as a White country with a sizable black group in some parts. The USA lost its nerve too. This crisis of confidence occurred in the 1960&rsquo;s and in my opinion was largely attributable to the two &#8216;world wars&rsquo; which were really largely White European civil wars.</p>
