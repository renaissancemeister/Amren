<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-italian8-2009jan08,0,1495789.story">Advanced Placement Italian Exam to Be Suspended</a></h1>

<p>Despite a spirited fundraising campaign by Italian Americans in Southern California and across the country, the effort to save the AP exam in Italian has failed, at least for now.</p>
<p>The language exam for high school students trying to win college credit will be suspended after this spring&rsquo;s testing because not enough money was pledged to subsidize it, College Board officials in New York said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The exam was launched four years ago and is expected to attract only 2,200 test-takers this year, less than a quarter of the number needed to make it viable, they added.</p>
<p>The news disappointed Southland teachers of Italian. They said many students will be discouraged from studying the language without the prestigious AP Italian class and the incentive to earn college credit by passing the exam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nonprofit College Board, which offers 37 AP tests in various subjects, as well as the SAT, announced last spring that it would drop the Italian exam after 2009. Following protests by Italian Americans, the testing agency said it would reverse the decision if $1.5 million in outside money could be raised.</p>
<p>As a result, the Italian Language Foundation was formed and rounded up $650,000 in pledges from individuals, companies and philanthropies. But much of that was contingent on the Italian government funding most of the rest, according to foundation President Margaret Cuomo, a radiologist and the daughter of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Packer said that the numbers of students taking the annual Italian exam had edged up somewhat over four years but remained small compared with those for Spanish, with 101,000, and even Chinese, with 5,000, and were unlikely to reach the 10,000 originally projected by Italian test advocates. He said the College Board loses about $2 million a year on the Italian test after students pay the $86-per-test fee, and he emphasized that the organization&rsquo;s policy is not to spend more than $500,000 a year on an AP test.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the College Board, 305 high schools in the U.S. offer the Italian AP class, including about 23 in California. In contrast, more than 6,400 schools, including 1,120 in California, offer AP Spanish.<br>

			<p>This should not be chalked up as a conquest of the diversity of agenda.  Simply no one wanted to learn Italian.  It bled money so it was canceled.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s too bad, but I can&rsquo;t really see how this one can be blamed on the usual suspects, i.e. non-european immigrants and multicultaralists. Italian is not a popular language for students, period. I remember very few people taking it back when I was in high school in the eighties. This has nothing to do with any anti-European sentiment. French and German were and are still very popular. </p>

			<p>What do you expect?  It&rsquo;s not a third world language.  </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s because the politicians know that they can&rsquo;t create a whining, demanding, victim class out of the Italians. </p>

			<p>I wonder how long before advanced placement English is scuttled. At least I take some solace that when English is replaced by Spanish that it isn&rsquo;t something like Mandarin, and our communication continues to use a European language. I wonder how the the femanazis react to a language that stresses gender through items like &#8220;la&#8221; and &#8220;el&#8221;? They vote for diversity, and I hope they enjoy emphasizing gender through Espanol.</p>

			<p>  Surprisingly, mostly due to the sons and daughters of Italian Americans, Italian has made a huge comeback at my university. I&rsquo;m particularly happy with this trend because the life-affirming culture of Italy needs to be celebrated and preserved. I disagree with those &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; posters who say Africa starts at Rome. Some of the most racially conscious individuals I know are of Calabrian or Sicilian heritage. I say Africa starts at Washington, D.C.!</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll keep Chinese and Spanish because it&rsquo;ll be easier for immigrant Chinese and Latin American students to chalk up a &#8220;pass&#8221; on an AP exam. Period. </p>
