<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7849666.stm">Bolivians &#8216;Back New Constitution&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bolivians have backed a new constitution that aims to empower the country&rsquo;s indigenous majority, partial results from a referendum show.</p>
<p>With about 30% of the vote counted, some 53% of the voters supported the changes, electoral officials said.</p>
<p>But at least four of Bolivia&rsquo;s nine regions voted &#8220;No&#8221;.</p>
<p>President Evo Morales claimed victory in the referendum that would also allow Bolivia&rsquo;s first indigenous leader to stand for a second consecutive term.</p>
<p>Addressing supporters outside the presidential palace, he said the result marked the birth of a new Bolivia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brothers and sisters, the colonial state ends here,&#8221; President Morales, an Aymara Indian, told crowds in front of the presidential palace in La Paz after results emerged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Bolivia is being re-founded,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we begin to reach true equality for all Bolivians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Support for Mr Morales was highest in the western highlands where indigenous people form the majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new era is starting now in which indigenous people will be the citizens of this country. I think this is the most important part of this constitution,&#8221; said Elisa Canqui, who represents one of the Indian communities in La Paz.</p>
<p>Only some 50 years ago Indians of Aymara and Quechua descent were not allowed to walk in the central square of La Paz.</p>
<p>Now the new charter will give sweeping rights to Bolivia&rsquo;s 36 indigenous groups in the areas of government, the judiciary and land holdings.</p>
<p><b>Opponents</b></p>
<p>But the polarisation that has dogged the country since Mr Morales took office in 2006 is unlikely to diminish, says BBC Latin America analyst James Painter.</p>
<p>Many Bolivians of European or mixed-race descent in the fertile eastern lowlands, which hold rich gas deposits and are home to extensive farms, rejected the charter.</p>
<p>The referendum was badly defeated in the opposition strongholds of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni and Pando, early results suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;No&rsquo; vote has put the brakes on the fools who wanted to destroy our country,&#8221; said opposition leader and Santa Cruz Governor Ruben Costas.</p>
<p>The original draft of the constitution was more radical but Mr Morales made concessions after violent protests against his rule, including a promise that he would not try to win a third term in 2014.</p>
<p>Elections are set for December, when the president, vice-president and Congress will be chosen.</p>
<p>Under pressure from wealthy ranchers, who feared their farms would be broken up and handed over to the poor, Mr Morales also revised the charter so that limits on land holdings will only apply to future land sales.</p>
<p>The new constitution enshrines state control over key economic sectors, and grants greater autonomy not only for the nine departments but also for indigenous communities.</p>
<p>But these clauses regarding layers of autonomy could lead to a raft of competing claims, correspondents say.</p>
<p>The exact implementation of the new charter is also far from certain.</p>
<p>Several articles have to be approved in Congress where Mr Morales does not have a majority in the Senate.</p>
<p>Analysts say that another problem facing the Morales administration is that in the last three years it has benefited from the commodity boom but is now facing a major fall in the price of its main exports, minerals and gas.</p>
<p>Final results are expected in about 10 days.</p>
<p>SIDEBAR: Key Reforms</p>
<p>Re-election: Allows Mr Morales to stand for re-election in Dec 2009</p>
<p>Indigenous rights: Stresses importance of ethnicity in Bolivia&rsquo;s make-up. A whole chapter devoted to indigenous rights</p>
<p>Autonomy: Power decentralised, four levels of autonomy  &mdash;  departmental, regional, municipal and indigenous</p>
<p>Resources: Sets out state control over key economic sectors, state sovereignty over vast natural gas fields</p>
<p>Judiciary: Indigenous systems of justice same status as official existing system. Judges will be elected, and no longer appointed by Congress.</p>
<p>Land: New limit on ownership 5,000 hectares (12,355). But measure not retroactive.</p>

<p>Yeah, and this &#8220;new&#8221; Bolivia will be about half the size and have about 1/4 of the wealth of the old one once the eastern states finally say &#8220;enough is enough&#8221; and officially break off.  I would pay close attention to this story if I were you.  This could be the future of America playing out right before our eyes.</p>

			<p>The people who now are approaching the threshold of Bolivian rule are the same people that would sell their 14 year old daughters into marriage with their 18 year hold cousins for a truckload of beer and $16K in cash.    </p>

			<p>You know when will the anti-racist speak up for white people. Wether its in South Africa, Bolivia, Zimbabwe or here in America the so called anti-racist activist always seem to support the racist. I have not heard one anti-racist activist speak out against the white genocide in Zimbabwe or South Africa. I haven&rsquo;t heard them speak out against racist laws like affirmative action. </p>

			<p>I support President Morales and the new Bolivian Constitution.<br>
It not only recognizes the indigenous population (Indians) it promises health care and free education to all Bolivians. That is a worthy goal. We might want that in our country also.<br>
And if we, as White men and women, do not support self-determination for others, how can we honestly demand it for ourselves?<br>
Now, if Socialism is a poor model Morales&rsquo; plans may fall short and his country may suffer. But what the Bolivians decide to do is their business. <br>

What&rsquo;s the saying, democracy will only last until the populus realizes they can vote themselves money?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s akin to what we&rsquo;re seeing here. The indigenous people will vote to take what others have built before them. It&rsquo;s a short term strategy however. You can take what others have built but if you can&rsquo;t build it or maintain it yourself, it will eventually crumble.</p>
<p>The only question is how long will it take for Bolivia to return to pre-Colombian standards?</p>
<p>One generation or two?</p>

			<p>If you support self-determination, do you agree that Bolivia has the right to keep unwilling white citizens as part of their country, to be taxed and controlled into oblivion by a hostile majority?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Brothers and sisters, the colonial state ends here,&rdquo; </p>
<p>If Bolivians know anything of African history, those words are sure to send them doubling over in fear. </p>

			<p>The Indians are the majority, as they are in Paraguay and some of the other South American countries too.  They&rsquo;re not newcomers, they were there first.  Let them have their country, they really have been exploited for centuries.  Otherwise, drop the pretense of elections, openly declare the Indians a subject people, and make it stick.  I&rsquo;ve always felt that honesty is a White virtue.</p>

			<p>These Indians stopped evolving intellectually and socially eons ago and are therefore perfect candidates for communism.  Lets see how they like being enslaved by their own race by leaders evangelizing an alien political ideology&hellip;</p>

			<p>I agree with Anonymous.  We&rsquo;re hypocrites if we don&rsquo;t support this.  After all, they&rsquo;re just overthrowing their elites.  And the white elites of any country are not our friends either.<br>

			<p>I support the move to empower all genetically distinct peoples  &mdash;  including white people.  It&rsquo;s time to end the homogenization of nations, peoples and religions and have self  &mdash;  identification and self-determination for all genetically distinct peoples.</p>
<p>White lands for white people. Black lands for black people. Brown lands for brown people. Red lands for red people. Yellow lands for yellow people.</p>

<p>We in the U.S. already have FREE health care and education for the Bolivians!! and for everyone else born south of the U.S./Mexican border, all they have to do to get it is show up.</p>

<p>Free?  Then no taxes will have to be paid?</p>

			<p>Populist revolutions do one thing:</p>
<p>Redistribute wealth from the smarter to the dumber.</p>
<p>This is why all civilizations that have had them experience a downward spiral.</p>
<p>In the USA, it took a long time, but going from English-German to a mixed population has had some negative effects.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now the new charter will give sweeping rights to Bolivia&rsquo;s 36 indigenous groups in the areas of government, the judiciary and land holdings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which means that in about 10 years there will be new racial strife, as one or two of these tribes decide that while all Indians are equal, some Indians are more equal than others.</p>

			<p>Now that certain elements in Bolivia have discovered that they can vote themselves wealth that others have worked to create, watch the producers of that wealth find other nations to live in.  After they&rsquo;ve finished destroying Bolivia&rsquo;s economy, watch them demand to move to neighboring countries for &#8220;opportunity&#8221; that others are expected to create for them.  Isn&rsquo;t this what we have seen in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Free health care and education?  There&rsquo;s no such thing.  It&rsquo;s not even a &#8220;worthy goal&#8221;; it&rsquo;s just silly.  Where is the money going to come from?  Speaking personally, I work to support only myself and my own family.  As my life belongs to me alone, the hours of each day are my own as well.  I owe nobody outside my family any productive output.  Doubtless educated Bolivians feel the same way.</p>
