<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recently Nicolas Sarkozy announced plans to pursue a vigorous policy of diversity and m√©tissage. Concretely, this means giving preference to minorities in job hiring and prosecuting those who do not comply. In other words, affirmative action as a government policy from which none are exempt.</p>
<p>In his message Sarkozy insisted that the French people must change, that there will be dire consequences if they don&rsquo;t, and that not to intermarry racially is bad for the survival of the country. Thus he amalgamated the concepts of preference for minorities in job hiring with that of the need for the French to intermarry racially.</p>
<p>These are two separate things. But in the mind of Sarkozy they go together. Last December he chose a highly successful Algerian-born businessman, known as an impassioned advocate of diversity, Yazid Sabeg, to be his &#8220;high commissioner on diversity and equal opportunity&#8221;, and to implement these government orders.</p>
<p>It is well-known that in France ethnic statistics are forbidden by law, so in order to determine how many minorities are employed in any given enterprise, Sabeg will have to use all his resourcefulness, as this article from Le Figaro points out:<blockquote>Recently named commissioner on diversity and equal opportunity, Yazid Sabeg has political representation [i.e. the number of minorities in politics] as a priority. In a few days he will meet with parliamentarians and party leaders. He intends, he says, &#8220;to listen to what they propose to advance the cause of diversity and to break the glass ceiling.&#8221; But he already states that he will recommend &#8220;normative measures&#8221;. Otherwise, the agreements are worthless.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>&#8220;Normative&#8221; means that the measures adopted will all have to obey the same criteria.<blockquote>To advance the process, the commissioner will rely on a new study that determines the presence of minorities in political life. The Montaigne Institute, a think tank for entrepreneurs and businessmen, published an article on Wednesday tallying the ethnic composition of Parliament and the city councils of the ten largest cities in France, using an innovative method: photographs. Yazid Sabeg, a longtime pillar of the Institute, is enthusiastic for this method. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an interesting possibility to deal with the crucial issue of racial discrimination. I have myself advocated a family photo in the assessing of enterprises,&#8221; he explains. He had proposed that big companies provide such a photograph as a way of measuring visible minorities for purposes of promoting diversity.<br>
</blockquote>The article goes on to explain how a sociologist. Eric Keslassy, attempted to use photographs to determine the number of minorities in public office. He found in the National Assembly only three deputies belonging to minority groups, and in the Senate, four. Again using photos, he found that Paris had the highest rate of minority elected officials (17%), then Strasbourg (13.84%), Montpellier and Lille (11%), Toulouse (10%), Lyons (8%). Marseilles and Nice fared poorly, and Bordeaux had no minority elected official.<blockquote>Keslassy says that to renew the political class there are other, better, methods such as ending the practice known as &#8220;cumul&#8221; where one politician holds several posts, and introducing primary elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of that will take time,&#8221; Yazid Sabeg is quick to point out, &#8220;since minority candidates cannot aspire to a position without a public profile or a history of accomplishments.&#8221; The art of the new commissioner will be to navigate between the need to promote people up the social ladder and the uncomfortable fact of counting the numbers of minorities by their facial features.</p>
<p>Eric Besson, the new minister of immigration, who replaces Brice Hortefeux, claims to be skeptical over the use of photographs: &#8220;We must come up with trustworthy methods, in keeping with our traditions, without classifying people by race, ethnicity or religion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s rather complex.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not want to criticize those who are trying out new experiments, and I fully intend to work hand in hand with Yazid Sabeg.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they search for the perfect method to use for increasing the number of minorities, the system advocated by the High Council on Integration seems for now to be the most effective. Using family names and given names that were common in France at the end of the 19th century, and names that have recently appeared, a software program can determine persons of North African and sub-Saharan African origin, and persons from Europe, or even from overseas. This program showed that of the 35,000 elected officials in towns of more than 9000 inhabitants, 6.68% were minorities. A low figure but growing since 2001. While France is split from East to West, a reflection of the migratory waves.<br>
</blockquote>The High Council on Integration (HCI) dates back to 1989. It is a government agency, composed of 20 members, dedicated to the study of the integration of minorities.</p>
<p>As for the East-West split, this is news to me. Does it mean that Eastern France has more immigrants, or vice versa? Since Marseilles, Lyons and Strasbourg are in Eastern France, and Paris roughly in the center, it seems reasonable to assume that there are more immigrants in the Eastern half of the country, especially since that is where the borders with other countries lie.</p>
<p>English-language readers can review Sabeg&rsquo;s accomplishments in this article from January 2005 posted at Business Week. There is also some information at MLive. If you do a Google on him you will find numerous English-language references.</p>
<p>French readers can review his CV and get a closer look at his circle of friends in this article, also from January 2005, posted at L&rsquo;Expansion. For the record, this millionaire is said to be a bon vivant, warm, with a wide range of cultural and intellectual interests. He is married and the father of three, but I could not find information on his wife. I am almost certain I remember reading that she is of Danish-French origin, but after a time-consuming search I could not find proof of that assertion.</p>
<p>Finally, one of his goals is to introduce diversity as early as possible in the schools:<blockquote>&#8220;It should be an objective of the national education system. ( &hellip; ) You cannot create diversity in schools unless you change the school districting so that the high-schools in the downtown areas can accept students from the disadvantaged middle schools of the ghettoes, without ethnic quotas. ( &hellip; ) As for myself, I feel French and republican, and also Arab-Berber. I speak Arabic, and I am a Muslim. I repeat, I am a Frenchman and in no case will I renounce one single element of my identity.&#8221;</blockquote><br>

			<p>For those of you who understand French, here is the entire speech Nicolas Sarkozy made regarding &#8220;the challenge of <i>metissage</i>.&#8221;  &#8220;Metissager&#8221; is French for &#8220;miscgenation&#8221; or &#8220;crossbreeding.&#8221;  He is literally telling the French people that they have an <i>obligation</i> to be less French:</p>

			<p>You would think he would be preaching proceation instead of diluting culture (not only the French culture).  This guy was a scab from the getgo but the French ignored LePen and now they will suffer the consequences.  Ditto with the British and Enoch Powell.  Self preservation took a backseat to pleasure and now our beloved race is at a tipping point.  G-d bless the Russians (I never thought I&rsquo;d be saying that!)!<br>

			<p>Has Nicolas Sarkozy been tested for schizophrenia or some form of dissociative identity disorder? One moment, the man is &#8220;fire and brimstone&#8221; against immigrants, and the next, he is pro-miscgenation. I think he is nut case of some kind. </p>
<p>His best course of action is to move to Arabia or Africa and become a Muslim.<br>

			<p>Where the hell does Sarkozy get off consigning the French to the dustbin of history? The French elected him and he repays them by locking them out of jobs and turning over their country and even their sons and daughters to the invaders. Like I said, there is some sinister force at work attacking the white western nations of the world and one of its agents has just been unmasked.</p>

Just like G W Bush, Sarkozy seems to have been elected on one platform (a crackdown on immigration and refugees) but when in office, goes in a completely different direction.</p>
<p>Would Sarkozy have been elected if the told people he was going to force &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; on business and his own people? Would Bush have been elected had he make his famous &#8216;family values don&rsquo;t stop and the Rio Grande&rsquo; speech before he was elected?</p>
<p>How do we explain this?</p>

			<p>I wrote in a previous posting on this forum a few days back concerning Sarkozy&rsquo;s belief that Islam is the language of science and the future,etc., that I could not understand why the French cannot see that Sarkozy is both anti-French and anti-Western. It is so obvious in everything the man does and says. Now this story comes out. How ignorant, and or apathetic, have the French become? What if he next puts on a clown suit and on national television starts to make faces and fun of France and Frenchmen/women? Would there still be blank stares and non-reactions in France? It&rsquo;s unreal what goes on in western nations nowadays. People are in a kind of mass hypnotic trance or something. Can any of the people adept at psychiatry on this forum explain it?</p>

When a politician claims &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; who he is really talking too are other politicians. The more diverse a nation is the easier to be able to dictate how people should behave. I am sure the recent riots in france  by muslims and non-whites were manna from heaven for Sarkozy. I am sure no one in france blamed the non-whites for the carnage.It was of course the fault of native white frenchmen.</p>

			<p>The French have to intermarry for the &#8220;survival&#8221; of France? Is Sarkozy insane? No, Mr. Sarkozy, ship out the immigrants! Then France will survive.  The French need to wake up pronto and ship Sarkozy out also. What gives that guy the right to Tell the French to give away their genes and dilute themselves fo nothing? Another blatant in your face LIE! How much more are Whites going to take this? It is out in the open now. </p>

			<p>Sarkozy is not ethnically French, not that it would make a difference.  Looking at him, I would bet he has some Algerian/Sephardic blood in him which is why he might be pushing the miscegenation thing.<br>

			<p>The funny thing is that Sarkozy is not even French! As far as we know, he doesn&rsquo;t have a drop of French blood, and yet is half-Turk. </p>
<p>He is genetically alien to the French, and has most certainly betrayed them. Now, the French have no moral obligation to this genetic foreigner betraying their interests.</p>
<p><br>
On another note, I am part French, though not pure French. And yet, if I were the French Prime Minister, even I would want to keep France genetically French.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also prosecuting a liberal 80 year old cartoonist who mocked Sarko&rsquo;s son for marrying a wealthy Jewish heiress. So much for free speech.</p>

			<p>Hopefully Sarkozy will get enough coverage by conservative and moderate news outlets to scare white Americans. Some here may disagree, but things like this make many people tense. It just looks too much like a full fledged, intentional displacement of white people. </p>
<p>And Obscuratus is absolutely correct. Western Europeans, especially the French and the Scandinavians, are just too far gone. Large incentives for mixed race kids is just around the corner. Bet money on it. </p>

			<p>This guy has the backbone of an amoeba. This is horrific logic, that by losing your racial identity you will preserve the culture it created. On top of this he&rsquo;s just about enforcing breeding programs that are on the arranged marriage concept to encourage the demise of the native people. This tolerance of diversity is seen more and more clearly as a movement to DESTROY diversity by destroying millenia old racial types in their native lands. This is marxism at a genetic level,.. as I&rsquo;ve pointed out several times. How would this process make for a better world? I think its quite clear that jealousy and envy are the motive forces in trying to coerce successful groups out of their genetic wealth. Dark people want white genetics and tolerance of diversity or multi-cult is their Trojan horse.</p>

			<p>Not too long ago Sarkozy appeared to be one of the more rational and realistic politicians on the European scene.  Now he is drunk with the same multi-cultural insanity that affects so many leaders in the western world.</p>
<p>If this bizarre change in position was just an isolated incident among the western world&rsquo;s leaders then it could attributed to chance.  However, it occurs again, and again, and again.  These now almost common positions used to be relegated to the radical left-wing fringe groups just ten plus years ago.  Now they are mainstream positions at certain levels of governance.</p>
<p>So what persons or organizations are illicitly influencing our leaders???  What do they hope to gain???  Who would have such power???  And how did it get to be so pervasive????<br>

<p>for a country with so much history and culture to go in the direction suggested by Sarkozy is bizarre and suicidal, leave it to france to surrender at the first wiff gunpowder. Why are there so many whites bent on the elimination of their race? Just what do they think things will be like for the Human Race if the white race is absorbed? here&rsquo;s a hint, your &#8220;descendants&#8221; will either be Hutus  or tutsis, because at only about 10% of the worlds population, it will only be averaging down.</p>

			<p>Agree with sbuffalonative.  Thre real problem was created by governments.  They did not limit immigrations into their countries. Rapid reproduction of immigrants is the norm.  Now,the failures of government policies are forced upon its natural citizens race, culture and civic order.  It is a betrayed sorry state when leaders blame and deny citizenry of their own country/language/culture/race; then force them to integrate.  This is a new form of treason. V</p>

			<p>Sarkozy, like most White Europeans, are terrified of their Arab immigrants, and are trying their hardest to appease them into being docile, law-abiding citizens. However, as has been true throughout history, appeasement does not work, and in doing so, they are only surrendering their cultural, ethnic, and historical heritage to a foreign civilization that wishes to destroy them, and replace the French Tricolour and Union Jack with the Islamic Crescent. If the French people do not wake up, and soon, it will be demographically too late for them. </p>

<p>   Yes, the &#8220;great liberal dream&#8221; of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. It has never worked (check out Brazil, India, and Egypt) and never will work. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the immigrants assimilate rather than the indigenous population? Sarko wants the French to be a brown race of Muslims. He envisions a Third World future for France. Do the French people want his future?</p>

			<p>Sarkozy&rsquo;s urging Whites to interbred with non-White immigrants remind me of a Sam Clemments (more popularly known as Mark Twain) comment: &#8220;If you could breed a human being with a cat, it would improve the quality of humans, but lessen the quality in cats.&#8221; Now substitute White humans with the term cats in that quote&hellip; you get the idea! The mongrelized race would have to be of lesser quality than their ancestors.</p>
<p>I have always maintained the Indians (Incas, Mayans, Aztecs), despite their revolting bloodthirsty religious beliefs were fairly advanced in many respects. Spaniards invading and conquering the new territories, of course White Europeans. Yet today&rsquo;s mestizos are far inferior to BOTH sets of ancestors. So it&rsquo;s safe to assume were Sarkozy&rsquo;s wish to come true, massive interbreeding by White French with African immigrants, the quality of people thus produced would drop precipitously.</p>
<p>It might be pointed out those Central American Indians had an excellent knowledge of masonry, astronomy. They developed an accurate calendar, were able to predict eclipses and had many other skills and knowledge. Thus being thousands of years ahead of Africans of that same time period. </p>

			<p>I can understand liberal thinking on miscegenation&hellip; by inducing Whites to betray their own interests and breeding with non-Whites, until all all Whites have beeen absorbed into a now more-or-less brown race&hellip; but WHAT WOULD THE GOOD BE? While the aim of liberals might be to (hopefully) end inter-racial friction and racial animosity&hellip; would it? Could it, really end?</p>
<p>Even in Blacks, light-skinned Blacks are regarded higher than the pure Blacks. Even in our Latin-American countries, while racism is claimed to be &#8220;non-existent&#8221;, the opposite holds true. Light-skinned (predominantly European White descended) people looking down on their darker compatriots.</p>
<p>If by assimilation (mis-cegenation) you dilute the White race to become non-existent as a separate race, you nevertheless LOSE the ingeniuity, drive, vision, and thinking that enabled Whites to build today&rsquo;s civilization along with its mani-fold benefits. By interbreeding, Whites being LOWERED mentally to be no better than the rest of that now-brown sea of humanity. Reverse-evolution kicking in. It would take only a century or two for a wholly-brown human race to retrogress many hundreds of years respective to knowledge, quality of life, etc.</p>

<p>This is the first time we have seen this  topic openly addressed by a government leader.  Take note.   It&rsquo;s a historical milestone.   Formerly, until now, the authorities (in France and everywhere) have talked about promoting equality, have condemned discrimination and racism, have stressed the need for affirmative action in jobs and scholarships.  But until now, they have been extremely reluctant to bring up the very  touchy subject of inter-marriage. Government has traditionally avoided getting involved in families, which is a hot potato issue (but one which Marxists would dream about).  Sarkozy has now broached the unmentionable.   </p>
<p>I and some others here have been predicting this would eventually happen   &mdash;  -  in a number of years there would be housing subsidies, job preferences etc. favoring inter-racial families over mono-racial ones. Perhaps tax benefits, and who knows what other forms of official favoritism.  </p>
<p>Sounds crazy?  Unbelievable?   Well, all of the programs  that we have  now would have sounded crazy just 30 or 40 years ago.  Now, they&rsquo;re reality. The public adjusts to anything, given time.</p>

			<p>Sarkozy is forcing the crisis of Western genocide to the center of issues - at least in France.  He is making the choice plain, support for him and his government means support for the extinction of the French language, French culture, and French genetics as indigenously European.  He may be doing the real French a favor as well as the rest of us by actually making clear the intentions of his government (and therefore other similar politicians that identify with his ideas).  If the French literally lay down for this, then they are choosing extinction.  The hope of course, is that this trend will spread beyond France and England and turn Europe into an Islamic, Marxist entity.  It will be interesting to see how the Vatican responds to this growing pressure as well.</p>

			<p>Skipper: &#8220;So what persons or organizations are illicitly influencing our leaders??? What do they hope to gain??? Who would have such power??? And how did it get to be so pervasive???&#8221;</p>
<p>One such organisation is Common Purpose (note the initial letters). Founded in Britain in the mid-1980s (but now active in several other countries), ostensibly as an &#8220;educational charity&#8221;, this organisation headhunts up-and-coming individuals in a variety of businesses and institutions (including local government, education, the mass media, the police force and the legal profession). It attempts to brainwash them on &#8220;training courses&#8221;, and (should they prove pliable subjects) plants them back in their businesses or institutions, on the understanding that their first loyalty is to Common Purpose. </p>
<p>Common Purpose is rabidly pro-EU, pro-immigration and pro-&#8220;diversity&#8221;. The BNP have been sounding alarm bells about this sinister organisation for some time, and there are a series of videos on YouTube by a man called Brian Gerrish, an ex-Naval officer (who is more than a little odd and creepy himself, as it happens), exposing its infiltration at all levels.</p>
<p>Common Purpose is closely affiliated to other powerful but little-known bodies in the UK, such as the Evelyn Oldfield Unit (a pro-refugee organisation that receives funding from a variety of sources, including the Home Office and the National Lottery). The late Sir Bernard Crick, a government adviser responsible for drawing up the &#8220;citizenship&#8221; syllabus in British schools, was a keynote speaker at the tenth annual conference of the EOU.</p>
<p>This is how it gets to be &#8220;so pervasive&#8221;! </p>

<p>I have come across this view before.  The irony which such people somehow completely miss is that, by creating a uniform mixed brown race, you end up actually removing diversity.  But that&rsquo;s not the real goal; it&rsquo;s all about eliminating one&rsquo;s own white race.  It&rsquo;s insanity.  Non-whites demand racial solidarity, and liberal whites reject it.</p>

			<p>Sarkozy said in his speech, &#8220;Moreover, it is consanguinity that has always provoked the end of civilizations and societies.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an important statement!  Many social scientists have believed this especially since the end of World War II.  They think that if formerly white nations are engineered to be a multitude of low I.Q. races and non-assimilable cultures, whites will lose their patriotism and be less likely to fight.  </p>
<p>If a country&rsquo;s population is not related by a common culture or race or religion, it is theoretically less likely to fight over offenses to its ethnic pride.  For example, if the Hindus in America want our country to go to war with Pakistan, won&rsquo;t the Pakistanis in America try to prevent that?  Or if the Haitians in our country want us to go to war with, for example, Cuba, won&rsquo;t the Cubans in America try to prevent that?  Theoretically, then, no wars will fought, unlike if we were one monolithic ethnic group of people.</p>
<p>However, the social engineers have missed something:  Besides ethnic pride and self-interest, there are other reasons countries can go to war, such as wanting more land for a ballooning population, or to gain scarce resources like water, food, minerals or oil, etc., or even for political ideology.</p>
<p>I think many people are afraid of white militaries and that is one of the main reasons they want to eliminate us or neutralize our political power.</p>
