			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Littlejohn, Daily Mail, January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When I asked Trevor Phillips why he&rsquo;d turned his back on a successful career in television and taken his last job as head of the race relations commission, he replied: &#8216;Because I can say things <i>you</i> can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s ever stopped me, but I took his point. As a black man on the inside track, he could tell the truth without being accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;. And he&rsquo;s been as good as his word.</p>
<p>In one of his first pronouncements, he attacked the &#8216;gold chains and no brains&rsquo; culture which leads to young black men in Britain apeing nihilistic American rappers and ensures they become trapped in a ghetto of their own creation. That kind of statement of the obvious from a white man would have been howled down.</p>
<p>Now, as chairman of the new all-singing, all-dancing Equalities Commission, he has gone further, endorsing what this column has been arguing for years and shattering one of the Left&rsquo;s great articles of faith.</p>
<p>In a thoughtful, courageous article for the Daily Mail, timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the official inquiry report into the genuinely racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, he declares that Britain is the least racist country in Europe.</p>
<p>He also says that the label of &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; which has hung over the police like a &#8216;badge of shame&rsquo; ever since is no longer valid and we need a new vocabulary.</p>
<p>Those of us who argued at the time that it was ludicrous to accuse the entire police force of racism, over what was a bungled murder inquiry, were ourselves slandered as &#8216;racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The phrase was seized upon by those Trevor identifies as &rsquo; guilt-tripping white folks&rsquo; as a potent stick to batter every public institution in the country.</p>
<p>They have used the catch-all cliche; of &#8216;racism&rsquo; to advance their own agenda, silence dissent and bully the paying public into submission.</p>
<p>Until recently, anyone who questioned whether mass immigration was either desirable or sustainable was vilified. The blameless, courteous chairman of Migrationwatch  &mdash;  who exposed the reality behind the Government&rsquo;s fiction over immigration  &mdash;  was subjected to a vicious campaign of character assassination.</p>
<p>Fear of being accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; has paralysed the police force. It has been exploited by cynical chancers such as Ali Desai and Tarique Ghaffur to enhance their promotion chances and shake the money tree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached an absurd impasse in which police are prevented from objecting to the siting of a gypsy camp on the grounds that to do so would be &#8216;racist&rsquo;  &mdash;  despite compelling evidence that it would lead to a rise in crime, which is what the Old Bill are supposed to be in business to prevent.</p>
<p>In local government, it has led directly to the tragic murder of Victoria Climbie, who was tortured to death while Haringey social services stood back because &#8216;chastisement&rsquo; was considered to be part of her African &#8216;culture&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Fear of being accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; stalks the corridors of our Town Halls and government departments, creating a generation of box-ticking, brain-dead bureaucrats. Zey are only obeying orderz.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;d take issue with Trevor is over the description &rsquo; guilt-tripping white folks&rsquo;. While it is true most of the phoney allegations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; come from humourless, middle-class, white Guardianistas, they&rsquo;re not on a guilt-trip.</p>
<p>As far as they are concerned, they are good people. And the way in which they reinforce their own self-righteousness is via a constant crusade to make the rest of us feel guilty.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve pulled the same trick with &#8216;homophobia&rsquo;, hysterically accusing of hating gays anyone who has reservations about same-sex couples adopting children, or who objects to men having sex with each other in public parks and toilets.</p>
<p>In truth, most of the hatred comes from the Left, who enforce the cult of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; with Stalinist zeal, deliberately destroying the careers and reputations of decent people who dare to disagree with them. Being wrongly accused of racism is as hateful as racism itself.</p>
<p>They always deny it, but it is the Left who drive people in desperation into the arms of the BNP. And as Trevor Phillips rightly acknowledges, inequality today is more economic than racial, with poor whites as much victims as those from ethnic minorities. Yet disadvantaged whites feel there is no one to speak up for them. That&rsquo;s why some turn to extremists.</p>
<p>I first realised Trevor was riling the Guardianistas when the odious Ken Livingstone accused him of sucking up to the BNP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to think of a more vile slur to level at a black man. But that is the level to which these hate-mongers are prepared to descend.</p>
<p>Of course, racism hasn&rsquo;t gone away. I doubt it ever will. But things have improved immensely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve described before walking through London Weekend Television with Trevor in the mid-1990s, when it dawned on me that his was the only black face which wasn&rsquo;t pushing a broom or working in the canteen.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be complacent, but things have progressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why older folk, who grew up in a monochrome Britain, have trouble coming to terms with a multi-racial society. But to my children&rsquo;s generation, race isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>The growing number of mixed-race children, the Lewis Hamiltons and Leona Lewises, are evidence of that. Beige is the new black and white.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long argued that left to their own devices, people rub along quite well together. The indigenous British have been far more accepting of incomers than any other nation in Europe  &mdash;  and far more scandalously traduced by their own political leaders.</p>
<p>Trevor and I would probably part company on this, but I&rsquo;ve always considered the race relations industry to be as much part of the problem as the solution.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day he announces that his own commission is being wound up.</p>
<p>Until then, Trev, keep telling it like it is.<br>

			<p>So white people need black people now to tell them the facts about racial matters?  <p>There is no such thing as &#8220;diversity&#8221; when it comes to the truth, and I am getting tired of this notion that only spokesmen designated due to their race, sex, etc. are capable of pronouncing the truth on discrete subjects like race for the rest of us.</p></p>

Trevor Phillips knows he holds the power and he relishes it. Like the monarchs of old, he can have people done away with one word.</p>
<p>We can only hope that one day he goes too far and either picks on an innocent man or picks a fight with the wrong man willing to fight back.</p>
<p>How these people gain these positions of power is beyond understanding.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The growing number of mixed-race children&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Leftists have fetishized white guilt, but it&rsquo;s rightists who have internalized it. </p>
<p>I think conservative &#8220;colorblindness&#8221; is a far more sophisticated form of white guilt than the old liberal form of explicit moral strategizing.</p>

			<p>Such a strange feeling to see one of the family names writing for the Daily Mail&hellip;.I suppose he and I could be distant cousins. (My great grandfather married a Littlejohn. Her family came from Fairfax County, Virginia, where they owned slaves. And when one of the family bought a plantation in South Carolina, they owned slaves too. And when some of this family moved west on the Tennessee River, they had a daughter that married my great grandfather.) I wonder what Richard Littlejohn would say about his own family owning black slaves?</p>
<p>Still&hellip;the unmistakable message we get from the article is not that Trevor Phillips is somehow even-handed on the race issue. The message is that &#8220;racism&#8221; is automatically wrong, bad and unacceptable behavior. I do not believe this is true. Nor do I believe it is true that in the future (however distant) everyone will be beige-colored and race will be nothing more than a nasty footnote in the history books.</p>
<p>What Richard Littlejohn assumes is &#8220;racism&#8221; is probably no more than &#8220;race realism&#8221;. Far from being a mindless bigotry, race realism is based on information that is true and can be demonstrated. Instead of calling every distinction of race a matter of racism, he should first inquire whether the distinction is a true fact. If it is true, then it cannot be &#8220;racism&#8221;&hellip;.it is an accurate description of the race in question.</p>

			<p>The one key sentence in this article is:</p>
<p>&#8220;They always deny it, but it is the Left who drive people in desperation into the arms of the BNP.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Comrades Littlejohn and Phillips are starting to grasp (most likely, in that oddly come-lately and self-centered hyper-survival instinct of blacks)is that the party will soon be over for them, thanks to the white Marxist loons they owe so much to. Had Britain been a bit more selective from about 1946 onwards and a bit less &#8220;accepting of incomers&#8221; even to this day, the author might not even be in the UK, nor Comrade Phillips for that matter? </p>
<p>And that is the true crux of this matter, not just for the UK, but the entire white world. We owe these people nothing; we need be concerned even less of their &#8220;opinions&#8221; and &#8220;sensibilities;&#8221; and when things change, simply because they are more &#8220;reasonable&#8221; today then they were yesterday, it is not reason enough for a pass to be given to them.</p>
<p>When the BNP comes to power in Britain, may God grant them the wisdom never to forget that!<br>

			<p>It seems that there is an inverse relationship between the amount of guilt felt and the time of the crime committed. At this rate, in a hundred years we will be flagellating our own backs over slavery.</p>
<p>Check the article entitled &#8220;Guilt and Pride&#8221; at Cordelia: <a href="https://cordeliaforlear.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://cordeliaforlear.blogspot.com/</a> I think they pretty much hit the nail on the head on this subject.</p>

			<p>Forget the War on Drugs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the War on Sanctimoniousness.<br>
Or, Self-Righteousness, whatever you prefer.<br>
I have long been convinced that it is by far the worst addiction in the world.  Also, I will say this, Self-Righteousness is mostly found in Cultures that are both highly verbal, and highly moral.  That is to say, where morality runs as a high priority.  <br>
Sanctimoniousness is a feature of Higher Cultures.  You could say it is one of the pitfalls, or danger spots, and it is clear that as the Higher Culture of the West has descended it has in direct proportion to its surrender to self-righteousness. <br>
We have been through this before, but never to this magnitude.  <br>
I personally think that the addiction to mood-altering through self-righteousness is the very virus that is eating away at the West, perhaps irrevocably.  It isn&rsquo;t &#8220;like&#8221; a progressive disease, it IS a progressive disease.<br>
So then, what we need is a World-Wide Intervention.  But, to take part in that you would have to know what you are talking about. And I personally think (and I realize that a good many people would quarrel with this) that this automatically disqualifies anyone who identifies themselves with the Left OR the Right.  Maybe the whole Left and Right thing among Whites is the very source of the problem, the very source of the verbal cancer eathing away at the Psyche and Spirit of Modern Man.  It very well may be.  <br>
In that case, we should remove it with as much skill, and as much mercy, as a Doctor shows while removing a cancerous tumor from a still living human body.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think many white nationalists understand that blacks are not the enemy. <br>
Blacks are just pawns in the game . It&rsquo;s the liberal establishment that needs to be taken down.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism will/does not benefit blacks . Blacks would gain just as much as whites if they could cast off these marxists and get down to the business of solving social problems in a community that is made up of their racial kin.</p>
<p>White nationalists should make allies of blacks who are smart enough to know they are just being used.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t follow British events much, but I get the sense that Trevor Phillips fears that his multiculturalist buddies have been moving too fast, and that it&rsquo;s time for a period of consolidation.  Play the moderate, calm the masses, and let them get used to the Blacks and Moslems they already have.  In a decade or so, more old Whites will have died, more non-White babies will have been born, more Whites will have accepted the anti-racist orthodoxy, and the English will be a minority.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;What Richard Littlejohn assumes is &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is probably no more than &ldquo;race realism&rdquo;. </p>
<p>I would go farther than that. What Richards assumes is racism, and what is commonly held up as an example of racism, is probably just a reaction against racism. Much the way white-flight and anti-immigration is painted as racism when it is really a matter of being exposed to the racism of non-whites, and not wanting to experience more.</p>
<p>When the reporter, Richard Littlejohn, says, &#8220;racism hasn&rsquo;t gone away&hellip; But things have improved immensely&#8221; He&rsquo;s certainly speaking for himself and not any whites I know.  </p>

			<p>I note that Mr Littlejohn had inserted a few platitudes into his article in order not to offend, namely:<br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to understand why older folk, who grew up in a monochrome Britain, have trouble coming to terms with a multi-racial society. But to my children&rsquo;s generation, race isn&rsquo;t an issue&#8221;, and,<br>
&#8220;The growing number of mixed-race children, the Lewis Hamiltons and Leona Lewises, are evidence of that. Beige is the new black and white.&#8221;<br>
The fact that Lewis Hamilton has done nothing apart from drive a car around in circles earned a fortune and moved his wealth off-shore and&hellip;. Leona who? <br>
Like America&rsquo;s Messiah, Obama (I&rsquo;ll get round to doing something you wait and see), Lewis &amp; Hamilton have yet to contribute anything tangible to UK society and this is air-brushed over by Littlejohn. <br>
(It should also noted that beige is widely acknowledged as being a bland, non-colour used by estate agents to sell a house to gullible punters.).<br>
It appears that Littlejohn, like many social commentators before him, has placed his teeth in a bedside glass of water in order to get published by an increasingly race-ophobic British press. </p>

			<p> The only way the have power over Whites with the<br>
White guilt trip is if Whites believe it. This is<br>
brainwashing 101. Convince someone that they are<br>
defective, and you can control them. That is why<br>
after 12 - 16 years of public schooling and <br>
college brainwashing. Many Whites have been <br>
brainwashed to think that Whiteness has an evil<br>
defect. And that the only way to atone is throug<br>
racial and cultural suicide. Of course no matter<br>
what Whites do, it will never be enough. Marxists<br>
and race hustlers will never relinquish their<br>
power and control voluntarily. They only way to <br>
break free, is to break free of the <br>
brainwashing. And when the White race does this <br>
universally, the jig is up.</p>

			<p>Richard Littlejohn is one of these &#8216;pressure valve&rsquo; types like Michael Savage. They are no friend of European Caucasians.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to understand why older folk, who grew up in a monochrome Britain, have trouble coming to terms with a multi-racial society. But to my children&rsquo;s generation, race isn&rsquo;t an issue.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes Richard, race must never be an &#8216;issue&rsquo; must it?</p>
<p>And as the gene-pool of Britain becomes browner every day, so the mean IQ level drops and the once mighty island slips into third world status. Haiti here we come.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White guilt&#8221; is a complex mix of feelings that more closely resemble &#8220;white embarrassment&#8221; when a white politician or historical figure is reported as doing something that is now embarrassing or has become embarrassing at these times.</p>
<p>&#8220;White embarrassment&#8221; is just an unconscious appearance of white identity, generated by a verbal or written assault. Most white people don&rsquo;t realize it, but there are very strong bonds that link them with each other, but which are difficult to speak aloud.</p>
<p>But there will be a very different response, for example, by white people when Obama makes a stupid mistake compared with how we would feel were it to have been McCain who made the same stupid mistake.</p>
<p>So, to the extent we can feel shame or embarrassment when white leaders act stupidly, and not at all when Mexican, Haitian, Japanese, or American Indian tribal leaders act stupidly, we do exhibit a bond which represents shared demographic feelings that have been very difficult to speak about before Obama.</p>

<p>What utter arrogance! What absurdity! What perversion! Mixed-race children are the ideal?!!  This is tuly evil. The turning of right and wrong - upside down and inside out. For any white to accept this is disgraceful, and a society that accepts this is terminally ill. It is normal and natural and right to prefer one&rsquo;s own race, and if one is white then of course one should view the white race in everyway - physically, aesthetically, culturally - as superior. Even nonwhites do. Only a depraved indoctinated white would even for a moment think of miscegenating with a non-white!!!</p>
<p>As for Littlejohn - what a nicompoop, as all the so-called conservatives in Britain are.  Too damned scared to fight for the preservation to the white British people.  Forward the BNP.</p>

			<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t &#8220;white guilt&#8221; so much as &#8220;white sanctimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you think the archetypal &#8220;Church Lady&#8221; sitting on the front pew, all dolled up in her &#8220;Sunday-Go-To-Meeting&#8221; clothes feels any guilt?  Do you think she sits there and trembles with fear as the preacher fulminates about &#8220;sinners going to hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not.  She&rsquo;s sitting there all prim and proper and silently wagging her finger at all those sinners and late arrivals in the back pew. &#8220;You folks better listen up, he&rsquo;s talkng about YOU!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the attitude of the average white liberal in America.  Being &#8220;holier than thou&#8221; is the primary preoccupation of these folk.  The only difference with the Church Lady is that their morality is a mush of social-marxism, watered down Christianity, and Secular Humanism.  Add to that mush a good dose of low self esteem and you have the twisted mind of the average white liberal.</p>

			<p>     But Moral Masturbation is so much fun! Seriously, these people are consumed by it. They are very serious about their fan-<br>
tasies-they pass laws, persecute, imprison, and in the near fut-<br>
ure they will probably begin mass roundups. It is a Plague and it<br>
may well be the end of us. It will certainly be the end of this<br>
phase of Western Civilization and many of the current countries.<br>
Our Race is about to undergo a massive genetic die off. Like a<br>
fever, it will either kill the  patient or kill the disease. No<br>
middle ground at all. No one gets to sit this one out. And not<br>
to choose is to choose racial death by miscegenation. We must<br>
strike out like the Afrikaaners of old. The Northwest is the best.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor is all upset because his Afro Carib tribe has been totally overwhelmed by African Africans, Asians, and middle easterners.</p>
<p>The newcomers are taking coucil housing, benefits, affirmative action school admissions, jobs, and entire tribal territories away from his Afro Carib tribe.  Afro Caribs are being made marginal by the invading tribes. They are no longer the precious, petted minority.  Boo hoo</p>
<p>The Afro Carib tribe is going through what the indigenious English natives went through in 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s when their territories were invaded and taken over by the Afro Caribs.</p>
<p>Hah hah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor has changed his views only because of the invasion of other tribes. Were it still just Afro Caribs and the idiot intelligentsia vs the indigenous English, &#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor would still be leading marches demanding that police stay out of Afro Carib territories and writing his New Statesmen articles accusing English old ladies of racism for being afraid when 4 or 5 menacing, strutting Afro Carib thugs invade their subway car.</p>
<p>Afro Caribs are the most violent, disfunctional and dangerous of all the squabbling tribes who inhabit that Island between the continent and Ireland formerly known as Britian.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;Day that shall live in infamy&#8221; for Britian was that day in  1948 when the ship Windermere landed with the first load of Afro Caribs. </p>
<p>What goes around, comes around Trevor.  You and your tribe had a good 40 year run against the Whites.  Now it is the turn of other tribes to destroy your tribe.</p>

			<p>Thank you Alucard&hellip;I like it when someone can actually speak up and say what needs to be said. I feel the same way. MANY of us do. I just wish there were more of us on this site with the guts to NOT beat around the bush. Down with ambiguity&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;the 90&rsquo;s are over. So are the 00&rsquo;s, almost. We CANNOT let the black osamian cult dictate our thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t suffer from White guilt&#8221;</p>
<p>This needs to be told to anyone who even so much as brings up the subject of black osama. Especially if they make the claim that they voted for him.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start this now&hellip;!</p>

			<p><b> &#8220;to my children&rsquo;s generation, race isn&rsquo;t an issue.<br>
The growing number of mixed-race children &hellip;. are evidence of that. Beige is the new black and white.&rdquo; </b></p>
<p><i>What utter arrogance! What absurdity! What perversion! Mixed-race children are the ideal?!!     &mdash;    what a nicompoop, as are all the so-called conservatives in Britain. Too damned scared to fight for the preservation to the white British people.</i><br>

Correct!  This Littlejohn pretends to be a sympathetic friend of whites   &mdash;    a sneaky pressure valve type, as someone said above   &mdash;    but along with his commiseration, <b><i>he slyly slips in his race-mixing propaganda. </i></b> He is really no friend at all.   Phony &#8220;friends&#8221; like that we don&rsquo;t need.</p>

			<p>This automatically disqualifies anyone who identifies themselves with the Left OR the Right.</p>
<p>Maybe the whole Left and Right thing among Whites is the very source of the problem, the very source of the verbal cancer eathing away at the Psyche and Spirit of Modern Man. It very well may be. In that case, we should remove it with as much skill, and as much mercy, as a Doctor shows while removing a cancerous tumor from a still-living human body.<br>

Wow!  You can say that again!   Thanks Dedalus.</p>
<p>This whole  Left vs. Right thing and the endless squabbling that goes on between them reminds me of the medieval feuding between the Gnostics and Arians and the Manicheans and the Albigensians, and  the Guelphs and the Ghibellines or&hellip;.. well,  you get the idea. </p>
<p>Who ever hears of them today?  Who cares?    <br>
But back then, they would have killed you for your beliefs.    Now, we can see it today as all nonsense.</p>
<p>I also hearily endorse Mark  (&#8220;Blacks are just pawns&#8221;)   and also Schoolteacher (&#8220;Play the moderate, calm the masses, and let them get used to the [coloureds] they already have&#8221;) and Memphomaniac  (&#8220;Far from being a mindless bigotry, race realism is based on information that is true&#8221;). If only our people could have the awareness of these posters above, our problems would be half-way solved.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;remove it with as much skill, and as much mercy, as a Doctor&#8221;</p>
<p>Drivel&hellip;in other words&hellip;comprimise. Unacceptable. Liberal cowards do not comprimse. It&rsquo;s your exact way of thinking that got this country into the mess it is. I do agree that the proverbial &#8220;war of words&#8221; needs to come to an end.</p>
<p>Peace isn&rsquo;t natural, war is natural. This is what usually ends up solving matters. People such as yourself believe that the pen is mightier than the sword. It can be for awhile, but in the end, the sword cuts paper.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that war should always be avoided no matter what. Even if it means giving in. Well, we all can&rsquo;t be France. They at least had other countries to bail them out.</p>
<p>We do not. I do agree with the idea of cold or covert war as a means to prelude. But it needs to get physical sooner or latter. The media left controls 99% of every aspect of what we know as &#8220;press&#8221;. You can label it squabling all you want. But they&rsquo;re winning. And their minorities will eventually come for us.</p>
<p>And they won&rsquo;t be brandishing pens. Don&rsquo;t be a defeatist. Don&rsquo;t let the black osamian cult tell you how to live. Our younger people need to know this. They do not have to tolerate a lower standard of living because someone else said so.</p>

			<p>To non-racially aware white persons:<br>
<b>Race</b> should be your <b>religion</b> and your <b>politics</b>. <br>
It is for every other race.<br>
Why do people pretend the elephant is not in the room?<br>
Get real white folk&hellip;.your skin is your uniform!<br>
That is the reality whether you like it or not.<br>
There should be NO SHAME in that.</p>
