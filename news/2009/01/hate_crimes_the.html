			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily, January 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; bill that officially is to enhance punishments for &#8220;violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery&#8221; but is feared by Christians as a potential bludgeon against basic biblical teachings has been returned to the congressional agenda by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas.</p>
<p>The proposal had been stymied during the Bush administration by the president&rsquo;s threat of a veto but President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s own website has promised an expansion of federal &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; laws.</p>
<p>The bill, the &#8220;David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009,&#8221; has been pending in Congress in one form or another since at least 2007 but never was advanced into law because of stated opposition from President Bush, who found it unneeded and probably unconstitutional.</p>
<p>However, the plan by Jackson-Lee, who has advocated for the special protections for those with issues involving &#8220;gender identity,&#8221; already has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for the 2009 Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new twist for 2009, however, is the introduction of a companion piece of legislation by Jackson-Lee that would &#8220;provide support services for victims of hate crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary as well as the Committees on Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Education and Labor, Oversight and others.</p>
<p>It allows victims of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; to take federally authorized family and medical leave and collect unemployment insurance, creates grants for housing for such victims and provides counseling and &#8220;related assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well down in the long list of provisions in the second plan is an attempt to &#8220;establish and operate a national clearinghouse and resource center for information and statistics relating to &hellip; hate crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;clearinghouse&#8221; would be run by &#8220;a private nonprofit organization,&#8221; according to the legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson-Lee&rsquo;s bill says Congress &#8220;finds that&#8221; crimes motivated by &#8220;the actual or perceived &hellip; sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also alleges the &#8220;violence&#8221; related to such crimes impedes interstate commerce because members of &#8220;targeted groups&#8221; cannot purchase goods and services.</p>
<p>Jackson-Lee also claims that the &#8220;violence&#8221; is &#8220;motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery.&#8221;<br>

								<h2>Discrimination Bill Draws Large Crowd</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Karamagi Rujumba, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 16, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilwoman Amanda Green, D-Stanton Heights, introduced the proposal in July.</p>
<p>The bill would prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, marital status, gender identity or sexual orientation. It also would create a 16-member commission to investigate reports of discrimination in county government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But speaking in support of the bill, the Rev. Janet Edwards, a minister in the Presbyterian Church, USA, said, &#8220;religious arguments are bogus&#8221; when they engender a status quo that perpetuates bigotry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denise Edwards, a Wilkinsburg councilwoman, said the borough&rsquo;s council voted unanimously to support the county-wide measure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill is co-sponsored by council President Rich Fitzgerald, D-Squirrel Hill, and council members Jim Burn, D-Millvale, Nick Futules, D-Verona, William Robinson, D-Hill District, Joan Cleary, D-Brentwood, and Charles Martoni, D-Swissvale.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of work to do with it,&#8221; said Mr. Fitzgerald [Rich Fitzgerald, council president]. &#8220;We still have to see whether we can afford to implement it and how it will be enforced, so we still have a long way to go.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I guess these folks feel they need to differentiate between these terrible, evil &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; committed and thought about by evil White heterosexual &#8220;Christians&#8221; as opposed to the other non hate crime, crimes of rape, murder, car jacking, hi-jacking airplanes and crashing them in to New York Office buildings. These crimes that are not considered &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; must be &#8220;love crimes&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the Wichita Massacre Knoxville Horror and all the 500 plus murders in my home town of Chicago must be &#8220;love crimes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For &#8220;love crimes&#8221; the preferred punishment is more&hellip;</p>
<p>Love, understanding, community organizing for the poor, oppressed people who do these love crimes to call attention to their situations, feelings of alienation in a RACIST society.</p>

		<p>Schoolteacher is right.  If this legislation passes, look for a massive increase in &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; as more and more members of favored groups claim to be victims to get the goodies.  A black man would be considered a &#8220;victim&#8221; for such things as white women clutching their purses when they pass or for having difficulty stopping a cab.</p>

<p>The Constitution guarantees my right, as an individual, to freely assemble. Then the government turns around and dictates which groups I must not exclude, and in that sense must INCLUDE, when I assemble. If this is not the antithesis of freedom I do not know what is.</p>

		<p>Ok, I think we have our first &#8220;great divide&#8221; piece of legislation of the Obamanation Admin.It looks Obama&rsquo;s chief of staff Emanuel is backing away from out and out illegals amnesty not wanting to incite an open populist rebellion from the get go.</p>
<p>We need to mobilize on the hate crime legislation and try to do what we did to defeat the mass amnesty.</p>
<p>I and others will be doing the time consuming/expensive work to get the names and contact information of all the US Congress/Senate staff members - so activists can contact these staff members by name, engage in one to one lobbying to beat back this monster.</p>
<p>Some of Christian Right will work on this as the hate crimes bill is designed to criminalize Biblical criticism of homosexuality - but don&rsquo;t rely on the Christian Right to do much in this country except to bomb Iraq, back Neo Con everything.</p>
<p>This is an excellent issue to rally regular Americans against encroaching PC/Orwellian control of the media, government, universities. Lot&rsquo;s of Americans like the 1st Amendment and will fight those from whatever direction Right, Left who try to take away our individual freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Please PM if you are interested in getting active on this. Our goals should be to defeat this hate crimes bill and also build an internet based activist network that can mobilize millions of effective activists.</p>

		<p>I wonder when this will shut down the web sites us white males use to vent and seek advice. Some of the sites may attempt to move offshore, but obama&rsquo;s big plan is for the US to fall under the authority of the UN. Moving off shore will not help in that case. </p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much hope left. I read the news daily and shake my head in amazement. I often wonder what I can do besides calling and e-mailing my elected representatives. They seemed to have all lost their nerve. Once obama is seated, I imagine most people will not challenge his ideas for fear of being called racist or hateful. </p>
<p>America selected two of the absolute worst candidates to run for office. When these sorts of things are happening, what is next? How can you get our young mostly educated in propaganda filled public schools to understand their freedom is being given away. They celebrate thinking just the opposite.</p>

		<p>Where do we draw the line with what is a hate crime now?  Is anything refused to a black a hate crime?  If a black steals from your store you can&rsquo;t stop him or call the cops because that will be a hate crime?  If a black asks me to have sex with him and I say no will that be a hate crime?  Quite frankly I think it is time to consider getting the hell outta Dodge, and yes, I mean leave the country.  It&rsquo;s lost now.</p>

		<p>you know if these &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; laws did not favor certain favored groups I would not object to them.  In practice they seem to work almost entirely to the advantage of the so called &#8220;favorable minority groups&#8221; without many if any exceptions. In no way should free speech be in any way  curtailed though.</p>

		<p>If hate crimes extend to thoughts and their expression, then the only recourse is to go underground for the truth. A principal reason for the freedom of speech is so that people don&rsquo;t have to go underground and become potentially dangerous just because they say things that hurt other&rsquo;s feelings, even if true. History is replete over and over with the need to go covet because of an oppressive state which forbids free expression. </p>

		<p>If Question Diversity is reading, you might appreciate my attempt at potentially preventing a hate crime, since you seem to be from St. Louis. I was visiting my family over the Christmas break in St. Louis when I happened to be at the QT on St. Charles Rock and I-70 one night. An elderly white couple on their way to Georgia, was poring over a map and I could sense their frustration and anxiety. I-64 was shut down between I-170 and Kingshighway. They concluded that they should stay on the Rock Rd. then turn right on Kingshighway,then access I-64. I strongly advised against that plan (and you know why) and encouraged them to take I-70 downtown, cross the Poplar Ave. bridge, then access I-64. They weren&rsquo;t happy with my suggestion because downtown looked too confusing on the map and they wanted to get on I-64 before downtown. I again expressed my disapproval and drew them a detailed map. They accepted it and thanked me. I can only hope they made it out OK,I&rsquo;m at least glad that they filled up in Bridgeton instead of further on down the road.</p>

		<p>The real goal of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation is to build a bridge towards &#8220;thought crimes&#8221; legislation. We don&rsquo;t care if you have an opinion, you&rsquo;d better not even think the way your thinking, if you want to stay out of trouble.</p>

<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right in a sense, up until a few weeks ago, I lived in St. Louis and am a native.  I moved to Carbondale, IL for a new job after the first of the year.</p>
<p>As for your suggestion, I-70 through the city can be just as bad, for their sakes I hope they didn&rsquo;t break down on 70 anywhere between 170 and 255 over on the east side, otherwise, one of the worthies who live along there would have robbed them for sure.</p>
<p>The best way would have been to tell them to go west on the Rock Road, the get on 270 north, and take 270 across the Chain of Rocks into Illinois, then south on 255 to 64, east on 64.  Though North County is mostly black, you&rsquo;re not in North County for way too long.  The way to avoid blacks as much as possible would have been for them to get on 70 west at the Rock Road, then 270 south, which turns into 255 east in South County, across the JB Bridge into IL, follow 255 to 64, then 64 east.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know. I was trying,albeit pathetically, to be tongue in cheek, since the topic was about hate crimes. The elderly man who was driving was a stubborn old coot, and I got the impression that he figured it out and was going that way no matter what. After explaining the potentially dire consequences of being caucasian, at night, with a backseat full of presents in that neighborhood, he replied that he wasn&rsquo;t scared of anyone and that he could take care of himself. I suggested I-70,trying to appeal to his sense of practicality, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to stop at all those red lights. Incidentally, St. Charles Rock Rd. becomes MLK Dr. just before entering the St. Louis city limits. As other people have wisely posted, if in a strange city,to stay away from any street named MLK.</p>
