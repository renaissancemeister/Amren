<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several Muslim soldiers refused to fight in Afghanistan, citing their faith, according to the blog release &#8220;Secret Defense, confirmed by the Army.</p>
<p>These are young Muslims who did not want to fight other Muslims in Afghanistan, &#8220;wrote Liberation journalist Jean-Dominique Merchet on his blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;The refusal to go on a mission for reasons faith is a micro-phenomenon that involves less than five cases a year,&#8221; said Colonel Benoit Royal, head of Information and Public Relations of the Army (SIRPA -Earth), questioned by AFP.</p>
<p>It reflects in his view, &#8220;beyond the reason given by the soldiers, an error of understanding of the meaning of their commitment to bear arms of France to defend its interests and values at all times and in all places&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also according to the Royal Colonel, &#8220;a disciplinary procedure is systematically engaged in case of refusal to go into operation, resulting in most cases to termination of contract&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lib√©ration&rsquo;s blog states that a case was reported last October in the 1st Infantry Regiment Sarrebourg (Moselle). The soldier is, however, reversed his decision after having met a Muslim army chaplain.</p>
<p>Fell ill while he was to leave the stage of preparation, the soldier will only be sent by Afghanistan as planned next month, also confirmed by Colonel Royal.</p>
<p>The number of French soldiers of the Muslim faith is unknown, said &#8220;Secret Defense&#8221;, the French law prohibiting recognition of religion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The number of French soldiers of the Muslim faith is unknown, said &ldquo;Secret Defense&rdquo;, the French law prohibiting recognition of religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is now approximatively 30% to 40% soldiers of non-european origins in the french army.</p>
<p>So I can guess around 25% of soldiers are muslims.</p>

			<p>Good for them not to fight other Middle Easterners.  I will never fight other White men. When the Brits and Germans throw off their chains and the U.S. government<br>
demands we fight them..I will not. WWI and WWII were disasters for white people. Never again should we fight each other. </p>

			<p>Ah, yes, another strength of diversity.</p>
<p>You know, if I keep reading stories like this so much I just might get the impression that diversity isn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Then it will be time to take me to the re-education camps to make certain my mind is right, so I can see clearly,</p>

			<p>I wonder how many military officers in the West recognize that the countries they are sworn to defend are disappearing?  I&rsquo;m certain that they are well-informed about the abilities of their diverse troops, because armies are the largest systematic compilers of aptitude tests.  I&rsquo;m equally certain that they would know better than to say what they know if they expect to stay in the ranks.  But who&rsquo;s side are they really on?</p>

			<p>And were the Muzzies executed? No. So much for French military disipline as displayed in the movie &#8220;Paths of Glory.&#8221; Islamics are religionists FIRST, and nothing after. Muzzies were portrayd as courageous in a recent French film, &#8220;Days of Glory,&#8221; but obviously the new breed of Islamics intends to &#8220;take out&#8221; the West.</p>

			<p>Muslims may be the one group that has been getting the most annoying and rediculous. All they do is demand equal rights and catering to their population, all the while MUSLIM terrorist groups cause mass destruction and death all around the world. They aren&rsquo;t just a burden to whites, but also to all non-muslims on the planet.</p>
<p>And the fact that people actually are willing to give in to their demands is even more horrifying and disgusting.</p>

			<p>Every Muslim is required to fight jihad against the West or he is non-compliant with his religion.  France is being unreasonable to expect anything less.</p>

			<p> French government, this should show you where their<br>
loyalties lie. So much for them graciuosly repaying <br>
you, while you bend over backwards to meet their <br>
every need. But I suppose Sarkozy is terrified that <br>
if he forces them to fight. Cars will be set ablaze<br>
and riots will break out all over France. The<br>
&#8220;enrichment&#8221; and &#8220;strength&#8221; of diversity is on<br>
display yet again.</p>

<p>I have witnessed no reluctance to fight other muslims by muslims in 5 years in the middle east war, to include Afghan, Iraq and Kuwait. They seem most willing to do the most atrocious things to each other and I have photos to prove it. They are also willing to do these same things to other religions and nationalities also.</p>

			<p>I am sure we will soon hear as we have from England and other regions that their Muslims are going to Afghanistan and fighting with the Taliban.  It is probably going on now, but France likely suppresses that information and holds its soldiers to silence on this issue on the threat of solitary confinement in a French military prison.</p>

			<p>Well I guess this should be a wake up call for young whites to take care of their nations so their government won&rsquo;t have to find others. In France they had young strong able body men to be in their military then they wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem.Even now they are go in numbers with minorties (350,000 people in the military). Same goes for the rest of Europe and North America. In America the border patrol is under staffed and 52% hispanic. With border states suffering from job loss can&rsquo;t get whites but only people of color. </p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s common sense to join the border patrol it&rsquo;s physical requirements are easy, it&rsquo;s not mentally demanding, and it&rsquo;s very patrotic.</p>

			<p> One of the fist things both President Karzai and the then acting president of Iraq (I can&rsquo;t remember his name) did after we put them in office, was to remind us that they were Muslim first .It even made the liberal news, I remember it .</p>

<p>Not likely! the muslims almost have enough of them in place in the Emerald Isles to take over and they (muslims and Saudi) will not want to reduce the number of soldiers on the Isles. They will continue to elect muslims to office and when the white brits catch on and move to stop it, the violence will begin.</p>
