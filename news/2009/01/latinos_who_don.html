<h1><a href="https://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=122043">Latinos Who Don&rsquo;t Speak Spanish Object to Getting Criticized for It</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Corza, Reading Eagle Press (Reading, Pennsylvania), January 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many people say that if people who are of Latin descent don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, they are not considered Latino.</p>
<p>Celestino Corza, 13, a seventh-grader at Wyomissing Junior-Senior High School, says, &#8220;I think you&rsquo;re a Latino even if you don&rsquo;t speak Spanish. I don&rsquo;t. But my dad was born in Mexico so I still consider myself a Latino.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So what do you call it when Latinos discriminate against other Latinos?</p>
<p>Anthony Perez, 16, a sophomore at Reading High says, &#8220;Other Puerto Ricans treat me different. They don&rsquo;t really consider me Puerto Rican because I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish. But it&rsquo;s not fair because it&rsquo;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nick Revilla, 16, a sophomore at Reading High, says, &#8220;I tried to learn Spanish at school but it&rsquo;s not easy. I wish my parents would have taught me when I was younger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parents often wish their children would learn a second language but some parents miss the opportunity to teach their native language to their children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fact that these students don&rsquo;t speak Spanish doesn&rsquo;t stop them from feeling proud to be a Latino. They still represent their ancestors&rsquo; countries and celebrate the same customs.</p>
<p>Antonio says, &#8220;I like being Mexican because I&rsquo;ve seen the worst sides of other races and I feel like we work harder for the things we have and (we) have gone through more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Latinos celebrate their countries&rsquo; independence day in the United States and make big celebrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anthony says, &#8220;That&rsquo;s my favorite thing about being a Latino. My skin color is so nice. It&rsquo;s like a caramel color.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nick says, &#8221; I don&rsquo;t think they would accept me because I don&rsquo;t know Spanish. They don&rsquo;t really think you&rsquo;re Puerto Rican if you don&rsquo;t speak Spanish. If I went to Puerto Rico today, I wouldn&rsquo;t have as many friends or life as I do here in the U.S. They would probably make fun of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anthony says, &#8220;Some of my friends are Latinos and then they start to speak Spanish, and I feel a little weird &#8216;cause I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying, but they understand me. They accept me here. I wish I could say it would be that way in Puerto Rico.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just ask around and see if people of other ethnicities know their country&rsquo;s native language. Many would probably say no, so why are Latinos getting put down for it?<br>

			<p>If you live in America and you speak English, tell the others to go take a flying leap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m half Polish and I don&rsquo;t know the language.  I have some German and I only know a few words of German.  I have a tiny bit of French and I can read some of it.  I have some Cherokee, don&rsquo;t know any Cherokee language.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m an American, I speak English, that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>

			<p>You call them Latinos.  It is well known (to some I guess) that in Mexico for example, the various ethnic groups look down on the other.  Finding ways to look down on others is a big part of Latino culture.</p>

			<p>The average black who has been born, reared, and educated in this country, appears incapable of communicating in English without a translator. Rather than being criticized within their communities, they tend to be praised for not &#8220;acting too white.&#8221; </p>
<p>Similarly, Latinos are now apparently being criticized for &#8220;acting too Anglo.&#8221; So it stands to reason that they would be praised for not speaking English [or at least not speaking it as well as they do Spanish].</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the primary premise of diversity was that people from different races, lifestyles, and cultures would be mutually benefited from their association with one another.</p>
<p>Were that the case, then why would these politically correct minorities want to retain the very signature of their separation?</p>

			<p>This is all a result of the far leftist massive push towards multiculturalism. If assimilation to English, and American traditions, etc.was demanded of people as it always was in this nations history, until the communist left dismantled it, there would be no hispanic on hispanic discrimination. All hispanics would consider themselves Americans who speak English, as their main language. Some older generation hispanics in Texas for example as well as other states, haven&rsquo;t a clue about Mexico,etc. and couldn&rsquo;t care less. There are generations long Mexican malcontents living in the U.S., but they are in the minority  &mdash;  something the left including leftist hispanic power groups want to &#8220;fix&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This is analogous to blacks who don&rsquo;t speak Ebonics and have perfect English grammar are described as being not an authentic black.  </p>

			<p>At one job I had a couple years ago, my boss was half-mexican.  She was born and raised in America, but only spoke English.  A hispanic salesman asked her why she didn&rsquo;t speak spanish, simply because she had a spanish name, to which I said to him, &#8220;I have a German last name.  Does that mean I should speak German?&#8221;  Coincidentally, I was pressured to resign from my job soon after that.  I blame it on &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.</p>

			<p><i>They don&rsquo;t really consider me Puerto Rican because I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish.</i></p>
<p>This is on a par with blacks who don&rsquo;t consider others to be &#8220;truly&#8221; or &#8220;authentically&#8221; black if they don&rsquo;t subscribe to a certain set of beliefs  &mdash;  no matter how dark their skin.</p>
<p>This Latino discrimination against non-spanish speakers is just another sign of their unwillingness to assimilate.</p>

Ben Wattenberg, a man I despise, used to insist during discussions on the wave of new immigrants that hispanics wanted to learn English. Then he would famously wave papers saying something to the affect, &#8216;see, I have the facts right here&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hispanics don&rsquo;t want to learn English and have no intention to and have no need. They expect us to accommodate them. It&rsquo;s that straightfoward.</p>

<p>Look at what we have here! A Latino &#8220;racist.&#8221; Surely the commies would be all over the white man had he said these words!<br>

			<p>A friend of mine in Vancouver is of Chinese descent but born and raised in Canada. English is her language, and she&rsquo;s completely westernized. Since Hong Kong immigrants began pouring into Vancouver, she says she&rsquo;s been getting increasingly uncomfortable. The nasty reaction they give her when they learn that she can&rsquo;t speak Cantonese is shocking. She&rsquo;s even been kicked and slapped. It infuriates her, of course, but what can she do? As an English-speaker, she&rsquo;s lower down on the totem pole than someone who doesn&rsquo;t know either of Canada&rsquo;s two official languages, even if they are of the same ethnic origin.</p>

			<p>The sad experience of Anonymous 8:44 PM, shows the danger to White men of becoming involved in the conflicts of Minority groups. Whether the conflict is inter-group or intra-group, a White man&rsquo;s obtrusion will be detested, and the White man may suffer for it. This often applies to Female and homosexual groups, as well.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know but let me ask: &#8220;What do you call it&hellip; when our government officials refuse to heed the will of the American citizen voters and FLOOD our nation with unwanted immigrant? Never mind whether legal OR illegal.</p>

A woman in my office was born in the Dominican Republic and came here at the age of ten. She went through school here and never returned to the D.R. (she couldn&rsquo;t go back, as her family were political refugees and would be killed, as her father and brother were).  She is now in her mid-50s.  She  speaks only broken, mangled  English, at best.  Most of the day, she&rsquo;s on the telephone, gabbing in Spanish. Her social circle is entirely Spanish-speaking. She orders food (in Spanish)  from Dominican restaurants, reads Spanish magazines, etc.  Nearly her whole life here is conducted in Spanish.  How she got all the way through our schools here, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a miracle, but obviously she hasn&rsquo;t had to learn English.  </p>
<p>I had thought at first that she was here only a few years or else came here later in life;  but when I asked her when she came here, and she said ten, I was flabbergasted.<br>

			<p>I know some Hispanics who detest the term latino (or latina). I also know some who would get very offended if you lumped them in with Puerto Ricans, who they consider to be 1/2 black. And I know of one person who hates the term latino and hispanic and want to be simply called american of mexican heritage. </p>
<p>Oddly enough what comes to mind is the tv show &#8220;top chef&#8221;. There&rsquo;s a guy from Italy on it and an Italian-American. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d bond over their common heritage. Nope, the Italian hangs with the Scandanavian dude and the American makes fun of them both. Heh.</p>

<p>&gt; I had to quit a job because of this same type of thing plus the corruption - fraud at a California based health care facility.  The truth is that Latinos are not very well educated and confuse nationalism with racism.  And that is just the tip of the ignorance iceberg.  I have also been pressured out of jobs by White women who simply ganged up on me.  There wasn&rsquo;t even a political issue in those instances, it was just bullying on the job and general disrespect for a doctor who wasn&rsquo;t paying their salary.</p>

			<p>  Mexicans can never fully assimilate. Even if they learn English, so what? They&rsquo;re not white or black. White people built this country for white people. Mexicans will always resent this fact. As for blacks, it was a mistake bringing them over here.</p>

I thought Puerto Ricans were 80% white? Mostly from Spain. Mexicans are mestizos who have mostly Indian blood. Who&rsquo;s more white?</p>
