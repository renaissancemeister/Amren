<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090127/Hartford.Mayor/">Hartford, Conn., Mayor Arrested on Bribery Charges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hartford&rsquo;s mayor turned himself in Tuesday on charges of having a city contractor do $40,000 in work at his home and paying for it only after being confronted by investigators.</p>
<p>Eddie A. Perez, a native of Puerto Rico and the first Hispanic mayor in the city&rsquo;s history, called his conduct inappropriate but said he did not commit a crime. He pledged to remain in office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez, the Democratic mayor of Connecticut&rsquo;s capital city since 2001, was charged with receiving a bribe and falsifying evidence.</p>
<p>The contractor, Carlos Costa, told investigators he believed he would be shut out of lucrative city contracts had he not done the work for free, prosecutors said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Costa, who was awarded a $5 million city streetscape contract, did the kitchen and bathroom renovations at Perez&rsquo;s home in 2005. Perez paid $20,000 for the work in 2007, but only after being questioned by a grand jury probing possible corruption in city government, prosecutors said. Neither Costa nor Perez obtained building permits for the work, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>According to warrants in the case, investigators found &#8220;numerous instances&#8221; where Perez intervened in matters to help Costa, such as by pressing city workers to pay Costa&rsquo;s bills faster than other municipal contractors.</p>
<p>Costa was charged Monday with two counts of bribery, fabricating evidence and conspiracy to fabricate evidence in connection to the case.</p>
<p>Perez is charged with receiving a bribe, fabricating physical evidence and conspiracy to fabricate evidence. The felonies can bring a maximum sentence of five to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another city hall employee, Edward Lazu, was charged with one count of receiving a bribe, fabricating evidence and three counts of forgery.</p>
<p>Costa did free driveway and sidewalk work for Lazu, who certifies contractors for city work, prosecutors said. Costa told investigators that he considered the work &#8220;the cost of doing business&#8221; in Hartford.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez&rsquo;s attorney, Hubert Santos, said the conduct outlined in the arrest affadavit doesn&rsquo;t constitute a crime. He said the mayor always intended to pay for Costa&rsquo;s renovation work, but that Perez was slowing in paying the bills because his wife became ill.</p>

			<p>So, I wonder what we might have found out about our Messiah in Chief had Fitzy not terminated his investigation early. But then, we&rsquo;ll never know now, will we?</p>

<p>Gee, what a surprise.  His lawyer&rsquo;s name is Santos.  I never would have guessed he would prefer a Hispanic over an Anglo.</p>
<p>Connecticut itself has been turned to the far left beginning years ago via small corrupt publications throughout the state that have a far left agenda.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true with a lot of the East Coast territory.</p>

			<p>When you import hispanics, you import the corrupt, criminal, disfunctional countries from which they came.</p>

			<p>Politicians run for office to feed at the public trough. I will bet the public gets the benifit of around ten cents on the dollar after the corrupt politicians get through feeding. <br>

			<p>Ah the joy of politics&hellip; get yourself elected mayor, get the contractors to kick back to you&hellip; in cash or in work. Which ultimately gets PAID by the local taxpayers. Yeah, sleazo White politicians do it too&hellip; but with minorities, you can take graft and corruption for granted, if they get elected.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve seen his name before.  It seems not that long ago that we were reading what a great job this new Puerto Rican mayor was doing, how he represented hope and new life for the decaying city, and how he was going to turn the city around.  Sure!</p>
<p>He was an Obama on a smaller scale   &mdash;   not quite a messiah, but the new face for the future, representing hope and change.</p>

			<p>Another diversified New England state. A once glorious, revered area of our great country. Fought for and freed from tyranny. Our ancestors died to make it what America was meant to be.</p>
<p>Now a minoritorial cesspit.</p>
<p>With a lowlife mayor who was undoubtedly voted in by liberal whites. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, these liberals no longer get the privilege of being considered &#8220;white&#8221;. We all need to take this stand. They need to be divided&hellip;then conquered. They&rsquo;re easily scattered&hellip;cowards usually are.</p>
<p>Oh, BTW, he got an hispanic lawyer so that if he has to play he race card, it&rsquo;ll be more convincing. Actually, any brown lawyer at all is one giant race card in itself. Liberals and the press tend to respond to them better. More afraid of them&hellip;fewer to speak out against him.</p>
