<h1>Dutch MP Behind Film on Radical Islam: Decision to Prosecute Me Is Political</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cnaan Liphshitz, Haaretz, January 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, the director of a controversial film on radical Islam, says the decision by the Amsterdam Court of Appeals on Wednesday to prosecute him for allegedly inciting hatred against Muslims was strictly political.</p>
<p>&#8220;It puts hundreds of thousands of Dutchmen on trial for opposing Islam&rsquo;s violent messages,&#8221; the MP told Haaretz on Thursday.</p>
<p>Wilders, a controversial rightist politician and head of the Netherlands&rsquo; Party for Freedom, will be prosecuted for the alleged offense  &mdash;  which he denies  &mdash;  with connection to a short film he made last year linking the Koran to violence against Jews, Christians and Muslims.</p>
<p>The 14-minute film, which turned the already-famous Wilders into an internationally known figure, mostly features archive footage of hate speeches by Muslim clerics, one of whom was calling for the &#8220;beheading of all Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film, which aims to present &#8220;the violent nature of Islam,&#8221; as Wilders defines it, also urges Muslims to &#8220;tear out&#8221; violent passages from the Koran and equates fanatical Islam to Nazism.</p>
<p>In the interview on Thursday, Wilders maintained that his film, entitled Fitna, is within the boundaries of Dutch law and freedom of expression. &#8220;I consulted numerous legal authorities before releasing the film,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Things are not looking good for me. In its 33-page ruling ordering my prosecution, the appeals court already determined I was guilty. Now the case will be reviewed by a lower court and there&rsquo;s every chance the judge will align his ruling with the appeals courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the conversation he said: &#8220;I hope this thing doesn&rsquo;t end behind bars.&#8221; As Wilders has not yet been charged, the maximum penalty for the alleged transgressions remains unclear.</p>
<p>If Wilders appeals a future conviction, his appeal will be heard before the same court which ordered his prosecution.</p>
<p>Before the Court of Appeals ordered to prosecute Wilders, Amsterdam&rsquo;s chief public prosecutor, Leo de Wit, said last month that no case will be brought against Wilders in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>But Wilders, whose party holds nine seats in parliament, is also being prosecuted in absentia in Jordan for &#8220;blasphemy and contempt of Muslims&#8221; because of the film.</p>
<p>During a visit last month to Jerusalem for an international anti-Jihad conference, Wilders spoke about the charges pending against him back home. &#8220;Luckily, the Dutch legal system is different to Jordan&rsquo;s,&#8221; he told Haaretz then. On Thursday, he ironically noted that &#8220;the Jordanians can now be satisfied with themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trial, which sets the stage for a high-profile affair likely to expose changing attitudes towards Islam in Europe, is also expected to center around public comparisons which Wilders drew in Dutch media between the Koran and Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s Mein Kampf.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Luckily, the Dutch legal system is different to Jordan&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>In this case the legal systems are going to appear to be the same and it bodes ill for Mr. Wilders. As I said, the Dutch government is going to crumble and hand Mr. Wilders over to the Jordanians and an almost certain beheading<br>

			<p>These prosecutions take place within individual countries based on national laws. However, we are influenced by ideas that originate around the world. In Canada, Mark Steyn was prosecuted but found innocent for his book America Alone which contains similar material to this film. If someone in Holland reads Steyn&rsquo;s book, he might assume that it&rsquo;s legal to say the same things in Holland. Or someone in Canada might hear of this Dutch prosecution and assume it is illegal to say certain things which are actually legal to say in Canada.</p>

			<p>This is so incredibly sick it&rsquo;s unbelievable.  A Dutch man being prosecuted by his own people for making a movie about Islam. I wonder if a Muslim country would prosecute one of their own because he made a movie about capitalism?  Whites are the only group that persecute their own for saying anything negative about other groups.  Many Whites around the world are cutting their own nose to spite their face for this insane diversity madness. </p>
<p>I am very much afraid that this is the death knoll for White civilization.  If Whites as a group don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s taking place soon all is going to be lost.    </p>

			<p>Who prescribed the insanity? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out. We shall be a minority in the U.S. in several decades - and if you don&rsquo;t &#8220;celebrate&#8221; that, well of course you are a racist. If you express concern for your people and the world that your children are growing into, you are a &#8220;nazi&#8221;. It&rsquo;s getting rather difficult to determine exactly what &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;nazism&#8221; are or were, since both terms are used to describe the most luke warm and mundane events with increasing frequency. </p>
<p>Regarding the impending fall of the U.S. (as I certainly see it), one may hear folks say &#8220;well, there&rsquo;s always Europe&#8221;. The problem is, they are walzing through the same cultural suicide.</p>
<p>I sincerely respect and appreciate Geert Wilders for his efforts and courage. The same goes for Jared Taylor. The climate these men fight in is vicious to say the least!</p>

			<p>The first in a long line of steps towards a tyrannical, undemocratic Islamic Europe. White people, and patriotic law-abiding persons everywhere, should be very afraid of these developments. </p>

			<p>So, the Appeals Court decides he has committed aa offence ahead of a court hearing, then refers it to a lower court to prosecute him and, if found guilty, he is then obliged to seek &#8220;justice&#8221; from the Appeals Court that ordered his prosecution.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like justice to me. Kangaroo Court more like.</p>
<p>It does however reflect the reality of life in Europe for ordinary Europeans.  </p>

			<p>They are prosecuting the guy who made a movie, not the crazies who yell and scream &#8220;death to the Jews&#8221;.<br>
Madness.<br>

			<p>Does anyone notice that they give out film awards (and dinner party reservations - and positive media interviews) for this kind of movie? If it&rsquo;s done for the cause of those on the left, or even for muslims youths themselves. </p>

			<p>Europe is wrong to think appeasement of bullying agressive muslims will work. It will only embolden them.</p>

Holland is a tiny country that lives off its international trade. It is a very commercial, money-conscious society which would do anything to please/appease their trading partners who are their life blood. The Arab states have big money, and the Dutch would bend down and kiss their, ahem   &mdash;   feet   &mdash;   to get some of that money. In Holland everything is negotiable and everything has its price. Including justice, obviously.</p>

			<p>Islamization of Europe&hellip;were the EU gods not recently discussing importing tens of millions of Africans for &#8220;work&#8221;? Certainly many black Africans are not Muslims. I think the point is to weaken the white nations in an effort to prevent any viable resistance. I see the Muslims as being the tool in this particular theatre. The same ends can be achieved in the US through using the tool that is the Mexican Indian, the chicano. </p>
<p>The real question is - who is &#8220;encouraging&#8221; the politicians and law makers to drink the Kool-Aid? </p>

<p>The fact that muslims have the money is a given, however!! the  muslims with the money are the ones sending the ones with NO money to Holland to cause trouble.</p>
