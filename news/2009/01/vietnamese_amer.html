<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-vietart18-2009jan18,0,1933859.story">Vietnamese Americans Protest Art Exhibit in Santa Ana</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louis Sahagun and My-Thuan Tran, Los Angeles Times, January 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of Vietnamese Americans demonstrated Saturday outside a provocative art exhibit in Santa Ana that had featured Communist symbols that protesters claimed mocked their painful experiences as political refugees.</p>
<p>The protest  &mdash;  joined by people bused in from as far away as San Jose  &mdash;  came the day after one of the works was defaced with red paint and the owners of the building ordered the exhibit closed, saying the organizers lacked the proper business license.</p>
<p>Curators of the exhibit, which was commissioned by the Vietnamese American Arts &amp; Letters Assn., said they wanted to launch a discussion about freedom of expression in the Vietnamese community, where talk of communism is a taboo.</p>
<p>A week into the exhibit&rsquo;s run, Jim Nichols, a co-owner of the building at 1600 N. Broadway, acknowledged that he had been pressured by Vietnamese community members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a huge investment in this building and a serious vacancy factor,&#8221; he said of the decision to order the exhibit closed. &#8220;They have factions in their community that go after anyone who in any way seems to put a positive light on communism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the crowd Saturday, a man who unfurled and waved a large flag of Communist Vietnam was immediately surrounded by demonstrators shouting, &#8220;Communist!&#8221; and, &#8220;Go back to Vietnam!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yelling, &#8220;I have rights. I have rights,&#8221; the man was arrested by Santa Ana Police Department officers on suspicion of fighting in public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kathy Phuc Nguyen, a demonstration organizer and spokeswoman for the human rights group Thanh Nien Co Vang, drew cheers when, speaking through a bullhorn, she said, &#8220;Surely, one would not display a photograph of a young Jewish person wearing a Nazi symbol and standing next to a bust of Hitler in a heavily populated community of Holocaust survivors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nguyen was referring to a photograph in the exhibit by Brian Doan, associate professor of art and photography at Long Beach City College, showing a young woman wearing a red tank top with a yellow star  &mdash;  a representation of Vietnam&rsquo;s official flag  &mdash;  and standing beside a small bust of former Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>Doan said in an interview that the photograph had been damaged with red paint, which the exhibit organizers confirmed. He said he intended the work as a commentary on youths in Vietnam who grew up after the Vietnam War. Now, he said, he plans to display it as &#8220;a symbol of my freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tina Dinh, speaking for the demonstrators, called the use of Communist symbols incendiary.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cannot use their freedoms of expression to hurt people with wounds that have not healed,&#8221; she said, noting that for many upset by the exhibit, &#8220;the Vietnam War never ended.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just one more example of why diversity is a definite weakness, as if we needed one after the multicult ideology has us in the midst of an economic collapse that is having a domino effect around the world.</p>
<p>And, as always, most people in this country haven&rsquo;t learned a thing from it, especially, of course, the multicults who deny the sub-prime had anything to do with it all.  We still see them grinning into the camera with a stupified grin on their faces saying the diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>As serious as it is, I just can&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p>

		<p>Liberalim and communism are the terrible offsprings of Marxism.</p>
<p>Now if only Americans in general would protest as vigorously of liberalism as these Vietnamese do with communism.</p>

		<p>At least we have a non-European group in the US who actually appreciates the US and what it stands for.  I jokingly once did a 60&rsquo;s pro-Ho chant to a Vietnamese American (&#8220;Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh, he&rsquo;s gonna struggle, he&rsquo;s gonna win&#8221;) and he jokingly threatened to shoot me in response.</p>
<p>I met a Filipino girl some years ago in Seattle who only wanted to talk about how much she hated the US for the American occupation of the Philippines after the Spanish-American war.  (She didn&rsquo;t want to talk about the Japanese oppression of the Philippines, and I pointed out that was because she was racist against whites, but &#8220;yellow imperialism&#8221; in closer historical proximity was OK with her.)  This isn&rsquo;t to mention practically all of the Chinese I met in Seattle were still loyal to the communist regime there.  (They even protested the Dalai Lama when he spoke at the university.)</p>

		<p>Who can blame the Vietnamese for complaining about the communists? Whites love their communists like William Ayers, their Marxist professors, their Atomic spys, and their trendy Latin Americans like Che. At least the Vietnamese have the gumption to confront the communists instead of slinking away.</p>
<p>Bless them, I say!</p>

		<p>Good for the Vietnamese! Still understandably bitter about the suffering Uncle Ho inflicted on ALL of Indochina!</p>
<p>THEY at least value being in the USA and have little but scorn for the cruel and oppressive Hanoi regime and its distorted history.</p>
<p>A contributor briefly mentions Filipino - Filipina anti-Americanism. Filipino nationalism is a complex and frequently self-contradictory mental construction, best summed up in the pithy slogan:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yankee go home and take me with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m here, let&rsquo;s practice our Spanish:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nosotros Los Gringos Unidos Jamas Seremos Vencidos&#8221;</p>
<p>Can someone set it to music, please? Nine syllables, then &#8216;Jamas&rsquo; then six syllables. Grand opera or flamenco rather than bluegrass, perhaps.</p>
