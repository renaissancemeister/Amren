			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Drogin, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tall and lean, with a wispy mustache and shy smile, 17-year-old Burhan Hassan chalked up A&rsquo;s last fall as a senior at Roosevelt High School, vowing to become a doctor or lawyer.</p>
<p>After school and on weekends, he studied Islam at the nearby Abubakar As-Saddique mosque. He joined its youth group.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to go to Harvard,&#8221; said his uncle Osman Ahmed. &#8220;That was his dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead Hassan has gone to Somalia, the anarchic East African nation that his family fled when he was a toddler. On election day, Hassan and five other youths slipped away from their homes here, and anguished family members now say they may have joined a Taliban-style Islamic militia that U.S. authorities call a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>The youths, who have U.S. passports, followed a well-trod trail from Minneapolis to Mogadishu. Another group took off in August. The FBI believes that over the last two years, 12 to 20 Minnesotans have gone to Somalia.</p>
<p>As a result, a joint terrorism task force led by the FBI is scrambling to determine if extremist Islamic groups are seeking recruits here in the nation&rsquo;s largest Somali community  &mdash;  as well as in San Diego, Seattle, Boston and other cities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It might seem odd to seek a restorative cure in a country that has been mired in war for 18 years and now is known for its pirates. But many Somalis in Minneapolis retain strong political and social ties to the intrigues and battles in their homeland.</p>
<p>&#8220;They each support a particular warlord back in Somalia,&#8221; Omar Jamal, head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center, explained as he puffed on a huge hookah at the crowded Pyramids Cafe and Shisha Lounge.</p>
<p>Somali refugees began flocking to America in the early 1990s when their homeland erupted in famine and civil war  &mdash;  a chaotic bloodletting portrayed in Hollywood&rsquo;s &#8220;Black Hawk Down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Hmong refugees before them, many Somalis moved to Minnesota for good schools, community aid and unskilled jobs in meat-processing plants and factories. A thriving Somali community, estimated at 60,000, has taken root in the state.</p>
<p>The largest group lives in and around a bleak cluster of high-rise apartments beside a busy highway in eastern Minneapolis, an area known as Little Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Women in thick shawls scurry down the icy streets as men in skullcaps pray in storefront mosques and cluster at a local Starbucks. Jobs are scarce and school dropout rates are high. According to police, gangs with names like Somali Mafia and Murda Squad killed seven people last year.</p>
<p>Saeed Fahia, a community activist and local historian, said many youths struggle with alienation in the cultural cross-fire of Somali tradition and American freedom.</p>

			<p>What else could they be going back to Somalia for but terrorism?  Compare the standard of living in Mogadishu and Minneapolis, and they&rsquo;re certainly not going back for the prosperity.  That they have U.S. passports make them all the more worrisome.</p>

			<p>This is part of our government&rsquo;s &#8220;Increase Domestic Terrorism Project.&#8221;  It works like this: Find the most primitive and dysfunctional people you can, preferably with a culture diametrically opposite to that of the USA.  Bring them to the USA and provide a to z social support at taxpayer expense.  Teach them about USA culture and customs and provide them with a USA passport so that they (1) can easily slip in and out of the USA and travel to foreign lands to receive terrorist training.  (2) So they understand American customs enabling them to be successful terrorists.  </p>
<p>Our government   &mdash;   planting the seeds for our own destruction!<br>

<p>These &#8220;people&#8221; are NOT Minnesotans, they are and will always be and always have been, BLACK SOMALI MUSLIMS!!! And they &#8220;Cluster at the local STARBUCKS&#8221;!!! I make more than minimum wage and I cannot afford Starbucks!!! But apparently we taxpaying slaves can afford it for them. Weapons are our friends, get them while we still can.</p>

<p>The perpetual contradiction in the message of egalitarians is always an interesting one. They maintain that everyone is fully equal, intellectually and otherwise. They insist, but without offering any support, that all humans are equally capable of independent thought and responsible actions. Yet, when one of the beneficiaries of their &#8220;stewardship&#8221; exercises a moticum of independent thought, it is immediately suggested that he is not responsible for his actions. Some external force is blamed.</p>
<p>By the way, why do some require &#8220;stewardship&#8221; to begin with, if they are of equal intelligence to their caretakers?</p>
<p>My question to those on the Left is, &#8220;which is it?&#8221; Is everyone intellectually capable of independent thought and responsible actions or not?</p>
<p>Closer to the truth, the facts confirm that the demands of civilization cannot be mastered by people with inheritently low intelligence. This holds true even when the perks of life are gift-wrapped for them, courtesy of taxpayers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FBI believes that over the last two years, 12 to 20 Minnesotans have gone to Somalia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good grief   &mdash;   they were not &#8220;Minnesotans&#8221;. They were Somalis living in Minnesota. They belong in Africa, not civilization. The people responsible for bringing them to Minnesota in the first place should be tried for treason and executed, if convicted.<br>

<p>Well, if the murder rate gets too low to justify high budgets for law enforcement, all the politicos have to do is import some Africans to their communities and it&rsquo;s instant job security again.</p>
<p>I suspect their greatest fear is to guard a community that is all white with almost zero crime, which would mean they might have their numbers cut back severely.  Then they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to eat donuts long enough to collect their pensions, and go to work someplace else, so they would rise to the level of a ceo&rsquo;s income.<br>

<p>The global Somalian diaspora from Finland to Australia are keeping their clan identities intact.  We in the West are just playing the unwitting hosts, as they go about writing the latest chapters in Somali history.  </p>
<p>Thanks to us, they are now able to have bigger families, with reduced infant mortality.  They are raising future armies on behalf of the clans.  The contest for resources will be with each other and with our children.</p>

			<p>This is great news!  Let them all leave the USA and join whatever lunatic fringe groups they want.  They can plot and train all they want, as long as they stay in their rat holes and never return the the USA.  Who cares if the warlords kill each other as long as it&rsquo;s in Somalia?</p>

due to affirmative action he probably has a better chance than a white US veteran</p>

			<p>12 to 29 out of 60,000 is not exactly a drain on the &#8220;youts&#8221; of the Somali community. And why was there a nosque nearby where he could study a stone-age religion and be recruited anyway? Let them go, the more the better, and there will be fewer of them in gangs with names like Somali Mafia and Murda Squad to prey upon Americans.</p>

			<p>How&rsquo;d you like to be a hard-working Starbucks manager, trying to keep afloat in a bad economy, and have a bunch of black Somali males &#8220;cluster&#8221; at your store every day?  </p>

<p><br>
I think a better idea would be to send those responsible for bringing them to the U.S. to Somalia.</p>

			<p>I work at that &#8220;Somali Starbucks&#8221; and they are all really great, well educated people who come in there, and I feel bad for you people who are obviously racist and cannot seem to wrap your head around the fact that they use the little money they have to get a $1.50 cup of coffee to hang out with their friends and have intelligent conversation. Perhaps one day you should just ask them what they all talk about all day there&hellip;.I bet they will tell you, because they are kind people and LOVE to talk about politics. Get a grip, you all came here from somewhere too.</p>
