<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0127/p01s02-usgn.html">As Property Crimes Increase, More Neighbors Are on Patrol</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, January 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for Jennifer Litkowiec to have problems with her husband&rsquo;s off-the-wall ideas, but this one took the cake.</p>
<p>Hispanic gangs had seeped into the couple&rsquo;s quiet corner of the working-class town of Cudahy, Wis., just south of Milwaukee, stealing garage door openers and returning later to score the contents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Against his wife&rsquo;s loud protestations, the young steamfitter joined a dozen other neighborhood men and set up the Rosewood night patrol.</p>
<p>Armed with nothing but flashlights and cellphones, the group followed suspicious cars and even set up an impromptu sting when a neighbor left town and forgot to close his garage door. They called in police to arrest the suspects after a brief chase.</p>
<p>High foreclosure rates, a spike in brazen break-ins, and slashed police budgets are causing turmoil in America&rsquo;s transitioning urban communities, auguring what Atlanta anticrime activist Larry Ely calls an &#8220;urban war.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But like other historical flash points, when the public becomes personally involved in crime fighting, vigilantism becomes a threat, experts say, especially if government appears powerless.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hard numbers on the rise in amateur crime fighters don&rsquo;t exist, but policing experts say the trend is noticeable. At the National Sheriffs Association (NSA), which runs some 26,000 Neighborhood Watch groups, activity has risen to nearly the levels of the winter of 2001, following 9/11.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Rising property crimes a factor</b></p>
<p>Though violent crimes are down across the nation, property crimes by many accounts are rising. (FBI crime figures for 2008 won&rsquo;t be available until fall.) Transitional neighborhoods around major urban centers are particularly prone to the cause-and-effect between rising crime and community patrols, as national migration figures slow and more and more Americans hunker down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Plano, Texas, residents created a watch group to look after vacant and abandoned homes. In New Orleans, groups like Silence is Violence are using Twitter alarms and cell phone messages to fight that city&rsquo;s violent crime wave.</p>
<p>Clayton County, Ga., is one of a growing number of police departments putting arrest and warrant information online in map form to give residents a sense of who has had previous run-ins with the law.</p>
<p>And though Twitter alarms and other tech-savvy warning systems can sometimes ratchet up the perception of crime rates, they&rsquo;re also being used effectively: An Atlanta break-in captured by home cameras and then put up on YouTube helped police catch several suspects last month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Nation magazine recently reported that after hurricane Katrina, vigilantes killed several black men for simply walking through a neighborhood. Several registered sex offenders have also been killed. Citizen patrols became a controversy in New Haven, Conn., in 2007 when the Edgewood Park Defense Patrol included some armed with licensed firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s largely white citizen groups trying to protect new turf, you run the risk of creating flash points,&#8221; says Stan Stojkovic, dean of the Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. {snip}</p>
<p><b>The power of &#8220;Hey!&#8221;</b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Lewis Cartee is careful to address with the more gung-ho members of his block patrol group in East Atlanta, known as Safe Atlanta for Everyone (SAFE). He calls the group &#8220;a glorified neighborhood watch&#8221; where he uses Google maps to chart out &#8220;beats&#8221; for some 40 residents. He says he stresses what he calls &#8220;the power of &#8216;Hey.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Done inclusively, neighborhood patrols can be a powerful deterrent, says Rufus Terrill, an Atlanta mayoral candidate.</p>

			<p>What gets me is the first two paragraphs here that starts with &#8220;The Nation.&#8221;  That thing about Algeirs is just a rumor, thoroughly debunked by all law enforcement in the area.</p>
<p>Also, it seems to me that people associated with things called &#8220;Schools of Social Welfare&#8221; would be perfectly happy with whites being wiped off the face of the earth by non-white criminals, er, I mean, social justice seekers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen New Haven first hand and it is by far the most violent dump in Connecticut. Yale University is a beautiful island surrounded by filthy apartment buildings inhabited by loud, angry people. </p>

<p>Imagine that, Whites standing up when gangs create &#8220;new turf&#8221; in of their neighborhood.  But there will be flash points if gangs of any color begin to operate and cause problems in White neighborhoods, at least the ones with any self-respect left.  </p>
<p>Myself, I am an equal opportunity resident.  When I see something questionable going on, I watch it and am ready to dial 911.  I am also ready to defend myself.  In my state, I have a right to do that.  I wouldn&rsquo;t live in a state that did not recognize that right and neither should you.</p>

			<p>They better arm themselves shotguns and 9mm because if gangs are as brutal as the Hispanic gangs are out here they will need the fire power. The patrols will be moot and pointless if they aren&rsquo;t armed because your opponents will have very high fire power.</p>

<p>This too would be moot if the shooter cannot aim!! I have seen entire areas sprayed with automatic gunfire in Viet-Nam, South America, Los Angeles and Baghdad with no one killed!! I have also seen one shot, one kill, this is the path we need to take. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Armed with nothing but flashlights and cellphones&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember people doing this back in the day here in the southwest. Always seems like a good idea at the time. Then it gets old when it doesn&rsquo;t work and it becomes dangerous. The cops eventually stop cooperating and finally request you stop doing it.</p>
<p>The cops get tired (whiney) about how you can&rsquo;t call the police everytime you see a brown person. They then start to respond slower and slower.</p>
<p>Chances are, by now, if you&rsquo;re having a mexican problem, it&rsquo;s too late. Your town&rsquo;s problem is already mostly complete. Your apartment complexes are most likely totally overun. Forcing more whites to flee further and further away. These whites might have been poor as well, but at least white crime level per capita of whites is relatively low. More controllable as well. I&rsquo;m poor and I&rsquo;m not of welfare. Yet I don&rsquo;t break the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;vigilantism&#8221;</p>
<p> While traditionaly this method has worked in the past, it&rsquo;s starting to become very risky. Liberals would love nothing more than to anger you to the point that you get yourself thrown in prison. Mexicans are learning this as well. Tick off whites just enough and cause one to &#8220;loose&#8221; it in the name of &#8220;hate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Vigilantism requires a whole lot of participants. You really need a mob. And I mean one that isn&rsquo;t going to cower away when the cops show up. This is harder than it sounds. Especially from homeowners. They&rsquo;ll always tell you they have more to lose.</p>
<p>Neighborhood watches always seem fun for the moment. I live in a larger city where there used to be hundreds of them back in the late eighties. Then 8 years of Clintonism happened. Crime culture was embraced and soon everyone wanted to be thug. And unfortunately one made a better thug if you were black or brown. And since out in suburbia chances are you weren&rsquo;t either of these colors, you only had to pretend. It became&hellip;acceptable.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;High foreclosure rates&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals who write many of these columns like to place blame on the economy like it&rsquo;s some magic entity. Browns and their like were destroying neighborhoods way before the oil companies and the banks decided to play games with our money.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;give residents a sense of who has had previous run-ins with the law&#8221;</p>
<p> Because cops are lazy. It&rsquo;s inherent. Remember, they&rsquo;re city employees who get paid whether they do a good job or not. Whether they actually catch any criminals. Like most civil service jobs, it takes litteraly an act of God to get fired. Unless you violate someone&rsquo;s civil rights. Very hard to prove, unless you&rsquo;re a minority. So it&rsquo;s easier to do nothing and simply tell the citizens to look at pictures on the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the power of &#8220;HEY&#8221;&hellip;the power of &#8220;BOOM&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yeah, yelling at strange minorities in the dark in the middle of the night. Only liberals think this garbage up. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until someone shoots at you for interfering with their crime. Where I live, we&rsquo;re allowed to shoot back, but the police still don&rsquo;t like it. Here, the police are very meek, cowardly and defeatist. But the criminals know we&rsquo;re armed. So it tends to keep them at a safe distance.</p>
<p>Remember, the cops just as soon arrest you instead of the criminal. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to them. They get paid either way. You&rsquo;ll convict just as easy. If not easier.</p>
<p>Just to hear of such an article as above in this day and age of the black osamian cult is an insult. It borders a smack in the face. With minority crime and it&rsquo;s black president now legitimized as a national pastime, they want to fluster whites even more. So by all means, run out and get a neighboorhood watch poster for your window. By a little flashlight and take your dog for a walk at 11:00pm. That&rsquo;ll show &#8216;em&hellip;why, you&rsquo;re now a regular Wyatt Earp!</p>
<p>Just remember though, the eighties are over.</p>
<p>The main crux of this article is property crime. Exactly that. Ever heard a cop&rsquo;s take on &#8220;property crimes&#8221;? They&rsquo;re not assaults, they&rsquo;re not shootings and no one is in immediate danger. They&rsquo;re just property crimes for crying out loud. Why make it worse? Stay at home, lock your doors and hope everything&rsquo;s where it was when you went to bed.</p>
<p>If you wake up in the moring and your toolbox is missing from your garage&hellip;ready?&hellip;&#8221;it&rsquo;s not the crime of the century!&#8221;</p>
<p>They LOVE to say this. This is their attitude about everything. And now, we want to call them when we see a suspicious brown person. I want to take back the streets just as much as the next person. In fact, even more. Of course, my way wouldn&rsquo;t be for everyone. Anyways, This is the trend concerning the evolution of the Neighborhood Watch as I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become nothing more than a &#8220;pat yourself on the back&#8221; feel good measure&hellip;it needs to be updated. There are ways&hellip;</p>

<p>Because by G-d, we can&rsquo;t have White people coming out of their homes/cells, getting to know their neighbors, and forming real <i>communities</i>. GASP! That would be bad! And by the way, they&rsquo;re protecting OLD turf.</p>

			<p>That garbage from The Nation about those guys in Algeirs isn&rsquo;t half as harmful as that You Tube video about them.  Since then they&rsquo;ve been receiving all manner of death threats, rocks thrown through windows, and general harassment.  There is no evidence, but an accusation is all that is needed.  Never mind that the blacks were violently looting, destroying, raping, etc. during the aftermath of Katrina; that&rsquo;s hardly any reason for whites to get together and defend themselves.  It makes me sick.</p>
<p>On a better note, I see some signs of hope.  I&rsquo;m not on that Twitter network, but if I have to work late I can text message local guys on and around my block and one of them will come outside to make sure I don&rsquo;t have to make it from my car to my front porch alone.  Sad that it&rsquo;s come to this, but good that there are plenty of decent armed white men that have volunteered to help protect women coming home alone at night.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Transitional neighborhoods&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what they call ethnic cleansing now, &#8216;transition&rsquo;. Actually, it&rsquo;s surprising they didn&rsquo;t use a positive word there to describe it, or a word meant to intimidate, instead of a neutral word like &#8216;transition&rsquo;. The media is really slipping up.  </p>

			<p>WTH is a &#8220;transitional neighborhood?&#8221; That is the first time I have ever heard that phrase and they are bantering it about like it&rsquo;s a normal thing to say. In the context of this article, a transitional neighborhood does not sound like a very good thing. Recall that death is often euphemized as a transition too, as is menopause. </p>

			<p>I thoroghly agree with WTFHappened above.  There are lots of good cops, but police administration is solidly liberal.</p>
<p>In the simple mind of the police administrator, there are only two kinds of people:  Criminals and Victims.  If you arm yourself to keep from becoming a Victim, then you are a Criminal.  Remember Bernard Goetz.</p>
<p>&#8220;When seconds count, the police are only minutes away&#8221;<br>

<p>&gt; I don&rsquo;t know if YOU have ever been burglarized this way, but I have - twice while still living in California.  It may  not be the crime of the century, but the feeling of violation is huge and it becomes a neurosis when it repeats.  The bottom line is that when a stranger demonstrates that they can enter your home while you are there or not, your life is in danger.  Murder of a nobody is not the crime of the century the way say the assassination of a state head would be, but if you are the victim, it is the crime of your life.  Therefore, a smart individual doesn&rsquo;t tolerate the least bit of crime in as large an enviroment as one can influence.</p>

<p>This is true. The MSM reports murders of famous or influential people and this keeps statistics low. I personally knew of a number of murders committed in Cali. that were never investigated, only the body picked up as a matter of routine. This sort of crime is so rampant that no police or investigating agency cares to tie up all of it&rsquo;s assets to look into them, even though to do so would lead to the perpetrators of more than just the crime being investigated and usually illegals!! </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on, Reader.</p>
<p>This present &#8220;Watchgroup&#8221; is nothing less than a civil defense force, unarmed for the moment, but that is certain to change as the situation deteriorates.  </p>
<p>In the &#8216;92 riots we witnessed Korean businessmen forming a defensive group against blacks, taking to their rooftops and firing at looters below in order to protect their property and their people.  For all intents and purposes this was an example of low intensity warfare, and the combatants were divided along lines of race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>In the above neighborhood watch group, against what are most certainly non-whites, we&rsquo;re seeing the populace forming their own brand of military groups, and in effect, this is the first stage of more intense action. </p>
<p>As Reader points out, we will be witnesses to identical kinds of situations from this point forward.  Eventually, they&rsquo;ll be commonplace and &#8220;guarding&#8221; one&rsquo;s neighborhood will be a fact of life.  </p>
<p>Anybody care to guess what will follow this situation?<br>

<p>Skip, are you trying to tell us that you have seen ground action in both Viet Nam (fighting ended in 1974) and Baghdad? Baghdad saw ground fighting only in the current (second) Iraq war which started in 2003. I can&rsquo;t figure out how this is possible.</p>

			<p>To WTFHappened1776,</p>
<p>I can only assume that you&rsquo;ve had some unfortunate run-ins with miserable cops. Affirmative action has indeed turned many big-city / metropolitan agencies into uniformed welfare, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that those agencies are riddled with undeserving, unmotivated officers. </p>
<p>However, not every cop is that way. Some cops still do get frustrated that a tax-paying citizen has been victimized by yet another undeserving, tax-using oxygen thief. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, except for you and the few others who share your beliefs, the only citizens that town councils hear from are the liberals and the tax-spenders. This tends to drive police leadership towards &#8220;caretaker&#8221; or &#8220;social worker&#8221; functions that benefit the criminal over the citizen.</p>
<p>Citizens need to ask their lawmakers why police departments are hiring 5-foot tall, hundred pound females. Why is a morbidly obese officer still working the road? Why are cops running youth centers instead of rolling through your neighborhood at 2 am looking for burglars and car thieves? Why are police departments investing so heavily in less-lethal technology while criminals are only getting more deadly? </p>
<p>Police chiefs and police commissioners tend to be heel-rocking, pocket change-jingling, pinstriped elitists who haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea of what it&rsquo;s like to work the road. They don&rsquo;t have a clue what ordinary citizens expect from the officers that serve them.</p>
<p>Why not tell your local police chief not to try &#8220;impressing&#8221; you by hiring the tiniest, sassiest, mouthiest, single-mother-of-four minority female candidate who&rsquo;s really only looking for a steady paycheck with benefits? </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but not every cop is a loser. </p>

			<p>Well, these patrols by whites are evidence that the population might be aware that the danger facing them is getting worse, although I doubt that those in this story formed strictly as a racial, non-white watchdog force.  They&rsquo;re organized against criminals; however, how long is it going to take them to understand that they will be targets soon because of their race?  My guess is not long as the situation continues to intensify.  But I doubt they will verbalize the threat facing them for fear of being called racist.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t read or hear of a high profile white American complain about crime as coming almost exclusively from non-whites, because those in this country are too intimidated and fearful to do that.  Even most of the rank and file are reluctant to tell it like it is.</p>
<p>But, like everything else about this horrendous multicultural mess, it takes a Russian to have the cajones to point out what others here are too spineless to mention.  It was the Russian professor Panarin who forecast break up and conflict along racial lines, although most of the elites on the right no doubt hold similar views, but are absolutely terrified to say so or write anything about it.  </p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s another high level Russian, the ambassador to the UN, who is telling us that white nations need white unity or they will be overrun:</p>
<p>https://www.russiatoday.com/guests/detail/1801</p>
<p>&#8220;Russian ambassador to NATO makes plea for white unity&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an enormous distance between Europe and the Third World. There is a new civilization emerging in the Third World that thinks that the white, northern hemisphere has always oppressed it and must therefore fall at its feet now. This is very serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the northern civilization wants to protect itself, it must be united: America, the European Union, and Russia. If they are not together, they will be defeated one by one.&#8221;</p>
<p>And part of the defeat of white nations is the addition of third world rabble who flee to white shores, engage in crime and fill their prisons and clog up the court systems.</p>
<p>As the economy worsens, more neighborhood watch groups will be forming just like the ones this news story describes.  The question that might be asked right now is how long is it going to take for whites in America to reach the level of courage of the two Russian gentlemen to point out something so obvious it can&rsquo;t be ignored?</p>
<p>The blood of our forefaters still flow within our veins, but we don&rsquo;t have a fraction of the courage they did.</p>

<p>Truer words were never spoken.  Sooner, probably than later, whites will have to find courage if they love their families and wish to survive.  Furthermore, they have to acknowledge the racial dimensions of this problem and of this struggle.  Forget about trying to forge a rainbow coalition with the &#8220;good&#8221; non-whites.   </p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics can be remorseless killers, especially if the victim is white.  Any white neighborhood watchmen should be armed and be prepared to use force if things get out of hand.  </p>

<p>What you say is very true. I suggest the book CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE. It expands a great deal on what you say. In general the &#8220;modern&#8221;, &#8220;liberal&#8221;, &#8220;inclusive&#8221; ideas about urban areas are all wrong. You want your neighbourhood to be restricted only to people who live there.</p>

Good Post;<br>

			<p>I find it when I am being mau maued and am all alone like these people who are singled out by the media, it is best to use the language of the Left against the left.  I wouldn&rsquo;t call it neighborhood watch I would call it a neighborhood tolerance committee making sure that tolerance and peace are being distributed equally.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;In the &lsquo;92 riots we witnessed Korean businessmen forming a defensive group against blacks, taking to their rooftops and firing at looters below in order to protect their property and their people. For all intents and purposes this was an example of low intensity warfare, and the combatants were divided along lines of race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>In the above neighborhood watch group, against what are most certainly non-whites, we&rsquo;re seeing the populace forming their own brand of military groups, and in effect, this is the first stage of more intense action.</p>
<p>As Reader points out, we will be witnesses to identical kinds of situations from this point forward. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll be commonplace and &ldquo;guarding&rdquo; one&rsquo;s neighborhood will be a fact of life.</p>
<p>Anybody care to guess what will follow this situation?</p>

<p>Sounds like the Koreans showed us that the government no longer has a credible monopoly on the use of force&hellip;one of the first signs of a breakup into ethnic enclaves.</p>
