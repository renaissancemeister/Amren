<h1><a href="https://www.farmersguardian.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=23882">Harvest Fears As Recession Forces Migrant Workers Home</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CROPS could be left to rot in the fields this summer as migrant workers leave the UK in their droves over fears for the country&rsquo;s faltering economy, the Local Government Association (LGA) has warned.</p>
<p>New research from the LGA identifies farming as one of the hardest hit industries as a result of new restrictions on non-EU workers and the possibility of migrant workers leaving the country.</p>
<p>Councillor Margaret Eaton, chairman of the LGA, said: &#8220;If migrant workers begin to return home in large numbers, it could put real strain on some of the key services and industries we all take for granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This report is a stark reminder that councils and businesses across the country need to be alert to any changes in their local workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farmers are already saying they&rsquo;ve lost money because they can&rsquo;t fill jobs. If seasonal migrant workers can&rsquo;t be recruited, this will only get worse and losses could be passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unharvested food will go to waste and food will need to be shipped in from abroad, both of which will damage the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Council leaders will today (Wednesday, January 21) put forward a three point plan to ensure that the businesses most likely to be affected can cope.</p>
<p>The plan will see local councils lead the way, bringing together local businesses, the Learning and Skills Council and Job Centre Plus to help identify what skills are needed and set up training programmes to make up any skills gap.</p>
<p>It will also call on the Home Office to review the situation and will advise councils to keep a close eye on local populations to identify early any signs of a mass exodus.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Farmers are already saying they&rsquo;ve lost money&#8221;</p>
<p>So what. Do they rather want to lose their country?</p>

<p>Unharvested food will return value to the soil, and there will be many unemployed Britons to harvest their Victory Gardens.</p>

<p>American farmers have been claiming the same thing for the last 50 years.  Somehow enough illegals always manage to sneak through to harvest the crops.</p>
<p>When times are good, Farmers lobby for more migrants because their workforce leaves for easier better paid jobs.  When times are bad farmers still lobby for more migrants.</p>

<p>In many articles they write that they&rsquo;re losing a record number of jobs and they expect the jobless rate to drop to depression levels.  Of course those stories are probably true, because we&rsquo;re seeing it happen world-wide with rioting in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Then up pops this story whining that they don&rsquo;t have enough workers, wringing their hands about not being able to get more.</p>
<p>Methinks the multicults could be responsible for this above con job, because only they would be calling for more people when their society is collapsing around them, hoping to keep their multicultural dreams alive no matter how many jobs there really are.</p>

			<p>State admits busy signals on unemployment hotline still a big problem (WI)<br>
Friday, January 23, 2009 5:03:44 PM · by Lorianne · 3 replies <br>
WKOW ^ | Jan 23, 2009 | Dan Cassuto<br>
As if getting laid off wasn&rsquo;t enough, unemployed residents in Wisconsin must now face a second punch in the gut: busy signals. The state&rsquo;s unemployment hotline is overloaded with callers trying to sign up for benefits or speak to specialists about their claims. The huge influx of calls due to the poor economy left the state&rsquo;s phone system unable to handle the volume. There simply aren&rsquo;t enough state workers to answer. Many viewers report endless busy signals and hold times of 40 minutes. That leaves them unable to start receiving their checks. &#8220;</p>
<p>In other news, the Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce, Farmers Alliance, Restaurant &amp; Hotel Owners Association, and other employers are clamoring for immediate legalization of illegals and open borders because there are no unemployed Americans looking for jobs in Wisconsin</p>

			<p>The economically illiterate and the scaremongers insist on the nonsense of &#8216;crops rotting in the fields&rsquo;.<br>
As anyone with even the most cursory acquaintance of classical economic theory will tell you this is nonsense upon stilts.<br>
 No farmer worth his salt would ever consider sowing a &#8216;dead loss&rsquo; into the ground - it would destroy him financially, and therefore would pay a full market rate for the labor needed to harvest his crops.<br>
The market rate for farm labor is written into the price of the harvested vegetables in a dynamic feedback mechanism, therefore the bogeyman of &#8216;no labor to pick the crops&rsquo; is merechildish nonsense that any educated person should be ashamed to utter.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s something called the &#8220;free market.&#8221; Capitalists love it when the &#8220;free market&#8221; puts more money in their pockets via higher prices for real estate, oil, whatever. They hate it when it takes money out of their pocket via higher prices for labor. God forbid that should happen.</p>

			<p>Sir Galahad rides to the rescue! There is a top secret solution to the problem and I will now reveal it. Sifting through hidden government documents and the fine print of such obscure British publications such as the London Times, Guardian, Daily Mail I have discovered this  amazing fact: Unemployment is Great Britain is expected to hit 2 million this year.</p>

			<p>Well, if Walmart,Tesco, Sainbury&rsquo;s, etc., paid more to the farmers and took less profit perhaps the farmers could afford to pay higher wages and attract more indigenous workers who don&rsquo;t live 20 to an apartment and live on pot noodles and cheap vodka.<br>
I thought that the sweat shop was a third world phenomenon&hellip;.perhaps I was wrong.<br>

			<p>The indigeneous British have harvested food on their island for milleniums. The idea that all of a sudden the harvest depends on foreign labour just doesn&rsquo;t fly. This sounds to me like more Labour party propaganda.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Farmers are already saying they&rsquo;ve lost money&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So what. Do they rather want to lose their country?</p>
<p>This may come as a newsflash to some, but greed seems to trump racial and cultural concerns. </p>
<p>We are told that Whites demand too much compensation for our work and we demand working conditions that are unreasonably high.</p>
<p>I think life would be much better without unions and government intervention. An employer should be allowed to define compensation and working conditions. As employees, we have a right to accept those conditions or choose to work elsewhere.</p>
