<h1>Senate Call for Slavery Apology Meets Unlikely Foe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Douglas, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), June 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Senate passed a resolution on Thursday calling on the United States to apologize officially for the enslavement and segregation of millions of blacks and to acknowledge &#8220;the fundamental injustice, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, passed on a voice vote. It now moves to the House, where it may meet an unlikely foe: members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>Several caucus members expressed concerns about a disclaimer that states that &#8220;nothing in this resolution authorizes or supports any claim against the United States; or serves as a settlement of any claim against the United States.&#8221; Those caucus members say the disclaimer is an attempt to stave off reparations claims from the descendants of slaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting in a disclaimer takes away from the meaning of an apology,&#8221; said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.</p>
<p>Thompson noted that a 1988 apology that the government issued to Japanese-Americans held in U.S. camps during World War II had no disclaimer and didn&rsquo;t prevent them from receiving compensation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The language is unacceptable,&#8221; said Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., &#8220;I&rsquo;m a reparations man  &mdash;  how else do you repair the damage?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., the Senate&rsquo;s lone black, went to the floor after the Harkin resolution passed and said, &#8220;I want to go on record making sure that that disclaimer in no way would eliminate future actions that may be brought before this body that may deal with reparations.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Not a slam-dunk</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., who&rsquo;s shepherding the Harkin resolution in the House, sponsored a slavery apology bill that excluded a disclaimer and passed in that chamber last year. He described the scheduled Rotunda event as &#8220;an understanding, a beginning of a dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>But instead of making preparations for the event, Cohen found himself Thursday trying to convince Congressional Black Caucus members that the disclaimer is simply ultra-careful legalese that senators insisted upon and doesn&rsquo;t affect the drive for reparations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Forceful language</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A wrong of segregation was done by the federal government of the United States of America, and we acknowledge that,&#8221; said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a co-sponsor of the resolution. &#8220;We say it was wrong, and we ask forgiveness for that.&#8221;</p>

1st Session<br>
S. CON. RES. 26</p>
<p>Apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of African-Americans.</p>
<p>IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES<br>
June 11, 2009</p>
<p>Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. BROWNBACK, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. LAUTENBERG, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. BOND, and Mr. COCHRAN) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was ordered held at the desk</p>
<p>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</p>
<p>Apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of African-Americans.</p>
<p>Whereas, during the history of the Nation, the United States has grown into a symbol of democracy and freedom around the world;</p>
<p>Whereas the legacy of African-Americans is interwoven with the very fabric of the democracy and freedom of the United States;</p>
<p>Whereas millions of Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States and the 13 American colonies from 1619 through 1865;</p>
<p>Whereas Africans forced into slavery were brutalized, humiliated, dehumanized, and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage;</p>
<p>Whereas many enslaved families were torn apart after family members were sold separately;</p>
<p>Whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism against people of African descent upon which it depended became enmeshed in the social fabric of the United States;</p>
<p>Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the ratification of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States in 1865, after the end of the Civil War;</p>
<p>Whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery, African-Americans soon saw the fleeting political, social, and economic gains they made during Reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism, lynchings, disenfranchisement, Black Codes, and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life;</p>
<p>Whereas the system of de jure racial segregation known as &#8216;Jim Crow&rsquo;, which arose in certain parts of the United States after the Civil War to create separate and unequal societies for Whites and African-Americans, was a direct result of the racism against people of African descent that was engendered by slavery;</p>
<p>Whereas the system of Jim Crow laws officially existed until the 1960s  &mdash;  a century after the official end of slavery in the United States  &mdash;  until Congress took action to end it, but the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day;</p>
<p>Whereas African-Americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and Jim Crow laws  &mdash;  long after both systems were formally abolished  &mdash;  through enormous damage and loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of human dignity and liberty;</p>
<p>Whereas the story of the enslavement and de jure segregation of African-Americans and the dehumanizing atrocities committed against them should not be purged from or minimized in the telling of the history of the United States;</p>
<p>Whereas those African-Americans who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws, and their descendants, exemplify the strength of the human character and provide a model of courage, commitment, and perseverance;</p>
<p>Whereas, on July 8, 2003, during a trip to Goree Island, Senegal, a former slave port, President George W. Bush acknowledged the continuing legacy of slavery in life in the United States and the need to confront that legacy, when he stated that slavery &#8216;was &hellip; one of the greatest crimes of history &hellip; The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destiny is set: liberty and justice for all.&rsquo;;</p>
<p>Whereas President Bill Clinton also acknowledged the deep-seated problems caused by the continuing legacy of racism against African-Americans that began with slavery, when he initiated a national dialogue about race;</p>
<p>Whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past, but confession of the wrongs committed and a formal apology to African-Americans will help bind the wounds of the Nation that are rooted in slavery and can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help the people of the United States understand the past and honor the history of all people of the United States;</p>
<p>Whereas the legislatures of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the States of Alabama, Florida, Maryland, and North Carolina have taken the lead in adopting resolutions officially expressing appropriate remorse for slavery, and other State legislatures are considering similar resolutions; and</p>
<p>Whereas it is important for the people of the United States, who legally recognized slavery through the Constitution and the laws of the United States, to make a formal apology for slavery and for its successor, Jim Crow, so they can move forward and seek reconciliation, justice, and harmony for all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the sense of the Congress is the following:</p>
<p>(1) APOLOGY FOR THE ENSLAVEMENT AND SEGREGATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS- The Congress  &mdash;  </p>
<p>(A) acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws;</p>
<p>(B) apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws; and</p>
<p>(C) expresses its recommitment to the principle that all people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on all people of the United States to work toward eliminating racial prejudices, injustices, and discrimination from our society.</p>
<p>(2) DISCLAIMER- Nothing in this resolution  &mdash;  </p>
<p>(A) authorizes or supports any claim against the United States; or</p>
<p>(B) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United States.</p>

<i>&ldquo;Putting in a disclaimer takes away from the meaning of an apology,&rdquo; said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.</i></p>
<p>We all know this is about money. &#8216;Sorry&rsquo; was never the issue. This is standard &#8216;foot in the door&rsquo; activism.</p>
<p>First they say, &#8216;all we want is an apology&rsquo;. So most people say, &#8216;that sounds reasonable enough&rsquo; and agree. But once they have the apology, the door gets pushed open even further.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before I&rsquo;m not necessarily against reparations if I believed it would end with a one-time-only payout. After all, it would amount to a stimulus package. Blacks would quickly spend the money and it would be back in circulation. But as with the black farmers payout, once is never enough and since many blacks would foolishly squander this windfall, they would be demanding more money because they would complain the payout was unfair or handled badly.</p>
<p>I suspect reparation legislation will be passed. The only questions are when, how much, how many times the payouts are going to be made, and in what never-ending forms.<br>

<p>Who is this &#8220;WE&#8221; he keeps mentioning? He and his friends? his family? white Americans? I know it&rsquo;s not me. Nobody can apologize for the actions of another person. This is getting to be well beyond absurd! There is one thing about most blacks and that is, they will never be satisfied. EVER!</p>

		<p>Of course they want MONEY!  This was never about an &#8220;apology&#8221; to begin with. They could care less about what the White man says, all they care about is getting the White man&rsquo;s money for nothing. Hasn&rsquo;t the White man paid enough for these people being allowed to stay in this country? They will NEVER be satisfied, period! They will milk the White man forever and the lemming Whites will hand it over. </p>

		<p>Can someone please tell me the difference between slavery and the draft? Unless of course one realizes the the draft quite often results in death and that would equate to state murder. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for my reparations when I and many others were refused employment at the new U.S.A-U.A.W. Socialist Motors (Old G.M) because of our white skin.</p>

		<p>Blacks need to get power, position and money any crooked way they can, because they just can&rsquo;t obtain any of the three on their own.  They&rsquo;ve been given numerous privileges, but they still can&rsquo;t perform adequately as a people.</p>
<p>In addition to giving them them what everybody else has to earn, they require that we all pretend that they are where they are, because of their own efforts.  They applaud their co-ethnics when they are given positions as a part of AA as if they were capable enough to have obtained positions because of their intelligence and hard work.</p>
<p>There will be no end to it all, because it just isn&rsquo;t possible to placate people who don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to recognize assistance when they get it.  Instead they FIRMLY believe that there are rocket scientists, CEO&rsquo;s, presidents, great writers, gifted intellects, rife within their ranks and the reason they aren&rsquo;t recognized for their talents is because the white man is keeping them down.  Believe me, they don&rsquo;t think there is such a thing as affirmative action.  They believe AA is just a procedure whereby the white man removes his foot from the neck of a few blacks so they can excel.</p>
<p>If you point to the fact that every black nation on earth is a failure as well as its natives, including the ones who fled to other countries, they will either deny that to be the case or blame their failures on whites.</p>

		<p>Slavery (although abhorrent) benefited those who were sold by their own people and brought to the USA.<br>
alex haley&rsquo;s &#8220;roots&#8221; series did a great disservice by the outright lies and misperceptions that were presented.<br>
It is FACT that the slaves were sold by their own kind.  Europeans DID NOT capture them; tribal leaders (and local tribal conquerors) made &#8220;deals&#8221; with the slave traders.<br>
A educated black professor who gives tours at the african embarkation points notes that American blacks are truly &#8220;shocked&#8221; to find out that they were pressed into slavery by their own kind.<br>
The movie &#8220;amistad&#8221; leaves out an important point about &#8220;cinque&#8221;, one of the slaves that won his freedom after a rebellion aboard ship. <br>
&#8220;cinque&#8221; made numerous trips back to africa as a slave trader to acquire slaves and was quite successful at it.<br>
There is an article in a back issue of &#8220;American Heritage&#8221; magazine called &#8220;Selling Poor Steven&#8221; which chronicles the portion of the slave trade being run by blacks.  It also makes one aware of the extent of the black slaveowner society that existed at the time.  Slavery was a human condition that sometimes made no account of race.  &#8220;Indentured servants&#8221; who were white were quite often treated more harshly and given more dangerous jobs than slaves because the terms of their contracts were limited.  Many of them did not live to see the end of their terms.</p>

		<p>Does everyone notice how the &#8220;reparations&#8221; paradigm is of Blacks being oppressed, victimized, and worthy of tons of money and resources to make them whole?</p>
<p>Blacks have benefitted tremendously because of White people. If anyone has suffered, it is White people having to live in proximety with Blacks. Imagine how much lower our taxes would be if we didn&rsquo;t have to support 15 percent of the population that has an 80% out of wedlock birth rate, high welfare usage, high crime committing, average 85 IQ population.</p>
<p>It really is Blacks who owe Whites reparations. Common sense bears it out.</p>

		<p>Terese:</p>
<p>Supporters of the Great Society, when it was being proposed, said that one of the reasons we needed to pass it is to give blacks reparations for slavery.  And that they have   &mdash;   to the tune of probably $7 trillion by now.  A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon it starts adding up to real money.</p>
<p>But these are the kinds of &#8220;reparations&#8221; that the black elite don&rsquo;t want.  They say that average blacks should not get reparations money because, in their own words, slavery was so horrible that the average black would be so traumatized and experience PTSD style flashbacks, just upon seeing the check on his or her hands, that s/he will lash out by wasting the money on bling.  Instead, CBC/NAACP want reparations for black &#8220;nation building,&#8221; i.e. a golden honey pot sinecure for black kook pseudo-intellectuals like Cornell West.</p>

		<p> Nothing shows how clearly that the Senate has lost its collective mind than the fact that this resolution, pregnant with potential consequences for this country, none of them good, sailed right on through on a voice vote. Was this a clever move to ensure that no one would have to actually cast a traceable, recorded vote on this measure? Or did it actually show that the Senate believes it was so obviously a good thing that it was believed no real vote was necessary?</p>
<p> Won&rsquo;t it be ironic   &mdash;   and poetic justice   &mdash;   if this wrongheaded resolution is derailed in the House by the very blacks it is targeted to &#8220;help&#8221;? By the way, I thought the choice of the phrase &#8220;slam dunk,&#8221; considering how the blacks have completely taken over the NBA in recent years, was grimly humorous and appropriate.</p>

		<p>Show me a slave and his former master (most former slave masters are the ancestors of todays liberals), and I&rsquo;ll make sure the master gives reparations. But I am a white casualty of affirmitive action. The Black Caucus can look elsewhere for their extortion racket.</p>

		<p>The economist Walter Williams has it so right, he has issued a blanket amnesty to all White people in this country for all grievances, real or imagined. This he says is done to stop White people from always making such damm fools of themselves in constantly grovelling and apologizing for things that none of them anything to do with. There is not a  black person alive today that was ever a slave in this country. But we are always told that the descendent&rsquo;s of the slave&rsquo;s are owed an apology and reparation&rsquo;s. By this logic there must be hundred&rsquo;s of million&rsquo;s of descendants of Greek, Roman, and Arab slavery alive today through out the world who are also owed something.</p>

Seriously,I am all for reparations. Give them each a big chunk of change. I have seen some numbers bantered around for reparations. $150,000 per person stands out a lot. </p>
<p>Why do I want to see payments made? Because I have a really morbid sense of curiosity. Could you imagine each black getting $150,000, and what social implications would ensue? </p>
<p>A whole slew of arguments about Afro-American culture would be unavoidably settled. If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Plus what does it matter that the government throws out a few billion more. The dollar is already toast. The victory would be short lived.</p>

There is an article in a back issue of &ldquo;American Heritage&rdquo; magazine called &ldquo;Selling Poor Steven&rdquo; which chronicles the portion of the slave trade being run by blacks. It also makes one aware of the extent of the black slaveowner society that existed at the time. Slavery was a human condition that sometimes made no account of race. &ldquo;Indentured servants&rdquo; who were white were quite often treated more harshly and given more dangerous jobs than slaves because the terms of their contracts were limited. Many of them did not live to see the end of their terms.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Most Blacks DO know that Blacks were sold to European slave traders by other Black Africans and Arabs. No race has a monopoly on greed. White traders going to the grasslands to trap slaves only accounted for less than 5% of the enslaved population. But what difference does it make anyway? Whites have enslaved other Whites, and Native Americans have been enslaved as well.</p>

   &mdash;    Another point (that was not made) about Cinque was that he was returned to Africa  by a public subscription taken in New England.   When he got there, he found that his entire village and family had been wiped out by inter-tribal warfare.      Thus, he was actually spared their fate by being taken to Cuba as a slave.  For him, slavery in the New World  had proven to be a blessing in disguise.  </p>

		<p>If blacks get reparations, will it be alright for companies, or different organizations to be able to place liens on their checks? I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;ll have to be addressed once the idea of reparations is okayed. I wonder just how many blacks in this country have walked away from contrctural responsibilities?</p>

		<p> If it wasn&rsquo;t for white people these blacks would be in Africa swatting flies off their faces and running from lions. These people receive zillions of dollars in the form of welfare over the years. These truly are ungrateful people. The only ones suffering are whites whose inner city neighborhoods have been destroyed by these people.</p>

		<p>The Black Congressional caucus is the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that minority status for Native Born White Americans means the ned to affirmtive action is delusional. On the contrary, if and when Native Born White Amerians are reduced to an dwindling minority within the borders of America, affirmative aciton will be forced on them and their will be nothing you can do about it. Post-1965 non-whites will control the military,police departments and the legal system.</p>
<p>Reparations will very likely be the match thrown ino the basement full of gasoline. Reparations among other things will mean free college education and free health care for blacks and later on hispancs and asians. Native Born White Americans-most of whom live a few pay checks from the street-in addition to not recieving free college education and free health care, will be forced to subsidize the free college and free health of blacks and eventually other groups pushing for reparations. Without  a doubt Native Born White Americans will be made worse off. </p>
<p>In the theory of Social Welfare econmics reparations will violate the principle of Pareto Optimality. It is just horrible social welfare policy.</p>
<p>But on the most fundamental level, reparations is just another exmple of the vicious race war that is being waged against Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>This is good news.  The more open the dispute, the more people will see what the score is.  The Congressional Black Caucus has just put the lie to that little disclaimer attached to the Senate&rsquo;s apology.  They&rsquo;re too dumb and short sighted to realize that the courts would have given them reparations anyway, disregarding the disclaimer.  As always, a dollar RIGHT NOW instead of five dollars next week.  We were right and they were wrong.  That&rsquo;s always a good position to be in.  </p>

		<p>More ritual racist white-bashing.  It really isn&rsquo;t about slavery or reparations, it&rsquo;s a method of those in power to force their subjects to symbolically and publicly bow down to their masters and acknowledge their subservience.   Meanwhile &hellip; over the last 50 years or so, we have seen a pandemic of racist rape and murder against whites and the remarkable ethnic cleansing of virtually every major American city,  all overseen by the same Congress that is issuing this proclamation.   You wouldn&rsquo;t know there was one white lynching or rape victim during that period by perusing the Congressional records.   The Senators aren&rsquo;t responsible for slavery that happened long before they were born,  but they are morally and legally  responsible for the fact that a few blocks from where they issued this proclamation no white person can walk in safety,  a real civil rights violation they have the power to do something about but decline to do,  indeed decline to even mention.</p>

		<p>Reparations for black slavery?  Then why not pay reparations to poor whites living in Appalachia and in the South, because their ancestors where often kidnapped from England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and on the European mainland to become so-called &#8220;indentured servants&#8221;?</p>
<p>I have not read this book myself, but I have heard that a good book about whites in slavery is &#8220;White Cargo.&#8221;  Perhaps, if anyone else, reading this post,is more knowledgble about white enslavement in American history, they can reply with another post.</p>
<p>I did read the 1974 book &#8220;The Good Old Days-They were Terrible!&#8221; and this I can back up:</p>
<p>As late as a century ago, poor white people, of many different  ethnic and religious backrounds, were economic slaves of factory owners.  Many of these factory workers were children who were denied the chance to go to school, would be maimed in a factory accident, and the factory owner would be just pay $5.00 to the parents and forget about the life-long suffering inflicted upon the child.</p>
<p>These economic factory slaves would work from sun up to sun down for a pittance just to barely survive in misery, while the factory owners would live in what would be a life of oppulence for that time period.</p>
<p>So if there are to be reparations to blacks for slavery, why not have reparations to the decendents of these factory workers!?</p>

So the Senate has passed an apology for slavery. But this apology will probably only fuel the reparations advocates. This is why reparations won&rsquo;t work in America.</p>
<p>Most important issue is that everyone who owned slaves is dead. Next, most people who are descendants of slaves do not know from whom they are descended, they cannot prove that descent, and they do not know to whom to send the bill.</p>
<p>Another issue is that slaves from the United States need to get in line. Here is a short list of those in front of American slave descendants: the Jews are in line to get monetary reparations for 400 years of slavery by the Egyptians, they also have a case pending against the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Assyrians, Philistines, Romans, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Ottomans, and English; next the Babylonian descendants were slaves to the Persians, the Persian descendants need reparations from the Greeks, the Greeks and the rest of the Mediterranean and European areas need money back from the Romans, the Scots and Welsh are line to get money from the English, the Irish as well&hellip;<br>
<i>African descendants should first go after those who live on the west coast of Africa, as they were the slavers who captured them and sold them in the first place.&#8221; </i></p>

		<p>I want an apology to me, and other Whites, who were, and continue to be, Victims of Affirmative Action selection for Schools, Colleges, and jobs, as well as promotions that we clearly earned, by getting the highest scores on the exams, but were not promoted, due to the Color of Our Skin. </p>
<p>Whites have been victims of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; through rampant crime, which they are, more often than not, on the receiving end of extreme violence from these mindless brutes. </p>
<p>Whites have lost the value of their largest investment, their homes, when Blacks, and other Minorities were forced into Our Neighborhoods, by Uncle Sambo. </p>
<p>So, where is Our Apology and Reparations? </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell the Black Caucus they they have been paid 1,000 times over for the relatively few Blacks that were Slaves, to an even smaller White population, through Affirmative Action, Welfare, &#8220;Empowerment Zones&#8221; Contract Set-Asides for Black Businesses, whether they can do the work or not, and the &#8220;Fair Housing&#8221; Act, which is anything but fair to Whites, and their families.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Senate passed a resolution on Thursday calling on the United States to apologize officially for the enslavement and segregation of millions of blacks and to acknowledge &ldquo;the fundamental injustice, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right! My (mostly) Irish ancestors came over to Australia to get away from English oppression. As far as I can gather from family talk, they arrived here, get on with thier lives (they did) were still looked down upon by their new lords here in Oz (the Brits), but it was better here and the farms that my grandparents founded were successful.</p>

		<p>This thing is never going to die.  Not even if the U.S. votes unaimiously to pay reparations.  Because even after they decide how much and who will pay (which would be an overwhelming task), any amount of reparations is NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

It makes a BIG difference.  As for most blacks knowing that their own kind sold them into bondage, I must respectfully disagree.  Please read my statement about the professor who gives tours of the embarkation points for the slave trade.<br>
It is time to remove the blame for slavery on the white man and put it where it belongs.  The WHITE MAN (first in Great Britain) was the FIRST to abolish slavery.<br>
There is NO ONE living today that owned slaves.<br>
Slavery was an institution which KNEW NO COLOR and was an accepted part of society (and still is in africa  &mdash;  look at the muslim slave traders of today).<br>

		<p>I am sorry that black slaves were brought to America centuries ago.  Are blacks sorry that they invented slavery millenniums ago in Africa and that it has continued unabated in Africa to this very day?  And are blacks aware of the fact that the black slaves in America lived much better than their black ancestors in Africa do today?  Are blacks aware of the fact that they commit a grossly disproportionate percentage of crimes in every white country they reside in?  Are blacks aware of the fact that their days remaining in the world&rsquo;s white nations are numbered?   </p>

<p>See the thread from Thursday about rep&rsquo;s.  The black &#8220;elite&#8221; know that average blacks would blow reparations money on bling, and they come up with come bull excuse that it&rsquo;s because of the trauma of slavery and PTSD flashbacks upon seeing the reparations checks.

		<p>The existence of free labor that was slavery precluded the development and growth of a white bourgeoise middle class in the antebellum South.  If you were white in the South, there was hardly any middle ground between being to the manor born and being dirt poor.</p>
<p>And since that did not exist, it made it a lot harder (notwithstanding post-WBTS economic discrimination and vengenace) to develop a working mainly unionized middle class.</p>
<p>If anyone needs reparations, it is the descendants of ante-bellum poor southern whites.</p>

However this is small in comparison to the biggest scam of all time which of course is the election of Obama.
