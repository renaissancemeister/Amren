<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article6475123.ece">English Acquires Its Millionth Word</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Macintyre, Times of London, June 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>English has now acquired its millionth word, according to a website monitoring the extraordinary emergence of new English throughout the world, including slang, word-marriages with other languages and the thousands of new terms spawned by the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Million Word milestone brings to notice the coming of age of English as the first truly global language&#8221;, said Paul J.J. Payack, president and chief word analyst of the Global Language Monitor.</p>
<p>Whether one accepts Mr Payack&rsquo;s claim depends on how one defines the word &#8220;word&#8221;.</p>
<p>As of 2005, the Oxford English Dictionary contained 301,100 main entries. Adding in combination words, derivatives and phrases brings the OED total to 616,500 word-forms.</p>
<p>The Global Language Monitor, however, accepts as a word any coinage that has gained sufficiently wide usage: this includes hybrid words in Chinglish (Chinese English), Hinglish (Hindi English), Spanglish (Spanish English), Hollywords (terms created by the film industry), computer jargon and words forged by the internet.</p>
<p>Appropriately enough, the 1,000,000th word accepted as genuine yesterday was &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; which was defined as &#8220;the next generation of web products and services, coming soon to a browser near you&#8221;.</p>
<p>Three other terms narrowly lost out to &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; in the race the million mark: &#8220;Jai Ho!&#8221; a Hinglish expression signifying a major accomplishment; &#8220;slumdog&#8221; (made popular by the film Slumdog Millionaire), meaning a child slum dweller, and &#8220;n00b&#8221;, a mixture of letters and zeros which is a mocking term for a newcomer in the online gamer community.</p>
<p>If the Global Language Monitor is right in its calculation, for every French word, there are now ten in English, or nearly-English.</p>
<p>Mr Payack and his colleagues use what they call a Predictive Quantities Indicator to assess whether a usage qualifies as a word: each contender is analysed according to depth (number of citations) and breadth (geographic extent of word usage), as well as the number of times a word has appeared in the global print and electronic media, the Internet, blogs, and social media such as Twitter and YouTube. Words need a minimum of 25,000 citations to qualify.</p>
<p>Purists, professional lexicographers and traditional Scrabble players are all likely to reject many of the words accepted by the Global Language Monitor.</p>
<p>But whether or not English can be said to contain a million real words, the survey reflects the extraordinary explosion of modern English, and the way its rapid spread has caused the language to mutate into new, wonderful and sometimes baffling shapes.</p>
<p>A generation ago, some 250 million spoke English. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people speak the language as a primary, secondary or business language. About 250 million people are learning English in China alone.</p>
<p>Mr Payack estimates that new words are entering the language at the rate of 14.7 words a day. The internet has also revived the possibilities for independent word-coinage in a way not seen since Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, when the language was acquiring its modern structure and words were being invented faster than ever before. Of the 24,000 words used by Shakespeare, some 1,700 were his own inventions.</p>
<p>The internet has ushered in the second great age of neologism (new words), with an astonishing efflorescence of words and phrases to describe new ideas or reshape old ones. In the past, a word slowly spread and gained acceptance through usage or literature. If a word works today, the internet can breathe instant life into it, and as a result, modern, non-standard English is evolving at warp speed.</p>
<p>The language of the internet has itself evolved, with words that were once preserve of the cyber-boffins gaining universal acceptance: blog, byte, e-mail, spam, twitter and so on. Ancient or Classic Geek has evolved into Modern Geek.</p>
<p>The spread of English in the 20th century was remarkable enough: in the first decade of the 21st century, however, it has evolved and expanded more rapidly, and more strangely, than any language in history. Jai Ho!<br>

		<p>I happen to think that the official lexicographers are way too quick to accept slang words or phrases as real words.  Oxford ought to worry about the King&rsquo;s English; there are websites like the Slang Dictionary that can handle the rest.</p>
<p>As Latin was the dominant language of the world in the Roman Empire, and vulgar Latin gradually drifted into the Romance languages of today, I think this is the start of the forking of English, based on the &#8220;diverse&#8221; populations that &#8220;speak&#8221; it, into many derivatives.</p>

		<p>Q.D., I think you are quite right.  The way English is being used- or rather, misused, and on such a broad scale, I think it is accurate to say that it is indeed forked. </p>

		<p>Virtually every other person across Europe from non-English speaking nations speak the English language - and speak it well! Tens of millions of Hispanics in America not only cannot, but refuse to learn. Is this a world that makes sense to anyone??</p>

		<p>&hellip;..&#8221;Hispanics would rather speak Spanish.&#8221;</p>
<p>I honestly believe, through long observation in California and through reading, that the difficulty in getting many hispanics to use English is mainly the fault of Mexicans and Mexico. So many Mexicans have this misplaced pride (misplaced in the U.S.)that if they put Enlgish first they are somehow wimping out, where their connection to Mexico is concerned. No hispanic group has been more intransigent when it comes to assimilation as Mexicans have been. This has been observed over and over. This is why I say, it is mainly having Mexico on the border that is making it hard to assimilate other Spanish speakers. It is a documented fact, that the Mexican government has been allowed to interfere with America&rsquo;s culture and language over and over. </p>

		<p>I have traveled around the world and have been to 56 different countries.  I will learn the standard &#8220;please, thank you, good morning, hello&#8221; etc. in the native language.  I am always amazed at the amount of people who have learned the English language.  Especially in the Asian countries.  Most of the time, when I try to use the native language, they will respond in English, excited by the chance to use it on a native English speaker.</p>

		<p>China will soon be the largest speaking English country in the world. All students from grade 3 up are taught English. Almost everyone under the age of 25 can already read a lot of English, but have poor pronunciation - but that will change.</p>
<p>Everything that is, was, and defined the White West has been given away, hijacked, or sold to Blacks, China, Africa, India etc. Technology, critical thinking, Christianity, Art, management systems, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>Due to their large overwhelming numbers all that was the White West will be hijacked AND continuously modified and corrupted until it no longer is recognizable as White West.</p>
<p>And the White Ruling Elite who put Obama in office, promoted and financed Globalism, promote and finance Afro-centric America, promote and finance anti-White History, anti-White Western Hollywood, promote and finance the rise of China, will one day wake up and wonder what happened to their OWN children and family who were assimilated by the multicultural, politically correct monsters THEY created.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile the White Masses slave away in corporations, schools, and an environment that is eating them up one bite at at time, like a cancer or infection AND they are becoming older, weaker, and unable to even think clearly or understand what the disease is that killed them.</p>

		<p><i>think this is the start of the forking of English</i></p>
<p>For a language to fork, it requires that different groups of users of that language be relatively isolated from each other for long periods of time. With the advent of the internet, this will probably never happen again. The world is simply too small now. Language forking is a thing of the past. What we&rsquo;re seeing now is the opposite phenomenon, with less-prevalent languages being abandoned and dying out in favor of a few major languages like English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese and Arabic. This process will probably eventually end with everyone in the world speaking the same language (perhaps English) and all other languages forgotten. </p>

<p>It looks like corporate America intends to import every last one of them to displace the rapidly diminishing number of Americans still employed.  If I am right who will you target first; the imported Red Chinese slaves or the American traitors who employ them? </p>

		<p>In actuality English possesses one BILLION words if you include all the names of insects and their body parts and many other terms with the exclusion of the name of places.</p>
<p>Compared to other languages English can express infinitely more complexities with one word whereas the other languages require clunky phrases to express everyday matters.</p>

		<p>English is indeed forking.</p>
<p>Scots is already split off and acknowledged as a separate language. Personally, I would split off Hard New York (Queens) and Newfoundland Fisherman English too. Neither is comprehensible. There are many advocates for splitting AAVE (Ebonics). I&rsquo;ve listened to them for hours on end and can barely catch a word.</p>
<p>Many British English accents are hard to hear. I want subtitles on East Midlands speakers on US TV. Geordie and Scouse are notorious. I can&rsquo;t make sense of Northumbrian, and Yorkshire is terrible. I even find Bristol hard to follow.</p>
<p>All of the West Indian creoles are long since split off. Chinglish is spoken in Singapore, and you will not be able to follow it. West African English gets subtitles on US TV.</p>
<p>East Indian English is spoken well as a native language in India. If you watch a video of these folks giving a lecture, it&rsquo;s very hard to understand. You want subtitles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really true that all the small languages are dying and only big ones will survive. There is a huge revival in small languages underway, especially in Europe. A lot of languages are forking. Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has probably already split into 3-4 separate languages. Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese get further apart by the year. Chilean Spanish keeps morphing and Chilean Spanish telenovelas get subtitles in Latin America because no one can make sense of them.</p>
