<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8081718.stm">Stars Try to Energise Slovak Voters</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Chittenden, BBC, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Giant chickens, pop stars and celebrities have all been recruited to end Slovakia&rsquo;s record as the EU&rsquo;s most apathetic country.</p>
<p>At its first-ever Euro elections in 2004 the turnout was just 17%. So on 6 June the big question is whether the voters can lift their country off the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>Among the candidates is sitting MEP Peter Stastny of the centre-right SDKU party. He is a former ice hockey star who captained the national team to their first Olympics at Lillehammer in 1994. He says the record low turnout should be a matter of shame to the Slovak people, and is in favour of celebrities on the candidates&rsquo; list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely we welcome this,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You know we&rsquo;re being asked many times what we&rsquo;re doing to make sure we don&rsquo;t finish last. And I say I&rsquo;m a professional athlete, I hate to be last. I would do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breaking the mould</b></p>
<p>African-born singer and comedian Ibrahim Maiga is running for the left-wing SDL party. He is a well-known figure, whose infectious humour and songs about his homeland Mali may well boost support for his anti-racist campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think Slovak people are racist,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I really want to fight this election just to show Europe that Slovakia has a great future in Europe. If I&rsquo;m elected and for the first time in history a black man represents Slovakia that&rsquo;s going to be obvious to all of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no obvious single reason for the Slovaks&rsquo; reluctance to vote. It is certainly not because of public dislike of EU institutions. On the contrary, recent polls suggest they have more trust for the European Parliament than in any other member state.</p>
<p>Robert Hajsel, head of the Slovakia office for the European Parliament, suggests this contentment may explain the low turnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are actually happy and maybe don&rsquo;t feel this need to change something,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If they are satisfied with the European Parliament sometimes they really don&rsquo;t see that they have to go and vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if this &#8220;if it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it&#8221; explanation fails to convince, Mr Hajsel offers another: voter fatigue. He says the 2004 elections may have come too soon after a vote to join the EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were asked to go and vote just one year after the EU membership referendum, when 90% said yes. When the people were asked to vote again, they didn&rsquo;t know why.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Raising awareness</b></p>
<p>The EU has been doing its own bit to boost voting, with three-dimensional installations dotted round Slovakia&rsquo;s main towns. Each poses questions about how voters can shape the world around them.</p>
<p>In a central Bratislava square, three large warning signs ask how much security people might want. In Trnava, 50km away, there is a bizarre display of two giant wrapped chickens, which focuses on consumer protection.</p>
<p>But Slovakia&rsquo;s experience is just part of a trend toward lower turnouts right across the EU. Falling voter numbers prompt questions about how representative MEPs really are, according to Dr Julie Smith, Senior Lecturer at Cambridge University&rsquo;s Centre of International Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The argument from the parliamentarians has always been &#8216;We are the recipients of democratic legitimacy, we have a direct mandate&rsquo;,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know turnout of under 20% clearly raises questions about the integration process of the European Union itself. And it raises questions about just how much support those MEPs have got.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there is more than national pride at stake. In 2004 Slovakia&rsquo;s first-placed party won the support of less than 3% of the total electorate. This time the target for campaigners is modest: an increase in turnout sufficient to lift them off the foot of the table, and restore the tattered reputation of Slovakia&rsquo;s voters.</p>

		<p>Well, I think that blacks in Zimbabwe should give free housing and welfare and affirmative action to the displaced whites there to prove they aren&rsquo;t racist. I mean, we have to be equal and free, yes?</p>

		<p>Why are the Slovakians allowing this African into their tiny Country. Haven&rsquo;t they learned anything from Western Europe&rsquo;s invasion by these thugs? </p>
<p>I am watching the EU Election results with anticipation. So far, according to the Council of Conservative Citizens, https://www.cofcc.org, the British National Party (BNP) has taken three seats in City, and County, elections. </p>
<p>Similar result were reported in Holland. The EU Parliament Election reults were not yet reported. </p>
<p>Maybe this is the beginning that we are waiting for, to turn the tide on non-White Immigration, and attacks on our European Cultures, and Faith.</p>

<p>They are almost exclusively university students. This is why Central Europeans think that Africans are mostly polite and decent people. </p>

		<p>Would the people of Mali elect a white person to represent them?  Probably not - and, therefore, they must be racist.</p>

<p>There are quite a few southern Europeans who could pass for middle eastern and vice versa.  Religion (christianity vs islam) and culture are the main distinctions between these two regions of Eurasia.</p>

		<p>Having lived in Poland a few years back I was shocked to see the number of blacks now living in Warsaw when I went back. Trust me the Hollywoodisation of society is at risk of happening there too even if most are still race realist.<br>
Still the backlash is now starting in the West as the recent elections show and if needs be can spread East.</p>

		<p>Eastern Europe experienced real Marxist dictatorships. As a result they are today much much more conservative than their western European counterparts. One needs only to look at the reaction to Chariman Obama&rsquo;s election. In the UK they were gushing over him and lamenting that the UK hasn&rsquo;t yet elected a black prime minister. Same for France. In Poland parliament members made jokes about how Obama may be part polish because one of his ancestors ate a Pole. Slovaks don&rsquo;t want Africans representing them and they don&rsquo;t need to prove their anti-racist credentials to anyone. I pray to God that the Nationalists in Slovkia, Poland and the rest of formerly Marxist Eastern Europe take power and prevent their beautiful countries from ending up like Londonistan, Rotterdamistan, Paristan, etc.<br>
Keep in mind that the area between Berlin and the Ural mountains is home to the largest (and last) majority white populations on earth. <br>
Poland and Russia must put aside their tribal squabbling and unite to face the common enemy of EU Marxism. </p>

<p>  If they are like the African students who come to American Universities, they won&rsquo;t be returning home. Their reputation in Central Europe may be good but the same cannot be said about China. Obviously, a few act one way but a crowd behaves differently.  I doubt many Central European Students go to school in Africa or remain afterwards. </p>
