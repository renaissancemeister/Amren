<h1>Nearly 60% Won&rsquo;t Graduate at South Side School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Williams, KCAL-TV (Los Angeles), June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A startling number of children are falling through the cracks at one Chicago Public School. More than half of the kids didn&rsquo;t even pass the eighth grade. As CBS 2&rsquo;s Jim Williams reports there is fierce debate about who&rsquo;s to blame.</p>
<p>It is a debate that has gone on for years in poor communities: do you blame the schools for the students&rsquo; poor performance or do you blame their parents?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was a disastrous year for the eighth grade at the south side Bradwell Elementary school in a tough neighborhood with high poverty. More than half the class, 44 of 77 students, did not graduate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Board of Education insists the Bradwell school did everything possible to keep the students&rsquo; grades up, offering extra credit and school on Saturday. And the Board says written notices did go out.</p>

		<p>What amazes me more than anything is that there is a school in the Chicago City Public School system that:  (1) Has standards.  (2) Abides by those standards, (3) Even toward black students.  </p>
<p>As an Illinoisan, if you factor out Cook County and St. Clair County (East St. Louis), and patches of black areas in Jackson County (Carbondale, Murphysboro) and Cairo, the public schools are almost all white.</p>

		<p>If half failed&hellip;.half passed. Of the half that passed, Id bet 50% were passed to improve the schools record and get funding&hellip;.so 25% passed by white standards&hellip;.barely.</p>

<p><br>
Uh&hellip; you blame the entire community of single &#8220;baby mama&#8221; parents and their thug ex-boyfriends who impregnated them and continue to roam free.  Between them, they allow a thug culture to permeate their offspring.  This phenomenon is well into the third generation, and the parents are no better than the kids.</p>

		<p>60% failed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely amazed.  There must have been some kind of cheating going on if only 60% failed.</p>
<p>The story said everything posible was done to bring up the grades.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure there was considerable fudging of grades on the remaining 40%.</p>

		<p>What is this nonsense about &#8220;falling through the cracks?&#8221; The amount of attention lavished upon all these &#8220;at-risk&#8221; inner-city/urban youth is unprecidented! They don&rsquo;t fall through any cracks - they waltz through the yawning chasms of a society gone mad; a society no longer interested in merit, achievement, excellence, or even sense&hellip;only &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;inclusion&#8221; at all costs!   </p>

		<p>AGAIN! poverty is to blame. At least this time it isn&rsquo;t Whites in general being blamed for the failure YET! I personally don&rsquo;t see the relationship between being poor and doing school work,I did and did/and am doing fine. In the case of blacks, FAILURE IS AN OPTION!</p>

<p>Neither. You give most of the blame to God for deciding to grant blacks less intelligence than any other ethnic group. </p>

		<p>As I read this article I was on the phone with a friend of mine.  I mentioned the article and she said she went to Bradwell in the 50s when it was all white.  She said it was a great school.  Later her son went to the school for a little while in the late 60s and it was almost entirely black.  She said the blacks tormented her son constantly.  They did stuff like sticking him with needles.  When she found out about it she yanked him from the school, but at first her son never told her what was happening.  Talk to your kids and tell them to tell you if they are harrassed.</p>

<p>   It takes a lot of human pride and arrogance to sit in judgment on God Himself. </p>
<p>   Black people are responsible for their own behavior just as everyone else is.</p>

<p>How about blaming the government that pays all the living expenses for and allows generations of welfare recipients to over- breed at will?  I had to hold my childbearing to three because that is all I could afford  &mdash;  I am going broke paying for extremely expensive entitlement services here in California that are granted to 50% of hispanics generation after generation with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor is certainly correct when he writes in Paved With Good Intentions that those who receive government assistance should be fitted with NorPlant immediately so they will not bring yet more fatherless children into the world to burden the rest of us.</p>
<p>It frosts me when hostile elites make their snide remarks about the Dugger family.  When I worked in the inner-city, fatherless, welfare families of 10-14 children were common, especially among hispanics, but among blacks as well.  Yet, to the hostile elites, this is OK, especially as they will replace Whites by out-breeding us.</p>

		<p>The stat provides another snapshot of America being led into third-world socialism - the long term objective of leftists seeking empowerment by dumbing down the herd while simultaneously enlarging it. </p>
<p>Create a large enough population of unemployable incompetants dependent on welfare, and guess what kind of government that will turn out to be?</p>
