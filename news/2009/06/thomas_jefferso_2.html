			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynette Holloway, Black Voices, June 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Contrary to popular belief, President Thomas Jefferson did not father the children of his slave, Sally Hemings, according to William G. Hyland Jr., author of &#8216;In Defense of Thomas Jefferson: The Sally Hemings Sex Scandal.&rsquo; It was his brother Randolph, &#8220;a ne&rsquo;er-do-well,&#8221; who had a history of consorting with his brother&rsquo;s slaves.</p>
<p>Hyland, a lawyer and member of the board of directors of the Thomas Jefferson Society, says the DNA results that established a link between Hemings and Thomas Jefferson implicated the wrong man. Randolph, 13 years younger, would have the identical Jefferson Y chromosome as his older brother and would have been a match for the DNA, he says.</p>
<p>Further, Randolph was at Monticello around the time of conception of each of Hemings&rsquo;s children, including Eston, the youngest. Hyland spends a great deal of time trying to link Hemings and Randolph and exculpating Thomas Jefferson from the relationship, arguing, in part, that a ruffian, not a refined man would mingle with slaves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hyland also tries to overturn theories mapped out in Annette Gordon-Reed&rsquo;s groundbreaking tome, &#8216;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy.&rsquo; The effort is not new. A long line of historians has concluded that the affair was unfounded. But Gordon-Reed&rsquo;s research put it on the map. Hemings was the half-sister of Jefferson&rsquo;s wife, Martha Wayles, who died in 1782, after which he never remarried. Both Hemings and Jefferson remained silent on the affair.</p>
<p>Hyland took time from his busy schedule to discuss his book with BV Bookshelf:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>We&rsquo;ve never really heard Jefferson&rsquo;s side of the story. You address that.</b></p>
<p>He basically denied the allegation in private. He wrote a long letter to his Secretary of Navy Robert Smith and basically denied the allegations. But he never in public denied it. That was kind of his routine and practice. He believed if he denied one thing in public that another thing would crop up and then another thing. So he never denied it in public, but he did deny it in private to his friends and family. Randolph is really the one who had the affair with Sally. There is no doubt that a Jefferson fathered one or more of her children. It&rsquo;s just a question of whether it was Thomas Jefferson or some other Jefferson.</p>
<p><b>Why do you think it&rsquo;s Randolph?</b></p>
<p>There were a number of factors. They had the same Y chromosome DNA that would have matched. Again, DNA was never taken from Thomas Jefferson because he didn&rsquo;t have any male children. Randolph had six male children. Thomas had all female children except for a small infant who died and the DNA match was to a male child. So the DNA match was to a male child. So Randolph was more likely to be the father.</p>
<p>Also he was kind of a ne&rsquo;er-do-well partier. I mean he actually socialized with the slaves. The kicker and hard evidence I found was a really obscure letter that was in the archives at the University of Virginia written from Thomas Jefferson to his brother on August 12, 1807. That was about nine months before [Sally] gave birth to Eston who was the DNA match. The letter invites Randolph to Monticello. In all probability he was there at the conception time for Eston.</p>
<p>You say that like it&rsquo;s a bad thing, socializing with the servants and the slaves .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>That was something that Thomas Jefferson, a refined person, would not think to do at that time. But for Randolph it perfectly was natural. It wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing. I just put it out as a different mindset of the two brothers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the book will be received .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>There is no doubt it was a Jefferson. The question is which Jefferson? I just think the public hasn&rsquo;t heard the other side of the story. They&rsquo;ve only heard one side, especially after the DNA findings. That was the nail in the coffin. There are a lot more facts on both sides that need to be heard. I say in the book that I wanted to stabilize both sides to give a different perspective than what you&rsquo;ve heard. There are other facts and there are other inaccuracies. I really think the truth does matter.<br>

<i>&#8220;It will be interesting to see how the book will be received.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We know the answer.</p>
<p>Those who believe Thomas was the father refuse see any other possibility. For them, there is no question.</p>
<p>Maybe someday we&rsquo;ll have more advanced testing and be able to definetively settle the issue. Until then, the answer remains a question.<br>

		<p>I have talked to blacks about the Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings controversy.After discussing the issue most believe Thomas Jefferson impregnated Sally Hemmings.Later I ask the same people about O.J.Simpson&rsquo;s DNA implicating him in the murder his wife.Some of the same blacks I talked to said Simpson was railroaded and thought the DNA belonging to Simpson really belonged to another relative of his.More than one person thought Simpson&rsquo;s DNA was planted by the police. I thought the views of the people were on the subject interesting. </p>

		<p>This may be true, but political correctness trumps the truth every time. Did anyone see Ken Burn&rsquo;s film on Thomas Jefferson? The supposed black descendent of Thomas Jefferson claims this family has 150+ years of oral tradition that says they&rsquo;re descended fro Thomas Jefferson. Case closed!</p>

		<p>This story is kicking a dead horse.  Objective scholars who examined all the relevant evidence (DNA included) concluded there is no way to prove or disprove Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s alleged paternity of Sally Hemmings&rsquo; children.  Both sides of the controversy ignore that fact.</p>
<p>Hyland&rsquo;s &#8220;evidence&#8221; is weak at best.  It has been pointed out, for example, no one seriously considered Randolph Jefferson as a candidate until the DNA evidence showed conclusively the father was a member of Clan Jefferson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if Thomas Jefferson denied it in private.  While unquestionably a great statesman (and one of my favorite presidents) he was still human like the rest of us.  After the death of his beloved wife Martha it&rsquo;s not inconceivable to say he gave in to the pangs of loneliness and took up with Sally, a quadroon who was said to be fairly good-looking.  That wasn&rsquo;t uncommon back then.  Of course, unlike others, I admit that&rsquo;s pure speculation on my part.</p>
<p>For people who would agree with Hyland&rsquo;s assertion that a &#8220;refined person&#8221; like Jefferson would never take up with a slave girl, I need only remind you that after his death, Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s family acknowledged he produced a daughter with a black servant.</p>

		<p>      I find it interesting that the character of Mr Jefferson is never addressed. I mean after all Here was the author of the Decleration, coauthor of the Virginia Decleration of Religeous Independence,president of the U S I could go on and yet he is accused of an affair with Salley Hemmings. Doesnt the character he exhibited in his public life and day to day dealings with people mean anything?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the first  time I&rsquo;ve ever seen  anyone imply that Strom Thurmond had been &#8220;refined&#8221; or had had much in common with an intellectual giant like Thomas Jefferson. </p>
<p>Not that  Thurmond wasn&rsquo;t an impressive man. H.l. Mencken(no segregationist)  called him the best man of the four major candidates for POTUS in 1948. </p>

		<p>In responce to commenter no# 6, you must only go to the library and check out the rest of Jeffersons&rsquo; speach.    Also if you check out Abraham Lincolns&rsquo; true words, especially the things Abe said at his pre-election debate with Thomas Douglas you&rsquo;ll find some very interesting quotes.  There are many things said by our exhaulted leaders, if taught in history, instead of the excerpted phrases which seem to support egalitarianism, and multicultural society, were exposed we&rsquo;d have a much differant view of the world we&rsquo;ve been taught about.  Re-educate yourself, you are the only person you should trust with truth.</p>

<p>What character issues?  He was a widower.  He wasn&rsquo;t cheating on his wife.  She was his sister in-law and 3/4 white.  And it was both socially and legally impossible for him to marry her at the time even if he wanted to.  Their kids were 7/8 white and their decendents today are part of the white population.</p>

		<p>Oh,  I forgot to mention, I thought it somewhat amusing that the web site asked us to *vote* on whether Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings&rsquo;s children,  NOT, what is your opinion on the matter.  Objective questions, whether true or not, are not amenable to a public vote.  My vote would have no effect on the truth or falsity of the question.</p>

<p>Jefferson was referencing &#8220;class&#8221; not &#8220;race&#8221; in those words he addressed to King George.  The Founding Fathers knew that the races were anything but equal&hellip;<br>

<p>Anon,<br>
Strom Thurmond lived in a different time with different social protocols. The two situations aren&rsquo;t comparable. That&rsquo;s the same reason that Whites should not be held accountable for a practice that was outlawed almost two hundred years ago and for which we are still expected to do penance.<br>
I can&rsquo;t imagine any White person today who would approve of the keeping of slaves. <br>
Lincoln wanted to repatriate Blacks but could not get the approval of Congress.  He knew that the two races wouldn&rsquo;t be able to coexist harmoniously and he was so right. Too bad that those in Congress didn&rsquo;t recognize his foresight. There will never be a solution to the racial problem short of complete gepgraphic segregation or armed conflict.</p>
<p>Most Whites are not overtly racist. Yes many Whites have serious misgivings in regard to Blacks but that&rsquo;s due mostly to the sociopathic behavior of too many Blacks. Whites have cleaned their house. They admitted to the evils of slavery and apologized for it.  They&rsquo;ve provided trillions in treasure through taxes for failed fated government attempts to remedy any deficits suffered by Blacks as a result of the legacy of slavery many times sacrificing their own survival as a race by limiting the size of the families while Blacks reproduce at a prolific rate, do not raise their children properly and commit violent crime against each other and against Whites at an inordinate rate given their alleged percentage of the population.<br>
HIlary Clinton was the one who offered us the African proverb that &#8221; It takes a village to raise a child&#8221;.  That speaks volumes about the definition of a family in Africa. <br>
It takes, in the ideal situation, two parents to raise a child. One of them is a responsible male who with a boy teaches him the skills and values he needs to grow up to be a responsible male like his Dad. Most male animals, with the exception of some birds don&rsquo;t play an active epart in raising their young. They&rsquo;re merely sperm despositors.<br>
Humans are different. More sophisticated skills are needed in order to live in a &#8220;civilized&#8221; society where it&rsquo;s important to know how to interact with others for everyone&rsquo;s mutual benefit <br>
and safety.<br>
This is where Blacks fall short. Their children are left to their own devices or to a Grandmother who has no clue about raising kids because she didn&rsquo;t come from a stable family either. They grow up on the streets and become thugs and predators who seek only to satisfy their baser instincts, many times by violent means. <br>
One would think that they might learn by seeing that most Whites succeed because they don&rsquo;t live as Blacks do. They go to school and instead of emulating the behavior that seems to result in success, they create total havoc and turn the schools into places of fear and violence.<br>
I had a German Shepherd/ Doberman mix who in the first two years of his life, always squatted when he urinated. I never had a dog before and always wondered why he didn&rsquo;t lift his leg to pee. One day our neighbors had visitors who brought their pure bred Doberman. Both were neutered males so they got along just fine runnning and playing in the spacious yards. At one point the Doberman made a &#8220;pit stop&#8221; at one of the bushes in the neighbor&rsquo;s yard; lifting his leg and peeing. Our dog stood there watching with his head cocked to the side in typical dog curiosity fashion. He immediately tried to imitate the Doby and kept at it until he had mastered it. From then on for the entire 14 years of his life, he urinated just like a real &#8220;boy&#8221; dog. It&rsquo;s all about role models. </p>
<p><br>
Humans should set a higher standard </p>

<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>I could add to that. If they hate Whites so much why don&rsquo;t they emulate the Chinese,Korean, Filipino or Indian kids? Don&rsquo;t Blacks ever wonder why these people come here with nothing; not even the mastery of English ( with some exceptions in the case of Filipinos) and yet they survive and thrive in school. The fact is that the Blacks hate them too because they&rsquo;re envious of the achievments of the Asian kids.<br>
Iw would require an entire new mindset on the part of Blacks and I seriously suspect that they are either unable or unwilling to make the necessary changes in their lives. </p>
<p>I once had a student who was an ethnic Chinese born in Vietnam. His family was from the Cholon district of Saigon. It was like the Chinatown of Saigon. When he arrived here he spoke no English but was fluent in Vietnamese and Mandarin. By his Senior year he was speaking colloquial American English with little more than a trace of an accent and was an Honors student. Someone to emulate? Absolutely. Would Blacks emulate him? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>You miss the point. The point is that the media jumped on this story as if Jefferson&rsquo;s fathership was an established fact. As this story says, &#8220;Contrary to popular belief&hellip;&#8221; it has become popular belief only because of the way the media shamelessly distorted the story when it first broke. It was never a common belief before that. It was all part of the media&rsquo;s ongoing campaign to depict whites as moral failures in any matter involving race.</p>
