<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31105689/">Tourette&rsquo;s Most Common in White Kids, Boys</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tourette syndrome occurs in 3 out of every 1,000 school-aged children, and is more than twice as common in white kids as in blacks or Hispanics, according to the largest U.S. study to estimate how many have the disorder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The racial gaps are probably the most surprising finding, said study&rsquo;s authors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to this, we really had very little information about minorities,&#8221; said Lawrence Scahill, a Yale University researcher. The study was released Thursday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear why whites have a higher rate or if future studies will find the same disparity, experts said. Some suspect it has less to do with genetics than with a difference in access to medical care or in attitudes about whether repetitive blinking or other tics require medical care.</p>
<p>The study, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates there are about 150,000 U.S. children with Tourette&rsquo;s, below the 200,000 threshold for rare diseases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tourette&rsquo;s is characterized by involuntary, sudden and repetitive movements. They may be as mild as blinking, nose twitching or grimacing, or severe as head jerking or other motions that cause chronic pain or injury. Some also have vocal tics that range from grunting and throat-clearing to barking and swearing.</p>
<p><b>Fades after adolescence</b></p>
<p>The condition tends to peak in early adolescence and fades afterward. Scientists don&rsquo;t know the cause, but believe genetics are at least part of the answer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The researchers found that the Tourette&rsquo;s rate in white children was about 4 per 1,000, while the rate for both blacks and Hispanics was about 1.5.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at parental education and household income, and found those factors did not explain the racial difference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Males, due their &#8220;Y&#8221; chromosome, can more easily express a phenotype than females and are generally the party of genetic exceptions, so it is no surprise that boys are affected more frequently.</p>
<p>It is my understanding, somewhat contrary to what was indicated in the AP article, that Tourette&rsquo;s is a disorder of inhibition. A group noted for its lack of inhibition might be less affected by such a disorder, because if it ain&rsquo;t there, you can&rsquo;t break it. </p>
<p>An over-simplification that probably has a germ of truth. </p>

		<p>Perhaps there is a lot of copralalia (filthy mouth) among Blacks that is undiagnosed because it sounds like ordinary ghetto speech?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly replying to this topic, for that I apologize but it is in line with Amren topics as a whole.</p>
<p>This white girl has a Touerette&rsquo;s like condition but will not pass on to her progeny:<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/luurvh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/luurvh</a></p>
<p>From the article:<br>
Now that they&rsquo;ve all left ol&rsquo; Hef, E! has given Kendra   &mdash;   the dopey, youngest girl from &#8220;The Girls Next Door,&#8221; the one with the Tourettes-like cackle and huge boobs   &mdash;   her own reality show. </p>
<p>I have to give Ms. Stasi credit for standing up to the Hefster:<br>
 When Kendra asks if he&rsquo;s wearing cologne, Hef, who fancies himself an intellectual but shows himself to be a big bigot, says, &#8220;I smell like an Italian whore!&#8221;</p>
<p>A what? What if he&rsquo;d said, &#8220;Black whore,&#8221; or &#8220;Jewish whore,&#8221; or other ethnic slur? It would never have made the cut. </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s 100% right. I could not imagine Hef saying any other but a White Ethnic Whore.</p>
<p>Anyway I can&rsquo;t wait to see this exciting new show that Hollywood has cooked up for us.</p>
<p>Regarding this article, one wonders in this day and age, especially when Obama has appointed a Health &#8220;Sergeant at Arms&#8221; so to speak, https://tinyurl.com/lf8ct7, how much is spent in relative dollars on Sickle Cell and other minority (and distinctly women&rsquo;s vs men&rsquo;s) issues.</p>

		<p>More males are geniuses and so are more mental defectives. It is probably because all recessive traits on the X are expressed in males since they have only one. The feminists complain about the &#8220;unfair&#8221; success of men but never about the abundance of afflicted boys.</p>

		<p>Tourettes may be related to neural development.  </p>
<p>It is now well known that Ashkhenazi Jews have higher IQs as well as higher incidences of diseases such as Taysachs, which are due to genetic mutations affecting the development of neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing Tourettes may be a similar issue, in the sense that when a population such as whites in general, or Jews, develops mutations beneficially affecting brain development, sometimes those same mutations may lead to genetic diseases affecting neural development.</p>

		<p>   I live in the black belt, worked routes in predominantly black neighborhoods for over ten years . Take my word for it,they have their share of neurological/psychological maladies . But like some of the posters here have stated, what is considered abnormal for whites is accepted as personality traits in the African/American community .</p>

		<p>This may be a selection bias without any real genetic cause.  So many blacks and Hispanics already talk as if they had Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome that diagnosing the genuine cases would be quite difficult.</p>

		<p>Who is fooling whom. Blacks and Hispanics are constantly mumbling swear words and racial epithets to themselves as they walk the grocery store aisles, wait on subway platforms, or even sit in public school classrooms. They don&rsquo;t get classified with Tourette Syndrome because that would be a racist infringement on their freedom of expression.</p>

<p><br>
Several years before his death the late, nationally-syndicated writer Art Buchwald wrote an op-ed piece that appeared in the NY Daily News.  The jist of this piece was that anti-Italianism is the last &#8220;socially acceptable&#8221; form of ethnic bigotry left in the United States.  </p>
<p>I hate to say it, but that&rsquo;s in large part the fault of Italians themselves.  Most of them don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with comments like those spewed by &#8220;Hef&#8221; (or at least, pretend they don&rsquo;t).  Eleanor Roosevelt was right about one thing:</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can take advantage of you without your permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lesson everyone in the &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; movement should note.</p>

		<p>The comments suggesting Tourette&rsquo;s in blacks may simply be undiagnosed as normal urban behavior are amusing, but to be fair, I think they are off the mark.</p>
<p>The woeful mannerisms referred to are, I believe, more a contemporary social phenomenon rather than a genetic disposition.  If you go back 50 years or so, before they got &#8220;liberated&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think you would find blacks as being particularly noted for foul-mouthedness.</p>
