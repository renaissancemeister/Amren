<h1>10 000 Child Prostitutes in Johannesburg</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alet Rademeyer and Philip de Bruin, News24 (Cape Town), June 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are about 10 000 child prostitutes in Johannesburg alone, a group concerned with child abuse said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bloemfontein, meanwhile, is one of the biggest focal points of syndicates as far as trafficking in children for sex and drug trading are concerned.</p>
<p>A founding member of Sapsac, a body investigating child abuse, Retha Meintjes, who is also the deputy director of public prosecution, says even though similar figures are not available for other cities, all the available information indicates that the situation in Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth are &#8220;equally grave&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to Sapsac, girls in South Africa are sold for between R2 500 and R12 000.</p>
<p>Countrywide networks of syndicates who are involved in child abuse include &#8220;prominent and wealthy&#8221; people, even some from the medical field.</p>
<p>Children as young as 10 &#8220;are recruited and sexually abused by adults who pay the syndicates&#8221;.</p>
<p>Children who work in Port Elizabeth as prostitutes and/or drug dealers, earn between R1 500 and R5 000 per day for the coffers of their &#8220;handlers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sapsac said the children who disobeyed the syndicates&rsquo; instructions were punished with &#8220;extreme physical abuse, or by withholding drugs and food from them or even death&#8221;.</p>
<p>The group said it will make an urgent plea to the government to enforce effective measures to protect children, especially with a view to the huge international sporting events which will soon take place in South Africa.</p>
<p><b>530 child rapes in SA every day</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile the  CEO of Solidarity&rsquo;s Helping Hand, Danie Langner, said that thousands of South African children were victims of rape, abuse, countrywide child prostitution networks and even murder.</p>
<p>Every day about 530 children are raped in South Africa, and of these, only about 60 are reported.</p>
<p>Children are the victims in 45% of all rape cases in the country.</p>
<p>The report said 1 410 cases of child murder were reported between 2007 and 2008 in the country  &mdash;  22.4% up from the previous year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must become known that of all the cases in which Childline becomes active, 43% involve the sexual abuse of children,&#8221; Langer said.</p>
<p>Louise Aucamp, a forensic social worker, said child crime rates in the middle-to-high income groups, where both parents are graduates and respected members of their community, have increased by a disturbing amount over the past two years.</p>
<p>During the course of Helping Hand&rsquo;s research, many social workers and people who deal with child abuse on a daily basis were interviewed. A serious shortage of experts was identified.</p>
<p>Organisations like Child Care South Africa works with about two million children and their families on an annual basis. This means the average social worker must handle about 200 cases annually, while the accepted norm is 60. <br>

		<p>While this situation is pretty bad, it&rsquo;s certainly not the worst that goes on in the baby-rape capitol of the world.</p>
<p>Crime is so bad the society will be dysfunctional in a short while, and it&rsquo;s very likely there will be a civil war there before too much longer, so writing about this is like reporting on crime in Detroit in the US, while the entire country is in a depression and set to completely collapse.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s NOT funny. It is a tragedy. And &#8220;liberal&#8221; zealots bear guilt, too, when they make it possible that places turn into hellholes.</p>

		<p>Martel, Madison Grant meant &#8220;funny&#8221; in a peculiar sense, NOT a humorous sense. His point is that black pimps weren&rsquo;t openly trafficking child prostitutes in the old South Africa.</p>
<p>If you consider it a tragedy, then take a plane to South Africa, waggle your finger at the pimps, and tell them of this tragedy.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s just normal black behavior, not only in South Africa, but the world over.</p>

		<p>Statistics coming out of South Africa are pretty much meaningless. 10000 Child prostitutes in Johannesburg alone? 530 children raped daily countrywide, with only 60 of them reported? Reminds me of that computer security conference where the speaker said, as a joke,  that 78% of hacking attempts are never detected (think about it), and many in the audience took it at face value.</p>
<p>The second paragraph is poignant for me.  I grew up in Bloemfontein.  In those days, they sounded a siren at 9 p.m. every night, and thereafter all blacks had to be off the streets in the white residential areas.  Result: I could go anywhere, at any time of the day or night, alone, in perfect safety.  And I did.  We&rsquo;ve tried it both ways now, integrated and segregated. Can we go back to the way that works, now?</p>

<p>We could say the same thing of a number of large American cities but it seems the bleeding hearts are still and ONLY interested in black Africans! No mention of the White South Africans being murdered so frequently, for info see www.zasucks.com</p>

<p>It did happen, I don&rsquo;t understand why this is only being brought up now. Even during the apartheid era such syndicates were being run. Just because segregation existed didn&rsquo;t mean that black South Africans didn&rsquo;t suffer what they do now. The differences between pre- and post-apartheid as I see it are: Higher crime rates (esp. robbery), higher literacy rates (although those who have received an education don&rsquo;t usually do much with it), and higher rate of AIDs (although I&rsquo;ve heard the rate of growth is slowing). Segregation only works up to as much as keeping whites comfortable in my opinion, blacks still suffer. To revert would be selfishness from my point of view. &#8220;Separate but equal&#8221; sounds alright, but as of now its not attainable. For those of you who long for a return to Apartheid, have you not thought that in a nation where whites are a pitiful minority (10% at last count), that no one would actually care about right wing groups. Once rights are granted to anyone, to take them away incites fury. I suppose an attempt to restore Apartheid would lead to some sort of civil war which blacks would win (numbers on their side). Its better to live alongside each other in equality, than to live apart in a caste system.</p>

		<p>This is only considered unusual by whites and other civilized peoples. How old is the average black child before he or she is raped? Do Africans even concieve of the notion of &#8220;consent?&#8221; South Africa&rsquo;s president surely doesn&rsquo;t. <br>
The notion that women and girls are anything other than a man&rsquo;s property is a EUROPEAN invention. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to stick with most other cultures. </p>
