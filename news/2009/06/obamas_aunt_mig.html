<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Aunt Might (Or Might Not) Return to Kenya</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Bridis, AP, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s aunt who is fighting to remain in the U.S. says she might or might not be heading to Kenya before her next deportation hearing. Such a trip could affect her immigration case.</p>
<p>Zeituni Onyango (zay-TUH&rsquo;-nee awn-YAHN&rsquo;-goh) has been living illegally in the U.S. for years. She told the Boston Globe on Wednesday that she would return to Kenya as soon as that evening, but then said she wasn&rsquo;t going. Even if she did leave, she said she planned to be in Boston for her immigration hearing on Feb. 4.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If a person has an application or a petition for a benefit such as asylum, and that person leaves the country without notifying the federal government, the person is effectively abandoning the petition, a homeland security official told The Associated Press. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In April, a U.S. immigration judge in Boston set Onyango&rsquo;s case to be heard Feb. 4, giving her until at least next year to make her bid for asylum from her native Kenya. Onyango, 56, first applied for asylum in 2002, but her request was rejected and she was ordered deported in 2004. She did not leave the country and continued to live in public housing in Boston.</p>
<p>Obama has said he did not know his aunt was living here illegally and believes laws covering the situation should be followed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Oh God, we&rsquo;re all on pins and needles wondering- - will she decide to stay here where EVERYTHING is given to her and everything runs efficiently, or will she decide to return to her beloved Kenya where she can live in a fly infested shanty, dodge bullets, and chase down her daily meals. I&rsquo;m personally at the edge of my chair wondering- - WHAT WILL HER DECISION BE!!!!! </p>

		<p>Obama seems to be in a no-win situation on this one. On one hand, if his aunt stays, he will be accused of helping her and showing favoratism (although favoratism to one&rsquo;s family is normal and expected). However, if she ends up being deported, he&rsquo;ll be blasted for abandoning his family. &#8220;Derned if you do, derned if you don&rsquo;t&#8221; as my grandfather would say it. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t much respect the Democrats or Obama, but why make a big deal out of his old aunt? She is no different from every other illegal alien in America, in that, &#8220;SHE&#8221; will decide when she&rsquo;s good and ready to go back to where she came from  &mdash;  U.S. Immigration law and ICE be damned.</p>

		<p>I help support my aunt. Doesn&rsquo;t Obama support his? He&rsquo;s a millionaire, after all. </p>

		<p>&#8220;der fuehrer&rsquo;s&#8221; (oops I mean obama&rsquo;s) roots in islam are starting to show. <br>
His &#8220;gaffes&#8221; about &#8220;his muslim religion&#8221; and the &#8220;57 (islamic) states were not &#8220;gaffes&#8221; at all.  They showed his true mindset and intentions.  <br>
His &#8220;apology tours&#8221; will only make America weaker in the eyes of the world.  He is &#8220;setting us up&#8221; for a &#8220;one world government&#8221;.<br>
Maybe he is keeping his &#8220;auntie&#8221; here to keep her from speaking out about the &#8220;messiah&rsquo;s&#8221; (oops I mean obama&rsquo;s) origins and foreign &#8220;citizenship&#8221;.  He would throw is &#8220;auntie&#8221; &#8220;under the bus&#8221; if she started to &#8220;talk&#8221;.<br>
Patriots, ACT when the time comes.</p>

		<p>If you ever wonder about why there are so many homeless in America, this is the answer.  An illegal alien under a deportation order living in government housing for years while native born Americans are denied government housing.</p>
<p>According to the viciously anti American and pro illegal alien Los Angeles Times, 60 percent of government housing in Los Angeles is occupied by illegal aliens.</p>
