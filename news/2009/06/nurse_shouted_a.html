			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hospital nurse shouted at an elderly woman and stripped her naked in front of other patients, a hearing has been told.</p>
<p>Memory Musekiwa is accused of pushing the pensioner, who had wet herself, onto a commode in full view and then refusing to wash her.</p>
<p>If she is found guilty of the &#8216;brutal&rsquo; behaviour, the 35-year-old could be struck off the nursing register.</p>
<p>The patient, who was in her late seventies, &#8216;cried and cried&rsquo; following the incident at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard.</p>
<p>She cannot be named and during the hearing was referred to only as Patient A.</p>
<p>Musekiwa, from Walsall, West Midlands, shouted, removed the woman&rsquo;s nightdress and then left her with no curtain around her, said Salim Hafejee for the NMC.</p>
<p>&#8216;She then pushed Patient A on to a commode and told her to stay there while she went to get a mop,&rsquo; he told the panel.</p>
<p>&#8216;When Patient A asked to be washed, she refused and put a clean nightdress on her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;She failed to appropriately deal with a patient who found herself in a situation where she could not help herself. She did not protect this patient&rsquo;s dignity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fellow patient Julie Owen sobbed as she told the misconduct panel that she had been woken by the elderly woman asking for help that night, before hearing the nurse telling the patient off.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then she took Patient A&rsquo;s nightdress and underwear off and left her standing there while she went to fetch a mop and bucket,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;At no point were the curtains put around her. Her dignity was completely stripped. There was no delicacy. No bowl was brought to wash Patient A with.</p>
<p>&#8216;There was no cleanliness. She had wet herself and the nurse was putting clean clothes on an unclean body. I clearly heard Patient A say to her &#8220;don&rsquo;t be so brutal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;After the nurse had gone Patient A just sat on her bed and cried and cried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Musekiwa was reported to the NMC after Miss Owen made a complaint at the hospital in Worcester the next day.</p>
<p>The nurse is accused of shouting at the elderly woman, failing to promote her dignity, pushing her on to a commode and refusing to wash her.</p>
<p>She admits stripping the patient naked without closing the curtains around her in the early hours of November 12 2007, but denies the other charges against her.</p>

		<p>This is far more common than most whites think.  The vast majority of people employed in the care of elderly are minorities.  And, they are vastly among the uneducated, angry kind.  From my personal experience, the majority of minorities do their best to belittle or humiliate whites when they are in a position of power.  Sometimes, white people are just too ignorant to see or believe it is race-based.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine how much worse this will get when we are the minority? </p>
<p>Furthermore, the nurse should be deported whence she came. If the races were revered can you imagine the outcry? The MSM would NEVER let us here the end of it. </p>
<p>Hopefully with the BNP in place they can actually begin cleaning up this mess with NHS! The BNP has reported that conditions and mandated AA quotas from &ldquo;foreign countries&rdquo; and the patient care has gone down hill because of it. Not to mention the ought right abuse of funds and mismanagement all the way around. <br>

		<p>Musekiwa, from Walsall, West Midlands,</p>
<p>Identifying this woman as if she were a native Brit is disgusting, as is the conduct of all the blacks in the Emerald Isles. Deportation is the answer.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had first-hand experience with Blacks like her.  It&rsquo;s really an old story; just give them a little power.  They do whatever they like, even in a hospital setting because no one challenges them, everyone is afraid of looking racist.  They especially enjoy humiliating White people, most especially helpless old ones who can&rsquo;t defend themselves.  </p>
<p>I have a friend who was attacked on the street by a pack of Blacks.  When the ambulance came and treated him - he had a broken nose and various cuts - the Black ambulance driver asked if the kids that had attacked him were Black.  She asked him, &#8220;Were they Black&#8221;,  smiling all the while.  This was an ambulance person, Can you believe it?  As our country sinks closer and closer to the third world status that awaits it and as an awakened White person, I ask myself - how much longer can we let this go on?  How much longer can we tolerate this?</p>

		<p>Far too common, I am afraid - so much for the great welfare state.  I am english, am ashamed my country has been brought to this, it is really going bad here, you can see it with your very eyes, and i tell you that i&rsquo;d rather be dead than be that patient&rsquo;s same age in england in the future (now 27, so fifty years later) - what will it be like - horror, and people will not know any different by then and think it is the norm, just as in Orwell people thuoght that totalitarian life was the norm, though people had glimpses of a somewhat kinder and softer past.   Cannot believe what has happened to england, anyone with good sense is fleeing, though if there was a promising stand against all this, this invasion, then many would flock to it (i am afraid a democratic stand seems impotent in the face of what it is up against), but there is no concrete environemt in which this is to develop, too many english themselves are eloping with these aliens and being brainwashed, our institutions being swarmed with them, and it all points in one direction - total containemnt and then biological wipeout for the truly indigenous of England.</p>
<p>(Even in most of our public libraries your website is blocked, and people shun me for using it if i mention as i am &#8220;racist&#8221; for doing so, though your website for the most part is made up mainstream articles supporting what i think is your sound and reasonable stance which you should have a right to - its a totalitarian state here</p>

		<p>You want to be very careful how many blacks are around hospitals, old-age homes, assisted-care facilities etc. They are in a position of power, particularly power over Whites and you are at their mercy. Believe me you want a place with as few blacks as possible. I know this from my own personal experience with my family members.</p>

<p>Every public library has to have a least one unfiltered computer for adults to use.  The CofCC helped the litigation that saw to that:</p>

<p>Use the contact form on that page and state the nature of your problem, and someone will eventually get to you.  All it will take is one letter sent to the library, and your problem will be solved.</p>

		<p>Non-whites already make up a significant percentage of healthcare workers in the United States and Europe. It will grow larger unfortunately. </p>
<p>I feel great pity for white people who can&rsquo;t afford quality long-term care facilities for their aging parents and releatives. Just the thought of having to stick a loved one in a state-run home at the mercy of vengful, theiving and uncompassionate non-whites makes me want to reciprocate such behavior. </p>
<p>I mention this because state- run facilities, unlike hospitals, are usually off-radar and potential for abuse can be off the charts.</p>
<p>Please do all you can to keep loved ones out of such places.</p>

		<p>Blacks should never be allowed to work in hospitals or nursing homes where there are white people.</p>
<p>They have a constant hate-rage barely below the surface that is based on the propaganda that whites are the reasons they can&rsquo;t get ahead.</p>
<p>We can thank the white leftists and the black charletans for that mostly, because they control the black mobs, the media and most universities and schools, and it is they who promote the idea that blacks have just as much ability as whites, which covers up the fact that blacks just aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough, nor do they have other abilities necessary, to compete in a first world country.</p>
<p>Combine the attitude that they&rsquo;re being held down, with their natural arrogance that blinds them to their own lack of intellect, and a recipe for rage and disaster is always present wherever they are.</p>

		<p>The abused patient wasn&rsquo;t just elderly. She also must have been very sick or she wouldn&rsquo;t have been staying overnight. That nurse should not only be removed from nursing but charged with assault and battery, as well. I&rsquo;m not familiar with British law but American law has stiffer penalties for assault and battery against senior citizens.</p>

<p>Are there decent Black folks out there?  Yes, there certainly are.  However, for every Black that is decent in every way, there seems to be about a ten that are on the verge of being a criminal.  I do not exaggerate, but my experiences are narrowed to mid-size cities in the South so the true numbers are sure to be a little different.</p>

		<p>My wife, father and uncle were subject to racial maltreatment in hospital in the UK. It is the norm for African and Asian staff to be rude, aggressive, uncaring and rough with indiginous Britons.</p>
<p>If you complain - as I did - you get stonewalled and it is made quite clear that YOU will be accussed of racism if you pursue a complaint.</p>
<p>It is for reasons like this that so many Britons now vote BNP.</p>

		<p>The comment from GetBackJack is right on the money.</p>
<p>I saw it from the inside out.  About 20 yrs ago, I was a certified nurse&rsquo;s aide, and did it for a number of years until I felt like I was the last white person who did the job.<br>
The only patients blacks treat well are their own, so I made sure that my white patients got top-notch care from me (not that I gave any of my patients short-shrift).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of not-so-good things, so if you&rsquo;ve family members being cared for by any minority, be extra vigilant.  Get them there own (white) private-duty aide or move them somewhere else.</p>

		<p>I saw this at a nursing home where an inlaw was staying. </p>
<p>We had to insist the staff who attended to him be changed as the &#8220;woman of color&#8221; who worked on his floor was an obnoxious bully. Thankfully, we got him out of that place in a week.</p>
<p>This sort of situation is worse on the night shift, where there aren&rsquo;t many supervisors or family members around to limit patient abuse.</p>
<p>What are these so-called &#8220;care-givers&#8221; angry about? Well, in our state, welfare requires recepients to work 20 hours a week and that is 20 hours too many for them.</p>

		<p>Thousands of overseas nurses on student nurse visas could be illegally staying in the UK. The nurses have come to this country for adaptation training or Supervised Placement on the Overseas Nurses Programme (ONP), which is run by the NMC in conjunction with universities, hospitals, and nursing homes. The problem is that there are insufficient places for all the nurses currently in the UK. Last year Immigration Matters reported that up to 37000 nurses were in the UK seeking adaptation places, at a time when only a fraction of training places were actually available. As nurses are given visas to enter the UK on the understanding that they have a training place, this problem should not arise. The reality is that many are promised training places which fail to materialise or are told to wait several months upon arrival. Unscrupulous agents and fixers also create bogus places, for which they charge exorbitant fees, leaving nurses to fend for themselves once they arrive in the UK. I have seen numerous cases of nurses from India, Nigeria and The Philippines who paid large sums of money to overseas agents for supervised placements or adaptation places which do not exist.</p>

Robert,<br>
As an Euro- American I too am concerned with what&rsquo;s going on here in the USA but I&rsquo;m also concerned about the continent from where my ancestors came. I can&rsquo;t explain why White people simply accept their own extinction. It&rsquo;s almost as though we&rsquo;ve been conditioned through mind control. I hear that some 20,000 ethnic English are leaving the country every year. Is that true? I don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re going that&rsquo;s any better. Australia is having it&rsquo;s problems as is Canada.<br>
We need to go to DEFCON-5 as they say in the military. WE need to raise our consciousness about race as does every non- White and begin to defend ourselves.</p>

		<p>This story made me want to cry.  My own mother was in two different nursing homes this past year after a stroke.  I sometimes wondered about the care she and the other patients got when we were not around, and now she is home, I can only hope the home nurse is kind and good to her.  I am thinking of putting a camera in to see.  I believe had I seen anything amiss at the nursing homes, there would have been hell to pay.  Seriuosly, it seems there are people attracted to this job, because they need very little education, and can slack off on the job, and the patients usually are unable to speak up, or are brushed off as being senile. </p>

		<p>Our elderly have worked hard all their lives and deserve our support. I&rsquo;ve always said that taking care of the elderly should be a career, a much higher paying job where people who do it must have a community college degree. If this were true, you&rsquo;d have better care and a higher quality of people and less of this type of thing. The problem is cheap labor on the part of nursing homes.</p>

&#8220;I know of an 89 year-old white woman and social security recipient who wet herself and was denied water by Mexican &ldquo;nurses&rdquo; for five days in a Santa Ana nursing home. She lost consciousness, was hospitalized, and died one day later.&#8221; </p>
<p>I have to take a second bite at the apple and comment again, since I&rsquo;ve seen this type of situation happen before.<br>
I was team leader on the evening shift when a patient (whom I knew to be white) repeatedly rang her call bell  &mdash;  -and I witnessed her Mexican aide entering the room just long enough to turn off the bell and leave the room.<br>
I went to check on the patient myself (who was in tears) and  &mdash;  -you guessed it  &mdash;  -denial of water.  I was furious with the Mexican aide who insisted that the patient was lying!<br>
Although I reported this to the higher-ups, not a thing was ever done about it. <br>
This was not a run-down joint.  It was a facility for the absolute very wealthy, and these rich families thought that the Mexican aides were just oh, so nurturing with their loved ones.  </p>

		<p> Many of these places do the minimum necessary to keep the old ones alive so they can collect their $4K/month per breathing inmate.  It&rsquo;s much better to die at home, alone even, than surrounded by indifferent or hostile strangers.  Let your estate go to your family, or AmRen, rather than a nursing home/warehouse.</p>

		<p>True story from one of the *top* hospitals in the USA:<br>
  Another woman (in the next room) and I found out we had had the same surgery on the same day. We were scheduled to have a three day hospital stay. That first night we saw the night-shift nurses, looked at each other, and said (without actually saying it) that we&rsquo;d stay up all night and &#8220;party&#8221; until the day shift came. We watched Turner Classics, ate ice chips, wheeled our iv&rsquo;s down the halls&hellip;<br>
  When the day nurse came back on duty, it was obvious I was tired  &mdash;  hadn&rsquo;t slept at all. She asked why, and I told her, &#8220;Nurse So-and-So&#8221;. She replied, nodding her head, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve heard that before&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;If Obamacare passes you will be seeing a lot more of this here in America. Once the UK passed government-run healthcare nursing salaries dropped and third-worlders had to be brought in to fill the jobs. The same thing will happen here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said the same thing. Nursing here in texas pays a good wage and most of the nurses are professional and do a good job and they make good money. However, with &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll want to cut salaries for nurses to the bone to save money and we&rsquo;ll get a bunch of lousy third world nurses and pay them much less and healthcare will go down the tubes. You&rsquo;ll see a big rise in third world cheaper doctors. You&rsquo;ll see huge lines of people waiting for healthcare. The rich and the politicians will have their own private healthcare. There will be long lines of fast breeding mexicans and the average white american will die waiting to see a doctor. Yes, I realize that our current healthcare is far too expensive, good but very expensive and we need some major changes but not the Obama kind of change which will be an overburdened, third world staffed public healthcare nightmare.<br>

		<p>There are some out there who will detect Schadenfreude in what I&rsquo;m about to say. I stress that I take no pleasure in saying this, but the sex, drugs, and rock and roll people who  demonstrated and bombed university science departments to show their support for the Vietcong, will be tomorrow&rsquo;s nursing home residents.</p>

<p>Elder abuse makes me sick. If anyone did that to either of my parents, I would physically retaliate and take my chances with a jury.<br>
========================================================</p>
<p>Sadly thats just bravado.<br>
You see, the jury, drawn from the average american population - would be filled with self serving minorities (as most of them are) or brainwashed self serving white liberals or limp 90% liberal conservatives (as most of them are).</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll end up in a Jail cell with that Nurse Mercy&rsquo;s half brother. If you think the women are violent&hellip;wait till you get to know the men.</p>
