			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>By Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Aiming to accelerate the integration of immigrants into Southern California life, a leading California foundation will announce today that it is issuing $900,000 in grants to help ease conflicts between blacks and Latinos in Pasadena, promote worker rights in Artesia, organize to bring supermarkets to minority neighborhoods and other initiatives.</p>
<p>The grants represent the first outlays in the California Community Foundation&rsquo;s five-year, $3.75-million initiative to help immigrants learn English, improve job skills, increase civic participation and build trust with African Americans and other residents.</p>
<p>Foundation President Antonia Hernandez said immigrants, who make up nearly half the Los Angeles workforce and contribute 40% of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s gross regional product, were essential to the broader society&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six of the grants were aimed at increasing cross-cultural collaboration to solve community problems. Hernandez said they reflected one of the foundation&rsquo;s aims: to help minimize conflicts between immigrants and long-standing residents.</p>
<p>Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice of California, a grass-roots alliance of faith leaders, is set to receive $100,000 to build ties among evangelical Latino pastors, evangelical white ministers in Orange County and African American faith leaders in South Los Angeles. The Rev. Alexia Salvatierra, the alliance director, said immigrant pastors have shared stories about the wrenching impact of deportations on families, while African Americans have described the pain of violence among their youth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Artesia, the South Asian Network plans to use its $100,000 to launch efforts to bring together Latino and South Asian workers to press for labor rights. {snip}</p>
<p>The grant will help break down isolation between workers of different cultures, develop multilingual material, bring in legal aid and launch an oral history project.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, the Thai Community Development Corp. will receive $160,000 to help the polyglot neighborhood become an active player in influencing the massive developments planned there. The area&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  which is 57% foreign-born and whose top native languages are Spanish, Russian, Armenian, Korean and Tagalog  &mdash;  could be significantly affected by at least a dozen major developments in the works, including the planned Museum of the Motion Picture on Vine Street and Fountain Avenue, said Chancee Martorell, the Thai center&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
<p>The grant will help the Thai center organize the community to work with developers for affordable housing, open space, local hiring, protection of small shops and other benefits, Martorell said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other major grant recipients include the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which will receive $120,000 for work easing conflicts between Latinos and African Americans in northwest Pasadena. The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy will get $200,000 to help communities develop supermarkets and jobs in South and East Los Angeles and Sylmar and Pacoima.</p>
<p>The YMCA of Greater Long Beach will receive $120,000 to help increase educational opportunities for immigrant and African Americans youth.</p>
<p>In addition, four other groups will get $25,000 grants each to increase immigrants&rsquo; access to services. {snip}</p>

Why is it with minorities that it takes extra resources to even approach the standards of whites?</p>
<p>When whites are left alone, they thrive. When blacks and hispanics are left alone, they implode.</p>

		<p>Funny, when white right-wingers commit a hate crime, once in every ten years, I am not aware that there are a bevy of foundations, United Funds, basketball gyms and human rights do-badders showering money on white people, wanting to &#8220;integrate&#8221; them into the community with opportunities aplenty and grocery store jobs.</p>
<p>The only thing they get are one &#8220;poverty center&#8221; and &#8220;defamation league&#8221; after another, and the selfsame human rights do-badders mentioned above, whining about vast conspiracies.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there will soon be &#8220;integration&#8221; of a community in Southern California.  It&rsquo;ll all be Hispanic, their having driven everybody else away.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Foundation President Antonia Hernandez said immigrants, who make up nearly half the Los Angeles workforce and contribute 40% of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s gross regional product, were essential to the broader society&rsquo;s well-being.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes and they likely take three times that much in welfare, medicaid, food stamps etc., while employers get the cheap labor and Americans have to pay for all these low income people with their taxes. If you consider increased crime, welfare usage and racial tensions between various groups a sign of well-being, than yes they increase society&rsquo;s well-being. By the way, if these immigrants are so economically beneficial, why is California very broke?</p>
<p>&#8220;In Artesia, the South Asian Network plans to use its $100,000 to launch efforts to bring together Latino and South Asian workers to press for labor rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is coming next. Do these employers think that the wage slaves they hire are going to stay that way? When the numbers and power of them gets large enough or if amnesty is granted, they&rsquo;ll understandably start demanding higher wages and better working conditions. Their(employers) desire for cheap docile labor will go right out the window. Oh well, then the employers will cry &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; and want more illegals.</p>

		<p>Who or what gave the money to the foundation?</p>
<p>Of course a big theoretical hurdle here is that in order to build alliances and dialogue between the various groups you first have to stereotype the members of each group into an average experience. Then bridges can be built across the different average experiences of the groups. Within groups the individuals can bond around their group average experience. But stereotyping is also considered to be wrong by these same social justice lobbyists because it detracts from individuality and often the stereotype is not true for an individual. So who is going to decide when it is appropriate to stereotype people and who decides how to define these average experiences? Notice how the whole process plays to the non-rational mind and they just love to work with children. It&rsquo;s difficult to see how the program can be made democratic and subject to honest social debate. These are the hallmarks of text-book fascism.  Again we see that multiculturalism is a form of fascism. </p>

<p>Artesia, eh?<br>
Nice.<br>
Like an artesian well? Crystaline clear refreshment and a swelling up of abundance? Lovely.<br>
How&rsquo;s this coming about again?<br>
Oh. Grants.<br>
I wont spend any time commenting on how foreign the idea of &#8220;grants&#8221; is to us.<br>
I also wont spend any time commenting on how futile (and corrupt)it is to expect non material gains from material causation.<br>
When confronted with absurdity, my Anglo Saxon mind naturally joins in on the fun.<br>
As such, I will now take a two-year language course to learn Mandarin. Then I will &#8220;write&#8221;* a grant.<br>
Then I will travel to the mighty Sahara<br>
and with bottle after bottle of sparkling Perrier Water,<br>
I will flood the region with life giving (and French!) water,<br>
Irradiate it with my roseate aura and cause plant life to flourish.<br>
and in the end,<br>
Kubla Khan will envy me.<br>
[ game-set-match ]</p>
<p>Absurd you say?<br>
Yes of course. I was only following the neural pattern of my ancestors. <br>
The problem is that persons of the sort who compose and execute the Grand Designs of the California Community Foundation (et al) are ALSO following the (thinking) patterns of their ancestors, and they are NOT joking, and their paths all lead to the desert. <br>
Just as they always have.<br>
Anyone wishing to assist me in my quest will please chime in with any advise or council you may offer.<br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><br>
[sorry, by the way, hasnt this sort of thing been tried and tried repeatedly and uncountably throughout the past century or so and always resulted in the same disaster and/or nullity? -just asking.]</p>
<p>*One does not &#8220;Apply For&#8221; a grant. One &#8220;Writes&#8221; a grant.<br>
To &#8216;apply for&rsquo; one, or even to include the words (oops! &#8220;Verbiage&#8221;&hellip;sorry!) merits immediate rejection.<br>
&gt;this concludes Lesson One of Mandarin English 101.<br>

		<p>Even the socialist idiot who wrote &#8220;Fast Food Nation,&#8221; correctly depicted the disastrous consequences when swarms of illegals invade a once stable community. (While keeping the illegals at moral center stage, of course!)<br>
Even Cesar Chavez was anti illegal immigration. He felt that illegals destroyed Mexican&rsquo;s bargaining power in the work place. I read somewhere that he snitched on illegals and helped the MIGRA root them out.</p>

		<p>Oh well, then the employers will cry &ldquo;labor shortage&rdquo; and want more illegals.</p>
<p>But NEXT time, the cheap labor will be Indians (from INDIA) and muslims from Africa to begin the process all over. Just ask Tyson foods how well african muslims work out.</p>

		<p>If multiculturalism is such a blessing to the west, or as the left advocates, &#8221; our greatest strength &#8220;, then why does it cost millions of our taxpayer dollars to implement? </p>
<p>&#8220;easing conflicts between blacks and latinos in Pasadena&#8221;<br>
&#8220;teaching immigrants English, improve job skills, inrease civic participation, and build trust with african Americans and others&#8221;</p>
<p>Im sorry, but this doesnt sound like a strenghth to me at all, and definately not our greatest strength. The quotes are lists of problems created directly from multiculturalism- Racial conflict, unskilled workers, no sencse of civic responsibility, the lack of the ability to communicate in English, and apparently african Americans who dont trust us.</p>
<p>It would be good to point out that these problems are not the problems of the native born White Americans. We get along quite well with each other, have industriously skilled workers, the greatest sencse of civic responsibility, speak English as our native tounge, and dont have to worry about who does or doesnt trust us as a group</p>
<p>The holes in the marxist idea are apparant to me, even with the propaganda campain created to make you believe that bad is good, diversity is strength, slavery is freedom. Just rediculous. </p>
<p>This grant is money spent on the enormous problems created directly by the disaster of multiculturalism. Greatest strenght? I think it would be more accurate to say it is the greatest threat that we face as a nation, and as a distinct people. </p>

		<p>Skip&hellip;that is why I don&rsquo;t buy Tyson food products..</p>
<p>Neither Zacky Farm products or&hellip;&hellip;..the list goes on.</p>
<p>There is not much left in America that one can buy without the fingerprints of these foreigners tainting the products. Yes, I mean foreigners! I don&rsquo;t care what our government and others call them. You know the drill, legal citizens, legal immigrants, illegals, resident aliens, etc. Since 1965 this nation has been on a downward spiral into a 3rd world status and that means all the &#8220;trimmings&#8221; that go with it.</p>
