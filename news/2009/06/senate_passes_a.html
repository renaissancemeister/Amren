<h1>Senate Passes Apology for Slavery, Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, June 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Senate has unanimously passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and racial segregation and sent the measure to the House.</p>
<p>Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin first introduced the measure years ago but wanted it passed Thursday on the eve of Juneteenth  &mdash;  a day of celebration commemorating the end of the Civil War and the release of African Americans from slavery. He said the House is to take it up soon and that a formal celebration will be held next month in the Capitol Rotunda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The resolution passed Thursday includes a disclaimer saying that nothing in it supports or authorizes reparations by the United States.<br>

		<p>I would have thought that the near one million white lives lost in abolishing slavery in US would have been enough,and perhaps some reperations to those famileis might now be in order,and not to mention the wars with the moslem slave traders.-No mention of moslem slave trade. T.Jefferson,and Lincoln are turning in their graves&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Ok fine&hellip;.Now where is the apology to me (a Native Born White Male) for all of the discrimination that has happened to me as a result of Affirmative Action?</p>
<p>The way I see it is that a white male usually winds up one step below where he really should be in a fair society.  Meanwhile, most minorities end up one step ahead of where they should be.</p>
<p>I am sick of this nonsense.  </p>

		<p>Americans, especially the US Congress, need to read Michael Hoffmans&rsquo; &#8220;They Were White and They Were Slaves&#8221; to get the full and real picture of slavery in America.  White slaves were here before black slaves ever arrived!  They need to be included in<br>
any reference or apology for slavery in America!</p>

		<p>Alexander Stewart was herded off the Gildart in July of 1747, bound with chains.  Stewart was pushed onto the auction block in Wecomica, St Mary&rsquo;s County, Maryland.Doctor Stewart and his brother William were attending the auction, aware of Alexander being on that slave ship coming from Liverpool England.  Doctor Stewart and William were residents of Annapolis and brothers to David of Ballachalun in Montieth, Scotland.  The two brothers paid nine pound six shillings sterling to Mr. Benedict Callvert of Annapolis for the purchase of Alexander.  He was a slave.  Alexander tells of the other 88 Scots sold into slavery that day in &ldquo;THE LYON IN MOURNING&rdquo; pages 242-243.<br>

White slaves (the word slave comes from slavic) were sold on the SAME block as blacks and were enslaved before them. Where&rsquo;s their apology? </p>

		<p>What trucklers these senators are. Slavery was never a national institution, but based upon the residual,or  reserved powers in the constitution. The congress did permit slavery in the District of Columbia, but never in the country as a whole. Indeed, it lacked that power short of a constitutional amendment.As to reparations, the government has been paying those for years, in the form of welfare, affirmative action and business set asides, and it continues to do so.  </p>

		<p>God help us! No wonder no one respects white people. All they do is grovel and apologize for something they never had anything to do with. It is meaningless and pointless. It is over and done! For crying out loud. </p>
<p>And furthermore, what about apologizing for WHITE SLAVERY in this country? Huh? It did occur. I think every white person in the USA should send these sniveling little corrupt useless and worthless corrupt so called representatives this link: http://www.epado.bravehost.com/whiteslaves00.htm and demand an apology. Matter of fact also send it to the NAACP and tell them to stick that in pipe in smoke it. Ya, think? </p>
<p>And what the heck is &ldquo;Juneteenth&rdquo; day? I am really! Talk about bastardization of a word, well &ldquo;Juneteenth&rdquo; would be it.  <br>

		<p>Is this really a top priority of this nation while so many Americans are having a tough time with a failing economy and an idiot in the white house? I mean really, this is rediculous. I am a law abiding, tax paying, God fearing, combat veteran who was recently medically discharged from the Army due to wounds sustained during my second tour in Afghanistan, and try as I may, I am having a difficult time finding a good job and providing for my wife and three children. I expect no handouts or special treatment nor do I want to take away from a non-military family. Without rambling, we are among thousands of honest, hard working Americans looking for work in a less than ideal situation concerning our nation and her industries. <br>
Meanwhile, I see no appologies from the black community for years of crime, welfare abuses, affermative action biases, rapes, murders, robberies, dumbing down of our public schools to carry blacks, riots, and general lawlessness that has led to white flight to escape all of these wonderful benefits of forced integration under the &#8220;diversity&#8221; banner.<br>
I have never owned slaves, nor do I condone it, but you will never hear an appology from me for a very small population of plantation owners 200 years ago who did. For the last time, GET OVER IT! I come from Irish immigrants who were annother group who were discriminated against and made to work in squalid conditions for pennies a day and do you think anyone will say they are sorry for the things my ancestors had to go through? Absolutely not. Nor do I expect it. <br>
I think there are hundreds of issues that take priority over this bill and I also think congress should be working on these issues instead of trying to appease a demographic that has proved time and time again to be nothing but a cancer to this once great nation. One thing I am sorry about is the mistake made by bringing hordes of these animals over here long ago. This was a mistake we having been trying to deal with ever since. </p>

		<p>Conveniently, it was a voice vote.  We won&rsquo;t know who voted which way, save the yes votes by the usual suspects.</p>
<p>The CBC is showing their naivete here.  It does not matter that the resolution says no reparations.  Just pass the resolution, get Sotomayor on SCOTUS and several years of Obama&rsquo;s judicial picks for lower Federal courts, then file a lawsuit.  The Federal judiciary will come through for the left like the usually do.</p>
<p>Or maybe the CBC knows this, and they&rsquo;re being Machiavellian, and tricking whites in to voting for it.</p>
<p>Irish Pride:</p>
<p>Your people were made to work in squalid conditions that were only barely above slavery while the budding northeastern industrial elite said slavery was bad and we had to get rid of it, and the invasion they feted tricked your people into plugging themselves into a meat grinder in order to pound The South for about the last year and a half of the war, because the enemy had nothing close to a brilliant military strategist, unlike the good guys.</p>

		<p>Pretty ridiculous, especially given the fact that only a tiny sprinkling of individuals in the &#8216;white&rsquo; community have ancestors who actually owned slaves. I doubt that even one of the &#8216;whites&rsquo; who voted on the bill can count any such ancestors in their family line. In fact, I would bet that most of them haven&rsquo;t even been here since before the War Between the States, let alone count former slaveholders in their family tree. The majority of &#8216;whites&rsquo; in the present day United States are post-Civil War arrivals. What&rsquo;s the point of giving apologies when they aren&rsquo;t even coming from those who actually had a part in the whole matter?</p>

		<p>They will sneak reparations in any bill that is going to pass just like they will slip in amnesty to millions and their families.</p>
<p> If White America does nothing when the traitors do this, then I say those Whites do not deserve to live on and they have condemned their offspring to eternal hell. Shame on all of them! I, at least speak out and my family knows exactly where I stand when it comes to racial issues and this multicult hell we call America.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Senate has unanimously passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and racial segregation and sent the measure to the House.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote a letter to the Senate informing them that I want to be excluded in their apology to blacks for slavery.</p>
<p>Since myself and none of my ancestors owned slaves, and since the blacks today were never, ever slaves I don&rsquo;t want to be included in an assinine declaration that is based in nonsense and stupidity.</p>
<p>And, so far as segregation is concerned, I&rsquo;m presently in favor of that, so I would hardly want to apologize.</p>
<p>In fact, I would like to have segregation returned to this country, because blacks have committed so many egregious crimes of violence and theft against whites I don&rsquo;t believe they are evolved enough on the scale of human development to live in any first class civilization in history.</p>
<p>Further, I would ask that the federal government award all whites at least a billion dollars each for having to endure the criminality, disruptions and chaos caused by blacks during our entire life on earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready, willing and able to present my case and prove its validity beyond a shadow of doubt.</p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s the Apology and Reparataions for anti-Irish Discrimination that was rampant in the U.S.? </p>
<p>I remember hearing from many of my older Relatives about signs that said,&#8221; No Irish Need Apply&#8221;. </p>
<p>So, America, where is the aplology to the Irish? You can bow to the Blacks, apologize to the Native Indians, and even apologize to the Japanese-Americans who were inturned in Camps, during World War II, but somehow the cat&rsquo;s got your tongue when it comes to the Irish.  </p>
<p>Is it because we are White? Think about the irony. </p>

		<p>Is the Senate going to apologize for the de facto segregation of their almost-all-white ritzy gated communities and the almost-all-white elite private schools where they send their scions? How about for their all white places of worship? </p>
<p>&#8220;Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced an inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth.&#8221;   &mdash;  - Thomas Jefferson, from &#8220;Notes on Virginia&#8221; </p>
<p>Jefferson was talking about English religious wars, but replace Christianity with phony Liberalism and his words speak to the same truth. <br>

		<p>Some blacks are still waiting for their 40 acres and a mule. Look at the graphic of the US on the demographic article posted today, and tell me why that shouldn&rsquo;t be in the Old South? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been too long for Back to Africa to realistically work. Maybe blacks should have leadership in a part of this country that they have the deepest roots in. A mule these days would be like some equipment or start up capitol for farms or small businesses, like blacks once operated for themselves under Jim Crow segregation.</p>
<p>So much effort on meddling in the Third World instead of fixing problems inside our own country. I would rather send money to people in New Orleans than to Somalia. I would rather see factories built so that people have jobs on the Missisippi than in Mexico or Asia. </p>

		<p>Interesting concept, this.  America apologizes to present day black Africans because their distant ancestors were imported to this country as slaves, thus affording these present day black Africans the highest standard of living, and yes, outright privilege, enjoyed by any black Africans in the world.  And all this while inflicting the highest crime rate of any other group on America, the highest social, welfare, and other support costs of any other group, the utter destruction of every urban center they inhabit in significant numbers, and finally, awarding them enormous block-voting power and putting one of their own in the White House.</p>
<p>No doubt of it, we certainly owe them an apology.  Given all the clear damage we have inflicted on these people, the only means of making them whole would be repatriation to the African country of their choice.</p>
<p>What, you say they don&rsquo;t want to go?  Nonsense! It&rsquo;s the only way of making them whole after centuries of oppression.  </p>

Guess who pays to provide free health care to all the blacks living for free in US prisons- with free health care, while many innocent children have NO health care.

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, almost a million white men were killed in the Civil War; billions of taxpayer dollars have tried to &#8220;uplift&#8221; people out of poverty (mostly blacks, which in turn created ghettos and many fatherless children in the black community); and we now have elected a racist, militant, black president to this country.

		<p>  I said this before and I say it again: &ldquo;as a person who never owned slaves, I refuse to apologize to people who never were slaves.&rdquo;  As I recall, a bloody Civil War, a war in which over 600,000 whites perished, freed the slaves. Isn&rsquo;t that an apology in itself? </p>

<p>It sure was a waste of time! Not only were blacks &#8220;freed&#8221; many white farms, businesses and homes, many of whom were barely above poverty were destroyed by the same William T Sherman.

<p>White slaves (the word slave comes from slavic)&hellip;.</p>
<p>No, not really.  The word had an earlier and completely different meaning to the people who used the term for themselves much earlier.  The term in Western European usage arose from a later history for the people they fought against and took into forced servitude.  The mechanism of the development of the use of the term &#8220;Slav&#8221; to become Slave - is similar to how the drink name Coca Cola became univerally termed &#8220;Coke&#8221; for any cocca nut based soft drink.</p>
<p>I think that understanding terminology is important - espcially in this case because it reflects on White&rsquo;s understanding of their own history.</p>

<p>Word History: The derivation of the word slave encapsulates a bit of European history and explains why the two words slaves and Slavs are so similar; they are, in fact, historically identical. The word slave first appears in English around 1290, spelled sclave. The spelling is based on Old French esclave from Medieval Latin sclavus, &#8220;Slav, slave,&#8221; first recorded around 800. Sclavus comes from Byzantine Greek sklabos (pronounced sklävs) &#8220;Slav,&#8221; which appears around 580. Sklavos approximates the Slavs&rsquo; own name for themselves, the Slovnci, surviving in English Slovene and Slovenian. The spelling of English slave, closer to its original Slavic form, first appears in English in 1538. Slavs became slaves around the beginning of the ninth century when the Holy Roman Empire tried to stabilize a German-Slav frontier. By the 12th century stabilization had given way to wars of expansion and extermination that did not end until the Poles crushed the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410.·As far as the Slavs&rsquo; own self-designation goes, its meaning is, understandably, better than &#8220;slave&#8221;; it comes from the Indo-European root *kleu-, whose basic meaning is &#8220;to hear&#8221; and occurs in many derivatives meaning &#8220;renown, fame.&#8221; The Slavs are thus &#8220;the famous people.&#8221; Slavic names ending in -slav incorporate the same word, such as Czech Bohu-slav, &#8220;God&rsquo;s fame,&#8221; Russian Msti-slav, &#8220;vengeful fame,&#8221; and Polish Stani-slaw, &#8220;famous for withstanding (enemies</p>

		<p>Does anyone ever bring up the fact that there were black (african American) male and female slave owners in the ante-bellum south? Or is that subject not to be dealt with?</p>

		<p>The comments,and links on this subject have been some of the best I have ever seen on this subject.I would like to add one bit af American slave hitory that is not well known at all-This is the owning of black slaves by the certain Indian tribes&hellip;&hellip;When te Indians were removed from the southern states to Oklahoma(Trail of tears) they took with them their black slaves.The Cherokee tribe in Oklahoma,as well as the Eastern Cherokee have had to deal with this when determining who is a Cherokee,and recepiants of tribal money,citizenships etc.This is a current issue,and anyone interested shoule &#8220;Google&#8221; it up.By the way-I knew a Black/Cherokee girl once.She was one of the most beautiful gals I have ever know..Shemade me look good walking down the street..</p>

		<p>Another falsehood about slavery and the &#8220;south&#8221; is the image of the white &#8220;slaveowner&#8221; sitting on the porch of his antebellum southern &#8220;mansion&#8221; drinking pina coladas while his slaves were out working in the fields.  More often than not, the slaveowner was out in the fields working alongside his &#8220;charges&#8221;.  Survival was difficult for most in those days.<br>
FACT: there were MORE slaves in the NORTH than in the SOUTH.<br>
FACT: the &#8220;emancipation proclamation&#8221; only applied to the states that were in &#8220;rebellion&#8221;.  It did not apply to the rest of the states.</p>

		<p>32 Anon: Not only did the Emancipation Proclamation not apply to the slave-holding states of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, or Washington D.C., it did not apply to any place occupied by the Union Army.  That meant a great deal of Tennessee and more importantly, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, where slaves continued to pick cotton for their new Yankee Army masters based in New Orleans.   </p>

I want to hear our President apologize for the 50 years of atrocities that have been perpetrated against innocent White people by Blacks. I want to hear an apology for the murders, rapes, rape/murders, robberies, ad infinitum. I want to hear an apology to the parents of that poor 15 year old kid in Maryland who was beaten to death for &#8220;Bike riding while White&#8221; to use one of their lines to describe routine police stops or maybe an apology for the murders of the WHite family in Virginia where they slit the throats of little girls and boys for being White. How about the people in Wichita who were raped, sodomized and murdered for getting together while White, or the couple in Knoxville who were raped, sodomized and immolated for the crime of going out for an evening while White? Need I go on!!??? There isn&rsquo;t enough space to list even the most egregious of these attacks on Whites.</p>
<p>Mr. President, stand up in front of those TV Cameras of which you are so enamored and speak to YOUR fellow Afro-American people about what THEY need to do! Today is father&rsquo;s day. How about a special Presidential address to the Black males about their responsibilities. How about condemning self-annointed Black leaders like &#8220;Professor&#8221; Kambon who with absolute impunity calls for the extermination of White people from the earth and Quanell X who spews anti-White hatred every time he opens his ugly face.</p>

		<p> Reparations will be paid to blacks at some point in the future. For over forty years America has given in to their demands. The parent cannot say &#8220;no&#8221; to a hopelessly spoiled child.  The white race will only say no at a point where we have absolutely nothing left to give.</p>

		<p>Two conditions required for &#8220;reparations&#8221;.<br>
1.  Renounce US citizenship and relinquish US passport<br>
2.  Airline ticket (one-way) to an accepting country of your choice.</p>
