<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/08/bnp-legal-challenges">BNP Poll Win Brings Cash and Staff  &mdash;  and Legal Challenges Over Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Afua Hirsch and Matthew Taylor, Guardian (Manchester), June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The BNP will inevitably face a series of legal challenges on issues ranging from discrimination and employment law to possible criminal offences, lawyers say, following two candidates&rsquo; election to the European parliament.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s constitution, which says membership is &#8220;strictly defined within the terms of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;indigenous Caucasian&rsquo; and defined ethnic groups emanating from that Race&#8221; is a breach of the law against discriminating in membership organisations, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;An unincorporated association like the BNP which has genuine screening for membership cannot unlawfully discriminate,&#8221; said Gavin Millar QC, who specialises in election and discrimination law. &#8220;There will inevitably now be legal challenges to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was presumed before that the BNP were so unimportant that it wasn&rsquo;t worth trying, but now this is a live issue, and the BNP&rsquo;s constitution must be challenged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Possible challenges to the constitution could make use of a Lords ruling which found that political parties could be regarded as &#8220;members&rsquo; clubs&#8221; and therefore fell within discrimination law.</p>
<p>Lawyers also said that as the BNP gets access to the European parliament, with a budget for employing staff and contracting services, it would also be open to employment law, which prohibits direct and indirect discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black or Jewish candidate who applied and didn&rsquo;t get the job on grounds of their racial or religious background would have a claim in the employment tribunal,&#8221; Millar said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an individual challenges and they maintain a practice not employing any visible minority people, there is no doubt that like any employer who has such practices, they can be sued,&#8221; said employment barrister and chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, Peter Herbert. &#8220;When they are in receipt of public funds they will have to be an equal opportunities employer. To do otherwise would be incompatible with public office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see the equality commission mounting an inquiry into how the BNP operate now. The office of public standards could also inquire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The questions came as BNP leader Nick Griffin was pelted with eggs at an event in Manchester. Griffin picked up a seat in the north-west of England and Andrew Brons won a seat in Yorkshire and the Humber, a breakthrough in national elections for the far-right party.</p>
<p>Labour MEP for London Claude Moraes, speaking at a Unite Against Fascism press conference in Westminster, said: &#8220;There is real damage here to Britain because we have never elected fascists in a national election. Fascists in the European parliament have long wanted members from Britain to join this transnational group.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long period in which we could have said neofascists would not be elected in Britain to represent us in an international parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the BNP&rsquo;s membership and employment practices, lawyers said that policies once supported by the BNP but now abandoned by its official representatives  &mdash;  including non-voluntary repatriation and forced sterilisation of non-white women  &mdash;  may attract criminal liability for some BNP activists.</p>
<p>Said Millar: &#8220;One of the stresses for Nick Griffin is constantly having to say to the membership that this is no longer a policy they can espouse in public. It is a constant source of tension within the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Criminal lawyers said there was no doubt that members who espoused those policies could be liable for charges of inciting racial or religious hatred. &#8220;Any policy which incites racial hatred will be liable,&#8221; Herbert said. &#8220;Twelve years after Stephen Lawrence this is a sad place to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of BNP members already have criminal convictions for race-related offences, including Griffin, who was given a two-year suspended sentence for incitement to racial hatred after publishing material denying the Holocaust in 1998.</p>
<p>Although in 2006 Griffin and party activist Mark Collett were cleared of race hate charges relating to speeches he made describing Islam as a &#8220;wicked, vicious faith&#8221;, Griffin last month told BNP members in an online broadcast that he had no problem with breaking race laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, we don&rsquo;t break the law. We never have, we never will, you know, on financial things. Don&rsquo;t mind breaking the odd race law, or being accused of it, you know, inadvertently,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But lawyers said criminal convictions were difficult to obtain in practice, with an average of only three successful prosecutions per year for inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;[BNP activity] will only be criminal if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the material is threatening, abusive or insulting, and also it must be intended to stir up racial hatred,&#8221; said Kirsty Brimelow, a barrister who specialises in racial and religious hate crimes. &#8220;If BNP leaflets contain extreme racism, there will be a case that they are trying to undermine public order and the rights of the targeted minority  &mdash;  [so] they would not be able to rely on their right to free speech.&#8221;<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/09/nick-griffin-bnp-pelted-eggs">Nick Griffin Abandons BNP Press Conference Under Hail of Eggs</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Guardian (Manchester), June 9, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The BNP leader Nick Griffin was forced to abandon a press conference outside parliament today after protesters pelted him with eggs.</p>
<p>The demonstrators shouted &#8220;Off our streets, Nazi scum&#8221; and chased him down the street to his car.</p>
<p>Griffin, who was elected an MEP for north-west England on Sunday, was bundled into his car by his bodyguards and quickly drove off.</p>
<p>Having arrived for the press conference, on College Green in front of parliament, just after 2.30pm with fellow BNP MEP Andrew Brons, he began by attacking articles from today&rsquo;s newspapers criticising him and his party.</p>
<p>He had been speaking for only a few minutes when the protesters appeared, chanting and waving banners reading &#8220;Stop the fascist BNP&#8221;.</p>
<p>They threw eggs at Griffin, whose bodyguards quickly took him away through the crowd. The demonstrators kicked and hit his car with their placards before cheering as he drove off.</p>
<p>Weyman Bennett, the protest organiser and national secretary of Unite Against Fascism, said he believed it was important to stand up to the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of people did not vote for the BNP. They did not vote at all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The BNP was able to dupe them into saying that they had an answer to people&rsquo;s problems. They presented themselves as a mainstream party. The reality was, because the turnout was so low, they actually got elected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah Kavanagh, the Public and Commercial Services Union&rsquo;s national co-ordinator for its &#8220;make your vote count&#8221; campaign, was another of the protesters. &#8220;Britain in two places has sent the far right to be with Europe. They clearly don&rsquo;t speak on behalf of the community and their views are abhorrent,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said two people were taken to hospital after the protest. A spokeswoman said officers had received an allegation of common assault and were investigating reports of a road collision, but would not give further details.</p>
<p>Griffin later accused the three main parties of organising the protest to stop his party getting its message across. Griffin claims the BNP is not racist, even though it restricts membership to &#8220;indigenous British ethnic groups deriving from the class of &#8216;Indigenous Caucasian&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked yesterday how he could tell who qualified as British, Griffin said: &#8220;You just look and you just know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brons, the MEP for the Yorkshire and Humber region, told Sky news indigenous Britons were &#8220;the people of this country who were descended from people who were in this country, say, from the period after the second world war, when the country was relatively homogenous.&#8221;</p>
<p>All mainstream parties united in condemning the BNP after the party won two seats in the European parliament.</p>
<p>David Cameron, the Conservative leader, said yesterday the result was &#8220;desperately depressing&#8221; and the main parties had to win back those who had voted for the far-right party.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the mainstream parties have to do is prove their worth  &mdash;  get on the doorstep, explain to people how we are going to take up their concerns, how we are going to respond to their issues,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is the way to beat these dreadful people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Hain, the newly appointed Welsh secretary, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a shameful stain on Britain that we now have racists and fascists representing our country. It is vital that everyone now isolates and confronts the BNP and works with United Against Fascism to defeat them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP is to hold a press conference in Manchester tomorrow.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an easy way around that.  Don&rsquo;t ask for one&rsquo;s race on the BNP party membership application.  Therefore, you won&rsquo;t be discriminating based on who can join your party.  Now the convenient truth of the matter is that they&rsquo;ll hardly get any non-whites wanting to join, save the occasional troll who will only want to join to see if s/he will be rejected so that lawsuits can be brought.</p>

		<p>The only way you can really fight this kind of stuff is with a trong grassroots movement of Native English who will come to the support of the BNP. Either this happens or the Native English will face vicious persecution at the hands of non-whites.</p>
<p>The day is comming very soon for the Native English where the choice will be manifestly:fight back or die. The question the Native English will be forced to ask themselves is this:did I bring children into this world to be enslaved and brutalized. The issue at stake is genocide. The left, liberals and worshippers of the corporation have genocidal intentions towards the Native English.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve read it hundreds of times by conservative journalist&rsquo;s that liberalism is a disease of the mind. These so called multicultarist will tolerate anything but the white man.When the white man call foul or claim discrimination, they laugh, when the white man attempts to assert their rights they become violent and howl in fury when you respond in kind. It often reminds of a story where a school principal asked a boy &#8220;who started the fight? The boy&rsquo;s response was&#8221; He did when he hit me back.</p>

		<p>I have heard of this membership restriction rule so many times on British television as &#8216;proof&rsquo; the BNP is racist that I&rsquo;m thoroughly sick of it and wish the BNP would just drop the offending rule.</p>
<p>Who honestly thinks blacks or browns would join the party even if they were allowed?  What do I care if a bunch of race-traitor blacks and browns want to join whites in stopping immigration from black and brown countries?  More power to them if you ask me.  Just because they can join the party, doesn&rsquo;t mean the BNP has to change any of its policy positions.  So if non-whites want to ensure the &#8216;British people first&rsquo; and &#8216;Britain for Britons&rsquo; policies of the BNP, why should we stop them?  They&rsquo;re only trying to help.</p>
<p>The whole thing is stupid and the solution is to expose the stupidity by granting membership to anyone who wants to join, and then showing that all of ten people did so, and then asking the press if they were happy and content that the BNP was finally not racist.  After all, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a black or a brown who saves my country from a tidal wave of black/brown immigration.  All I care about is that the immigration is stopped.  If someone&rsquo;s public policies are pro-white, he&rsquo;s far better than an actual white person whose policies are anti-white.  The more the merrier.</p>

		<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t throw the fascism word around so recklessly and viciously. Go to a university library and read academic books on the topic and you&rsquo;ll find that fascism is very complicated. There is much debate about it, many different opinions, and many unanswered questions. I put some effort into understanding it and came to the conclusion that all political and social systems are fascist to some degree. Multiculturalism is fascist. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the BNP is going to deal with the racism accusation in law. If I understand the strategy, all other groups in Britain (Asian, Muslim, Jewish, black) have ethnic organizations to look after their interests. The indigenous British are not allowed to have such organizations. The BNP is thus needed to force politics to consider the ethnic needs of the indigenous British. An honest debate on ethnic interests would be most revealing and I doubt the authorities will like one to happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who honestly thinks blacks or browns would join the party even if they were allowed?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important from the point of upholding the right to free association. Whites should have the right to refuse to associate with nonwhites if that&rsquo;s what they choose. Still another reason for defending the existing membership policy is that if nonwhites were allowed in, you would begin to see all kinds of saboteurs joining up simply to be able to take over the party machinery and then destroy the party or use the apparatus for their own ends. Then where would we be?</p>
<p>The BNP is already willing to work with other ethnic groups share certain goals or perspectives, e.g. BNP leadership have made common cause with Sikhs over the Islamic problem. There&rsquo;s no need to allow everybody in.</p>

		<p>To be a member yiou must sign up to the organisations aims and constitution.</p>
<p>If black people join they must abide. If not they can be expelled.</p>
<p>There are many black and asian associations in the UK - they would fall foul of this as well. There are also many religious associations like the Muslim Parliament of Great Britian (yes, ridiculous, I know!) who are for muslims only. Is that racil/religious hatred? Womens clubs and gyms. Is that sexism?</p>
<p>The BNP will be OK. Freedom of association is a basic human right If they open up this can of worms we can close down all ethno specific organisations.  </p>

		<p>All this hot air will come to nothing - it&rsquo;s just whingeing and whining after the event.<br>
 Firstly, the BNP is entitled to European money *as of right* as all political parties in represented in Strasbourg are, and to try to construe this unconditional right as meaning the the BNP is &#8216;publically funded&rsquo; is nonsense.<br>
 Secondly, the BNP is a private members organisation - just like the Black Lawyers organisation - of which Peter Herbert is the chairman and therefore unlike an employer, for example, is free to determine its own rules of membership on whatever grounds it sees fit, just like the Boy scouts, for example exclude girls from joining.</p>

		<p>More law suits means more free press and more opportunity to exposed anti white racism like affirmative action. </p>
<p>In their quest to &#8220;expose BNP racism&#8221; they&rsquo;ll also be exposing their own anti white racism.  &#8220;6  &mdash;  Anonymous wrote at 8:47 PM on June 10:&#8221; points out a nice example. </p>
<p>From article: &#8220;What the mainstream parties have to do is prove their worth &mdash; get on the doorstep, explain to people how we are going to take up their concerns, how we are going to respond to their issues,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is the way to beat these dreadful people.&rdquo;<br>
What they fail to realize is that their words have lost credibility. They will be judged on  action. Not to mention that as the BNP message gets out the public&rsquo;s expectations will become harder for the mainstream parties to meet.   <br>

		<p>The Labour party (and the rest) have always claimed that the British National Party comprises racist, jack-booted and skin-headed nazis. Well, since the labour party has been told, in no uncertain terms, that one their candidates for a &#8216;safe seat&rsquo; is &#8216;too white and jewish&rsquo; to represent the British people, the truth is out there for all to see. The blacks and muslims in the labour promulgated &#8216;multi-cultural diversity&rsquo; society have bitten the hand that fed them. Racist (too White and Jewish), jack-booted (men in dresses, women in black hoods), skinhead (long beards). As for &#8216;extremism&rsquo;, how about &#8216;Down with Freedom&rsquo;, &#8216;Kill those who insult us&rsquo; and marching to insult our returning soldiers. &#8220;How dare you enter our muslim area&#8221;, that&rsquo;s the north of England, by the way. Well, what will labour do now? Because the whole of Britain is watching. The only &#8216;multi&rsquo; you will get is multiple wives. The only &#8216;culture&rsquo; you will get is islam. The only &#8216;diversity&rsquo; you will get is being divested of your democratic rights to nominate your own candidate and cast your own vote. What on earth do you think the BNP have been warning about for years, only to be castigated, quite wrongly, as evil racists. Now Brown claims that since the BNP won two MEP seats, there must be something wrong with the electoral process and nearly one million voters must be re-educated and the entire voting system changed. I hadn&rsquo;t realised that the BNP were that powerful!!</p>

		<p>The BNP is an anti-genocidal organization, simple as that.  On the other hand the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; are simply anti-white since all their actions are of displacing the &#8220;indigenous caucasions&#8221; and by the clauses of the UN 1948 convention against genocide the BNP is in the right on these issues.</p>

		<p>The BNP is at the stage where it needs to broaden its appeal along the lines of the other nationalist parties of Europe.  Thus, it really ought to jettison any prohibition against non-whites having membership.  I can actually imagine a few non-whites tired themselves of multicultural madness joining.  But it would doubtlessly only be a small amount.  </p>

It&rsquo;s not &#8220;race hate&#8221; nor is it &#8220;holacaust denial.&#8221; It is devastating truth. &#8220;Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to &#8220;assimilate,&#8221; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;How long would it take anyone to realize I&rsquo;m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn&rsquo;t object to this?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.&#8221; <br>

		<p>&#8220;The day is comming very soon for the Native English where the choice will be manifestly:fight back or die. The question the Native English will be forced to ask themselves is this:did I bring children into this world to be enslaved and brutalized.&#8221;    &mdash;    Jupiter</p>

You forgot to consider another group:  the great many by now who have married (or at least had children by) blacks (and others), who have in effect joined another race, as it were. They have made an accommodation with the invaders.  They have bought peace by selling themselves, their ancestry, their country, and their genes.  Their mixed-breed progeny will survive and go on, but they will no longer be white or truly English. In fact, they won&rsquo;t be precisely anything   &mdash;   which is exactly what the ruling cosmopolitans want.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how the BNP is going to deal with the racism accusation in law. If I understand the strategy, all other groups in Britain (Asian, Muslim, Jewish, black) have ethnic organizations to look after their interests. The indigenous British are not allowed to have such organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Isn&rsquo;t it a remarkable coincidence  (if indeed it is a coincidence)  that we have exactly the same thing in America? </p>

The Labour party (and the rest) have always claimed that the British National Party comprises racist, jack-booted and skin-headed nazis. </p>

<p>If Labour  were serious about politics and REAL issues, they would be less concerned about their opponents&rsquo; boots or their skin and heads! Who cares what kind of boots they wear? (Yes, I know that&rsquo;s just a sly, sneaky  attempt to dredge up old memories of other things. To cast aspersions without quite saying them.)</p>
<p>Instead of indulging dishonest name-calling and these obvious distractions, they should address the genuine matters of concern to their constituents. But they don&rsquo;t.  If Labour and the other parties had been doing their job all along (of protecting British people&rsquo;s interests) there would be no such issues attracting voters to the BNP. And no need for the BNP itself. </p>
<p>The BNP is only a reaction to the shameful failure of the establishment parties. And those problems are not going to be fixed now by the same parties that caused them and looked on benignly while they grew.<br>

		<p>Part of the reason that the BNP only accepts white members, according to Nick Griffin, is because if you refuse to hire/fire someone belonging to an ethnically exclusive organization, you can be sued under the Race Relations Act.</p>

		<p>      All power ultimately rests in force or the threat of it.<br>
It certainly helps if the people consent to their goverment but<br>
the principle remains. If the people don&rsquo;t consent, they have<br>
to summon eneough force to overthrow the reigning power. That is<br>
the position today in Britain. The Communists will have to be<br>
defeated on the streets before they can voted out of office. As<br>
far as the Courts go, they will change their tune once new judges<br>
are put on the bench. If they actually outlaw the Party before<br>
it can take power, then nothing remains for Whites but to rebel.<br>
Yes, that means guerilla warfare unless the Army can be turned.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow your meaning, I&rsquo;m afraid!  Your interpretation of what he allegedly said seems rather back the front.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know refusing to fire somebody could possibly land one in trouble with the RRA either.</p>
<p>The British National Party was founded to preserve the lineage and bloodlines of indigenous Britons which includes the Irish, Scots and Welsh besides the English since the indigenous white nationalities of The UK, are the only group without any organisation specifically founded to represent <i>their</i> human rights and ethnic interests.<br>
