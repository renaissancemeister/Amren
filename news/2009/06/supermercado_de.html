<h1><a href="http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/walmart_supermercado_061009">Supermercado de Walmart Opens</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Walmart is trying to dive deeper into the $90 billion-a-year Hispanic grocery market by opening a new supermarket in west Phoenix today.</p>
<p>The Supermercado de Walmart is one of two stores nationwide that will test the country&rsquo;s appetite for a possible string of Hispanic supermarkets. The giant retailer says its other store that opened in Houston April 29 is far exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Phoenix and Houston were chosen for their large, multigenerational Hispanic populations with considerable spending power. Arizona has about 2 million Hispanic consumers.</p>
<p>Walmart has gained considerable knowledge and experience marketing to consumers in Mexico and Latin America and hopes to leverage it to boost sales to U.S. Hispanics, who have an estimated buying power of about $1 trillion a year.</p>
<p>A study of Hispanic buying power by Oklahoma State University found that Hispanics spend a larger portion of their household incomes on food  &mdash;  $128.50 per week compared with $91 for non-Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Its not new, New Jersey has a few of those Hispanic WalMarts.  There Wal Marts have no one who speaks English and the store announcements are all in Spanish.  If WalMart is going to do this then they should be forced to place the Flag of Mexico on the front door so English speakers like me can go somewhere else to shop.  </p>

		<p>In Austin, Texas the Hispanic presence is so overwhelming at the Wal-Mart stores that Anglos call them &#8220;Wal-Martinez&#8221;. Seems like a pretty lousy swap to me&hellip;..give up the white trade in favor of Hispanic&hellip;.cannot be a good business decision.<br>

<p>No, they spend a larger portion of OUR incomes on food for their large broods due to their failure to practice birth control. It&rsquo;s very common here in texas to see a pregnant hispanic woman, early twenties, with three or four kids in tow pulling out her WIC &amp; &#8220;Lone Star card&#8221;(food stamps) to pay for her groceries. Hispanics, I&rsquo;ve noticed use food stamps far more than any other race.</p>

<p>Perhaps the signs should be in 22 languages as is the Ky. drivers test per an AR article recently:)</p>

		<p>The race-replacement of Native Born White Ameicans is occuringly more rapidly than anybody realizes. The day is surely comming that the millions of Whites -who spent years in denial about the obvious-will wake up one day not knowing what  hit them and their families. It will be a knock out punch.</p>
<p>Things will only change when their is a catastrophe. Our job as White Nationalist is to provide them with a framework to understand the sitution. Only when millions of Native Born White Americans start thinking differently about things can the situation be reversed. What I will tell my fellow Native Born White Americans:Is the pain level great enough or would you like some more of the blessings of diversity?</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans did not have the option of leaving the old suburbs for the past 30 years&hellip;. LEGAL IMMIGRATION and illegal immigration woould have been shut down twenty years&hellip;to 0. There would have been no silly talk about the blessngs of diversity..it would have been to costly to do so.  The gloves would have come off. there would have bee no mercy.</p>

A study of Hispanic buying power by Oklahoma State University found that Hispanics spend a larger portion of their household incomes on food &mdash; $128.50 per week compared with $91 for non-Hispanics.</p>
<p>A) Study of Hispanic buying power=good use of taxpayer money<br>
B) Their household incomes=welfare <br>
C) When you have 12 people living in your &#8220;household&#8221;, your food bill probably will be higher<br>

<p>Of course. Because most of them use illegally gotten food stamps and send their cash back to mexico.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I&rsquo;ve stood in a checkout line behind a slew of mexicans with overflowing grocery carts, with my 3 or 4 items in a handbasket, and watched every single one of them pay with a food stamp card while the men are at the service window wiring money back to mexico. And more often than not, they&rsquo;ll call the men over to pay for some beer and cigarettes and the guys will pull a big wad of cash out of their pockets.</p>
<p>Ironically, these food stamp cards have the American flag emblazened upon them. The same one they burn, spit on, and drag on the ground during their immigration rights demonstrations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose they can afford to eat better than us&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous, yes.  But in response to that, I say: <b> &#8220;Nobody can take advantage of you without your permission.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>I recently saw that statement attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt. I had thought it was Ann lLanders.  Well, no matter who said it first, it still makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>We Americans have this present mess because we Americans have allowed it. Most of us have tolerated it.  Many of us have actively encouraged it.  We have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>

<p>That statement is 100 percent accurate. The greedy cheating class rules by consent. Even monarchies ruled by consent of the people. One that consent was lost, the monarchies in Europe fell or were marginalized into quaint tourist attractions. Once a critical number of Native Born White Americans withdraw their consent to be goverened by the Republican-Democratic bipartisan consensus&hellip;the game is over and much will be possible.</p>
<p>The Soviet Stalanist system fell because the Russian peole no longer gave their consent to it.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans can have their country back if they want it. The &#8220;Amerian&#8221; left and Liberals are very aware of this. It is their greatest fear.</p>
<p>In fact, all that would have to happen is for Native Born White Americans who vote Republican to abandon the Republican party for racial reasons. Once this happens, the situation will turn itself around real fast. Peter Brimelow:let the Republican party croak!!!!!</p>
