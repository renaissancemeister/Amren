			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Smith, WBAL-AM (Baltimore), June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Here is the column that was submitted by Ron Smith, a weekly Baltimore Sun columnist, to the newspaper. However, The Sun decided not to run the piece today for various reasons. Decide for yourself whether the decision makers at The Sun made the right decision.</p>
<p>Because of all the reports I&rsquo;ve read and conversations I&rsquo;ve had on the radio this week about Baltimore&rsquo;s notorious violence being directed these days randomly at people going about their daily business even in the supposedly safe &#8220;touristy&#8221; areas of the city, I reached for my copy of Anthropologist Jack Weatherford&rsquo;s book, &#8220;Savages and Civilization: Who Will Survive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Weatherford {snip} argues that cities, the centers of civilization, are inherently destructive. &#8220;They consume the areas around themselves,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;and if they cannot find new materials, they die.&#8221; Think of it this way: the discipline of archeology arose from what? From the study of dead cities, strewn about the landscape of the world. What kills them? He says the cause is the extravagant habits of consumption and destruction that are at the heart of civilization. Everything is eventually consumed. The forests are denuded. Water, plants, stone, metal, animals, even the land itself is used up. {snip}</p>
<p>That game is now over. What can be civilized has been. How, you might wonder, does this tie into the increasing violence in our big cities? I&rsquo;ll tell you. Jack Weatherford is an expert on tribal cultures. He has written books about the epic clash between the Native American and European cultures during the 300 years of warfare between the two. Civilized people have defeated the tribal peoples of the world, who have been killed or scattered. But the tribal people who survived have been moving en masse into the worlds&rsquo; major urban areas. {snip} Group conflict, far from being eradicated, has been heightened in modern times. The nation-state swallowed the remaining tribal people but could not digest them.</p>
<p>And that brings us to this startling observation from Mr. Weatherford after spending some time doing field research in Washington, D.C.: &#8220;Nowhere in the world had I witnessed as much savagery, brutality, crime and cruelty as I did on the streets of the capital city of the United States.&#8221; He worked at a bookstore. The clerk who worked at it before him was shot in the head and killed. The clerk who replaced him was beaten with a metal pipe and left for dead. &#8220;On the streets of Washington,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I saw forms of social organization and culture that I had never seen among any tribal people. Everywhere in the world, tribal life centers on the family and family units, but in the center cities of America, the family has broken down.&#8221; The welfare state put the finishing touches on the destruction of the family.</p>
<p>In the fifteen years since his book was published, we can safely assume things have degenerated even more. Young males in the inner cities pursue their lives and interests separate from the females with whom they beget children. &#8220;Much of the male activity,&#8221; Weatherford observes, &#8220;varies between idle boredom and fierce violence.&#8221; The males coalesce into gangs that operate with warrior bravado. This is the reality. {snip} Wherever uncontrolled crime appears, vigilantism soon follows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Strange things are happening. Unease is widespread. With good reason.<br>

		<p>Rush had a story today about how an investment house is moving out of Baltimore City, mainly because &#8220;roving gangs of teens&#8221; are stealing employees&rsquo; cars and robbing employees at gun point.  Not that Rush would be able to put two and two together, doing so would be the end of his $30 million a year cornucopia.  But he isn&rsquo;t needed to do that.  </p>

 The government has made it clear that the minorities are the protected groups. When it gets to critical mass, the group under attack will usually come together for their own protection. I personally do not consider this vigilantism but pure survival.</p>

		<p>It is this clash of cultures that naturally spells doom for the rainbow coalition&rsquo;s desire for a multicultural utopia.</p>
<p>They would have us believe that the only difference between blacks, whites and others is skin color, yet they can&rsquo;t explain why blacks naturally behave in such primitive ways, are unintelligent, and are prone to violence, more so than any other people on earth.</p>
<p>Many Indians are as dark as blacks, but, for the most part, their difference in behavior, ability to learn, build and organize, are more like whites than blacks.  In fact almost every person of color on earth is on a higher level than blacks, so the &#8220;We&rsquo;re-all-the-same-but-skin-color&#8221; crowd&rsquo;s point of view can only be believed by a mentally challenged few.</p>
<p>It will be science that will settle this matter once and for all, if we survive this downward spiral into destruction that we&rsquo;re on right now.</p>

<p>Just a few legal and propagandistic measures will hasten the destruction of any city. First, suppress all mention of the truth regarding feral predators. Second, ferociously prosecute all would-be vigilantes: pillory anyone who suggests that there might be a problem, and crucify anyone who takes arms. Finally, tax the prey to feed the predators. </p>

		<p>We can learn much from the study of dead, abandoned cities and societies.  The Aztecs and Incas, the Egyptians, the Babylonians&hellip;   </p>
<p>Wherever a society has collapsed, it is because it grew and consumed indiscriminately, mocking nature&rsquo;s laws.  Savagery was not resisted, rather, it was properly invited.</p>

		<p>Whew! Things are bad here in Miami, but I do not get this same sense of danger. Of course, here in this area we are allowed to keep firearms without much hassle, ahd this tends to damp crime down some. That said, the intra- group violence is staggering. When I pick up the newspaper and read about still another murder, it is usually located in one of several predominately African American areas. <br>
I happened to do a bit of research on &#8220;hunter-gatherer&#8221; societies. and I believe that it is worth looking at the African American community in that light. This type of society has a short time horizon and wants a quick payoff (not like, say, farming communities). Hunting/gathering can arguably be seen in crimes like, robbery (hunting), and theft (gathering), where the object to be hunted or gathered can be dealt with quickly with a fast payoff. </p>

		<p>Mr. Weatherford&rsquo;s diagnosis fits ancient cities well, but modern cities are productive centers. The true source of conflict is the presence of &#8220;tribal&#8221; peoples in modern cosmopolitan settings, where they indeed cannot be digested. That much he nailed.</p>

In a bucolic setting, the herd is it&rsquo;s own protection. The cities that Europeans and Asians created served to protect the people. Of course, there were always predators in these cities but they were removed to jails and prisons for the protection of the largely peaceful majority.</p>
<p>We have let large numbers of feral predators into our midst in the vain hope that living among us, they would become civilized. Crime facts have proven this pie-in-the-sky, harebrained theory wrong.</p>

		<p>Welfare is slavery.  When working people must pay welfare for non-working people and their worthless children, then we are indeed enslaved.  However, Washington and the white elites are too girly and too corrupt to end slavery and thus we must do it.  How?  By any means necessary.  If we can stop black womean from having children out of wedlock, find a way to stop paying for their children, force them to have more abortions, offer them free passage back to africa, and making sure the black african men to impregnated them pay for their mistake (enslave them like they enslave us).  Until we speak truth to power and become activist,  Africans and their Bolshevik white sidekicks are and will continue to enslave us. Also, get out of the Christian churches that promote our enslavement and the oppression of our children through affirmative oppression programs.  </p>

		<p>I thought the article was very well written and had a great anthropological explanation. Concise and to the point. It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs, indeed, when the truth is stifled, in regard to the article not being run by the Sun. &#8220;The nation-state swallowed the remaining tribal people but could not digest them.&#8221; Great analogy, if we could but shat them out, as it were. Indeed, assimilation by the &#8220;tribal peoples&#8221; has obviously failed miserably, but the &#8220;melting-pot/diversity magpies&#8221; are going to (attempt to) ram their illogical/false-utopian vision(!?)of society down our throats even as it ultimately destroys that very society. Assimilate or segregate, it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

That applies under normal conditions when people are not interfered with in following their survival instincts.<br>
But not where unnatural conditions are imposed and people are prevented (whether by law or propaganda) from coming together for their own survival.</p>

		<p>I observed the tribal, feral nature of the African youth first hand in 1971 when a northern court ordered busing in my home town in Florida.</p>
<p>Prior to the forced invasion, my high school was deemed on of the best in Florida, highest SAT scores, excellent science facilities with a campus that was peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p>The two all-African high schools in the projets were closed down and the inhabitants were bussed to the south side of town. Two days after arriving, the tribes got angry about something and burned down the cafeteria resulting in a one month closure of the campus.</p>
<p>It was all down hill from there. Constant fights in the hallways, robberies at knife point in the bathrooms and cafeteria, police living on the campus. In short order, the tribes turned one of Florida&rsquo;s best high-schools into just another ghetto warehouse for the tribal members.</p>

		<p>The firm is New Enterprise Associates, leaving downtown Baltimore for the much-safer suburb of Timonium.  In a <a href="https://www.pehub.com/41606/bad-news-for-downtown-baltimore-nea-moves-out-citing-needles-used-condoms-and-psychotic-homeless-people/" rel="nofollow"> press release </a> they wrote the mayor:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Our decision was a result of the high level of crime in our neighborhood.  Over the last several years, many of our cars have been broken into resulting in very expensive repairs, our employees have been robbed at gun point, drug needles and used condoms have been left on our front stoop, and psychotic homeless people have menaced our employees and threatened to kill them.  We have voiced our frustrations to the local community leaders and police, but the environment has only worsened.  The recent local beatings by roving teenagers during the day in this neighborhood, the raucous club in the basement of the Belvedere, and other gang violence throughout the city reinforces the appropriateness of New Enterprise Associates&rsquo; decision to move in order to protect its employees.

<p>
Of course, this erodes the tax base further.</p>

		<p>Without Johns Hopkins Hospital and a handful of neighborhoods(Fells Point, Federal Hill, Canton, Camden), Baltimore would be heading toward the collapse of civilization that Detroit experiences.  Pig Town and Highlandtown will be all-black in a generation.  Most of the whites under sixty in either neighborhood are functionally black.  The white women and girls of each  quite regularly shack up with black men and provide Charm City hundreds of mulatto babies every year.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Weatherford&rsquo;s diagnosis fits ancient cities well, but modern cities are productive centers.&#8221; <br>
PhilipL you hit the nail on the head here. Ancient cities, even ancient Rome, served as administrative centers for the extraction of wealth from the provinces. After the industrial revolution cities became so productive they no longer needed to extract wealth from the provinces or colonies, contrary to what Marxists claim (they are wrong 99% of the time). <br>
The irony now is that the extractive coercive nature of the city is returning with a vengeance. Instead of pillaging the provinces and colonies to enrich the elite of the city, the state pillages the productive people to buy political support from the underclass. Its only a matter of time before the useless eaters overwhelm the producers and the producers will<br>
a. Die off (Zimbabwe)<br>
b. Flee (Every American city)<br>
c. Revolt (God willing!)<br>
The city itself is not &#8220;Evil&#8221; but the basis of civilization and culture. Go to Tokyo or even a poorer city in China or Korea and you will not find the social ailments of the American City. Go to European cities (the ones that remain European) and you will not find gangs roaming the streets. <br>

		<p>They are itching for an opportunity to burn white neighborhoods. Such speculation has found it&rsquo;s place on blog sites such as Nat Turner&rsquo;s Revenge. Another one seeing Nat as a hero from 1831, though most of Nat and his associate&rsquo;s victims were children followed by women and men. They actually went back to their first victims house to kill a sleeping infant. At least 10 school children slaughtered at Levi Waller&rsquo;s school. When people can hold such villains in the high ranks as heroes, then you know you have a problem.</p>

		<p>GREAT ARTICLE!</p>
<p>From that article: &ldquo;He argues that cities, the centers of civilization, are inherently destructive. &lsquo;They consume the areas around themselves,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;and if they cannot find new materials, they die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is very true. Cities are definitely huge parasites, consuming MANY more resources (food/water, energy, metal, etc) than they produce. I&rsquo;ve been anti-urbanist myself for quite a while, and I&rsquo;m now a localist/regionalist, an agrarian, and an &lsquo;ecosocialist.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The commenter PhilipL is totally wrong when he wrote: &#8220;Mr. Weatherford&rsquo;s diagnosis fits ancient cities well, but modern cities are productive centers.&#8221;  Actually, it&rsquo;s the reverse&hellip;ancient cities were indeed centers of ideas, progress, and production, but modern cities have become unproductive in that they are mostly populated by a bunch of paper-shuffling bureaucrats, thieving bankers, useless lawyers and salespeople, gangbangers, drug-users, and other assorted useless eaters who just consume-consume-consume yet rarely produce anything of note or use considering the size of many major urban areas.  </p>
<p>Just stop for a minute and think about the HUGE quantity of resources it takes daily just to keep a modern city in basic working order&hellip;MASSIVE amounts of water, food, and energy are brought in daily, yet mostly what is &#8216;pumped out&rsquo; of them daily is just raw sewage and a bunch of idiotic and destructive leftist politics&hellip;also think about how little modern urbanites actually contributed in a single day compared to how many resources were brought in to them&hellip;not much probably!  It&rsquo;s of course much more likely that modern cities CONSUME a whole lot more than they produce.  American cities did used to be great centers of industrial productivity until recently.  Nowadays though most American manufacturing is decentralized - decentralization of manufacturing is good due to the fact that spreading manufacturing around lessens the overall negative environmental impact on an area like a city where it used to be concentrated and thus very deleterious to the environment there.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d all be MUCH happier if we could go back to more environmentally-friendly living patterns in localized &lsquo;ecovillages&rsquo; or &#8216;ecotowns&rsquo; - however, because I am an ethno-nationalist I think that these ecovillages/ecotowns would only succeed if they were ethnically/racially homogeneous (the same way socialism can only succeed amongst ethnically/racially homogeneous populations, groups, or nations).  Cities could even be turned in to &#8216;ecocities,&rsquo; but they would have to be broken up in to MANY different parts (making them in effect a lumped together group of towns/villages), with each particular part providing most of its own resources on the surrounding land and in conjunction with the surrounding ecotowns and ecovillages.</p>
<p>I think that many of the problems with modern cities stem from the fact that they are so often extremely multiracial and thus filled with so many groups and individuals competing for resources that the overall level of trust between fellow urbanites is very low. </p>
<p>A book which is similar to the one mentioned in that article, Desmond Morris&rsquo; THE HUMAN ZOO: A ZOOLOGIST&rsquo;S STUDY OF THE URBAN ANIMAL, notes similar problems with cities and city-dwellers (urbanites). He notes that the majority of urbanites exhibit many pathological/unnatural behaviors which are also commonly seen amongst captive (read:UNFREE) animals kept in zoos. In that book Morris writes: &ldquo;&hellip;under normal conditions, in their natural habitats, wild animals do not mutilate themselves, masturbate, attack their offspring, develop stomach ulcers, become fetishists, suffer from obesity, form homosexual pair-bonds, or commit murder. Among human city dwellers, needless to say, all of these things occur. &hellip; Other animals do behave in these ways under certain circumstances, namely when they are confined in the unnatural conditions of captivity. The zoo animal in a cage exhibits all these abnormalities that we know so well from our human companions. Clearly, then, the city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chronic pathologies so often found amongst lifelong urbanites is another reason to not follow their lead or emulate their behavior/living patterns; groups which have been urbanized for many generations start to exhibit some of the most extreme forms of urban-induced mental derangement and physical degeneration from too much confinement in the city, disconnection from nature, etc.  Similar to so-called &#8216;cabin fever&rsquo; suffered by people who are forced to live indoors for months during the very cold winter months, lifelong urbanites suffer from something called &#8216;urban fever&rsquo; and definitely exhibit many deeply negative behavior patterns as a result of their urban confinement.</p>
