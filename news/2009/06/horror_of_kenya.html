<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8119201.stm">Horror of Kenya&rsquo;s &#8216;Witch&rsquo; Lynchings</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Odhiambo Joseph, BBC News, June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Villagers, many straight from their farms, and armed with machetes, sticks and axes, are shouting and crowding round in a big group in Kenya&rsquo;s fertile Kisii district.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see clearly what is going on, but heavy smoke is rising from the ground and a horrible stench fills the air.</p>
<p>More people are streaming up the hill, some of them with firewood and maize stalks.</p>
<p>Suddenly an old woman breaks from the crowd, screaming for mercy. Three or four people go after her, beat her and drag her back, pushing her onto  &mdash;  what I can now see  &mdash;  is a raging fire.</p>
<p><b>Burned alive</b></p>
<p>I was witnessing a horrific practice which appears to be on the increase in Kenya  &mdash;  the lynching of people accused of being witches.</p>
<p>I personally saw the burning alive of five elderly men and women in Itii village.</p>
<p>I had been visiting relatives in a nearby town, when I heard what was happening. I dashed to the scene, accompanied by a village elder.</p>
<p>He reacted as if what we were watching was quite normal, which was shocking for me.</p>
<p>As a stranger I felt I had no choice but to stand by and watch. My fear was that if I showed any sign of disapproval, or made any false move, the angry mob could turn on me.</p>
<p>Not one person was protesting or trying to stop the killing.</p>
<p>Hours later, the police came and removed the charred bodies.</p>
<p>Village youths who took part in the killings told me that the five victims had to die because they had bewitched a young boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course some people have been burned. But there is proof of witchcraft,&#8221; said one youth.</p>
<p>He said that a child had spent the night walking around and then was unable to talk the following morning  &mdash;  except to one of the so-called witches.</p>
<p>I asked the youths whether or not people involved in this supposed witchcraft should be punished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they must be punished, every one,&#8221; said the first youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very angry and that&rsquo;s why we end up punishing these people and even killing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friend agreed: &#8220;In other communities, there are witches all round but in Kisii we have come up with a new method, we want to kill these people using our own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>I later discovered that the young boy who had supposedly been bewitched, was suffering from epilepsy.</p>
<p>His mother had panicked when he had had an attack.</p>
<p><b>All too common</b></p>
<p>The village elder was dismissive of my horror, saying that this kind of thing happens all the time in the western district of Kisii.</p>
<p>He told me about Joseph Ondieki, whose mother had been burned to death less than two months earlier.</p>
<p>I found Joseph and his wife Mary Nyaboke tending vegetables in their small shamba, or homestead.</p>
<p>If I visit my neighbours I fear they might poison my food</p>
<p>Mary told me that on the day her mother-in-law had been killed she had been visiting her own parents.</p>
<p>She had heard a noise and discovered the truth when she came home.</p>
<p>She said that in the 20 years she had been married, she had never had any reason to believe her husband&rsquo;s mother was a witch.</p>
<p>Joseph told me he has suffered a lot since his mother died.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born here, but at this stage I feel as if this is not my home any more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot visit neighbours or relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even when they see me standing by the road side, they point at me, saying: &#8216;That is a son of the witch&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The couple fear they may be the next victims</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I go to town they also start wondering what has taken me there. Is it that I am going to give evidence against them?</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come back, they say I&rsquo;ve been seen at the police station, but I&rsquo;ve never been there. I&rsquo;ve never reported the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I visit the neighbours, I always fear that they might put poison in the food.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when I&rsquo;m forced to visit, I make sure I don&rsquo;t eat anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&rsquo;t get my own food I just have a glass of water and sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>I set off with Joseph up the hill towards his house, which was far from the centre of the village.</p>
<p>On the way we passed his mother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>A neighbour was reluctant to talk to me and denied even knowing Joseph&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in Kisii, people are being burned on mere allegation and most of them are old,&#8221; Joseph said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now don&rsquo;t have any old people in the village to consult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even me I&rsquo;m now approaching 50 years old  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m afraid that they&rsquo;ll come for me also.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Warning signs</b></p>
<p>I spent three days in Kisii trying to speak to the authorities, but nobody, neither the police nor the local government officials would talk to me.</p>
<p>map</p>
<p>As night drew in, and it was time for me to leave, Joseph walked with me from his village to where my car was parked.</p>
<p>When we arrived, he begged me to take him with me to Mombasa, where I am based.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for me to leave him behind.</p>
<p>As I drove away I passed signs pinned to trees, warning witches that they would be tracked down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know you by your names&#8221;, someone had typed in bold.<br/>

		<p>Quick!  We need to import thousands of these people who will bring vibrant new ideas to America   &mdash;   We all benefit when we are exposed to such diversity, especially if it is the ancient wisdom of the forest people, living in harmony with their natural surroundings.  I know this, because I&rsquo;ve watched many TV shows and Holllywood movies.  </p>

		<p>There is a video on www.zasucks.com in the archives back in May 17th I think of just one of these &#8220;witch burnings&#8221; shocking to many, real to all, and Africa as usual. It is titled  Witch burning!!! imagine that!</p>

		<p>Sure, we&rsquo;re shocked now, but just give it a few years and I&rsquo;m sure Los Angeles and NYC will have designated witch burning ceremony grounds (next to the female circumcision grounds) What right do we have to judge the cultures of others?</p>

		<p>This is where our president was born. Yeah, take a minute to let that one sink in.</p>
<p>I have two thoughts on this. First, the son of the woman who was burned would have probably been leading the mob if it had been someone else&rsquo;s mother. Second, witches in Africa aren&rsquo;t like the kind we think of. They are into voodoo. And they actually pay thugs to go out and kill people so that they can use their body parts for &#8220;magic&#8221;. And they also advise customers to rape babies as a cure for AIDs. Although most of the people being burned probably have nothing to do with that.</p>

		<p>This is EXACTLY the reason we need to throw more money at Africa. Those poor suffering folks just need a wee bit more uplifting, another 100 billion or so, and all will be peaceful, democratic even.  They are on the very cusp of western values.  A few trillion more should put them over the top for good.  Give today.  Give generously.  We are so close to achieving moral parity for Africa</p>

		<p>The anointed one in the White House has this same type of &#8220;Kenya&#8221; thinking and the witch hunt has already started here in America. It&rsquo;s quite obvious when you read the Janet Napolitano DHS reports.<br/>
If you dare disagree with the lord and master in any way shape or form you shall be &#8220;burned&#8221; in one way or another.</p>

		<p>Very tragic. But I&rsquo;d really like to know how this started. I&rsquo;m sure these people can be educated, just like our ancestors, who went on their own witch hunts (Salem comes to mind, although it was MUCH less brutal).</p>

		<p>Nothing to see here folks. Just African Bantus being African Bantus. Why all the commotion?</p>
<p>On a sidebar, what i said was going to happen, has indeed happened. Sharpton and Jessie Jackson have stuck their beaks into Michael Jackson&rsquo;s carcass. We at Amren should say prayers of thanksgiving that Jackson&rsquo;s doctor was south of Algeria - could you imagine if it was a white doctor - the murder conspiracies would be flying like a flock of swifts.<br/>

		<p>During his recent visit to Africa, Pope Benedict XVI spoke in Angola about many Africans &#8220;living in fear of spirits, of malign and threatening powers. In their bewilderment they end up even condemning street children and the elderly as alleged sorcerers. Who can go to them to proclaim that Christ has triumphed over death and all those occult powers?&#8221;  The pope was expressing his concern about the persistence of the belief in witchcraft among Africans. This belief is certainly widespread throughout the continent. In Kenya, hardly a day passes without news reports of this phenomenon, especially the harassment of suspected witches.<br/>
 <br/>
Since mid-2007, children have been kidnapped and murdered in Uganda in what are believed to be bizarre rituals to attain wealth. In Tanzania, the killing of albinos whose body parts are reportedly used to make charms has caused global consternation.  And last month, Amnesty International found out that up to 1,000 suspected witches in The Gambia had been kidnapped from their villages by witchdoctors employed by the government in a nationwide witch-hunting campaign.  Perhaps more astonishing for Christians was the revelation in 2006 by the bishops of southern Africa that &#8220;some Catholic priests act as Sangomas and call on the ancestors for healing.&#8221; A Sangoma is a traditional diviner-healer whose many functions include counteracting witches.  <br/>
 <br/>
But even when witchcraft is not making the headlines, it is still a daily issue in Africa. The southern African bishops noted that &#8220;many African Christians, during difficult moments in their lives, resort to practices of the traditional religion: the intervention of ancestral spirits, the engagement of spirit-mediums, spirit-possession, consulting diviners about lost items and about the future, magical practices and identifying (&#8216;smelling out&rsquo;) one&rsquo;s enemies, etc.&#8221;  Last year, Cardinal Polycarp Pengo of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM) decried &#8220;the phenomenon common in many African societies of Christianity on Sunday morning and the practice of witchcraft and sorcery during the rest of the week.&#8221;<br/>
 </p>
<p>Why does belief in witchcraft persist? The attitude of mainstream Christianity is that witchcraft is a vestige of African &#8216;backwardness&rsquo;, the evidence of incomplete conversion or relapse to &#8216;paganism&rsquo;. More pastoral attention would stamp out the menace.  Witchcraft is also dismissed as ignorant superstition or fear of the unknown. The practitioners and their victims believe in powers that simply do not exist. Sometimes belief in the dark arts is attributed to mass poverty and state failure to &#8216;modernize&rsquo; the outlook especially of people living in the rural areas. It is argued that if people were better educated and had access to adequate healthcare they would understand that illness is caused by germs and not witchcraft.  But these explanations miss the biggest point. They fail to place witchcraft within the persistent African worldview. Belief in witchcraft is part and parcel of the moral universe as understood in African Traditional Religion. Contrary to popular belief, African Religion is still alive and well.<br/>
 <br/>
In African religious thought, the universe created by God ought to be harmonious, balanced and good. But mysterious evil powers exist that disrupt this order. Evil originates not merely from the breaking of taboos and other laws, but from spiritual, mystical powers at work in the universe.  The eminent Tanzanian theologian Fr. Laurent Magesa explains that witchcraft is supernatural. The witch is a person possessing or possessed of, or by, supernatural forces which he or she uses knowingly or unknowingly, selectively or indiscriminately, to harm others often for no apparent reason. Magesa writes that &#8220;evil, in the African perception, is always incarnated; it does not exist except as it exists in the evil person, that is, in the witch.&#8221;  So, how can belief in witchcraft be eradicated? This is hardly possible. According to Fr. Magesa, &#8220;in African Religion, witchcraft must be understood as part of the mystery of the human person&#8221;. Witchcraft is therefore central to the understanding of morality and ethics among Africans.  &#8220;In the African mentality, everything wrong or bad in society and in the world, and most particularly various afflictions, originates in witchcraft. There is no kind of illness or hardship at all that may not ultimately be attributed to witchcraft&#8221;.  Belief in witchcraft shall therefore persist as long as African Traditional Religion exerts influence on Africans. As it is, most African Christians subscribe to two faith traditions. Perhaps the church should not dismiss witchcraft as superstitious nonsense but instead develop appropriate pastoral responses that take into account the African worldview.<br/>
