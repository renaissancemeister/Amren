<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the mid-1980s a number of books have detailed homegrown paramilitaries and the bigoted zealots behind them, but &#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; provides an entirely deeper level of analysis. [Leonard] Zeskind is the first to fully integrate a sophisticated understanding of global events  &mdash;  specifically the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union  &mdash;  with an equally forceful insight into the uniquely American dynamics of racial identity, Southern sectionalism and national politics. After the Soviet Union &#8220;cracked apart like a three-minute egg,&#8221; and anticommunism became almost instantly irrelevant to American national identity, white nationalists rushed in to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War dichotomy gave way to a new struggle, that of nationalism vs. internationalism, and the results of this &#8220;geopolitical earthquake&#8221; are still reverberating all around us, Zeskind explains. While most of the civilized world ostensibly looked on with horror as the multicultural communities of Yugoslavia disintegrated under the demands of ethnic nationalism, white supremacists and antisemites in the United States saw increased promise in the prospect of recasting their domestic struggle as both an ethnic and religious war.</p>
<p>{snip} Zeskind concentrates not only on painting the picture of a movement  &mdash;  which allows the plethora of people and groups he describes to fall into place more readily  &mdash;  but also on highlighting the critical fault line between &#8220;vanguardists,&#8221; who advocate violent, revolutionary struggle, and &#8220;mainstreamers,&#8221; who favor the ballot box over the bullet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; elucidates this distinction chiefly through the personalities and political histories of two men who contributed perhaps more than anyone else to the development of the contemporary white nationalist movement. William Pierce, a physicist by training, was in the vanguard, while Willis Carto, a gray everyman with a background in sales, pushed toward the mainstream. Both were children of the Depression who came of age politically in the wake of the Brown v. Board of Education decision ending segregation, and both dedicated the balance of their lives to the cause of white supremacy and the extirpation of anything Jewish, but any similarity ended there.</p>
<p>Carto was the founder of the perennially vitriolic and &#8220;anti-Zionist&#8221; Liberty Lobby, which at its peak employed dozens of staffers in its Capitol Hill offices, had a multimillion dollar budget and circulated its house organ, The Spotlight, to hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers. {snip}</p>
<p>Where Carto sought to penetrate the ranks of mainstream conservatives, as well as peel off conservative constituencies to his own cause, Pierce had a more narrow view: He sought to recruit hardened cadres of violent revolutionaries, men willing to die for the cause of Aryan brotherhood and racial revolution. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; does more than simply tell the story of Carto and Pierce; it comprehensively exposes and illuminates a cast of characters who occupy places of particular importance on either side of the line dividing mainstreamers from revolutionaries, and thus contextualizes literally all the significant recent personalities and events within the white nationalist movement. While the political ascendancy of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke has inspired countless expos√©s, Zeskind&rsquo;s treatment of Duke&rsquo;s political experiment more thoroughly explains the origins of the movement that gave rise to him and the one he subsequently helped shape. While the story of The Order, a 1980s-era band of bank robbers and would-be Aryan warriors, has been detailed vividly by a range of journalists and authors, &#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; is the first book to fully articulate the tension between these vanguardists and their &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; counterparts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zeskind also takes aim squarely at former syndicated columnist Samuel Francis  &mdash;  a paleo-conservative stalwart  &mdash;  and his journalist-turned-politician colleague, Patrick Buchanan, who stunned the Republican political establishment with his first-place finish in the 1996 New Hampshire presidential primary and went on to poll more than 3 million votes by hammering away at brown-skinned immigrants, embracing the Confederate flag and excoriating abortionists. Buchanan was &#8220;a white Christian nationalist, first and foremost,&#8221; Zeskind reminds us, before detailing the healthy smattering of professional racists and antisemites who peppered the state leadership of his national campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; also reprises the success of such old-line segregationist groups as the Council of Conservative Citizens, which changed its name but not its racist agenda. Most important, the council claimed an array of local, state and federal elected officials as their allies, including former Georgia congressman Bob Barr and former Senate majority leader Trent Lott, who were forced to distance themselves when their links to the council became front-page news.</p>
<p>Although antisemitism and racism are usually inseparable handmaidens within the white nationalist movement, some groups tried to parse their prejudices. It was an awkward endeavor. Jared Taylor, founder of the group American Renaissance, reveled in the pseudo-intellectual discourse of scientific racism, but he inspired the ire of fellow activists by giving a platform to such men as Rabbi Mayer Schiller, a teacher at Yeshiva University High School in Manhattan, despite the fact that the rabbi objected to &#8220;egalitarianism&#8221; and bemoaned the destruction of the white race as vigorously as any white supremacist.</p>
<p>As prologue, Zeskind recounts the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia and notes that &#8220;in a matter of a few historical seconds,&#8221; this multiethnic state went up in flames. While Zeskind doesn&rsquo;t predict similar violence in the United States, he does forcefully make the point that the inevitable midcentury demographic shift toward a minority-white nation has the potential to stimulate white nationalists of future generations to pursue a balkanization of their own design. No doubt some hardened movement activists will be spurred to commit violence, as they always have. More important, Zeskind warns us, others will seek to use politics to consolidate white racial and political identity in reaction to the inevitable demographic change. To do so, they will draw on symbols of the past to write their future.</p>
<p>{snip}. What remains an open question, in Zeskind&rsquo;s eyes, is how well the nation will make the transition to become a multiethnic state in which white people are a minority. For those who are committed to making that changeover a successful one, it will be necessary to anticipate and understand the forces that are likely to be arrayed against them. &#8220;Blood and Politics&#8221; will be indispensable to that effort.<br>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t spend time refuting all this, but the writer&rsquo;s mention of Soviet communism is interesting.  They say hindsight is 20/20, and it is becoming perfectly obvious to me with each passing year that our obsession with Communism in general, and its variant practiced by the Russian Empire (aka Soviet Union), was unhealthy, and bit us back in the long run, and by us, I mean white nationalists.</p>
<p>The whole of the American government just had to help Afghanistan resist the Soviet invasion in 1979.  For years, the CIA pumped untold dollars and military resources to drive the Soviets out.  And that they did, but the trouble is that the excrement we stirred up in order to do so created AQ, OBL, Taliban, which in turn created 9/11.  If we knew in 1979 what we know now, we should have helped the Soviets overrun Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In South and Central America, we did the same, to help them resist the Soviet Union.  Likewise, our messing around created MS-13, the 18th Street gang, and others, which are now causing us trouble.</p>
<p>If I ever come into serious political power, my fundamental rule of foreign policy would be not to side actively with a non-white country, power, potentate or principality over a white one, no matter how abhorrent I find the ideology of the other white country.</p>

		<p>White Nationalism magically sprang up after the Soviet Union collapsed. &#8220;For those who are committed to making that changeover (to a white minority nation) a successful one, it will be necessary to anticipate and understand the forces that are likely to be arrayed against them. &ldquo;Blood and Politics&rdquo; will be indispensable to that effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can always create the forces of dissent. Controlling these &#8216;voices&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s even better than anticipating what they&rsquo;ll do.</p>

		<p>As much as we may have confidence in Ziskind&rsquo;s integrity, honesty, and lack of bias, he may not be the right person to answer his question:</p>
<p>&#8220;What remains an open question, in Ziskind&rsquo;s eyes, is how well the nation will make the transition to become a multiethnic state in which white people are a minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a curious issue for him to raise, but there seems to be an assumption that it is a matter of being a minority or a majority which is not at all true.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about equality between and among the variety of ethic groups   &mdash;   a disorganized majority can be slapped around verbally &amp; physically with impunity by members of a minority group when the minority group is organized. And the majority group members will be slapped around in school hallways &amp; buses, in college texts, and throughout the dominant media culture and the corporate entertainment culture.</p>
<p>Although I hardly think the point needs documenting, consider this: Who speaks up for the diverse white American peoples when they are smeared or slandered or slurred?  Who speaks up when we find that Hispanics, for example, are not counted as perpetrators of hate crimes in federal statistics, being divided about 90% assigned to the white category and 10% assigned to the black category? That is such an injustice on its face that the utter silence of the white US Senators &amp; Members of Congress speaks louder than necessary   &mdash;   European Americans have no elected or appointed officials who will even criticize official governmental slander that counts people as white hate crime perpetrators when those so counted do not even think of themselves as white.</p>
<p>The solution in the short term is not some fancy formulation, it is simply the creation of a defensive white political identity with allies in high places who can defend our children from slander, and who will enter the political arena in the same way that other groups&rsquo; members do it.  Let&rsquo;s face it, you can&rsquo;t beat someone in a contest when you are silenced.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget, the belief that America is still a unitary state is now the leading example of false consciousness that we are encouraged to maintain by our conservative, neoconservative, paleoconservative, and libertarian friends.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;As prologue, Zeskind recounts the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia and notes that &lsquo;in a matter of a few historical seconds,&rsquo; this multiethnic state went up in flames. While Zeskind doesn&rsquo;t predict similar violence in the United States, he does forcefully make the point that the inevitable midcentury demographic shift toward a minority-white nation has the potential to stimulate white nationalists of future generations to pursue a balkanization of their own design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rather clumsy and idiotic riddle, wrapped in an enigmatic enema bag, and set on the table as a mysterious enchilada of hopefulness. That is what multiculturalism is, and what Comrade Zeskind seems to imply as an &ldquo;insight&rdquo; into our movement. How interesting still, is that the collapse of the Yugoslavian Communist mini-state is bemoaned here, while ignoring the fact that it was the fall of the Soviet super-state that brought its secondary doom about.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that Comrade Zeskind&rsquo;s focus on that &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; mini-state&rsquo;s implosion, is in its own way, oddly positive. He is, in effect, whistling in the graveyard and ignoring an obvious fact here; had not the centralizing and totalitarian force that was the USSR not collapsed, neither would have Yugoslavia, or for that matter the global Soviet vision of &ldquo;multiculturalism.&rdquo; It is also a highly projective desire on his part (at least in my opinion,) that White Nationalists will equally ignore that obvious point, when considering a long term strategy for the future struggle of white preservation in the West.</p>
<p>This would be because the : USA, Europe Economic Union, Canada, Australia, New Zeeland, and etc. all are held together &ldquo;multi-culturally&rdquo; by similarly rigid bureaucracies and dogmas, that once held together the Soviet/Eastern Bloc. Moreover, much like the Soviet model in unnatural post-national &ldquo;unity,&rdquo; internal and external forces are corroding the assumed &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; centralized structures and leaving a power vacuum.</p>
<p>To any who observe the current &ldquo;global crisis&rdquo; situation objectively, this is only too obvious!</p>

		<p>Notice how these people describe as &#8220;inevitable&#8221; what is really nothing more than a government policy.  That&rsquo;s why when people say to me, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t just deport 12 (30, really) million Illegals, I say, &#8220;Why not, when the Feds can deliberately dispossess an entire nation?&#8221;</p>

		<p>This book is too long and too expensive; I predict it will sell poorly and go out of print quickly. Also, the author fails to explore the possibility that white Americans, once having had a taste of life under the minority occupied government of Barack Obama, might move quickly to the right a lot sooner than the predicted demographic transition.</p>

		<p>Would Mexicans want to be made a minority in their own country, would Nigerians, would Muslims? The answer of course is NO!!! All races of people want to survive.  So why should Whites want to be made a minority in their own country? Whites want to survive in the countries of their making just like every other race.</p>

  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Reality is the biggest force against a -successful- changeover to a white minority. If &#8216;successful&rsquo; means the U.S. will remain a functioning first world civilization as whites are replaced with non-whites, that will never happen. </p>
<p>The word &#8216;inevitable&rsquo; also pops up quite a bit in this article. Nothing in history is inevitable. Anything could spark a reversal of white passivity - most likely another large scale terrorist attack or two will be the trigger.</p>
<p>It certainly is comical that these people are concerned about kooks in the Ozarks, as Islam is in the initial stages of swamping the West. That demonstrates their top priority is hatred of whites.</p>

		<p>The far left seems to lose all sense of reason and proportion when thinking about the &#8220;extreme right wing,&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;sensible conservatives&#8221; like Colin Powell, David Brooks and Arianna Huffington).  The WN movement in the 60s and 70s, and by that, I mean the CCA, were trying to pour cold water on the fanatical fear of communism, because too many anti-communist whites were trying to make nice with non-whites in the process.</p>
<p>The other big error in this is that Zeskind spends too much time on gadflies Carto and Pierce, both big time egomaniacs.  He is either paranoid, or is doing that deliberately, for the same reason that Springer and Donahue love people in white sheets to come on their shows to represent WN/RRism.  Jared Taylor and the CofCC get only perfunctory references here.</p>
<p>In the same verve, I have come to understand by putting the pieces together that certain &#8220;poverty centers&#8221; and &#8220;defamation leagues&#8221; are behind the curtains peddling the silly notion that a certain 1930s German dictator didn&rsquo;t die in WWII, instead he hoofed it to Brazil with a lot of gold and other precious metals and riches stolen from the Jews during his regime, and that he&rsquo;s converting this wealth to cash and using it to fund the right wing in America and Europe.  The obvious design is to get left wingers to empty their pockets for said poverty centers and defamation leagues in order to stop this nefarious &#8220;conspiracy.&#8221;  Of course it&rsquo;s illogical, and stupid, but it&rsquo;s not irrational, i.e. it has a reason.  The German dictator would be 120 years old if he were still alive, and he with tons and tons of gold would have been as easy to spot by the Allies as the sun.</p>

		<p>When you actually contemplate what mulitculturalism is, any normal person would find it insane.  It is only Western nations doing this.  If it&rsquo;s followed to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion it means that the White race will lose control of its ability to govern itself and control it&rsquo;s own destiny.  It means every other nation in the world will remain intact.  In a couple of hundred years China will still be China and Mexico will still be Mexico.  Multiculturalism in the US is only a transition period between a declining population (Whites) and an ascending one (Hispanics).  Once they gain a majority, no more multiculturalism.   </p>

		<p><i>Jared Taylor, founder of the group American Renaissance, reveled in the pseudo-intellectual discourse of scientific racism</i></p>
<p>Notice how it&rsquo;s always &#8220;pseudo-intellectual&#8221; or &#8220;pseudoscientific,&#8221; as if the issue has been thoroughly examined and found to be on the side of egalitarianism. Of course, a thorough examination of the facts finds no such thing. Discourse on race differences is always dismissed as being &#8220;unscientific,&#8221; but if it were scientifically proven (which it has been) would that make it any more palatable to the egalitarians? Of course not! This is the reason for the debates that have been reprinted here on AR on whether race differences should even be studied by scientists! Imagine a whole field of scientific inquiry that is &#8220;off limits!&#8221; That is the way the egalitarians (socialists) want it.</p>

		<p>I work in one of those places where whites are already less than 5% of the population.  I hate every minute of it and fear for my safety; alas I need the money.  If more white people would come see what this is like (but not all at once and disturb the racial balance) their opinions would likely change to ones more similar to those here.  Sometimes I feel strange when I find myself glad for mexicans coming in (I speak spanish, not mexican) as I can understand them better than &#8220;african&#8221;-americans who in theory only speak english.</p>
<p>I barely recognize what we call western civilization where I work.  They are numerous and procreate frequently, and at young ages (supported by our tax dollars, over 60% have medicaid), while the few whites I see are old, alone, and too poor to leave.  This is our future as things stand now.</p>
<p>On a happy note, the money I earn is going towards a ranch in Wyoming and my wife and I are working on our fifth child.</p>

		<p>The nation is coming apart.  People are buying guns.  Even many white people who have American flags have thoughts of burning it since it oppresses us.  Thank God we are rising!  I&rsquo;d rather die fighting for a just cause and for my country than than suffer a slow death!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Look around to all the pockets of dysfunction in our society and you will find they are areas where whites are solidly in the minority. The future is already there in those places. Why ignore the warnings?&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been said better. Perfect in every way. However, do to the sheer force of the advancing glacier of ethnic cleansing, there are places where whites are a minority and things are not complete disfunction. Whites are just further burdened to function while being taxed to the limits of mental endurance. But no one asks or cares what they endure. Their voices are ignored, not listened to. Not just ignored but shut down. After all, they are &#8216;priviledged&rsquo; or whatever the latestest is being sold. Multiculturalism is not the end of society. In truth, it can seem counterproductive to go on too much or too specifically saying it is. For the most part, the way the game is played, multi-racialism benefits people of color. It is only the end of whites. </p>

<p>True. Multi-racialism and diversity only benefit non-whites. Here is the irony: the end of whites also means the end of non-whites. Parasites die when the host organism dies and no other host is available.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White nationalism has ALWAYS existed in Russia. When the Soviet Union was recruiting and training blacks in Russia for their surrogate wars in Africa, they were careful to keep the blacks segregated in their own areas AWAY from ethnic Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The segregation was so extreme that the Russians made Castro ship in black and mulatto hookers from Cuba for the africans.<br>

		<p>&#8220;As prologue, Zeskind recounts the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia and notes that &ldquo;in a matter of a few historical seconds,&rdquo; this multiethnic state went up in flames.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like most liberals and anti White racists, Zeskind doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about.  Yugoslavia was never, never a multiethnic state.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was a Serbian dictatorship.  Serbia was rewarded with the leadership of Yugoslavia after WW1 by the grateful British, Italian and French governments becuse the Serbs fought on the allied side in WW1 against Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>After WW2, Stalin and Churchill again rewarded the Serbs and their communist leader Tito with the leadership of Yugoslavia because Tito and the Serbs fought with the Russians, French, English and Americans against the Germans.</p>
<p>All the other groups, Croats, Slovenes, Bonsians, Montenegrens, Macedonians etc hated being under the Serbian dictatorship.</p>
<p>As soon as possible they &#8220;pulled their spears out of the roof thatch&#8221; or in modern terms, dug up the weapons they had stolen during their military service and split the unnatural geographic entity known as Yugoslavia apart, killing as many of their ancient enemies as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever come into serious political power, my fundamental rule of foreign policy would be not to side actively with a non-white country, power, potentate or principality over a white one, no matter how abhorrent I find the ideology of the other white country.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would like to add or enlarge that in this way; We ought to be able to take the useful aspects from ALL systems of government and self-management that exist or have ever been discussed.  And we would if we were nearly as intelligent as we seem to collectively be constantly claiming.</p>
<p>I am always proclaiming, writing and pushing the idea that half our problem is that we seek to preserve a near mythological set of ideals that many so-called conservatives today take to be the center of their cause.  Whatever those things typically are - and we could list them with little variation in our own lists, we inevitably end up our own worst enemy, just as Hitler and the Nazis turned out to be for the German people and the longterm reputation of the Nordic White race, which are the core of White racial identity.  And just as Christianity has done and continues to do to the White race.</p>
<p>It is like a perfect storm of self-misinterpretation with Christianity provided a perfect set of contradictory ideals to further confuse and befuddle the most developed and cultured people on the planet.  But I don&rsquo;t propose any of the other present world religions as its replacement either.  The ancient ideal of the Russians with the older than Christianity ideal of &#8220;Mother Russia&#8221; - from the more ancient mother goddess outlooks - is at the core of that peoples continued survival.</p>
<p>What White Americans lack is a sense of belonging to an old enough racial idea.  Our pre-eminent pop-culture style derived from our commerical capitalist culture has developed into a Frankenstein that is now a Black, Hip Hop Gangsta Rap hipitude with only a smattering of European culture added.  One man I knew once termed the many decade process as the &#8220;negrification&#8221; of America.</p>
<p>Can it be fixed?, I don&rsquo;t know.  But I am sure that just as much of a consensus on White racial values as our condemnation of anti-White conspiracy is going to be required.  It would be so much easier if we freed ourselves enough, shaking off old and often mistaken and polarized thinking patterns in order to begin to identify Whites with the goal of preserving our kind uppermost.  It will require a new and far more elastic sort of tolerance amongst ourselves to do that.  Question Diversity makes a very good comment that illustrates these ideas.</p>
<p>For myself, I would not mind at all calling a fellow White dedicated as I am to preserving my race and its deeper cultural identities - &#8220;Comrad.&#8221;  It is a good word, like &#8220;Brother.&#8221;  How silly for us to do just as the PC mind controllers and make words into toxic labels!</p>
<p>Today is June Sixth.  As we recall D-Day and all those brave men who stormed the beaches and fought agression - agression mainly against other White European nations - I also never forget the Russian people, who lost at least 20 million of their own in WW2.  The example of the people, all of them - men, women and children, uniting to save their &#8220;Motherland&#8221; from invasion and their own destruction is the most moving of all stories from WW2.  I so wish that Whites worldwide could unite and forget their own ancient competitions.<br>

		<p>W&rsquo;plight:</p>
<p>Expanding on what you said in reaction to my first post, I would withdraw from the UN, and see to its disintegration, and start a new trans-national organizations, only for (1) White nations, and (2) White individuals in non-white nations, e.g. South Africa, Zimbabwe, and others.  The working title would be Organization of White Nations (OWN), and as a measure of good will to the Russians we seem to want to anger for no reason at all, I would base it in Moscow.  Any nuclear missile defense system would be OWN-owned (no pun int&rsquo;d), and would be for the explicit purpose of defending any white member nation against a nuclear missile launch by a non-white nation, group, principality, or terrorist organization, and also to keep future white Hitlers in check by striking down nuclear missiles launched by whites against other whites.</p>
<p>While it is a transnationalist proposal, it is hardly a globalist proposal, because OWN would not be universal to all human beings, or pretend to be.</p>

		<p>26 Question Diversity: Excellent idea.  An Organization of White Nations, established to preserve that 10 percent of humanity for whom the ideals of the U.N. might have made any sense at all.  Any outfit that includes North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, and any other sewer pipe of a country that has a flag and a supply of AK-47s, is not something that any civilized nation should belong to.  </p>
