			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Georg Schreuder Hes, Radio Netherlands, June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Children of the first wave of migrant workers who arrived in Europe in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s are doing worse in school than their peers in their countries of origin, reports de Volkskrant.</p>
<p>This negative effect is not limited to children of migrant workers from Mediterranean. Children born to French or German immigrants also do worse than their counterparts in France or Germany.</p>
<p>However, the reverse is true in the United States and Canada, said educational sociologists Jaap Dronkers and Manon de Heus who conducted research into the educational achievements of migrant children.</p>
<p>In an interview with the paper, Dronkers said: &#8220;The wait-and-see attitude of a society seeps through into its educational system. In many European countries, migrants are asked: Do you really belong here?</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand everybody is factually an immigrant. They have a much more open attitude towards newcomers. At the same time they impose restrictions: only people who stand a chance in the labour market are admitted. This means that those who do arrive are well-motivated&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sociologist will present their findings at the European University Institute in Florence later this week.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Radio Netherlands, May 11, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A new study shows second generation Turkish children do better in other European countries than in the Netherlands, reports De Volkskrant.</p>
<p>One third of Turkish children in the Netherlands and Germany drop out of school early as compared to less than 10 percent in Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium.</p>
<p>According to the study of seven European countries on second generation integration, the Dutch education system is to blame for Turkish pupils leaving school early with very low qualifications.</p>
<p>In other countries such as France, children follow the same education until the age of 15.</p>
<p>However, children in the Netherlands are streamed into different education paths at the age of 12, making it a disadvantage to second-generation children whose lower-than- average language abilities mean they often excel at a later age.</p>
<p>Another reason cited by the paper was the age where children are allowed to leave school after receiving their basic education. At 16, students receive a diploma and many do not continue with their studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixteen is a risky age for dropping out of school. Pupils are right in the middle of puberty,&#8221; said researcher Maurice Krul.</p>
<p>Education plays an important role in integration as it determines success on the job market, reports the paper.</p>
<p>The study was commissioned by the Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies in Amsterdam.<br>

		<p>While Turks overall aren&rsquo;t that good in academics, I notice that they&rsquo;re the worst in the most liberal countries.  The reason I think is that they don&rsquo;t think they need to do well in school, because whitey and his welfare system will be there for them for live.</p>
<p>Are we to think that if we force 16-year olds into school for two more years, that they&rsquo;ll be so much better?  And in this day and age, with puberty onset coming earlier, 16 is the end of, not the middle of, puberty.  Non-whites hit it earlier as a measure of central tendency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about to change, but in the UK, if you have no post-secondary abilities or ambitions, you&rsquo;re done with school at 16, and then can pretty much live as an adult.  You can join the Armed Forces at 16 for that reason.  But that&rsquo;s about to change, that next decade, the dropout age goes to 18.</p>

		<p>The reasons fewer Turks drop out of school in Sweden is because the Swedish education system is extremely dumbed down. Its basically extended daycare for young adults with the aim of reducing unemployment among young people. Students who are too dumb to follow regular coursework are given a reduced curriculum to compensate for their lack of mental abilities. </p>

<p>Huh? All you have to do is look at the results of blacks in North America to realize that they (and Hispanics and aboriginals) cannot compete academically with whites and Asians. It&rsquo;s heredity, and not geography, that&rsquo;s the real issue here.</p>

		<p>One of the many fallacies of forced multi culture ideology is the presumption people of illiterate undeveloped nations can be transplanted into the modern nations and be instantly changed by the move.  The truth is they bring their history/background with them.  Then they blame the transferred culture on their un-scholastic failures.  Then they go on government entitlements and live happily ever after.   V</p>

<p>Using that standard, every person in every country is an immigrant.  All countries are countries of immigrants, because the whole history of human civilization can be summed up in the consequences that become a people getting up from one place, moving to another, and perhaps encountering people that are already there.</p>

		<p>Most of the immigrants to Canada come from India, China, Pakistan and the Philippines.  Blacks from Africa and the Caribbean do poorly in Canadian schools, but the first groups fare better, as they are often very motivated by an impatient agenda to out-perform the host.  </p>
<p>Being well educated doesn&rsquo;t equate to ethics, morals, or values. Many well-educated foreigners are quite prepared to break laws (for example smuggling and drug selling), or commit fraud against the Canadian system to get ahead quickly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a sixth generation Australian - when some fool tries the immigrant comment on me, I always ask for an explanation. For example,&#8221;How can a person whose family has been here since the 1820s possibly be an immigrant, please explain this to me. My parents, their parents and their parents were born here, back to the 1820s, how are we &#8216;immigrants&rsquo;?&#8221;.</p>
<p>You know what - never once have I heard an explanation. Never once have a gotten a sensible answer. It&rsquo;s just meaningless gibberish (along the same lines as &#8216;Race is just a social construct&rsquo;) and should be treated as such. I always ask for a definition of this kind of nonsense, and I&rsquo;ve never gotten one, not once.</p>

		<p>I am an American living in Germany.<br>
I live in a Turkish neighborhood (where crime rates, incidentally, very low by American standards.) </p>
<p>Missing from such articles is a frank discussion of the intellectual ability of Turkish immigrants. Turkey itself has an average IQ of ca 90.<br>
The average ethnic German has an IQ of ca 107.<br>
But most Turkish immigrants to Germany are under average by Turkish standards.<br>
Many of them are on the mental level of a 10-year-old German, and are hence virtually unemployable here in any but the most menial jobs.<br>
They are doomed to fail in Germany, to determine welfare recipients and/or minimum-wage part-timers. </p>
<p>In a sense, the situation is comparable to that of Mexican immigration into the United States: <br>
we are not getting the high the educated upper-middle-class, we are getting the low-end of the population mentally.</p>
<p>Assimilation only works if individuals are in roughly the same range as the host country.</p>
<p>Blaming schools is absolutely stupid.</p>

		<p>It has to do with natural abilities as well as the value placed on education by the parents. With immigrants  here in the USA it depends. Asians do very well but latinos don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the same in all countries.</p>

		<p>Turks are not exactly the brightest lights in the room.  They do not perform well in countries with high IQ&rsquo;s or educational systems that require rigorous coursework.  The Turks should come to ObamaLand where a 6th grade education will get you into any University at the tax payers expense.</p>

		<p>Everyone in America is an immigrant?</p>
<p>Not me!  Every single one of my &#8216;arriving&rsquo; ancestors came here before the Revolutionary War. A few arrived twelve thousand years ago, via the Bering Strait.   So far, two little Neocon Republicans have tried the &#8220;You&rsquo;re an immigrant, too..&#8221; approach with me. Both quickly came to deeply regret their foolish statements.</p>
<p>But to sum up this article from Radio Netherlands: immigrant children do less well in the Netherlands, because that country has yet to dumb-down its system of education to accomodate them.</p>
