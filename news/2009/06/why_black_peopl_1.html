<h1>Why Black People Need More Vitamin D</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Villarosa, The Root, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vitamin D may be the most important supplement you&rsquo;re not taking  &mdash;  or not taking enough of. Most of us  &mdash;  and even our doctors  &mdash;  have little idea that taking regular amounts of it may help stave off some of the most common life-threatening illnesses.</p>
<p>Best known for building bones and preventing rickets  &mdash;  a bone disease more common in the days of Charles Dickens than today  &mdash;  vitamin D has recently been shown to lower the risk of diabetes, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, memory loss and several types of cancer.</p>
<p>Despite this good news, most Americans don&rsquo;t get near enough vitamin D. And among African Americans, some experts have called vitamin D deficiency a &#8220;hidden epidemic&#8221; and have speculated that low levels are to blame for higher rates of diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes. The Chicago Sun-Times went even further, linking African-American death rates from aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancer to low levels of vitamin D.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To help sort through the vitamin D maze, we spoke to Dr. Consuelo Hopkins Wilkins, an assistant professor of medicine and psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who has spent nearly a decade studying this overlooked vitamin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[The Root]: Why are African Americans particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency?</p>
<p>[Dr. Consuelo Hopkins Wilkins]: Melanin protects the skin against ultraviolet light. But by blocking the sun&rsquo;s rays, melanin affects the skin&rsquo;s ability to activate pre-vitamin D. So the darker the skin, the less vitamin D you produce. In the scientific literature, the difference is striking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>TR: Can you get enough D from your diet?</p>
<p>CHW: It&rsquo;s hard; vitamin D is something the body was meant to make. I&rsquo;m a strong proponent of vitamin D, so I recommend supplements.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a nurse.  There is a little more to this story than less absorbtion of Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Blacks have very dense, thick and strong bones, much denser than Whites or Asians.  This is good, because it makes them less dependent on outside sources such as Vitamin D, sunshine and calcium for bone strength.</p>
<p>It is true that dark skin absorbs less Vitamin D.  But Vitamin D and calcium are useful primarily for maintaining bone strength.</p>
<p>Blacks have excellent strong bones and don&rsquo;t need the sun exposure, calcium and Vitamin D that Whites and Asians do.</p>
<p>As for the rest, lack of Vitamin D causes diabetes, hypertenstion, and the rest of the nonsense, it sounds very much like an advertising campaign for the Vitamin industry, something like blueberries and pomengrante juice prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Lack of Vitamin D causes bone loss and porosity leading to various bone diseases.</p>

		<p>Black women have higher bone density and, much lower rates of osteoporosis than white women, so maybe they do not need as much vitamin D</p>

		<p>Everyone should take 3000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily. It has been shown to prevent colds, flus and even cancer.</p>

		<p>I demand that our Lord and Savior, Barrack Hussein Obama, appoint a Vitamin Czar immediately, before all of our hard working, self reliant, non crime committing African American citizens get rickets and have to quit working and shamefully accept handouts from white taxpayers. </p>

		<p>Blacks have natural defenses against malaria but don&rsquo;t do well in cloudy northern climates because of Vitamin D deficiency. Whites get sunburn in tropical climates which reduces daily quality of life.</p>
<p>Imagine what black neighborhoods in Detroit or Chicago would look like with no Vitamin D milk. Then imagine what white enclaves in places like East Texas or Arizona would look like without Air Conditioning. </p>
<p>Is nature telling us something? </p>

		<p>It is well known in Afrocentric studies that Vitamin D is what gave the ancient Africans their super powers. When Africans had a plentyful supply of Vitamin D, they were able to create classical music, math, motorized hang gliders, and democracy. The White devil is now denyiing African Americans of Vitamin D, out of fear of a Black Cultural Revolution.</p>

		<p>For Madison Grant: I have to take 50,000 IU of vitamin D every other day because of a total thyroidectomy (papillary cancer) which the surgeon also removed the four parathyroids.  The parathyroids are needed for calcium absorption into the bloodstream.  I know from first-hand experience how important the combination of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C and magnesium is to keep your nervious system functioning normally as well as healthy bones.  Having seizures and constant &#8220;pins and needles&#8221; sensations is no fun.</p>
<p>But I have to warn our readers that taking too much vitamin D can be deadly.  And striking the exact balance of pills to take is a bit of an art under a doctor&rsquo;s care and lots of needle sticks.  So unless your doctor advise otherwise, take the recommended daily dose.</p>
