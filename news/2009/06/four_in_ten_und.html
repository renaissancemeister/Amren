<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1195323/Four-20s-London-arent-white.html">Four in Ten Under-20s in London Aren&rsquo;t White </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), June 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four out of ten young people in London are members of ethnic minorities, it was revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>A government report found that more than 700,000 children and teenagers are classed as non-white, around 40 per cent of the age group in the capital.</p>
<p>At present, just over a third of Londoners of all ages are reckoned to be non-white  &mdash;  but the new figures indicate that this share will grow substantially in the future.</p>
<p>They also point to the way recent waves of immigration have made a bigger impact on London than other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The analysis from the Office for National Statistics said that in the West Midlands, the second most multi-racial area of the country after London, just 19 per cent of children and teenagers are non-white. </p>
<p>The figures were disclosed in Whitehall&rsquo;s annual Regional Trends report. </p>
<p>They drew warnings from migration experts that politicians are taking a risk by ignoring the changing nature of cities and suburbs. </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think-tank said: &#8216;This illustrates the massive change that is taking place to our society at a rapid pace and without the indigenous population ever being consulted. </p>
<p>&#8216;It is high time that the political class took their heads out of the clouds and responded to the very strong public opinion that wants to bring immigration under control.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Many of the migrants who have come into Britain in the past ten years have settled in London. </p>
<p>Three London boroughs have had majority ethnic minority populations since the turn of the Millennium  &mdash;  Newham, Tower Hamlets and Brent  &mdash;  and others are likely to see whites become a minority in the near future. </p>
<p>The estimates yesterday put the under-20 ethnic minority population of London at 714,000. </p>
<p>Around 15 per cent of young Londoners are classed as Asian or Asian British, it said, and 14 per cent black or black British. </p>
<p>Lowest populations of ethnic minority youngsters were in the North-East  &mdash;  five per cent of all people under 20  &mdash;  and in the South-West, at six per cent. </p>
<p>The all-party Balanced Migration group of MPs said that 70 per cent of future population increase and 40 per cent of new households will be a result of immigration. </p>
<p>In a statement, the group&rsquo;s co-chairmen, Labour MP Frank Field and Tory Nicholas Soames, said: &#8216;As we face severe cuts in public spending, it is the politics of madness to continue with immigration policies that will mean us having to provide thousands of new homes for newcomers  &mdash;  not to mention the necessary roads, schools and hospitals  &mdash;  on this unprecedented scale, when our own citizens, both black and white, cannot get homes.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This is the England that so many good men fought for in WW2? I wonder what those R.A.F. pilots defending London during the blitz would have thought if they had only known this was what was going to happen to the city they were fighting and dying for? How sad! Call it Hitler&rsquo;s revenge. The British wiped out him but the Labour party wiped out England.</p>

		<p>700,000 under age-20 non-Whites in London! Wow! When Enoch Powell made his prophetic speech in 1968 there were only 800,000 non-Whites in all of Britain. Then again in 1948 whne Labour let them in there were only 7,000. Such an avoidable tragedy.</p>

		<p>It appears that Democracy has been a disaster for England. The country lasted for centuries under hereditary rule, and now, after a few centuries of democracy, seems destined for destruction. It is clear that a system in which narcissistic psychopaths are elected as rulers is unsustainable. They rule via the IBG (I&rsquo;ll be gone) guiding principle, and drive the country to destruction.</p>
<p>It seems like a wild idea, but I suspect that a modified hereditary leadership scheme might work better for Europeans. A scheme in which the king has multiple wives, selected eugenically, and many children, and in which he selects his most talented son as his successor.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why there is a BNP, and anybody who cares about the future of Britain ought to vote for them, but the sort of liberals who villify the BNP will unfortunately see the error of their way of thinking when it is way too late. </p>

		<p>And what is the Daily Mail&rsquo;s solution?  Bash the only part that wants to do something about it, the BNP, and support the Tory Party.  Half the Muslims in England are there, so it seems, at the explicit invitation of Margaret Thatcher, because of their supposed &#8220;family values&#8221; (sound familiar?) and to spite the Soviet Union.  Which of course the USSR was so evil that the UK had to allow itself to be flooded with non-whites.  This is why I would never side with a non-white country over a white country even if the other white country was the ideological polar opposite of me.</p>

		<p>I visited London several years ago. Not once on the streets and on the tube (subway) did I hear anybody speaking English! Granted, this was the summer and the height of the tourist season, but even so, this was England! I can&rsquo;t say I want to go back to London again - it&rsquo;s definitely not a place to savor traditional British culture.</p>

		<p>This really saddens me because it&rsquo;s so unnecessary.  There&rsquo;s no good reason England should have let in millions of 3rd Worlders.  Why did it?  Can anyone provide a coherent answer to this question?  <br>
Throughout history White people fought to the death to save our  homelands from invaders. Flash-forward to the late 20th and early 21st century and you find these once proud White nations  inviting those same invaders with open arms.<br>
However, nothing is set in stone.  We still have time to take our countries back.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain that the 40% is a deliberate under-estimate issued by the Home Office, which has a long and deceitful history in deliberately falsifying immigration statistics.<br>
  Eyewitness evidence indicates a non-White majority in London.<br>
Other statistics indicate that 51% of London schoolchildren have English as a second language.Considering that there are at least as many 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants as 1st generation, and that carribean blacks (there are an enormous number of them) speak English as a mother tongue,I leave you to draw your own conclusion about the veracity of these statistics.<br>
  Suffice to say that London will face an ever accelerating trend of White racial displacement, that in a generation or so&rsquo;s time will produce spectacular results - to the extent that London will be around 80% non-White by the 2030s.</p>

<p>VOTERS!! the same reason our politicians that are IN office and want to STAY IN OFFICE allow illegals and anyone else in so they will vote to KEEP THEM IN, at least until the immigrants have enough clout to elect IMMIGRANTS!</p>

		<p>Kenelm Digby is (as usual) quite right. As a Londoner born and bred I can confirm his eyewitness report.</p>
<p>Bear in mind also that many (if not most) of the few whites you will see here will not be native-born Anglo-Saxons. There is a fairly significant number of Australasians and white South Africans (whose presence I do not resent), but they do not always put down roots here, unlike the non-white hordes who invariably do. There are also Poles and people from the Baltic states (whom again I do not resent). But there are also Kosovo Albanians, Turks (whom our establishment bizarrely consider &#8220;white&#8221;), Latin Americans and of course that great advance guard of English-hating mass immigrants, the Irish Catholics (not to mention the dreaded Roma, who cannot sensibly be considered white).</p>
<p>The destruction of our major cities by mass non-white (especially Muslim) immigration (with white immigration as an intentionally distracting background noise) is part of a planned process of decapitation (orchestrated by Common Purpose and its affiliates - the local arm of the NWO). London, the largest city in Europe, is already predominantly non-white, and will become more so very rapidly.</p>

<p>Yeah, right.  &#8220;The public&#8221; has no say in this.  I&rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&rsquo;t fight back, but we can&rsquo;t expect politicians to make things better.  Very few of them are on our side.  </p>

		<p>The Beatles wrote a song called No Pakistanis that would have served as a warning about all this.  They chickened out however, and changed the words and called the song Get Back.  The words &#8220;get back to where you once belonged&#8221; referred in the original version to Pakistanis getting back to where they once belonged.  Later the Beatles tried to say the original words were a parody of the Powell speech, but in fact they were serious at the time about it because they recognized that unchecked immigration would destroy London.  And they were right.</p>

		<p>This is what I don&rsquo;t get.  Is there still wide scale immigration into Europe?  Paul Gottfried seems to think so (https://hbdbooks.com/?p=434)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not entirely optimistic about what happened in the recent European elections.  The results showed that conventional party blocs have held on to power in most of the larger European countries.  Indeed in Germany no party outside the multicultural Left and its Union accomplices did very well.  The smaller Western countries, led by Austria, of course provide more cause for optimism but here we are dealing with small places, unlike England, France and Germany, where the pro-immigration, pro-feminist Left, masquerading as &ldquo;center-right,&rdquo;  now rule in cooperation with the more blatantly leftist parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a commentator writes that that&rsquo;s not the case.  Which is true?</p>

		<p>It always makes me laugh when i hear london described as a &#8220;marvellous melting-pot of races&#8221;  &mdash;  it is no such thing. it is rapidly becoming a nightmare of a place for whites. even the good old cockney accent is being replaced by a horrid, jamaican-type dialect that the white kids think is so cool  &mdash;  i am so glad i don&rsquo;t live there.</p>
