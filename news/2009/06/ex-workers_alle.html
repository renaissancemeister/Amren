<h1><a href="https://www.mddailyrecord.com/article.cfm?id=11638&amp;type=UTTM">Ex-Workers Allege Race-Based Loan Approach at Wells Fargo</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brendan Kearney, Daily Record (Loyola College), June 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Baltimore has beefed up its groundbreaking racial discrimination lawsuit against Wells Fargo with sometimes shocking testimony from a pair of the megabank&rsquo;s former subprime-loan officers.</p>
<p>The two whistleblowers claim their co-workers targeted black ZIP codes and churches, used software to &#8220;translate&#8221; marketing materials into African-American vernacular, and referred to subprime loans in minority communities as &#8220;ghetto loans&#8221; and to borrowers as &#8220;mud people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The loan officers, who worked for Wells Fargo in the Baltimore-Washington area from the late 1990s until 2007, also alleged bank employees deceptively steered prime borrowers into subprime loans for their own financial benefit and joked that they were &#8220;riding the stagecoach to Hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It cites 10 studies, including one specific to Baltimore, which studied reverse-redlining in black neighborhoods; and updated the foreclosure data to include the first part of 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief Judge Benson E. Legg scheduled the June 29 hearing, despite having already received hundreds of pages of filings and having heard from lawyers for the city and the San Francisco-based lender three times in open court, to make a final determination about whether the city has enough evidence to warrant moving forward with the discovery phase of the case.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s attorneys, who include fair-housing specialists from Washington, D.C., argue such a hearing is an improper and highly prejudicial &#8220;mini-trial&#8221; that would &#8220;serve no point&#8221; in light of its amended complaint.</p>
<p>The city has alleged Wells Fargo targeted minority neighborhoods and borrowers for high-rate subprime loans  &mdash;  a practice known as reverse red-lining, which is illegal under the federal Fair Housing Act, according to the city&rsquo;s legal team. The city wants tens of millions of dollars to compensate for the collateral costs of Wells Fargo&rsquo;s foreclosures, such as increased police and fire department expenditures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked extremely hard to make homeownership possible for more African-American borrowers and all customer segments, and we have done so fairly and responsibly,&#8221; Wells Fargo spokesman Kevin Waetke wrote in an e-mailed statement late Monday. &#8220;We absolutely do not tolerate team members treating our customers disrespectfully or unfairly, or who violate our ethics and lending policies. Race is never a factor in the pricing or products we offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city cited vacancy statistics showing that, of 379 foreclosures on Wells Fargo loans between 2005 and 2008, 222 were vacant after the Wells Fargo loan was &#8220;originated&#8221; and 107 remain vacant at present.</p>

		<p>If Wells Fargo did in fact discriminate against blacks who did not qualify for home loans, then that might be why Wells Fargo is far and away in the best shape of all of the banks.</p>

		<p>So you can&rsquo;t redline. You can&rsquo;t reverse redline. Sounds like a typical day dealing with blacks. Wells Fargo reaps the reward of pandering to diversity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;high rate subprime loans&#8221;   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s a contradiction.  Sub prime means under the prime rate, i.e. they were ARMs with deceptively low teaser rates.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another contradiction:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We have worked extremely hard to make homeownership possible for more African-American borrowers and all customer segments, and we have done so fairly and responsibly,&rdquo; Wells Fargo spokesman Kevin Waetke wrote in an e-mailed statement late Monday. &ldquo;We absolutely do not tolerate team members treating our customers disrespectfully or unfairly, or who violate our ethics and lending policies. Race is never a factor in the pricing or products we offer.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>You can plainly see that &#8220;making home ownership possible for more&#8221; blacks and &#8220;fairly,&#8221; &#8220;responsibly,&#8221; &#8220;not violating lending polices or ethics&#8221; is a contradiction.</p>

		<p>The bank discriminated against blacks, or people who live in certain areas, by giving loan preferences to whites? Is there a white person on this Earth who would feel sympathy for them?</p>

		<p>For some reason this strikes me as strange. Wells Fargo (which has been my bank for 5 years now) is one of the most multiculturally sensitive companies out there. Every branch that I have been to here in Utah have been staffed nearly completely by minorities and all signage is in English and Spanish. There are special rates to wire money to Mexico and special accounts for customers without a SS#. Since all newborns in the US are assigned a SS#, this tells me they are catering to illegals. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The two whistleblowers claim&#8221; That&rsquo;s all you need right there.  Would this kind of hearsay even be printed if it were Whites claiming bias from blacks/mestizos.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bank alleged to have discriminated against blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how the world economic crash began.</p>
<p>As long as a country has blacks, it will never be able to succeed at anything.  Everything will always involve some kind of racial thing.</p>

		<p>I do not believe for one minute the racial slurs mentioned in the article were actually used. My mother has been a banker for 25 years, so I know for a fact that this behavior would never be tolerated in a professional banking environment.</p>
<p>These &#8220;whistleblowers&#8221; are, I suspect, paid shills.</p>
