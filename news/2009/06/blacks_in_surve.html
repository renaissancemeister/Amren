<h1>Blacks in Survey Say Race Relations No Better With Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-Americans really like President Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office, a new national poll found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the 2008 election, 38 percent of blacks surveyed thought racial discrimination was a serious problem. In the new survey, 55 percent of blacks surveyed believed it was a serious problem, which is about the same level as it was in 2000.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted May 16-18, in telephone interviews with 505 African-Americans and 501 whites.</p>
<p>Blacks and whites had differing opinions of Obama&rsquo;s performance. More than 60 percent of blacks felt that Obama met their expectations, while 46 percent of whites did.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of blacks said Obama exceeded their expectations, compared with 16 percent of whites. Six percent of blacks said Obama did not meet expectations, compared with 35 percent of whites.</p>
<p>Both blacks and whites gave similar answers to a survey question about whether race relations will always be a problem in the United States.</p>
<p>Forty-five percent of blacks answered yes, while 42 percent of whites said yes. Fifty percent of blacks said no, while 56 percent of whites said no.</p>
<p>The poll had a sampling error on these questions of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.</p>

		<p>Whites need to understand this: There is nothing they can do to ever make Blacks stop hating Whites.  Whites can spend Trillions and Trillions of Dollars over decades.  Whites can provide every type of subsidy to Blacks from free prenatal care to free day care, to free education, to midnight basketball, to food stamps to Section Eight Housing, to welfare to free medical care, transportation and Affirmative Action jobs, and it will not make one difference. Whites can create special Black holidays, name streets after famous blacks, put blacks on postage stamps and in every movie and TV show.  Whites can even elect a Black to the Presidency and it will not solve racial conflict.  </p>
<p>The only thing that will eliminate racial conflict between Blacks and Whites in the USA is when all Whites are finally gone.  This can be quickly accomplished through massive immigration from the Third World.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;More blacks think race relations unimproved now than in 2008.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they thought it would be because………..No what they want is more race-based AA, more favors, more jobs in their favor at the expense of everyone else. That is what they want. They don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s tales about improving relations with non-black people what so ever, much less white people.  They thought they were going to get something for nothing from Whitey that is what they thought. <br/>

		<p>And there you have it. Blacks are apparently unsatisfied with having the highest office in the land. I guess they won&rsquo;t be happy until every major office is occupied by a black person: president, all congressmen/senators, and every cabinet post. I find it interesting blacks think that discrimination is worse since Obama got elected. One could easily assume it&rsquo;s because they now believe that the whole country and every single thing in it belongs to them (the same way that an African president owns everything in his country) and so if they don&rsquo;t get what they want it&rsquo;s clearly a sign of rampant discrimination. But that&rsquo;s just my analysis, I&rsquo;m sure that if the media touches on this story they will be quick to assure me it&rsquo;s because racist white people (i.e. all white people) are just being bigots who are frightened of blacks taking over there country.</p>

As I predicted. Not only would race relations not improve but they would be said to get worse.</p>
<p>When blacks don&rsquo;t get what they want (full, unconditional control), they scream racism. That they haven&rsquo;t been given everything they dreamed of, that people oppose their views, opinions, and solutions is only greater proof that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is stopping them from achieving their true greatness.</p>
<p>A black man in the White House is not going to do anything to convince blacks that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is what is allegedly keeping them down.</p>
<p>Being turn down for reparations is going to be another hit for race relations.</p>

		<p>Race relations will never improve according to blacks because their false accusations of white racism, is their meal ticket. Without white guilt the hundreds of billions of dollars that are transferred from Whites to blacks would dry up. Our current recession/depression is mainly due to this transfer of wealth from productive whites to those who exhibit little or no productivity. The programs which rob whites include Fannie Mae, and the Community Reinvestment act. </p>

<p>This just seems obvious to me.  Blacks just expected Obama to be black, so that on top of his anti-white race-pandering has &#8220;exceeded their expectations&#8221;.  Whites were actually deluded enough to think he might be a halfway decent president, so obviously they think he has been subpar.</p>

		<p>Race relations have never been good and they know it. A multiracial nation will never survive and we know it. Blacks seem to be even more violent since Obama took office. So what does that tell us? </p>

		<p>It should be interesting to see how blacks&rsquo; impressions of Obama change over time. Despite his overtly race-conscious autobiography,  church and background, Obama has acted pretty much like a typical, garden variety liberal as president. As Jared Taylor has said, compared to how, say, Hillary Clinton would have acted in office, there isn&rsquo;t much difference. If blacks expected reparations or forty acres and a mule, they will be disappointed.</p>

		<p>Could it be that race relations are no better,I would say even worse) because sociopathic black behavior seems to have ramped up ever since the election.<br/>
Most people of all races other than Black were expecting a Renaissance or an Epiphany on the part of Blacks now that one of their own had earned the most powerful position on Earth. It appears that they have inferred that they have Carte Blanche to do whatever the Hell the want. And they are doing it.</p>

		<p>I think the most important thing to take away from this is that during the Bush years, the so called, white person&rsquo;s party did more than the democrats ever did to steal from whites to give to blacks.</p>
<p>Which is why white people should NOT support the republican party and should, instead, give rise to a white nationalist party.  Such a party, if it got off the ground would quickly overtake both the republican and democratic parties.  Because the sad fact of the matter is, most white people do NOT vote because neither party represents them.  If that were to change, then most white people WOULD vote.  Voter apathy is not the problem.  Lack of leadership and organizations that support white causes, is the problem.</p>
<p>The US needs its own version of the BNP.  If we had that it would be FAR more popular here, almost instantly, then the BNP is in Britain.  So much so that it could change the political landscape forever.</p>

<p>I tend to doubt it.  They basically got that in South Africa and it has not stopped the whining, as Amren posted recently:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2009/06/in_south_africa_1.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/06/in_south_africa_1.php</a></p>
<p>In fact, in line with what sbuffalonative has said, total black political control would almost certainly exacerbate black grievances. This is because, once the promised riches fail to materialize (and blacks will never blame their own government), the only ones left to blame are the individual whites themselves, for being unfairly successful, i.e. for their &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;  Again, see South Africa (and Zimbabwe) for examples of this principle in action.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-Americans really like President Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office, a new national poll found.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, of course, being not too bright, and arrogant to boot, they don&rsquo;t understand that the reason for the lack of better race relations is because black conduct hasn&rsquo;t really changed, and, in many instances, has gotten worse.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t we just have an article on here indicating black male crime is worse now than it was just a few years ago?</p>
<p>But, besides that, wasn&rsquo;t it written by some astute observers on here that the overall black situation won&rsquo;t change much by having a black as president?  And, further, that many blacks probably will turn on Obama when they slowly realize that they&rsquo;re still dropping out of school at the same rate, have the same high crime rate, and they&rsquo;re still not competent enough to work anythng but the menial jobs, except for the AA gimmes in government?</p>
<p>Remember the pro-Obama black on T.V. saying now that Obama is pres he would get a free car and a house?</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for them when I realize how dense so many of them are.</p>
<p>But I forget about it when I read where another black mob attacked a lone or a few whites and the authorities are saying there&rsquo;s no hate crimes involved.</p>
<p>With them here, this country has been a mess.</p>

Peggy the Moocher stated clearly what blacks expect from obama:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I never thought this day would happen. I won&rsquo;t have to work on puttin&rsquo; gas in my car. I won&rsquo;t have to work at payin&rsquo; my mortgage. You know. If I help him [Obama], he&rsquo;s gonna help me&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with power, it is MONEY (for nothing) that blacks want  &mdash;  they also expect obama to harshly punish Whites for any perceived historical crimes by bleeding their wealth and demanding that it be transferred to them (well, obama IS working on this). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, blacks are being further marginalized as the hispanic third world continues to pour into California, expelling blacks, often through violence, from their &#8216;historical&rsquo; areas, taking up all the low-skilled jobs, taking over formerly black schools, taking over local and state politics.  </p>
<p>Do they think hispanics feel ANY guilt over the &#8216;legacy&rsquo; of slavery and will &#8216;honor&rsquo; AA policies that favor them?  When will they realize there will never be a Rainbow Coalition?  </p>
<p>According to City Journal:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Surveys show that many US Hispanics mistrust African-Americans and see themselves as more like whites than like blacks&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>None of this is as important as searching out and punishing The Great White Bigot.</p>

		<p>The poll indicates that minorities say race relations have neither improved or gotten worse. At least it shows that blacks can be more realistic than a lot of race-realists. The kind who say a black man as president is the end of the white world.</p>

		<p>As someone who is half-black, I have a confession to make on several points.  If you are so inclined, please feel free to paste this missive  &mdash;  my two cents  &mdash;  - and send this to your like-minded, or, more likely, un-like-minded friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>Without appearing to be pollyanna, or to fail in acknowledging  that there are exceptions, I would say this:</p>
<p>1.  Whites are the least racist of all people&hellip;Let&rsquo;s be purely objective, here:  In the Middle Ages, when the Europeans were building the magnificent cathedrals in Europe, blacks in Africa didn&rsquo;t have the concept of a wheel.  Whites could have easily taken their multi-faceted propensities for world improvement and kept it to themselves&hellip;</p>
<p>Technology, health, education, finance, science, communications, the catalyic converter&hellip;These are only a few examples of the many inventions that whites have selflessly given to the entire world&hellip;Need I mention the cure and treatments for numerous diseases?  Who developed these and shared them with the world, Nigerians?</p>
<p>If there were a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221;, there could have easily been a concerted effort to keep these improvements among whites alone.  But, notwithstanding prejudices or propensities, which we all have, whites have endeavored  &mdash;  -bent over backwards  &mdash;  - to improve the lot of all people  &mdash;  -even, strangely enough, at the expense of themselves.</p>
<p>Believe me, Blacks and Hispanics are not so altruistic; Whites are.</p>
<p>2.  Whites owe nothing to Blacks.  I personally find that even whites who may have a certain reserve towards Blacks&hellip;with good reasons, are open to decent people of any background; it is the blacks, taken collectively, who are unyielding in their attitudes.  We could argue that Blacks&hellip;and Hispanics, owe Whites.  But let&rsquo;s just call it even and go on with our lives.</p>
<p>3.  Even though I&rsquo;m very young, I want to say, it is not the responsibility of the government to &#8220;improve&#8221; race relations, as such.  Do not look to the President for your &#8220;temporal salvation&#8221;.  Hard work, frugality, morality, honesty, creativity&hellip;These things will go take you much farther in life than a social re-engineering bill emanating from the powers that be in Washington.  Don&rsquo;t count on government  &mdash;  -either party  &mdash;  -to do what you should do for yourself.</p>
<p>4.  Every man is responsible for himself.  He is the ultimate arbiter of his own actions and the resultant consequences thereto.  Unjust discrimination has existed, I don&rsquo;t deny this, and there are very negative consequences which can arise from it.  But it is a non-sequitor to argue that the drug use, std rate, health problems, joblessness, lawlessness, out of wedlock births, promiscuity, laziness, general immorality, criminality, dishonesty, racism (yes, racism), within the Black community can all be attributed to the &#8220;White man&#8221;.    </p>
<p>5.  One thing I will say that Whites need to stop doing&hellip;and all of you young people reading this, take note.  Stop putting yourselves down. Stop apologizing for things you never did and for things which may  &mdash;  -or may not have happened in the past.  When your teachers put down your race  &mdash;  -strangely again, usually white teachers, take a stand.  You&rsquo;ll find that liberals generally have no backbone; that&rsquo;s why their liberals. You do not bear a collective responsibility in any sense for past mistreatment and don&rsquo;t let anyone put it on you.  Just as Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t tolerate people &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; them, neither should you.</p>
<p>This all having been said, enjoy the upcoming 4th of July holiday.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;In the new survey, 55 percent of blacks surveyed believed it was a serious problem, which is about the same level as it was in 2000.&#8221;</p>
<p>What morons our African American &#8220;neighbors&#8221; are!  There is a very severe recession, my brutha!  People of all hues laid off. Many whites have lost jobs; blacks with less education often didn&rsquo;t have fulltime jobs anyway and those that did are less qualified in the majority of cases. Even our brown latino friends have had in some cases had to return to Mexico, a violation of civil rights if there ever was one.  </p>
<p>So you, exploited descendent of slaves, get fired because the bankers stole the money and the economy is starved for capital.(We won&rsquo;t talk about Franklin Raines and the role of black &#8220;bankers&#8221; in the crash)</p>
<p> All too complicated for the average black to understand. So pull out the old reliable excuse, &#8220;white&#8221; racism(does &#8220;white&#8221; include Hindus, Iranians, Jews and Chinese who are thriving in the USA?). </p>
<p>BTW, what do blacks think about the negative role of &#8220;their&#8221; President, half-white extreme neo-Weatherman leftist Obama, pumping trillions into banks and investment houses that aren&rsquo;t reinvesting the capital into the economy? Haven&rsquo;t heard about that, DeQwan?  I know. That newspaper or financial website is so HARD to read.</p>

		<p>Anonomoyous:Obama is doing a good job, but not a perfect one. He has to head off a repeat of the Great Depression,which was caused by runaway deflation.A little inflation down the road is better than what happened in the 1930s. I hope you dont think that Bush did a good job.He transformed the largest budget surplus ever into the largest deficit up until that time.I dont like Obamas choice for the Supreme Court, either.Maybe she can be beaten back.You made a good point about the population Ponzi Scheme.I am glad that I am not the only one who notices it.I hope that others do, too.  </p>

		<p>Race relations have not gotten better according to blacks? Well all I heard after Obama was elected was gloating from black people. Heard some threats too. This election has really opened my eyes to black people and has changed the way I feel about them. And that is they will always hate me.</p>

		<p>Did having a Black man elected Mayor of New York City (David Dinkins) bring about a golden age of peace, prosperity and good race relations in New York City?</p>
<p>How about having Black mayors in D.C. Marion Barry, Detroit - Coleman Young, LA had Black mayor Tom Bradley for 20 years 70s through early 90s (Black riot ended his term of office).</p>
<p>Lower class Blacks are like little children who throw temper tantrums if they don&rsquo;t get what they want. When their bad behavior results in them being given what they want they are only quiet for a very short time, more tantrums will follow.</p>

		<p>When blacks say &#8220;race relations,&#8221; I think they&rsquo;re talking about miscegenation. They want it. Whites by and large don&rsquo;t. And that gulf will never be breached.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-Americans really like President Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office, a new national poll found.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just angry because they thought Obama was the leader of the American branch of ZANU-PF, and they didn&rsquo;t get their free acreage. </p>

		<p>Everyone living in all White countries (especially the ones with substantial racial &#8220;diversity&#8221; for a while now) know that race relationships have never been &#8220;good&#8221; and its naive to think they will get &#8220;better&#8221;. History has shown us that no multiracial nation has survived. But I guess since now we live in the &#8220;21st century&#8221; things should all of a sudden be different? </p>

		<p>To Peejay in Frisco, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of the whites who think that Obama is doing an excellent job, and I am not alone among whites. But what did blacks expect,instant utopia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you mean that you feel General Secretary BO is hastening the &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; collapse of this country, much like his predecessors Bush and Clinton, then you are right, he is doing an &ldquo;excellent job.&rdquo; The assumed &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; of multiculturalism and all of its inequities lurches forward inexorably, much like the zombies in &ldquo;Night of the Living Dead,&rdquo; or some other such ghoulish film.</p>

<p>Nightmarish to be sure; but of course, that is how most &ldquo;utopias&rdquo; end up anyway!<br/>
