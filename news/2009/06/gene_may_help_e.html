<h1>Gene May Help Explain Kidney Failure in African-Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Landau, CNN, June 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A single gene, called MYH9, may be responsible for many cases of kidney disease among African-Americans, researchers say.</p>
<p>Although doctors have blamed hypertension for causing common forms of kidney disease in African-Americans, new research shows that high blood pressure may not be the chief cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MYH9 gene association in African-American kidney disease is the most powerful genetic cause of a common disease yet discovered,&#8221; said Dr. Barry Freedman, professor of internal medicine and nephrology at Wake Forest University, who led a team of researchers in isolating the gene.</p>
<p>About 70 percent of African-Americans with non-diabetic forms kidney disease have the MYH9 gene, and many of them end up on dialysis, he said. The gene predisposes African-Americans to the kidney disease that was thought to stem from high blood pressure. It also gives them a higher risk of kidney disease associated with HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kidney disease is a serious health issue among African-Americans, who have a fourfold higher risk of developing all common forms of it than whites in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, the gene has not been shown to be the sole cause of kidney damage, Becker said. Diabetes and hypertension remain the most common causes of chronic kidney disease in the United States, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Freedman conducted the research along with colleagues at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes Study.</p>
<p>The team discovered that the gene accounts for nearly half of kidney failure among African-Americans, including diabetic-related and non-diabetic-related kidney disease.</p>
<p>Researchers are now exploring what kinds of environmental triggers might cause the gene to promote kidney failure. HIV seems to trigger the gene and cause kidney failure, he said.</p>
<p>Many kidney doctors had theorized that African-Americans developed kidney disease more often than whites because they might not get to see their doctors as often, had more severe high blood pressure and faced other environmental stressors, Freedman said. But research shows that the risk variant of the MYH9 gene is more prevalent in among African-American populations than white populations and seems to explain much of the excess risk for non-diabetic kidney disease in African-Americans, he said.</p>

<p>Just imagine what kind of disappointment this report is drawing from the self-hating whites and ALL the black groups.  They just love to blame whitey, even for hiccups.</p>
<p>I guess the only thing left to do is to attack the study and call it racist.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that living among whites makes blacks nervous and that stress takes a small daily psychological and physiological toll. </p>
<p>Blacks are a minority in a sea of whites and browns. To make a living, blacks have to deal with whites and browns every day. You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s stressful? </p>
<p>Maybe some readers have never been to a space where blacks or brown dominate. I suggest they go to their local inner city and try it out to find out how it feels, and imagine having to do that every day. </p>

<p>Siffering cultures can certainly add some stress.  However, according to the FBI and DoJ, blacks commit crimes against whites more often than whites commit crimes against blacks.  Therefore, it makes perfect sense that whites around blacks should be more nervoue than blacks around whites.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure there is some stress associated with that, but let&rsquo;s compare. For blacks living among whites (I&rsquo;m leaving browns out for the time being), the stress comes from whites perhaps not looking them in the eye, avoiding them and a sense of tacit disapproval; that maybe things are being said behind their backs. Not a walk in the park to be sure, and I have sympathy for decent blacks who feel this way. </p>
<p>Whites living among blacks, however, deal with constant hard stares of outright hatred, spitting on the sidewalk as they pass, openly voiced racial epithets and the very real possibility of being killed or beaten to a pulp for looking the wrong person in the eye or, God forbid, responding to one of the constant insults openly directed at them. What&rsquo;s worse? </p>
<p>As for the browns, well, the area I live in is mostly Hispanic, maybe 10% black. Guess who causes all the trouble? I do get the sense that the Hispanics aren&rsquo;t crazy about gringos, but they keep it to themselves and when I do deal with them they&rsquo;re generally polite. It&rsquo;s probably somewhat similar to the experience of blacks in an all white area. I suppose it&rsquo;s somewhat stressful, but I&rsquo;m a big boy. I&rsquo;ll take it over the open hostility of blacks any day. </p>
