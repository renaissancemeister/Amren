<h1>Chicken Wings on the Hoof? Coops Could Be Legal in City Soon</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Meyer, Buffalo News, June 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Raising chickens might soon be legal in Buffalo, with advocates insisting that strict rules would prevent odors, rat problems and other nuisances.</p>
<p>People would have to pay a onetime $25 fee for a license, with the money offsetting the costs of a mandatory inspection of coops, under the legislation sponsored by Niagara Council Member David A. Rivera.</p>
<p>No roosters would be permitted, and no more than five hens would be allowed per dwelling. The fowl could only be kept in rear yards, and coops could be no larger than 32 square feet.</p>
<p>In addition, the coops would have to be at least 20 feet away from any window or door of any property and a minimum of five feet from all side lot lines. Chickens would have to be kept inside the coop within a fenced yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;People won&rsquo;t have to worry about walking into someone&rsquo;s yard and having chickens running all over the place,&#8221; Rivera said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issue surfaced after a West Side woman was forced to move her hens to a site outside Buffalo after learning that city laws do not permit people to raise chickens. Monique Watts launched a campaign to change the law, noting that urban chicken farming is a growing trend nationally.</p>
<p>Watts believes the bill is a good first step, even though some of the conditions are &#8220;very restrictive.&#8221; For example, Watts said some people with small rear yards would be unable to comply with rules that require coops to be certain distances from dwellings and property lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Watts also questioned another rule that would bar people from selling eggs that are laid by backyard chickens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rivera hopes the new regulations will be approved by the end of July. Recognizing that some residents and lawmakers are worried that allowing chicken coops in yards could cause neighborhood tensions, Rivera highlighted nearly two dozen restrictions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other rules would require rat-proof chicken feed containers and would bar people from slaughtering chickens outside.</p>
<p>Before a license is issued, property owners who live within 50 feet of the applicant would be notified and given an opportunity to comment.</p>
<p>If chicken coop owners don&rsquo;t comply with the rules after obtaining licenses, Rivera said, there will be an easy remedy.</p>

Just look at who&rsquo;s sponsoring this legislation: Niagara Council Member David A. <b>Rivera</b>. There&rsquo;s a reason the west side of Buffalo is referred to as the &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; west side.</p>
<p>People have no cultural memory. People fail to remember why these regulations were originally enacted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what restrictions they impose, this will get out of hand and neighbors are going to complain. It&rsquo;s unlikely Mr. Rivera is going to have to live next to a chicken coop but he doesn&rsquo;t have a problem forcing this problem on others who will have no power to fight back.</p>
<p>And remember a few years back the hysteria over the avian flu?</p>
<p>In time, the chicken coops will become covers for cock fighting.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to own chickens, there is plenty of rural space to do so. There&rsquo;s no reason to bring such a problem to urban neighborhoods. </p>
<p>More foolishness.</p>

		<p>This might be a result of certain new arrivals, but the left wing is also big into things like free range chickens that can run around in a back yard.  So this might be a matter of the left wing as it is immigration.</p>

<p>Some of us Christians are into free-range and natural stuff too.  BTW, did you mean &#8220;left wing&#8221; as a pun?  :)</p>
<p>As long as it isn&rsquo;t hurting anyone or causing problems, I personally don&rsquo;t care if someone has a chicken coop.</p>

		<p>My local paper talked about an interest in raising chickens in the city. Their version has white yuppies raising chickens to provide organic food. Hmm&hellip; City people usually have no interest in growing food. If they did, they would not live in the city. Note how the liberal press seems to work together. If we legalize chicken raising  the mexicans have their cockfighting in the city. They won&rsquo;t have to travel so far. </p>

		<p>As sbuffalonative notes, the hispanics will ignore the &#8220;strict rules&#8221; regulating this just as they do our immigration laws.</p>
<p>Years ago I was driving through the Bronx and I saw a Puerto Rican chasing his chickens down the street. They had escaped from his backyard. </p>

		<p>yes, welcome to the third world.  it seems the obama administration has given up on the america we grew up in, prosperous, with rich and vital urban centers.  after all, didn&rsquo;t i read on this site where they&rsquo;re planning to bulldoze the ghettoes of large american cities?  chicken farms in every backyard is next, with disease soon to follow.  this is the future of the USA</p>

		<p>Great idea!</p>
<p>Lets start with chicken, then move on to goats, sheep, pigs and cows. If Hispanic can raise chickens, shouldn&rsquo;t Hindus be allowed to let cows roam free the way they do in Indian cities?</p>
<p>What happens when a Muslim objects to a neighbor raising pigs?</p>
<p>What about the Bird Flue? Wasn&rsquo;t that a scare just a couple of years ago? Now we are wanting to raise chickens in densely urban areas? Is the U.S. Dept of Agriculture going to do any inspection?  </p>
<p>We have Hispanics living 10-15 in 3 bedroom houses with half a dozen or more cars parked in the front yard. Does anyone seriously  think that anyone will enforce the 5 chicken limit? </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.bar people from slaughtering chickens outside.&#8221; What are they suppose to do slaughter them in the house?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.onetime $25 fee for a license&#8221; A lot of these people don&rsquo;t have drivers licenses and someone expects them to get a chicken licenses?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.the coops would have to be at least 20 feet away from any window or door of any property and a minimum of five feet from all side lot lines.&#8221; We are talking about an urban environment with small or no back yards.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.another rule that would bar people from selling eggs that are laid by backyard chickens.&#8221; How do you tell if the eggs being sold at the farmers market were laid in country or the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some city officials were scratching their heads Wednesday as they reviewed the bill. If roosters are banned, then how will hens lay eggs?&#8221; So these city officials don&rsquo;t know the first thing about raising chickens, yet they are going to have to vote on a chicken bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some of these restrictions can be eased a bit,&rdquo; she said.&#8221; Could we at least pass the bill before we start to water it down?</p>

		<p>Folks, you need to catch up with the times. This is not about race, it&rsquo;s about failure of the system and economic self sufficiency. Personal income tax filings were down 25% in America. More and more people are growing their own food. </p>

		<p>Frozen whole chickens go for $4 at the supermarket, so what sense is it to build an entire coop to raise 5(!) hens at a time (or $20 of chicken)?? What happens during the winter months? The whole idea is asinine. </p>
<p>Chickens do make better pets than goldfish, I admit (if that&rsquo;s the intent) and arguably as interesting pets as a cat or a dog. <br>

		<p>HAPPY BACKYARD FARMING - YES!</p>
<p>Left and right and hippie and non-hippie and Anglo and Hispanic backyard coops are not the issue here.</p>
<p>No roosters = minimal noise and NO cockfighting <br>
[and - let us be honest - there is nothing AT ALL wrong about cockfighting, even cockfighting to the death &hellip; but THAT is not the issue here.]</p>
<p>I greatly prefer today&rsquo;s 100% fresh brown organic eggs with beautiful rich golden yolks rather than factory-farmed eggs [and you can check out what PETA and other alleged-extremists have say about the vile horrors of factory-farming of chickens for eggs or meat.]</p>
<p>I might - in passing - add that Muscovy ducks are silent and a joy to rear.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;People won&rsquo;t have to worry about walking into someone&rsquo;s yard and having chickens running all over the place,&rdquo; Rivera said.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
As someone named Rivera ought to know, when it comes to mesoamericans and their beloved &#8220;pollos,&#8221; regardless of what you might TELL these people about the need to keep the birds in their coops, it will be no time at all until chickens are indeed RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. </p>
<p>And also, as other posters have pointed out, being used for cockfighting. </p>
<p>I am opposed on principle to EVERY attempt to impose Third World values/customs/prejudices/superstitions upon First World nations. This is yet another in an endless parade of demands from immigrants from countries that our countries should let them keep doing whatever they used to do in their backwards countries   &mdash;   thereby dragging US backwards too. </p>
<p>Also, please note that the Hispandering trend that began in the SW has now made it as far North and East as Buffalo, NY.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. These people bring with them many of the ideas, habits, and manners that make their native countries Third World in character; the lack of a work ethic, an inclination toward authoritarian and often violent political behavior, and an unfamiliarity and uneasiness with the religious, educational, hygienic, scientific, and moral conventions of our country that most Americans take for granted.</p>

		<p>White people don&rsquo;t want to live with farm animals in suburbia, so white people wrote community guidelines. Now these non-white people from third world countries have invaded the suburbs and brought their feathered and  four-footed friends with them. Naturally white people will just have to get used to it whether they like it or not. Diversity is so enriching.</p>

		<p>It is instructive and agreeable for families to keep their own chickens and eat fresh eggs from birds fed on good stuff. Children love having their own chickens and watching them thrive and lay eggs.</p>
<p>Sadly, some contributors seem to associate the keeping of chickens, goats, ducks [and so on] with poor, illiterate - and probably unhealthy - Third World people. This is silly, we are all only two or three generations from people who kept their own livestock as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Keeping, killing and eating animals is part of human life. Probably most American kids now have never helped rear chickens or seen a chicken killed. To the urban children of today, chicken is a meat substance which is wrapped in cellophane and bought in a supermarket.</p>
<p>hcl mentions $4 supermarket chickens. You might as well eat dog poop; the taste is NOTHING like as good as the flesh of well-reared chickens fed on good stuff.</p>
<p>Anonymous #18 challenges me on cockfighting; I decline to debate the issue at length except to say that it preserves the old gamecock breed and to add that a number of America&rsquo;s founding fathers approved of the sport. Anything good enough enough for Washington and Jefferson is just fine by me!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather live and die as a fighting cock than as a factory-farmed broiler chicken, that&rsquo;s for sure!</p>

		<p>BACK TO THE LAND FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY!</p>
<p>SKIP reminds us of bus &amp; train &amp; boat &amp; truck-bus travel in Cambodia, Laos, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka, rural Thailand, India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>&hellip; group sex without the sex &hellip; [but WITH the livestock &hellip;]</p>
<p>SKIP - that sort of local travel was not really super-comfy at the time but those are all experiences in life one cherishes. [The parental home with armchairs and couches was FAR more comfortable&hellip;]</p>
<p>Here the immediate neighbor keeps pigeons and he and his family eat the half-fledged squabs; the gentle noise they make is FAR more agreeable than - say - factory hooters or jackhammers.</p>
<p>Please move next door on the other side with your chickens and ducks.</p>
