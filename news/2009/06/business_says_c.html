			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Hemann, Baltimore Sun, June 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mid-town venture capital firm announced in an e-mail to the mayor last week that it was moving out of Baltimore because of crime. The mayor expressed doubts that was the true reason, but either way it&rsquo;s an economic loss for the city at a time when people are fearing a series of random attacks from Federal Hill to Bolton Hill.</p>
<p>While city leaders scramble to downplay the incidents and repeat stastics that crime is down, they are moving up to 50 cops, including undercover detectives, to the Inner Harbor and downtown areas.</p>
<p>Mayor Sheila Dixon, talking with me on Friday, noted that a recent reported attack on a youth at the Inner Harbor turned out to be staged as a gang initiation ceremony. The kids are from Federal Hill&rsquo;s Digital Harbor school, and while the scenario shows that this attack wasn&rsquo;t random, it doesn&rsquo;t do much to alleviate concerns that gangs are not downtown.</p>
<p>Here is the e-mail from New Enterprise Associates&rsquo; general counsel, Louis Citron:<blockquote>Dear Mayor Dixon,</p>
<p>My name is Louis Citron and I am the General Counsel at New Enterprise Associates. We are a venture capital firm located at 1119 St. Paul Street and have been located in the mid town/Belvedere hotel area for nearly 30 years. We have approximately 35 employees located at this office. I also live in Roland Park.</p>
<p>We would like you to know that New Enterprise Associates has decided to move its Baltimore city office to Timonium. We calculated that our decision will cost the merchants in this neighborhood at least $200,000 per year in revenue as we are terminating, among others, our cleaning service and security guard, and will no longer be paying for parking spaces in the local garages, and no longer buying our lunches from local restaurants and the Maryland Club.</p>
<p>Our decision was a result of the high level of crime in our neighborhood. Over the last several years, many of our cars have been broken into resulting in very expensive repairs, our employees have been robbed at gun point, drug needles and used condoms have been left on our front stoop, and psychotic homeless people have menaced our employees and threatened to kill them. We have voiced our frustrations to the local community leaders and police, but the environment has only worsened. The recent local beatings by roving teenagers during the day in this neighborhood, the raucous club in the basement of the Belvedere, and other gang violence throughout the city reinforces the appropriateness of New Enterprise Associates&rsquo; decision to move in order to protect its employees.</p>

		<p>This happened in the surrounding areas of Los Angeles&rsquo;s inner city a long time ago. Theft, robbery, murder,etc. What sane business person wants to be subjected to this? What sane customer wants to go to such a place? Later, Koreans and other mainly Orientals opened liquor stores and have had a modicum of success operating them. I suppose it all depends on a persons values and philosphy, whether or not they want to operate a business in these areas. </p>

		<p>You can &#8220;voice all your frustrations to the community leaders&#8221; you want; the black incompetents, crooks and hustlers that are Baltimore&rsquo;s &#8220;community leaders&#8221; aren&rsquo;t about to lift a finger to stop black crime, esp. if it victimizes whites.</p>

		<p>One breif glance at the racial makeup of Baltimore from the link provided tells the whole story.Baltimore is somewhere between Chicago and Detroit in the percentage of blacks.It is surprising that any whites at all stay there.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Over the past month, a series of reports have made people uneasy about the level of safety in Downtown Baltimore.  In truth, statistics show that both violent crime and property crime have decreased Downtown by 40% over the last nine years and that Downtown is still one of the safest areas in Baltimore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then God help the rest of Baltimore if downtown is the safest.  Trying to paint a positve picture of one that is out of control is not going to work.  The company&rsquo;s letter outlining the crime and harassment they and their employees receive are not figments of the imagination, and it should be apparent to this lying spinner that a company has to be desperate indeed to move it&rsquo;s entire operation out of an area, and that it is highly unlikely they are doing it not because they erroneously perceive that there&rsquo;s too much crime and intimidation there, but because that&rsquo;s the reality.  </p>
<p>&#8220;However, positive statistics can be no match for the power of perception.  As a result, we would like to inform the metropolitan community about the steps that are being taken in response to recent events.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Statistics do not lie, but liars use statistics.&#8221;  And what else can the Vistor&rsquo;s Bureau&#8221; do than to cook their stats to try to &#8220;prove&#8221; that what people experience is hardly no crime at all and that they only &#8220;perceive&#8221; to be victims, because of some failing on their part.</p>
<p>Lying repeatedly isn&rsquo;t going to keep people in areas where they&rsquo;re victimized by black and mestizo teen groups that the corrupt politicians just love to call &#8220;gangs,&#8221; because it marginalizes just a few non-whites into a criminal category and hopefully hides the fact that these criminals are just regular, run-of-the-mill non-whites who live throughout the area.</p>
<p>Baltimore is not the only city that is imploding.  Camden, Detroit, Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, etc.  In fact, every large urban area in the country where blacks and mestizos consist of a large part of the population is having EXACTLY the same problems.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t put lipstick on their multicultural pig and make it look any better, nor can they lie to our faces and tell us it&rsquo;s our imagination because it really isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion that the US is dead in its present form.  Just like the recession that the elites tried to get us to believe for over a year wasn&rsquo;t really a recession before they were forced to admit it, they will likewise do exactly the same with the American implosion now in process and their admission to it&rsquo;s authenticity will only come about when the non-white hordes bash in their doors in order to ransack their homes and carry off anything they want.</p>
<p>The worst thing about the left is that they&rsquo;re all pathological liars.</p>

		<p>As always,the mayor is in denial about black crime,and dares not mention it.It&rsquo;s the same in all U.S.cities,and will turn the whole nation into a burned out rendition of Soweto.And that is just what the global elite have engineered,although most American &#8220;sheeple&#8221; do not have a clue!,a third world banana republic is what awaits our grand children,and they most probably will be hunted down in the streets simply for being White.Think it can&rsquo;t happen?,it already is,in South Africa,as Whites handed political power over to blacks,and are being exterminated.Who sits in the White house today?,and is making most of the administration and supreme court top heavy with non whites,as more non-whites stream into the country each day,and anti-white sentiment is ratcheted up,no one should be surprised to see the end of welfare payments and other entitlement programs,when that happens,look for Whites to pay the ultimate price.</p>

		<p>   Yes. Baltimore is a very dangerous, dirty, and frightening place. I don&rsquo;t think Mayor Dixon can do much about anything  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s fairly lackluster and lame, and in trouble for stealing gift cards meant for needy citizens&hellip; <br>
   At the same time, seventeen year old twins were charged today with setting a dog on fire (a Baltimore City policeman rescued the dog, but it had to be put down). <br>
   A lot of Baltimore &#8220;youth&#8221; are in gangs  &mdash;  and, folks, a lot of Baltimore County kids to the west and southwest of the city are in gangs, too. </p>

		<p>I am unsurprised that the mayor who doubts the veracity of the reason for leaving is black. I am unsurprised that the demographics of the area is 66% or so black. I am unsurprised that the majority of immigrant population is black. I am unsurprised that the business has decided to leave. I am happy that I live in an all white neighborhood east of Houston where te only crime of the last 5 years was staged by a black interloper&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is exactly what the City Political Machine wants to happen.  When the jobs leave so will the whites and this will insure a pure Blue City of 100 percent Democrats.  The Blacks do not have to work because the Federal, City and State governments will provide these BLACKS with welfare and other free stuff.  They only need breath and vote Democrat several times a year.  </p>

		<p>Yea, good luck getting the community leaders to do anything meaningful. It&rsquo;s not unlike South Africa&rsquo;s current mess, and it will certainly get far worse. An additional crime (a very big one at that) is the silence of the media regarding race-related crime. There are real victims here, and these so-called community leaders and their media finger puppets must be both remembered and held accountable. I fear where we are headed- few can fathom, save the Afrikaners who know all too well. </p>
<p>Perhaps the only thing worse than Civil War would be appeasement. </p>

		<p>Recall that year we learned that Detroit could not find a national grocery store chain that would agree to operate in Detroit because of the crime and the poor-quality of patrons and employees. Likewise, recall that a major, Black-run hospital in Los Angeles, King-Harbor (named for MLK), was closed because of the incompetency of Black administrators after several people died and the hospital was deep in debt. Teachers flee when Blacks arrive. Recently, we&rsquo;ve learned that Birminigham&rsquo;s sewer system is deep in debt and the county owes $3.8 billion, which it has defaulted on. Birmingham is ~75% Black. Now, we learn that crime is so bad in Baltimore, businesses are forced to close down. There is no escaping the truth or the facts. When Blacks reach critical mass, and Whites can no longer mask the effects of their presence, conditions quickly deteriorate back to the level of Africa. The commerce model does not work in Africa, and it does not work in America when Blacks reach critical mass. Those are facts.</p>

		<p>Wonder what the mayor said to him in their conversation the day before? The reporter, Peter Hemann, seems afraid to comment. He prints the letter, and beneath it a longer declaration from the mayors office about how crime is going down. The paper must have tasked him with writting a story about it.</p>

		<p>I was recently in Baltimore. It is very bizarre place. At once it appears there is hardly anyone even in the city, as the streets and sidewalks seem virtually empty(compared to many other eastern cities especially) - then one begins to see homelss types laying about, Blacks wandering aimlessly about and a few White business people going about their day. It was almost a surreal scene. It definitely gave the appearance of a city where people were afraid to come out from behind closed doors.</p>

		<p>After Britain banned guns, the incidence of knife crime soared.  Assaults, murders and the like&hellip;I imagine their murder rate remains the same or has increased.  (Should anyone in Britain be reading this, what do you also know about the British murder rate?)</p>
<p>I just read in World Net Daily an article entitled &#8220;Obama move would eliminate 8 of 10 pocketknifes&#8221;.  Sub-title: &#8220;If this were to pass and you cross the state line with one, it&rsquo;s a felony&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am posting this notice here as it sort of fits.  I know there is talk in Britain of banning knifes.  This after the banning of guns.  </p>
<p>As I understand it, if your pocket knife has a spring in it   &mdash;   even to merely lock the blade in place&hellip;open or closed&hellip;it will be illegal under Obama.</p>
<p>With Obama, eventually everything will be illegal.</p>

		<p>Not surprising. Many years ago, I worked in Philly for a large printing company which moved out of the area for the same reason. Costing Philly something like 90 jobs, if I remember right. Crime, by Blacks, is an inseparable part of their psychological make-up. And explains why Britain picked up seats by the BNP party.</p>
<p>The craziness is we are all AWARE of the propensity of Blacks to gravitate to crime, violence and destructive behavior for its own sake&hellip; we&rsquo;re just not supposed to admit it in public. Go figure!</p>

		<p>Snake Blitzken needs to make a sequal called,&#8221; Escape from Baltimore.&#8221; It`s race epandering congressman Elijah Cummings has filed a &#8221; Don`t snitch witness protection bill.&#8221; Blacks are so terrified of each other that nobody sees anything at Oriole games.<br>
     One coureagous black man started a campaign to run the crack dealers out of his neighborhood. He begged for the right to keep a shot gun in his walk up apartment house. The Cops refused to let him and his sons be armed. Black crack dealers burned up his building with him and seven other members of this family in it. After the blaze the cops kept a squad car to protect his family`s ashes.<br>
     We should send all the Gitmo terrorists to Baltimore but that might be worse than Guantanamo. Black govenors can rule whites and Asians but not their own people. Fransis Scott Key must be really proud.<br>

		<p>What most liberal whites don&rsquo;t understand is that with a black president the likelihood of black street crime and violence INCREASES, not decreases.</p>
<p>Blacks feel empowered and emboldened - but not to stay in school or go to college or to work hard - but instead to go rob/rape/pillage without fear of government retribution.</p>
<p>This is the cold hard reality of the black worldview, colored by their open racism towards whites, cultivated by anti-white propaganda and PC in our media, and driven by their genetic tendencies towards violence and poorly constructed decisionmaking.</p>

		<p>The letter from Mr. Citron to the Mayor sounded long over-due. </p>
<p>How can anyone run a Business in those conditions? How could they attract Customers to that Business, and retain qualified Employees, if there lives are in peril? </p>
<p>The City of Baltimore, like every other Major American City, is cutting its own throat by bowing to the Multiculturalist, and Diversity crowds. </p>
<p>Every day, another Business Owner gets fed up enough to pack it in, and move his Company to another location that takes Crime seriously. But, those locations are getting fewer and fewer.</p>
<p>Eventually, these large Cities will implode under their own Socialist-Welfare weight, and in turn, they will take the rest of the country with them. </p>
<p>The only real chance for Whites is to hold on to their Suburban Communities, as well as those rural areas that can sustain our people through Farming, and the Trades.</p>
<p>With the Country spinning further out of control, Whites have purchased more guns, since November, 2008 then in any time in memory, and even surpassed the months after September 11, 2001. </p>

		<p>The mayor and police chief repeatedly point out that crime reports in the area are actually down. This paradox is easily answered. Most people are street smart enough to avoid the street and become a victim. How many people can become a crime statistic in a city if everyone avoids the streets because they rightly fear to do so?</p>

White entrepreneurs bought up row houses, put in new<br>
floors, new walls, new appliances, new roofs..but the<br>
one thing they couldnt change was Baltimore itself. They<br>
drove back the blight, the laziness, the entire black <br>
mentality..but they drove it back only a few blocks. Back<br>
came the nightly forays of blacks looking for white women to hit on, white men walking alone, cars left open, doors unlocked.  Gullible yuppies that bought these places are paying for their ignorance and idealism, and thats one bright spot in the whole depressing fiasco.</p>

The posts here are thoughtful and full of good information and leads and links to other good information on these issues.</p>
<p>However, the posters messages get, for me, completely unreadable if they are posted as one big single spaced paragraph.</p>
<p>The format of the boxes for reading the postings add to it by having no margin on the right, &amp; a font tightly single spaced. </p>
<p>Special thanks to all those commenters who write complex interesting sentences, and double space after each one.  </p>

		<p>Chocolate cities like Baltimore want their cake and to eat it, too. They would love to have another White company move in, pay taxes, spend money, etc. When I lived in Oakland, CA, the black city government tried to lure White businesses back downtown. Most wouldn&rsquo;t bite because they saw too many marauding blacks wandering aimlessly or sprawled out on the sidewalks. The city tried to play on White guilt by saying that businesses were selfish and lacked idealism. Idealism apparently means placing your head against a buzzsaw. I believe that what black governments need is not just White money but an aura of legitimacy and competence they haven&rsquo;t earned. </p>

		<p>It is often said that poverty causes crime, but the reverse is more likely to be true - CRIME CAUSES POVERTY. Businesses simply cannot operate in this type of hostile and threatening environment. So much money has to be spent on security as to make business unprofitable and business transactions cannot be done in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. This is the real reason why black neighbourhoods are so bereft of decent businesses - the black propensity towards crime. </p>

		<p>Anonymous #21 - The original yuppies of Federal Hill did very nicely.  Some in the 1970s bought the properties for $1 under the idea of &#8220;urban homesteads.&#8221;   (The real homesteads on the praire had to deal with, shall we say, difficulties in the neighborhood from parties mentioned in The Declaration of Independence.)  The yuppies rehabilitated them, and most sold out in the 1990s for outstanding profits.</p>

<p>Why bother with breathing? Next to live blacks, dead people of any race are the Democrats&rsquo; most loyal voting bloc. And they don&rsquo;t demand welfare, do-nothing &#8220;jobs&#8221; or any other payoff in exchange for their votes!</p>
<p>For the record, the black part of Dallas (south of I-30) is a miniature Baltimore. About the only businesses remaining are liquor stores and pawnshops; everything else either closed up or moved out. Back in the 1990s the city council had to pay all sorts of bribes to keep the Jan. 1 Cotton Bowl game from abandoning its namesake stadium.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eventually, these large Cities will implode under their own Socialist-Welfare weight, and in turn, they will take the rest of the country with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just read that 1 in 9 of Americans are on food stamps.  Of course if the country were not overrun with cheap labor minority immigrants, more Americans would have jobs and not need food stamps.</p>

<p>I stopped at a fast food joint on the edge of the black part of Dallas, it had bullet proof glass. Sad.</p>

		<p>Not much to add here. I live in a mostly (90-95%) white area of the PNW and my quality of life is much higher presently simply due to the fact that I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the same brainless black hostility against whitey that I did when I lived in multicultural paradise.</p>
<p>What is interesting to note is how often blacks are responsible for chaos even when so very few of them are around. I lived in an apartment complex for about a year in NW Washington state where almost no blacks lived. There were two incidents of, shall we say, &#8220;trouble&#8221; in the time that I lived there. Guess who the perps were? A couple of lesser incidents were perpetrated by Mexicans, though generally they made far better neighbors than blacks did. Its amazing how black people are consistently the kiss of death to the well-being of any community. </p>
