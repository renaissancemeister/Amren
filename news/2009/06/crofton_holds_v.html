			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Beisel, The Capital (Annapolis), June 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 500 people gathered last night in Crofton to pay tribute to a 14-year-old boy killed there on Saturday after he was attacked as he rode his bike.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of the memorial service, Adkins recounted how she tried on Saturday to warn her son about the group of teens who soon after would beat him, causing him to fall from his bicycle, strike his head and die on the street.</p>
<p>She said she thought perhaps the group of boys she saw were the same ones that prompted her to transfer Christopher out of Arundel High School to South River after a trip to a shopping mall with a group of elementary school friends turned into a clash between two groups of teens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said she walked past a group of a half-dozen teens at the community pool down the street from her home and sent a text message to warn Christopher on Saturday. He responded &#8220;I&rsquo;m fine,&#8221; Adkins told the The Washington Post, choking back tears yesterday as she scrolled through her son&rsquo;s last messages on her cell phone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police were originally called to the neighborhood for a report of a boy who&rsquo;d been hit by a car. When they arrived, they found the boy had been attacked by other teens while riding his bike.</p>
<p>Christopher was taken to Baltimore Washington Medical Center by ambulance, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed he died of head and neck injuries.</p>
<p><b>No bond</b></p>
<p>Javel Marqueth George, 16, was charged as an adult and a 14-year-old boy was charged as a juvenile with manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment.</p>
<p>Police said both suspects were questioned by detectives and admitted to punching Christopher, who fell off his bike and struck his head on the ground as he tried to flee.</p>
<p>George is being held at the Jennifer Road Detention Center without bond. The 14-year-old boy is at the Cheltenham Juvenile Detention Center. Both will remain in custody until their trial.</p>
<p>In the bail review hearing yesterday in District Court in Annapolis, George&rsquo;s father testified that his son was a good student dealing with a bad situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Michelle Smith asked Judge Thomas L. Pryal to hold George without any bond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Earlier dispute</b></p>
<p>Christopher had been a student at Arundel High until early May, when he transferred to South River, Mosier said. He said George is a freshman at Arundel.</p>
<p>Capt. David Waltemeyer, commander of the county Police Department&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation Division, said the assault stemmed from an earlier dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the two suspects have had a beef with the victim and some of the victim&rsquo;s friends the last couple of weeks or 30 days,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The suspects happened to see Christopher while they were walking in the area, Waltemeyer said. They exchanged words and then the teens assaulted Christopher and ran away.</p>
<p>Police said they are still trying to piece together what the dispute was about.</p>
<p>Rumors have spread through the neighborhood that the incident was gang-related. Waltemeyer said there are two loosely organized groups in the area.</p>
<p>But they are not organized gangs with leadership structures. They&rsquo;re more like &#8220;neighborhood crews&#8221; of kids that live in the same area or go to the same school, he said.</p>
<p>The groups, The New Threat and East Side Diamonds, have less than 12 teenage members in each and aren&rsquo;t like known gangs such as the Bloods or the Crips, Waltemeyer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Waltemeyer said though the victim was white and the suspects are black, there is no indication that the incident was racially motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with race,&#8221; he said.</p>

**********************************<br>
Oh, of COURSE not. Just a white child trying to ride his bike, set upon by a gang of black thugs for doing what generations of children have been able to do, unmolested, but now cannot do for fear of their very lives. It&rsquo;s no wonder there is an &#8220;epidemic of obesity&#8221; when parents don&rsquo;t dare let their children go outside to play in the fresh air, They are somewhat safer inside playing video games. At least they are in less danger of being murdered in cold blood for being white.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what most black gangs are.  You think the Bloods, Crips, and Gangsters Disciples have National Headquarters and print out membership cards and collect periodical membership dues? </p>

<p>There is &#8220;no indication that the incident was racially motivated&#8221; because the authorities aren&rsquo;t looking for evidence that it was, because the victim was white and the suspects are black.  If the races were reversed, the authorities would look 24/7/365 for a zillion years to find the slightest shred of evidence that it was, and any little thing they could find would be used by the State&rsquo;s Attorney to add hate crimes riders. </p>

<p>If this was a black on white crime, the HEADLINE would have read &#8220;Group of white teenagers charged in vicious killing of innocent black teenager&#8221;&hellip;along with photos of the black on his prom night and hysterical relatives sobbing.</p>
<p>And everyone would have been screaming about &#8220;HATE, HATE, HATE!&#8221; and &#8220;RACISM, RACISM, RACISM!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is maddening.  But every time a black-on-white &#8220;racial&#8221; incident occurs, the media and law enforcement fall all over themselves to proactively tell us &#8220;it is not racial&#8221;.  </p>
<p>There are alot of other possible things that this crime &#8220;is not&#8221;&hellip;such as revenge, or financial, but I do not hear anyone proactively discounting any of these other possiblities.  </p>

<p>It never does, does it? Of the 3,000 whites murdered annually by blacks, not one is ever racially motivated, is it? </p>
<p>If it has nothing to do with race, why are there no blacks in the group photo of the vigil for the victim? They look all white to me. </p>
<p>I guess the only congregation of people that has no diversity requirement is vigils for white murder victims.</p>

		<p>I would say that 99.9% of all black-on-white crime is racially motivated. </p>
<p>Most blacks, especially criminals, are so ridiculously ethnocentric that there is almost no chance of there NOT being a racial motive behind their attacks on whites.</p>

<p>Sure it doesnt. It never does. Its just a coincidence that AS USUAL, the perps are black and the victim is white. </p>
<p> Im on record here countless times opposing hatecrimes laws. But if whites are going to be charged with a hate crime for what they are thinking or for looking at a black sideways, then blacks should be charged as well. Especially considering the far more violent incidents where they attack whites for the sin of being white. <br>

		<p>I think one thing the election of Obama has done is point out the glaring racial double-standards to people who hadn&rsquo;t thought of them before. This is a prime example that AmReners are well aware of but most of the rest of the country doesn&rsquo;t think too much about: whenever there is a white-on-black killing it is assumed (by the media) race is a factor. Whenever it is black-on-white, it is assumed that race ISN&rsquo;T a factor. Why the inconsistency? I&rsquo;ve never gotten a satisfactory answer and I doubt anyone on this board has either. That is something that white people won&rsquo;t stand for when they elected a half-black man into the highest office in the country. </p>

		<p>Practically every Black on White crime is motivated by some sort of animosity of Blacks toward Whites.  We all know what would have happened had this been an alleged White on Black crime.  The media would be on the side of the Black(&rsquo;s)crucifying the Whites as in the Duke &#8220;rape&#8221; case.  Jesse Jackson and his buddy Al Sharpton would make their usual pilgrimage in support of tolerance and diversity, and every Black would be crying racism.  We all know this already.</p>

<p>Obviously this Waltemeyer is just one more career dreg who thinks if he doesn&rsquo;t lie whites will take reciprocal action&hellip;.which they should&hellip;.and his career will suffer by having a riotous situation on his hands.</p>
<p>Now, this is where white leaders and non-white leaders differ.  Non-white leaders will always come down on the side of their own, and to hell with careers, especially if it&rsquo;s a situation like this where it was a race-hate attack, but white career demagogues in law enforcement or the judicial system will not.  </p>
<p>With non-whites, race is their number one priority; with whites, career is their upper most concern.</p>
<p>To prove that all that is necessary is to go to the Amren archives and read the literally dozens of stories where blacks have unreservedly mouthed racial slurs as they were mobbing and beating whites, yet the white demagogues refused to call the incident a racially motivated hate crime.</p>

		<p>Actually, the reverse did happen in another AA County town a couple years back.  Three black kids crashed a a party of white kids and one of them brought a gun. Well, the white boys got a jump on them as they were causing problems and the black kid with the gun fell, hit his head and died. All the front pages screamed RACISM!!! The NAACP came to town and everyone demanded that they string up the white boys. Fortunately, the county prosecuter, try as he might, couldn&rsquo;t bring them up on manslaughter (he&rsquo;s got my vote).  He knew that no AA County jury would indict them because of the presence of the gun. Also, the white boys refused to rat each other out. It was amazing, though, the teenage white girls and their mothers saying it was racism because the black boy had a white girlfriend.</p>

		<p>Early in the article the author attempts to establish that the perpetrators are not responsible for the Cristopher Adkin&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the group of teens who soon after would beat him, causing him to fall from his bicycle, strike his head and die on the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words he was not beaten to death, somehow the street is responsible for killing Cristopher Adkins by virtue of not being softer. Then later:</p>
<p>&#8220;Police were originally called to the neighborhood for a report of a boy who&rsquo;d been hit by a car. When they arrived, they found the boy had been attacked by other teens while riding his bike.</p>
<p>Christopher was taken to Baltimore Washington Medical Center by ambulance, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed he died of head and neck injuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whoever initially called the police about the incident lied to the police by saying the death occurred due to a car accident. How then does the author know Cristopher was killed due to striking his head on the ground? Kids fall off of bikes all the time and while dying is possible, it is a freak accident. A much more likely scenario is that once on the ground Cristopher&rsquo;s assailants set upon him like a pack of hyenas and began kicking his head like a soccer ball. It is quite easy for someone to be killed from such a beating and makes much more sense, but then we couldn&rsquo;t try and pretend this was all some fluke accident. Rather than manslaughter, they would be looking at second degree murder.</p>

		<p>If you were to ask virtually any (non-Black) American: &#8220;How would the news media have covered this story if it had been a Black kid killed by Whites?&#8221;. Invariably, he or she would answer essentially: &#8220;the media would have been all over this story and would have portrayed the crime as racially motivated&#8221;. I find it sickening that this double standard continues year after year. When will White America stand up COLLECTIVELY and end this obscene, racist system? One big problem for White people&rsquo;s is that any effort by Whites to band together to defend their interests is immediately branded as RACIST by the establishment, while racial minorities are able to form race-based associations of every conceivable kind with impunity. Whites must overcome this fear of being labeled as racists and band together for justice if our society is to move forward.</p>

<p>the way i see it : unless white start to fight back literally, tough und violent black will continue to view you as easy target that will not hit back.<br>
black will not respect you because you can write long convincing argument at some website, they&rsquo;ll respect you if you have the power to inflict bodily harm to them.</p>

		<p>One of my work colleagues owned a house a block away.  Crofton, due to its proximity to Route 50 and Prince Georges County, and its many town homes, tends to have a high proportion of Section 8 housing.  Normally, the ghetto garbage that killed the white boy would have remain stuck in some PG County hole like Temple Hills, Suitland, Silver Hills or Seat Pleasant.  Instead, Section 8 housing has unleashed these barbarians on Crofton.  Within ten years, Crofton will be a ruined neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Criminality is ingrained in &#8220;black&#8221; culture.<br>
When I was growing up (during the 1960&rsquo;s &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era), one had to be wary of the blacks, (two riding one bike  &mdash;  one on the handlebars and one pedaling).  Such a scenario was common  &mdash;  when these animals saw a white kid riding his bike, the &#8220;handlebar rider&#8221; would jump off, knock the white kid off his bike and take it.  Although we knew where the perpetrators lived, going there had no effect.  The PARENT(S) would deny that their animals stole the bike WITH THE BIKE SITTING RIGHT THERE. Quite often the white adult would be &#8220;dared&#8221; to take the bike back.<br>
This was a hard (but valuable) lesson learned for a white kid growing up in the 1960&rsquo;s.<br>
Today, black on white violence is common, much more pervasive and is generally ignored by those in &#8220;respectable&#8221; society. &#8220;Respectable (read that &#8220;liberal&#8221;) types have no problem attempting to force &#8220;integration&#8221; on whites but do not do so for themselves.  Quite often, excuses are given for the black criminal.<br>
If one could go back with what one knows today &hellip;</p>

<p>A lot of folks have ripped the paper for printing this particular piece of idiocy, and rightfully so. However, I&rsquo;ll give the Capital this much: they did at least acknowledge the race of the killers and of their victim. The Washington Post&rsquo;s story on this incident went for two full pages (printed from their website) without the words &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;white&#8221; ever being used.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t?  Ok, by that same reasoning, if the family of the murdered boy somehow got a hold of the trash responsible and beat the life out of them, that would be acceptable, right? No, somehow I doubt it.</p>
<p>Also, to address the &#8216;asian guy&rsquo;.  Individually fighting some thug on the street for some sort of street cred is not the answer.  In some ways, those with the least to lose can be the most dangerous.  Why?  Because many of us have jobs and livelyhoods.  Once in the court of law, even the alligation that you are a &#8216;racist&rsquo; for fighting a non-white can have a negative impact on your career.  Not to mention the bad press, legal fees, law suits and God help you if you are convicted.  The worst thing that can happen to the perp that attacked you is what&hellip;three hots and a cot on your dime.</p>
<p>No, the only way we&rsquo;ll achieve anything close to success is to elect leaders with our interest in mind or one of the several ideas that have been presented on this site.  I do not know the best answer but before we can even start thinking about it, Whites will have to come together.  That would mean collectively, we would realize that there is a problem and that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. I think it will get a lot worse first.  Hopefully, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss.  Only the thinkers are fearful of what may come.</p>

		<p>We heard of this awful incident within an hour of it happening.  My girlfriend and I have a friend who was 100 yards away.  She couldn&rsquo;t see anything, but knows several of the neighbors.  We know the person who called the police. That person was rightfully afraid to tell the truth, for fear of certain retaliation from the &#8220;young boys&#8221; &hellip; EUIch!!!  The white boy must have fallen and bounced several times on glass bottles,  because that&rsquo;s what caused the bruises above the concusion.  If his neck is broken it is from the kicking the six blacks put on the poor boy.  This has already been testified to by several witneses.  The authour of this story must be making &#8220;honest mistakes&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It is almost comical that the very last sentence of this article drops the bomb. If the races were opposite it would have been the lead.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ll probably say they assaulted him because &#8220;he yelled racial slurs at us&#8221;,which will then make it justifiable.  </p>

		<p>Murderer George is a &#8220;good student&#8221; according to his father. Does his father live with Murderer George and review his report cards? Go to Parent Nights?  Moreover, Murderer George, who is 16, is such a fine scholar that he is in Ninth Grade. Ninth Grade. </p>
<p>In Maryland, the typical ninth grader is 14 years old. What has Murderer George, a &#8220;good student&#8221;, been doing for the past two years, finishing his ninth grade thesis on the letter &#8220;A&#8221;?  We will see Al Sharpton plopping his fat behind into Anne Arundel County before this is over. Murderer George clearly will be shown to be a victim of white racism.</p>
<p> The white dead racist probably tried to run Murderer George down, and he defended himself, thinking of all the humiliations black men sufferered as slaves. Yes, that  sounds good.</p>
