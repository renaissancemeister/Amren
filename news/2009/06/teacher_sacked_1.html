			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teacher has been sacked after parents claimed that their children were forced to pray to Allah during a religious education lesson.</p>
<p>Alison Phillips was accused of giving two pupils detention after they refused to kneel down and &#8216;pray to Allah&rsquo; during the class.</p>
<p>However, an investigation by the school concluded that there was no truth in the allegation.</p>
<p>Parents were outraged after stories emerged that the two boys, aged 11, were allegedly punished for not wanting to take part in a practical demonstration of how Allah is worshipped.</p>
<p>They said children should not be forced to take part in the exercise, which included wearing Muslim headgear, was a breach of their human rights.</p>
<p>But governors at Alsager High School, near Stoke-on-Trent, denied Mrs Phillips made pupils pray or that two boys were put into detention for refusing to do so.</p>
<p>The school suspended the teacher last July after receiving complaints and a lengthy disciplinary process was carried out.</p>
<p>A statement released on behalf of the school by Cheshire East Council said: &#8216;It can be confirmed that following a long and rigorous disciplinary process, a member of staff at Alsager School has been dismissed from her post.</p>
<p>&#8216;The member of staff was suspended in July 2008 following parental complaints and newspaper reports relating to an RE lesson.</p>
<p>&#8216;In reaching this decision, the governing body wish to make very clear that they were completely satisfied that at no point did that member of staff make children pray to Allah or put boys in detention for refusing to do so.</p>
<p>&#8216;The RE lesson in question contains an element of role play which complies with acceptable practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the time of the alleged incident, one parent  &mdash;  Sharon Luinen, said: &#8216;This isn&rsquo;t right, it&rsquo;s taking things too far.</p>
<p>&#8216;Being asked to pray to Allah, who isn&rsquo;t who they worship, is wrong and what got me is that came away thinking they were being disrespectful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another parent, Karen Williams, said: &#8216;I am absolutely furious and I don&rsquo;t find it acceptable.</p>
<p>&#8216;I haven&rsquo;t got a problem with them teaching my child other religions and a small amount of information doesn&rsquo;t do any harm.</p>
<p>&#8216;But not only did they have to pray, the teacher had gone into the class and asked them watch a short film and then said &#8220;we are now going out to pray to Allah&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grandfather of one of the pupils in the class added: &#8216;It&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting, there&rsquo;s no other way of putting it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Parents had claimed that their children were made to bend down on their knees on prayer mats which the teacher had got out of her cupboard.</p>

		<p>I find it interesting that after years and years and decades of official hostility towards Christianity from the American and British public school systems, that they have no problem becoming the next best thing to Mosques and Islamic seminaries.  Islam is now the official religion of the Great American public school system.</p>

<p>If so wht did they not get the kids to dress up as suicide bombers, or slit a few throats, or multilate one of the girls genitals?</p>
<p>When you look at the supine way in which the Establishment bows to Islam whilst maintaining an anti-christian policy it is no surprise that we have terrorism - they are inviting Islamic aggression.</p>
<p>Hell, in many British schools kids are being fed halal food - again against parental wishes, often without even telling them, and in a gross insult to all non-muslims and in defiance of civilised animal welfare rules.</p>
<p>Sick! </p>

		<p>sbuffalonative: That&rsquo;s what I gathered too. Personally, I believe it isn&rsquo;t fair to the teacher. It&rsquo;s not her fault what she teaches and at no point did she make her pupils submit to beliefs not their own. I wouldn&rsquo;t want Christian kids praying against their will to Allah just as I wouldn&rsquo;t want Muslim children praying to God, if they don&rsquo;t believe in Him.</p>

		<p>Change this to showing the kids how to pray the rosary, and you would see this teacher placed in jail.</p>

		<p>As a teacher, I would like to say that it IS the teacher&rsquo;s fault about what she teaches. I have quit districts who insist upon practices with which I do not believe. It is mandatory (on an ethical basis) that all teachers refuse to teach what they believe is morally damaging. There is nothing more important for a teacher to do.</p>
