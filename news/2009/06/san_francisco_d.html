			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Finnegan, Los Angeles Times, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only after the July 2008 attack did Kiefer [Amanda Kiefer, whose purse was stolen and she was run down] learn of the crime&rsquo;s political ramifications. Izaguirre [Alexander Izaguirre, the purse snatcher and driver of the car], police told her, was an illegal immigrant who had pleaded guilty four months earlier to a drug felony for selling cocaine in the seedy Tenderloin area.</p>
<p>He had avoided prison when he was picked for a jobs program run by San Francisco Dist. Atty. Kamala Harris, now a candidate for California&rsquo;s top law enforcement post. In effect, Harris&rsquo; office had been allowing Izaguirre and other illegal immigrants to stay out of prison by training them for jobs they cannot legally hold</p>
<p>The program, Back on Track, is a centerpiece of Harris&rsquo; campaign for state attorney general. Until questioned by The Times about the Izaguirre case, Harris, a Democrat, had never publicly acknowledged that the program included illegal immigrants. In interviews last week, she and her office offered inconsistent explanations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city has a history of shielding some illegal immigrant criminals from deportation. The assault on Kiefer occurred just a month after a triple homicide in San Francisco that put Mayor Gavin Newsom on the spot over the city&rsquo;s repeated release of Edwin Ramos, the illegal immigrant accused of the slayings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harris said she first learned that illegal immigrants were training for jobs in Back on Track when Izaguirre, then 20, was arrested for the Kiefer assault and other crimes on a purse-snatching spree.</p>
<p>Izaguirre had been selected for the program after two arrests within eight months; an alleged purse-snatching preceded his arrest for selling cocaine. Because completion leads to the expunging of a felony conviction, the program has a waiting list of potential entrants. Selections are made solely by the district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It was a mistake, Harris said, to let illegal immigrants into the program, a &#8220;flaw in the design.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Exactly how many illegal immigrants have been included since the program began four years ago is not publicly known.</p>
<p>Harris said that after Izaguirre&rsquo;s arrest she never asked  &mdash;  and has never learned  &mdash;  how many illegal immigrants were in the program. Sharon Woo and Sharon Owsley, the prosecutors who oversee the program, said they too never asked and have never learned the number.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The San Francisco chapter of Goodwill Industries International handles day-to-day oversight of Back on Track participants for the D.A.&rsquo;s office. Carlos Serrano-Quan, a Goodwill supervisor, said it appeared that fewer than a dozen illegal immigrants had been in the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the illegal immigrants were allowed to graduate before finishing an entire 12 months of the program, as normally required, according to the D.A.&rsquo;s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole point of the program,&#8221; Harris said, &#8220;is that these people would be able to obtain and hold down lawful employment, and if they&rsquo;re undocumented, they probably would not be able to do that, so it would go against the very spirit of the program&#8221; to continue admitting them.</p>
<p>Harris, 44, was elected district attorney in 2003 and reelected in 2007. She designed Back on Track to help young adults who are arrested once for selling drugs; the goal is to help them avoid falling into a life of crime. {snip}</p>
<p>Back on Track participants agree to plead guilty to a drug felony and spend a year in the program, a mix of community service, employment and life-skills training, family counseling and English lessons for those who need them. While in the program, they are free to live where they wish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the last four years, 113 admitted drug dealers have graduated from the program, while 99 were yanked for failing to meet the requirements and sentenced under their guilty plea, according to the D.A.&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her campaign for attorney general, Harris calls Back on Track a model for a statewide approach to preventing crime and easing prison overcrowding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The immigration issue, as it relates to the Izaguirre case, obviously is a huge kind of pimple on the face of this program,&#8221; Harris acknowledged. An instant later, she regretted the metaphor, saying, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t mean to trivialize it, nor do I mean to cover it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He [Izaguirre] is being prosecuted, and he will be deported with my full encouragement and support,&#8221; Harris said.</p>

		<p>To make matters worse, pinko mayor Snewsom has chosen as the new police cheif a pinko from Arizona who strongly favors the sanctuary city policy.When the verdict in the civil suit of the Bolognas vs the City of San Francisco comes out, it just might be (and I hope) a record setter in terms of money for a suit of its kind.That will be a big slap in Newsoms face. </p>

		<p>San Francisco has a history of electing District Attorneys who want to do anything but successfully prosecute felons.  She is not the worst we&rsquo;ve had.  The worst was Hallinan, the son, grandson and brother of leading lights in the California communist party.</p>
<p>There is a program run out of the county jail, &#8220;Sheriff&rsquo;s Parole&#8221;, basically a way to provide county salaries for the political operatives who run the Sheriff&rsquo;s re-election campaigns.</p>
<p>Many of the people working for various do gooder non profits such as mentioned above are black panthers, black muslims, radical la raza types as well as common criminals.  They are always getting arrested for robberies, car thefts etc.  They are always defended.  </p>
<p>I remember W. G.,  who worked for &#8220;Sheriff&rsquo;s Parole&#8221;  He committed a rape.  He already had been convicted of 5 rapes and arrested for 14.  The Sheriff&rsquo;s department forced both deputies and civilian employees to contribute to W. G.&rsquo;s bail money.</p>
<p>He was bailed out.  On the first day of his trial the trial recessed at noon to be continued the next morning.  He got in his car, drove downtown, picked up a 14 year old Australian girl in town for her Easter vacation school trip, drove her to the beach and raped her.  He dumped her out.  Fortunately she memorized his license plate number.  He was arrested for that rape that night, pled guilty a couple days later and went to San Quentin.</p>
<p>W. G is a good example of why California voters voted in the 3 strikes law.  Before that, the standard sentence for ist degree murder was about 4 years.  7 year sentence for the murder with time off for good behavior and time served in county jail awaiting trial</p>
<p>The &#8220;executive director&#8221; &#8220;Sheriff&rsquo;s parole&#8221; program served 2 7 year terms in San Quentin for murder.  Assistant district attorneys are not civil service.  They are appointed by the elected district attorney and serve at his or her pleasure.  Most of the assistant district attorneys are National Lawyers Guild (communist front since the 1920&rsquo;s) and members of other radical legal groups.</p>
<p>The last thing the San Francisco district attorney&rsquo;s office wants is normal prosecutors.  The entire department is just a way for radical to get county paychecks and thus support themselves as they pursue their radical agenda.</p>
<p>Most of the money for the do gooder organizations comes from federal and state funds to help law enforcement.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to the huge asian population of San Francisco.  It is not that they support the radical agenda.  They don&rsquo;t support it at all.</p>
<p>But the asians do not vote if they are citizens.  They are only active politically if something directly affects asians.</p>
<p>There are so few normal non radical whites left in San Francisco that there is no one left to counter act the communists and radicals who run the city.</p>
<p>Here are the asian issues which they care about and are active in</p>
<p>(1) Anti school busing.  San Francisco Asians have been pursuing anti school busing law suits since around 1964.  They always lose of course, but they just file another and continue the fight.</p>
<p>(2) Abolition of zoning and building codes.  The asians want the city and county to stop harassing them about their habit of housing 25 people in 1,000 sq foot 2 bedroom houses, using their garages as slaughter houses and food processing factories and putting up partitions and turning their houses and apartment buildings into fire trap warrens of cubicles.</p>
<p>(3) Abolition of employee protections, minimum wage etc or anything that interfers with their slave labor sweatshop operations.</p>
<p>They have been totally successful in forcing the police to ignore their illegal gambling operations which are as big as the gambling operation in Reno Nevada.</p>

		<p>Ms. Harris&rsquo;s mother is from India and her father is from Jamaica so it&rsquo;s not surprising she supports San Fran&rsquo;s status as a sanctuary city.</p>
<p>She fits in w/the ridiculous far-left mayor Gavin Nuisance. </p>

		<p>Blacks are leaving SF, mainly b/c of Hispanic crime and high cost of living.  So their black DA goes out and supports illegal alien criminals.  She wants to be AG of California, watch almost all of CA&rsquo;s blacks vote for her.</p>
