			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arnold Chao, Yahoo! Personals, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent study on racial preferences of online daters provides some interesting findings. Based on profile-searching criteria set by singles using Yahoo! Personals, the UCI case study reveals that gender plays an important role in interracial preferences: &#8220;Asian American men are the least preferred mate for Caucasian women&#8221; Asian American men are the least preferred mate for Caucasian women, and African American women bear the brunt of discrimination from Caucasian men. UCI researchers say that &#8220;the stereotypical images of masculinity and femininity shape dating choices&#8221; and are a contributing factor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For those of you involved with a date  &mdash;  or mate  &mdash;  of a different race, check out these obstacles of interracial dating and ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>Dating Obstacle #1. The Traditionalists</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve encountered several people who possess strong opinions about interracial dating: A South African told me that people should date within their own race; my Korean American friend found it inconceivable to betroth a white woman; some Asian guys I&rsquo;ve met told me they loathe competing with white guys to woo Asian bachelorettes.</p>
<p>Yes, the resistance against interracial dating persists, even in the diverse San Francisco Bay Area where I live. {snip}</p>
<p>How do you cope?</p>
<p>Surround yourself with pals who tolerate diversity. {snip} The acceptance you receive from a circle of friends strips away your sensitivity to snide comments that oppose your open dating preferences.</p>
<p>Dating Obstacle #2. The Stereotypes From Mass Media</p>
<p>Can you blame the TV producers and advertisers for playing it safe by catering to the majority? After all, they measure what appeals to a mass audience and go with what we&rsquo;re familiar with. It&rsquo;s no mystery that stereotyping the population is much easier than representing eclectic subgroups within our population. {snip}</p>
<p>How do you cope?</p>
<p>Recognizing the biased reality of the media business in itself resolves much of the adverse impact of broadcasted stereotypes. Avoid &#8220;keeping up with the Joneses&#8221; and don&rsquo;t think you have to date like all the idealized couples the generic media fodder has fed you. Boil your beliefs down to what really matters to you, and you&rsquo;ll become stereotype-resistant.</p>
<p>Dating Obstacle #3. The Offensive Family Member</p>
<p>It happens: You&rsquo;ll attend a family gathering where your estranged uncle shows that he may not be as culturally enlightened as the rest of your family. The off-color jokes spew out of his mouth. He snickers. You&rsquo;re in shock. Your significant other is in shock. {snip}</p>
<p>How do you cope?</p>
<p>Realize that there may always be a family member, or friend, who has trouble thinking before uttering insensitive opinions or bluntly racist remarks. Prepare for these confrontations. Let that person know if you think his/her comments are offensive, and choose honest yet eloquent ways to respond. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dating Obstacle #4. The Gazers</p>
<p>I know. It gets old. Not everybody is used to seeing an interracial couple. People will stare at you. They may even display a frown or a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>How do you cope?</p>
<p>Ignore the natural response of attempting to read their minds. Who knows what they&rsquo;re thinking when they stare: {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} These public encounters add flavor to the otherwise bland experiences of their lives. You&rsquo;re simply desensitizing them to the notion of colorblind dating. Sooner or later, they won&rsquo;t look twice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they&rsquo;ve seen it before.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect AMREN topic-race is not supposed to matter in this day and age.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed from perusing these ads is that white men are by far the most preferred (at least in the NY area), that is an abundance of white women include WM, an abundance of  Asian Women include WM- in fact I think just as many if not more AW just prefer WM as their own AM, and Afro and Latin Women are more likely to include WM if not make them their sole preference.</p>
<p>White females may not troll for relationships with black males online because it is probably much easier to find that elsewhere if they want it. </p>
<p>I know Steve Sailer is despised by some here but he writes very compellingly about interracial relations:   <a href="https://tinyurl.com/no8ayx" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/no8ayx</a></p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been noticing many more Black Male/Asian Female couplings. Could be a harbinger of things to come?</p>
<p>Finally, while I&rsquo;m typing this I had the idiot box on which was playing the Tyra Banks Show. Watched only a little but I noticed that Tyra will throw in these little race reality things, such as &#8220;Who said that White Girls can&rsquo;t be Strong?&#8221; in regard to a white girl facing down her former Afro paramour. The realities usually puff up blacks and belittle whites. I don&rsquo;t really mind her speaking her mind but I can&rsquo;t imagine a non-melanin enhanced host could do the same.  </p>

<p> It was all I could do to finish this silly story. I&rsquo;d question the &#8220;storyteller&rsquo;s&#8221; preferences, but don&rsquo;t want my post rejected. Just a coincidence that &#8220;white male&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination&#8221; appear in the same sentence? It seems people go far out of their way to bash whites these days. Although, I must confess I am very discriminating. I&rsquo;ll always choose the beautiful blonde-haired, fair-skinned, blue-eyed, feminine lady.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering why they get off on such a silly tangent to begin with and concern themselves with things that are totally unnatural in the natural scheme of things.</p>
<p>They appear to be wringing their hands that not enough intermixing is going on.</p>
<p>Actually, the first thing I thought of when I saw the chart was to wonder which side these people will support when we split apart into racial factions.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe.</p>

		<p> The slant of the story is plain: Interracial dating and marriage is just fine, it&rsquo;s trendy and shows you&rsquo;re progressive and open-minded, and everyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with that   &mdash;   well, make that everyone WHITE who doesn&rsquo;t agree with that   &mdash;   is a hateful, narrow-minded racist. The writer doesn&rsquo;t actually single out White people for criticism, but it&rsquo;s plain that&rsquo;s who he has in mind. That&rsquo;s ALWAYS who they have in mind in such articles as this.</p>
<p> If Arnold Chao were sitting here before me right now, I would like to ask him this question: If miscegenating is so great, if mixed-race marriages are so wonderful, why is it that, ever since there have been two or more races, the overwhelming majority of the members of them have mated with people from their own race? Have we been wrong for about 10,000 years, and all of a sudden in the last 40 years or so people like you have discovered (drum roll, please) THE TRUTH?!</p>

<p>Just thinking&hellip; If this conclusion was drawn from statistics wouldn&rsquo;t it be equally correct to say &ldquo;Caucasian women are the least preferred mate for Asian American men&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t speak too well of Caucasian women if the first conclusion is true given the fact of the superiority of the average Asian male compared to the average Black  male.<br>

<p>What else would you expect from an Asian male living in the West, writing in a Western language, wearing Western clothes, calling himself by a Western first-name, surrounded by Western technology and Western people?</p>
<p>Miscegenation is the ultimate in &#8216;going Western&rsquo;.  Any race that takes white genetics improves its lineage.  The opposite is true for whites.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of an article/study on LiveScience.com a while ago. Basically it said it is primarily the women that reject men based on their race. They did a speed dating study to better understand the racial preferences of men vs. women and not surprisingly men were more likely to date anything if it were attractive, whereas women were more likely to prefer men who&rsquo;s race matched that of their fathers regardless of the other factors.</p>
<p>The one exception was Asian women. They often will accept Asian men or White men. The study came to the conclusion that while Asian females and White male pairings are relatively common, it is predominantly because Asian women are willing to date white men, and not so much that white men prefer Asian women. </p>
<p>Overall the females were typically MUCH more selective when it came to race (yet often it is the women that are blamed for interracial dating, how ironic).</p>

<p>In Europe in the 1700s and 1800s and early 1900s, this &#8220;race factor&#8221; was practically non-existent. </p>
<p>So sad that it is a very major issue all people are forced to deal with today. This is because former generations of Whites refused to deal with this issue and solve it with courage and conviction. Their cowardice has put us all in this position.</p>

		<p>I can never understand why a group of people so aware of race always solely point to Asian women and white male relationships as due to Asian women preferring white men.  Look at how Asian is a distinct and large category of porn. (e.g. Hustler&rsquo;s Asian Fever magazine, etc.)  Look at how there are significant numbers of sex tourists from the West going to Thailand rather than Ukraine, a country that is just as poor.  One of the reasons for so many white men and Asian women is that a significant minority of white men want Asian women.  Since Asians are a small minority in the West, you end up with a high percentage of out marriage because of what some white men prefer.  This seems to me the most obvious explanation.</p>

		<p>Yahoo is pretty much the Internet version of USA Today in promoting the multicult agenda and denigrating whites whenever they can. Try this little experiment for the next week or so. Yahoo always has four small pictures under their captioned stories.  Invariably, at least one (and more often two or three) will have a picture of a black in it.</p>

		<p>I would have ignored this topic several years ago until I read a book entitled Slumming by Chad Heap. It talks about how Whites would venture down into Black and other non-White districts for elicit sex and other wanton behavior.</p>

		<p>So a white man&rsquo;s decision to date white women and not to date black women is discrimination? Why does this not apply to any other mixed coupling in this story? </p>
<p>In the graph provided the claim is there are 286,000 black men married to white women and 117,000 white men married to black women. In my travels throughout the US I have seen literally thousands of black m/white f couples and very, very few white m/black f couples. Probably less than 10. Though Im sure that MOST black m/white f couples are together without benefit of marriage, I find it hard to believe that there are only 286,000 black m/white f married couples. And I find it hard to believe there are 117,000 white m/black f married couples. That last number seems far too high. That would mean there is nearly one white m/black f couple for every 2 black m/white f couple out there. </p>

<p>Huh? Middle Easterners are predominantly Caucasian (like 90%+ in most cases). Plus they do not have the same &#8220;physical shortcomings&#8221; that Asian men are famous for (and yes that does work against Asian men, height wise and otherwise).</p>

<p>I would have to think that&rsquo;s true. At the same time a lot of white men seem to exclude the possibility of dating non-white, and black women especially. Who needs the rejection or the hassle. Even when you win you lose.   </p>

		<p>I also notice the bias in the article. If white men or white women won&rsquo;t engage in interracial breeding or dating, they are engaging in discriminatory behavior. Somehow, bigotry and discrimination does not ALSO apply to black or Asian couples. ONLY white men and white women are supposed to be less choosy about who they will have children with.</p>
<p>Based on my own observations, and a few sociology books, black women are the population segment the MOST resistant to race mixing. This has been confirmed by numerous studies. This article says &#8220;African American women bear the brunt of discrimination from Caucasian men&#8221;. It does not explain that black women prefer it that way and very few are comfortable with the idea.</p>
<p>My uncle drove a taxi cab in Nashville for 42 years. He laughed about the subject of black women refusing dates with white men. The black women would say they have too much respect for themselves to date a white man. Ha Ha. So much for black women bearing the brunt of discrimination from white guys.<br>

		<p>I am very familiar with Chinese American culture.  I wonder what Arnold Chao&rsquo;s family would do if he presented them with a White or horror of horrors a black fiancee?</p>
<p>Probably bribe him with thousands of dollars to dump the girl and find a Chinese from their family&rsquo;s Chinese geographical area, same religion and same social, educational and financial status.</p>
<p>If he refused to dump the non Chinese the family would proceed to threats of ostracism, banishment from the family business and other sticks.</p>
<p>Plenty of Chinese Americans unto the 4th and 5th generation use the carrot and stick method to encourage their children to marry within the clan.  </p>
<p>Marry Chinese and get a car, big wedding, down payment on a house and parents will take over student loan payment.</p>
<p>Marry non Chinese or sometimes the wrong kind of Chinese and get disinherited and ostracized.</p>
<p>It is ok for girls to marry White men, but taboo for Chinese men to marry out of the race.</p>

		<p>How does the average white guy feel when he sees a Black man with a beautiful Asian female? Answer  &mdash;  Jealous. How does the same white guy feel when he sees a Black guy with a very unattractive overweight white woman? Answer  &mdash;  -Not Jealous.<br>

		<p><i>I have also observed that Asian men (East) tend not to show the same level of interest in white women as some other Oriental groups such as Middle Easterners.</i></p>
<p>That is quite perceptive. Arab dudes I have known really dig white women (especially blondes). Many rich middle Eastern men go the cheap route and hook up with a Russian or Ukrainian (who are not as picky as their Western European sisters - I also see quite a few in Macau and some in Hong Kong plying their wares).</p>
<p>Chinese men rarely display the same degree of interest in white women. Most will prefer their own (I have a white wife but on <i>average</i> certainly find East Asian women far more attractive). Chinese like smooth, ageless skin, soft Asian features (white women sometimes have a &#8216;mannish&rsquo; aspect) and simply find East Asian women more pristine, whereas they consider white woman to be quite haggardly looking at even a young age. Also there is of course the Caucasian odor which some Chinese find difficult to take.</p>
<p>Some Chinese guys I know who did marry white women, get itchy feet after the white woman has reached the age of 30 and starting to go downhill looks-wise. They then look wistfully at all the beautiful Chinese girls - and some act on this. </p>
<p>Bruce Lee was case in point. He married a white woman, had kids with her, but was fooling around with Betty Ting Pei at the same time - right up to his death.</p>
<p>As for this guy Arnold Chao - he seems a little stupid - nothing wrong with preferring on average the women of one race over another race. I prefer in descending order East Asian, Latin American, white, Middle Eastern, East Indian, black women.<br>

		<p><i>I can never understand why a group of people so aware of race always solely point to Asian women and white male relationships as due to Asian women preferring white men.</i></p>
<p>I think what is meant by this is generally it is Asian women, some of even normal &#8216;status&rsquo; will go with a very low, in fact lowest of the low white man.</p>
<p>An ugly, lazy, fat slob of a white man can get a reasonably decent Asian women.</p>
<p>So at a <i>group</i> level, Asian women are more desperate for white men than vice versa - ie poor quality white goods can attract good quality yellow goods - therefore white goods are more in demand.</p>
<p>But obviously at an individual level, I would assume both partners need each other about equally - the Asian woman for the passport perhaps (or even the status of going with a white), and the white man needs the Asian woman because he will be able to get any other type of woman.</p>
<p>The reason <i>Western</i> white men (not Eastern European men) are more prized in the East for dating partners is they generally have more money, and have dominated the world the past few centuries. But this will change soon.</p>
<p>But this does not excuse the actions of these Asian women - they are sell-outs through and through.</p>
<p>Funny thing is in the North East near the Russian border, it is generally Chinese men with Russian women, with hardly any Chinese women with Russian men.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see any problem with &#8216;interracial dating&rsquo;, so long as it involves the most marginal elements of the &#8216;white community&rsquo; outbreeding. In a way, this would probably be beneficial because it would improve the absolute quality of the &#8216;white gene pool&rsquo; and make it relatively more competitive. </p>
<p>As it stands now, there is a steadily growing &#8216;white underclass&rsquo; that is dragging down the average racial quality of those in the white camp. These people have much higher rates of obesity, criminal behavior, lower IQ scores, lower income, etc. On every factor except phenotype, they resemble blacks more than they do Old American &#8216;whites&rsquo;. Outbreeding is probably the best decision of them. Perhaps someone else can explain WHY outbreeding for these types would be undesirable?</p>

		<p>How typical this load of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; rubbish is; an Asian male married to a white sewage heifer, just feels an overwhelming urge to justify their romantic abnormalities for all the world to see. He then goes on to feebly attempt multicultural brainwashing &ldquo;techniques,&rdquo; to solidify his position (and those of his white gutter whore apparently) that miscegenation is a beyond trendy drift toward modernity in the USA. How strange, how strange indeed.</p>
<p>If interracial dating and procreation are both such wonderful and natural things, why do we need an endless propaganda blitz extolling their &ldquo;virtues?&rdquo; After all, eating, sleeping, and even defecating are all quite natural, and even wonderful in their own ways, yet they do not require a similar indoctrination process to continue unabated, so why does the mix and match mating game need it?</p>
<p>That is an easy question to answer; miscegenation is abnormal and disgusting, and only a societal sickness such as institutionalized multiculturalism would encourage it!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>Miscegenation is the dog that didn&rsquo;t bark, doesn&rsquo;t bark, and won&rsquo;t bark. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem. It means that despite all the pleasant sounding PC chit chit, no significant segment of American society is race mixing. It means that the liberals talk the talk and then go home to their racially segregated neighborhoods with their same-race spouse and children. </p>
<p>Ever listen to blacks? Black women want black men. They don&rsquo;t want any other kind of man. Medium or light skinned black women say it loud, they want a dark dark black brother. They don&rsquo;t want to vanish as a race, they want to continue into the future as black people. Whites want the same thing whether they admit it or not. Asians want the same, and Latinos want the same. </p>
<p>When races meet, either they mix and make a new race, or they go their separate ways. Americans are not mixing, and that means that sooner or later we will go our separate ways. The decision is not being made by any intellectual or political propaganda; it is being made by everyday people of every walk of life of their own free will. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Can you blame the TV producers and advertisers for playing it safe by catering to the majority? After all, they measure what appeals to a mass audience and go with what we&rsquo;re familiar with. It&rsquo;s no mystery that stereotyping the population is much easier than representing eclectic subgroups within our population.&#8221;</p>
<p>   I wonder what rock this commentator has been living under? Does he really believe the media doesn&rsquo;t promote miscegenation? How many local news reports feature a black man and an attractive white woman? It&rsquo;s also hard to find many TV commercials that don&rsquo;t actively push diversity.</p>

		<p>As a normal White male, I have always considered the idea of interracial dating loathsome and disgusting. Utterly degrading to the White male or female. I firmly believe the attraction of White females to Black males has to be motivated by a desire to rebel against parental guidance and teaching, against society mores in general. </p>
<p>Of course, if you look at interractial couples (Black male with White female), it is far from unusual the White female being so plain, if not downright ugly, grossly fat or otherwise repellant that White males apparently never showed an interest in the female. Statistically, I&rsquo;d guestimate that in interracial relationships, the White female&rsquo;s appearance is noticeably the kind most of us Whites would have little interest in to begin with.</p>

		<p>As a single male I dont think their will ever be much of a problem with white men dating black women as white men just do not find black women attractive. Once in a while it happens but usually with a mal adjusted white guy who can not get a white girl, in other words by default .  The problem lies with the white girls who seem to worship the black thugs. If you will notice you dont see the white girls with the clean cut blacks, its the bottom of the barrels thug types. Most every saturday night I go to a huge upscale nightclub with at least 1000 people there. Without fail at 11.30 the black males start pouring in and the white girls are all over them and its sickening but what can we do. It seems that they have first choice for a lot of the girls under about 30. The older women dont do it much but they are beyond thier childbearing years. I see a real problem for the future when 10% or so of the white males have no girls to reproduce with because they are having little Bamas. Beyond the fact that whites have a lot birthrate, it gets even worse when 10% or so of our white girls prefer to breed black.  KF         </p>

		<p>As miscegenation has reared its ugly head over the past thirty or so years, it is apparent that miscegenation laws were wise and I support them.  These laws were necessary because lower class white women tend to make poor choices in life and think with their emotions and not their brains.  Today, with public schools and television telling white women and girls that it is dandy that they mate with their black equals, the lack of miscegenation laws is acutely felt.  Of course, another way to look at it is that the genetics of the morally and mentally defective white women who choose to mate with blacks is permanently swept from the white gene pool.</p>

		<p><i>How does the average white guy feel when he sees a Black man with a beautiful Asian female? Answer &mdash; Jealous. </i></p>
<p>I have personally seen white men very uncomfortable when they see a black guy with an Asian woman!</p>
<p>This was also noticed by James Michener (I forgot the book). White soldiers stationed in Korea and Japan in the immediate post-war period did not like it when black solidiers dated Asian girls.</p>

<p>The author notes that whites often show disapproval towards black men with yellow women. His explanation seems right on the money to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;the yellow woman is considered the white man&rsquo;s exclusive toy, and he is not willing to share this toy with other men of any color&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously White nationlism has nothing to do with &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; or &lsquo;reciprococity&rsquo; as Jared Taylor would say.</p>

		<p>Miscegenation is not worth worrying about. As we can see from the table above, whites overwhelmingly prefer to marry whites.   The problems worth worrying about on the other hand are these white couple getting married too late and not having enough children, and the generally toxic non-white and anti-white cultural and media environment that all of us have to live in.   </p>

		<p>I agree with 14 Anonymous.  I don&rsquo;t know anything about the dating habits of Oriental women, but there are definitely White guys with &#8220;Yellow fever&#8221;, that is, they date a succession of Oriental women.  Once is random, twice might happen, three times means they are deliberately seeking a little woman they hope to dominate.  <br>
     18 Mike Harrigan is right too.  No way I&rsquo;m going to believe that a third of the Black/White couples in this country are Black woman/White man.  I&rsquo;d say that maybe one in 20 is more like it.  Men who wish to defile themselves choose other ways to do so.  <br>
     30 Historama makes a good point.  Shifting the White trash from our gene pool to theirs has its merits, but there are also a large number of intelligent but brainwashed or depressed White women who associate with Blacks.  I see them, blonde women in nice cars with a Black thug riding shotgun.  The woman can afford the Lexus, the Black doesn&rsquo;t even have a driver&rsquo;s license.  In a healthy society these women might be salvaged.  <br>

		<p>The real obstacle to inter-racial dating for white women who lust for Kobe,Wilt, or Dacron or is it Dayglo, I can`t remember, is medical insurance. These women wil need it for their trips to the ER with for broken orbital bones, fractured pelvises from being thrown down steps, stds unknown to modern medicine, gun shot wounds,facial scaring from knife cuts, and Aids delivered from their down low mates. This is not hyperbole. All these are real caes from the the NBA, NFL, and MLB.<br>
     If it is this bad from black men with money, imagine the hell white women endure in the projects. I found it odd that the miscegenist left out medical insurance. He must be a government affrimative action race mixing hero, possibly an Obama wannabee.<br>

<p>This is true.  It is interesting to look back at white females I knew in high school who either dated or ended up marrying black males. These particular girls never received the attention from the popular white guys that their more attractive friends did. Thus, they suddenly developed an interest in the black males who would take just about any white girl they could get. </p>
<p>I also find it annoying when white girls who date a black man have the nerve to complain later when white men will have nothing to do with them after they learn of their past associations.  Can you really blame us?  </p>

<p>Most likely a stripper with her drug mule. White strippers typically have some money. The black thug lives off of her money and he, in turn, is her pipeline into the local drug market. These women may be pleasing to the eye but they are mental basket cases with severe drug problems. Perhaps these women can be salvaged but it would take quite effort.</p>

     As for the White soldiers in Korea and elsewhere objecting to Blacks mating with the local women, it is only reasonable.  They didn&rsquo;t allow Blacks into White swimming pools back then because they peed in the water.  In some places, Blacks were allowed into the public pools on Monday, the day before the weekly draining.  Why should a society that keeps its swimming pools clean want to have Blacks and their unsavory habits fouling its other amusements? </p>

		<p>Please allow me to pose a question regarding miscegenation to your readers who are parents. As one who generally eschews movies and TV, I was recently appalled and disgusted on a recent movie outing with my 12 year-old son. I took him to see the new Star Trek movie, and was sickened by the amount of interracial face-sucking and romance. The previews, and the feature movie itself, were one big promotion for interracial coupling, ad nauseum.

<p>If i may be allowed to expand on this and be more to the point. About thirty years ago, a young black woman (who i known from high school,) and myself were having a discussion about interracial dating. At one point during the discussion she confessed and remarked to me-that she would not feel right giving her body to a white boy. </p>

		<p><i>Recognizing the biased reality of the media business in itself resolves much of the adverse impact of broadcasted stereotypes. Avoid &ldquo;keeping up with the Joneses&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t think you have to date like all the idealized couples the generic media fodder has fed you. Boil your beliefs down to what really matters to you, and you&rsquo;ll become stereotype-resistant.</i></p>
<p>This part is hilarious.  The biased reality of the media business is that they <i>always</i> show a pretty white blonde woman dating a black man.  Every chance they get.  If white women are dumb enough to fall for that there soon won&rsquo;t be any white people left.  Which is what the media wants.</p>

<p>While I would agree that there are more Black Men/White women couples than the reverse, the factis that there is indeed a growing number of White male/Black female couples. I see it where I live. </p>
<p>The most disturbing thing about this growing trend is that these are not the bottom of the barrel type of White men. They are not losers so to speak. In fact, many of these couples tend to be attractive, upscale and successful. Hopefully, this is not a sign of things to come. </p>

<p>Let your kids know your views in interracial marriage and dating and why it&rsquo;s not a good idea. Tell them that people of all races usually prefer their own. Periodically let your children know that the media and Hollywood like to brainwash the masses, often pushing junk and that often a small group of media people try to push their beliefs openly and subtley on people. When you see a TV show or commerical openly or subtley do this, on any issue, point it out later. When they show interracial dating, do the same later on, point out how they are trying to influence the masses .</p>

<p>While you certainly have the right to marry whom you want, I wouldn&rsquo;t rule  someone out because they weren&rsquo;t raised in a full father-mother family. I would look at the woman&rsquo;s attitude toward family. There are people raised in a two-parent home who end up marrying 3 or 4 times and people who were raised in a home with no father who are very much into family and wanting a two-parent home for their kids. It depends upon the person.</p>

		<p>59 Richard: Of course some Whites pee in pools.  But a much greater proportion of Blacks do than Whites.  Your next question will likely be, How do I know?  Do I put urine monitors on everyone who goes swimming?  No, I know it is true because Blacks excel in every sort of anti-social behavior, leaving Whites in the dust.  Do you imagine that a demographic group that has a murder rate 11 times greater than Whites would not also have a pool-urinating rate 11 times that of Whites?  <br>
     Given their weaknesses and failings of in every humane and civilized activity, what would need proof and explanation would be hygienic, cooperative behavior by Blacks, not pool-urinating.</p>

		<p>71 Edward: let&rsquo;s turn the thread back towards the original topic, Black sexuality.  Does it seem to you plausible that a demographic group that has such high rates of venereal disease would not also have much higher rates of pool fouling?  It wasn&rsquo;t me who established those Blacks-get-to-swim-the-day-before-cleaning-day policies many years ago.  I personally feel confident that a test of the pool water in any Black neighborhood will show higher levels of everything you don&rsquo;t want, including semen, than a pool in a White neighborhood.

<p>I see the same where I live. I live in college town,/upscale community. Whether it is at the local Starbucks, bistros, civic centers&hellip;.I have seen a number of Black women/White men couples. Many of the Black women tend to have non-Black features such as long hair, attractive figure, in good shape, and a number look biracial, but I do see this trend happening. </p>
<p>Like you said these couples are attractive and tend to be at the minimum solid middle class. In fact, many of them look and tend to be upper class unlike many of the White women/Black men couples I see.  <br>

<p>If you ask me, BF/WM couples who are upscale are hardly using one another. I don&rsquo;t know for certain, but it strikes that a well educated, good looking, physically fit White men with money who could marry most White women if they decided to do so, would not have to marry a Black woman. If he does (and statistics are show that this practice has become more commonplace)it is because he probably genuinely loves her and vice versa.</p>

The man was attractive, blond haired and well groomed. The little girl kept asking him questions &#8220;daddy this, daddy that.&#8221; This was a dark skinned Black child.

		<p>Melanie. I appriciate your comment. But why does&rsquo;nt a well educated white man with money, meet and fall in love with a white woman? When i was in high school, about thirty nine years ago, i was teamates, basketball (and yes, AT THAT TIME, he was a close friend of mine,) with a good looking black guy. You know, a Denzel Washington, Clifton Davis and young Muhammad Ali type. He was quiet, reserve-not militant in any way. Genuinely liked by everyone. And a large number of white girls-pretty middle class ones-in school just loved him. And of course he liked a number of them. I understand he now lives in S.C. and is married to a black woman and has family. Anyway, i remember asking him once, a few years after high school, why he ended up with a black woman instead of a white woman. His answer, and it was a very plain spoken one, was; why should i settle for a white woman, when i could have SOMETHING BETTER.</p>
