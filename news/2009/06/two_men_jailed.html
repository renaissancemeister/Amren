			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (Manchester), June 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two men have been jailed for their part in a horrific torture, robbery and rape of a couple in Clapham.</p>
<p>At Inner London Crown Court today, Reon Hall, aged 20, of Malcolm Road, Coulsdon, and Aaron Fitzgerald Gelly, aged 20, of Ferrers Avenue, Wallington, were both sentenced to nine years&rsquo; jail for unlawful imprisonment and robbery.</p>
<p>A 26-year-old woman was leaving her flat in Clapham half an hour after midnight on October 26, 2008, the court was told.</p>
<p>As she was getting into her car, she heard a noise in the bushes.</p>
<p>Before she was able to close the door, a man started to walk towards her.</p>
<p>He demanded she give him money but she had none.</p>
<p>He was followed by several more men and one of the suspects covered her head and forced her to go back inside the flat, accompanied by all of them.</p>
<p>They forced her to send a text to her boyfriend to ask him to come over.</p>
<p>While they waited, they ate and drank food from her fridge.</p>
<p>When he arrived, they demanded money from him and he said he did not have any.</p>
<p>They tied his hands with his own belt and began to torture him.</p>
<p>One of the suspects took the woman to the bedroom where he forced her to perform oral sex while holding a gun to her head.</p>
<p>Over the next few hours, he repeatedly raped her as she heard her boyfriend screaming in the next room.</p>
<p>The male victim was repeatedly kicked and punched.</p>
<p>Computer cable was wrapped around his throat.</p>
<p>He was then repeatedly struck on the head and face with a metal object believed to be a firearm, while a towel was kept over his head.</p>
<p>A hot iron was pressed against his forehead and thigh, and then lemon juice and bleach were poured and rubbed in to his injuries.</p>
<p>Both victims were subjected to a three-hour sustained attack, before the suspects eventually left, stealing both cars, a black Skype 3G mobile phone, a black Nokia mobile phone, Â£220 cash and keys.</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Mick Foote, of the Met&rsquo;s Specialist Crime Directorate, said: &#8220;Both victims were subjected to unnecessary physical violence in their own home.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were targeted for money and then assaulted over and over again, despite saying they had no money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendants took a small amount of property, including mobile phones, and made their escape by stealing the victims&rsquo; cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was immediately reported to police and within a short time both cars were recovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a cigarette butt in the bedroom and it contained DNA relating to the two men in court today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both victims have suffered a very traumatic event.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, I would like to reassure the public that such crimes are very rare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hall, also known as Reon Wong, and Gelly both pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing in March to one count of false imprisonment and two charges of robbery.</p>

		<p>By American standards, this is a shockingly light sentence.  Rape committed with a deadly weapon is punished extremely harshly in the USA.  Add to that kidnapping, robbery and torture, and you would typically end up with the perpetrators serving many decades in prison,if not the rest of their lives.  </p>

<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to see here,&#8221; the authorities will say.</p>
<p>And neighbors?  Well it didn&rsquo;t happen to them or their immediate family so this horrible incident will pass down the wormhole waiting for the next story that will be just are awful.</p>
<p>Those of us who would say to throw the foreigner out - we will be looked at as the real criminals.  </p>

		<p>If a society allows this kind of crime to go on with virtually no penalty, it continues. </p>
<p>Sentences like these:&ldquo;Both victims have suffered a very traumatic event.&#8221;<br>
&ldquo;However, I would like to reassure the public that such crimes are very rare.&rdquo; don&rsquo;t BEGIN to describe what the couple went through. It&rsquo;s disgusting. If no one will stand up for us, it&rsquo;s time to stand up for ourselves.</p>

		<p>These pilgrims only get nine years? Good grief, in Britain, one can get half of that for a so-called &#8220;hate crime&#8221; that would not even be illegal in the U.S. I&rsquo;m afraid that decent Britons have a very dim future. These types of incidents will only increase. </p>

		<p>They were sentenced to nine years - which means they&rsquo;ll be out in about five.  Then they&rsquo;ll go back do it again, probably murdering the couple in the process.  The &#8220;justice&#8221; system in Britain is a cruel joke indeed.</p>

		<p>Oh, yes indeed. Black crimes such as this is so rare&hellip;Blacks commit these types of crimes 24/7 and it usually involves White victims 99.9% of the time! I am so sick of hearing these lies and excuses made for ANY minority who commits crimes. They sure don&rsquo;t say that when in very rare instances it is a White perp, do they?  Just look at what they are doing to Von Bruun as only one example. </p>

		<p>&#8220;However, I would like to reassure the public that such crimes are very rare.&rdquo; Oh PLEASE! What a blad face lie and everyone knows it! They are all too common and will only increase when whites are reduced to nothing in Britian. Take a look at the brutality of white victims in South Africa for crying out loud! </p>
<p>As I stated earlier gang rapes signify the power of the new rulers, per say to the nation (a defeated nation) spoils of war and that happens to be the rape white woman to let the &#8220;white men&#8221; in the nation no who&rsquo;s boss now.</p>
<p>And do you really think that once we, white people are truly the minority in our own country that our founding forefathers fought, died and bled for will be treated nicely with items from the Government such as Affirmative Action and will hate crimes now extended to us, white people, will we be allowed to have a Civil Rights origination that the taxpayer funds to the tune of billions of dollars are year to protect us, white people? NOT ON YOUR LIFE!  </p>
<p>Stand up now and start the deportations by force if necessary and it will be or perish. And start having more babies, like 3 or 4 each. Which will it be? <br>

		<p>This only remotely ties in with the story, but as I was walking through my rapidly-becoming-section-8ed-to-death Bay Area suburb today, it somehow occurred to me that the movie &#8220;Gremlins&#8221; is in many ways an apt metaphor for what&rsquo;s happened with blacks here in the U.S. and now in Britain. Water, feeding after midnight = welfare, expanded Section 8 programs/immigration. Sunlight = what we desperately need. I know, I know; I&rsquo;m tired and about to doze off over here, but seriously, just think about the bar scene in that flick. Okay, I&rsquo;ll shut up now. </p>

		<p>In England, all prisoners are automatically entitled to parole after serving 2/3rds of their declared sentence.<br>
 It is very rare for parole to be refused.Therefore the nine year sentence in reality means six years.<br>
  In Britain there are around 80,000 prisoners in jail at any one time.The number of prisoners (and I&rsquo;m really talking about the most horrific murderers here), who have actually served sentences greater than 20 years is vanishingly small perhaps not mounting to a hundred.In fact the &#8216;average&rsquo; murderer usually serves no more than 12 or so years behind bars, and again a sentence of more 10 years in the British prison system is an outstanding rarity.<br>
  Incarceration is enormously expensive - this is probably the British Government&rsquo;s main reason for quietly releasing prisoners on the sly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had the British cops taken the trouble to learn the sad lessons of the US they would be aware that, as the nation darkens, such crimes will become increasingly less rare.&#8221; Posted by Ronald</p>
<p>And how do we fix the dilemma? We&rsquo;re the ones who brought their ancestors here (U.S)as slaves (which I&rsquo;m sure the vast majority of readers condemn). We can hardly shift them back, it would be the peak of cruelty. Perhaps there could be some sort of program to reduce crime rates. Not having much knowledge of the topic though, I don&rsquo;t know how it could be done.</p>

<p>We fix this dilemma by not tolerating it any more. No exceptions. Blacks don&rsquo;t want to be part of a white society, they want the white society. But when they get it, they destroy it. Look at South Africa and Rhodesia. America, Great Brittan, Australia, Europe, Canada are all dealing with the same scenarios. Non-white populations are allowed to flood in and the white population gets to drown in &#8220;the blessing of diversity&#8221;. If whites don&rsquo;t acknowledge and act immediately, they may as well kiss their heritage and progeny good-bye.</p>

		<p>These blacks get nine years for forcible rape, assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and possession of a gun. When Caucasian farmer Tony Martin defended himself against robbers with a shotgun a few years ago, they gave him something like 20 years.</p>
<p>Blacks like these two only prove what Enoch Powell said over 40 years ago; and what Nick Griffin and the BNP are saying today. Yet, Britain considers the BNP to be the greater criminals.</p>
