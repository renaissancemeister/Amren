			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James McCarthy, Media Wales (Cardiff), June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>STRICT new visa controls have left a ballet company facing closure.</p>
<p>The Ballet Russe has for the past 10 years had Bolshoi-trained dancers working from Swansea.</p>
<p>But it is now facing closure after months of expensive negotiations trying to get work permits for its dancers.</p>
<p>At one point the UK Border Agency even suggested they use locals instead.</p>
<p>Director Celia Kirkby said: &#8220;We are made up of all Russian dancers and have been at the Grand Theatre for 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dancers go home every summer to visit their families and this year we could not get them back because of changes to immigration rules. Six of our dancers we need to get back. So the company just isn&rsquo;t performing. It&rsquo;s a tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;The UK Border Agency were not interested in any aspects of the case. Their starting position was: &#8216;If you want dancers use the local labour force.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are very few dancers in the world trained in the Russian style, let alone in the UK, Wales or Swansea.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said we should advertise in the local and national newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visa controls are part of the Government&rsquo;s new points-based immigration system. The rules for touring artists came into effect last November. Artists must show they have Â£800 savings and require monitoring by a &#8216;sponsor&rsquo; to make sure they do not abscond.</p>
<p>A report by anti-red tape campaigners The Manifesto Club, titled UK Arts and Culture: Cancelled by Order of the Home Office, found more than 20 major events had been cancelled or badly affected by the new rules.</p>
<p>A UK Border Agency spokesman said: &#8220;We are determined to deliver a system of border security which is among the most secure in the world. It combines more than 80 pre- existing work and study routes into the United Kingdom into five tiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any organisation which used to bring entertainers into the UK under the old work permit system is welcome to apply to the UK Border Agency to become a sponsor  &mdash;  allowing them to employ foreign workers under the new points-based system. If an organisation does not apply to become a sponsor, it will be unable to employ skilled migrant workers through the points-based system.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Well, if they are bothering to ASK the Border Agency, of course they will be told no   &mdash;   they are in the business of harassing law-abiding businesses, while turning a blind eye to however many hundreds of thousands of illegal Africans and Pakistanis are running around the country.</p>
<p>Rather than asking, just bring the dancers in on tourist visas and have them start performing.  No one will notice or care.  And on the off chance that they are caught, the dancers can claim they are &#8220;human rights activists&#8221; on the run from Putin&rsquo;s agents, and the Brown government will grant them asylum faster than you can say Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>Like the US, Britain&rsquo;s self appointed mentally challenged elites are stark raving mad in addition to being stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting these same geeks responsible for throwing barriers in the way of the dancers would break both legs getting visas for jihadists.</p>
<p>The West is finished.</p>

		<p>Gosh, that&rsquo;s sooooo much better.  Let&rsquo;s close off Russians to UK, but let in muslim extremists and non-whites who hate the native brits.  I mean, those Russians are so much more of a danger to a historically and majority-white nation like England than Pakis or Arabs or Africans, right?</p>

		<p>Problem: White ballet dancers cannot enter the U.K. due to &#8220;visa problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>Solution: Heavy tanning, conversion to Islam, invented back-story of &#8220;fleeing a warzone&#8221;. Truck hiding skills optional.</p>

		<p>Years ago I read that even &ldquo;Western&rdquo; Whites had problems getting visas to the United Kingdom, while non-whites were flooding in.</p>
<p>If these White Russian ballerinas had been ju ju witches from Uganda or gypsy soothsayers from Bulgaria there would be no problem for a visa or for extra welfare benefits, which no White Briton could get!<br>

		<p>With this and Napoliono&rsquo;s tirade against the Canadian border, we can see that when a liberal government decides to crack down on immigration, white people have got to go.  </p>

		<p>this is a clever tactic by the &#8216;enemy&rsquo; - while they are meant to demonstrate how destructive tight immigration is to our culture and society - its to ease pressure off restricting immigration in general.</p>
<p>Also, as with enforcing ilegal immigraiton in the US (and hate crime laws) - they might open themselves to &#8216;hate&rsquo; charges if a disproportionate number of minorities were denied visas.</p>

		<p>Ballet is a form of reactionary bourgeois white oppression. The British should instead watch traditional African or urban-street dancing.<br>
You know sometimes I can&rsquo;t help but suspect that the governments of the West WANT their citizens to become stupid uncultured half-animals.<br>
I really hate to bring up reality TV but its just another example of the vast conspiracy (if you can call it that) to undermine and discredit European culture in favor of &#8220;diverse&#8221; culture. In the latest round of &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s got talent&#8221; the unattractive but musically talented underdog (a white woman) that everyone was rooting for was beaten by a non-white &#8220;dance troop&#8221; called&hellip;&#8221;diversity&#8221; THEIR NAME WAS &#8220;DIVERSITY&#8221;! Musical theater is clearly not diverse enough! Boyle was the white woman that the common Britain identified with but she was beaten by some street urchins. I know it sounds trivial but its part of a larger pattern of the mass media deliberately undermining all things European in favor of ethnic nonsense. </p>

		<p>We all know how the Russian ballerinas have ruined one good British neighborhood after another with their graffiti, robbery, and street gangs.  No wonder Labour wants to keep them out. </p>
