			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Foster, AP, June 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five of six black teens accused of beating a white high school classmate in a case that led to the biggest civil rights protest in decades will plead guilty in a deal expected to be finalized this week, Louisiana court officials involved with the case told The Associated Press on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The six students were initially charged with attempted murder in the 2006 attack on Justin Barker and became known as the &#8220;Jena Six,&#8221; after the town where the beating took place.</p>
<p>Charges against Carwin Jones, Jesse Ray Beard, Robert Bailey Jr., Bryant Purvis and Theo Shaw were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery.</p>
<p>Court officials, who asked not to be identified because the agreement was not yet public, told the AP that those five will plead to lesser charges Friday but would not be specific. Officials also would not talk about penalties.</p>
<p>A sixth defendant, Mychal Bell, pleaded guilty in December 2007 to a misdemeanor second-degree battery charge and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The severity of the original charges brought widespread criticism and eventually led more than 20,000 people to converge in September 2007 on the tiny central Louisiana town of Jena for a major civil rights march.</p>
<p>Racial tensions at Jena High School reportedly grew throughout in the months before the attack. Several months before attack, nooses were hung in a tree on the campus, sparking outrage in the black community. Residents said there were fights, but nothing too serious until December 2006 when Barker was attacked.</p>
<p>Barker was knocked unconscious as the lunch period was ending. He was hit and kicked by the defendants as he lay on the ground, according to court testimony. Pictures from the emergency room show his face was swollen and bloodied, but he was not admitted and was able to attend a school function that same night.</p>
<p>Barker graduated that spring and is now working on an oil rig, according to Henry Lemoine Jr., the attorney representing Barker in the civil cases.</p>

		<p>Aside from this AP blurb, the MSM aren&rsquo;t making a big deal out of this.  They cannot, lest their whole narrative about the Jena Six Thugs as persecuted angels would fall apart.</p>
<p>And again, the MSM push the lie that the tree and the beatings were related.  The only reason why anyone thinks that is that a far left Dallas Preacher named Alan Beany Baby rode in to Jena and stirred up stuff (to speak diplomatically).  I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that there was at least one white person in America murdered by a black because of the perceived &#8220;injustice&#8221; that nobody thought of until Alan Beany Baby flapped his lips.  We do know that a young white man is sitting in Federal prison because he drove by the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; protestors with a noose tied to the cab of his truck.  Alan Beany Baby&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>The nooses were never true and dispelled. That LIE is still being told. Enough already! </p>
<p>Justin was not victimized once, but thrice 1) The near death beating. 2) The un-civil rights march and 3) the mob of lying media! A witch hunt indeed. </p>
<p>Just wait until we are reduced to a minority within our own borders! You have not seen anything yet.<br>

		<p>After all the lies. After all the excuses. After all the protests, we arrive at the truth; guilty.</p>
<p>This just shows that the whole Jena 6 incident was a scam; a typical black tactic to turn predators into victims and an innocent white teen into someone who deserved to be beaten.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Racial tensions at Jena High School reportedly grew throughout in the months before the attack. Several months before attack, nooses were hung in a tree on the campus, sparking outrage in the black community.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course, the media has to keep the lie alive by reporting on events that had nothing to do with an unprovoked, gang attack.</p>

<p>Funny that the author <i>doesn&rsquo;t even <b>mention</b></i> that Barker <b>had <i>nothing at all</i></b> to do with the nooses, slurs or fights:<br>
I doubt Ms. Foster, or her journalist brethren, would be quite as forgiving if six white kids assaulted a random black teenager.</p>

		<p>I suspect there are torts that could be filed in a cause of action against Sharpton and Jesse as well for lying so shamelessly about the details of the crime they defamed the Barker boy.  </p>
<p>This is why a white group like the NAACP would be invaluable.  They would have the inclination and the funds to pursue civil action in other areas against others in this case, including, and especially, Howard Witt and the Chicago newspaper he works for.  His account of the incident was rife with blatant lies.</p>
<p>I think malice might be a possibility to prove due to their obvious distortion of the facts, knowing full well Witt and the paper were lying at the time the stories were written.</p>
<p>But, in any event, there are now anti-white cases being filed and civil action being won all across the country.  I would like to see the white community accelerate their lawsuits against black attacks.  It&rsquo;s the one way they can be beaten back, and it puts the spineless white prosecutors and police brass on notice they could lose in court as well for failing to properly charge defendants in anti-white hate crimes.</p>

		<p>It is amazing how the mainstream media reported this case. Most said the incident was a schoolyard fight. Six thugs blindside one lone victim and continue to pummel him while he lay unconsious on the ground and that qualifies as a schoolyard fight? Of course we all know their verbiage would be dramatically altered if the victim was black and the thugs who attacked him white. </p>
<p>The worst part of this whole fiasco is the national story has taught countless blacks of the minor consequences for attempting to kill a white. </p>

		<p>it seems to me, that this culture war we are fighting, and losing, is because of the power of the news media and their blatant false reporting and their anti-white positions. now here is something we all need to think about. with the decline of the liberal printed news media, and the market that will be available because of it, why haven&rsquo;t some young white enteprenuers, with the help of some older financiers, started up some conservative newspapers all over the country? they could make millions. and as it grew and grew, our conservative information would counter the lies of the msm. talk it up fellas, talk it up. look at the success of fox news in the last few years. the same thing could be done in the print media.</p>

		<p>Folks, crimes of this nature are not going to stop.  It may have very well happened already and just did not get the publicity due to its sensitive nature.  Suppose a Back man or group kills a White because they percieved the White calling them ni**er(s).  Sense the White is dead, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if this really happened or not.  All that matters is the Black says he did.  The Black(s)&rsquo; defense/justification for killing the White will be that the White called him the N-Word and he just lost control of his emotions/actions.  It is very concievable that the sentence/charges would be reduced (or, heaven forbid, dismissed).  There will be no mention of a hate crime.  At least, not on the part of the Black.  Of course, us Whites would, as usual, hush up and move on.</p>
<p>Be ready to act on this scenario my brothers because I believe it&rsquo;s going to happen if it hasn&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>The world is on fire and We&rsquo;d better wake up.</p>

		<p>Notice the use of the words attack and beating instead of the usual school yard fight that implies one on one.This is an improvement for the AP.The truth is slowly leaking out.</p>

		<p>As reported, 20,000 Blacks protested into a Riot, because the &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; were charged with attempted murder, which was apporpriate for the crime. </p>
<p>Yet, I have seen no response to my request of a similar march and protest for the beating death of Christopher Jones, in Maryland, as well as the torture, mutilation, and murder of Channon Christian, and Christopher Newsome, in Tennessee. </p>
<p>Do their deaths, in such horrible ways, mean nothing to the Whites in this Country? What does it take to light a fire under your asses?</p>
<p>How many deaths, in such brutal ways, are acceptable, before we do something about it, besides talk, or post our &#8220;Outrage&#8221;?</p>
<p>Nothing will change in this Country, unless we are willing to take to the streets, and tell these sell-out Politicians that we have had enough. </p>

		<p>They will get a light token sentence now that the public has forgotten the injustices committed at Duke against innocent men.<br>
By the way, what is Nifong doing now? I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s quietly raking thousands in a new cushy job that his unjust prosecution got him.</p>

Very true - that case is a shining example of the despicable unfairness, and undemocratic nature of &#8216;justice&rsquo; in modern America. We all know that blacks, in general, are far more violent than whites, and these &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; laws are there solely to prevent blacks from acting out the way they almost always do, whenever they perceive &#8216;injustice&rsquo; against them - i.e. white people not wanting to be around them, or not bowing down to them and their demands.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do as white Americans is demand a true democratic system, whereby you vote on weekly basis, for policies, not politicians, and not for political parties. A nation wide vote, using the Robinson Voting Method, which is fraud proof, and provides immediate results, every single week, on whatever YOU, the people, want to vote on.</p>
<p>Until this happens, nothing is going to change, and things are going to continue to get worse as our countries are taken over by the third world.</p>
