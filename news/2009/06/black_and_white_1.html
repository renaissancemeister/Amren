			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tour√©, New York Magazine, June 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Clintons are expected to return to Edgartown, where they have often stayed at the home of Richard Friedman, a Boston real-estate developer. Caroline Kennedy will be at her mother&rsquo;s former estate in Aquinnah. And while the Obamas&rsquo; plans are still unannounced, most people expect the First Family to settle on Oak Bluffs, at the northeast end of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if the Obamas do choose West Chop [which is totally white], they&rsquo;ll surely spend considerable time in Oak Bluffs, a town known for attracting most of the upper-class black professionals who stay on the island. As liberal as it is, the Vineyard is about as racially integrated as a college dining hall  &mdash;  blacks and whites get along fine, but they generally don&rsquo;t socialize. &#8220;There&rsquo;s not a lot of overlap between black and white,&#8221; says radio executive Skip Finley, who started vacationing in Oak Bluffs in 1954 and has been living there full-time for the past decade. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s insulted by it. I&rsquo;m certainly not.&#8221; It&rsquo;s an arrangement that springs largely from the self-segregating impulse among black Vineyarders, who have come to the island to connect with each other. &#8220;We have people here who are black and upscale and racist,&#8221; Finley continues. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to be around white folks, and they don&rsquo;t have to.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>In 1912, a former slave named Charles Shearer opened the first summer inn in Oak Bluffs that catered specifically to black patrons. Only a few dozen blacks visited the island at the time, but over the years Oak Bluffs has become the summer meeting place for scores of what could be called the Only Ones  &mdash;  black professional and social elites who travel in worlds where they&rsquo;re often the only black person in the room. The Only Ones typically break into fields or companies that admit few blacks, move into neighborhoods where few blacks live, and send their kids to mostly white schools. They are not running from their own  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re chasing after the best they can get. They aren&rsquo;t assimilationist; they&rsquo;re ascensionist.</p>
<p>Senator Edward Brooke, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Ethel Waters, Paul Robeson, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. all made visits to Oak Bluffs. The novelist Dorothy West moved to the island in the forties, working for the Vineyard Gazette first as a file clerk and then, for decades, as a columnist who wrote about the prominent blacks visiting the island. Today&rsquo;s summer vacationers come from the worlds of academia (like Harvard professors Skip Gates, Charles Ogletree, and Lani Guinier), media (NPR correspondent Charlayne Hunter-Gault, former ABC News anchor Carole Simpson), film (directors Spike Lee and Reggie Hudlin), and politics (Valerie Jarrett, who hosted the Obamas in 2007). &#8220;If you&rsquo;re upper-middle class and black, this is your spot,&#8221; Finley says. &#8220;You&rsquo;re going to find a way to spend a little bit of quality time here on this island.&#8221; In Oak Bluffs, the Only Ones become one of many. &#8220;I went to a garden party last weekend,&#8221; Simpson says, &#8220;and you would not believe the occupations of the people I met there. It&rsquo;s like all the African-American East Coast professionals have chosen this place to socialize with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Only Ones deal with glass ceilings at work, unfortunate misunderstandings in their neighborhoods, condescension from blacks who think their education or class makes them inauthentic, and identity crises in their kids. When they get to their Vineyard vacation homes, they want to escape that casual, institutional, and intra-black racism and be around people who help them feel less anomalous. Trey Ellis, who wrote the script for The Inkwell, the notoriously bad film about the black Vineyard experience (Ellis himself called it terrible), says, &#8220;The black part of the Vineyard is like, I would imagine, being gay and going to the Castro. It&rsquo;s this mecca where you can be yourself and be with people who have so much in common with you. No one has to feign some street cred when they&rsquo;re playing tennis.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a source of communion and of pride. &#8220;When you see a beautiful black family with their kids, it makes you feel really good about being black,&#8221; says Chrisette Hudlin, wife of Reggie and a lifelong Vineyarder who travels there every summer from L.A. &#8220;As a person who&rsquo;s high-achieving and striving for the best for their family, you&rsquo;re looking at these other black people who have the same goals, and it makes you feel good as a black person. You don&rsquo;t feel out of place.&#8221; Several Only Ones say there&rsquo;s nowhere in America that makes them more proud of black people.</p>
<p>This is particularly true among parents, who talk about the importance of introducing their children to other black upper-class families so they can know they&rsquo;re not as peculiar as they might feel. &#8220;Black kids need to be around successful black families, because other blacks from humble beginnings want you to apologize for being successful,&#8221; says psychiatrist Carlotta Miles. &#8220;On the Vineyard, you don&rsquo;t need excuses or self-consciousness or defensiveness.&#8221; Drew Dixon Williams grew up in Washington, D.C., where her mother, Sharon Pratt, served as mayor, and she spent summers on the island. &#8220;It&rsquo;s sort of embarrassing to say this, coming from Washington,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but I used to say with a straight face  &mdash;  because I was too young to know better  &mdash;  that I would get my black experience on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. I didn&rsquo;t have to be defensive about not being black enough or being black in the first place. We were all from The Cosby Show.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And while the Only Ones embrace each other, they can be dismissive of other blacks. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re too Southern Baptist, too dark-skinned, too street, you might not be insulted by a white person but you may be insulted by a black person,&#8221; says Columbia law professor Patricia Williams. &#8220;It resembles the way in Britain race and class are inflected. If you&rsquo;re a Nigerian prince and you speak the queen&rsquo;s English, you&rsquo;re okay, but if you&rsquo;re an island hoodlum, then there are no bounds to the expression of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This kind of race-inflected class conflict flared up in the early nineties, when thousands of partying black undergrads moved the traditional Fourth of July party from Virginia Beach (from which they had been ousted) to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard&rsquo;s South Beach. There were wild bacchanals full of public drunkenness, girls strolling around wearing very little, and guys ogling them with camcorders glued to their eyes or snakes wrapped around their necks. &#8220;Those parties were loud and raucous and not the typical Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard crowd at all,&#8221; remembers one longtime black Vineyarder. &#8220;It was a different sort of person coming  &mdash;  the difference between Ebony and Jet, or between Marvin Gaye and Biggie.&#8221; To the Only Ones, the influx of hip-hop-blasting, beer-guzzling blacks felt like an invasion. As another person remembers it: &#8220;People had more grills in their mouth than their ride, and it blew up the island.&#8221;</p>
<p>A series of community meetings were convened. &#8220;No one said &#8216;Where all these loud niggers coming from?&rsquo; But that was the vibe from black and white Vineyarders.&#8221; In 1997, a solution was implemented that was simple and subtle enough to fix the problem while avoiding charges of racism: The ferry from Woods Hole changed its policy to eliminate standby passengers and to make reservations nontransferable. Party promoters could no longer buy tickets in bulk, and most students wouldn&rsquo;t think to make a reservation months ahead of time. The parties moved elsewhere, and the Vineyard went back to business as usual.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not running from &#8216;their own&rsquo;? Of course they&rsquo;re not. That would an act of &#8216;hate&rsquo;. The SPLC should investigate this heinous segregation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the standard of &#8216;the best&rsquo; is always white for blacks.</p>

		<p> The only person identified specifically as White in the whole article refers to himself as a &#8220;bald, white honky.&#8221; A case of White self-hatred, perhaps? Any more, that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re programmed in school.</p>
<p> And notice that the article at one place quotes someone   &mdash;   black, of course   &mdash;   as using the dreaded, horrifying &#8220;n-word,&#8221; which we&rsquo;re not even allowed to utter on here. Guess it&rsquo;s OK if a black says it, huh?</p>
<p> And isn&rsquo;t it interesting that even upper-class blacks themselves find the loud, disruptive, let-it-all-hang-out ghetto types repugnant if they have to be around large groups of them. Too vivid a reminder of where the &#8220;n-word&#8221; originated, perhaps? </p>

<p>The Kennedy White liberals and these elitist rich Blacks who don&rsquo;t want to associate with Whites, non rich Blacks - these folks need, NEED to experience forced integration. </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t we all like to see Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard look, smell and feel like East St. Louis?</p>
<p>After we integrate (destroy) Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, we can go on to doing the same thing about Bush family retreats in Maine.</p>

<p>So, the elites prefer to be among their own kind, both black and white, but they require the lower classes to integrate professionally, socially, and during any kind of schooling or training.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re so brilliant they have to tell us what we should do, because only THEY have the wisdom to oversee everything we do and say.</p>
<p>Yes, the far left radicals have their useful idiots.  I wonder if these white types could be called our useless idiots?  <br>

<p>Anyone else catch this? &#8220;Toure&#8221; seems to imply that these racist white comapnies have a limit to the amount of blacks they will hire. In fact, they bend over backwards to let in lesser qualified (or non-qualified) blacks.</p>
<p>Personally, I say &#8220;god bless &#8216;em.&#8221; But they still come running for whitey when they are looking jobs, houses, schools or hospitals.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard and all the locals are white (at least in 1996 they were). Would love to talk to a local waitress, cleaner or laborer about all the abuse they have to take from racist black tourists looking to humiliate a white worker.</p>
<p>White and Hispanic waitresses can talk for hours about the abuse they take at the hands of black customers.</p>

		<p>This man has been going ot Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard since 1954? How old is he? </p>
<p>I beleive that this might be the case for the older Whites and Blacks, especially the over 45/50 yar old crowd who tend to be racist or at the very least, racially conscious by nature, but when I vacation in the Hamptons, I tend to see a considerable amount of integration among the younger, hip more afluent crowd at nightclubs, bars theates etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the blacks for thinking like this.  I am white and think the exact same way.  I don&rsquo;t want or need black people around me.  In fact, there are days when I wake up and drive and until I see a black person and realize they are my enemy, until that time, life is beautiful.  If the blacks and whites could segregate and live separate but equal then we would all be happier.  Instead they prey upon us, we have no choice but to hate them and our boleshevik masters for screwing our world up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They aren&rsquo;t assimilationist; they&rsquo;re ascensionist&#8221;. </p>
<p>There, in a nutshell, is why Bantus from the mother continent, infest non-Bantu countries. They don&rsquo;t want to be a part of the nation they migrate to; they want to attach themselves to it, much like a leech or lamprey, and suck out as much as they can from the host. Whether it&rsquo;s America, Canada, Britain, France, Russia, Japan or Holland.</p>
<p>Bantus will NEVER, EVER assimilate, despite all the pious pronouncements, legislation enacted and money spent. It&rsquo;s just not their way. We at Amren recognize it, but the rest of this country never will, even if you took Thor&rsquo;s hammer and pounded them over the head with it. </p>

<p>I was thinkin g the sme thing when I read this post. The man in question has been going to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard since 1954! That was 55 years ago! He must be in his 70s by now! Hell, the guy probably knows nothing but segregation like most Americans of his generation. </p>
<p>Secondly, as someone who has vacationed on the vineyard  with friends of various races, I have see a number of interracial couples, and younger people like you mentioned, who do socialize with one another, bar hop, share cottages etc&hellip; I have also seen the same at the Hamptons (the  New Hampshire beach, not upstate New Yor, but as you mentioned, the same baehavior akes palce there as well. It is a fun night spot. I used to go there alot in the 1990s.</p>
<p>This guy and some of his peers seem to have chips on thier shoulder and are he products of a old America that they still cannot get past. </p>

		<p>As one of those upscale Black people who has vactioned at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard for decades, I am 61, I am very skeptical of this article. In fact, there are a number of people Black and White who have posted on the Atlantic Monthly website contesting the accuracy of this piece. The entire piece is on this website. </p>
<p>In fact, there are a number of Blacks and Whites who have always socialized with one another for decades. This is particularly true of the younger people. In fact, in the 1960s, my parents, both who died two years ago, six months apart, often hosted perties where people of both races,including some White europeans and African nationalists attended. In fact, people took turns hosting parties. They becamre a litle mundane overtime, but the point that I am attempting to illustrate is that there was considerable interracial interaction that took place.  </p>
<p>I also found out that the author Toure is a person who has had a questionable, troubled reputation with women and with people in general. He was fired from several magazines for various reasons. </p>
<p>While the quote does not appear in the condensed article above, I know for a fact that no respecting upscale Black person in the vineyard would refer Michelle Obama as a &#8220;ghetto girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>This author seems to have an agenda.  </p>

		<p>This is what is most maddening. The &#8220;Only Ones&#8221; of the Vineyard no more want to be around the street bruthas than your average, sane, non self hating White. And they make no bones about it. The language they use in describing the street bruthas would get the average White fired and probably sued. But let any White voice his concern or dismay about the conduct of these thug&rsquo;s and most if not all of the &#8220;Only Ones&#8221; will leap right to the defense of the thug&rsquo;s. This circling of the wagon&rsquo;s in defense of these low life&rsquo;s from criticism by White&rsquo;s is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>The views expressed in this news article are Proof Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard need desegregated post-haste. As for the black blue-bloods needing to associate with rank and file blacks too&hellip; all we need to do is circulate enough copies of AmRen there, and the rich blacks will feel so guilty they&rsquo;ll invite these hip-hop blacks back without question. Right to the back lawn. Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a richer bunch of people. And nothing like killing two birds with one stone.</p>

To: Black Person Who Vacations on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that both experiences are valid.</p>
<p>I can see a group of whites and blacks coming together and trying to form a bond. But as you said, over time, the meetings became less significant. The reason is that these types of groups are forced and artificial. On some level, it&rsquo;s requires effort to get along with people who are different. Over time, people naturally associate with people of their own race and background because it&rsquo;s simply easier.</p>
<p>While you may not have associated with the people in this piece, they represent all the black people who do whatever they can to not be around black folk. Spike Lee can likely afford to live anywhere. While he makes movies about &#8216;the black experience&rsquo;, where does he live? That tells me all I need to known. Mr. Lee is a race exploiting hypocrite who makes money by playing to black paranoia and stereotypes. He essentially feeds blacks what they want. They eat it up and he goes to live with the white folk. Instead of calling him out for it, blacks thinks he&rsquo;s a great brother fightin&rsquo; for the cause. The only think Mr. Lee is fighting for is to get away from the blacks who go to his films.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old America?&#8221;  &#8220;Chips on their shoulders?&#8221; Maybe it is you who lacks the proper perspective of the real world, old guy, and are engaged in wishful thinking rather than reality.  And, anybody who thinks it is whites of any age who can&rsquo;t &#8220;get past&#8221; a certain way of thinking is delusional and sees the world through the distorted lens of bigotry, especially since the majority of blacks resent whites and are insanely jealous of them, because of their own inabilities and mental shortcomings. It is VERY rare to encounter a black who does not have a chip on his shoulder, almost always because he can&rsquo;t advance due to his inability, but blames white oppression and racism for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They became a litle mundane overtime, but the point that I am attempting to illustrate is that there was considerable interracial interaction that took place. In fact, there are a number of Blacks and Whites who have always socialized with one another for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you hold the view that there were always a &#8220;number of blacks and whites who have always socialized with one another for decades,&#8221; then you have to understand that you&rsquo;re a minority of people who hold that opinion.  While there has to be some who socialize today, I seriously doubt what you&rsquo;re claiming is true and could well be considered delusional.  Most people can&rsquo;t stand being around blacks because of their rude, loud behavior, and their lack of any real intellect, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>&#8216;While the quote does not appear in the condensed article above, I know for a fact that no respecting upscale Black person in the vineyard would refer Michelle Obama as a &ldquo;ghetto girl.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re right on that score, and I doubt there would be any whites who would consider her in that light either; however, in reading her college thesis it&rsquo;s very apparent to me that she has a &#8220;racial&#8221; ghetto mentality that is totally fixated on race and is quite eager to see racism when none exists, except for what she espouses.  She seems to be blind to the fact that she wouldn&rsquo;t have a degree at all if it weren&rsquo;t for AA grading, entry preference, and certification.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be within a 100 miles of her or any other black like her, because I just can&rsquo;t stand to listen to the unjust whining anymore.  </p>
<p>Blacks, as a group, can&rsquo;t compete in an advanced society, and, like Michelle Obama, they would be working at best as clerks somewhere if they had to rely on ability rather than affirmative action.</p>
<p>And, I&rsquo;m really, really tired of pretending otherwise. Sorry, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>

		<p>Better yet, a Section-8 style vacation rental program should be established for Martha&rsquo;s Vinyard where thousands of disadvantaged and dispossessed African-American children can be set up at oceanside cottages for the summer.  Yes we can!</p>

		<p>I vacationed at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard for several years in the 1990&rsquo;s. It is a really beautiful and scenic place. I saw extremely few blacks whenever I was there. There IS an American Indian tribe on the island. They were always blocking some road or something in their corner of the island. They always seemed to have some grievance or another. But I saw very, very few blacks there. I know Spike Lee has a place there. I always thought it peculiar that such an in your face black militant would have such an overwhelmingly White (or at least non-Black) place as his choice for a vacation home.</p>

		<p>I have said it before and will say it again because it&rsquo;s worth repeating.</p>
<p>the Family, the matrix of society, is falling apart, and we&rsquo;re obsessing over race relations.  As if our failure in one is going to solve our problems in the other.</p>
<p>Also&hellip;</p>
<p>News Flash.</p>
<p>Integration is NOT important.</p>
<p>Why do we talk about it as if it were without EVER explaining WHY it is so damned important?</p>
<p>Same reason we talked about Sex in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s and even now.<br>
Fact is, except for reproduction Sex is NOT that important.  <br>
It simply is not that important.</p>
<p>So then, what&rsquo;s the catch?</p>
<p>Well, that it has been GIVEN importance because SOME people think it is. Namely, people with access to the tools of propaganda and publicity.  They THINK it&rsquo;s important, so they GIVE it importance. </p>
<p>NOTHING MORE!</p>
<p>It takes the puniest amount of introspection to see that things that have been shoved down our throats, like everything from Sex to Integration, etc. are nothing compared to the importance of food, clothing, shelther, and healing.<br>
Healing from what?<br>
From the stress and strain of beling alive in a complex world filled with people who force us to walk THEIR talk.<br>
You can heal by reading, meditating, having an activity or two, making friends, being polite, doing a kind act without broadcasting it to the world (good advice for the Brangalina&rsquo;s of the world), or just going for a walk.<br>
But you don&rsquo;t have shag girls or sing We Are The World with people from other Races.  It is simply NOT that important.  It&rsquo;s been GIVEN importance.  That&rsquo;s all. </p>

		<p>There was a book written by author/Journalist Jill Nelson that discusses Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard and her summers there as a young girl with her parents (her fathers was a prominent New York City dentist) and siblings and how she and her siblings still vacation together at the cottage that their parents had purchased in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>In one of her Chapters, she discussed the fact that Blacks and Whites did indeed mingle with one another on the vineyad, that she herself had several White girlfriends and her parents had a number of Black and White friends as well.</p>

		<p>The easiest way to remedy the apparent Segregation between the White Liberal Hypocrites, and those Black &#8220;Professionals&#8221; that are all Affirmative Action recipiants is to visit your local Homeless Shelter or &#8220;Ethnic&#8221; Neighborhood, and offer at least one ticket, one way, to these poor inner City Blacks to visit Martha&rsquo;s Vinyard, by way of Greyhound, or Trailways Motor Coach. </p>
<p>I would love to see their Liberal faces when these Busses pulled into the Station. </p>

		<p>The point is not that a black person and a white person cannot sit down and have a coffee or cocktail like decent human beings (of course they can). The point is that blacks and whites both have a sense of who they are and separation from each other, even in the most &#8220;liberal&#8221; settings. </p>
<p>For many blacks, the most pressing concern is finding out if they can individually achieve as much as whites and mingle in upscale places like Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. The answer is yes, there are plenty of bright and high achieving blacks out there. But where does that bring us? Nowhere, really. </p>
<p>Friendship is great, but when people return to their own color in marriage and childbirth, then the reality is separation. Which brings us to the question, if blacks and whites are as persistent in their choices to remain separate as they seem to be even in very liberal climates, what does this mean for our futures? </p>
<p>Forever separate but living and mingling with each other? Is that really compatible with human nature? </p>
