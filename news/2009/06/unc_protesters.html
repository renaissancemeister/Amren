<h1>UNC Protesters Reject Plea Deals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James Deconto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), June 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Charges against seven campus protesters will be heard in September after one had her case continued and the others rejected plea agreements Monday.</p>
<p>Haley Koch, a Morehead-Cain scholar at UNC-Chapel Hill, faces a charge of disturbing the peace at a protest against former Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s speech April 14.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her case and those of six other protesters in a second campus incident now will be heard Sept. 14.</p>
<p>The other defendants protested at an April 22 speech by former U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode of Virginia, who also favors stricter immigration policies.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Jeff Nieman offered to dismiss the charges of five of the six Goode defendants after six months if they stayed off the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, committed no other crimes, performed 24 hours of community service and paid a $200 community service fee.</p>
<p>That &#8220;deferred prosecution&#8221; arrangement would have required them to admit guilt, which the protesters rejected.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the defendants feel that they&rsquo;re not guilty, and so taking a plea would be dishonest,&#8221; said Michael Bandes, 25, who spoke on behalf of the group.</p>
<p>Bandes had a prior criminal record and was offered a plea agreement that would have required him paying a $100 fine plus court costs. He rejected that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important not to just let the university get this over with quickly and win,&#8221; said Bandes. &#8220;Just because you own this town doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just do whatever you want here.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re allowing a white supremacist group in our community, and we&rsquo;re just supposed to sit down and take it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koch spoke at a rally in front of the courthouse after Monday&rsquo;s hearing. So did her father, award-winning filmmaker Chris Koch, who has observed peaceful anti-war and pro-civil rights demonstrations over the years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koch&rsquo;s mother, Susan, was also there, along with family friend Hodding Carter, who was White House press secretary under President Jimmy Carter and now teaches at UNC-CH.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The UNC Protesters Defense Committee, which organized the rally, called on Thorp to dissolve Youth for Western Civilization. Haley Koch said allowing speech against immigrants would fuel donations and membership for more violent groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;A culture of hate breeds a culture of violence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t about people just saying things. This is about people who hope to perpetrate violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Sort of like the hate Koch felt for those with different views and the aggression she and her comrades perpetrated.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I would do if I were in a position of authority relevant to the subject matter:</p>
<p>Huff and puff and scare them to death.  Then promise to let them go if they rat out the professor(s) that put them up to it.  Then bring mob/RICO or something against the professors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d see this left wing kook and nut shows stop all across the country by yesterday.</p>

<p>Good!</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get a conviction on record so they&rsquo;ll have a criminal file that will haunt them for the rest of their lives, misdemeanor or not, disturbing the peace still looks shabby on a person&rsquo;s record.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hispanics and that one egyptian girl should be informed that they&rsquo;re currently members of a white supremacist group.  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be quite shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haley Koch said allowing speech against immigrants would fuel donations and membership for more violent groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: We can&rsquo;t let other students listen to the YWC and their speakers, otherwise they might agree with them!</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;A culture of hate breeds a culture of violence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about people just saying things. This is about people who hope to perpetrate violence.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Last time I checked, the protesters were the ones hurling things through the windows of people they disagreed with - not the YWC.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A culture of hate breeds a culture of violence&#8221;. Why don&rsquo;t you ask Eve Carson how she feels about your stupidity.Oh thats right . She was klled by the people you support. Look out for your own people or die like the rest. The Youth for Western Civilization might be the guys who pull a black criminal off of you one day .I hope not</p>

		<p>Hoding Cater was a memeber of the Carter adminstration. The Carter adminstration opened the floodgates of LEGAL asian IMMIGRATION. At the time there was very high unemployment of Native Born White Engineers.Thousands of Native Born White American males engineers had already been replaced with LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians. They were forced to compete with these LEGAL IMMIGRANT scab asian workers for engineers. Carter was a traitor for doing this. In doing this, Carter inflicted great harm upon thousands of Native Born White families.</p>
<p>Koch and her parents are more than just traitors. They harbor genocidal intent towards the majority Native Born White American population. They are thoroughly disagusting and evil creatures.</p>

		<p>Someday, if I have a lot of money, I&rsquo;d love to set up a grant program for community service works. It could be any time of project, but there would be one special requirement: the recipient of the grant could not be a college graduate or college student. With no professors pushing their agendas and no feel-good projects that did nobody any good, I think that I&rsquo;d get a lot of really good, common sense grant proposals. I&rsquo;m starting to think that even trying with college students is a lost cause.  </p>

		<p>The plea deal was a deferred prosecution, which means it would not have been on their permanent records if they successfully completed the probationary period.  I&rsquo;d have jumped on a deal like that!  The 24 hours of community service would have meant nothing more odius than folding clothes and stocking shelves at a local Arc or Goodwill thrift store.</p>
<p>What these dopes don&rsquo;t appear to understand is that in order to receive a jury trial for a misdemeanor in Colorado, the defendant must pay the costs of the jury.  What they&rsquo;re going to get instead is a court trial, in which the judge will determine guilt.  I only hope they&rsquo;re disruptive in court, because the judge will put them in their place by holding them in contempt and having the bailiff&rsquo;s handcuff them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before; a liberal is someone who imagines a world he or she would like to live in, and then childishly pretends they actually live in such a world.</p>

		<p>This is just liberal punks getting their &#8220;Street cred&#8221; I saw the same thing at vietnam rallies&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t fight for their country so they spent a few hours in junior jail before Mommy bailed them &hellip; and bragged for the rest of their lives that they made a difference while living out their rich kid liberal fantasies.  Been there done that.</p>
