<h1>BNP Goes to Strasbourg</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Webster, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>British politics changed dramatically on June 4 as British voters, sickened by the corruption of the governing Labour Party and reluctant to embrace the opposition Tories, pinned their hopes on smaller parties. Among the big winners was the British National Party (BNP), which broke through into serious politics by winning two seats in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>When ballots were counted three days after the vote, the first BNP victory to be announced was that of long-time nationalist activist, Andrew Brons, who won a seat in the Yorkshire and Humber region of North East England with 9.8 percent of the vote. Hours later, the British political and media establishment reacted with even greater dismay to the news that BNP leader Nick Griffin had won a second seat for the BNP in the North West region with 8 percent. (The Euro-elections are run by proportional representation. Voters vote for parties, not individual candidates, and seats are distributed accordingly.) It was a historic achievement. No British nationalist political party had ever won a parliamentary seat of any kind, and now the BNP holds two, just as BNP spokesmen were predicting.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s victory is particularly satisfying, given the media vilification he suffered during the campaign. The press did not even try to hide its bias, routinely smearing him as a &#8220;fascist&#8221; and a &#8220;racist.&#8221; On election day the tabloid newspaper <cite>Daily Sun</cite> ran a large bright orange banner ad that blared, &#8220;Stop Nick Griffin,&#8221; with a link to an anti-BNP website run by the far-left, anti-white organization Searchlight.</p>
<p>On election night, a violent crowd of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; agitators tried to prevent Mr. Griffin from attending the vote count at the Manchester town hall, surrounding his car and pelting it with eggs as they screamed, &#8220;Fascist scum.&#8221; He had to give up his car and ride to the town hall in a police van.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin won by the thinnest margin, and it was 2 a.m. before officials were able to announce the result. When the BNP leader finally took the stage at Manchester town hall the other newly elected Euro-MPs walked off in protest. Undeterred, Mr. Griffin told the crowd that BNP success would &#8220;transform British politics.&#8221; Of his election, he said, &#8220;This is ordinary decent people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. kicking back against racism, because racism in this country is now directed overwhelmingly against people who look like me.&#8221; He added: &#8220;We&rsquo;re here to look after our people because no one else will. For the last 50 years, more and more of the people of Britain have watched with concern, growing dismay, and sometimes anger as an out-of-touch political elite has transformed our country before our very eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The establishment politicians reacted with typical contempt for the electorate. Sir Robert Atkins, the head of the Conservative Party list in the North West (see last month&rsquo;s article on the BNP for how the Euro-elections are run), described the BNP as &#8220;an aberration&#8221; and called Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s success a &#8220;sad day for British politics.&#8221; Arlene McCarthy, who headed the Labour list, told the crowd the BNP was &#8220;a party whose members include convicted rapists.&#8221; BNP supporters replied with, &#8220;Get back to the trough!&#8221; a reference to the continuing UK parliament expenses scandal, which has undermined support for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>At the vote count in Yorkshire, the BNP&rsquo;s first Euro-MP Andrew Brons denounced the &#8220;onslaught against us&#8221; by the media and other parties. &#8220;Despite the lies, despite the money, despite the misrepresentation, we&rsquo;ve been able to win through,&#8221; he said. The dapper and articulate Mr. Brons had been teaching politics and government at Harrogate College before reentering politics under the BNP banner.</p>
<p>Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown will face further pressure to resign after the BNP breakthrough and his own party&rsquo;s meager showing in the Euro-elections. Says one unnamed senior party leader, &#8220;It is one thing to lose to the Tories, but actually to do so badly that we are letting in the fascists is quite another.&#8221; Health Secretary Andy Burnham agreed: &#8220;It is a sad moment. There are concerns about immigration. The Government have to get a response to those concerns. We have got to understand why people have voted for the BNP. We should redouble our determination to take them on and take them out of British politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the results were overshadowed by the Euro-Parliament campaign, the BNP also broke through in county council elections held the same day, winning a seat each in Lancashire, Leicestershire, and Hertfordshire. In addition to these three seats, the BNP now has 55 town councilors and 50 borough and other local councilors. Mr. Griffin wants to make the BNP a mainstream political party, and these victories will go a long way towards achieving that goal. The party will now get government funding, which will help it contest future elections and make it harder for the media to dismiss the BNP as a fringe party and ignore its positions.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin and Mr. Brons are likely to play an important role in any parliamentary group formed by European nationalists. Nationalists did well all across Europe as support for the left collapsed on the continent as it did in Britain. In Austria, the Freedom Party won 13 percent of the vote and will send two members to the European Parliament. In Denmark, Pia Kjaersgaard&rsquo;s Danish People&rsquo;s Party won 14.4 percent and will send two members.</p>
<p>Renegade Dutch politician Geert Wilder&rsquo;s Freedom Party stunned the establishment by winning 17 percent of the vote and coming in just behind the ruling Christian Democrats. In Hungary, a new party called the Movement for a Better Hungary, which campaigns on the slogan &#8220;Hungary belongs to the Hungarians,&#8221; was the third-place finisher with 15 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>An exception to the encouraging record was the National Front in France, which saw its percentage of the vote drop from 9.8 percent in 2004 to 6.3 percent, with the result that it is sending only three Euro-MPs to Strasbourg. Martin Schulz, leader of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Socialist bloc, summed up the feelings of the left: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a sad evening for social democracy in Europe. We are particularly disappointed. It&rsquo;s a bitter evening for us.&#8221;<br>

Let me be the first   &mdash;   no, probably more like the 5000th   &mdash;   person to congratulate Mssrs. Griffin and Brons on their BNP&rsquo;s splendid showing in the EUros! </p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m in America, I subscribe to BNP e-mails   &mdash;   and when the &#8220;VICTORY!&#8221; message from Nick Griffin came thru last night (Sun), I knew that the British National Party had finally come in from the cold. This is the best D-Day the Brits have had in over 60 years!  <br>
 <br>
Only a few years ago, Nick Griffin was sent to prison for Hatespeech. Now he&rsquo;s going to Brussels as one of the BNP&rsquo;s first two MEPs ever. That makes Mr. Griffin the white race&rsquo;s Nelson Mandela. </p>
<p>Right-wing Americans, take note: THIS is how you run a successful, unapologetic, ethnically aware &#8220;third party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have a look for yourself: <br>

		<p>&ldquo;No British nationalist political party had ever won a parliamentary seat of any kind, and now the BNP holds two, just as BNP spokesmen were predicting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, in a very long time, politics is exciting me to near rapture. The disgusting displays of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; by the far-left, and the equally &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; actions by the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; Euro-political hacks, only makes this victory for whites in the UK all the more sweet. I am convinced that our viciously treasonous opposition the whole world over, the so-called: &ldquo;enlightened,&rdquo; &ldquo;educated,&rdquo; &ldquo;cosmopolitan,&rdquo; and above all &ldquo;forbearing,&rdquo; are little better than rabid animals. They rant about &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and rave about &ldquo;hate,&rdquo; when every action that they indulge in is an essay on the topics when applied to whites; they openly work for our genocide, and have the unmitigated gall to claim the reverse is true about our movement and people.</p>
<p>A hideously laughable example from above, is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arlene McCarthy, who headed the Labour list, told the crowd the BNP was &lsquo;a party whose members include convicted rapists.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would be unlike Labour and all the other &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; entities in the UK and Europe, which have never met a nonwhite rapist of white women that they didn&rsquo;t either applaud or cover up for, and hand out voter registrations to as well! That is simply Sexually Transmitted Cultural Enrichment for white women in their eyes. That includes even when it happens to themselves personally, or to one of their fellow Reds. These people (and I use the term very loosely here,) are beneath even being beneath contempt. </p>
<p>Congratulations to Mr. Griffin, Mr. Brons, and the rest of the European Nationalists; I hope they really give all the malignant EU and UK fools, something to cry about endlessly!!!<br>

		<p>I see that David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, called it  a &ldquo;day of shame&rdquo; for Britain.  And the press freely expressed their displeasure and gloom over the results. The media are clearly anything but neutral in Britain!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it a shame that the people spoke (but didn&rsquo;t say what they were supposed to)?   How awful!   How dare they go against their programing! Some nerve. Well the system will have be &#8220;fixed&#8221; a bit that&rsquo;s all. Something went wrong this time. Can&rsquo;t let it happen again.</p>
<p>What does this tell us about media&rsquo;s/establishment&rsquo;s respect for the democratic procedure? Their contempt for the people&rsquo;s will?</p>
<p>Already they&rsquo;re talking about ways to re-adjust the way votes are counted. To do it by &#8220;groupings&#8221;.  Outrageous!  If they can&rsquo;t rig it one way, they&rsquo;ll rig it another. Do these people have no ethics at all?  In another setting, they would be considered gangsters, plain and simple.</p>

		<p>How strange, the same papers that universally heralded Obama&rsquo;s election as &#8220;historic&#8221; are not doing the same in this election. One might be tempted to conclude that they&rsquo;re biased!  </p>
<p>CNN and other news outlets are already hard at work explaining away the right&rsquo;s relative victory as a sort of statistical snafu resulting from low voter turnout. </p>
<p>Yet CNN pegs voter turnout at 43%, which is not particularly low if compared to, say, the 2000 US presidential elections, with 51% voter turnout. </p>
<p>Congratulations to the BNP and Nick Griffin for giving public voice to those sentiments that needed so badly to be heard.</p>

		<p>These victories will mean that Griffin, Andrew Brons, who won the other BNP seat, and the BNP itself will receive £4 million ($6.3 million at today&rsquo;s exchange rates) of EP salaries, expense accounts, and public financing for the BNP in aggregate per year over the next several years.</p>
<p>Daily Mail, Tory Party propgaandist that it is, dismisses BNP wins as a &ldquo;protest vote&rdquo; against Labor and Gordon Brown.  This is a common canard trucked out by the lamestream media and body politic every time a right winger wins.  This was their reaction when Pat Buchanan either won or showed strong seconds in Republican primaries when he ran for President as a Republican in 1992 and 1996.  (His 2000 run was on the Reform Party.)  The trouble is, almost every British party save Labor gained votes.  Why aren&rsquo;t those protest votes against Labor and its PM?  Hell, the GREEN PARTY doubled its MEP take compared to four years ago, and that&rsquo;s not a protest vote?  Actually, that is, I guess that its gain could be explained by white left-wing voters who figured the Labor party as hopeless in these elections.  Even the UKIP, an aracial Euroskeptic party, finished ahead of Labor.  As it is, I think the British media pumped up the UKIP to preempt the BNP.  If not for that, the BNP might have won a lot more seats.  But the scheme didn&rsquo;t preclude them from winning seats, thankfully.</p>
<p>CofCC.org reports that the Tories, Labor and LibDems combined spent more money and resources to hate on the BNP than they did for their own parties.</p>

<p>Plain and simple. People have voted for the BNP because the English are on the verge of losing England. That&rsquo;s incomprehensible. Why would any English individual want to give up their country to foreigner&rsquo;s, for the sake of not wanting to appear &#8220;racist&#8221;? Who do you care about more, immigrants that care nothing about you or your own family? At least there appears to be some awakening in Britain. I don&rsquo;t know about America. Too many white Americans are complacent and are lulled by the media, by the big &#8220;group hug&#8221;, the big melting pot. WRONG. They can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t acknowledge that they are slowly being smothered out of existence. I love who I am and I love my family. Enough is enough!</p>

		<p>Although it impressive to see an immigration reduction party breakthrough like the BNP did, there is another party in Britain that agrees completely with a moratorium on immigration and pulling out of the EU without the baggage of the BNP - The UK Independence Party.  If I were British I would vote for the UKIP because the BNP takes lots of positions like trade protectionism and defending state monopoly health care that I can&rsquo;t really support.  The UKIP focuses its energy on pulling out of the EU and stopping immigration while avoiding endorsing policies that will divide its supporters.  This is similar to American Renaissance actually.  I think that is sometimes part of the problem with the National Front in France.  It is too often to the left of Sarkozy&rsquo;s party on economics that it turns off some potential conservative supporters.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a good showing by the right-wing and I&rsquo;m glad for it.  Hopefully this will reverberate back in the US.  But I see a long, tumultuous, struggle ahead as the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parties unite to stymie these new parties.  They seem to have been successful, at least temporarily, in France.</p>

		<p>MY HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS TO MR. GRIFFIN, BNP AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE FOR WAKING UP, FINALLY.</p>
<p>Congratulations!  This is a great day when the people have finally awakened.  The Destructionits and the libbarbarians in the media are shocked that British people do really want to save their nation, despite being conned and harassed by the libbarbarians.  Their hate speech shows their depravaity and decay that they cannot appreciate the victory of a patriotic and great party like the BNP.   </p>
<p>People must stop buying media products from such nutcases in the media; when the nutcases realize that people think of them as nutcases, sociopaths, fascists and libbarbarians for criticizing the BNP, and won&rsquo;t buy their junk, the mediocrats will shut up and go away.  </p>

		<p>They keep saying the BNP is far right and extreme right but the party sounds normal and reasonable to me. I think most Brits today agree with much of the platform and if we went back 50 or so years the party would have been accepted as mainstream. Perhaps we need to appreciate how much the center has shifed leftward. The immigration and multicult project to abolish the British nation is a program of the leftists. Using fuzzy and imprecise concepts like racism and fascism the left is decimating the British nation. British people have lived on their isles since the end of the ice age. In one or two generations the program is to annihilate them in a ethno-cultural genocide. It&rsquo;s here where the words far and extreme should be used. </p>

       No Libertarian type party will ever control immigration.<br>
People are just resources to them and they believe in the free<br>
flow of resources according to market principles. Mrs Thatcher<br>
once let out that she didn&rsquo;t reall believe in Society; it&rsquo;s all<br>
just individuals and their contracts. The Goverment becomes just<br>
the enforcer of these contracts. Needless to say, such a nebulous<br>
structure is easily torn down by any united people such as the<br>
Arabs, Turks, or Mexicans. Call it collective bargaining if you<br>
have nothing better in your vocabulary, but it&rsquo;s a fact. What&rsquo;s<br>

		<p>I had read about the Election results, as they were being made public, on the Council of Conservative Citizens&rsquo; web site, which is https://www.cofcc.org. </p>
<p>I was overjoyed with the report that the British National Party (BNP) had taken several City, and County Seats, and were awaiting further results, at that time, about the National results. </p>
<p>Likewise, the same News had been reported about the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Now, after a majority of the Election results are in, we can see a great shift in the local Seats obtained, and more Seats taken by Center-Right, and Right-Wing Nationalist Parties across Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, the Native White people of the many European Nations have awakened to their own plight, and the very real threat to their Culture, and National Identity.</p>
<p>Now, we must strive for greater gains, and then move to Deport all non-Whites from Europe. </p>

		<p>The BNP is supported by many people. Just think how many votes they would have got if they had stood for every seat.</p>
<p>For Cameron to describe their supporters as &#8220;&hellip;&hellip;. an appalling bunch of people&#8221; just shows the distain that the political elite have for ordinary working class white people who&rsquo;s wishes and concerns have been ignored for decades whilst mass immigration and multiculturalism has been imposed with no democrtic mandate. When they do complain they are shouted down, marginalised, called racist and threatened with arrest.</p>
<p>So much for the rights of indiginous peoples and free speech.</p>
<p>Now we see the consequences - not in the success of the BNP but in the crime, terrorism, disease and discrimination against the indiginous population that has been a consequence of successive governments policies.</p>
<p>I wish the BNP well. They are the only people who care for the native people, their culture and right to exist. </p>
<p>Maybe, if we can get the message out that the Labour Party our fathers and grandfathers fought for has been hijacked by minorities, gays and middle class marxists, we can lose them the working class vote entirely and take on the role of their defenders because Labour certainly isn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>The media are making much of the fact that the BNP polled fewer votes than it did in 2004.<br>
However, in my 57 years I have never seen a political party subjected to such lies, cheap abuse and pure invention. The BNP has largely depended on the web to get its message across, having been starved of the opportunity to debate its message through the traditional media.<br>
With two MEPs, new credibility, additional cash and perhaps new members, hopefully it will be harder for the establishment to do this in future.<br>

  Well, let&rsquo;s see how free trade has &#8216;benefitted&rsquo; America over the past decades - yoour nation is in the absurd and tragi-comic situation of being in massive debt to the Chinese and Japanese, whilst simulataneously borrowing further huge sums of money from the aforementioned east Asians in order to buy more east Asian goods in order to get yourselves even further into debt - Good Dod, what an intelligent policy! - The current economic meltdown is a mere symptom of this absurdity that has been allowed to run too long, manly because people like you think it is &#8216;clever&rsquo; to persist wuth this madness, and oh, by the way real incomes of average Americans are *lower* now than in 1968.<br>
    Secondly, although Britain&rsquo;s NHS has many, many faults I read recently that the costs of healthcare to treat chronic conditions are the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy in the USA.</p>

		<p>White Detroiter, the UKIP is an establishment safety-valve, contrived by the mainstream parties to take the sting out of nationalist sentiment. Like the English Democrats, it is a spoiler party, whose sole purpose is to limit the amount of support for the BNP by splitting the nationalist/Eurosceptic vote.</p>
<p>And why should the indigenous working class and lower-middle class of Britain (especially England) wish to vote for a party whose right-wing, free-market economic policies benefit the super-rich and the multinational corporations while leaving those less fortunate in a state of permanent economic anxiety and disadvantage? The immigrants are relatively unscathed by such policies since in relative terms (to their countries of origin) they are rich beyond their wildest dreams, whether sleeping 20 to a room and working for well below the official minimum wage, snapping up secure and well-paid jobs in the public sector (such as the NHS and the DSS) or enjoying the taxpayers&rsquo; largesse in the form of state benefits vastly more generous than those ever made available to the indigenous population.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a damn if a few well-heeled &#8220;conservatives&#8221;, who personally do very well out of the present economic dispensation, are alienated, if the pursuit of genuinely public-spirited economics benefits a broader swathe of the indigenous population. Go BNP!</p>

		<p> While I&rsquo;m delighted by these victories, I&rsquo;m afraid the Fourth Estate will continue to use Nick Griffin&rsquo;s past against him. It is unfortunate that many of the right wing parties seem to coalesce around one charismatic leader. I think the BNP and Freedom Party need to really concentrate on expanding their leadership. In this way the party is not so dependent on one individual. Nevertheless, this is a giant leap forward toward respectability. I remain more optimistic about Europe than the United States. Europe shows unmistakable signs of life, while the United States is already attracting flies. </p>

<p>Agreed. There is a great difference between respect for private property versus worship of greed and money for its own sake. Too many US &#8220;Republicans&#8221; fall into the latter category and call their socially bankrupt outlook &#8220;conservatism.&#8221; This is a major stumbling block for the Republicans. </p>

		<p>I am perhaps somewhat less supportive of the BNP than many of the racial realists on here. As an economic Libertarian, I don&rsquo;t like the fact that the BNP&rsquo;s economic policies are the same sort of socialist bollocks that Labour have forced on my (former) countrymen for over a decade. I take it as a bad sign that the BNP and Labour both think national healthcare and nationalized industry are good ideas, and I have no more faith in the BNP&rsquo;s ability to manage the economy than Labour. What I would like to see is Britain become far more Libertarian, much like the United States.</p>
<p>That being said, I do respect what the BNP has done and see it as an important step forward for racial-realist thinking in Britain. I welcome any vote which slaps the elitist establishment in the face, which is exactly what U.K. voters have just done. They must know that we aren&rsquo;t going to sit back and let them continue the Islamization of our countries that they&rsquo;ve encouraged, and that there will be consequences.</p>

Yes indeed,  I have noticed that.  They never fail to append those labels to anything slightly right of the extreme left. Anyone who is concerned with white rights or white survival is an &#8220;extremist&#8221;,  as if that&rsquo;s some outlandish idea deserving of contempt.</p>
<p>But yet, when it comes to cases of  black or immigrant crime,  these are the same media that absolutely NEVER would use a racially identifying term, if their lives depended on it!</p>
<p>Strange how they&rsquo;re so quick to slap labels on some people, yet so averse to use them on others!</p>
<p>Also - one more point - they (the media) are very respectful of whatever some groups of people want to be called. But only SOME people!   If blacks this year want to be known as &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;, and last year preferred to be &#8220;people of color&#8221;, etc., the media meekly follow along without a murmur.   They respect the principle that people are  allowed to choose their own self-designations.   But when it comes to  labels like &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;, &#8220;extreme right&#8221;,  &#8220;WASPS&#8221;, etc.,  they apply the terms however they see fit, no matter what your objections or how inaccurate (or offensive) they may be.  Even when you point out your objection, they persist in using the terminology anyway.  Evidently some people have more rights to self-designation than others!</p>

Although it impressive to see an immigration reduction party breakthrough like the BNP did, there is another party in Britain that agrees completely with a moratorium on immigration and pulling out of the EU without the baggage of the BNP - The UK Independence Party. If I were British I would vote for the UKIP because the BNP takes lots of positions like trade protectionism and defending state monopoly health care that I can&rsquo;t really support. The UKIP focuses its energy on pulling out of the EU and stopping immigration while avoiding endorsing policies that will divide its supporters. This is similar to American Renaissance actually. I think that is sometimes part of the problem with the National Front in France. It is too often to the left of Sarkozy&rsquo;s party on economics that it turns off some potential conservative supporters.(POST FROM &#8220;WHITE DETROITER&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;White Detroiter&#8221; I have to disagree with you. While I do like the UKIP There is nothing conservative with free trade and globalism. These two satanic beliefs have destroyed the White family. Protectionism is the key to any races survival.</p>

		<p>This was pure David triumphing over Goliath. Remember that the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) rules state that the BNP cannot be portrayed in a favourable light, and on top of all that they are allowed no right of reply. So this remarkable performance was achieved through the Internet and talking to the public on the streets. I still don&rsquo;t trust the lying mainstream media and believe they will deliberately saturate Nick &amp; Andrew with interviews until an innocent comment is made that can be distorted &amp; edited for the whole country to see, repeatedly. The BNP must be careful to whom they give interviews to. The media&rsquo;s bigoted attitude against the BNP will only intensify. </p>
<p>A prime example was the female presenter on BBC&rsquo;s election coverage Sunday evening, who, after commenting on the BNP, slipped-in footage of the uniformed nationalist Jobbik party in Hungary marching in to the election count &amp; incredibly, identifying them as the &#8221;anti-gypsy party&#8221;, craftily sending the subliminal message that the BNP too are racists &amp; fascists. It is clear naked racism by the presenter to identify elected representatives of the people of Hungary in this completely bigoted fashion &amp; demonstrates that these paid media lackeys can never be trusted by the British people. Buy no BBC licence, no newspapers, no TV subscriptions. Then watch their corrupt media empires collapse. <br>

In France, Sarkozy talked tough, syphoning votes away from National Front but once in office didn&rsquo;t really back up his talk.

<p>Ditto, in New Zealand with the demise of the populist/immigration restrictionist NZ First Party. I don&rsquo;t think this is problem with the BNP though as it is carefully developing a strong activist base and solid party finances.</p>
<p>The NZ First Party was heavily attacked by the main party for being sloppy and amateurish with its party finances, and the voting public has now lost confidence in it.</p>
<p>It was also a parliamentary party, formed from a few rebel MPs and so had no real activist base.</p>
<p>These kinds of parties do well for a while, as they get a lot of instant publicity, but after a while they tend to suffer from corruption or infighting. The same kinds of problems occurred with One Nation in Australia.<br>

<p>This reminds me of when Prop 13 passed in California.  The msm, academia, and politicians, including then-governor jerry brown (before he flip-flopped) fought tooth and nail against Prop 13.  It was OK with them that property taxes were skyrocketing every year and homeowners, especially the elderly on fixed incomes, were being taxed out of their homes.  No one spoke up for us until Howard Jarvis said &#8216;Enough!&rsquo; and organized a grassroots &#8216;peasants&rsquo; revolt.</p>
<p>Of course, Jarvis was thoroughly vilified statewide by the so-called intelligentsia and portrayed as a crotchety, senile old fool.  When Prop 13 passed, we kulaks were threatened with armageddon by the government and msm (which didn&rsquo;t happen) and told we were too stupid to know what we were voting for.</p>
<p>Recently, California had another peasant&rsquo;s revolt with the failures of Props 1a-c and we are being told again to expect statewide armageddon.  Governor Schwarzenneger proclaimed that the voters were tired of all the elections and that&rsquo;s why the props failed.  Assembly Speaker bass said the voter &#8216;were confused&rsquo; about the ballot measures and that they didn&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>No, bass, it was a rebuke from taxpayers who are tired of supporting a large, uneducated, expanding underclass, being lied to constantly, gouged by out of control taxes, and the insulting, condescending tones of the idiots in the statehouse.</p>
<p>Why is it always the Kulaks that have to live within their means and not the government?  </p>
<p>All the best to the BNP, it&rsquo;s now or never.</p>

		<p><i>Health Secretary Andy Burnham agreed: &ldquo;It is a sad moment. There are concerns about immigration. The Government have to get a response to those concerns. We have got to understand why people have voted for the BNP. We should redouble our determination to take them on and take them out of British politics.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Translation:  They need to start faking right wing populist rhetoric in order to get votes.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re white nationalists, not a &#8220;race realists.&#8221;  &#8220;Race realists&#8221; can be of any race and can even hate white people.  Many self described &#8220;race realists&#8221; in fact are anti-white asian-supremacists.  Let&rsquo;s stop using that stupid term.</p>
<p>Margret Thatcher was one of the worst things that ever happened to the UK.  Her lies about stopping immigration almost single-handedly destroyed the National Front, a racial nationalist party that had massive popular support in the 70&rsquo;s and which the BNP is essentially descended from.  Once in power, Thatcher did absolutely nothing to reduce immigration and continued all the anti-white policies of the previous governments.  </p>

		<p>15 Anonymous: I agree mainstream parties will unite to crush nationalism. This has already happened, and &#8220;oddly&#8221; enough, even capitalists and the left will do so: the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks and the Schiff banking family), India (a few instances), and maybe even Cuba prior to their revolution, if not more. For some reason they both hate what nationalists stand for, especially if ethnic issues are combined against capitalist exploitation.</p>
<p>54 Joe: I think so too. &#8220;Race realism&#8221; means little to me and focusses too much on racial biology and genetic determinism. It also ignores important ethnocultural factors (such as the fact that at some point Southern whites are not going to want to disappear in a sea of American whites). White or European (American) nationalism is closer to the mark and can include cultural, ethnic, economic, political and other factors like a complete ideology should.</p>

		<p>54 Joe again: Thatcher lied but politicians often lie. Bush II gave the impression he would stop mass immigration by saying something like he would solve the problem. Obviously to him that meant amnesty. Some solution.</p>
<p>Part of the plank of a nationalist platform could be a demand for laws that require politicians to keep promises made during election campaigns. These promises should be in black and white and as detailed as possible. We need no longer submit to ambitious or unprincipled people who think it is okay (moral) to break their word upon gaining office. Rather, we should demand high moral standards. The legal details of such laws would of course have to be worked out like with all laws. For too long have politicians gotten away with this kind of lack of accountability; accountability at the polls is too weak a check for the democratic process to function as morally as it should and needs to be given some teeth. How about fines and even imprisonment if a poltician breaks a campaign promise? The threat of that could make upright men out of our leaders if they can&rsquo;t do it themselves.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent proposal. I&rsquo;ll definitely go with that.  At present, election promises mean nothing once a candidate is in office, and there is no way of holding him accountable.</p>
