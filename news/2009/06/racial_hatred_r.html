			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corina Knoll, Los Angeles Times, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The house, a three-bedroom cream-colored residence on a peaceful street, even had yellow and red roses waving merrily from the front lawn. And while the backyard was cramped, there was a nectarine tree, a red swing set and a small gazebo.</p>
<p>This is it, Channise Davy thought. Home.</p>
<p>Happy to have found a place near her salon in Altadena and close to her fiance in Pasadena, the 31-year-old hairdresser moved her four children from North Hollywood into the one-story charmer on Broach Avenue in Duarte last fall.</p>
<p>Davy never thought about the fact that they would be the only black family on the mostly Latino block  &mdash;  until someone reminded her in a way that still makes her eyes tear and her stomach twist.</p>
<p>On May 8, Davy opened the door to her home and was greeted by a barrage of spray-painted racial epithets. The hardwood floors, the mirrors, the televisions, the dressers  &mdash;  the vandals had turned the entire place into a canvas for that six-letter word used for decades to scare and scar African Americans.</p>
<p>Shaken, she immediately left and called police. And aside from one trip back to pick up some clothes, Davy has refused to return to a scene authorities believe was created by members of a local Latino gang.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident has been the talk of Duarte, a predominantly white and Latino bedroom community of 25,000 in the San Gabriel Valley. Black and Latino gangs have been active in the area for years, and last year a rash of interracial shootings occurred in nearby Monrovia.</p>
<p>Since the break-in, Davy and her children have lived in a hotel paid for by the county, but those funds ran out Saturday and she is struggling to find a new home in a place that feels safe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As she spoke, Kenny Johnson was two miles away, lugging green garbage bags down the sidewalk of the working-class neighborhood where his children once played. The father of three of Davy&rsquo;s children, he had come to the house that morning with his brother and two friends to begin clearing away what belongings could be salvaged.</p>
<p>Johnson said he plans to marry Davy, but he keeps his own apartment so she can maintain her Section 8 eligibility. They had discovered the Duarte house together and agreed: Beautiful home. Beautiful neighborhood.</p>
<p>But after the break-in, the 36-year-old barber sees only an intimidating residence littered with shards of glass. &#8220;We were quiet people, man,&#8221; he said, shaking his head in disbelief as he picked up children&rsquo;s shoes and toys. His children haven&rsquo;t seen the vandalism and only know that something bad happened there.</p>
<p>While his friends pulled a mattress out of the master bedroom, Johnson stopped to look at a wall calendar of Barack Obama. &#8220;This is the only thing they didn&rsquo;t touch,&#8221; he said, smiling at the irony of hope hanging on one wall and hate spray-painted across the rest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the few whites who live in the area, Peirce said she hadn&rsquo;t thought about racial tension during the three decades she has lived on Broach Avenue. She never imagined anything would happen to her black neighbors, especially because they seemed like nice people who were often at work.</p>

		<p>Here is what a lot of Americans across the country cannot seem to comprehend about many hispanics. They often give elderly and other white people hell that live in their neighborhoods, now why would anyone assume that they are going to like black people, who don&rsquo;t really care about Latino issues,at all.</p>

		<p>The street behind the one I have live on for quite a while, had a black family move in about 15 years ago and in all honesty the father mother and two kids have been so quite that you wouldn&rsquo;t know they were there. It is ironic that the area is still very caucasian, and yet with all of the animosty that many blacks harbor against whites,this black family has had no problems with their neighbors. This seems to support what so many people have said, that if they think whites have been unfair to blacks, just think of what hispanics are going to be  &mdash;  THEY,won&rsquo;t move away.</p>

<p>I think this excerpt is the gem of the entire piece and addresses a for more widespread problem than the epithets.</p>
<p>Note, too, this article is by Corina Knoll. I believe she is the Korean adoptee who spit in the face of her white adoptive parents, and the white community in Iowa where she grew up, in a semi-autobiographical piece for the LA Times a couple months ago. That article was rooted in a sympathetic interview she did with that old hag who does the unethical blue eye/brown eye experiment on schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Regarding the subject of this article, while the treatment is unfair, I am not going to lose sleep over it because I never see articles bemoaning the fact whites are run out of their neighborhoods by black criminals. What&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander.</p>

		<p>This is really a pretty sad story. It does illustrate, however, that vicious racism is no longer the province of whites, who have become probably the least racist group in America, at least in terms of taking overt discriminatory actions against non-whites.</p>

		<p>MY Oh MY what do we do with our INSTINCTS?  We try scrubbing and scrubbing but they keep resurfacing. I think race is more than skin deep and the Latinos not known for being educated out of their common sense to the point of instinctual sterility declare this with unavoidable clarity! They don&rsquo;t want to lose their Indio heritage and why should they. As well they recognize the native difference between their more introspective or soft spoken style and that of the black which is of course a whole different matter.</p>

<p>There were about 5 passages from this article I was going to dissect, but this one absolutely speaks for itself. This is a microcasm of the black race. This woman has lived off of the hard working White man and woman and we are supposed to have sympathy for her? How about being a MAN and taking care of your kids and not blaming Whites and Latinos for their &#8220;racism&#8221;!</p>

<p>By &#8216;American family&rsquo; are they talking about white folks, and by &#8216;dream home&rsquo; are they talking about America? Those liberals are often too sophisticated for me so I&rsquo;m trying to interpret this in a way that makes sense.  </p>

		<p> This appears to be just another excuse for a liberal reporter to write a &#8220;poor, put-upon blacks&#8221; story. How do authorities know that it was a Latino gang that did this? Why didn&rsquo;t the reporter interview any of the Latino neighbors to get their take on it? Remember that incidents like this have happened before, with the &#8220;White racist&#8221; or, in this case, &#8220;Latino racist&#8221; perpetrators later being discovered to be the black occupant herself   &mdash;   or perhaps some of her fellow blacks trying to throw suspicion onto non-blacks living in the neighborhood.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the &#8220;Latino gang&#8221; proves to be imaginary, and if Ms. Section 8 is determined to be the person who vandalized her own house. On the other hand, maybe you should be surprised if you see it, because the mainstream media will try to bury any such revelation. Why spoil a good story with the truth?  </p>

		<p>Good God spare me this absurd touchy feely effort to place blacks in another sympathetic situation, as if they&rsquo;re not guilty of horrendous racism themselves.</p>
<p>This Corina Knoll is silly if she thinks she&rsquo;s going to create a sympathetic figure among Hispanics and aware whites, especially in the Southwest where brown and black fighting grows increasingly worse by the day.</p>
<p>Just wait a while longer when more jobs are lost, then take note of the increase in chaos.  The country lost 500,000 plus jobs in May, with California the largest loser, so the unemployment figures keep growing and more mestizos are taking black jobs.</p>
<p>The area is either going to erupt into an intense armed conflict, and the blacks are going to be annihilated if they don&rsquo;t leave on their own accord.  They&rsquo;re badly outnumbered, and they&rsquo;re getting exactly what they give to every other racial group when they&rsquo;re in the majority and are able to mob lone victims&hellip;.or few victims&hellip;..so the chickens have come home to roost, as that brilliant philosopher and icon of American patriotism, Jeremiah Wright would say. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t enjoy every word of this article.</p>
<p>Future stories will be even better as the situation continues to deteriorate.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the L.A. Times will print an article about Whites that are brutally forced off their property that&rsquo;s been in their family for GENERATIONS, often being murdered in the process. Or maybe an article about the violents Whites in this country have endured when blacks take over their neighborhoods. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s still plenty of Whites still alive today that went through the &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; of Detroit that would gladly give them the details. So- - cry me a river!!!</p>

		<p>I have an aquaintance who is from Honduras with whom I enjoy to speak on racial/social issues. He is so open and blunt about racial issues, and insists that all his fellow Hondurans think likewise, it is refreshing in a bizarre way. Simply put, he tells my virtually all South and Central Americans despise or at least fully distrust and dislike Blacks&hellip;with a passion. It is basically a cultural norm in that part of the world. Go figure&hellip;  </p>

		<p>When is Al Sharpton, Jessie Jackson, the King family, and President Obama going to organize a march and a demonstration at the steps of city hall in Duarte? When is the media going to keep this in the national headlines for months like they did with white college kids that supposedly raped a black stripper?</p>
<p>I forgot. The assailants weren&rsquo;t white. Things can be handled with things like &#8220;outreach&#8221; programs that brings blacks and latinos together like they always do. Got to keep up the facade of multiculturalism and everything is Kum-bi-ya by the fire. </p>
<p>These incidents don&rsquo;t matter to whatever black civil rights leader, where ever they may be in this country, just so long as it&rsquo;s not whites victimizing and murdering blacks. </p>

		<p>Notice when hispanics do something, it&rsquo;s not blamed on all hispanics, just on a hispanic gang. If whites did the same thing, even if were a gang, it would not be blamed on a gang, the news reports would describe them as a &#8220;neo-nazi gang&#8221; in a segregated, racist all-white hate-filled neighborhood. It would also be on the national news and every talk show</p>

		<p>She owns a &#8220;salon&#8221;. She&rsquo;s a welfare cheat. She still gets a house. Smart Mexicans get her and her litter removed from their neighborhood. Am I supposed to feel bad   &mdash;  - for her?  <br>
Separate issue: is whatever welfare dept handling her case going to cut her off since we all now know she knows the father of her kids and he purposely keeps a separate legal residence, and she owns her own business, all the while &#8216;maintaining section 8 eligibility&rsquo;? </p>

		<p>I think the section 8 comment is very interesting. Rascism is wrong, wrong, wrong.<br>
But one of the issues that fuel it is that a single mother with 4 children and two baby daddys who is not the least bit embarressed to admit to being a welfare cheat which is what  applying for section 8 benifits when their is a man involved who could be helping to support this family without public money is. <br>
That money doesn&rsquo;t grow on trees, it comes from my paycheck, and i am living check to check.</p>

		<p>If I had a dime for every Apartment Building in New York City, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, as well as once beutiful homes in Queens, and Staten Island, that the Blacks burned to the ground, I could probably save General Motors, finacially. </p>
<p>Everyone I grew up with came from the City and outer Boroughs, from the 1950s through the late 1970s, to get away from what was happening there. Their parents couldn&rsquo;t sell and move fast enough.</p>
<p>Now, to revisit the old Neighborhoods is to drive through what looks like bombed out Europe, after the War.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember the Evening News interviewing German Tourists that were taking a Bus Tour of Harlem, and they stated, again, that it looked like Germany after World War II. </p>
<p>There were so many beautiful Victorian-era homes, and Apartments with Italian marble floors that were just demolished by these animals. </p>
<p>Of course, what the Blacks, and the Hispanics really destroyed was our sense of Community; of Neighborhood. Of playing Stick ball in the streets, and cook-outs in front of several Apartment Houses, where all the Neighbors made something, and shared with each other. </p>
<p>They destroyed families meeting on the street corner, and all of us walking to Church together, on Spring and Summer Sundays. </p>
<p>The Minorities destroyed Rockaway Playland, and the Coney Island, where generations used to go, every summer. You can still go there, today, but you might take your life in your hands doing so. </p>
<p>So, I have to say, that I simply do not care what happened to these people in the story. It may sound callous, and it is, really, but when I think about all they have taken from me, and from those I have known, over the years, it doesn&rsquo;t even begin to even out. </p>
<p>These Blacks got a small taste of what White people have had to deal with, for over 50 years. </p>

		<p>While working the ghetto as a police officer, I quickly learned something: lazy blacks target mexican homes all day, while the mexicans are at work! At night, the blacks target mexican vehicles, stealing tools and lawn maintenance equipment. In MY area, where the blacks had organized gangs, they also robbed, beat, and killed the mexicans at will. Is it ANY wonder why the mexicans despise blacks and don&rsquo;t want them living among them??</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. As a U.S. Border Patrol Agent, I quickly learned how filthy and uncivilized mexicans are. They are just as bad as blacks. If there is any hope of sustaining and securing our white existence, we must find a way to separate ourselves. (Such as the Northwest Migration project). The Pacific Northwest is the only area of the country left for us; it&rsquo;s our LAST RESORT. </p>
<p>I find it amusing (and nauseating) that even when attempting to portray blacks in a positive light, their blatant and obvious criminality cannot be ignored. These dregs of society are SCAMMING the welfare and government housing systems, and the county in which they live is PAYING for them to stay in a hotel!!! And OH&hellip;BY THE WAY&hellip;.feel SORRY for them, because their time in the hotel is running out!!! Cry me a river&hellip;<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, hispanic communities are out. That leaves white or black. There are likely few white communities left. There must be some black communities. Why doesn&rsquo;t she try living in a black community? Oh, yeah, blacks don&rsquo;t like living with blacks. They prefer to risk being lynched and being reminded of the legacy of hate they endured by being around whites.</p>

Note, too, this article is by Corina Knoll. I believe she is the Korean adoptee who spit in the face of her white adoptive parents, and the white community in Iowa where she grew up, in a semi-autobiographical piece for the LA Times a couple months ago. That article was rooted in a sympathetic interview she did with that old hag who does the unethical blue eye/brown eye experiment on schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Here is a link to that article:<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/o3nap7" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/o3nap7</a></p>
<p>She sings the praises of self hating Jane Elliot. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from the article which sums it up;</p>
<p>The daughter of white parents, I grew up in a predominantly white city, attended an overwhelmingly white school and interacted mostly with white friends. The subject of race in my community was hidden, buried under rhetoric that insisted we remain &#8220;colorblind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott was the first white person I ever heard who admitted to the privileges of whites, acknowledging that visible differences affect how the world perceives us. Her words sparked a hunger in me for more.</p>
<p>My first year in college, I took courses on race and ethnicity and Asian American history. Race, I learned, permeated everything, and it was OK to say so. I found myself with strong opinions and a circle of outspoken black and Asian friends with whom to share. The world felt bigger, and I felt empowered.</p>
<p>And look at who she married:<br>

<p>What this Korean adoptee, like many non-whites want, is for whites to be colorblind only when it suits non-Whites. However, at the same time, non-whites want to reserve the right for themselves to be racial beings and have their own culture but only for themselves, for whites to do so is &#8220;racist&#8221;. In other words, non-whites want it both ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elliott was the first white person I ever heard who admitted to the privileges of whites, acknowledging that visible differences affect how the world perceives us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Privileges, what white privilege? It&rsquo;s the non-whites that are favored in everything from jobs, government aid and everything else. Speaking of privilege, in Korea, Koreans are privileged. So if the adoptee is so upset about whites, perhaps she should move to Korea. Bet you won&rsquo;t see that happening, non-whites for  all their talk of racism would much rather stay around racist &#8220;whitey&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t condone criminality, but somebody is going to eventually get victimized in any situation like this  &mdash;  either the black family who is forced out, or the non-blacks who are eventually forced out  &mdash;  of their neighborhood. </p>
<p>My grandmother was forced out of her own home  &mdash;  the one she had lived in for 40 years  &mdash;  by black crime and general nastiness. Black neighbors that she had helped out financially burglarized her home, her shoulder was broken by a mugger in her own front yard, and neighbors shot each other in a drug deal gone bad in the next-door apartment building. No reporter ever covered her story, or that of countless other whites.</p>
<p>We never had problems like this when &#8220;controlled segregation&#8221; was enforced in the US. The harder-working blacks stayed in the same neighborhoods as the poorer blacks and served as role models. People were not traumatically forced from their homes due to culture clashes. Entire cities did not collapse. It was better for the environment as well  &mdash;  both natural and human. The loss of common-sense is the real tragedy.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I remember the Evening News interviewing German Tourists that were taking a Bus Tour of Harlem, and they stated, again, that it looked like Germany after World War II.</p>
<p>And during the 1970s when I was a regular commuter on the Market St.-Frankford Elevated, the view could also have been compared to Germany right after the war. Difference being the destruction and trashing perpetrated by Philly&rsquo;s Black citizens, rather than Allied bombings.</p>
<p>West Philly too, was once a beautiful area. As were other parts of the city. But the Blacks moved in right after WWII and the destruction went into high gear.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sorry. I shouldn&rsquo;t say anything like that. Being the TRUTH, it just might be misunderstood and termed &#8220;racist&#8221; talk.</p>

<p>I have doubts the vandalism was committed by the local loco mestizos.  If they trashed the whole house, but left a calendar of the O Man untouched, that sounds more like an inside job, and the bros or sistahs couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to deface a picture of their GBG (great black god).  What I think this is all about is the welfare queen/baby machine mama had a sub-prime mortgage on the house (the article says they moved in last fall) with an ARM which probably went sky high, so she was in way over her head.  What a slick way to slide out of a forclosure situation.  And get a free tab at a local hotel to boot.  I also doubt it was some little run down hotel, more likely it was in the 5 star category.

<p>QD, I&rsquo;m not sure what point you are trying to make. Folk culture is always strongest in the countryside. On the return trip in Europe, the places to find German culture would be Austria or Bavaria, more so than Berlin. The back to the land movement has deep and respectable roots in Europe and in America. </p>
<p>Where would you suggest Europeans find American culture  &mdash;  -in New York or LA? I suppose it&rsquo;s a matter of taste and what your idea of culture is. Is culture money and commercialism, or is culture traditions passed down and preserved over generations? </p>

		<p>I have a couple of questions about what I have just read in the article and comments.  First, I am curious about how it is that we see so many single family houses rented out in the California area. In other parts of the country single family homes are rarely rented.  Most of the rentals are in multi family homes.</p>
<p>Secondly, as I read several comments about the crime wave in some cities begining in the 1950&rsquo;s, it made me wonder if these cities had liberal welfare policies even back then. Welfare lures the worst members of society and promotes generations of disfunctional people.  Welfare is a disincentive to everything that is good and an incentive to everything that is bad. </p>

<p>Fed Up,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be sorry. A &#8220;racist&#8221; is someone who SAYS what everyone else already KNOWS but is AFRAID to say.</p>
<p>I taught at a High School right near the Erie-Torresdale El station. Some of my colleagues rode in from West Philly on the El and told horror stories about the antics of Blacks .  The referred to the EL as the &#8220;African Queen&#8221;. Over the years I watched the steady deterioration of the entire Northeast Area especially the Northwood section of Frankford all the way to Bridge street. My own neighborhood, the North Penn section of North Philly, bordered by Allegheny Avenue on the North and Lehigh Avenue on the South and 20th Street on the East to 30th Street on the West was a healthy area of mostly working class Irish and Italian Americans, where on summer evenings the sky was illuminated by the lights from Connie Mack Stadium AKA Shibe Park. You could hear the cheers of the crowd throughout the neighborhood. It was an area in which one could walk at any hour of the day or night without fear for one&rsquo;s safety. That all began to change in the late fifties when dreaded diversity began. Unscrupulous realtors (May they burn in Hell) practiced &#8220;Block Busting&#8221;. They bought properties and moved Black into them and profited on the panic of the White residents who quickly succumbed to the fear that their property would decrease in value.<br>
Within less than ten years it was all over. It was like a social Melanoma that spread inexorably from York Street North until the entire neighborhood was gone. Every night was puncutated by police sirens and assaults and fires became commonplace.  People, I include myself, fled to areas like Roxborough and the Northeast but our security was short lived.<br>
There isn&rsquo;t much left of Philly that&rsquo;s still habitable for the civilized. Manayunk has had a Renaissance but I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope that it&rsquo;ll last. <br>
I rarely go back to Philly these days and then only when I visit the few friends who still live there. Even Center City is scary especially now that da youfs be wilding.</p>

		<p>Southern California resembles nothing more than a gigantic cockpit in which the differing roosters (placed there by the politicians)are literally kicking each other to death and pecking each others&rsquo; eyes out for the deification of the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; crowd.In this, it increasingly resembles the ultra-Darwinian favelas and slums of Latin America in which only the meanest and nastiest survive.<br>
  Keeping with the cockfighting analogy, Mexicans resmble so well the character and temperament of the gamecock so well - it is no accident that Mexican fighters dominate the lightweight boxing divisions in which they have the comparartive advantage.The point is Mexicans simply refuse to be &#8216;punked out&rsquo; by blacks and in the ultra-macho, primal male world of the gangbangers and prisoner they are willing to fight to the death, even when covered by blood and wounds rather than be humiliated by blacks, it is this &#8216;heart&rsquo; which makes Mexicans such dangerous opponents of blacks, even though the blacks might be bigger and stronger than the Mexicans.<br>

		<p>How is it we see so many single family houses rented out in California?  The reason that Southern California has rental houses is that for years the politicians were afraid to get the property owners mad by allowing multi-family dwellings.  Most of Los Angeles was actually farmland in the 1920s, so there was plenty of room for everyone to have a house and a yard.  The zoning laws, in line with the will of the people, allowed very few apartments, and they were all two stories at most.  That&rsquo;s changed, but there are still a whole lot of single-family houses  in many run down neighborhoods.  Of course, many of them are now packed with multiple families.  </p>

		<p>I have spent time throughout Florida working in and among various community associations, businesses, and governmental agencies, and I have seen first-hand that the hispanic-black &#8220;alliance&#8221; is a myth.  Lower-class, more Mestizo-influenced Latinos consider blacks their bitter rivals for minority entitlement, while higher-class, more European-influenced Latinos simply find blacks to be generally distatesful in the same way that most self-respecting whites do, as well.  There are some exceptions, of course, as there are in any situation, but not as many as desperate blacks would like to see. </p>
<p>The huge advantage that hispanics have in doing battle with blacks is that, as another &#8220;minority,&#8221; hispanics also enjoy the perception of perpetual victimization, and victims doing battle with other victims is never regarded as being as bad as when evil whitey beats up on a victim class.  Additionally, the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; with which so many whites allow themselves to be smeared cannot, obviously, stick to hispanics, which deprives blacks of perhaps their best weapon in the realm of racial politics when facing off against Latinos and their interests. </p>

<p>  The same thing happened to my grandmother but without as much violence and mayhem. Almost overnight the street turned black and subsequently the neighborhood became noisy, dirty, littered, and dangerous. The beloved old spacious Victorian Gothic style family home was sold at a loss and my grandmother, aunt and uncle moved to a smaller (less nice) ranch home in the suburbs.  </p>
