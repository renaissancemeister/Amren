<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-watts-priest12-2009jun12,0,1148722.story">In Watts, One God, Two Cultures</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ari B. Bloomekatz, Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To those who know it only by reputation, the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts is a forbidding place, plagued by violence and poverty and ruled by African American gangs.</p>
<p>So naturally, Father Peter Banks brought 200 Latino parishioners there in December for a posada, a Christmas ritual that re-creates Joseph and Mary&rsquo;s search for a place for Jesus to be born.</p>
<p>Banks, pastor of St. Lawrence of Brindisi Church on Compton Avenue, thought the visit could help burst preconceptions and break down prejudices. His Latino congregants might be surprised to learn that violent crime was down at Nickerson, that gangs were not as pervasive as they once were and that, contrary to stereotype, a majority of the residents are Latinos.</p>
<p>If African American residents turned out in decent numbers, the service would be another small step toward mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The Latino visitors walked briskly through a parking lot and into Nickerson&rsquo;s gym, some casting nervous glances over their shoulders. Inside, mariachis in black outfits and gold ties tuned their violins. A small group of black community leaders helped prepare champurrado and chicken tostadas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The posada drew several hundred people, but they were almost all Latinos, not the integrated crowd Banks had hoped for. Still, he considered the event a small victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Banks, 63, a Catholic priest from a tiny Irish village, has become an unlikely force for racial understanding in Watts. Over more than three decades, he has watched as the community changed from predominantly black to predominantly Latino. He&rsquo;s seen racial tensions lead to segregation within his own congregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In reality, many of Banks&rsquo; efforts to bring blacks and Latinos together have ended like the posada at Nickerson Gardens, with less interaction than he would have liked.</p>

		<p>So what? The fact is that most Blacks are probably baptists or methodists or pentecostal. Most Hispanics are catholic. I am a White presbyterian.</p>
<p>You probably will not find too many Muslims and christians worshiping together. This is a non-story.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Latinos have different cultures and different worshipping styles, just like Whites, and this isn&rsquo;t going to change. Why don&rsquo;t these social engineering types just give it up and let people do what they want and stop trying to force that which is not wanted.</p>

		<p>Where is Commissar Obama to decry that &#8220;sunday is the most segregated day in America.&#8221; We clearly need to a federal program to force these people to integrate. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts is a forbidding place, plagued by violence and poverty&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In another life, that I&rsquo;d like to forget, I used to pass this wretched housing project on my way to work.  One of my female colleagues had the driver&rsquo;s side window of her car smashed in while stopped at a red light directly in front of the project, her purse grabbed and the jewelry from around her neck ripped off.  The criminals would lie in wait, wait for the light to turn red, run out and rob stopped motorists then scurry like rats back into the projects. </p>
<p>The &#8216;red light rip-offs&rsquo; became so bad around Nickerson Garden that it was eventually surrounded by a fence made up of closely-spaced metal posts,  about eight feet high, curved inward toward the projects, with each metal post tipped by a large sharp spike.</p>
<p>Also this from the article:</p>
<p>&#8221;&rsquo;&hellip;In reality, many of Banks&rsquo; efforts to bring blacks and Latinos together have ended&hellip;with less interaction than he would have liked&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gimme a Break!</p>
<p>Another in a long line of foolish White do-gooders, this one from the church, who believes he is going to &#8216;break down racial barriers&rsquo;,  &#8216;help burst preconceptions&rsquo; and  &#8216;break down prejudices&rsquo; and then is shocked, Shocked! when HIS preconceived notions of &#8216;universal harmony among men of all colors&rsquo; are proved so wrong.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the young, miseducated Teach For America types, full of marxist clap-trap, who believe THEY will be able to accomplish universal peace in violent ghetto schools and save non-White children from evil, murderous Whites. And why not, they&rsquo;re taught all their lives that this is an achievable, possible, desirable, heroic goal. </p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, the preconceptions and prejudices the hispanics and blacks have for each other are justified. And maybe they don&rsquo;t want to be forced together, just as most Whites would rather be around their own kind.  </p>
<p>Do you think after 30 years Father Banks has reached this inevitable conclusion? Nah, he&rsquo;ll ask for more donations to continue his work.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>This happened to a girlfriend of mine in Myrtle Beach, S.C. idling on the BLVD in traffic in her Corvette a black walking between traffic suddenly reached in, grabbed $30,000 worth of gold from around her neck and ran away. I&rsquo;m lucky in that I have friends in low places and WE caught him later.</p>

<p>Is Bloomekatz implying that since Latinos have become the majority in this project, violent crime and gang activity have gone down? If so, that would be more of a miracle than any priest could ever pray for! Get real!</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality, many of Banks&rsquo; efforts to bring blacks and Latinos together have ended like the posada at Nickerson Gardens, with less interaction than he would have liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;and there seems to be no evidence to suggest that his &#8220;efforts&#8221; will magically bring about the change he desires if the results have always been the same in the past; &#8220;in reality,&#8221; that is. </p>
<p>Padre, you need a reality check and so does Ari Bloomekatz!<br>

<p>For years now Latinos (along with Whites) in the United States have been leaving the Catholic Church in droves.  In fact, it&rsquo;s gotten so bad that according to recent studies less than 60% of Latinos now identify themselves as Catholic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2002-12-12-hispanic-catholics_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2002-12-12-hispanic-catholics_x.htm</a></p>
<p>While some of them are being drawn to other churhces (like the Pentecostals), the largest segment of them appear to be following Whites into a secular lifestyle.  This is no doubt the main reason why the Catholic Church is going gung-ho to smuggle illegals into this country.  It&rsquo;s a transparently desperate attempt to fill rapidly emptying pews.</p>
<p>The only pertinent line in this article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Latino visitors walked briskly through a parking lot and into Nickerson&rsquo;s gym, some casting nervous glances over their shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody likes blacks (including other blacks) and everyone knows why, even if they don&rsquo;t want to admit it.  That&rsquo;s the main reason why you can&rsquo;t get anyone (in appreciable numbers, anyway) to want to worship with them if they can help it.</p>
