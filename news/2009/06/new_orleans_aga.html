<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D98IN8L02&amp;show_article=1">New Orleans Again Nation&rsquo;s Murder Capital</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fresh FBI statistics show that with 64 killings per 100,000 people in 2008, New Orleans had the highest per capita murder rate in the nation, well ahead of second-place St. Louis, which had 47 murders per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge, which gained population after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, came in No. 7 with 30 murders per 100,000.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s report bases its per capita number on a New Orleans population of 281,440 for July 1, 2008. The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center put the city&rsquo;s population for the first half of 2008 at 324,357. But even using the higher estimate, the city recorded 55 murders per 100,000 to still lead the nation.<br>

		<p>If you lose the World Series, you get no trophy.  If you finish in second place in the Presidential Election, you have no power.  The salutatorian can&rsquo;t give the Valedictorian&rsquo;s speech.  But finishing in 2nd place in the Murder Rate Bowl like St. Louis did still means you&rsquo;re a dangerous city.  It does mean that the city politicians don&rsquo;t have to disparage the survey&rsquo;s methodology, nor hypocritically they don&rsquo;t get to use the survey&rsquo;s results as proof for higher taxes/more gun control/more community centers/more Federal pork.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again (especially for our black trolls):</p>
<p>There is a built-in punishment in blacks; and this built-in punishment becomes evident whenever blacks are left to their own devices. Of course while they co-exist with others, they will always have some one else to blame for their failures.</p>

God have mercy on us all.</p>

		<p>In view of the fact that NO was invaded post-Katina by working class illegal Mexican aliens while the NO Chocolotiers chilled out in Houston, it would certainly be more instructive to see some comparative statistics of Big Easy violent crime stats over let&rsquo;s say the past ten years detailing the races of victims and perps. (whilst bearing in mind that Hispanic perps are white and Hispanic &#8220;victims&#8221; are &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; per DOJ/FBI crime stat reporting protocols)</p>

		<p>Well, New Orleans, after Katrina, was down, but not out. These people even continued to loot, rape, and murder, during, and after Katrina, and Rita. Hence, all  that we heard about, taking place at the Super Dome.</p>
<p>Of course, we also heard what condition the Super Dome was in, after these poor people took refuge there, during the storm.</p>
<p>So now, Ray Nagin&rsquo;s &#8220;Chocolate City&#8221; is once again reclaiming the mantle of &#8220;Murder Capital of the USA&#8221;. Well, you have to be first in something, and if it&rsquo;s not Job Creation, and attracting new Businesses, and Industries there, or even a winning Football Team, then it may as well be murder.</p>
<p>I am surprised that D.C., and Detroit aren&rsquo;t higher on the list. </p>
<p>And, we all know that Newark doesn&rsquo;t like to be left out, either.<br>

		<p>&#8220;64 killings per 100,000&#8221; </p>
<p>The ratio is: 1:1,563<br>
or, one chance in 1,563 that you will be murdered this year.</p>
<p>But note the ratio is for one year.<br>
That is, 128 people will be murdered per 100,000 over a two year period.</p>
<p>If extrapolated over two years, the ratio becomes:<br>
2:1,563 or one chance in 782 of being murdered </p>
<p>If extrapolated over ten years, the ratio become:<br>
10:1,563 or one chance in 156.3 of being murdered</p>
<p>Anyone care to move to New Orleans for ten years?</p>

		<p>The reason the traditional leaders in the Murder Bowl were displaced, is that large sections of their cities appear to have been depopulated completely:</p>
<p>The Ruins Of Detroit</p>
<p>Think of a prairie fire. The animals flee from the approaching wall of flames, some are not fast enough and are killed. The flames sweep over the habitat and consume it; what&rsquo;s left is a charred, barren landscape. </p>
<p>Eventually, the habitat will regenerate itself, but the analogy breaks down at this point. I don&rsquo;t see who would bother trying to rebuild these cities, only to have them ruined again.</p>

<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t have a 1 in 156 chance of being murdered; firstly I&rsquo;m not black, secondly I&rsquo;m not male, and thirdly I don&rsquo;t go venture to their blighted neighborhoods or projects.  The murder &#8216;victims&rsquo; are almost exclusively black males. I&rsquo;d venture to guess 95% of them, maybe more.</p>

		<p>i moved to new orleans proper from early 1981 to summer 1989. at that point, the city&rsquo;s population had been majority/minority at around 60 percent for a few years and we were under the administration of the city&rsquo;s first black mayor, morial. i was fresh from going to school in a part of houston where i had spent 5 years where there were literally no blacks&hellip;.pasadena, the blue-collar working class section of town where the movie &#8216;urban cowboy&rsquo; starring john travolta and debra winger was filmed. <br>
later i became aware of the psychology of why white liberals are so unprejudiced when they aren&rsquo;t in the proximity and therefore the danger of blacks. we see this in states like new hampshire, maine, minnesota and wisconsin. liberal as can be. <br>
upon moving to new orleans, i was struck at how seemingly racially prejudiced the whites were. through the first few months, it became apparant to me the reason why. fear. fear motivates prejudice and the fear and disgust of what blacks had done to their city - essentially taken over - along with the treatment they recieved in the city of their ancestors by blacks had conditioned them to be this way. it seemed only natural. they were fed up with the crime, blight and other outrageous behavior i don&rsquo;t have room to go into here. being in a majority black city certainly opens the eyes of former white liberals - many who moved into the city a from northern cities - many relating how they just couldn&rsquo;t get over how prejudiced every white person was. they had a crash course in african-american culture and became some of the more prejudiced than those whites born and raise in new orleans.<br>
this explains why states like the above mentioned i.e. those with very low black populations went for obama. ignorance.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m part of a big Cajun family.  We have relatives living all over the deep, dark, South.  When the family gets together, it&rsquo;s become tradition for the branch living in that year&rsquo;s murder capital to emerge from their cars chanting &#8220;We&rsquo;re number ONE! We&rsquo;re number ONE!&#8221;  Sometimes, the big yellow foam fingers are deployed.  There&rsquo;s been repeated talk of awarding a big, shiny trophy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure the fact that every one of those murder capitals is chock-full-O&rsquo;-blacks is purely coincidental.  It&rsquo;s about &#8216;Crime&rsquo;, you know, not about race.  &#8216;Crime&rsquo;, apparently, is something not dissimilar to the &#8216;Miasma&rsquo; that used to cause Yellow Fever in these parts.  It must be a substance similar to those &#8216;Clouds of Evil&rsquo; the Pontiff declared to be hovering over Africa.</p>
<p>Thank you, Flaxen-headed Strumpet, for my favorite new term for the problem demographic.  Henceforth, they shall be known as &#8216;Chocolatiers&rsquo;.  By appetizer-time tonight, at least two dozen households in Monroe and Lafayette will be using &#8216;Chocolatier&rsquo; in a whole new context.  I take it you are somewhere in Uptown New Orleans, where there are maybe a few witty people still alive&hellip;  Stay safe, girl! </p>

<p>&#8220;Majority minority!&#8221;   That&rsquo;s a term that really bugs me.  Can there possibly be any more ridiculous piece of double-talk?    Well, possibly a &#8220;light black&#8221;    &mdash;   that&rsquo;s another one.  Orwell would love it!
