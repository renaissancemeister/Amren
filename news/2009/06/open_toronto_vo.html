<h1><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1683380">Open Toronto Voting to Non-Citizens, Miller Urges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allison Hanes, National Post, June 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Calling it an issue close to his heart as the child of an immigrant single mother, Mayor David Miller last night threw his support behind a movement to give non-citizens the right to vote in Toronto municipal elections.</p>
<p>Enfranchising newcomers who live in the city but have not yet attained citizenship would be a first in Canada, but not the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s my view that those people who have chosen to make Toronto their home and live here permanently should have the right to vote in municipal elections in exactly the same way as Canadian citizens,&#8221; the Mayor said during a city-organized panel last night.</p>
<p>The remark garnered applause from some 200 people attending the discussion in chambers at city hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;From my perspective you can&rsquo;t be an inclusive and open government unless all of the residents have an ability to choose that government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said his 2006 election platform contained such a plank. And he explained to the crowd that his views were formed by the experience of his mother, with whom he came to Canada from England in 1967.</p>
<p>While her job qualifications as a teacher were challenged, Mr. Miller recalled, she was able to vote because she was a subject of the British Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said if it were up to him, all newcomers who use and pay for city services would have the right to participate in the democratic process.</p>
<p>Only the province has the power to change the rules, he added, encouraging participants in the forum to build a groundswell of support and begin lobbying their MPPs to change the law.</p>
<p>The panellists included a Dutch diplomat, a New York activist and an author, all of whom spoke in favour of the proposal. The discussion was moderated by Councillor Janet Davis (Beaches East York), who also approves of granting voting rights to non-citizens, saying it &#8220;goes to the heart of ensuring social inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Author Alan Broadbent, chairman of the Maytree Foundation, the Caledon Institute of Social Policy and the Tamarack Institute, said 30 countries around the world allow non-citizens to participate in city elections. New Zealand even allows people residing in the country longer than six months to cast ballots nationally.</p>
<p>Although there were no detractors of the idea in attendance, Mr. Broadbent attempted to refute arguments against extending the vote.</p>
<p>Rather than be a degradation of citizenship and an erosion of Canadian identity, Mr. Broadbent suggested enfranchising newcomers is a good way to integrate immigrants to Canada by quickly giving them a stake in their new communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice is really this: Will we give them shackles or will we giving them wings?&#8221; he said, pointing out that for 80 years Canada did not rely on citizenship to determine voting eligibility, which has evolved over time.</p>
<p>Astrid De Vries, deputy consul-general at the Dutch consulate in Toronto, offered facts on The Netherlands&rsquo; three-decade experience allowing noncitizens who have been in the country for five years to vote in municipal elections and even run for office.</p>
<p>She said the origins of the idea came from successive national governments and cut across party lines, gathering support on both the left and right of the political spectrum. It is considered quite successful, she said.</p>
<p>Activist Diana Salas described efforts to give non-citizens voting rights in New York City, where council can decide on its own to change the electoral rules.</p>
<p>The original concept of extending the vote to all residents of the city, including illegal immigrants, had to be scaled back in order to win favour with councillors to help move it forward, she said.<br>

<p>Aw, what the heck!  Why not just abolish citizenship entirely?</p>
<p>(That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re going anyway, isn&rsquo;t it?)</p>
<p>PS. Is David Miller a white man? Just because he &#8220;came from England&#8221;  in 1967 doen&rsquo;t nessarily make him English. A lot of West Indians (and others) have &#8220;come from England&#8221; waving British passports as they passed through immigration.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s go one step further and be totally consistent.  Give everyone in the world a vote in Toronto&rsquo;s elections.  Why should we discriminate against anyone who does not have the ability, ambition, means or desire to migrate to Toronto?</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he just call this what it is, disenfranchisement of Canadian citizens?  If this clown wants aliens to be able to vote, not only will it negate one for one the votes of citizens, but it will empower the aliens to &#8220;rob&#8221; the Canadian public fisc even more openly than now, by &#8220;voting&#8221; in candidates sure to transfer wealth from Canadians to Third World squatters.  How long are Canadians going to stand for this??</p>

		<p>&#8220;there were no detractors of the idea in attendance&#8221;. Do you want to know why? Because in Canada one can barely open one&rsquo;s mouth without running into the hate speech laws. Think about it! If you give reasons why non-citizens shouldn&rsquo;t vote you are saying there is something wrong or incomplete about them. They are lacking compared to real citizens. That could lead to hate. Busted!</p>

		<p>Toronto is not far away from being the Canadian &#8220;Detroit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Miller is a race traitor first class.</p>
<p>He will do anything to gain or hold power and his thinking is that the third worlders are so prevalent in Toronto that he wants their vote more than white voters.</p>
<p>Miller may be white in color but he is black in policy.</p>

<p>David Miller is a white man.  He was born in California of an American father and British mother and came to Canada with her when he was 7.  The story is like that of Obama except Miller stayed out of the country but Obama came back.</p>

<p>I guess this guy doesn&rsquo;t see that as soon as those illegals and others can vote, they will vote HIM out and vote their own IN. Fools, fools all of them (in the U.S. too)</p>

<p>How anyone could hold a view this demented, only a &#8220;progressive&#8221; could understand. Why should someone who has neither been responsible for building up the nation, paying their share of taxes, and in general having been a part of the culture of a nation, be given any say in the way it is governed. This attitude isn&rsquo;t inclusive and it isn&rsquo;t be generous, it is being ignorant and naive.</p>

		<p>Letting illegals vote is insane. But is it really that much different than multi-ethnic mass democracy? One way or another Democracy becomes a breeding contest to see which ethnic group can outpopulate the next.</p>

		<p>Toronto&rsquo;s extreme socialist mayor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(Canadian_politician)" rel="nofollow"><b>David Miller</b></a>, usually bellows over this city&rsquo;s exploding gun crime.</p>
<p>Miller will scapegoat the U.S.   &mdash;   from where he assumes most illegal guns cross the border into Canada   &mdash;   instead of placing blame directly where it belongs&hellip;in the <i>Black</i> hands that are responsible for almost all the shootings. (Another lame-brain idea of his, was to ban long established Gun Clubs in the city)  </p>
<p>These people are either recent immigrants or their offspring  from which he&rsquo;s willing to bestow even more power over White Canadians through the ballot box. As another poster above pointed out &#8220;not only will it negate one for one the votes of citizens but it will empower the aliens to &ldquo;rob&rdquo; the Canadian public even more openly than now, by &ldquo;voting&rdquo; in candidates sure to transfer wealth from Canadians to Third World squatters.&#8221;</p>
<p>This scenario is already happening in California and their many illegal newcomers are easily accomplishing this feat through the womb in that state. </p>
<p>But this short term mayor could care less about the long term effects he&rsquo;d have on our own populace, so long as he keeps pandering to minority votes. <br>

		<p>David Miller is hated by most taxpayers in Toronto. Just one of his latest scams is to force a $200 tax on those paving their driveway, while another is to impose a $50 fine on those with no pet licence and employs an army of student snoopers to spy on householders. So if your cat jumps up on the windowsill to get some sun like happened to one lady you&rsquo;ll be hit with the $50 fine. Most of those paying these excessive taxes are Canadian-born people and the fact that this is taking place in every white-majority country by neo-Marxist creeps like Miller makes it blindingly obvious that it is a deliberate policy of cultural genocide by the neo-Marxist elite. Miller is reminiscent of early 80&rsquo;s liberal Toronto Mayor John Sewell who also relied largely on the immigrant vote to screw the country&rsquo;s founding peoples.</p>
<p>These excessive taxes on people in white-majority countries, like the smoking ban, the man-made climate change scam (people who are worried about the demise of the planet are much less likely to worry about mass immigration swamping their country), are part of the neo-Marxist worldwide cultural genocide agenda (see Fabian Socialist H G Wells&rsquo; article The Open Conspiracy)to swamp white nation-states with mass immigration/multiculturalism &amp; implement their One-World government plan. However our neo-Marxist elite never explain why if mass immigration/multiculturalism is so beneficial to all, Turkey does not import millions of Africans, and why it is virtually always one way, into white-majority countries only.</p>

What&rsquo;s the quote, &#8216;a democracy will only last until the people realize they can vote themselves money&rsquo;? (or something close to that).</p>
<p>So someone from anywhere can move to my town without ever having contributed anything to my community and they should be given the right to vote for their own interests?</p>
<p>Why not go further. Give them the right to vote and take away ours. That would speed up the process.</p>

		<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say anywhere that the voting will be open to illegals, only &#8220;non-citizens&#8221;, which could be the equivalent of legal permenant residents here in the U.S., as well as asylum seekers and the like.  However, I&rsquo;ll bet illegals will be included or just registered to vote anyway, regardless of the rules, just like in the Southwest U.S. by Hispanic activists.</p>
