<h1>White House Says Immigration Reform Unlikely in &rsquo;09</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith Koffler, Roll Call, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The White House on Monday acknowledged that immigration reform is unlikely to move in Congress this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gibbs [White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.] added that Obama hopes that &#8220;later this year that we can have the beginning of formal debate on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama has consistently put other priorities  &mdash;  including energy and health care reform  &mdash;  ahead of an immigration bill, hoping to have both approved in 2009.<br>

		<p>And if Obama can&rsquo;t get amnesty thru in 2009, he won&rsquo;t even try in 2010.  Unemployment will be over 10% in 2010, and middle class will be sick of two years of no jobs while watching their wealth go down the drain.  So politicians who favor giving jobs to illegals over Americans will suffer in 2010 and the new Congress will be even less eager to tackle amnesty in 2011.</p>
<p>Obama will continue to pursue a &#8220;de-facto&#8221; amnesty by failing to enforce the law.  Bad, but nowhere as bad as giving illegals citizenship! </p>

		<p>The problem with Obama&rsquo;s approach is that overpopulation is at the root of most of our national problems.  Hence, solving immigration is the most pressing need.  </p>
<p>An analogy is a house fire: During a house fire, you could open the windows to get fresher air, you could turn up the AC to cool the house, you could move furniture out of the house, or you could call your congressman and ask for taxpayer assistance to rebuild.  But a more logical action is to simply PUT OUT THE FIRE!  Immigration is a fire that makes all other problems worse, including, water, energy, and natural-space shortages, while increasing, urban-, emergency room-, and school-crowding, energy costs, air and water pollution, traffic &amp; traffic accidents, exotic diseases and crime, prison populations, pollution, garbage, taxes and government costs, and overall stress.  ALL OF THESE ARE MADE WORSE BY INCREASING POPULATION.  We cannot solve these other problems without first stabilizing our population, which requires reducing immigration.  </p>

<p>But how can this be?</p>
<p>I thought our multicultural demigod Obama, could do anything and everything!</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t he make all of the sainted &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; citizens?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t he provide us with unlimited and free energy sources?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t he simply pass a bill that not only heals the sick, but also grants immortality to all of the Earth&rsquo;s citizenry as well?</p>
<p>For that matter, why has he not gotten us a time machine or a warp driven space fleet going yet?</p>
<p>I was told that he would bring about hope through change, and I am not seeing it; in fact, I am almost despondent with my unfulfilled dialectical expectations!</p>
<p>Will we ever have our Utopian States of America???</p>

		<p>Our power grid throughout the country is overloaded.  There are no plans to increase electrical energy availability. Adding to the load will mean that rolling black outs just as California has will be the norm.</p>
<p>Ground water levels are down by 25 feet in many areas of the country and expert projections are that they will not only remain low, but will drop further with an increase in the poulation.  Right now many parts of the country are in a drought situation and have been for several years. </p>
<p>For example, the big urban areas of Florida go thrugh water rationing every year, because they&rsquo;re just too much of a load on them right now.  Water pipelines extend from the areas in the north to the Tampa Bay area and the heavy population centers in the south, which is depleting water resources in the northern areas of the state. Theirs have long since dried up.  </p>
<p>Similar situations are at play in many parts of the country.  A few of our rivers that used to empty into the Gulf of Mexico year round now dry up every year.   When they finally do recover, the water depth is substantially less than at any time in history.</p>
<p>This country WILL&hellip;.without doubt&hellip;.go into a depression deeper than the one we have right now.  As we get further into this year or the first of next year, job losses are going to be at critical levels, raising to a possible 15% as a national average. with California reporting well over 20%.  Eventually the national jobless average will increase to 25% or more (1932 depression levels) and California will be off the charts.</p>
<p>The WSJ is reporting that right now&hellip;.this fiscal year&hellip;.most states cannot meet their budget requirements with budget shortfalls in the billions.  California&rsquo;s deficit is about 24 billion dollars, forcing the governor to release prisoners early, lay off prison guards, reduce the police, teachers, and other state employees.  Many programs for the elderly are being cut.  Medicaid is in danger of collapsing as is welfare.  Parks are being closed and schools are going to have to be cut back to a 4 day schedule. A vote by the citizenry to raise taxes was defeated, but it would have been difficult to invoke anyway, since the people can&rsquo;t pay taxes if they&rsquo;re spending all their earnings on necessities like food and shelter.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the problems an increasing population has had on this country, which would have been bad enough without the depression, but with it the nation is unsustainable.</p>
<p>And the one thing that could cause us to disolve completely into a non-nation state much faster would be the addition of more peole to this country, drawing on social benefits, and depleting natural resources as well as man-made ones, like food.</p>
<p>My vision of the United States about 2014 or 15 is like a giant aftermath of a situation like Hurricane Katrina, if it doesn&rsquo;t occur before then.</p>
<p>Granting amnesty to millions of illegals who have a country rich in water, oil, acreage for crops, with two beautiful coastlines, will likely cause Mexico to fare better than the US, in the final analysis. Most all their low achievers are here right now with the rest waiting in the wings for the nod to swarm across the border. </p>
<p>Yes, the illegals here right now are pulling on our natural resources, but it will be worse when they&rsquo;re granted citizenship, because of their family members and others who will also migrate.</p>
<p>Certainly this messiah sees that.  But I&rsquo;ve reached the conclusion he doesn&rsquo;t care.  He wants this country&rsquo;s white population percentages watered down even further, and this agenda has a higher priority with him than even the survival of the country.  The self-hating whites, and those who just can&rsquo;t understand the problems facing us, are with their messiah 100%.</p>
<p>A good analogy to Obama&rsquo;s amnesty desire is the New York Times. The NYT is collapsing right this minute.  That they&rsquo;re going to go belly up is a foregone conclusion.  They&rsquo;ve lost millios of readers and thousands of advertisers, because they place their radical leftist agenda over and above everything, going so far as to falsify many news stories if they believe it will promote their agenda.</p>
<p>The messiah and his coterie of mentally challenged radicals hold these same exact radical leftist views as the NYT.  If it&rsquo;s a matter of being fair and impartial at the expense of curtailing their leftist agenda, or practicing intelligent, sensible policies, promoting their agendas takes precedence over everything. </p>

		<p>When it occurs, Obama&rsquo;s concept of reform will be to legalize all<br>
of the illegals. The democrats are building a permanent, dependent welfare constituency from third worlders. At some point, the country will not be able to sustain the costs: financial, criminal and otherwise. To a large extent, illegal immigration accounts for the insolvency and rapidly growing <br>
 third world character of California.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Obama knows that the issue of immigration is a hot one. I&rsquo;ve never understood why. It&rsquo;s black and white - no gray undertones. Illegal aliens do not belong here. They need to go home. Illegal means unlawful. If the President were asked if he supported crime, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s say &#8220;no.&#8221; However, as long as the millions of illegals stay, he is giving his approval. Many others are too. They have their own agendas. Votes and cheap labor. The cheerleaders for illegal immigration - La Raza, The US Chamber of Commerce, and all those who profit from illegal immigration will be pandered to. None of them really care about illegals, it&rsquo;s just  what they can provide. It is unthinkable that a once proud nation as ours would cower in the corner afraid of not being politically correct. Opening our country (our home) to millions of criminals is a complete sell out of legal, law-abiding citizens.</p>

		<p>It is key to remember that the pro &#8220;reform&#8221; types like La Raza and the unions don&rsquo;t want tough employer sanctions and verification. Likewise they will constantly try to dilute the quality of border enforcement, both in terms of personnel and the fence that was to be constructed but has not been.  </p>
<p>The public may be fooled to accept a &#8220;path&#8221; to citizenship for illegals who have been here for a while and who work, albeit sporadically.  But the public wants Mexico sealed off and wants the slimy employers to be severely punished if they hire cheap foreign labor in place of decently paid Americans.</p>

		<p>In addition to all other objections to the &#8220;national health care&#8221;, here is the most scary part:</p>
<p><b>People will be forced to trust their health care (including serious surgeries, if needed) to &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; doctors/surgeons, who got accepted to prestigeous medical schools in order to redress past discrimination and injustice.</b></p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t count on any politician, no matter how opposed to socialized medicine, tho bring this up.)</p>
<p>Just think of your favorite hospital run by blacks (like, for instance, the MLK Hospital in L.A., closed due to negligence that led to patients&rsquo; deaths): what if you will end up assigned to one like this as your primary provider for your all health care needs? You may safely bet that anyone criticizing this kind of arrangement will be called &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>The federal intervention on behalf of the &#8220;poor and under-represented&#8221; has already wrecked public education system in the U.S. Unlike public schools, though, you won&rsquo;t be able to avoid enjoying the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of diversity and multiculturalism by opting for private care simply because it will be driven to extinction and/or become prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>One more point. All those who even think of Obama &#8220;universal health care&#8221; as a workable deal, go to any emergency room to see what kind of care you may hope for if that plan materializes. There are tons of stories about seriously ill or injured patients dying while waiting there for 24+ hours because the personnel was busy treating illegal Mexicans with cold and flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, all these illegals and their kids will end up in front of you in your doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>

		<p>They will just keep on pouring in here across the wide open borders in time for that immigration &#8220;reform&#8221;&hellip;guaranteed to add millions more to the amnesty rolls. The people spoke out the last time they tried this and how many millions more have come across since? So who&rsquo;s the real winner here? The illegals and our corrupted government, that&rsquo;s who. They laugh at us.</p>

		<p>The amnesty agenda is more than just getting Dem votes  &mdash;  -it will give the Dems so many new votes it will crush any conservative party for the foreseeable future.  It would be a death sentence for conservatism, rule of law, fiscal responsibility, and personal responsibility.  </p>

		<p>Were Obama to sign a bill legalizing illegals, he would be backstabbing his fellow blacks bigtime.  He&rsquo;d be the biggest Judas goat in history.  So, yes, he&rsquo;s going to drag his feet on this one!</p>
<p>Whites are at least somewhat insulated from immigrant crime and job and housing competition; blacks are not.  Whites will be a majority for a couple more decades, and a plurality long after that; blacks are already a minority, and a third-place one at that.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, Obama is president because millions of whites realized that John McCain betrayed them in the Senate, while almost no blacks recognized their equivalent betrayal by B.O.</p>

		<p>I have written in the past that the individual States, that have now reaffirmed their Sovereignty under the 10th Amendment, should begin identifying, arresting, and Deporting all Illegal Aliens, back to their home Countries. </p>
<p>Apparently, the Federal Government cannot be bothered to actually do the few tasks that it is charged with doing, and was the reason for its creation in the first place, such as to REPEL INVASIONS, and ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY. </p>
<p>They have failed miserably at both. </p>

		<p>Why would the administration risk a white middle class uprising?  Better to keep them enstupified with sports and entertainment while working on those middle class welfare programs.  Besides, with unemployment high, why get into a philosophical argument that cannot be won at the moment.  Better to ignore the issue for the time being.  By the way, those of you who were trying to tell us that McCain would be the best of two bad choices: what do you think now?  Imagine the hell of a McCain presidency right about now and thank your lucky stars that bozo lost.  Now we&rsquo;ll wait for the Dems to implode&hellip;</p>

Whenever I hear comments like this, I just have to laugh. The HMO system did all this stuff years ago. I haven&rsquo;t seen a white, American doctor in years. </p>
<p><i>these stupid liberal voters who want everything free from the government better realize quick, that right now their doctors belong to them, after health care reform their doctors will belong to obama, and the government.</i></p>
<p>Actually, right now, our doctors do not belong to us, they belong to the HMO. At least when the whole shebang is socialized, we&rsquo;ll no longer have to deal with the insurance runaround. </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, these politicians of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, have honed the Art of Playing Americans, down to a science. They will just wait, while more and more millions upon millions of illegal aliens enter the U.S. from Mexico, establish families and stay here and when there are enough, AMNESTY WILL BE A FORGONE CONCLUSION. The same old excuses will be given for amnesty  &mdash;  these people are established here, they have paid taxes, they have families, and on and on. There will be little to NO resistance by the duplicitous American citizenry. I just finished reading that there are less e-mails by the thousands protesting amnesty than there were a year ago. I rest my case. </p>

		<p>Mexico&rsquo;s per capita murder rate is over three times that of the Unites States.  If you factor out the murders committed by Hispanics and black in America, then Mexico&rsquo;s per capita murder rate would be six to ten times that of the Unites States.  <br>
