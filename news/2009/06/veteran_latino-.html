<h1><a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/06/veteran-latinorights-advocate-charged-with-voter-fraud.html">Veteran Latino-Rights Advocate Charged With Voter Fraud</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Weikel and Shelby Grad, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Felony charges have been filed and an arrest warrant issued for a well-known Orange County political activist suspected of committing election and voter registration fraud, the California secretary of State&rsquo;s office announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Investigators in the agency&rsquo;s election-fraud unit said Nativo V. Lopez, 57, of Santa Ana leased office space in Boyle Heights and registered to vote using that address although he lived with his family in Orange County. They also say Lopez, president of the Mexican American Political Assn., cast an illegal ballot in L.A. in the 2008 presidential primary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lopez is a longtime Latino political-rights advocate in Orange County who served on the Santa Ana school board. Lopez has been a vocal advocate for Latino voting rights and supported immigrant amnesty and allowing undocumented workers to have driver&rsquo;s licenses. He could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

		<p>Remember, at least 3 million illegal aliens voted in the November 2000 Presidential elections, probably more in 2004 and last year.  What is stated in the article above is one way they get registered to vote, but even then it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that complicated.</p>
<p>You figure, in illegal alien heavy states like California, Hispanics and white leftists run the Canvassing Boards, Boards of Election Commissioners, or whatever they&rsquo;re called.  Do you honestly think most Hispanics are going to tell other Hispanics that they can&rsquo;t register to vote?  White leftists won&rsquo;t tell them no, either.  Amnestyaire U.S. Presidents, which have been all of them JFK onward, and their amnestyaire Attorneys General, certainly won&rsquo;t prosecute illegal aliens for having voted.</p>

		<p>Nativo(real name Larry)Lopez, has been advocating for &#8220;Latino Rights&#8221;,in California ever since the massive invasion some twenty five years ago. He discovered that instead of working at some boring but real job, this was exciting and a way to power. There is no doubt that Congresswomen Loretta Sanchez won in Southern California against incumbent Bob Dornan, because of the voter fraud that Larry Nativo Lopez and other reconquistas perpetrated. But what can one say? This is the state of present California politics  &mdash;  pure third world style. </p>
<p>P.S. Where is Ex President Jimmy Carter anyway? We don&rsquo;t need him monitoring voting in some third world nation, we need him in California, because it now qualifies as one of those places he is concerned about.</p>

		<p> As far back as Bob (B-1 ) Dornan loss in the nineties, illegals have been voting with impunity. When Dornan challenged the result, he was turned down by a liberal court that was just trying to keep the lid on things. What they have wrought.</p>

		<p>Bob Dornan deserved to lose, though maybe his constituents didn&rsquo;t.  He said something along the lines of, If you lose your blonde, blue-eyed country, Tough!  Trying to appease the Mexicans who voted for one of their own anyway.  Whites were fooled into thinking that he was one of theirs, but the Mexicans weren&rsquo;t.</p>
