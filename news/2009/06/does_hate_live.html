<h1>Does Hate Live in Your Backyard?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregg MacDonald, Fairfax County Times, June 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, which makes an annual national list of active hate groups, defines them as having &#8220;beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the SPLC, there are at least four separate organizations in Fairfax County that hold similar opinions and are officially considered hate groups.</p>
<p>One is the American Renaissance/New Century Foundation in Oakton. According to the SPLC, it is classified as a white nationalist organization.</p>
<p>Its leader, Jared Taylor, is a dapper, erudite intellectual who is fluent in Japanese. He was educated at Yale, but has since adopted a philosophy that he calls &#8220;race realism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor, who accordingly identifies himself as a &#8220;race realist,&#8221; said there are three primary components to that definition.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, we believe that race is a legitimate, biological phenomenon. Second, there are racial differences that go beyond mere appearance, and thirdly, we have a sense of racial solidarity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Racial diversity is a source of conflict and tension rather than being a strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor called the Holocaust Museum shooting &#8220;a horrible act of wanton violence,&#8221; but added that &#8220;if the country really cared about what crime really means, we would try to understand why, year-in-year-out, blacks are 30 to 40 times more likely to commit violence against whites than the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor said his organization &#8220;deplores violence and any form of racial or ethnic hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a U.S. Department of Homeland Security report that was declassified in April says that &#8220;the economic downturn and the election of the first African-American president present unique drivers for right-wing radicalization and recruitment&#8221; that could potentially become a catalyst for violence.</p>
<p>It says that right-wing extremist chatter on the Internet continues to focus on the economy, the perceived loss of U.S. jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors and home foreclosures. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The April DHS report says that if the economy continues to decline, right-wing extremism could fuel a resurgence toward that type of domestic terrorist activity. &#8220;White Supremacist lone wolves pose the most significant domestic terrorist threat because of their low profile and autonomy  &mdash;  separate from any formalized group  &mdash;  which hampers warning efforts,&#8221; the report theorizes.</p>
<p>But Taylor finds fault with that analysis. &#8220;If we are interested in examining the motives of violence, we should examine frequent, chronic crimes rather than aberrant cases,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that earlier this month, &#8220;a black convert to Islam&#8221; opened fire on an Army recruiting center in Oklahoma City, killing one soldier and wounding another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although Muslims have killed thousands more Americans than anti-Semitic nuts have, no one is wondering what the recruiting center incident means for America or for Islam or for blacks. Why the double standard?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>

<p>Funny, but these same people have no trouble attacking or maligning an entire class of people (whites) for such things as &#8220;historical racism,&#8221; &#8220;segregationism&#8221; and &#8220;institutional racism.&#8221; They have absolutely no problem fomenting hatred in blacks against whites by their constant cries of &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spending some of my growing up years in Gary, Indiana, I certainly saw plenty of hatred directed towards me by blacks. Nevertheless, I hold no hatred of blacks as a race, I merely recognize them as being different. Just as bees pollinate flowers, just as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, I recognize that blacks (and hispanics) are different from whites. Recognition of this fact does not frighten me, nor does it cause hatred. I simply accept it as the reality that it is, and expect society to do the same.</p>

		<p>The government/MSM warnings of white terrorism are intended to frighten the American people into accepting diminishing internet freedom and privacy, and to smear their enemies (small-government conservatives).  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the feds shut down this website and many others to protect us from the new &#8220;homegrown&#8221; terrorists.  They&rsquo;re working to wipe out dissent on the internet.</p>

		<p><i>perceived loss of U.S. jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors and home foreclosures</i></p>
<p>So nobody is actually losing manufacturing jobs, and nobody&rsquo;s house has gotten foreclosed.  It&rsquo;s all in our imaginations.  That means you, who used to work in the assembly line making Chrysler/Dodge minivans in Fenton, Missouri can go right back to your job tomorrow, it was just a bad nightmare that Chrysler went bankrupt and laid you off.</p>
<p>The media can get away with this legerdemain about the &#8220;perceived&#8221; loss of mfg. jobs because the Federal government now defines burger flipping as manufacturing.  A 50-year old man loses their $50,000 a year job on the auto assembly line, a mfg. job is gone.  A 16-year old teenager goes on part time at McDonalds, a mfg. job &#8220;gained,&#8221; so no loss.</p>
<p>The irony is that the home foreclosure thing is mostly a minority question, at first, until the George Soros-caused economic crisis exposed the swiss cheese nature of this economy, and now many formerly working and middle class whites are losing their homes.</p>
<p>I looked at the SPLC&rsquo;s map, and have never heard of most of the groups they claim exist.  Even though I was plugged into the right wing gossip circuit until a few months ago.  Methinks somebody has a fertile imagination, or enough pull with the FBI so that the FBI has their &#8220;informants&#8221; go out and dress in funny uniforms in public.</p>

		<p>SPLC, Please define what is a &#8220;Hate Group&#8221;. And, why is such<br>
a term is ever used, except to demonized groups that does not<br>
follow the agendas, and policies of the SPLC.<br>
It is through nonsense words, and unintelligent phrases in print, and by mouth, that this country, and western civilization is being torn down, and destroyed.<br>
When the SPLC, and like groups reach their goals. The results<br>
will be a far less free, and dangerous society for their opposition,and themselves to.</p>

<p>There is no &#8220;preceived&#8221; loss of jobs in manufacturing and construction for americans, there has been a big loss of jobs in american manufacturing and construction for americans. Either they have been shipped overseas or if here are usually made up of mexican labor.</p>

<p>We can be glad, at least, that the article&rsquo;s writer troubled himself to include a snippet such as this. Generally, the perspective of race realists is either summarized dishonestly by opponents or is ignored altogether. </p>

		<p>These people sitting around whining, &#8220;You&rsquo;re a hater, you&rsquo;re hating on them,&#8221; should thank their lucky stars they&rsquo;ve never seen <i>real</i> hate. Rudyard Kipling said it best in his poem <i>The Beginnings</i>:</p>
<p>It was not part of their blood,<br>
It came to them very late<br>
With long arrears to make  good,<br>
When the Saxons began to hate.</p>
<p>They were not easily moved,<br>
They were  icy-willing  to  wait<br>
Till  every  count  should  be  proved,<br>
Ere  the  Saxons  began  to  hate.</p>
<p>Their voices  were  even  and  low,<br>
Their  eyes  were  level  and  straight.<br>
There was neither sign nor show,<br>
When  the  Saxons  began  to  hate.</p>
<p>It was not preached to  the  crowd,<br>
It was not taught by the State.<br>
No man spoke it aloud,   <br>
When  the Saxons began to hate. </p>
<p>It  was  not  suddenly  bred,<br>
It  will  not  swiftly abate,<br>
Through  the  chill  years  ahead,<br>
When Time  shall  count from  the date <br>
That the Saxons  began  to  hate.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, the website I originally copied this from has changed &#8220;Saxons&#8221; to &#8220;English.&#8221; I restored it to the original version.)</p>

<p>Ironic that the wounded soldier was also black. This happened in West Little Rock, Arkansas. The shooter was quickly arrested and charged. He now says he was brainwashed by the Muslims.</p>

		<p>So far as I know the egregious SPLC has never listed the Black Congressional Congress as a &#8220;hate group&#8221;, despite its refusal to let a liberal white Congressman join.  And they have a much longer list of people they hate than I do.  I simply believe that there are significant innate average differences among the races, as there are between the two sexes, and that these differences, not &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;sexism&#8221;, account for the numerous disparities in outcomes that the liberals are always whining about.  So, for believing the evidence of sociologists, psychologists, and criminologists, as well as my own lying eyes, I am now officially a &#8220;hater&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the occassional &#8220;lone wolf&#8221; white nut case gets all the press, in the United States far more assaults and murders are done by blacks every year than by all the extremist vigilante whites in the past century.  But watch the FBI and DHS waste their efforts tracking down Amren readers.</p>

		<p>     Have you noticed that racially conscious whites are almost always described with biased language, while non-whites are described with neutral terms.  For instance:  black ativist  &mdash;  white racist, black militant  &mdash;   white supremacist, Latino spokesperson  &mdash;  white hatemonger, Latino anger  &mdash;  white hate, Asian organization  &mdash;  white&rsquo;s only club.   </p>

<p>Slight disagreement, and this might be a matter of distinctions and differences.  I think your description of the SPLC fits the ADL better than the SPLC.  It&rsquo;s the ADL that produces censorship software, the SPLC opposes this, for two reasons I think:  (1) It&rsquo;s giving money to the ADL that&rsquo;s not going to the SPLC.  As much as they are the same, they are also rivals when it comes to the money and raising it.  (2)  Civil libertarian reasons.</p>
<p>There is only one time that the SPLC had slight praise for the Council of Conservative Citizens.  Several years ago, a member in St. Louis got so mad that he couldn&rsquo;t access cofcc.org from a public library computer near the Lake of the Ozarks (blocked), that he contacted a noted 1st Amend attorney in St. Louis.  He hooked up with the CofCC, filed lawsuits, and won.  The text of the judgment in his/the Council&rsquo;s favor is now precedent to make blocking libraries back down.  When that happened, the SPLC had about five laudatory words in the next issue of their IR.  They probably had to be five very painful words for their clerks to key in, GITMO torture had nothing on that.</p>

<p>Since it was a fill-in, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t Rush.  Now you know it&rsquo;s not Mark Steyn.  And definitely not some of the other twits that fill in on a regular basis.</p>

		<p>Two sources (brief excerpts) on the Southern Poverty Law Center, of which many may be unaware: </p>
<p>1) LOU DOBBS responds to SPLC charge (12-13-07)<br>
(one minute into this 2 minute and 45 second video clip): <br>
https://www.americanpatrol.com/_WEB2007/071213.html </p>
<p>2) Alexander Cockburn, columnist for The Nation, Editor of CounterPunch, a man of impeccable leftwing credentials, has a blunt assessment of the SPLC: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Southern Poverty Law Center: We published a piece about them years ago in CounterPunch saying &hellip; it&rsquo;s scare-mongering for elderly people &hellip; elderly Jewish people across America, saying that if you don&rsquo;t send us ten bucks or twenty bucks the brown shirts will be marching down your main street tomorrow. SEND CHECK NOW &hellip; It&rsquo;s a racket, a lot of it.&rdquo;*</p>

<p>Finally, acceptance of the SPLC&rsquo;s expansive definition of &ldquo;hate&rdquo; precludes honest investigation of differences among races, cultures.  Perhaps that&rsquo;s the point.</p>

<p>Jared, at this point in time, it is time to throw the racism charge back at Moris Dees and Mark Potock. Enough is a enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the SPLC, while claiming to fight &#8216;racism&rsquo;, has few blacks that work for them and Morris Dees draws a huge salary from SPLC.  Is this true?<br>

<p><i>There has been a fill-in host on the Rush Limbaugh show who has cited Jared Taylor, AR, and the NCF in a glowing light, when it came to one of the releases of &ldquo;The Color of Crime&rdquo; several years back.</i></p>
<p><i>Since it was a fill-in, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t Rush. Now you know it&rsquo;s not Mark Steyn. And definitely not some of the other twits that fill in on a regular basis.</i></p>
<p><i>So who was it?</i></p>
<p><i>Hold on to your hat:</i></p>
<p><i>Walter Williams.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised.  Like Jesse Lee Petterson, Walter Williams is an intelligent and fair minded black conservative.  If his views were typical of blacks in America, race relations would be vastly better and maybe Amren wouldn&rsquo;t even be necessary.  Of course, those are the guys that most other blacks call &#8220;Uncle Toms&#8221;, because they don&rsquo;t hate white people and blame them for every problem in the black community.</p>

<p>Right, my own family only seems to care about the black killed in the museum, sad as that was, no one seems to remember the soldier shot and killed nor that a black muslim prison inmate convert(the worst kind) did it. I REMEMBER!</p>

		<p>Someome mentioned Alexander Cockburn. I read what Cockburn wrote about SPLC. In that post, Cockburn urged the SPLC to go after the Minutemen and immigration reformers in general. Alexander Cockburn-a LEGAL immigrant from England-is the mortal enemy of Native Born What Americans.</p>
<p>Alexander Cocburn&rsquo;s website Counterpunch has provided a forum for hispanics and asians who openly call for the race replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>What ever power the SPLC has is a function of the timidity of millions of Native Born White Americans. When enough Native Born White Americans openly oppose their race replacement at the hands of post-1965 asians,muslims,africans and hispanics, the SPLC game will be over.</p>
<p>In the mean time, White Nationlaists should be throwing the racism charge back at Mark Potok&hellip;.or you can do what Roy Beck does and base immigration refrom on how it &#8220;harms&#8221; asia LEGAL IMMIGRANTS from India,China and Korea in the hopes of appeasing Morris Dees and Mark Dees.

		<p>From what I can make out, the main purpose of the $PLC is to raise massive amounts of money from (what Sailer calls) the &#8216;Holocaust Scared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>VDare reports:</p>
<p>In FY 2008, the $PLC reported raising $32.4 million from the public&hellip; From its &#8216;Endowment Fund&rsquo;, the $PLC gave nothing ($0) to its alleged causes. </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/mc7c9s</p>
<p>It is the msm that give the $PLC  &#8216;sacred status&rsquo; allowing them to spew their venom far and wide as truth without refute or debate.  How often has potok been allowed to pontificate in the press about White-hate groups, White extremists and &#8216;home-grown&rsquo; White terrorists?  How often is dees given &#8216;the final word&rsquo; after a rare quote from someone such as Jared Taylor or Dan Stein?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The SPLC claims that Shawna Forde, the alleged killer of a little girl and her father during an Arizona home invasion, had ties to FAIR&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/meo7nw</p>
<p>FAIR has vigorously denied the allegations  &mdash;  but which version will the msm print?  I read the SPLCs claim here in LA in my local paper without ANY refute printed from anywhere or quotes offered from FAIR to defend itself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;[Taylor] was educated at Yale, BUT has since adopted a philosophy that he calls &ldquo;race realism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taylor said his organization &ldquo;deplores violence and any form of racial or ethnic hatred.&rdquo; &hellip;BUT a U.S. Department of Homeland Security report that was declassified in April says [yada, yada, yada]&#8221;</p>
<p>The author seems to be suggesting that a Yale education precludes race realist views? It&rsquo;s like saying &#8220;Charles Murray was educated at Harvard, but concurs with Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s research showing that different races show different levels of cognitive ability.&#8221; I woke up this morning, but I ate my breakfast.</p>

<p>Exceedingly few blacks, and not too many more Hispanics, have worked for the SPLC.  In June 2005, the CofCC National Conference was in Montgomery, at a hotel that is in The Center&rsquo;s shadow.  After the end of the conference, on a Saturday evening, some of us headed on over to the sidewalk between the old and new Poverty Palaces to show our dissatisfaction.  The local media showed up, and cop cars drove by and the cops honked and waved at us in approval, showing how well liked Mo, Mark and Heidi are liked in their own town.</p>
<p>One of The Center&rsquo;s black employees (perhaps the only one) stood in the foyer underneath the new building&rsquo;s main entrance to watch us all, and to make sure that we didn&rsquo;t invade the building (as if there were anything there worth taking).  He was the security guard.</p>
<p>There are at least two (that I know of) white Republican elected officials from the Deep South that have interned at the SPLC.  Meaning that the Center has had more white Republicans than blacks.</p>

		<p>Given the SPLC&rsquo;s checkered past and anti-white agenda I&rsquo;m surprised they&rsquo;re considered an authority on anything let alone what constitutes a &#8220;hate&#8221; group.  Consider the source, though.  Any group comprised mostly or entirely of white people who oppose the degradation and marginalization of their people and the cultural Marxist agenda are haters in the eyes of the SPLC and ADL.  </p>
<p>I think pro-white organizations need launch a propaganda blitz and educate people of all of the horrible, racially motivated crimes that have been and are being committed against us.  Kevin Schifflet, and 8yr old white boy who, in 2000, had his throat cut by a crazed black man is just one example.  The killer was later found in a hotel with NOI literature and allegedly penning a letter of admiration to Louis Farrakhan. The story, not surprisingly, did not get national coverage nor did media pundits or government officials declare that NOI was a public menace to Americans.  Since a black killed a white the story may have received all of 24hrs of coverage before being flushed down the memory hole.  </p>
<p>And before Obama and his ilk pass judgment they should be reminded that Bill Ayers and the Weather Underground killed more people and damaged more property than James Van Brunn.          </p>

		<p>Well, couldn&rsquo;t one argue that the election of Obama has been more recessionary than the attacks of 9/11?  Is MacDonald fearful of extremists or the possibility that fifty years of popular history could be a lie?  </p>
