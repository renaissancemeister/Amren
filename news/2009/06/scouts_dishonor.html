<h1><a href="https://www.ocala.com/article/20090615/ARTICLES/906159973">Forced Drinking of Urine at Boy Scout Camp Blamed on Racial Slur</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lise Fisher, Star-Banner (Ocala, Florida), June 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One adult and three teenagers at a Boy Scout camp are accused of forcing a boy to drink human urine because they were &#8220;teaching him a lesson&#8221; for supposedly making racial slurs to another Scout, the Putnam County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office reported Monday.</p>
<p>Investigators arrested Joseph Wendell Reid, 21, two 16-year-olds, and a 15-year-old, all from Ocala, last week on a charge of kidnapping.</p>
<p>Officers allege the four held a 12-year-old boy against his will, first taping his mouth shut and then forcing him to drink urine, according to the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>The four were attending Camp Shands at Baden Powell Road near Hawthorne, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are gravely disappointed to learn of this incident that happened between Boy Scouts,&#8221; said Jack Sears, CEO and scout executive of the North Florida Council for Boy Scouts of America. &#8220;The actions of the youth and the one adult do not represent the principles of scouting. Accordingly, their membership in scouting has been revoked.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident apparently was retaliatory and related to derogatory comments the younger child supposedly had made earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Reid was booked into the jail without bond. The three teenagers were turned over to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An officer spoke with the victim, who said he had been at the camp for a week and that he had been blamed for calling a boy who is black a racial slur, according to the report. The child said he did not use the slur but that the other boys didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
<p>Deputies reported the boy said he had been watching others compete in a swimming activity when he was asked by someone to go to his campsite. He had been walking for about five minutes when the four others ran out of the woods, grabbed him and forced him face down onto the ground. One put duct tape on his mouth, and they told him they were going to teach him a lesson, officers reported, and that he would have to drink urine or they were going to beat him up.</p>
<p>Then one of the four took off the duct tape and poured the urine down his throat, the boy told officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reid was a volunteer leader in scouting and was with the troop of the other Ocala residents involved in the incident, Sears said.<br>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of the ghetto lottery?  The ghetto alibi is to attack a white person, then use the excuse that he called you the n word.  Examining this story, I think all four suspects, probably black, had a beef with the 12-year old white boy over some other matter.  So they went after him, and played the ghetto alibi card when they got caught.</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t find out until near the bottom that the victim was white and the person he allegedly called the slur was black.  And the adult arrested is obviously white, how about the other three?  Did he find three other blacks to do this, a black and two white, three whites or what?  Was this one of those multiracial gangs that liberals are always putting on TV and in movies.</p>
<p>Of course our society teaches that racism is the biggest sin of all so undoubtedly the most impressionable youths are going to take that to heart.</p>

		<p> Aside from the adult who is pictured in the original article, the reporter does not let us in on the race of the assailants who committed this sickening act.</p>
<p> Normally, when races are concealed in a story, one can safely assume that if the people in question are thugs, they were black, and are being shielded for that reason. But in this case, given the fact that Reid is White, or certainly appears to be, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to discover that the other younger boys were White, too.</p>
<p> White young people nowadays have been so totally brainwashed about race that they believe committing murder is a lesser crime than &#8220;White racism.&#8221; What on earth has happened to this country? </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a strong response to racism. It&rsquo;s only some racism that is objected to however. These same youths are likely to use the term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in order to prove to everyone how enlightened they are. </p>

		<p>All the perps were white. I&rsquo;m assuming they were all white suburban teenagers who fantasize about being black because that&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s a kind of Stockholm Syndrome caused by integration. They were trying to act out the part so often played by blacks: getting really touchy about a perceived insult, then doing something over-the-top vicious for revenge.</p>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have to be &#8220;gravely disappointed&#8221; jack, old boy, if you hadn&rsquo;t helped create such a mind set in the guilty retards they felt compelled to act in such a disgusting way over hearsay evidence that probably wasn&rsquo;t true.  If it were true, however, the crime was just as great.</p>
<p>Anti-racism is the new Nazism/Stalinism/Maoism in the world today.  It will turn out to be, in the final analysis, the worst by far, because it will cause the destruction of the West when the others failed.</p>

		<p>Some White kids who are given to make believe like to tell stories about how they stood up to some racists, defended their Black friend, etc.  Don&rsquo;t all cool White guys have a Black friend/sidekick, just like on TV?  I guess these boys were really antsy to live out their fantasy.  </p>

		<p>This is probably the result of years of public school multicultural anti-racism brainwashing.  These kids are taught to believe that racial slurs are just about the worst thing that you can possibly utter.  I&rsquo;m not suggesting it was right, but when I was a kid (late seventies/early eighties) slurs were ubiquitous.  I wasn&rsquo;t in the Scouts, but was involved numerous sports groups and clubs, etc.  It was expected that each of us, no matter what race, would be on the receiving end of a little jazz.  It was just part of being a boy and growing up, taking your licks, giving them out, and toughening up.  This isn&rsquo;t just the result of anti-racism but also the feminization of boys in America.  </p>

<p>Perhaps the violence inflicted will BE ON THEM next time since the perps were/are so caring of the sensitivities of blacks. Blacks see that sensitivity as WEAKNESS as a lion sees a limping antelope.</p>

So they went after him, and played the ghetto alibi card when they got caught.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure their beef with him was simply that he was White.<br>
He was obviously outnumbered, and blacks are notorious cowards, who, because of their shamelessness, don&rsquo;t suffer from the sting of conscience that any of us would if we ever did anything that could be described as cowardly.  <br>
And just as there are noticeable gaps in IQ so too is there noticeable gaps in cowardly behavior.*</p>
<p>And as we all know, the MSM routinely ignores Black on White crime. But when they can&rsquo;t they simply, and shamelessly, spin.<br>
Sometimes the spinning is pretty drasitc, and desperate.<br>
For example, in a case as barbaric and depraved as this, what can you do if you are a Spin Doctor to take at least some of the heat off the guilty?<br>
Simple, you use the word &#8220;urine&#8221; as a noun, as in, &#8220;poured urine down his throat.&#8221;<br>
Instead of using it as a verb, which most surely would have been more accurate, as in &#8220;urinated on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, WHY did they put duct tape on his mouth in the first place?  To keep him from screaming?  But he was already deep in the woods with no one around to hear him, or at least to protect him.<br>
Why put the duct tape on and then take it off?<br>
Because they never took it off?  Or, never put it on?<br>
And who ever heard of any unrepentant thug giving options like it&rsquo;s a game show?  You know, as in, &#8220;do this, or we will do that.&#8221;?<br>
Of course, they are going to do BOTH!<br>
The only reason they didn&rsquo;t beat him up is because they urinated on him first!<br>
But they more than likely roughed him up at bit and then did the deed.  After all, who thinks they were gentle when they kidnapped him?<br>
Either way it would be good to know the details of this event.<br>
*There certainly is lots of cowardice among many Whites today, for reasons well-known to all here; but that is another matter.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s late, and I read the article quickly and posted immediately. So, my first comment made an omission; but, even though I did not ID the perpetrators correctly; I would still stick by the general thrust of my first post. The whole &#8220;Blacks Good - Whites Bad&#8221; Caveman-like simplification of the matter still served as the context for this act of depravity.</p>

		<p>This is just plain sick.  The sickest part of this is that the 21 year old and the others were probably White just like the 12 year old that they made drink urine.  The story doesn&rsquo;t say specifically but I have no problem believing that they were.  This is the state of affairs for White people today.  They attack their own while other groups laugh.  Where are we going to be in 10 years?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;blamed for calling a boy who is black a racial slur&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a close call; the writer almost said &#8220;black boy,&#8221; and we can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the PC doctrine of putting the person first, e.g., requiring that one say &#8220;person who was enslaved&#8221; instead of &#8220;slave,&#8221; or &#8220;people who are blind&#8221; instead of &#8220;the blind.&#8221; Of course the rule only applies to people who suffer some disadvantage to begin with, so the whole enterprise is absurd. They don&rsquo;t say &#8220;person who holds professorship&#8221; instead of &#8220;professor,&#8221; or &#8220;person who edits paper&#8221; instead of &#8220;editor.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This incident is a metaphor. If you are white and a black so much as accuses you of a racial infraction, you will suffer. And those who inflict the punishment are apt to be your fellow whites such as the &#8220;racially tolerant&#8221; Joseph Wendell Reid. </p>
<p>But wait! There&rsquo;s more! </p>
<p>If you are white, you are ipso facto guilty and therefore subject to punishment. And as the United States transitions to black rule, the enforcers will be black. </p>

		<p>This sounds to me like a hate crime directed against the 12 year old. Police should investigate the scout leader and the other boys who forced him to the drink urine and find out what race they are. This should be treated as a serious crime.</p>
<p>Because the victim is white, and accused of using racial slurs he will get little sympathy and his attackers will face no serious consequences for their actions. Whenever minorities attack a white person they can say the victim is a racist in order to try to justify their violent actions.</p>

		<p>Looking at the 21-year-old perp, I get a sick feeling that the urine incident was maybe a precursor to some sort of sexual sadism.  They obviously didn&rsquo;t think the kid would tell. They maybe were getting him under their control for things that would follow.  How many others has the 21-year-old &#8216;taught lessons&rsquo;? I bet this story goes way deeper than any perceived insult, and the details are probably nauseating.  My guess is that racism was not the core issue: just the excuse. Poor kid.  He&rsquo;ll never see the world in the same way again.</p>

		<p>If that 21 year old goes to prison (and he should) he will undoubtedly be subjected to endless brutalization and sodomy by black inmates. I don&rsquo;t think the black convicts will care about his attempt to punish a White for saying the N-word. He is due for a very RUDE AWAKENING&hellip;&hellip;</p>
