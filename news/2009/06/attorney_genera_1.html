<h1>Attorney General Wants Review of Cocaine Sentences</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Devlin Barrett, AP, June 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder sought support Wednesday for erasing the gap in prison sentences for crack and powder cocaine crimes, a disparity that hits black defendants the hardest.</p>
<p>The effort to change federal sentencing laws for cocaine has broad support but may still unravel amid disagreements about how equal the sentences should be, and whether the whole sentencing system needs to be changed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under current law, it takes 100 times more powdered cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger the same harsh, mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
<p>&#8220;This administration firmly believes that the disparity in crack and powdered cocaine sentences is unwarranted,&#8221; Holder said. &#8220;It must be eliminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The law was passed in the 1980s during the spread of crack in American cities, which officials blamed for a rise in violence. Yet in the years since, worries about crack have declined.</p>
<p>The most recent government figures show that 82 percent of crack offenders are African-American, while just 9 percent of them are white.</p>
<p>In remarks at the Congressional Black Caucus event, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who helped craft the sentencing guidelines that now are the subject of so much criticism and debate, urged Congress to focus first on the laws creating mandatory minimums for certain crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama administration wants to change the law to end the 100-to-1 ratio in sentencing, and make it strictly 1-to-1. Some lawmakers also want to change the law but aren&rsquo;t sure it should be reduced that drastically. There also is debate over whether to close the gap by raising the penalty for powder cocaine, in addition to lowering the penalty for crack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 100-to-1 ratio &#8220;is racial discrimination in practice,&#8221; said  Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who is pushing legislation that would end the gap by eliminating crack as a category in the criminal code.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mark Osler, a law professor at Baylor University and a former prosecutor, said there is general agreement on changing the law on crack cocaine but that any such change is likely to lead to other, more difficult questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to 1-to-1 is a big change. The question that really hasn&rsquo;t been resolved is 1-to-1 at what level. Is the penalty for cocaine powder going up?&#8221; Osler asked. &#8220;Also, there&rsquo;s a general consensus that we&rsquo;ll see something happen with crack. I&rsquo;ll be very interested to see if they argue for a move toward broader reform in sentencing.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What they conveniently forget to tell you is that the federal sentencing recommendations for Meth are one-half what they are for crack, for a given volume.  Therefore, Meth, largely Hispanic dealers and white users, has a 50 times disparity with powder cocaine, supposedly a white rich thing.  Does this mean the Feds have a grudge against Hispanics and the white working class?  Actually, they do for the white working class.</p>
<p>Also they forget to mention that in the mid to late 1980s, black politicians and the civil rights orgs wanted these harsh sentences, precisely b/c crack was so potent and blacks were so vulnerable.  Not that blacks anywhere anytime are every really angels, but 1985-93 was really bad for black crime, mainly b/c of the crack fad.  The sentencing disparities are why it came to an end.</p>

		<p>No what Holder wants is LIGHTER sentences, if not any sentences at all of blacks. This man is a flat out racist to the core. Welcome to Diversity. Keep chanting its our strength until your blue in the face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The most recent government figures show that 82 percent of crack offenders are African-American, while just 9 percent of them are white.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And somehow this is racist because black people apparently use crack more than white people! Oh – NO. Well I guess we have to just get more white people addicted to crack for it to be equal and all! /sarcasm </p>
<p>&ldquo;The 100-to-1 ratio &ldquo;is racial discrimination in practice,&rdquo; said Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who is pushing legislation that would end the gap by eliminating crack as a category in the criminal code.&rdquo; <br>
That tells me they will NOW legalize crack for black people but not whites? <br>
This man is incompetent to say the least. The country is being invaded by third world no productive people, the economy is almost in the tank, inflation is only getting worse, food and gas have gone up dramatically in the last 4 months at least where I live and BO is worried about this? <br>

		<p>When will people understand (or stop pretending not to understand)that crack and powder cocaine are not the same drug and do not have the same community effect&#8221;? Both are dangerous, addictive, and ruin and take lives. But they don&rsquo;t have the same destructive community effect. When was the last time you heard of an American suburb having a &#8220;powder war,&#8221; or an epidemic of &#8220;powder babies&#8221; being birthed by &#8220;powder whores?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Given Obama&rsquo;s admitted cocaine use, this is a genuine concern for the administration. </p>
<p>Blacks have been arguing for years about the disparity in prison sentences for using powder cocaine (an illicit drug preferred by white substance abusers) and cheap crack cocaine (the preference of many poorer abusers). </p>
<p>A police man once explained the difference which resulted in the differing laws: crack is considered more dangerous and crackheads become more violent. Since crack is cheap and highly addictive, it appeals to more blacks. </p>

As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you can let every black man and woman out of prison on the condition that they stay in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Blacks need to learn that black criminals are arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for a reason; to keep non-criminal blacks safe.</p>

<p>If blacks get more time it&rsquo;s justifiable for one reason or another.  Of that I&rsquo;m sure, because I&rsquo;ve seen too many blacks undersentenced for heinous crimes.  That&rsquo;s the norm, not the other way around.</p>
<p>But, of course, this Holder is so biased in favor of blacks, like the messiah, his ENTIRE agenda revolves around promoting blacks and their causes any way he can.  </p>
<p>He despises white people, in the same manner that Jeremiah Wright and the black theologists do.</p>
<p>What the fool doesn&rsquo;t realize is that he&rsquo;s helping to set loose more criminals in black neighborhoods and it will be the black populations who will feel the brunt of his stupidity.</p>
<p>The man is EXTREMELY dangerous and needs to be watched very carefully.  In fact this entire administration, containing so many black incompetents, full of hate for whitey, should be carefully watched as well.</p>
<p>I have no doubt they would eliminate whites to the last man if it were in their power.  It was a VERY DARK DAY when this black miscreant was elected to office, appointing a whole host of white radicals and black anti-white haters just waiting to get whitey every chance they can.</p>
<p>Their one burning desire right now is to try to shift white middle class wealth to blacks any way they can.  That&rsquo;s why they feel so desperately pressed to act as fast as they can before the economy gets worse and a few of the dupes in Congress will fail to support their radical agenda.</p>

		<p>Some countries have made drug possession a capital crime. I think that would be an excellent way to achieve &#8220;equity&#8221;. No doubt this new legislation is sponsored by the &#8220;cocaine lobby&#8221;. But look on the bright side, they&rsquo;ll probably start making &#8220;Miami Vice&#8221; again.</p>

		<p>Whether it is the &#8220;education gap&#8221;, the &#8220;economic gap&#8221;, or now, the &#8220;crack gap&#8221;, blacks are always on the wrong side of these gaps, no?</p>

		<p>Since gang rape is practiced exclusively by one segment of the population, then by the same logic they should reduce the sentences for gang rape. <br>
The ultimate goal is to let all non-Whites go free for their crimes and put all Whites in jail for their words and thoughts.<br>

<p>What an excellent idea.  Please bring that to Eric Holder&rsquo;s attention so he can get the SPLC to initiate a whisper campaign, backing such laws in Congress.</p>
<p>And, I hope they don&rsquo;t neglect to include penalties for whites who don&rsquo;t hold their mouths right when the messiah blesses them on t.v. with his words of wisdom.</p>
<p>I really think we can get this mess straightened out with these and similar laws and policies.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #4 reminds us that Obama has stated [I am not using value-judgement pejoratives like &#8216;admitted&rsquo; or &#8216;confessed&rsquo; here] that he tried cocaine.</p>
<p>Gosh, well so have I - once or twice - and my guess is that at least 5% of AR readers have - maybe 25% or 30%. Plus I&rsquo;d bet at least 50% of us have smoked grass or hash at least once.</p>
<p>The really important point was made by Chris N. #3: crack messes up communities drastically, powder cocaine doesn&rsquo;t. Cocaine will make a hole in your wallet long before it makes a hole in your nose [unless you reside in Perus, Bolivia or Colombia.]</p>
<p>As for meth, I&rsquo;ve never tried it; simply looking at the various horrific &#8216;faces of meth&rsquo; pictures-of-Dorian-Gray-speeded-up sites is enough to put me off completely.</p>
