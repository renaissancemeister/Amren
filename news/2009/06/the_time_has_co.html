			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gordon Edes, Yahoo! Sports, June 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s time to retire Cy Young. I&rsquo;m all for tradition, but baseball has more important people to remember than a man who began his career in the horse-and-buggy age. He&rsquo;s had his name on the award for the game&rsquo;s best pitcher for over half a century, plenty long to honor his place in the game. See ya, Cy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rename the award after a man who won more games than Young, struck out more batters than Nolan Ryan, pitched in at least twice as many games as anyone else, and had a persona that rivaled Babe Ruth&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The name is Leroy &#8220;Satchel&#8221; Paige, and it deserves to be etched on a trophy that would guarantee he will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Why bring this up now? For two reasons. On Saturday in Cincinnati, baseball will stage its Civil Rights Game, an event created three years ago to draw attention to the game&rsquo;s racial legacy, which pre-1947 meant players of color were excluded from wearing a big-league uniform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But just as the civil rights movement did not originate with Martin Luther King Jr., so too did others pave the way for Robinson&rsquo;s historic debut. And at the top of that list is Satchel Paige, the great Negro Leaguer who may have done more than anyone else  &mdash;  when given the chance in barnstorming tours against white teams, winter ball in Latin America and in mixed games in California and North Dakota  &mdash;  to prove that the game suffered for not being colorblind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jackie Robinson was the father of equal opportunity in baseball, surely Satchel Paige was the grandfather,&#8221; writes Larry Tye, author of the new biography, &#8220;Satchel: The Life and Times of an American Legend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reading Tye&rsquo;s exhaustively researched biography of Paige&rsquo;s incomparable career, which over the arc of 40 years arguably made him the most famous African-American of his time, also served as impetus for my nominating Paige to supplant Young on such an important piece of baseball hardware.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sure, Paige&rsquo;s appearance for Charlie Finley&rsquo;s A&rsquo;s at 59 was a promotional stunt, Paige pitching in 1965 on what Finley billed as Satchel Paige Appreciation Night in Kansas City, which became the pitcher&rsquo;s adopted home after starring many years for the Negro League Monarchs. Yet Paige needed just 28 pitches to record nine outs and allowed just one hit. &#8220;He was throwing 86 to 88 mph with excellent control and location,&#8221; remembers Bill Monbouquette, the Red Sox pitcher who opposed Paige that night and was Paige&rsquo;s final strikeout victim.</p>
<p>Paige had established his greatness long before Finley put a rocking chair in the A&rsquo;s bullpen. Bill Veeck, the Cleveland Indians owner who signed Paige to a big league contract on July 7, 1948, the pitcher&rsquo;s 42nd birthday, was witness to Paige&rsquo;s 13-inning 1-0 win over Dizzy Dean in California 14 years earlier. That remained Veeck&rsquo;s benchmark for pitching perfection, Tye wrote.</p>
<p>And as a larger than life character, whose sayings made it into &#8220;Bartlett&rsquo;s Familiar Quotations&#8221; (&#8220;Don&rsquo;t look back. Something might be gaining on you.&#8221;), Paige rivaled Ruth for his hold on the public imagination.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have embellished 20 percent of what he did,&#8221; Tye said, &#8220;but 80 percent of the core is true. Why threaten that 80 percent by embellishing anything. Because Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth, they had the press there to record everything they did and fan their legends. Satchel realized he had to do it himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can compare him to the Babe, everything from having gone to reform school, to their oversized appetites for food, women, attention. But the difference is Babe&rsquo;s story played out on Broadway. Satchel was in Outer Mongolia.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paige was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1971, the first Negro Leaguer to be so honored, and his statue can be found in Cooperstown as well. But his greatness as a pitcher, and legacy as the man who may have done the most to facilitate Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s great leap forward, deserve to be remembered in more than just a museum. It&rsquo;s time to start handing out the Satchel Paige Trophy, awarded annually to the best pitchers in each league.</p>

		<p>IF it is to be renamed it should be the BOB FELLER award!The greatest pitcher ever!If the Second World War didn&rsquo;t interupt his career no one would have been near any of his records .Every pitch that Feller threw was over 100 mph.He also pitched the whole game!</p>

		<p> Denton True &#8220;Cy&#8221; Young wasn&rsquo;t just another good pitcher. He won more games (511) than any other pitcher in major league history. He pitched three no-hitters in his career, including the first perfect game (allowing no hits, no runs, issuing no walks, and with his team making no errors) in modern major league history.<br>
He bridged the transition between old-style, 19th Century baseball, and the modern game. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937, just the second year it was opened.</p>
<p> Yes, there&rsquo;s no doubt that Satchel Paige was a great pitcher. But he never played in the major leagues on a regular basis. The reason notwithstanding, that is a fact. Making a totally emotional decision to re-name the annual best pitcher award for him, just because blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed into the majors until 1947, would be totally unacceptable. Let them establish some other award and name it after Paige, if they think his name has to be immortalized. </p>

		<p>This self-hating white sportswriter wants to eliminate the memory of the greatest pitcher in the history of baseball, for some Bantu who whined because he wasn&rsquo;t the first Bantu in the major leagues? That&rsquo;s beyond stupid. That would be like eliminating all references to Babe Ruth in favor of Pumpsie Green, notorious ONLY because he was the first Bantu on the LAST team to integrate, the Red Sox. </p>

		<p>No doubt this is a white writer. Probably trying to show other writers that he is more pc than they are. </p>
<p>Cy Young won more than 500 MLB games. A record that will be impossible to break. Paige, though a good pitcher had a career MLB record of 28 wins and 31 loses. So he won almost 500 games less than Cy Young. Granted Paige was denied access to the major leagues for most of his career, but even if he had played his whole career in the majors it is highly unlikely that he could have come close to Cy Youngs records. No one else ever has.  </p>

		<p>Paige&rsquo;s major league record is dismall. I think he only won 11 games ina year. <br>
   Paige was popular with the sportswriters. Like Muhammad Ali, he was constantly yapping, providing material for lazy sportswriters.<br>
   Cy Young is a role model for today&rsquo;s pitvhers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often heard sports announcers say things like: &#8220;People talk about Babe Ruth (or Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio, etc&hellip;) being the greatest, but they never batted against Satchel Paige.&#8221; Never have I heard anyone doubt Satchel Paige&rsquo;s greatness for not pitching against Babe Ruth. Why do you suppose that is?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t begrudge Satchel Paige any appreciation of his baseball skill, so why does Gordon Edes begrudge Cy Young? Does anyone really think that Mr. Edes would call for replacing the Satchel Paige Award with the name of a future pitcher who bested his records? The question answers itself.</p>

<p>How about if they name it the Jackie Robinson - Satchel Paige Award?  That way, it&rsquo;d be consistent with MLB&rsquo;s Jackie Robinson obsession.  I can barely watch MLB anymore.</p>

		<p>That Paige was not allowed to play MLB until well into the deep twilight of his career is indeed a sad injustice  And I think we can assume that he likely would have been a successful, perhaps even great, big league pitcher.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know these things for a fact.  And without that knowledge there is no justification for suddenly making the official judgment that Paige was the greatest pitcher of all time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a legend who provides endless speculation about how he would have done in he big leagues.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let it go at that. I believe Paige himself would have agreed with the status quo.</p>

		<p>Next up: all teams will be forced to retire Paige&rsquo;s number the way they were forced to retire Robinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Based on raw pitching ability, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Koufax" rel="nofollow">Sandy Koufax</a> was likely the greatest of all time. (Tough for a lifelong Dodger-hater to admit, but facts are facts.) Unfortunately, injuries cut his career short at age 30. Then there&rsquo;s Nolan Ryan and his 7 no-hitters 12 one-hitters and 18 two-hitters.. Assuming one is committed to renaming the award, either would be a far better choice than Paige.</p>

<p>How, exactly? By coming up with one-liners? Heck, Yogi Berra was better than anyone at that. I think that this sportswriter is embarking on a self-flagellating guilt trip, especially now that Obama is in the White House.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m one man that won&rsquo;t be along on that ride.</p>
<p>To Strider and Scott of the Arctic:</p>
<p>I agree with you fellas. Bug Selig&rsquo;s adoration of Jackie Robinson borders on necrophilia. But, to FORCE the rest of baseball to kowtow down to this  man&rsquo;s memory  is blasphemous idol-worship. </p>

		<p>Baseball can do what it wants   &mdash;   retire the numbers of all black players, rename all awards after blacks, name teams and stadiums after blacks   &mdash;   and they still won&rsquo;t attract black players in large numbers except for those who happen to be &#8220;Latino&#8221; imports who are also black.  Blacks prefer basketball and football, two sports where short bursts of speed and an ability to jump high are crucial to the sport, unlike baseball.</p>
