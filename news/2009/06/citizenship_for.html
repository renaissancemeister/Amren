<h1>Citizenship for Sale?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mariana Alvarado, Arizona Daily Star, June 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tucson Medical Center&rsquo;s &#8220;birth package&#8221; gives an official nod to a generations-old practice of wealthy Mexican women coming to U.S. hospitals to give birth. Mexican families do the same thing at all local hospitals, but TMC is the only one actively recruiting their business.</p>
<p>The practice is legal, but offensive to some advocates of tougher U.S. immigration standards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican consul general in Tucson said parents naturally want to give their children every advantage and securing U.S. citizenship is something a small percentage of Mexican families can afford.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Expectant mothers can either schedule a Caesarean section or arrive a few weeks before their due dates to give birth at TMC. It is one of 13 packages aimed at Mexican families, some of which include a stay at a local resort and shopping excursion.</p>
<p>TMC&rsquo;s maternity package costs $2,300 for a vaginal birth with a two-day stay and $4,600 for a Caesarean section and a four-day stay, assuming no complications. That includes exams for the newborn and a massage for the new mother. There is a $500 surcharge per additional child.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are families with a lot of money, and some (women) arrive on private jets and are picked up by an ambulance and brought here,&#8221; said Shawn Page, TMC&rsquo;s administrator of international services and relations. &#8220;These are families with a lot of clout.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. citizenship for their children brings even more clout: the opportunity  &mdash;  and right  &mdash;  to live, work and study in the United States. Because their parents do not earn the same right, many children of such arrangements grow up in Mexico and come here as adults for school and work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Array of packages</b></p>
<p>Aside from the maternity package, TMC offers 12 packages for international patients, including bone density tests, mammograms and urology procedures.</p>

		<p>If these Mexican families have so much &#8220;money&#8221; and &#8220;clout,&#8221; then why aren&rsquo;t they using those gifts to improve the living and medical situations in their own country?  </p>

		<p>The real problem here is the price is too low.  </p>
<p>Selling citizenship outright for a quarter to a half million dollars per head would solve about 99% of our immigration problem.  Yes, the odd Soros or Murdoch will get through, but those will under any system.  On the other hand, a poor up-and-comer like Andy Grove or Linus Torvalds could easily take out a mortgage or attract a sponsor.</p>

		<p>Where a benefit of U.S. citizenship is accrued, they should pay full market value. </p>
<p>Instead of just paying $2300 to the hospital, they should have to put up a figure based on the national worth of all the country&rsquo;s wealth and resources.   Once these are factored in, the figure for buying citizenship would be in the billions.  </p>
<p>Of course, there would be no takers, which is the intent.</p>

		<p>Although I am not condoning this practice it may not be as bad as it seems. As I live in latin america 3 months a year I may have a little different take on this. Most here assume that all mexicans are the dark skinned short fat ones we see everywhere we go. But the ones we see in the street are the bottom of the barrel. The are 2 classes in latin america, 90ish percent are the poor indians and a few rich. And a few very rich, think Carlos Slim. The rich are white, descendants of the spanish. They dont breed with the indians. Remember ex pres Vincete Fox, as white as any of us, and thats what the rich look like. They are the business owners and actually live in a fashion due to the cheap labor that not even rich americans can live exept a tiny few. All of them have chaufers and bodyguards, gardeners, maids ect. They live in houses any of us here would love to live in. I live in a upper class suburb of Medellin Colombia 3 months a year. Near where I live is a private school. These kids look exactly like american white kids and all speak perfect, and I mean perfect english. I know an american guy who teaches math there and he says 1/2 of the classes are in english and the other 1/2 are in spanish and even in french. These kids I beleive get a better, or at least as good an education as in any exclusive american school. Their families vacation in the USA or europe as they can easily get a visa and have the money to go first class. And we should be glad to take thier vacation dollars. <br>
   Once again, not condoning this practice but with my knowledge of latin america I am not as worried about the mexican rich coming here and certainly paying for, no freebies, and having all sorts of medical procedures. The mexican rich really are a different breed. Kingfish          </p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t really need any enemies when we have so many Americans working against their own country and their fellow citizens. Disgusting. Are there other hospitals that do this? This is on the level of the US schools who allow Mexican kids to come across the border to attend school. Seems there are traitors all over the country, not just confined to Washington.</p>

		<p>#7 Kingfish is right, we are actually being inundated by the indian types from Guatemala, Hondo, Salvadore, Nicaragua and other places we don&rsquo;t know their name. These indian types usually don&rsquo;t even speak Spanish as we know it. Wal-Martinez loves them. Heard Wal-Mart called that here on AR and I like and use it now. The Southerners here are starting to use it now.</p>
