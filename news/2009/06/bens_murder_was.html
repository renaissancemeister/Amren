			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rod Liddle, Times of London, June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Perhaps it will come as a vague consolation to the parents of Ben Kinsella that he was not murdered for racial reasons, but simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, as they say. Ben, aged 16, who was white, was stabbed to death by three black men near a nightclub in north London; there was no apparent motive for the murder.</p>
<p>If you were a cynic you might argue that if a black kid had been stabbed to death by three white men in an otherwise motiveless attack then the community centre would already have been built by now and the grieving parents recognised in the honours lists.</p>
<p>It is good that we are quick to become enraged by violent white racism, that it appals us and makes us examine our society, claw away in an attempt to discover those subterranean causes. But what of this, apparently, non-racist murder? Just as much brutal honesty is required to confront it, I think. Maybe more.</p>
<p>The truth is, violent white-on-black crime is a rarity in Britain, by comparison  &mdash;  although white-on-Asian crime is rather less so. The overwhelming bulk of violent street crime in London is committed by young black men, and in numerous cases against white people, although one would not impute a racial motive; the statistics suggest that young black male criminals are quite happy to stab or shoot anybody who hoves into view with either a bulging wallet, a mobile phone or an assumed reflection of disrespec&rsquo; in their eyes.</p>
<p>Apologies if this offends  &mdash;  but that&rsquo;s how it is. At most, the African Caribbean population of London is about 12% of the whole. But black males are responsible for nearly 60% of arrests for robbery  &mdash;  and the overwhelming majority of gun crime, most of it black-on-black violence.</p>
<p>We skirt this issue, mostly for decent, if deluding reasons  &mdash;  that a proportion of young black males is more likely to commit violent crime than other sectors of the population. It is a form of racism, though, to assume that the problem is simply a given, and unalterable  &mdash;  but we have been hamstrung in our attempts to deal with it for reasons of political correctness.</p>
<p>The propensity of some young black males to underachieve at school and later commit crimes of violence has been seen for too long as a roguish expression of cultural diversity, exacerbated by our own inherent racism and economic oppression; in other words, it&rsquo;s not their fault. Indeed the culture of violence, misogyny and epic drug abuse, exemplified in rap music, has been lapped up by a bovine liberal white culture that finds the vibrancy and &#8220;edginess&#8221; of gangsta rap something in which we should all exult and indeed emulate.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are reluctant to draw attention to the fatherless families in our black communities, the absence of male role models and teachers, even though we know that this is not a good thing, as we increasingly realise it is not a good thing for white boys either. We have been shy of condemning this demeaned culture for fear of being branded racist; too quick to make excuses when the education statistics arrive and show black males right down at the bottom, even below poor whites. But not black females, note; they do well at school and are high achievers later on too. This is only a racist thing if you make it a racist thing.</p>
<p>There is a horrible symmetry to the case of Ben Kinsella. He foresaw, in a school essay, that he might one day be stabbed to death in the street, although he was too nice a kid to suggest that the perpetrators would be black.</p>
<p>His assailants, meanwhile, quite incapable of writing an essay, had demonstrated their own commitment to the eventual murder by having previously been variously convicted of extreme, nihilistic violence, robbery and selling drugs. All parties were set on a trajectory which was to end in Ben&rsquo;s death. In his last moments, Ben asked of the young men wielding the knives why they had picked on him. No sentient answer was forthcoming, apparently.<br/>

		<p><i>Perhaps it will come as a vague consolation to the parents of Ben Kinsella that he was not murdered for racial reasons, but simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, as they say.</i></p>
<p>That phrase, &#8220;wrong place at the wrong time,&#8221; bothers me a whole lot.  I keep hearing it repeated, as a bromide or a canard.  Why are the victims of said crimes always said to be &#8220;in the wrong place at the wrong time?&#8221;  As if s/he did something wrong?  Why aren&rsquo;t the criminals said to be &#8220;in the wrong place at the wrong time,&#8221; and more importantly, doing the wrong thing?  I think it&rsquo;s a subtle attempt using linguistics and weasel words to transfer the blame, especially if the perp is black and victim is white.</p>
<p><i>At the same time, we are reluctant to draw attention to the fatherless families in our black communities, the absence of male role models and teachers, even though we know that this is not a good thing, as we increasingly realise it is not a good thing for white boys either.</i></p>
<p>Compare fatherless whites with fatherless blacks.  &#8216;Nuff said.</p>
<p>Also, I think these black children would be worse if their thug no good ne&rsquo;er-do-well gang banger fathers were around more often.  </p>
<p><i>There is a horrible symmetry to the case of Ben Kinsella. He foresaw, in a school essay, that he might one day be stabbed to death in the street, although he was too nice a kid to suggest that the perpetrators would be black.</i></p>
<p>No, he was too scared to suggest that.  Had he done that, he would have been strung up for hate, and some people at your newspaper would have been chomping the bit for his head.</p>

</i><p>&#8220;Not impute a racial <i>motive</i>&#8221;?  Who needs a &#8220;racial motive&#8221; except for &#8220;hate crime&#8221; foolery??  We have an identifiable, incontrovertible racial cause for most of the violent personal crime on Britain&rsquo;s streets: young black men.  Eliminate that cause, and who needs to worry about &#8220;motives,&#8221; especially since this gaping coddler has just explained that blacks barely have the mental capability to even <i>form</i> a motive for their bestial acts against others.</p></p>

Always the same excuse; the wrong place, the wrong time.</p>
<p>The wrong place and the wrong time is any place and any time a white person is around blacks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the video of the murder:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/mpkyge" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/mpkyge</a></p>
<p>Then we have the story of Chris Jones. Another boy (14 years old) in the wrong place (his own neighborhood) at the wrong time (when blacks were present). If you can bare to have your heart ripped open watching a mother and father talk about the savage and fatal beating of there son, here&rsquo;s an &#8216;interesting&rsquo; video:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the race of the victim in this one but this 65 year old man was in the wrong place at the wrong time as well; in this case, around hispanics:</p>

<p>60 percent of those arrested for robbery are black? If so, you can bet 80 percent or more of the robbers are black.</p>

Why would arguing that make anyone a &#8220;cynic&#8221;? It&rsquo;s the truth, so saying it would make you not a cynic but merely a REALIST. </p>
<p>Good article overall, fairly blunt for MSM. But it still stops short of saying what every AR reader knows: black crime and other pathologies are, first and foremost, a function of the lower black IQ. </p>
<p>If this writer continues to research this subject, he will inescapably come to this conclusion also. Whether or not he&rsquo;ll be brave enough to report it in The Times, well, that&rsquo;s another question altogether. </p>

		<p>This story is absolutely heartbreaking&hellip;wonder why we didn&rsquo;t hear a word about it here in the U.S(rhetorical question)&hellip;.but then, if it were not for websites like these, I wouldn&rsquo;t have heard the tragic story of Christopher Jones either. Both of these precious children were casualties of war. When will White people have had enough of watching their sons and daughters be brutally hunted down and murdered by these animals?</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not an unalterable problem at all.  Get rid of the blacks, and by your own statistics you&rsquo;ll get rid of most of your crime.  Problem solved.</p>

		<p>when I lived in New York City in the early 90s, there was quite a lot of talk about &#8220;violent youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>it was &#8220;violent youth&#8221; who clubbed my 90 year-old neighbor (the Admiral was well-known for his role on the prosecution team at the Nuremberg trials in Germany) - over the head in the lobby of our building. <br/>
which was next door to the residence of a university president. </p>
<p>for most people of means, not having a doorman building was tantamount to wandering around a minefield blindfolded at midnight. and the wealthy were carried around by private car services while the rest of us brave the subway.</p>
<p>of course we all knew that blacks were responsible for most of the crime in the city, but no one said it out loud.</p>
<p>only much later did I discover that the white majority in your city is responsible for 1% of the homicides, and blacks for more than 90%.</p>
<p>if I said this to any of my enlightened white (or nonwhite) friends when I lived there, they would probably have ended our friendship on the spot.</p>

		<p>Hate crime laws were created for the sole purpose of putting Whites, Christians, and males in jail, and to set free people who don&rsquo;t fit into those categories.<br/>
The words that set the non-White free are &#8220;no apparent motive.&#8221;<br/>
Funny, whenever it&rsquo;s a White who is accused, they seem to be able to find a motive real quick.</p>

		<p>This sort of crime is fundamentally a result of the never admitted fact that, due to the average low cognitive level (IQ) of Blacks they are just unable to cut it in modern technological cultures. They therefore gravitate to the lowest social-economic levels in society but with automatic anti-white animus due to having been constantly told that white racism is what&rsquo;s holding them down. They are literally educated to hate whites. </p>
<p>Racial diversity can work as a positive force only if the races are on the same level cognitively. Otherwise there&rsquo;s inevitable and persistent strife. This is why, frankly, I think the BNP is the only hope for such a small nation as Britain. They are at least halfway honest about race.</p>

		<p>Clearly the grasping tentacles of white racism have migrated from the America South to the previously racially blind British Isles.</p>
<p>How else to explain the criminal behavior of British black Africans, the tremendously lopsided prevalence of black on white crime?</p>
<p>Britain was always hailed as the most racially blind of Western nations.  Now, obviously, with the contamination by its close association with the US, it has become as virulently racist as America!  What we have sown they have reaped!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Britain has had the good sense to totally disarm its white citizenry to prevent them from defending themselves from the righteously marauding blacks.  They&rsquo;re only getting they&rsquo;re just deserts!</p>

		<p>Its funny. On another chat board I commented on how the post-war black presence in the U.K. had been such a bad thing for the British people. I was savaged in the replies and so many of them were White Britons too. I thought it was sad how brainwashed the native British had become. What&rsquo;s happened to Britain, is sad, tragic, even bizarre. There were never any blacks in Britain, no slavery or segregation and yet many of the Whites there are consumed with &#8220;White guilt&#8221; and self-hate. I just don&rsquo;t know&hellip;. </p>

		<p>Britain is a textbook case in how nations can choose to succeed or destroy themselves. In the British case &#8220;they&#8221; (the Marxist Labour party) chose the latter and the instrument used was massive non-White immigration. </p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s happened to Britain, is sad, tragic, even bizarre. There were never any blacks in Britain, no slavery or segregation and yet many of the Whites there are consumed with &ldquo;White guilt&rdquo; and self-hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s self-hate that made the Brits allow non-whites into their country in the first place.  Maybe they despise themselves for letting their empire slip away, &amp; their self-loathing took the form of guilt for the empire&rsquo;s various sins. Then they simply bought into the sylish nonsense about other cultures being &#8220;vibrant&#8221; and &#8220;rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve puzzled over it &amp; that&rsquo;s the best this non-historian can do. </p>

		<p>The white victim was not &ldquo;in the wrong place at the wrong time&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just that the blacks in England are in the wrong country at the wrong time.</p>
<p>#17 Madison..don&rsquo;t say that!! you KNOW how our politicians love to import black criminals to the U.S.<br/>
