<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D98VP85G1&amp;show_article=1">Sarkozy Says Burqas Are &#8216;Not Welcome&rsquo; in France</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy lashed out Monday at the practice of wearing the Muslim burqa, insisting the full-body religious gown is a sign of the &#8220;debasement&#8221; of women and that it won&rsquo;t be welcome in France.</p>
<p>The French leader expressed support for a recent call by dozens of legislators to create a parliamentary commission to study a small but growing trend of wearing the full-body garment in France.</p>
<p>In the first presidential address in 136 years to a joint session of France&rsquo;s two houses of parliament, Sarkozy laid out his support for a ban even before the panel has been approved  &mdash;  braving critics who fear the issue is a marginal one and could stigmatize Muslims in France.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The burqa is not a religious sign, it&rsquo;s a sign of subservience, a sign of debasement  &mdash;  I want to say it solemnly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will not be welcome on the territory of the French Republic.&#8221;</p>
<p>In France, the terms &#8220;burqa&#8221; and &#8220;niqab&#8221; often are used interchangeably. The former refers to a full-body covering worn largely in Afghanistan with only a mesh screen over the eyes, whereas the latter is a full-body veil, often in black, with slits for the eyes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France enacted a law in 2004 banning the Islamic headscarf and other conspicuous religious symbols from public schools, sparking fierce debate at home and abroad. France has Western Europe&rsquo;s largest Muslim population, an estimated 5 million people.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said Friday that it would seek to set up a parliamentary commission that could propose legislation aimed at barring Muslim women from wearing the head-to-toe gowns outside the home.</p>

		<p>I am delighted that the unwanted, unneeded, culturally incompatible Muslims cling to their medieval attire.  It makes them stand out in a crowd and as such it will make them much easier to target once Westerners have decided to cleanse their nations of the dangerous and hostile Islamic presence&hellip; </p>

		<p>This is focusing on the splinter and ignoring the beam. Sarkozy has previously stated that Arabic is the language of science and miscegenation (race mixing) is the only hope for the survival of France. We here in America have a neurotic, excessive focus on race, in France there is neurotic, excessive focus on religion. Any expression of faith in a public place is seen as a violation of church and state, and it is in that frame of reference that the debate over the burqa is held. That is the splinter. The beam is the fact that no one is willing to (or even allowed to, for that matter) to shine a much needed harsh light on Islam and Muslims, that Muslims will be a majority in France by the end of the century, and that Muslims are already attempting to impose their law and social customs on Europeans. But there is no chance that Sarkozy will ever address that, and even if he succeeds in banning the burqa now it won&rsquo;t matter in a few decades when Muslims are numerous enough to force the burqa on non Muslim women.</p>

		<p>Sarkozy wants the white Frenchmen and non-white immigrants to jump into his melting pot. His recipe is one of integration, miscegenation, and assimilation.  He&rsquo;ll oppose French nationalists just as quickly as burqa-wearing Muslims.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care about the white race; as long as the financial status quo is undisturbed, he doesn&rsquo;t care if France goes  ethnically African or Muslim. </p>

		<p>He doesn&rsquo;t like the burquas.  But he has no problem importing the race and culture that demands burquas.  I think it would be easier to deport said culture and not let it into France in the first place than dealing with the imbrogliana when they&rsquo;re already in France.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;The burqa is not a religious sign, it&rsquo;s a sign of subservience, a sign of debasement&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Exactly. If the late Rev. Falwell or Pat Robertson said that Christian women should wear certain clothing, they would have been crucified.</p>
<p>When this issue comes up, I always ask, where are the feminists speaking out about this sexist servitude? Have you ever heard a feminist speak on this issue?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that feminists are only interested in dismantling Christianity; ironically, one religion that exults a women, Mary. Every other religion, regardless of how it debases women, is left alone.<br>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the enrichment they keep telling us about? And next up, the President will be forced to apologize heavily on the grounds of religious discrimination, possibility fined and he might be forced to resign in disgrace will he&rsquo;s at it. In the meantime the rioting and violence will begin with the burning of cars in the city! <br>

		<p>Sarcozy wasnt tough enough.<br>
Bt saying &#8221; the Muslim religion must be respected&#8221;<br>
rather than saying &#8220;there is a FRENCH WAY OF LIFE AND CULTURE and anyone living in France must follow that FIRST AND FOREMOST rather than hiding being &#8220;the excuse of religious liberty to justify the oppression of woman.</p>
<p>The burdern shouldnt be on French civilization to somehow change to accomadate Islam.<br>
Rather the burden is on those who practice Islam to follow the high standards of French Civilization and the French way of life and culture and only allow a form of Islam that accepts woman as equal and not subservient wearing the burka.<br>

		<p>That there are five million muslims in France is of no concern to Sarkozy.  If only muslims women would stop wearing burqas, they would all turn French.  When the muslims finally take over Europe, I hope they declare a fatwa requiring Sarkozy to wear a burqa.</p>

<p>Want to wear a burqa?  Fine, go ahead.  But don&rsquo;t be surprised if you stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>I also live near the Amish, who dress rather differently.  Doesn&rsquo;t bother me.  But I&rsquo;m wondering how people can stand wearing long sleeves in hot weather.</p>

		<p>Government has no business telling people what they should wear and what they should not wear.  The business of government is to protect their nation from invasion.  If they&rsquo;d expel the invaders from France, then petty issues like fashion would solve themselves.</p>

		<p> Dear Fariq Al-Aslan Rumi, please tell me (I am genuinely interested in your answer) why so many Muslims opt to leave their own culture and live in the alien West. Is it:</p>
<p>1. because they hope to one day conquer us by demographics?</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>2. because life in the West is infinitely preferable to life in any Islamic country?</p>
<p>We Australians frequently ask the Muslims here the same question, but alas, we have yet to receive an answer that makes sense. Perhaps you can enlighten us. For all your talk about the wonders of Islam, I suspect that 2. is the answer.</p>

		<p>I must go out on a limb here, and in the name of personal liberty defend the right of the individual to wear any costume that they choose, free from the tyranny of government interference.To accept the idea of a western, so-called &#8216;liberal&rsquo; government to regulate one&rsquo;s clothing sets a very danderous precedent.<br>
   Saying all that, it&rsquo;s good to get a dig in to that horrible hypcrite Sarkozy.The point is this - If you import an alien people, you import alien ways - there&rsquo;s no two ways about it, it&rsquo;s a price the french must pay for accepting an alien people in their midst in the first place, and of course Sarkozy will defend to the death the &#8216;right&rsquo; of muslims to settle in France.<br>

<p>How utterly untrue. Christianity has never sought to promote the rights of women. It DOES exalt the Virgin Mary, but a quick glance at the 11-18th century would tell you that women in Europe still needed a dowry to be wed, still were prejudiced against, and were prosecuted for being promiscuous or dressed in an &#8220;unbecoming&#8221; way (even when not married). That said, the granting of rights to women were CHRISTIAN, but by no means was their CHRISTIANITY involved (e.g. Lady Lovelace et al.)</p>
<p>That said, Sarkozy&rsquo;s doing something right, in a world in which a sense of righteousness has been blinded. Do not criticise him for all the thing he&rsquo;s DONE. Judge his actions independently and not in relation of one another. Otherwise, we&rsquo;d never recognise any merit.</p>

<p><br>
Dear Muslim troll: A people cannot be a &#8220;morality.&#8221; There can be no such thing as &#8220;the excellence.&#8221; And it&rsquo;s not possible to &#8220;holocaust them&#8221; because holocaust is not a verb. </p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve dealt with your inferior grasp of the white man&rsquo;s language, I&rsquo;ll deal with the dissembling content of your post: </p>
<p>The fact that you take a cliche about the Nazis&rsquo; extermination of European Jewry   &mdash;   which FTR did actually happen, despite what your imam probably tells you every Friday afternoon   &mdash;   and apply it to the wearing of the ridiculous and debasing Islamic fundamentalist garment called the burqa, demonstrates the Islamic principle of &#8220;taqqiya&#8221; in action. </p>
<p>Taqqiya   &mdash;   which permits Muslims to lie and to deceive non-Muslims as long as the lie helps promote Islam   &mdash;   is Islam&rsquo;s secret weapon in the West. Taqqiya can justify ANY subterfuge against the Infidel so long as it increases Muslim power and decreases Infidel power. </p>
<p>For Muslims like this Fariq Al-Aslan Rumi, the Jewish holocaust only happened if it provides an opportunity for them to guilt-trip silly white Infidels   &mdash;   like Sarkozy, who despite his anti-burqa stance, is not a true friend to the white Christian people of France   &mdash;   into having yet more Islam forced upon them. </p>
<p>Remember: Muslims can   &mdash;   and WILL   &mdash;   lie to you about the true aims of their religion. Their religion TELLS them to do this. No Muslim talking to an Infidel should be presumed to be telling the truth, no matter how sincere or how sensible they might sound. In short: THEY CAN&rsquo;T BE TRUSTED. </p>

<p>Whites of European descent are not running amuck in Middle Eastern countries that are predominately Muslim.  1) They don&rsquo;t want to and 2) It would not be tolerated by the Muslims, and if it did I would not blame Muslims for not tolerating it. I believe most whites would agree. White societies have constantly tolerated non-white societies to impinge on there territory in hopes that non-white societies would assimilate and contribute. Time after time this has proven to be wishful thinking. How much longer will it take for whites of European descent to realize that the so called &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; is nothing more than a &ldquo;cooking pot&rdquo; exclusively for whites?</p>

<p>Right you are, it is worth 20+ years in a muslim prison for prosylitizing. An incident a few years ago in Kuwait had a Catholic priest arrested for just that, it took the POPE!! and promise that the priest would NEVER AGAIN ENTER MUSLIM LAND or the 20 year sentence would be imposed immediately.</p>

The truth of the matter is that Sarkozy&rsquo;s anti-burqua proposal is born of the same kind of environmental (i.e. not ecological) determinism and egalitarianism as are &#8220;progressive&#8221; French (and other countries&rsquo;) loose and open immigration system.  Banning the burqua is simply &#8220;fighting gender intolerance,&#8221; just as open borders is &#8220;fighting racial intolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flaw in the scheme is that French Muslim women won&rsquo;t turn into NOW members overnight if the burqua is banned, if at all.</p>
<p>In some U.S. states, it is illegal to appear in public with one&rsquo;s facial identity fully concealed.</p>

		<p>Those who are applauding Sarkozy for this have it all wrong, I&rsquo;m afraid.  The impulse for this proposed law has nothing to do with loyalty to traditional European values, but rather to modern Leftist morality legislation (no, it&rsquo;s not a contradiction in terms).  </p>
<p>That is, feminists and others on the left advocate for laws to restrict the rights of women on the basis of &#8220;protecting them from oppression.&#8221;  Which is basically a paternalistic attitude, something apparently lost on the feminists.  The assumption seems to be that the women wearing the burqa could not possibly be doing so out of their free choice, so the state will enter the picture and force them to make the right &#8220;choice.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happily opposed to any kind of morality legislation, either from the right or the left, but at least the right is somewhat honest with itself about what it&rsquo;s doing. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a joke for my fellow Amrenners:</p>
<p>How can you spot a Muslim prostitute?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the one wearing a fishnet burqa.</p>

		<p>The whole burka law is kind of silly in my opinion. I think it simply masks the problem. It would be better to allow the full burka in France so the French people can see what they are buying if they choose Islam and how repressive it is. Instead of banning the burka, they should ban immigration and reach into their roots building up their country.</p>

		<p> there are some states in america where it is illegal to wear a mask. (halloween being the exception) i wonder if they would enforce the law or not because it would be culturally insensitive?</p>

<p>The main reason why such laws were passed was because of a certain group that used sheets.  The authorities figured that it would be better off if the world could see faces.  The crucial thing to remember is that many of these laws were passed in Southern states in the pre-WWII years, by many of the same people who countenanced segregation. Which belies the notion that there were huge injustices against blacks, and that the segregationist system was an example.</p>
