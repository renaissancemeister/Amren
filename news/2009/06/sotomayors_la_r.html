<h1>Sotomayor&rsquo;s La Raza Uses Taxpayer Money for Radical Agenda</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert M. Engstrom, Human Events, June 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If a group of United States citizens trekked to another country, formed an organization called &#8220;The Race,&#8221; which demanded open borders, unfettered immigration and citizenship, billions of dollars for bilingual education, health care, housing, job and wage guarantees, and anti-discrimination protection, they would likely soon be jailed or deported in a display of righteous sovereign indignation. But the National Council of La Raza engages in all these activities in the United States, and it receives taxpayer dollars to help promote its radical views. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>La Raza, founded in 1968 by Raul Yzaguirre, takes its name from &#8220;La Raza Cosmica,&#8221; a phrase coined by Mexican scholar Jose Vasconcelos. The English translation, and the first definition found in Spanish/English dictionaries, for &#8220;la raza&#8221; is &#8220;the race.&#8221;  Contrary to La Raza&rsquo;s contention that the phrase means &#8220;the people,&#8221; or &#8220;the community,&#8221; the Spanish for those phrases are &#8220;la gente,&#8221; and &#8220;la comunidad.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 2005, La Raza received $15.2 million in federal grant money for charter schools and get-out-the-vote campaigns and in 2006 got another $4 million in congressional earmarks for housing reform. The organization&rsquo;s financial statements for 2008 show that it received another $5.1 million in federal grants, and holds assets worth $97.4 million. La Raza has received more than $30 million from the federal government since 1996. </p>
<p>The Council of La Raza arranged to have its voice included in congressional hearings by House and Senate leaders and garnered an extra $4 million in federal tax funds earmarked by an anonymous senator in 2007 while continuing to lobby for open borders, driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegals, and amnesty leading to citizenship for all illegal immigrants in the country.</p>
<p>Many of Mexico&rsquo;s leading politicians encourage the takeover of sovereign U.S. property, and La Raza encourages those statements, while offering advice about avoiding the terms &#8220;illegals&#8221; and &#8220;amnesty.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>La Raza endorsed the 2007 Citizenship Promotion Act, introduced by then-Sen. Barack Obama. The purpose of this act was to limit the costs of applying to become a citizen of the United States, but another provision of the bill would have distributed $80 million to pro-illegal immigration organizations, some of which are suspected of having links to the Mexican government. </p>
<p>In the name of diversity, La Raza encourages Latinos to cling to the language and customs of their home country after becoming citizens of the U.S. Those not &#8220;brown enough&#8221; are derided, as was Linda Chavez when she was considered for the position of Labor secretary under President George W. Bush. Rather than taking pride in the accomplishments of a female of Hispanic descent, critics mocked her as &#8220;the Hispanic who doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish.&#8221; While Chavez was under fire, the National Hispanic Leadership Association, an umbrella group representing 40 different Hispanic groups, including La Raza, condemned the federal Office of Personnel Management for failing to promote and hire Hispanics. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>La Raza, through a network of 300 affiliates in 41 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, says that it &#8220;advocates on behalf of the entire Latino population regardless of immigration status.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Even though La Raza received this money not for political purposes, it helped La Raza to promulgate its political agenda.  Because these are fungible contributions, in that it frees up money that La Raza would have had to spend on education, housing, etc. to use for lobbying and agitation.</p>

		<p>It is time for white racialist groups to demand some tax moolah from Uncle Sucker,just the same way the La Razists do. New Century Foundation, Council of Conservative Citizens,Vdare, etc. I am serious. If they are denied funds, at least maybe the moolah can be cut off from the Mexupremacists based on us being denied.New Century, give it a go!</p>

		<p>The situation continues to worsen and will do so before we are able to see anything favorable for our side.</p>
<p>We should all be silently hoping for economic collapse so that funds are not available for these groups, which includes blacks and others, and that it will put us in a better position to assume territory that can secede from this disintegrating empire.</p>
<p>At that time we will need adequate supplies and defensive arms to repel any attacks aimed at stealing our provisions.</p>
<p>We only have about two to three more years to prepare.  I hope white people are taking this seriously.</p>

		<p>La Raza teaches that that the whole southwest area (8 states) of the U.S belongs to Mexico. They call this area &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; and it MUST be surrended (&#8220;reconquista&#8221;) to La Raza.  Once this is achieved, the current borders of these states will simply disappear.   The final plan of the La Raza movement includes the ethnic cleansing of Americans of European, African, and Asian decent out of Aztlan. It other words, all non-Chicanos and opposition groups  would would have to be expelled. </p>
<p>Supreme Court nominee Sotomayor is a self-professed advocate of La Raza and obviously buys into its goals.</p>
<p>She also believes in amnesty, abortion and is against capital punishment.  Do you believe that this woman believes in fair treatment for all   &mdash;  -believes in Lady Justice&rsquo;s blindfold?  If you do, I have a bridge to sell.   </p>
<p>Do you think that this person should receive a life-time appointment to the highest court in the land?  I don&rsquo;t!</p>

Factor in all the grants, contributions by charitable trusts, and the extortion money paid by corporations to stay on good terms with Hispanics and &#8220;The Race&#8221; is making a killing.</p>

		<p>Political money collusion may be illegal..Guess it is same as illegal aliens. Any illegal activity is OK as long as politicians approve. Looks like the country of laws is also the country lacking law enforcement. Depends upon who is distributing the funds. Little folks like me would go to jail for a few dollars while the politicians give away millions we pay in taxes to fund those who would destroy the country for their race/ethnic group.  Whites need to get organized &amp; activated to stop the redistribution or to prosecute.  I think this is unethical and against political campaign funding.       V</p>

		<p>The long-suffering (mostly white) American worker continues to cop it.<br>
Every single White American should be entitled to know where the yearly proportion of their tax (extortion) money goes. Giving a group such as &#8216;La Raza&rsquo; one single cent is completely wrong!</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time for white racialist groups to demand some tax moolah from Uncle Sucker,just the same way the La Razists do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only American tax payers&rsquo; money that would be used for white racialist groups would be the cost of keeping them in jail after the odd &#8216;hate-speech&rsquo; conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Century Foundation, Council of Conservative Citizens,Vdare, etc. I am serious. If they are denied funds, at least maybe the moolah can be cut off from the Mexupremacists based on us being denied.New Century, give it a go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not? Seriously, does anyone know whether any such organisations HAVE applied?</p>

		<p>Many former Californians like me will recall the early La Raza speeches where they predicted their intention for a &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; of California and the Southwest and their intention to use any means to do so. They used AA and other official complaint avenues to push their way into middle management positions in State and local governments until they made it disfunction enough to allow for example, the California DMV to condone cheating on license tests by illegals right under the nose of DMV workers.  Of course they consulted with Spanish speaking Hispanic workers as the White ones ignored the situation.  I saw it over and over whenever I was at a DMV office.  This type of thing went on everywhere.  Fraud in personal injury claims were so high in California that I had to quit working at my profession there lest I take part of it thgough my employment.  Yes, I had to voluntarily &#8220;retire&#8221; in order to avoid taking part in illegal activities.  Hispanic gangs had already taken care of my own private practice by burglary and vandalization.  But the trend toward this has spread nearly everywhere now. </p>
<p>Now they use the cloak of Diversity as one of their tools as if they really want to be part of any community aside from their own expanding one.    There is no hope that a Hispanic dominated USA will be any more successful than Mexico or any other Latin American country anyone might care to name.</p>
<p>BHO seems set to create a very liberal Immigration Reform Act that will allow only more of them into our already struggling nation.  The national goal seems to have become unofficially but obviously a drive to disenfranchise every remaining White controlled or dominated department, office, public entity or issue regardless of the cost.  One has to wonder how much more money this administration will spend trying to prevent Black and Hispanic high school drop out rates.  But in order to fix the stats, Whites must be prevented from succeeding.  The result will be the collapse of our nation.  That will be when the real fun begins.</p>

<p>Since illegal aliens can get drivers&rsquo; licenses, what is to prevent them from registering to vote and actually voting?  The same La Raza mentality that runs the DMV also runs the election canvassing boards; they&rsquo;re sure not going to tell a fellow Hispanic no.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 3 million illegal aliens voted in the November 2000 Presidential election.  It was probably higher last year.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight#12, thank you so much for refreshing my memory on La Raza&rsquo;s history. I remember how these subversives regularly spewed forth the messages of brown power and reconquista at various gatherings in the early 70&rsquo;s. You also reminded me of the cheating at the various Southern California DMV offices. I believe that more than thirty DMV offices were busted at one point for allowing cheating on tests and for selling phony drivers licenses or car registrations. This is the kind of stuff people in other states, not yet inundated with millions of illegal aliens, simply do not hear about.</p>
