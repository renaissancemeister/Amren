<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/education/15stamford.html?_r=2">No Longer Letting Scores Separate Pupils</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Winnie Hu, New York Times, June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sixth graders at Cloonan Middle School here are assigned numbers based on their previous year&rsquo;s standardized test scores  &mdash;  zeros indicate the highest performers, ones the middle, twos the lowest  &mdash;  that determine their academic classes for the next three years.</p>
<p>But this longstanding system for tracking children by academic ability for more effective teaching evolved into an uncomfortable caste system in which students were largely segregated by race and socioeconomic background, both inside and outside classrooms. Black and Hispanic students, for example, make up 46 percent of this year&rsquo;s sixth grade, but are 78 percent of the twos and 7 percent of the zeros.</p>
<p>So in an unusual experiment, Cloonan mixed up its sixth-grade science and social studies classes last month, combining zeros and ones with twos. These mixed-ability classes have reported fewer behavior problems and better grades for struggling students, but have also drawn complaints of boredom from some high-performing students who say they are not learning as much.</p>

		<p>  This is not an unusual experiment -just a repeat of No Child Left Behind or No Smart Child Allowed to Advance.<br>
  It is one of the major reasons that the USA is behind most other industrialized countries in skills. Teaching to the slowest is a disaster.<br>
  I my opinion complaints should be followed by law suits for failing to teach the smartest children and wasting national talent.</p>

		<p>This is just more postive proof that white parents should do everything in their power to relocate to an all white area or to home school their kids.</p>
<p>There will be no end to manipulations that favor blacks.</p>
<p>Let the white geeks who come up with these hare-brained ideas try to teach a school that is all black.  It&rsquo;s what they deserve.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;But Joel Castle, who is 12 and a zero, said that he did not work as hard now. &ldquo;My grades are going up, and that&rsquo;s not really surprising because the standards have been lowered,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you love the way they label the smartest kids &#8216;zeros&rsquo;? I&rsquo;ll bet this was done to give the dumber kids something to taunt the smarter kids with so they could lower their self-esteem and motivation. I wonder if any of the white parents protested this nomenclature. YOU KNOW if black kids were labeled &#8216;zero&rsquo;, there would be a race war and EVERYONE involved would have been fired.</p>
<p>And notice how this &#8216;zero&rsquo; is keenly aware that his course load is being dumbed down. He ain&rsquo;t stupid (like his classmates).</p>

		<p>If Thomas Edison would have spent more time, money and resources on light bulb designs that didn&rsquo;t work than ones that did, you would be in the dark this evening.</p>
<p>If the Wright Brothers had worked on planes that didn&rsquo;t fly than ones that did, you&rsquo;d still need three days to get from NY to London on the ocean.</p>
<p>Where is this logic when it comes to education?</p>
<p>If the grades of the &#8220;struggling&#8221; students are increasing when they&rsquo;re in a higher track, it&rsquo;s because the smart kids are pretty much doing the tests.</p>

		<p>That social engineering idiot should experiment with his piece which was born with him, and not with childrens education.</p>
<p>I have heared about several such forced experiments in the primary and secondary schools where I went in the past with very bad results. (our minority population is called the &#8220;roma&#8221;=gipsy (of course they have nothing to do with the same-named city)) </p>
<p>The gipsy children are as bad as ever, or even worse, and now the more disciplined white kids have difficulties to learn mainly because discipline problems in the classroom.</p>
<p>Yust think of it:<br>
If the class consists of average and above average talented and well disciplined children, the learning pace can be very high and effective.</p>
<p>BUT if you mix only as few as 2 or 3 children with bad behaviour into the classroom, they can really block the education. </p>
<p>For those of you who have guts.:</p>
<p>gipy children of a primary school class are bullying a national hearted girl (who has the a national coloured pullover on)<br>
AND white children are standing next to them without helping, just laughing&hellip;</p>

		<p>Oldman is right.  Nothing new here.  This is just forcing the smarter kids to wait for the slower kids.    This has been going for many years now. Entire generations of white kids are sacrificed in the name of equality.</p>
<p>What is ironic is that during the Supreme Court debate in Brown v. Board this type of scenario was addressed and the Justices were assured by Thorougood Marshal that race would not be a factor in making decisions.  B v. B was argued to remove any race consideration.  Forced busing and now forced outcome of results was invented in the 70s and 80s. </p>

There is no doubt, in my mind, that boredom is among the least of their problems.

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the dysfunctional minorities for this one.  Compulsory public education is the creation of the philosophical forebears of today&rsquo;s marxists, the New England Puritans.  Thomas Sowell discussed this intellectual pedigree in several of his books, most notably, &#8220;A Conflict of Visions&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The free market is perfectly capable of providing whatever educational services parents require.  A separation of school and government would put an end to others using our children for jobs program and social experiments.  </p>

		<p>From QD:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Where is this logic when it comes to education?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been sanity or logic in the educational-industrial complex for 40 long years.  Smart kids are thrown under the bus, sacrificial lambs on the altar of diversity  &mdash;  does this not tell you something about the main goals of the educational system?</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve posted before, the government-controlled system is first a make-work job corps for NAMs with college degrees, especially black PhDs, and second to indoctrinate White children to feel guilty for all the evil of the world and brainwash them into accepting a Freudo-Marxist New World Order with Whites on the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p>From Istvan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I wonder what the brighter kids will do today while waiting for the slower kids to catch up?..&#8221;</p>
<p>They do one of two things  &mdash;  drugs, and I&rsquo;m not kidding, or they drop out of a system that continually scorns, mocks and debases them and elevates NAMs at their expense.</p>

		<p>Liberals don&rsquo;t send their kids to public schools. They send their kids to expensive elite private schools. </p>
<p>Who do the liberals hate the most? Working class whites. Liberals want a caste system where they are on top and let a few token minorities share the spotlight so they can bask in their phony moral elitism.</p>
<p>If bright whites from non-elite background (and there are lots and lots of these) get screwed in the process, all the better. Less competition for the elite white liberals, who probably realize they are not quite as smart or gifted as they say they are. </p>
<p>Take away all the expensive SAT Prep courses, summer programs, after school tutoring, and country club networking, and not a small number of these liberal elite brats would be exposed for the mediocrities they really are. </p>

		<p>In all areas where there are significant numbers of blacks in the school district the middle class mostly abandons the public school system precisely because they know (though they don&rsquo;t say it) that  their kids would be sacrificed for the benefit of the lower achieving and more disruptive &amp; violent black kids. Notice where our politicians send their precious kids to get an education.</p>
<p> Mixing poor performing students (mostly black) with relatively high performing students (usually white &amp; Asian) will benefit blacks but hampers the rest academically, otherwise you would see white or black parents clamoring to have their bright kids mixed in with the slow kids - but you don&rsquo;t ever see that, just the opposite. Studies that claim to show the ill effects of tracking are so bad, illogical and are simply politically correct propaganda. Any researcher who actually does a good statistical study of the effects on higher performing white kids of mixing (instead of tracking) would be asking for big trouble &amp; grief.  </p>
<p>The children of white lower &amp; working classes left in the middle class abandoned public schools just don&rsquo;t count as much for the sell-out (white) politicians &amp; educators. They don&rsquo;t want to deal with an angry black power structure (there no real white power structure because whites stupidly won&rsquo;t allow themselves white consciousness)if they maintain ability tracking. It&rsquo;s easier to pay lip service to the wonders of diversity. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bon: I think I read somewhere recently that the dropout rate in Los Angeles for both Whites and Orientals are over 1/3. Is that true?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fellow Traveller:</p>
<p>It was not easy to find these statistics because in LA, Whites do not exist (except to pay heavy taxes and be objects of ridicule a la that idiot letterman), White children even less so.  Fortunately, Whites are getting this message and are pulling their children out of the indoctrination gulag for homeschooling.  Plus, they&rsquo;re tired of their kids getting beaten up and robbed every day by violent NAMs and the schools doing absolutely nothing about it.</p>
<p><br>
And, from the looks of my son&rsquo;s homeschooling cohort, Asians are pulling their kids out as well  &mdash;  and who can blame them?  I believe it is the Asians who are losing the most in the current PC madness  &mdash;  held back by low IQd NAMs, forced into mainstreamed classes where they&rsquo;re used as tutors, or even as the teacher.  I have also seen then mercilessly terrorized in school hallways.  I remember telling one Vietnamese family to get their small, slight (highly intelligent) son out NOW.</p>
<p>Asians, along with forming advocacy groups for their people, are also opening their own &#8216;language&rsquo;-themed schools around here so Chinese kids can go to Chinese schools, Koreans, etc.  Can&rsquo;t say I blame them, watching out for their own people as they&rsquo;re starting to do.  Asian kids also band together in gangs  &mdash;  some specializing in home invasion robberies and other forms of criminal violence.</p>
<p>They are fortunate in that they can use their language-based schools to keep out undesirables  &mdash;  and, keep their &#8216;culture&rsquo; at the same time.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we Whites need to do  &mdash;  form powerful advocacy groups that will watch out for our people and open schools that cater to the learning styles of our children  &mdash;  just as every other group seems to be doing.  If the hostile elite want to call us Nazis and claim we are organizing a rise of the Fourth Reich  &mdash;  let them.</p>
<p>As someone once posted on here  &mdash;  we need more powerful lawyers named Smith and Jones to forcefully fight for us in court.</p>
<p>To answer your query, I found this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A quarter of the white kids called it quits. And leave it to L.A. Unified to accomplish the impossible: The dropout rate for Asian students is up 40 percent! That&rsquo;s not a typo&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/lxu7e2</p>
<p>Knowing as I do how the school districts cook the books when it comes to test scores and drop-out rates, I suspect these numbers are much higher for Whites.</p>
<p>How could any White kid sit and repeatedly listen to how HE, because he is White, is responsible for all the ills of the world, while NAMs with half his intelligence win all the accolades, awards and scholarships?</p>
