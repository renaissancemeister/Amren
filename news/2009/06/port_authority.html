<h1><a href="https://www.postgazette.com/pg/09168/977829-147.stm">Port Authority Worker Fired After Claiming Racial Incident</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jon Schmitz, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Port Authority service worker who claimed she was the target of a racial threat in 2007 has been fired after the authority concluded that she was involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Deborah Blocker, 48, who worked at the East Liberty garage, was dismissed June 9 for &#8220;prior knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;participation&#8221; in an Oct. 1, 2007, incident in which a black baby doll, bearing a racial epithet directed at an unspecified black woman, was found hanging in an employee-only area, according to her termination letter.</p>
<p>Ms. Blocker had been on paid leave for more than a year before her firing. She said yesterday that the allegation is baseless and that she will fight to reclaim her job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another service person at the garage, Tamara Clark, was fired in October in connection with the incident and is trying to win reinstatement through arbitration.</p>
<p>After the doll was found, police took handwriting samples and questioned employees and a Port Authority official said that criminal charges would be filed if the investigation identified the persons responsible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. McMahon [Patrick McMahon, president and business agent of Local 85, Amalgamated Transit Union] said both Ms. Blocker and Ms. Clark were escorted off the garage premises in March 2008 and held out of work, but continued to collect their salaries.</p>
<p>Ms. Clark was paid for about seven months to stay home and Ms. Blocker nearly 15 months before they were fired. Ms. Clark&rsquo;s wage at termination was $23.24 an hour; Ms. Blocker&rsquo;s was $23.94, according to the Port Authority.</p>

		<p>The hate crime hoaxer should be charged with a hate crime against white people. But I won&rsquo;t hold my breath! And the FBI should force the hoaxer to pay them for wasting their time - which means reimbursing the taxpayer.</p>

		<p>What did they expect out of them when they elected to hire them?</p>
<p>I mean, and employer statistically is going to have to weight the fact that black employees are 10 times more likely to do something criminal or wrong than white ones.</p>
<p>If businesses can afford the losses and/or the law suits, then it won&rsquo;t matter much, but if they can&rsquo;t, the problems caused by blacks will sink them.  I imagine this is why businesses would rather hire mestizos than blacks if no white workers are available.</p>

Indeed, and for all those extra months of pay they received while staying home and doing nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, criminal charges should be filed as well   &mdash;   for falesely reporting a crime and perpetrating a malicious hoax.</p>
<p>As it is, they&rsquo;ve gotten off very easily by just being fired, while they&rsquo;re allowed to keep the loot.</p>

		<p> My guess is this: Both women are guilty as suspected; both are lying; and they did it for the same reason that blacks often in the past have pulled such tricks: They think they&rsquo;ll ultimately get some benefit out of it   &mdash;   like a big settlement of some kind for &#8220;pain and suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p> I can see laying these women off with pay until an investigation establishes guilt or innocence, but I can&rsquo;t see continuing to pay them for seven months and 15 months, respectively, for doing absolutely nothing for the city of Pittsburgh for all that time. Just how long should it take to conduct such an investigation? Seven months would be a stretch, let alone 15.</p>

<p>They were paid to stay at home and do nothing, I would rather that than pay them to come to work and bother people DOING  WORK all day. I see the only likely lawsuit being the one who was paid only 7 months suing for equal treatment as the one paid for 15 months.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad they fired the racist black woman.  I hope they hire an oppressed white male to replace her.  That would truly be justice.  It looks like we do get some justice for our people every now and then.  Great!</p>

		<p>Their actions come as no surprise to me, just doing what they do.</p>
<p>What does surprise me is the outrageous hourly wage they recieve.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know exactly what a &#8220;service person&#8221; does but I do know that in pittsburgh the average hourly wage in pittsburgh for unskilled work in the private sector is about $10.00 p/h.</p>
<p>For these &#8220;service persons&#8221; to be paid almost $25.00 p/h on the taxpayers dime is outrageous. What with the Port Authority deeply in debt and running at a loss, ever increasing fares and declining services who do they think they are paying blue collar workers with no specific job description that kind of money? I don&rsquo;t even want to know what senior management are paid.</p>
<p>I think i&rsquo;ve just solved the Port Authorities financial crisis. Fire all union employees and invite them to reapply for their jobs at drastically reduced pay. Sounds tough but as an overtaxed underpaid Pittsburgh resident I believe I have a right to suggest this.</p>
<p>And some proper fare enforcement would be nice too instead of just eating the losses and passing them on to your paying customers, without whom your whole corrupt gravy train would come crashing down around you.</p>

		<p>Keeping a running tally of these incidents would be a useful service for some writer or blogger to provide; is there any exhaustive, or nearly complete list of black hoaxes?</p>
<p>As Madison Grant suggests, Ms. Blocker seems to have the makings of a Columbia professor, but even if that doesn&rsquo;t work out she&rsquo;s been paid for doing nothing for over a year. She&rsquo;s Keeping The Dream Alive.</p>

<p>My guess is that&rsquo;s how the government created the Black middle class.  And that&rsquo;s why the average middle class Black has such a poor credit rating, because they are not middle class but ghetto.  </p>
