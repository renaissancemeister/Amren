<h1>Boy Scouts Make Big Push to Get Latinos to Join</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antonio Olivo, Chicago Tribune, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Worried about dwindling membership, the organization has launched a pilot recruitment effort to double its ranks of Latinos to 200,000 before its centennial in February. Chicago is among six test sites for even more ambitious plans to tap into the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing demographic.</p>
<p>So far, however, the $1 million effort has faced language barriers, lax participation and other obstacles among the mostly immigrant parents viewed as crucial to the effort, illustrating broader concerns over that population&rsquo;s lack of integration into American society.</p>
<p>In a stark example of its efforts to overcome such hurdles, the strait-laced group has turned a blind eye to questions of illegal Immigration. The organization&rsquo;s leaders hope that will reassure some undocumented parents whose worries of detection contributed to several failed recruitment efforts since the 1980s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Through Spanish-language marketing and other efforts, the Scouts try to get around such hard realities. For example, parents without child care are urged to bring the whole family to meetings and camp outs, and low-income families are offered financial aid for uniforms and camping trips.</p>
<p>To avoid questions about Immigration status, Col√≥n and other recruiters emphasize that a Social Security number or other government ID isn&rsquo;t required when they carry out mandatory screening of volunteers that is designed to protect children from potential predators. Neither do they ask the Scouts about their Immigration papers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who has a child in the program or who wants to participate in the program may do so,&#8221; [Marcos Nava, a national Scout director] said. &#8220;When there is a lack of a Social Security number .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what we do ask is that [a local Scouts director] write a letter&#8221; vouching for that parent, he said.</p>
<p>Nava acknowledged that the approach has ruffled &#8220;one or two&#8221; feathers within the organization, but said Scout leaders view it as necessary to the group&rsquo;s survival.</p>

		<p>Yep, illegal aliens sure will be part of the drive to enlist Scouts. Whenever a newspaper in America writes that immigrants will be part of something, it invariably means illegal aliens. Why would a newspaper make a special mention that &#8220;immigrants&#8221; will be part of something? Legal immigrants have that right, so why mention it? In any case the article goes on to say that the Scouts want be asking for immigration papers,etc. Intelligent parents will get the hint, time to look for another way to keep Jr. occupied. He sure won&rsquo;t learn any values from the Boy Scouts.</p>

		<p>No SSN to check scout leaders?  Tick tock, waiting for the first sex abuse scandal.</p>
<p>I used to have sympathy for the Scouts, based on the culture war they were fighting against.  But they&rsquo;ve now surrendered to most of it.  I mean, what&rsquo;s the message you&rsquo;re sending when you say no to gay whites but yes to Mexican illegal aliens?</p>

<p>Well, here it is in black and white:  The one single reason that white groups, corporations, organizations, or what have you, have been watering down all things white is because they see their power or economical base dwindling.</p>
<p>The fact is any organization that does this deserves neither power nor money, and, I, for one, am glad to see them losing membership and strength.</p>
<p>These disgusting sychophants would sell their souls to the devil for power and money.  Culture, race, traditions anf values mean absolutely nothing to them.</p>
<p>Rome lasted about a thousand years.  After only a little more than two hundred this zoo is on the way out already, because of decadent do-gooderism by fools of the highest order. </p>

Another artificial attempt to make people into something they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>More time, money, and resources wasted on perhaps gaining a handful of hispanic youth.</p>
<p>If these people were inclined to be boy scouts, they would join. The fact that they don&rsquo;t just shows they aren&rsquo;t interested.</p>
<p>In a few years, maybe one hispanic will make Eagle Scout and he&rsquo;ll be paraded around as proof that anyone can be anything with enough resources.</p>

		<p>There is something very wierd going on here. Go to the Boy Scouts of America website. On its home page you will find&hellip;an attractive blue-eyed White woman and a black male standing on a mountain. These aren&rsquo;t kids. They look like they are in their early twenties. Who is the $$$$$ force behind Boy Scouts?</p>

It&rsquo;s sad to see scouting fall on hard times, when better </p>
<p>forms of revitalization could be enacted.  I&rsquo;m a scout leader </p>
<p>with my wolf cub son, and I see first hand the wrong </p>
<p>direction scouting is going.  Boy Scouting has always been an</p>
<p>unofficial training program for middle class families who </p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t afford military school.   This new outreach will </p>
<p>inevitably fail, and my hope is that the movement will focus on </p>
<p>quality over quantity.</p>

		<p>there are few latinos in the scouts because they are DIFFERENT from the organisations base and ethos. trying to recruit them is futile as they, as a rule, dont &#8220;do&#8221; scout things. obviously the organisation is desperate for members and are suffering a shrinking base from their traditional ranks as not only are those ranks diminishing in numbers themselves, but urbanisation, single parent families and such are causing their potential membership pool to dwindle.<br>
it is a waste of time and resources, and if successful, will dilute and ultimately ruin the organisation. but anyone that thinks that Christian churches, which are autonomous, are rich, has obviously never been involved with one.</p>

		<p>Boy Scouts will be turned into political arm of the Liberal ruling elite, just like Stalin&rsquo;s Red Pioneers were.</p>
<p>Next time they will try to recruit members among Muslim extremists so that American youths develop emotional ties with these highly undesirable individuals. That will help them to entrnch themselves in American society.<br>

To help other people at all times; <br>
To keep myself physically strong, <br>

<p>For an illegal alien, which country is &#8220;my country&#8221;?????</p>
<p>How can illegal aliens belong to a USA boys patriotic organization?<br>

		<p>Anyone actually surprised by this, that the Boy Scouts are merely interested in money?</p>
<p>Recently I read an article where people have been willing valuable land, for the purpose of being used by the Boy Scouts for retreats, etc.   &mdash;   and the Boy Scouts are making promises to the elderly in order to get them to will them the lands. Then, after the person has died, the Boy Scouts are selling off the land to developers. It&rsquo;s infuriating people who live near the camps as well as the relatives of the person who has died, who was deceived into thinking the land s/he was donating would be used for scouts.</p>

		<p>Does anyone else besides me get the distinct impression our children are subjected to intense BRAINWASHING from kindergarden through college? Shades of the Manchurian Candidate&hellip; the old communists could take lessons from the way Americans are subjected to intense brainwashing from infancy to the grave.</p>
<p>Kiddie cartoons showing White children and Black children. Movies, commercials implying your life is incomplete if you don&rsquo;t have Blacks or Black couples as your closest friends.</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Code stresses honesty and integrity. Yet the Boy Scouts are apparently so brainwashed they can&rsquo;t understand illegal immigration is a violation of our laws&hellip; thus itself a crime.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the propensity of Mexicans to do crimes. My wife&rsquo;s lady friend, born of a Venezuelan mother and American father&hellip; speaks fluent Spanish. She overhead a Mexican female in Wal-Mart, TEACHING HER BRATS HOW TO SHOPLIFT&hellip; without being caught. This is the kind of people our insane government policy saddles honest, decent-living Americans with.</p>

		<p>How, pray tell, do you run a background check absent ID?</p>
<p>As mestizos are the demographic by far the most prone to child rape (as well as DUI joyriding in stolen cars; &#8220;machismo&#8221; or whatever they call it) this cannot work out well.</p>
<p>Methinks the meaning of the sign engraved on Baden-Powells headstone (a circle with a dot in it - &#8220;I have done my duty and gone home&#8221;) should now be changed to &#8220;spinning in his grave&#8221;. The 100th anniversary is fitting.</p>

		<p>First, I read an article about the Girl Scouts championing Feminism,and Lesbianism</p>
<p>A woman who had been a member of the Girl Scouts, for over 10 years, and then a Troop Leader, who finally reached the National level of the Organization, had come to terms with what has been going on with the Girl Scouts, and decided to leave the Organization that she, her sisters, and her mother had all belonged to. She had gone on to found the &#8220;Heritage Girls&#8221; which now has approximately 8,000 girls as members. </p>
<p>Now, as far as the Boy Scouts are concerned, I think that it is safe to say that this is not your father&rsquo;s Boy Scouts, of Honesty, Loyalty, Thrift, Cleanliness, Cheerfulness, etc. </p>
<p>No, this will be another watered-down version of the YMCA Day Camp nonsense, with all the Inner-City type kids in it, which should bring the Boy Scouts to its demise quite quickly.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all about money. The head of the Boy Scouts is the highest paid nonprofit executive in the America.</p>
<p>The can be no economic argument against the race replacement of the majority Native Born White American population.</p>
<p>As a mentioned above, the Christian Churches have massive involvement wih the Boy Scouts. WE know that they are on board with the program to race-replacement Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>I was born and raised an Irish Catholic. These days, I have absolutely no conection to the Catholic Church. I consider the Catholic Church my mortal enemy. I feel the same way about the Protestant Churches. I am not the least bit happy about this. But what chioce do I have.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts are also pushing miscegenation-a great evil. Go to their website and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. I mean it is really upfront and in your face.</p>

		<p>The leadership of Scouting needs to be overhauled. The push for immigrants is only going to create more problems for the &#8220;volunteers&#8221; who spend so much time in the trenches making Scouts work. The immigrant families for the most part do not want to assimilate into our culture. Ask any Scout Leader who has had large numbers of this population how it went and they will tell you they never show up and then they disappear. <br>
I don&rsquo;t see how they can keep the SSN, etc out unless the parents are kept out of the meetings. Otherwise, they have to fill out adult leader applications and be subjected to a background check. In fact, every first grade Cub Scout (Tiger) must have a registered parent leader with them at every meeting. </p>

		<p>I did not mean to imply in my first post that latinos in the Boy Scouts will lead to the downfall of the Boy Scouts. Even when I was a pre-teen, the Boy Scouts has some Mexican/Latino boys as scouts. This was in the California of an earlier time. The point is, these latinos/Mexicans were totally assimilated to the nation. We hardly even thought of some of these guys as being latino or Mexican. They talked English without any accent whatever,were interested in the same stuff other kids were, and never brought up Mexico or some other place,etc. Today it is totally different. You have a generation that is brainwashed by the leftist public school system, to identify with their own culture and history. Then there is the outright violation of existing immigration law the Boy Scout Organization is willing to allow. They should have a class action suit brought against them, or better yet, citizens who have kids in the scouts should remove them. The bottom line of Money, is not reason enough to allow every type of organization in the U.S. to decide to ignore U.S. laws. That&rsquo;s called anarchy.</p>

<p>Survival will turn into a long, slow, protracted death of what we currently know of Scout doctrines and policies. Hispanics will reshape scouting into their own image and that pretty much sums it up.</p>

		<p>Not every Christian subscribes to the Egalitarian Marxist view of the world. Even Christ did not treat everyone equally. </p>
<p>I have written about a Catholic Priest in Italy that wears a Swastika armband on his Cassack. His name is Father Angelo Idi, and was the subject of an interview with the Austrian Times, on April 27, 2009.</p>
<p>Father Angelo has definate opinions about Race and Culture, particularly his Italian Culture, which he would like to preserve from the onslaught of Third World Immigration.</p>
<p>I will remind you that during the 1930s, Father Caughlin, an Irish Catholic Priest, had one of the highest rated, and most listened to Radio Shows of the Decade. </p>
<p>Father Caughlin was an ardent White Supremacist, when the word was not used much, since it was understood that Whites were the Supreme Culture on the Planet.</p>

		<p>Several years ago it came to my attention that the local Boy Scout leader was openly supporting the local illegal alien population.  I called him and asked him if he saw no conflict between things in the Scout code such as &#8220;honor&#8221; and &#8220;duty to country&#8221; and his supporting outlaws and invaders.  He bluntly replied that he did not see any conflict.  People like that usually have illegal alien lovers or employees.  It&rsquo;s the only logical conclusion.</p>
