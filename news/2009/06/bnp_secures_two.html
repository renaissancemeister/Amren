<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin has been elected to the European Parliament as the party won its first two seats.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin was elected for the North West region while Andrew Brons picked up another BNP seat in Yorkshire and Humber, where it won 10% of the vote.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said the BNP was not racist, but won votes because it &#8220;spoke openly about the problem of immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s Harriet Harman described the result as &#8220;terrible&#8221; while Tory leader David Cameron said he was &#8220;sickened&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Great victory&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Griffin was elected to Brussels even though the BNP polled fewer votes in the region than it had in 2004  &mdash;  the slump in Labour support meant its share of the vote increased.</p>
<p>It meant that although the BNP came fifth in the popular vote in the region, it won a seat through the system of proportional representation used in the European elections.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin denied the party was racist, telling the BBC&rsquo;s Radio 4 Today programme: &#8220;There&rsquo;s a huge amount of racism in this country, overwhelmingly it is directed towards the indigenous British majority, which is one reason we&rsquo;ve done so well in these elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the &#8220;ruling elite&#8221; had made the &#8220;indigenous majority .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. second-class citizens in every possible sphere&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Labour Party, the Lib Dems and the Tories, by leaving the door to Britain open, has forced people to turn to a party which speaks openly about the problem of immigration and says that while there might be a few good things about it there&rsquo;s also a lot of bad things.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;People&rsquo;s fears&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Ms Harman said: &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a terrible thing that we&rsquo;ve now got representing Britain in the European Parliament a party that is a racist party, a party that doesn&rsquo;t believe black people should even be allowed to join this party.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;The British National Party have played on people&rsquo;s fears .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we&rsquo;ll have to work to tackle the fear that lead to people to vote BNP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Communities Secretary John Denham said that although &#8220;an element&#8221; of those who voted for the BNP would have been racists, most would have cast their ballots for the party because they felt ignored and excluded.</p>
<p>He told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s The World At One: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to make it very clear that we want to hear what those voters are saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conservative leader David Cameron told party supporters: &#8220;It sickens me as it should sicken everybody here that the British National Party has succeeded in these European elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It brings shame on us that these fascist, racist thugs have been elected to the European Parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said politicians had to be &#8220;uncompromising&#8221; about the BNP which he said was &#8220;a party of thugs, of fascists&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Media &#8216;onslaught&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But he added: &#8220;We should not dismiss the reasons why people have voted for the BNP  &mdash;  the anger, the frustration, the sense of alienation, the sense of powerlessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must listen to that and must react to that, that much is obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP won more than 120,139 votes in the Yorkshire region, slightly less than in 2004, but enough to take one of the six seats on offer in the region.</p>
<p>Successful candidate Andrew Brons acknowledged that his victory would not be &#8220;universally popular&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the party, which denies stirring racial hatred, had survived an &#8220;onslaught&#8221; by the media and the political classes during the campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the headlines, money and misrepresentation, we have managed to win through,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The election was the &#8220;first step&#8221; towards the UK removing itself from the &#8220;EU dictatorship&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Dagenham Labour MP Jon Cruddas said the BNP &#8220;have not really moved on&#8221; in terms of its share of the vote since 2004 but the party had benefited from the drop in Labour support.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;There&rsquo;s a long-term legacy here of us failing to bring people with us and deal with some of the issues that concern them, be they around housing, or about employment insecurity or the recession or immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP targeted the North West during the campaign, having had earlier success in local council elections.</p>
<p>It won one of its three English county council seats in Burnley in Thursday&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>As Mr Griffin arrived at the North West count  &mdash;  held in Manchester&rsquo;s town hall  &mdash;  on Sunday, his car was surrounded by noisy protesters, who broke one of its windows.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin returned later and entered the building by the back entrance, accompanied by several minders. Police said one man was arrested in scuffles when Mr Griffin tried to get into the building.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.episcopal-life.org/81808_109343_ENG_HTM.htm">Britain: Churches &lsquo;Appalled&rsquo; at European Union Election Gains for Extremist Party</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Martin Revis, Episcopal Life, June 8, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Christian leaders in Britain have deplored gains made by the extreme right-wing British National Party in elections to the European Union parliament.</p>
<p>The party, which campaigned for the &#8220;voluntary&#8221; repatriation of non-white immigrants, won two seats for the first time in the European Parliament. The party also won three local council seats in elections held in England at the same time as the EU poll.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is deeply disappointing that we now have a racist party representing Britain in Europe for the next five years and it is vital that our remaining U.K. representatives dedicate themselves to promote the common good,&#8221; said the Rev. Graham Sparkes, spokesperson for the Baptist Union of Great Britain in a statement on June 8.</p>
<p>Commenting on behalf of the United Reformed Church the day after the release of the EU election results, Frank Kantor said: &#8220;We must never become comfortable with the BNP using their position to promote their racist policies. We will continue to counter their message of hatred and fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commentators have attributed BNP gains to a low voter turnout for the European elections of just more than 30 percent in Britain. This was attributed to recent political scandals, particularly excessive expenses claims by both government and opposition lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The limited success of the BNP does not change the steadfast message: God loves all. Racism is a sin,&#8221; said Rachel Lampard, public issues adviser for the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>Anglican Bishop Nicholas Reade of Blackburn in northwest England, said the election of BNP leader Nick Griffin marked a &#8220;bitter&#8221; day for the region. &#8220;All people of good faith will be appalled at the election of an extremist candidate to supposedly represent the northwest of England in Europe,&#8221; said Reade.</p>

		<p>It is racist to defend your own people?  Only if those people are white, every other group is allowed to advocate for itself.  I just hope the BNP can keep its cool and respond in to these unfair characterizations in calm, measured, intellegent manner.</p>

		<p>The question now becomes, &#8220;with their first ever victory in the E.U., what is the BNP&rsquo;s next move???&#8221; It&rsquo;s one thing to win an election, but turning that victory into real-world gains is a whole other monster. As this article points out, the BNP did not actually gain any votes this time around, but in fact, they lost votes. The fact that Labour lost more is the only reason the BNP picked up any seats, which is kind of disappointing when you think about it. I would not have expected the BNP&rsquo;s support to have dropped. But, we have to take a win however we can get it. It&rsquo;s put-up or shut-up time for the BNP now. It&rsquo;s easy to scream about the evils of the system when you&rsquo;re not a part of it, but when you actually have a voice in the government, you become responsible for every thing it does. The BNP might be able to rely on voter-apathy to get their foot in the door, but small voter turn out, alone, will never be enough to give them the degree of governmental control needed to reverse decades of treasonous policy. The majority of voters voted against the establishment by not voting at all. That is not the same thing as support for the BNP. The BNP has to use it&rsquo;s new position of power to show these disenfranchised voters that they can and will deliver on their promises. I really hope they&rsquo;re prepared to rise to this challenge.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;Labour&rsquo;s Harriet Harman described the result as &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; while Tory leader David Cameron said he was &ldquo;sickened&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;&ldquo;All people of good faith will be appalled at the election of an extremist candidate to supposedly represent the northwest of England in Europe,&rdquo; said Reade.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic the BNP won and other right orgs in Europe, but let me point out a thing or two.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example above of what I meant when I mentioned several times that the right is so inflexible and uptight it doesn&rsquo;t know how to use psychological warfare, and the left destroys them with it.  It must learn immediately and drop this &#8220;gentlemanly&#8221; position or it will never score enough followers.</p>
<p>Just look at what the geeks above have to say about a party that believes in a homeland for themselves and their people and they can point to tons of stats, revealing that the importation of crime, poverty, bombings and other pathologies to their country, is the direct result of immigration, but it is the messengers who are demonized, and the people who are tearing their nation down have the gall to viciously denigrate the BNP for doing what every non-white nation on earth does, which is to protect themselves, their country and their own people.</p>
<p>The Right in Britain and all throughout the West should be fighting tooth and nail with psychological warfare the same exact way that the mentally ill leftists do.</p>
<p>Statements should be issued by BNP members denouncing the leftists and their positions and viciously criticizing them for calling people racists who are patriotic citizens who respect and love their country, their ancestors, and their culture, and they do not want to continue to support, poverty, crime, bombings and anti-white hatred from people who believe their adopted country should be changed to suit them.</p>
<p>The Right should constantly harp on the fact that BNP members are being prosecuted by mentally ill factions who want to silence anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe in an open borders agenda, because, they themselves have been brainwashed into accepting the agenda and hating themselves in the process.</p>
<p>And when they get tired of issuing these attacks, they should redouble their efforts with new wording, along with examples of which there are an abundance revealing home grown terrorists, black violence mongers who are too dumb to qualify for anything but menial labor so they turn to crime and live on the public dole while they fill the prisons.</p>
<p>The attacks should pick up on wording from the likes of the statements above, but turned around and directed at the leftist fringe relentlessly.  In fact the right should condemn the left for causing ethnic intimidation and violence by virtue of their insane immigration policies and their national laws that do not hold jihadist-inciting imans liable for preaching death and destruction against the country that so graciously (But stupidly) took them in.</p>
<p>I can think of thousands of attacks that could squeak by their perverted laws designed to silence, and most of them could twist leftist statements around to make them the objects of scathing attacks, using the same wording they use against the right.</p>
<p>In war, no quarter is given and none should be expected.  The goal is to either win or die.</p>

<p>Oh what a pity!</p>
<p>Now I wonder Comrade Harman, why &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Comrade BO who was visiting Europe this week from the USA, didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;magically&rdquo; halt the forward march of your continent&rsquo;s nationalists? </p>
<p>Could it be divine intervention of a different sort, the non-multicultural sort?</p>

<p>And these fools wonder why church attendance has been dropping for decades in the West?</p>
<p>I am of the mind Comrade Lampard, that if &ldquo;God loves all&rdquo; and considers &ldquo;racism&rdquo; a &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; he loves even the people you would call &ldquo;racists&rdquo; and cannot look favorably on multiculturalism (your true religion) which is genocidal and anti-white racism incarnate. There is no compromise that can be made with multiculturalism or its demon progenitor, Marxism; evil is evil, no matter how good it makes you feel Comrade Lampard.</p>

<p>So the establishment pols are upset at the vote(rs) as they use words like &#8220;terrible&#8221;, &#8220;sickening&#8221; to describe the vote results or in other words: the will of the people. The BNP won because the other parties failed to respond to the will of the people.</p>
<p>Why is it the when the lefties don&rsquo;t get what the want or when things don&rsquo;t go the way they want they call other people names,attack, etc directly and / or indirectly as in the above.quote?</p>

<p> &#8220;Racism is a sin.&rdquo; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>So much ugliness!  Lies.  Misrepresentation.  Name calling.  <br>
And that&rsquo;s just the tip of it.</p>
<p>Politics are raw and vicious in Europe   &mdash;   much nastier than anything Americans know. It can get ugly.  In Europe, it&rsquo;s often been violent and bloody, characterized by a passion and intensity that Americans can&rsquo;t imagine. <br>
 <br>
Americans engage in some flag-waving, speeches, parades, cheers and hoopla&hellip; then go vote and then it&rsquo;s all over; they go back to their ordinary lives and get along with each other.  They don&rsquo;t bitterly hate their neighbors who voted the &#8220;wrong&#8221; way;  and families don&rsquo;t feud with other families for generations or centuries afterward. They don&rsquo;t seek each other&rsquo;s ruin. Europeans have done so.</p>
<p>Americans don&rsquo;t battle in the streets, assasinate candidates, knee-cap opponents, shoot dissenters, send each other to the guillotine or gulags, construct barbed wire camps for the opposition.  They don&rsquo;t pass laws to forbid their opponents from so much as writing or speaking their forbidden views, under pain of dispossession and  imprisonment.  Europeans do!</p>
<p>American political campaigns are a big show, a carvaval, a kind of national entertainment spectacular.  In America, politics are a game.  In  Europe, politics are  deadly.   After centuries of bloodshed and vicious wars, Europeans don&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>All this may come to America in time. But for now it&rsquo;s a European trademark. The ugly side of Europe.  Contrary to the entertainment spectacles staged in America,  politics in Europe are not pretty. The defeated don&rsquo;t willingly accept defeat.  The voting booth is viewed as only one way of getting the power they seek.  This could get nasty.</p>

		<p>Christianity was once the exclusive value and belief system of white Europe and Western civilization.  The Christian cross is still carried on the flags of Britain, England, Greece, Quebec, Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Finland.   </p>
<p>Now that the Christian churches have gone global, many are actively engaged in promoting cross-border solidarity with primitive Third World non-whites.  </p>
<p>Like the international socialists, their agenda is to prosletyze for multiculturalism and the brotherhood of man, in revolutionary opposition to their First World (white) economic class enemies.  </p>

		<p>The B.N.P. is the only group, political or religous, that will stand up for the indigenous white population. I am continually appalled, when I read articles such as the above, at the extent of treasonous behavior that is displayed by every so called mainstream british establishment. The very people into whose hands the care of the U.K. has been given in to are the very people who are trying their best to destroy every vestige of white culture and the white population along with it. Never in the history of the world has treason at such a level been known.</p>

		<p>Of course, it would have been nice if the 13 seats UKIP picked up had gone to the BNP. UKIP is just part of the controlled opposition that the elites keep around to drain off votes that could have been spent productively on the BNP. It must be kept in mind, though, that perception counts for a great deal in politics and this vote represents a huge groundswell of support for getting out of the EU.</p>
<p>The BNP have a lot of work cut out for them. Educating the electorate will be a really big part of that. Everyone who wants to keep Britain British needs to help the party, financially and otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must listen to that and must react to that, that much is obvious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does that mean the Lib Dems should start being like the BNP? If so, won&rsquo;t that turn them into &#8220;thugs&#8221; and &#8220;fascists&#8221;?</p>
<p>More empty rhetoric, which is why droves of ordinary Brits are turning to the BNP nowadays.</p>

		<p>The British Church and Conservative leader represent a body of opinion motivated by craven fear of upsetting non anglos and the even greater fear of appearing less than broad minded. It is clear by now that something truly awful must happen nationally, something worse than a twin tower attack in the UK,  for the traditional political parties  to see the error of their ways. One is reminded of how loathsomely fast the British public jumped in bed with the spineless Atlee scarcely months after the end of the last war in Europe. To even life long anglophiles like myself it is hard today to imagine Great Britain ever having been  capable of defending its vital interests.  </p>

		<p>HH on #15 hopes that the same results can be achieved here, in the U.S.. </p>
<p>Well,yes it can happen here, with an informed Electorate, instead of one that is led around by the nose, by the Media, and Music, and Movie &#8220;Stars&#8221; like Bruce Springsteen, and Bon Jovi, Ron Howard, and Tom Hanks. </p>
<p>I suggest to all readers of this web site, that they take an active role in your child&rsquo;s School, and get involved in the PTA, or run for School Board, since our children are being force-fed the Liberal Multiculturalism at Kindergarten level, along with that of perverted Homosexuality, Lesbianism, and Transgenderism. </p>
<p>This has already been included as part of the School curriculums in Massachussets. To read more about this, and the effort to reverse this terrible indoctrination, visit <a href="https://www.massresistance.org./" rel="nofollow">https://www.massresistance.org.</a></p>
<p>Also, we as patriotic Americans, with Conservative values, must look to make a Third Party viable in State and National <br>
elections. </p>
<p>I suggest that we consider the America First Party, or the Constitution Party, with their beliefs in Limited Government, anti-Abortion Platforms, a firm stand against Illegal Immigration, a commitment to preserving Our Right to Keep and  Bear Arms, and restoring the Constitution, and Bill of Rights to their rightful place, as our guiding principles, of our Republic. </p>

		<p>Here is going to be the problem for the BNP going forward:</p>
<p>They did great in these elections because the system is condusive to non-lamestream parties.  This encouraged BNP voters and sympathists to come out and vote.  When Gordon Clown finally gets over the denial stage, accepts his fate, and calls elections. the BNP probably won&rsquo;t do as well, because each district (constituency) is winner take all, even if it is not a majority.</p>
<p>With Cameron and Gordon Clown spewing hate and vitriol towards BNP successes, how will this affect the average BNP voter who might have voted either Con or Lab in the upcoming elections, so as not to &#8220;throw away their vote?&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP&rsquo;s best chance is to pour their newfound money into several constituencies where they&rsquo;re the strongest AND Labor has had a stronghold.  We now know that BNP draws most of its blood away from Labor, and that Cameron is the next PM.  BNP best chance to win MP seats is to chip away in districts where both they and Labor are strong.</p>

		<p>Why is it that being called a racist is considered so bad or insulting?</p>
<p>If standing up for one&rsquo;s own race, culture and achievements is being racist then so be it. We, the Whites, have built the greatest civilisation that has ever existed. Our intelligence, the ability to think laterally coupled with our energy, drive and inititave has created this civilisation which is coveted by every third world country and it&rsquo;s peoples.</p>
<p>If defending and standing up for our culture is racist then I am proud to wear that badge. It is time that people were not intimidated by the term racist. It is time that politicians were made to realised that being called a racist is no longer an insult but rather a reflection on themselves.</p>

		<p>As i said in my other post anything the BNP achieves has to be looked in the light of the fact that they are demonised by the whole political Establishment. National Union of Journalists (NUJ) rules state that if the BNP have to be mentioned at all then they must be portrayed in an unfavourable light, &amp; on top of all that they are allowed no right of reply. </p>
<p>UKIP is a safety-valve Establishment front party that was involved in various Euro MPs expenses scandals of its own but, close to rock-bottom &amp; polling 3% in opinion polls to the BNP&rsquo;s actual 20-30% in council elections, they were resurrected by the MSM to fill the huge gap created by the collapse of New Labour due to the Westminster MPs expenses fraud. It was UKIP this &amp; UKIP that, ignoring, as always, the BNP completely. No wonder uninformed voters chose the UKIP front party to inadvertently prop up the dying Lib/Lab/Con corrupt politicians hoping to live to fight another day and preserve their corrupt system.</p>
<p>Already several attempted attacks on Nick Griffin have taken place by the supposed anti-fascist Unite Against Fascism/Searchlight groups who are sponsored by taxpayers&rsquo; money, and have many Lib/Lab/Con politicians as signed-up members in their &#8221;fight against fascism&#8221;. In such a way do the corrupt pro-EU Lib/Lab/Con political Establishment use the brainwashed neo-Marxist students their corrupt system produces to cling on to power &amp; further their attempts at making the Islamified/multicultural Federal European superstate irreversible, using the tool of mass immigration. This, despite the fact that their &#8221;extremist&#8221; propaganda &amp; lies convinces less &amp; less people each day. The nationalist BNP are demonised as &#8221;extremist&#8221; for holding views that would have been universal fity years ago and are still held by a large minority today. For, despite all the globalist neo-Marxist brainwashing, when the BNP truth is known, then their neo-Marxist NWO/globalist EUSSR II, built on a Web of Lies, will collapse like its predecessor. That is why the BNP MUST be silenced.</p>
<p>Great news for Americans is that you are already forming your own nationalist parties that will break the Reps v Dems Tweedledee/Tweedledum scam that the political elite use to stay in power. The first hole in the dam is already being formed. As the USA has a bit more history of supporting personal freedoms than the present neo-Marxist UK it will be easier to break the mould and I am sure if Americans move quickly, support these parties and work hard, then the two-party system scam which enslaves ordinary people will rapidly collapse.<br>

<p>Little wonder the BNP is coming on like gangbusters. In fact, all BNP leaders have to do now is consistently and strongly address these universal concerns to soon become a majority party.  </p>
