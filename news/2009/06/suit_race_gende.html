<p>An association of contractors accused Caltrans in a lawsuit Thursday of colluding with the Obama administration to flout California&rsquo;s ban on race and sex preferences by reserving some state road-building contracts for companies owned by minorities and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caltrans is sideswiping the important principle of equal opportunity by using race, not lowest cost by a responsible bidder, to decide who gets government road and highway contracts,&#8221; said Sharon Browne, a Pacific Legal Foundation attorney who filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Sacramento.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, the Associated General Contractors&rsquo; San Diego chapter, seek to overturn the state Department of Transportation&rsquo;s decision in March to set aside 6.75 percent of federally funded road contracts to minority- and female-owned firms or to require contractors to make good-faith efforts to reach that goal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Schwarzenegger administration adopted the current program in March with the approval of the Obama administration, based on a Caltrans study that found minority- and female-owned companies were persistently underrepresented in state transportation funding-receiving only 2.2 percent of federal contracting dollars, compared with a stated goal of 13.5 percent.</p>
<p>A Federal Highway Administration official told Caltrans in a Feb. 25 letter that failing to take immediate steps to reach that goal could bring penalties that &#8220;may include withholding federal funds,&#8221; particularly the congressionally approved stimulus funds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Browne said the department had unsuccessfully sought federal approval for race-conscious contracting for two years and finally got it after Obama took office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caltrans declined comment on the suit. The NAACP&rsquo;s state president, Alice Huffman, said the contractor plaintiffs were trying to move the state backward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caltrans needs more equal opportunity in contracting with businesses owned by people of color-not less,&#8221; she said.</p>
