			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Richardson, Oz Conservative, June 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s an American comedian called Louis CK who has picked up the gist of whiteness theory.</p>
<p>According to the theory, race is an artificial category invented by whites to uphold their unearned privilege over the non-white other.</p>
<p>Below is a {snip} transcript [of a YouTube clip]:</p>
<blockquote>Sorry I&rsquo;m being so negative. I&rsquo;m a bummer, I don&rsquo;t know I shouldn&rsquo;t be I&rsquo;m a very lucky guy. I got a lot going from me. I&rsquo;m a healthy, I&rsquo;m relatively young. I&rsquo;m white; which thank God for that sh** boy. That is a huge leg up, are you kidding me? I love being white I really do. Seriously, if you&rsquo;re not white you&rsquo;re missing out because this sh** is pearly good. Let me be clear by the way, I&rsquo;m not saying that white people are better. I&rsquo;m saying that being white is clearly better, who could even argue? If it was an option I would reup ever year. Oh yeah I&rsquo;ll take white again absolutely, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying that, I&rsquo;ll stick with white thank you. Here&rsquo;s how great it is to be white, I could get in a time machine and go to any time and it would be f***** awesome when I get there. That is exclusively a white privilege. Black people can&rsquo;t f*** with time machines. A black guy in a time machine is like hey anything before 1980 no thank you, I don&rsquo;t want to go. But I can go to any time. The year 2, I don&rsquo;t even know what was happening then but I know when I get there, welcome we have a table right here for you sir &hellip; thank you, it&rsquo;s lovely here in the year 2. I can go to any time in the past, I don&rsquo;t want to go to the future and find out what happens to white people because we&rsquo;re going to pay hard for this sh**, you gotta know that &hellip; we&rsquo;re not just gonna fall from number 1 to 2. They&rsquo;re going to hold us down and f*** us in the ass forever and we totally deserve it but for now wheeeee. If you&rsquo;re white and you don&rsquo;t admit that it&rsquo;s great, you&rsquo;re an a******. It is great and I&rsquo;m a man. How many advantages can one person have? I&rsquo;m a white man, you can&rsquo;t even hurt my feelings. What can you really call a white man that really digs deep? Hey cracker &hellip; oh ruined my day. Boy shouldn&rsquo;t have called me a cracker, bringing me back to owning land and people what a drag.
</blockquote>
<p>The basic message of the Louis CK rant? Whites have always been privileged at the expense of everyone else and will be justifiably harshly punished for it.</p>
<p>So confident is Louis CK of the theory that he even extends it through known time. Go back in a time machine, even to the year 2 A.D., and there will be whites lapping up their privilege by denying a decent life to others.</p>
<p>The theory explains quite a bit about the liberal attitude to white forms of identity. If you accept the theory, then it makes sense to treat whites differently and to see any expression of white identity as an assertion of supremacy. After all, if it&rsquo;s true that whiteness was created to oppress others, then anyone defending it must be in favour of white supremacy.</p>
<p>The theory, though, is rubbish. First, it&rsquo;s clearly nonsensical to claim that what European villagers were doing in the year 2 A.D. had any significant effect on the lives of African or Asian villagers of the same era.</p>
<p>Second, it simply isn&rsquo;t true that Europeans have always had the upper hand when it comes to conquest and colonialism. For much of history Europe itself was conquered by foreign powers and subject to colonial rule.</p>
<p>Think of Russia under the Tatar yoke for several centuries. Or Spain under the Moors. Or the Balkans under the Ottomans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even true that whites are the most privileged racial group in America today. That distinction clearly goes to Asians:</p>
<blockquote>In the year 2000, 4.1% of America&rsquo;s population was Asian American, but Asian Americans were 13.6% of doctors and dentists, 13.2% of computer specialists, 9.9% of engineers, 6.1% of accountants, 8.7% of post-secondary teachers (such as uni professors) and 6.9% of architects.
<p>Asian Americans have the highest percentage of two-parent families (73%) and the highest mean family income ($77,000). White Americans were somewhat lower on both counts (67% and $70,000).</p>
<p>Asian Americans, though only 4 percent of the nation&rsquo;s population, account for nearly 20 percent of all medical students. Forty-five percent of Berkeley&rsquo;s freshman class, but only 12 percent of California&rsquo;s populace, consists of Asian-Americans. And at UT-Austin, 18 percent of the freshman class is Asian American, compared to 3 percent for the state.</blockquote></p>
<p>So what are white Americans being punished for? They have been singled out for the sake of a political theory.</p>
<p>Liberals want to make unchosen qualities like our sex and our race not matter. But this means they have to explain why these qualities mattered in the past.</p>
<p>Some right-liberals are content to simply explain their existence in terms of the backwardness of history which progress will finally overcome. But left-liberals generally go further than this.</p>
<p>Left-liberals assert, first, that categories like our sex and race are not natural entities but artificial social constructs. Why were they constructed? As an act of power. They allowed one privileged class of people to assert a dominance of will over another oppressed class of people.</p>
<p>So there has to be a dominant oppressor group with an artificial, supremacist identity for the theory to work. Whites got tapped on the shoulder for the role.</p>
<p>As a result, we get to be the ones who deserve what&rsquo;s coming to us.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s all theory. It all depends on a number of doubtful claims, such as that our sex and our race are social constructs, and that male identities and white identities have an essentially negative purpose and origin in oppressing others.</p>

<p>Think of European White ruled by the Nobels and Clergy - no lack of exploitation there.  Think of the peasant serfs who had to - by force - support their leige lords.  Think of the serfs who were only liberated in 1862 by the Tsar (and then had to buy the land they lived on and were made even poorer).  Think of the White slave trade that has gone on for centuries and continues today (with no outcry from the media).  Think of the White &#8220;slaves&#8221; of the Industrial Revolution in Europe and New England, who lived worse than Blacks in the Antebellum South.</p>
<p>This commedian is doing what many people do - including many Amren posters; He selects popular notions of history in the abreviated form that fits the notion he wishes to promote and whips the horse to death.  Fact and reality is much more complex than that.</p>

		<p>This is an attempt to bypass debating popst-1965 immigration policy in terms of Native Born White American interests,because if the issue is debated this way the immigration enthusiasts fall flat on their face.</p>
<p>This is another attempt to justify the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans and to hopefully convince Native Born White Americans to commit racial suicde within the borders of America.</p>
<p>When confronted in a debate with the &#8220;White privelege&#8221; nonsense, depose of it quickly and devastatingly Then refocus the &#8220;debate&#8221; on why Native Born White Americans should tolerate an immigration policy that will reduce them to a ever dwindling racial minority within the border of America; 2)economically marginalize Native Born White Americans and 3)cause exponential non-white population growth that over time will cause the US population to shoot well over a billion and the process destroy the environment and the amenities such as beautifull forests and crystal clear streams. This is what the debate is about&hellip;nothing else. </p>

		<p>About nine years ago, I tested out the white privilege theory.  I went to a BMW dealership in St. Louis, and asked the dealer to give me the most expensive 7-series sedan, ca. $140,000, because I had white skin privilege.  He laughed, and probably saw right through my rouse, but the manager was not so impressed.  I left the premises before he could call the cops.</p>
<p>So much for white skin privilege.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t take comics seriously, since there&rsquo;s only so much they can say on stage.  They may like to think they&rsquo;re pushing the envelope, but you can bet they all have Michael Richards&rsquo; career-ending fiasco burned into their brains.   They all know where the third rail is &amp; they know not to touch it, or they won&rsquo;t last long. </p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s different off-stage.  If you could talk to this guy privately, maybe when he&rsquo;s had a few drinks in him &amp; is being in completely honest &hellip; my guess is it would sound VERY different.   <br/>

Do they think when they get their dream of a white minority, brown-black-and everything in-between majority run America, that somehow they will be spared because they&rsquo;re &#8220;one of the good ones&#8221;?</p>

<p>So rants and raves, the clearly dementedly self-hating &ldquo;comedian&rdquo; Comrade Louis CK!</p>
<p>But I wonder if that is really why he is so afraid of the future, and his concern for whites who will live there? Perhaps, it is not that nonwhites will be in any position to give whitey in general the shaft, in any orifice of their liking; however, whites of certain: political, socioeconomic, or even comedic persuasions will be cast into their midst for such treatment? </p>
<p>Maybe, one fine day in the not so distant future (certainly not requiring a time machine) such whites as Comrade Louis CK, will find themselves cast from our &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; midst as untouchables fit only to live with nonwhites?</p>
<p>Now that deserves a: Wheeeee……………………….</p>

		<p>We get discriminated against in just about every way possible. Whites are low man on the totem pole for any government job out there, social program or university entrance. If I have a perfect SAT, awesome grades and participated in just about every club or sport available I still have to see just about every mediocre Black or Hispanic get the slot ahead of me. </p>

<p>Although this silly rant was thoroughly demolished by Mr. Richardson, I would add that how you would be treated when you stepped off that time machine depends on where in the world you landed. If you landed in the Americas, you might well be scalped by Native Americans. If you landed in Africa, you might be boiled alive by cannibals. Naturally, if you looked like the natives you might have a better chance of being accepted, but that&rsquo;s true of any race.</p>

		<p>I attended a majority black school in a majority black city. It was most definitely NOT a privilege to be white. </p>
<p>The thing with self hating, self righteous trolls like Louis CK is that he thinks that because HE is a spoiled brat that EVERYONE is a spoiled brat. And having had so much &#8220;privilege&#8221; in his own life he feels justified tearing down others whether they have been &#8220;priviliged&#8221; or not. I can only say that noone wishes for him to lose his &#8220;privilege&#8221; more than I.</p>

		<p>Within Ameridian society-Inca,Maya,Aztec and &#8220;Native&#8221; American-there conqests,genocides and gruesome religious practices. And don&rsquo;t forget the brutal tribal warfare in African where the losers in tribal warfare were enslaved.</p>
<p>There is only one issue:Why should Native Born White Americans support the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy that over time reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. ASk every anti-white imigration enthusiast this question.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest:there is no debate. WE oppose race-replacement. They can take it or leave it. This is how you respond to the white priveledge nonesense. Tell any self-hating White person who blathers on about White Priveledge to go go live in Chad,Sudan or Nigeria. From what I understand these nations have very large  african  majorities. I am very ceratin that the White priveledge theorists will be very happy in these nations.</p>
<p>The White priveledge theorists are the racists&hellip;.in addition to being a bunch of losers. </p>

		<p>The reasoning behind the notion of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; is flawed.  This alleged privilege does not just come out of the air only to be hoarded by greedy undeserving whites.  Our people have worked hard to produce prosperity.  </p>
<p>What we have worked so hard for, our civilization and society is now being brutally stolen from us by people who can not produce for them selves.  Where is John Galt?<br/>

		<p>It was amusing to hear Secretary of State Clinton celebrate the victory of Rachel Alexandra over a field of colts in the Preakness Stakes.  She neglected to mention, however, that fillies are allowed to carry five pounds fewer around the track, that jockeys and trainers, hardboiled realists, see affirmative action for what it truly is, handicapping.  Here in Alabama, fervor for collegiate football no longer enhances but degrades our lives.  What would it be like if a mere fraction of this gladitorial zeal were directed toward cleaning a river or teaching a child to read?  As a mental gambit, I now fret only over a singular and noble sporting event, the Kentucky Derby.  If I could love my daughter, my gods, my &#8220;ex&#8221; as Alysheba stumbled and won, I would be the second-best human who ever lived.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White Priveledge&#8221; is indeed a reality, though not necessarily in the way that ethnics describe. It is indeed a priveledge to be white and recieve the natural endowments that come from same. The &#8220;comedian&#8221; is right that the future is looking difficult for whitey, but the plan to bring down the white man by promoting &#8220;minority priveledge&#8221; is going to backfire. The added obstacles in the way of the white race will cause the whites to become stronger and even more preserverant. Unlike ethnics, the white race will overcome the obstacles. At the same time this is happening, the unearned promotion of minorities will make them even more complacent, thus widening the gap between the races. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a clip of this guy on You Tube.  He is monumentally unfunny.  He confuses the use of profanity with the telling of jokes - they are not the same thing.  He is just another self-hating white liberal, who thinks that being down with the oppressed brown people will give him some special dispensation with the brothers (it won&rsquo;t).  And what&rsquo;s up with his stage name?  &#8220;Louis CK&#8221; - as if he was some kind of rapper.  He should be parachuted into the middle of Oakland or Baltimore - that&rsquo;ll show him how righteous his adopted people are.</p>

		<p>I am tired of hearing about how white people have been busy &#8220;exploiting&#8221; colored folk for centuries or millennia (since about the year two, at least). The author of the article is quite right in pointing out some historical facts concerning exploitation and abuse of Whites by coloreds. However, the author didn&rsquo;t mentioned much about how much white people have helped colored people either. The ridding of the world of smallpox by &#8220;white-male&#8221; science alone has saved more colored lives than whites have taken in the entire history of the planet. It is an absolute fact that slavery was ended through the efforts of whites alone. No colored nation ever attempted to end slavery. Our system of human rights, democracy, free enterprise and science itself are white ideas that have (or could) blessed all people in countless ways. Dark-skinned people didn&rsquo;t invent these things and for the most part lived in horrible, barbaric societies. The author could have also gone into much further detail about dark-skinned people exploiting other dark-skinned people as well. This would show that in the balance of sins and transgressions white people come out rather well (better, I would say, than any other race).<br/>
The stupid, ignorant comedian seems to believe the liberal line that White people are &#8220;bad&#8221; and dark people are &#8220;good&#8221; and that someday coloreds will wreak their &#8220;just&#8221; revenge upon White people. The scary thing is that with our wretched educational system some ignorant people may actually believe his garbage &#8220;history&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I went down to the White Privilege Store last week to stock back up on some privilege. I&rsquo;ve been running low on such privilege of late.</p>
<p>Imagine my shock when the store manager said that he was completely out of his last remaining stock of white privilege.</p>
<p>I asked what happened.</p>
<p>Seems that corporate had told him that they no longer carry that line.</p>
<p>Well, what did he have in its place?</p>
<p>Some Affirmative Action privilege!</p>
<p>I asked if I could have some of that.</p>
<p>He checked the computer.  Then, with a look of chagrin on his face, he said he had to go back to the office and would be right back.</p>
<p>I waited at the counter, tapping my fingers.</p>
<p>The manager returned, and with a sad look on his face, explained to me that I &#8220;didn&rsquo;t qualify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides, he asked, didn&rsquo;t I notice that the sign on the store had changed?</p>
<p>It had? I asked, dumbfounded and now worried where I&rsquo;d get my next batch of white privilege.</p>
<p>Yep.  Corporate had changed the name to Affirmative Action Services, fitting those words into the same shaped logo. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.  Anyway, this was the manager&rsquo;s last week at the store.  Corporate was replacing him with someone &#8220;more appropriate&#8221; for the new image that they were trying to project. Some guy named DeShawn would be the new store manager or something.</p>
<p>I walked out of the store empty-handed, turned around and saw the big letters AAS on the sign. I wonder how they pronounce that?</p>
<p>Then I got back into my &#8216;95 Ford Taurus, ignoring the rust spots that I was privileged to have, and drove off.  Surely there&rsquo;d still be a White Privilege Store over in Mayberry, wouldn&rsquo;t there be?</p>

		<p>Concerning Asians..….<br/>
We DO have a debt to China. They own a lot of Treasury bills, and we are going to send billions of dollars their way when the Federal Govt collects taxes; that money will not be spent on USA infrastructure, rather it will be sent to China for their improvement. Any infrastructureal improvements here will have to be justifiable by bottom line considerations. And infrastructure includes education and health care.</p>
<p>With their billions of surplus dollars they are going to buy American productive assets, ie, companies.  So that Americans will work for them, indefinitely, and pay tax to them on their income, indefinitely.<br/>

Someone should ask this guy if he got where he is as a &#8216;comedian&rsquo; because of his own white privilege. I bet if you asked him that he&rsquo;d tell you he WORKED to be where he is on stage and on television.</p>
<p>And then ask him if he&rsquo;s willing to give up his career to make room for a non-white comedian who didn&rsquo;t have the same white privilege. Better yet DEMAND that he give up his spot to a non-white and watch the F-word fly.</p>

If there were such a thing as &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in the past, there certainly isn&rsquo;t any now. Any white person who applies for a job knows this.  I&rsquo;ve spoken with clearly liberal whites who become somewhat less obviously liberal when the discussion (in private; they won&rsquo;t say this publicly) moves around to the issue of them looking for a job.  Reality intrudes.  When you have rent and bills to pay, you probably wish that there actually was some white privilege to balance things out. You want a true level playing field where you can compete on the basis of your knowledge and skills.  But that level playing field is long since gone.  There is no justice, only social justice, which isn&rsquo;t justice at all.</p>
<p>So, anyone who still claims that there is such a thing as &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is someone so utterly ignorant and mentally deranged that it&rsquo;s impossible to have a rational discussion about this with them.</p>

		<p>The most amazing thing about &#8216;Unearned White Privilege&rsquo; is that it works best in places where there are only whites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the neatest thing about our &#8216;exploitation&rsquo; of blacks and browns: when we have absolutely no contact with them at all, and do our own work, our &#8216;Unearned White Privilege&rsquo; results in wonders like Europe&rsquo;s great cathedrals, Baroque architecture and interiors, Classical Music, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, Quantum Physics, The Industrial Revolution&hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;About nine years ago, I tested out the white privilege theory. I went to a BMW dealership in St. Louis, and asked the dealer to give me the most expensive 7-series sedan, ca. $140,000, because I had white skin privilege. He laughed,..&#8221;</p>
<p>We need some comics to ridicule &#8220;white privilege&#8221; openly - the above would be a good start for a skit.</p>

		<p>Visit the Council of Conservative Citizens&rsquo; web site, and find the link, on the lower left hand side, for &#8220;Lee In the Mountains&#8221;. </p>
<p>You will read a story there about how South African Farm Families have formed a Militia, to protect their families from being murdered by Black Gangs, intent on breaking into their homes and murdering them. </p>
<p>This looks like the impending future for the U.S., if things don&rsquo;t turn around swiftly. </p>
<p>Also, the South African Government is especially interested in disbanding the Farm Protection Units, and disarming the Farmers completely. Now, where have we heard that before?</p>

		<p>Loius CK is ghetto trash. He like every other black man wants to be white and is completely annoyed that he is not. It is unfortunate but US, Candian and Australian Universities prefer full fee paying asian students than loclas. Our Govts. underfund our tertiary education so they need to go offshore looking for students. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure asians are also over represented as cleaners, kitchen hands, prostitutes and service related jobs. It is not just asians but also hispanics and blacks who are more privileged than whites as affrmative action and political correctness does not support white communities. Whites are just the dumbass taxpayers of all this mess.</p>
<p>Where do I get a refund??</p>

		<p>Louis CK spouts the same nonsense every American is being fed lately. Too bad he never stopped to think about it. </p>
<p>*I&rsquo;d hate to be an Anglo-Saxon in the 11th and 12th centuries; <br/>
*I&rsquo;d hate to be Irish during the 19th century;<br/>
*I&rsquo;d hate to be any of the roughly one million Europeans captured, transported, and enslaved in North Africa; <br/>
*I&rsquo;d hate to be a Greek, Hungarian, Bulgar, or any of a wide number of nations subjugated by the Muslims for hundreds of years after the conquest of the Byzantine Empire<br/>
*I&rsquo;d hate to be a Russian under the oppression of the Tatars; <br/>
*I&rsquo;d hate to be Spanish during Moorish rule, relegated to second-class citizenship. At best; </p>
<p>The idea that whites have never been oppressed is complete nonsense. </p>

		<p>So was the abduction/rape/torture/murder that poor young Knoxville was treated to some of that &#8220;white priviledge&#8221; this foulmouthed lout refers to?</p>
<p>Is having to work as a welder out of my garage because nobody hires Americans as research chemists anymore when they can get cheaper Indians on H-1b visas - thanks to our Quisling senate - &#8220;white priviledge&#8221;?</p>
<p>The only priviledge I see here is that a talentless hack appears to make a good living swearing in front of a microphone, and that&rsquo;s only because the idiots who pay to see his &#8220;comedy&#8221; have more money than sense.</p>
