<h1>As Jaded As I Am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</h1>

	<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this really bothered me. The Washington Post had an op-ed today [see below] regarding the decision of the College Board to discontinue the AP exam for Latin literature, &#8220;which covers Cicero and four lyric poets.&#8221; Buried in the penultimate paragraph, and stated not at all uncritically, is this sentence: &#8220;The College Board said this decision was related to the number of minority students taking the exam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if the exam should have been continued or not, but it is very sad if the reason it was discontinued was because the racial mix of students taking it was politically incorrect, and it is equally sad if this is considered an acceptable reason even by a teacher who is otherwise outraged at the College Board&rsquo;s action. O tempora, o mores!<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/13/AR2009051303254.html">Et Tu, College Board?</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jane Miriam Epperson Brinley, Washington Post, May 14, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Across the nation, Latin programs are changing because the College Board announced last spring that while it would continue the other Latin AP exam, which covers Virgil, May 2009 would be the last time it offered the Latin lit exam, which covers Cicero and four lyric poets. While specific figures are not yet available, it seems likely that this decision by the testing giant will lead to significant enrollment declines and reduced course offerings across the country. In effect, our entire discipline is reduced to the study of a single  &mdash;  admittedly great  &mdash;  author, Virgil. In the gap created by our national reluctance to centralize education policy, the College Board, an unelected body, has ended up as the de facto Education Ministry, and when it makes decisions we have no recourse.</p>
<p>With the termination of the AP Latin literature exam, high school programs nationwide will change. Because AP exams set the standard of academic quality for college-bound students, high school curricula are often reverse-engineered to prepare students for AP tests. So principals who have been willing to support small Latin programs because they added to the number of bodies in AP seats or AP scores about which they could boast are likely to decide that the Latin program&rsquo;s resources can be better spent elsewhere. Teachers who have nurtured multiyear programs that keep students engaged until they can tackle Catullus&rsquo;s hendecasyllabics will then throw in the towel. Parents who have encouraged their children to stick with Latin because they could add this AP Latin score to their transcript will decide that Junior should look for something more alluring to college admissions officers.</p>
<p>The College Board&rsquo;s curriculum-setting role goes beyond the AP course itself. Latin courses for elementary schools (a growth area), middle schools and high schools will now change, and textbooks will change along with them. Since teachers favor textbooks that lay the groundwork for the advanced study their programs anticipate, they have recently been selecting series that emphasize, for example, Catullus&rsquo;s vocabulary and themes  &mdash;  love, manners and literary issues  &mdash;  over those that emphasize, say, Caesar&rsquo;s (politics and war). But now textbook publishers are likely to revise their products, and teachers will gradually replace their books to reflect the single-author focus of the remaining Latin AP exam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until recently, many believed that the College Board felt responsible to the public good, but its termination of the Latin literature test and a few others that served only a few thousand students nationwide suggests that this is really about money. The College Board said this decision was related to the number of minority students taking the exam. But when it ended its Italian exam, a decision announced at the same time with the same excuse, the College Board (with annual revenue of half a billion dollars) left that decision open to reversal if supporters of the Italian exam could raise $1.5 million. (They could not.) Meanwhile, Latin, revered by Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders  &mdash;  John Adams declaimed the speeches of Cicero, once even in a toga  &mdash;  has been placed in the hands of a bunch of administrative functionaries.</p>

		<p>It is not sad that blacks cannot advance in Latin; it is sad that Whites shut down other Whites who were showing mastery.</p>
<p>But, after all, all men are created equal, so if blacks cannot advance in Latin, it must be due to some pernicious influence.</p>
<p>Also, it is good that the Whites have, as it were, girded themselves with a towel and stooped down in holy humility to wash the feet of their black brothers.</p>
<p>(The last two statements about equality and humility were delivered in boiling-hot sarcasm, by a person who took three years of latin in high school, and two years in college.) </p>
<p>Let us all be equal, which means: The least of these thy brethren will rule over everyone. EVERYONE.</p>
<p>The insanity continues and will soon turn into terror, because Whites have lost their (beep!). No! They have voluntarily cut off their own (beep!)! </p>
<p>Latin? Mighty Rome? Yes, bring back the Graeco-Roman philosophers! They would have much to say about our malady, especially Celsus and Porphory, who warned against the dangers of the altruistic practices of the Christians. These practices have a strong, if undefined, influence on our culture, and their origin is only vaguely felt.</p>
<p>It is everywhere, like some vague, undefined belief in UFO&rsquo;s and aliens.</p>
<p>Small ideas, like transistors, controlling much bigger flows of power.  </p>

		<p>     Why would minorities want to study the ancient roots of<br>
our culture? They study our modern sciences in order to make<br>
money or gain power for themselves and their Country. They show<br>
very little interest in our Arts and Literature in general. The<br>
truly amazing thing is that our Academics find this amazing. <br>
Where did they get the idea that you can change the racial com-<br>
position of a country and not change the culture? The minorities<br>
will take our Culture and adapt it for their own use. For example, Africans play bass guitar as a percussion intrument. If<br>
they can&rsquo;t adapt it, they will delete it. Classical Studies I<br>
would say, will be thrown in the trash heap. An interesting ex-<br>
ception to all this, is the Japanese love of our Classical Music.<br>
They embrace the discipline and have produced musicians of great<br>
technical proficiency though often lacking the inner spirit. YoYo<br>
Ma is an exception to this being a Master of both the technique<br>
and the spirit.<br>

		<p>Unless it is absolutely necessary, avoid college.  Science or engineering, OK, and the teaching bureaucracy will force you to squeeze through their programs, but for the most part, a B.A. degree is a ticket to a life spent in an office doing make work.  If you&rsquo;re smart enough to get into college (without remedial courses), you&rsquo;re smart enough to make a living by skilled labor.  If you want an active mental life, turn off the TV, read good books, and talk to smart people.  <br>
     It is my hope that the BHO regime will be unable to hold this shipwreck of a country together for long, and that the economy will no longer be able to reward the idlers at their keyboards.  I could make a good living teaching useful skills to ex-stockbrokers and former directors of human resources.</p>

		<p>The Post editorial not only avoids criticism of the diversity mentality, but suggests, in all seriousness, that a centralized education ministry would be more responsible to high culture than the College Board. It is more likely that non white values in the curriculum would enjoy a great victory on the day education is centralized. For it is easy to imagine how the doctrines of political correctness would come exercise a sort of absolute sway over the spirit of such a monstrous bureaucracy. </p>

		<p>I work (but not teach) at a state university &amp; am occasionally exposed to student compositions.  The degree of illiteracy is staggering.  American young people of all races can barely write an English sentence, much less a composition, that is not littered with errors of all kinds: grammatical, punctuation, spelling, logic, you name it.  The hand-written stuff is painful to look at.  These students have attended school for 12 years &amp; most have not mastered their native language above the must fundamental level.   </p>
<p>Truly, we are screwed. </p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re living in the age of the antithesis of the European Renaissance. The Renaissance movement, which led to the Age of Enlightenment and the subsequent ascendancy of Whites as masters of the globe, had been spawned by a return to the Greek and Roman classics. The West conquered the world by abandoning superstition and embracing logic. The ancients were in the minds of our great conquerors and heroes, speaking to them in their original tongues.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century schools abandoned teaching the classics. The result was the substitution of wisdom for knowledge. People now know the minutiae of passing technology but do not have a grasp of eternal principals. Modern Westerners are technical and overfull of information yet without virtue or reason. The people of the West lost their minds when they lost the classics. The doctrines of the worldwide socialist movement   &mdash;  propagandized on an industrial scale in the 20th century  &mdash;   filled the void left by the removal of the classical curriculum. In effect, socialism&rsquo;s maxims became the morals of the West.</p>
<p>There are very effective classical education programs still in existence. Look to colleges or universities using a &#8220;Great Books&#8221; curriculum, that is, colleges that teach directly from the great books of Western Civilization. For a list of such books, see the Wikipedia article of the same name. By educating yourself in such a way, you remove the often-biased modern textbook&rsquo;s &#8220;frame&#8221; and hear unaltered the wisdom the ancients wished to impart to the inheritors of the West.</p>

		<p>I taught at an international school in Europe for three years. The school had students from about 60 nations. Instruction was in English. Which nationality was the worst in ENGLISH? Which nationality was the worst at mathematics? It will come as no surprise to the readers of AmRen that the answer to both questions is &#8220;American&#8221;. Worse yet, when I returned to the States to teach at an American college, I told these facts to one of my classes. Were they ashamed that their fellow countrymen were last in everything intellectual? No at all, the whole class laughed!!! I think that the worst thing about the American educational system and American society in general is that the idea that it is okay to ignorant and stupid. <br>
Whatever, Dude!<br>
Recently, I received an article from a colleague that stated that Hindi and other Indian languages are being pushed in schools in England because they are complex and exacting languages and the learning of them is supposed to be good exercises for student&rsquo;s minds. I wrote back to my colleague asking what happened to the teaching of Latin in England, which was once taught for the very same reasons. <br>
I received no reply.  <br>

<p>Actually, I do everything I can to help my teenage daughter be as racially conscious as I can. Luckily my ex-wife doesn&rsquo;t oppose that and in fact does as much as she can to teach our daughter to be wary. But it is a struggle in this environment. We do have to take our own kids in hand and at least partially home-school them, to at the very least undo the damage from their brain-dead teachers.</p>

		<p>I have never commented before on a story posted here, however, this is on a subject so near and dear to me I must.</p>
<p>Before me, someone mentioned Great Books Curriculum. Well, I recently finished my freshman year at one of these schools and the study of classics has so altered me that I am now one of it&rsquo;s fiercest defenders.</p>
<p>I would have to disagree with Schoolteacher; training in technical skills is satisfactory enough to survive, but not what created the mighty Western World. JTaverner has put forth pretty much what I would say; the hellenistic world and its classics are the path to greatness.</p>
<p>Last year I  graduated high school. I was always an encyclopedia and it saw me through. I could store in my head all the answers to every test. I got a respectable 32 on my ACTs through my astounding ability to regurgitate information. This year I was finally able purge myself of that &#8216;gift&rsquo;. What matters is not being able to memorize, but to reason, to challenge, to defend, and to understand.</p>
<p>Reading Plato and Aristotle has awakened in me the ability to think. It means so much to be able to read texts where ideas are put forth and considered, rather than to pour over text books or lecture notes where answers are given. None of this would have happened if I did not go to college, but perhaps only the right college is worth attending.</p>
<p>My friends make fun of my school when I explain that I study Ptolemy and Galen, but when I hear  how their schools run, I pity them. My friend had to take a class where they learned &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;, another had to memorize who was held various positions in world governments, and others simply slept through classes and crammed for finals. I may live to regret receiving a more or less useless degree in the eyes of employers, but I will not regret my education. I truly fear, as Schoolteacher suggests will happen to me, working in an office. I hope that studying the liberal arts will truly liberate me from the mundane, materialistic, uncultured American Dream.</p>
<p>I do not study Latin; I study greek, and not very well, but I do feel that any opportunity to study the classics that is lost, is a grave blow. I am not a white supremacist or separatist like many on this site; I simply feel a great sadness and anger towards whiny minorities and those who cave to their weaknesses rather than encourage overcoming them. My college is likely more than ninety percent white, we read two minority authors out of a total of perhaps a hundred or more, and we unabashedly ignore historical, marxist, feminist, or afrocentric analysis of what we read. I pray to God it will not be forced to change because of the above.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for rambling, and let me say, I make no claim to wisdom. I only wish to say, it seems to me that the study of the classics is most worthwhile and it is tragic that this opportunity was lost for high school students of Latin in the name of diversity.</p>

the musicians play bass guitar as a perucssion instrument. And<br>
it works. In little else perhaps, but the Black is his own Man<br>

     Along with John and John Quincy Adams, Minister Farakhan graduated number 1 from Boston Latin High School. He attributes his absolute command of the English language to his latin training, of course his 150 IQ doesn`t hurt. When asked why he could quote more Shakespeare than the Sacred Koran, he said,&#8221; To destroy the power of the white man I will need to know his langauge better than he does.&#8221;<br>
     Maybe all you inbred white racists, like me, ought to agree that Latin has to go for our own good. Of course I`d rather have Farakhan`s people rule us than homo-sexual white athiest liberals.<br>

<p>In the middle of an otherwise great post, and definitely not a &#8220;rant&#8221; in mine eyes, that&rsquo;s a rather condescending thing to say.  Do you not realize that opposition to white supremacy or separatism is the very force that has dismantled real education at formerly great educational institutions, such that your &#8220;friends&#8221; sneer at you?  The same force that &#8220;integrated&#8221; South Africa and Alabama went right to Stanford and took away Western Civ and put in its place Tolerance Studies.  Globalism is globalism.</p>

		<p>I teach courses as an &#8220;adjunct&#8221; instructor at a relatively small midwestern college. I&rsquo;ve had to assign short essays, which I dread doing.  Even though the students write their essays on their computers, which have spell-check, their papers are still full of errors of all kinds.  They don&rsquo;t spell check.  Their grammar is practically nonexistent. Every other English mistake is made.  The logic and reasoning is childlike at best.  The race or ethnicity of the student hardly matters:  It&rsquo;s all bad   &mdash;   except for the essays from the occasional foreign student whose command of English is inevitably far superior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to teach the American kids Latin.  For them, English is a foreign language when it comes to writing and thinking. </p>

		<p>I received an article from a colleague that stated that Hindi and other Indian languages are being pushed in schools in England because they are complex and exacting languages </p>
<p>NO! they are NOT exacting. These languages have no words for technical terms or practices, they use the ENGLISH words as does ARABIC which ALSO has no words for the terms we take for granted in the West. Those languages are begionning to be taught in the U.K simply because SO MANY FROM THAT COUNTRY ARE IN the Emerald Isles. I deal with these languges all time and I know!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The degree of illiteracy is staggering. American young people of all races can barely write an English sentence&hellip;These students have attended school for 12 years &amp; most have not mastered their native language above the must fundamental level&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that:  </p>
<p>The teachers that teach them in the K-12 educational-industrial complex can barely write a sentence!  Their writing, including those with so-called advanced degrees is painful to read  &mdash;  misspellings of common words, misuse of possessives, elementary mistakes (mixing up its and it&rsquo;s, your and you&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re their and there, weather and whether) and so on.</p>
<p>There was an unbelievable drive to de-emphasize grammar and syntax in the 80s as part of the same drive to recruit more NAM teachers  &mdash;  some of whom are barely literate or understandable.  The mechanics of the English Language were seen as &#8216;irrelevant&rsquo; as long as the teacher could garner some understanding of the underlying ideas the students were writing about.  Some ed schools mandated that red pens/pencils not be used lest a student became &#8216;intimidated&rsquo; by all the red marks (I&rsquo;m not making this up).  Proper grammar and spelling were sneered at as being &#8216;restrictive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Holistic&rsquo; grading of students&rsquo; written work in the classroom and on state tests used to measure &#8216;literacy&rsquo; became the norm.  Graders were told to ignore grammatical errors, spelling, common punctuation errors, syntactical errors and to &#8216;seek the underlying ideas&rsquo; of the essays (no matter how lame).  Essays displaying little or no understanding of anything were routinely passed.  Remember the prevailing dogma of the educational system:  If the scores of NAMs are not the same as the scores of Whites/Asians, the tests are racist.  NO other explanation is acceptable.</p>
<p>I spent one year teaching so-called gifted high school students and dreaded grading their essays because they fiercely defended their sloppy writing, lack of knowledge of basic grammar and spelling and cliche-ridden ideas that they thought were brilliant and evidence of great, deep thinking.  This is because they&rsquo;d been told their for their entire short lives that they were geniuses, the world was theirs and that they could do &#8216;anything they set their minds to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s not just English where students struggle.  One of my relatives teaches math at a large, very prestigious university in California.  He tells me many freshmen students cannot compute well and struggle with basic math, especially fractions.</p>

		<p>To those of you who see white American students&rsquo; relative lack in language proficiency:  I think the answer is twofold:</p>
<p>(1)  Mainly to pander to black and (to a lesser extent) Hispanic low IQs, the general overall curriculum, language and otherwise, has been slowly dumbed down.  This marginally hurts whites.</p>
<p>(2)  Even though there are extravagant amounts of money spent by the official literacy-industrial complex on the concepts of literacy education, it doesn&rsquo;t work very well.  Until recently, phonics was shunned for various &#8220;whole language,&#8221; &#8220;see-and-say,&#8221; or &#8220;holistic&#8221; methods.  The reason for it is that The System really doesn&rsquo;t want people to learn how to read, based on the rantings and ravings of kook neo-Marxist American university professors that say that &#8220;reading is bourgeoise,&#8221; and that it&rsquo;s a hurdle to government-run social experimentation.  If you read, you might not liberal Democrat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not sad that blacks cannot advance in Latin; it is sad that Whites shut down other Whites who were showing mastery.</p>
<p>But, after all, all men are created equal, so if blacks cannot advance in Latin, it must be due to some pernicious influence.</p>
<p>Also, it is good that the Whites have, as it were, girded themselves with a towel and stooped down in holy humility to wash the feet of their black brothers.</p>
<p>(The last two statements about equality and humility were delivered in boiling-hot sarcasm, by a person who took three years of latin in high school, and two years in college.) </p>
<p>Let us all be equal, which means: The least of these thy brethren will rule over everyone. EVERYONE.</p>
<p>The insanity continues and will soon turn into terror, because Whites have lost their (beep!). No! They have voluntarily cut off their own (beep!)! </p>
<p>Latin? Mighty Rome? Yes, bring back the Graeco-Roman philosophers! They would have much to say about our malady, especially Celsus and Porphory, who warned against the dangers of the altruistic practices of the Christians. These practices have a strong, if undefined, influence on our culture, and their origin is only vaguely felt.</p>
<p>It is everywhere, like some vague, undefined belief in UFO&rsquo;s and aliens.</p>
<p>Small ideas, like transistors, controlling much bigger flows of power. &#8220;</p>
<p>Thank you, Miss Vendredie Prochain!  You eloquently reassert the theme that I have been hammering on via this site for years; Christianity and White insistence on it as part of a successful White future is a HUGE error.  Christianity in fact, is the root of the White European illness of spirit that has it marching to its destruction.  </p>
<p>Many posters hate it when I point out the violence done to Europeans by and through the Christian conquest.  I always advocate a new religion for those who need it - based on European pre-Christian models.  At least they saw their own land as sacred and their own people as important as who and what they were.  Many objectors know little or nothing about them, falling into the well-trained Christian reaction (witches, pagans, heathens!) but the very philosophers you quote had influence on many of them.  Knowledge of the Graeco-Roman outlooks had reached as far as Scandinavia before Christianity arrived, using the same intellectual pathways - with its trickery and culture destroying practices - not to mention its later inquisitions.  </p>
<p>Regard Islam, Judaism and even Eastern Orthodox Christianity; they all succeded in linking their religion with their ancestral lands.  Christianity took over indigenous European (West) gods and holy places with a Middle Eastern lore that was only slightly Hellenistic or Roman in structure.  It divorced the people from their land.  Once you have no sacred ground, you have lost a leg of the tripod of culture.  It took a very long time to destroy the Europeans love for their own land and people, however, the major cause of this has been the religion that calls on people to forget their earthly connections and look to a promised &#8220;eternity.&#8221;  This has served as a great ploy as that very religious movement seized power and wealth - and control - here on the material plane.</p>
<p>The White man needs to be spiritually free in order to survive. He needs to use all that great intellect to become truly objective in reviewing his condition and likely paths to survival.  Truly, some learning from the past would help a great deal.  A good start would be for all would-be White race realists would be to read Gibbons&rsquo; classic; &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The White man must be free to be encouraged by his own natural culture for his kind&rsquo;s survival.  The problems of the NT and its many contradictions in theory and practice are a huge stumbling block to this end.  Oswald Spengler made the central issue of this in his &#8220;Decline of the West.&#8221;  Think about it.</p>

		<p>16 Anonymous, any chance you&rsquo;re going to Thomas Aquinas College out in California?  Good for you, whatever honest college you&rsquo;ve gotten into.  But most students are stuck in multi-cultural degree mills, and the trade school/library card option is their best bet.  Even if they don&rsquo;t educate themselves by good reading, most are better off not going to a four year school at all.  It&rsquo;s better to be uneducated than to be falsely educated.  Honest, useful labor will teach them a lot in a few years anyway.</p>

I decided on Latin because I didn&rsquo;t think the Hispanic civilization had anything to teach me compared with the Ancient Romans; besides, I wanted to be able to read my church missal at the traditional Catholic Church I attend.

		<p>I work (but not teach) at a state university &amp; am occasionally exposed to student compositions. The degree of illiteracy is staggering.

<p>&#8220;Along with John and John Quincy Adams, Minister Farakhan graduated number 1 from Boston Latin High School. He attributes his absolute command of the English language to his latin training, of course his 150 IQ doesn`t hurt. When asked why he could quote more Shakespeare than the Sacred Koran, he said,&rdquo; To destroy the power of the white man I will need to know his langauge better than he does.&rdquo;<br>
Maybe all you inbred white racists, like me, ought to agree that Latin has to go for our own good. Of course I`d rather have Farakhan`s people rule us than homo-sexual white athiest liberals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles B. Tiffany<br>
Kissimmee, Florida </p>
<p>A fan of Farakhan I see&hellip;.  Rather be killed off directly or by genetic domination by a Black Muslim than live with one &#8220;liberal&#8221; - (one man&rsquo;s liberal is another&rsquo;s conservative) - or an atheist - heaven forbid that your fantasy religion should be proven nothing more than a myth!</p>
<p>I watched several of Mr. Farakhan&rsquo;s speeches during the height of his anti-White campaigns.  In one of them, he sought to use this IQ you allege, to reason that Blacks are better than Whites genetically.  &#8220;The White man fears extinction!&#8221; he said.  But he obviously had no knowledge of genetic science.  He claimed that Black skin and brown eyes are &#8220;dominant&#8221; traits, while White skin and blue eyes are recessive.  All to the acollades of his Black audience - not realizing the meaning of his words.  The term tranmuted from a scientific term to a political one by his &#8220;charisma&#8221; but not his intelligence.  In genetic language used in this context dominant means the least mutated and therefore the older, more stable trait.  In the context of race differences, it means that Whites are the most evolved of human species - the latest model, if you like, while Blacks represent the oldest, more undifferentiated - primitive set of genetics on the planet.  </p>
<p>At the time I laughed at his error and idiotic reasoning.  But I knew that ignorant Whites would also be taken in. Things are to such a state than whenever a Black shows up, everyone gives up trying to compete.  Farakhan may have been in error, but his political manipulation has been largely effective.  It has been effective because too many Whites think more of their religion than they do of real education - an education that would have prevented Farakhan&rsquo;s words to ever gain so much as a toehold in the public mind or discourse.</p>
<p>But you would rather burn books and see the White race go to your imagined afterlife than change the type of government you demand or question the faith you so blindly wish us all to die for&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The concept of freedom and individual responsibility is a uniquely white trait that is ingrained in white DNA.<br>
Blacks embrace collectivism (communism).  Most Asians embrace fatalism (whatever will be will be).  It is the White cultural understanding of freedom and individual responsibility that have made the USA the powerhouse of the world.  So-called &#8220;public education&#8221; is doing a great job of stamping out the two white concepts as noted above.  Add to that the canard of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and we have a recipe for disaster.  &#8220;Diversity for thee (whites) but not for me&#8221; (all other races) seems to be the standard of the day.<br>
It seems that a black former politician (J. C. Watts) said it best:<br>
Blacks are good at celebration<br>
Asians can put a computer on the head of a pin<br>
Whites are good at administration<br>

Exactly! I can say precisely the same.<br>
In English I could  bluff it, but not in Latin. Either you know it or you don&rsquo;t. You have to work. No faking.  And Latin prepared me for other languages as well, even non-Romance languages. It gives you a comprehension of the structure of language. I only wish I had taken much more of it. I&rsquo;d like to take it up again today. Just sit by the window and read Cicero.<br>

		<p>     Much as I love it, Christianity is problematic because of<br>
its universality. Most Christian Academics posit an absolute <br>
identity between Christianity and Western Culture. Whatever Wes-<br>
