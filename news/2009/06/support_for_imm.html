<h1>Support for Immigration Slipping </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Thompson, Standard-Freeholder (Cornwall, Ont.), June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of Canadians who say immigration has a positive effect on their community has dropped &#8220;noticeably&#8221; over the past two years and is now at the lowest level since the government started tracking attitudes in 2004. </p>
<p>A public opinion poll conducted for the immigration department earlier this year found there is still strong support among most Canadians for immigration and most Canadians consider immigration beneficial. But it also showed signs that support might be slipping. </p>
<p>The last time the department conducted a tracking poll in August 2007, 59% of respondents said immigration had a very positive or somewhat positive impact on their community compared to 50 per cent in January 2009. </p>
<p>The poll also showed a slight drop in the belief that cultural diversity strengthens Canadian culture. While a majority of Canadians, 55%, agreed with it, that was down from a high of 61% in July 2004. </p>
<p>The poll also found a shift when it came to the challenges that newcomers face. The number of respondents who identified employment as a top challenge rose to its highest level since they started tracking it in 2005. While language was cited as a top challenge, those who cited employment rose to 40% from 15% in November 2006. </p>
<p>In general, the more educated the respondents, the more they favoured immigration. The poll also found regional differences, with residents of Ontario (32%) and Alberta (29%) more likely to think too many immigrants are coming to Canada versus Atlantic Canada where only 16% felt that way. </p>
<p>The poll showed 82% supported allowing temporary workers to gain permanent resident status once they have worked in Canada a few years but little sympathy for undocumented or illegal immigrants. The poll found 67% believe undocumented workers should be deported  &mdash;  with Alberta coming in highest at 74%.<br>

		<p>In my experience, the number one cause of &#8220;racism&#8221; is the intermingling of races. Most Canadians who still support immigration probably live in lilly white neighborhoods. The balance of opinion will no doubt shift against immigration once Canada is as saturated with third world invaders as California. Unfortunately, by the time this happens it will be too late to reverse the damage.</p>

		<p>Maybe the drop in support for diversity had something to do with Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8216;banned in Halifax&rsquo; speech and the subsequent media attention. Click on the Canadian flag on the front page to find out. </p>

		<p>What will happen is by the time most native Canadians realize how third world immigration is turning their country into the sort of trash heap like the countries so many of these immigrants come from, it will be too late, as they will likely be close to being a minority themselves at that point, and their political power to make the proper changes will be lost forever.</p>

		<p>The reason that opposition to immigration is highest in Ontario and Alberta is because that&rsquo;s where most of the third world immigrants head to. The Atlantic provinces are very largely white, with very restricted third world immigration, so it&rsquo;s quite easy for residents there to smile upon multiculturalism and cultural invasion, as it&rsquo;s not something they have to put up with. White residents of Toronto, now a minority in Canada&rsquo;s biggest metropolis, would see it entirely differently.</p>
<p>Here on the Canadian prairies, it&rsquo;s now shocking to see women in chadors and burkas striding around in a couple of the largest cities. This is redneck country, and I wonder to myself, &#8220;What happened?!?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is because the more educated (read, better paid) don&rsquo;t have to live with the riff-raff coming in as &#8220;immigrants&#8221; especially hostile african or Paki muslims.</p>

		<p>Anybody that thinks cultural diversity&hellip;.or any other kind for that matter&hellip;.strengthens a country is either mentally retarded or brainwashed thoroughly.   I&rsquo;d like to run into several of them so I could sell all of them shares in the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also got some solid land to sell them, if they don&rsquo;t mind about 20 feet of water over it, filled with alligators.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I. &amp; Newfoundland simply don&rsquo;t have an inordinate number of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; that warrant much attention, hence their high approval ratings. It need not be explained here that today&rsquo;s immigrants can be interpreted to mean &#8220;visible minorities&#8221;. </p>
<p>In fact, several <a href="http://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2007/12/28/happiest-city-in-canada/" rel="nofollow"><b>Atlantic Canadian cities</b></a> scored well in a recent satisfaction study sponsored by the <i>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</i> probably because 90%-95% of their population consist of White Canadians. </p>

		<p>Well life under the conservatives and harper is not any better than under the liberals.</p>
<p>In fact when the liberals were in power, the foreigners stuck to the big three like Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.</p>
<p>Now we see in smaller communities a BIG influx of blacks.</p>
<p>I will never vote for a conservative representative again.</p>
<p>White people are truly the most unintelligent group you could ever find.  Nothing but bleeding hearts that think multi-culturalism and diversity are great.</p>
<p>Ya, it is ok when there is one of them to a thousand of us.</p>
<p>Those were the good old days.</p>
<p>Harper and his group of traitors will lose the next election.</p>

Sounds like Liberal attitudes again.Liberalism has the seeds of its own(and that of Societys) destruction.Oscar Wilde once wrote,<br>
&#8216;Education is an admirable thing but it is good to remember from time to time,that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught&rsquo;.<br>
I am from England and the sense of being invaded by these unwanted foreigners,just as if they are an invading Army,grows stronger and stronger in me each day.There are places in my own town now were I will not venture because of them.</p>

		<p>To commenter # 4 I agree 100%. I too ask myself &#8220;What Happened?&#8221; I mean what happened. I am simply stunned that we allow non-European immigrants in when it is quite obvious that they are a burden and have primitive, violent tendencies.</p>
<p>My country used to be the envy of the world and a proud member of the Anglosphere. Yet our &#8220;genius&#8221; &#8220;Leaders&#8221; decided to mess with a good thing in the 1960s and now we have a disaster on our hands.</p>

<p>In grande military terms, Ontario would be called a &#8220;beach Head&#8221;<br>
after which, comes the REAL invasion. Stop them on the beach or they will never be stopped, just ask the Germans and Japanese.</p>
