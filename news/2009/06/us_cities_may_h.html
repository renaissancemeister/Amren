<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The government looking at expanding a pioneering scheme in Flint, one of the poorest US cities, which involves razing entire districts and returning the land to nature.</p>
<p>Local politicians believe the city must contract by as much as 40 per cent, concentrating the dwindling population and local services into a more viable area.</p>
<p>The radical experiment is the brainchild of Dan Kildee, treasurer of Genesee County, which includes Flint.</p>
<p>Having outlined his strategy to Barack Obama during the election campaign, Mr Kildee has now been approached by the US government and a group of charities who want him to apply what he has learnt to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Mr Kildee said he will concentrate on 50 cities, identified in a recent study by the Brookings Institution, an influential Washington think-tank, as potentially needing to shrink substantially to cope with their declining fortunes.</p>
<p>Most are former industrial cities in the &#8220;rust belt&#8221; of America&rsquo;s Mid-West and North East. They include Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Memphis.</p>
<p>In Detroit, shattered by the woes of the US car industry, there are already plans to split it into a collection of small urban centres separated from each other by countryside.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real question is not whether these cities shrink  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re all shrinking  &mdash;  but whether we let it happen in a destructive or sustainable way,&#8221; said Mr Kildee. &#8220;Decline is a fact of life in Flint. Resisting it is like resisting gravity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karina Pallagst, director of the Shrinking Cities in a Global Perspective programme at the University of California, Berkeley, said there was &#8220;both a cultural and political taboo&#8221; about admitting decline in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Places like Flint have hit rock bottom. They&rsquo;re at the point where it&rsquo;s better to start knocking a lot of buildings down,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Flint, sixty miles north of Detroit, was the original home of General Motors. The car giant once employed 79,000 local people but that figure has shrunk to around 8,000.</p>
<p>Unemployment is now approaching 20 per cent and the total population has almost halved to 110,000.</p>
<p>The exodus  &mdash;  particularly of young people  &mdash;  coupled with the consequent collapse in property prices, has left street after street in sections of the city almost entirely abandoned.</p>
<p>In the city centre, the once grand Durant Hotel  &mdash;  named after William Durant, GM&rsquo;s founder  &mdash;  is a symbol of the city&rsquo;s decline, said Mr Kildee. The large building has been empty since 1973, roughly when Flint&rsquo;s decline began.</p>
<p>Regarded as a model city in the motor industry&rsquo;s boom years, Flint may once again be emulated, though for very different reasons.</p>
<p>But Mr Kildee, who has lived there nearly all his life, said he had first to overcome a deeply ingrained American cultural mindset that &#8220;big is good&#8221; and that cities should sprawl  &mdash;  Flint covers 34 square miles.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The obsession with growth is sadly a very American thing. Across the US, there&rsquo;s an assumption that all development is good, that if communities are growing they are successful. If they&rsquo;re shrinking, they&rsquo;re failing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some Flint dustcarts are collecting just one rubbish bag a week, roads are decaying, police are very understaffed and there were simply too few people to pay for services, he said.</p>
<p>If the city didn&rsquo;t downsize it will eventually go bankrupt, he added.</p>
<p>Flint&rsquo;s recovery efforts have been helped by a new state law passed a few years ago which allowed local governments to buy up empty properties very cheaply.</p>
<p>They could then knock them down or sell them on to owners who will occupy them. The city wants to specialise in health and education services, both areas which cannot easily be relocated abroad.</p>
<p>The local authority has restored the city&rsquo;s attractive but formerly deserted centre but has pulled down 1,100 abandoned homes in outlying areas.</p>
<p>Mr Kildee estimated another 3,000 needed to be demolished, although the city boundaries will remain the same.</p>
<p>Already, some streets peter out into woods or meadows, no trace remaining of the homes that once stood there.</p>
<p>Choosing which areas to knock down will be delicate but many of them were already obvious, he said.</p>
<p>The city is buying up houses in more affluent areas to offer people in neighbourhoods it wants to demolish. Nobody will be forced to move, said Mr Kildee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of the land will be given back to nature. People will enjoy living near a forest or meadow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Kildee acknowledged that some fellow Americans considered his solution &#8220;defeatist&#8221; but he insisted it was &#8220;no more defeatist than pruning an overgrown tree so it can bear fruit again&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Detroit is already going this way; large areas of the city look virtually like rural areas.  And even some larger buildings that have been abandoned have become nests for birds of prey never really seen in cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely the fault of economic decline and deindustrialization, though that is part of it.  The other reason is race.</p>

		<p>Reading these comments would leave one to believe that these vast urban centers were simply depopulated as people packed up and abandoned well-tended houses and neighborhoods. The truth is that these areas were devastated by (mainly) black crime which made normal life simply impossible for normal people.  </p>
<p>Had these areas not been reduced to something that looks eerily like contemporary Mogadishu, falling housing demand would have rendered decently maintained neighborhoods affordable to millions of law-abiding lower income families seeking starter homes. Of course, the neighborhoods were destroyed and the law-abiding lower income families fled, as best they could, for their lives.  </p>

		<p>Non-white post 1965 immigrants and their geneline account for 100 percent of current and future population growth. If the 1965 immigration act had not been passed the US popualtion would have stabilized at 250 million and America would b 90 percent Native Born White.</p>
<p>In addition to a stabilized population at 250 million and Native Born White Americans being  90 percent of the population, America would be a labor self-sufficient nation. Why would any of these three things been terrible? Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been terrible..as far as Native Born White American racail interests go. What would have been so terrible about America being labor self-sufficient? If America was labor self-sufficient, Native Born White Americans would be paid a high real wage. Of course, this is the reason why the greedy cheating class-owners of the Republican and Democratic parties-revolted against Native Born America and imported scab labor from india,pakistan,china,mexico,turkey,iran,mexico and other nations&hellip;to transfer wealth from ordinary Native Born White Americans to the greedy cheating class&hellip; </p>

		<p>I agree with this guy that it is a very American thing to think that growth is good. If not for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 our population would not have increased very much.</p>

		<p>And of course the real reason for Flint&rsquo;s decline will never be discussed. Wikipedia includes a paragraph about the supposed terrible racism in Flint&rsquo;s history, but does not give the current racial makeup of the city. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even use correct terms to describe geographic areas of the US. Flint is said to be in the &#8220;rust belt&#8221; but if there is something magical about the particular region the city is in, then why are suburbs in that same area doing fine? It&rsquo;s the people living there that make the difference, not the location along some mysterious &#8220;belt.&#8221; </p>
<p>No doubt this &#8220;turning the city back to nature&#8221; will be &#8220;spun&#8221; as an environmental success, but it is really an environmental disaster, It&rsquo;s accompanied by sprawl into other areas and a terrible waste of resources.</p>

It&rsquo;s essentially happening here in Buffalo. Large tracks of old housing and dilapidated industrial buildings on the black &#8216;east side&rsquo; (formerly the Polish east side) are being demolished and new housing built. </p>
<p>You can see what&rsquo;s being done by going to google maps (an amazing piece of web technology), typing in the address below and then click on &#8216;street view&rsquo;</p>
<p>376 Sycamore St, Buffalo, Erie, New York 14204</p>
<p>Rotate the map to see just how large an area is being bulldozed. It&rsquo;s so desolate, you&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;s a rural landscape.</p>
<p>When the Poles inhabited this neighborhood it was a bustling and thriving community. Now it&rsquo;s a wasteland. Literally.</p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder who the inhabitants of these areas are or were???</p>
<p>Actually it doesnt sound like a bad idea. Except for one minor detail: </p>
<p>&#8220;The city is buying up houses in more affluent areas to offer people in neighbourhoods it wants to demolish. Nobody will be forced to move, said Mr Kildee.&#8221;</p>
<p>My question is who is currently residing in these &#8220;more affluent areas&#8221; and how do they feel about their soon to be new neighbors?</p>

		<p>i would love to see the revival of cities in America. history shows us that a rural people or movement is ultimately doomed to extinction or obscurity. unfortunately it&rsquo;s probably safe to say that these plans for revitalizing our cities will not take race into account, if anything it will encourage more diversity. and any whites that do return to the city will probably be similar to the ones who already live there: rich, extremely liberal, and with no racial consciousness. i live in Raleigh, NC and that is exactly what is happening to downtown. whites are returning but they aren&rsquo;t creating the city culture of old, they are creating the current liberal city culture: fancy cafes, gay districts, trendy ethnic restaurants, extreme pretentiousness, and, worst of all, sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>For a few years, I have been thinking that we ought to dismantle large sections of urban and suburban America.  Many cities are cancers on the nation, consuming much and producing little.  The first step, however, is to remove the social carcinogens.  Any program that does not look first to the interests of productive Whites is doomed, as well as immoral.  Unless a plan faces racial realities, it&rsquo;s just more &#8220;urban renewal&#8221;, another effort to make silk purses out of sow&rsquo;s ears.  </p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not coincidental that Detroit, Philly, Memphis, Baltimore, and Flint have large black populations. I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, in the 1980s, which was mostly a terrible economic decade for the city, but in (at that time) the very largely white city, nobody was talking about demolishing what already existed; instead, people strived for economic recovery, and when it came, they added to what had been there before. Which explains why Calgary is a much bigger city now than it was during the last major recession. Tokyo was destroyed during World War II, but the Japanese reconstructed it. What this article does not say is that non-blacks do not want to be around majority black cities, and blacks do not seem to have the ability or motivation to maintain, let alone expand, municipalities.</p>

		<p>Gee, 50 years ago when the population of Flint consisted of 2nd genration eastern european and old American scotch irish from the south, the town was a thriving, wonderful, crime free community with good schools.</p>
<p>Only thing that changed is the population.</p>
<p>Look at my hometown, San Francisco.  80 years ago Fillmore neighborhood was a thriving, wonderful Japanese-Jewish neighborhood.  It had the most beautiful middle class housing stock in the city.  Not quite Pacific Heights standards, but gorgeous pre 1906 earthquake victorians.</p>
<p>Then the Japanese were sent to detention camps during WW2.  Blacks were brought up from the south to work in war industries and the harbor, the most important Pacific port in America at the time.  The blacks drove the Jews out by their usual reign of murder, rape and terrorism.  By 1945 Fillmore was a worse and more crime ridden ghetto than the worst of Oakland.</p>
<p>25 years later, 1970, gay men began to move into Fillmore.  Not having women and children to protect they were able to defend themselves against the feral population.  Slowly they bought houses and retook the area block by block.</p>
<p>Now Fillmore is once more the lovely neighborhood it was 80 years ago.  Why?  Because Whites have replaced the blacks who drove out the Whites during WW2.</p>

<p>This shows a lack of understanding. Trendy, affluent liberals do not and never will live with blacks. They only stand back from a difference, pretend to be better than race-conscious whites, and watch the devestation.</p>

		<p>       The States with large minority populations and bloated debt loads will be put to work on multipliable construction projects in revitalization attempts; pressuring State and Federal government to raise taxes; look for the government to counter by introducing (value added tax) one modeled after similar taxes already in place in Europe. </p>
<p>       A good example of a (value added tax) is tax imposed on a manufacturer when he sells to a wholesaler and again when a wholesaler sells to a retailer and again when the consumer buys. <br>
	<br>
        The big problem will be attracting wealthy whites back to the cities; most affluent whites steer clear of trouble spots and high taxes which most big cities have in abundance.<br>
	<br>
       After all multiculturalism is reserved for the lower classes; politicians and the special interests who promoting massive immigration don&rsquo;t really want move into dangerous cities; they&rsquo;ll continue hiding in gated communities. It&rsquo;s the poor whites who are the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values.<br>

		<p>These people are naive if they think that nature will simply reclaim the city and become a serene meadow. These are urban areas we&rsquo;re talking about, there is no top soil left beneath the pavement just concrete and metal that will rust and decay to match the atmosphere created by the diverse city dwellers.</p>

<p>This is just another gentrification scheme to push low income persons from the center of the city by simply eliminating their housing choices. </p>

<p>That reminds  me of the same situation with the housing projects that were built some 40 years ago to uplift people out of the &#8220;ghetto&#8221;.   They very quickly became known as nests of crime and violence. Obviously, there was something harmful in those buildings!  </p>
<p>More recently, it&rsquo;s been the new thing to tear down those old &#8220;projects&#8221;  that were once thought to represent  enlightenment and progress.   Even the word &#8220;Projects&#8221; was banned by the administration in  NYC, so negative were its overtones. </p>
<p>Well now,  as a logical progression of this mentality,  instead of tearing down projects, we&rsquo;ve graduated to tearing down cities!    It figures.   What next?</p>
<p>But nobody asks why it&rsquo;s necessary. Just what is in that water anyway?</p>

		<p>Strange how things go full-circle.<br>
Two hundred years ago that part of Michigan was a wilderness populated by wild animals and hunter-gathere Indians.<br>
 Pionees arrived, and later small settlements of wooden houses appeared, then the hamlets turned towns with proper roads and brick houses and lastly they turned to cities with all the amenities of civilised life.The point is that all towns and cities are man-made artifacts.<br>
 Of course, in Europe this process is much older - most cities have roots of thousands of years, but Flint, Michigan is the first case I&rsquo;ve ever heard of a city reverting back to wilderness - and only in the blink of an historical eye.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The radical experiment is the brainchild of Dan Kildee, treasurer of Genesee County, which includes Flint.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.  Politicians seldom have ideas, and I&rsquo;m sure this case is no exception.  I first read about this idea in &#8220;The Atlantic&#8221;, around fifteen years ago - I forget who wrote the article - some journalist summarizing the ideas of some professor or policy wonk or another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most are former industrial cities in the &ldquo;rust belt&rdquo; of America&rsquo;s Mid-West and North East. They include Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Memphis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Memphis is now a mid-western &#8220;Rust Belt&#8221; city?  It isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Rust Belt&#8221; cities which now lie in ruins.  It is &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; cities.</p>

		<p>Interesting concept. How about turning these areas into gardens?Shopping at my local supermarker is like being in several foreign countries. The produce section is filled with signs signifying that goods are either from Mexico, Hondorus, Guatamala, etc. How about some fruit and vegetables from the good old USA?

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The city is buying up houses in more affluent areas to offer people in neighbourhoods it wants to demolish. Nobody will be forced to move, said Mr Kildee&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Mike Harrigan, I too was struck by this statement and wondered if it is THE main reason all of this is being done  &mdash;  social engineering to move blacks into &#8216;more affluent&rsquo; neighborhoods and densify cities at the same time.</p>
<p>I think the current socialist administration has a draconian Master Plan to transform the US into European-style cities, mandating that we only drive tiny, ugly &#8216;green&rsquo; cars, mandating how much space each of us can have for housing, rationing water, ram-rodding Section 8 housing into every development, along with rationed health care and control of the economy.</p>

		<p>Ok, so they&rsquo;re bulldozing or planning on bulldozing large sections of our old inner cities.  They&rsquo;re doing this to empty, abandoned buildings, or to those that will soon be empty and abandoned.</p>
<p>So, where have the denizens of the inner cities gone?  Do you think they&rsquo;re going to be standing around in the same old inner city, newly homeless?</p>
<p>Section 8 housing!  They&rsquo;ve been moved out to the suburbs and into apartment complexes that have to admit them and take Section 8 funding.</p>
<p>The crime wave is spreading fast into the suburbs as these become innercitified.</p>
<p>This is all by design, too.  A foreign power that wanted to take down and destroy America couldn&rsquo;t have done any better than this.</p>

I looked at the street my mother lived on as a child  &mdash;  Vermont Street  &mdash;  and thought, wow, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be here in the daytime!  Where my family and I lived on Trumbull when I was a toddler is now an empty lot, since that apartment house had burned down not long after we moved to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Some parts are starting to look like a war zone.</p>
<p>Then, for the fun of it, I took a look at East St. Louis.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to set foot there!</p>
<p>I have learned, over the years, that if you&rsquo;re in a part of town that looks a bit seedy, and has bars on the windows and blacks walking around  &mdash;  best not to stick around.

<p>In LA it&rsquo;s already happening and I&rsquo;ve read estimates that up to 40% of the local economy here is cash-based  &mdash;  meanwhile, entitlement services continue to go through the roof.  Many of the &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; communities have created their own cash-based economies, only dealing with  themselves, of course.</p>
<p>I too have started dealing in cash on any transactions I possibly can  &mdash;  it often gets me a discount and better service.  As the chimney sweep told me when I asked if he accepted cash:  Cash is King! (he knocked $10 off his price too).</p>

		<p>While the idea of replacing urban blight with forests and meadows sounds good, my prediction is that the same people who have destroyed these cities as livable places and driven out their former white occupants will simply fill the meadows with trash and stolen or burned-out vehicles.</p>

<p>The above is a great example of how a gloss over of history leads to complete misunderstandings and failure.  The French Revolution only replaced a benign well intentioned king who went broke financing the American Revolution with a horrid, bloody, revolution that produced Napoleon.

		<p>What kills me is that, even in the ruin and decay, the architectures of these buildings are beautiful!  And it makes me angry at our own race for not fighting, tooth and nail, to hold onto it!  Trying to flee the blacks threw them out of architectural beauty into soulless, dreary little tract homes out in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I agree with the politician who feels it is better to demolish these ruins and let the area go back to the wilderness.  But he is making one big mistake.</p>
<p>If I were he, I wouldn&rsquo;t move people from bad neighborhoods into more affluent ones unless I wanted the blight to spread.  He needs to understand that it&rsquo;s the people that are the problem, not the lack of money.  If they couldn&rsquo;t take pride in and maintain their current neighborhood, but let it go to hell in a handbasket, they are only going to ruin other neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I would simply bulldoze and clear the unoccupied homes and leave the stragglers where they are. And if the population is too sparse, I&rsquo;d tell them they are no longer entitled to city services and they are on their own.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get even more draconian than that.  For the folks who are still numerous enough to get city services, I&rsquo;d demand that any adult on welfare get sterilized or lose all benefits and then I&rsquo;d put a limit on how long the able-bodied could get benefits.  The shrinking taxbase would be my perfect built-in excuse.</p>
<p>I guarantee these people would &#8220;self-deport&#8221; to areas where sillier heads, softer hearts, and plumper pockets prevail and they&rsquo;d no longer be a problem.  Eliminate the problem and people who build businesses and pay their taxes would return.<br>
