<h1>Arpaio: Racially Motivated Assaults Prompt Jail Lockdowns</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Turner, KNXV-TV (Phoenix), June 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio has ordered all Maricopa County jails to immediately be placed on lockdown after learning that inmates were planning racially motivated, large scale assaults, according to the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office on Monday.</p>
<p>The jails hold approximately 10,000 inmates, 44-percent are Hispanic, 37-percent are white, and 14-percent are black, MCSO said.</p>
<p>Over half of the Hispanic inmates are reportedly undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s SWAT units will be standing by ready to assist in case a disturbance breaks out at the jails, MCSO said.</p>
<p>Visitation, inmate phone calls, and all non-essential movement will be restricted until the Sheriff lifts the lockdown, MCSO said.</p>
<p>Inmates will only be able to leave their cells for court appearances, MCSO said.  Approximately 800 inmates are transported each day for court appearances.</p>

		<p>     The Democrats probably started this to give Arpaio a black eye. These people have no morals. They are the equivalent to the Gestapo and the N.K.V.D. Their viciousness in quest of absolute power knows no bounds. The American people will probably sit back, watch the propaganda that passes for news today, and say,&#8221;Ho-hum.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the 44% hispanic isn&rsquo;t shocking, that blacks account for only 14% is surprising. Does anyone have the demographics of this county? Are blacks a small percentage?</p>

<p>While I am sure that &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; for the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; of the affirmatively pigmented will hoot and squeak like baboons with ruptured hemorrhoids, Sheriff Arpaio has clearly done the right thing here. Jails, unlike prisons, are largely transitory institutions and the inmates in them tend to be highly volatile; as one might expect, having yourself cutoff from the daily dosages of crack and turpentine is enough to cause anyone to get boisterous. Thus, some measures must be taken to avoid the more feral behaviors left unchecked, that regularly transpire in the streets or gutters; if not lockdowns, then it is going to be the teargas and truncheons.</p>
<p>That may seem somewhat &ldquo;harsh,&rdquo; but unless you have experienced working in just such a human zoo, you cannot even imagine half of the gregarious &ldquo;shenanigans&rdquo; that can occur in them!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sheriff&rsquo;s intelligence officials received information showing the reason behind the planned assault is inmate&rsquo;s dislike for bunking with other inmates of different racial backgrounds, MCSO said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know more about this, but if I had to guess I would say that this involves mostly blacks and mestizos.  Their dislike for one another is legendary, and they&rsquo;re having lockdowns constantly in the jails, prisons and schools in California.  It&rsquo;s been going on now for quite a few years, but has gotten far worse in the last ten years.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, there were a couple of articles on this site describing how the LA County Sheriff freely admitted blacks and Hispanics were in a race war in Southern California.</p>
<p>It looks like it is now spreading to Arizona.  I&rsquo;m just wondering if Texas and Nevada are having the same problems, but go unreported by the PC press who believe they&rsquo;re doing their diversity god&rsquo;s work by keeping a lid on things until their rainbow utopia finally emerges at last.</p>
<p>New Mexico just might escape the same problems, because I believe their black population is minimal, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

		<p>Maricopa County contains Phoenix. According to the census its 4.7% Black, and roughly 30% Hispanic and 60% white. I&rsquo;m sure if you accounted for &#8220;undocumented&#8221; illegals the Hispanic numbers are higher. But of course Blacks in Phoenix like their brethren elsewhere commit crime at much higher rates than any other group.</p>

		<p>sbuffalonative: The population stats are as follows<br>
White:61.5%<br>
Black: 4.3%<br>
Asian: 2.7%<br>
Native American: 2.2%<br>
Hispanics: 30.1%</p>
<p>so yes, there is quite a disproportionate rate of crime there too.</p>

		<p>To sbuffalonative, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the 44% hispanic isn&rsquo;t shocking, that blacks account for only 14% is surprising. Does anyone have the demographics of this county? Are blacks a small percentage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the population by race for Maricopa County, Arizona:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As of the census[8] of 2000, there were 3,072,149 people, 1,132,886 households, and 763,565 families residing in the county. The population density was 334 people per square mile (129/km²). There were 1,250,231 housing units at an average density of 136/sq mi (52/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 77.35% White, 3.73% African American, 1.85% Native American, 2.16% Asian, 0.14% Pacific Islander, 11.86% from other races, and 2.91% from two or more races. 29.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 19.10% reported speaking Spanish at home.[9]&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, only 4.7%. Hispanics are 30.5%, but this is skewed by the fact that they&rsquo;re a young demographic and an unusually large percentage are under the age of 18. If you look only at the over 18 population (which we should be doing since almost all juvenile inmates are held in facilities other than the county jail) then the percentage is probably considerably smaller. </p>

		<p>Simon Jester:</p>
<p>Maricopa County (Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, Scottsdale) only has a very small percentage of blacks.  Last I looked, it was only like 3%, mainly ghettoized in neighborhoods west of the Black Canyon Freeway (I-17) and north of the Papago Freeway (I-10), extending west for a few miles and north for about six or seven.</p>
<p>What it lacks in blacks, it far more than makes up for with Hispanics.</p>
<p>Tucson actually has a higher black percentage, what it is I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But it is not surprising to any of us that 3% of the population is 14% of Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s tents.</p>

		<p>The inmates KNEW or know the Al (Sharpton) was coming to bother the sheriff so they were getting ready for the show. I was at the prison camp in Iraq (Camp Bucca) for 19 months. At the time there were about 4000 inmates and the inmates KNEW when the bleeding heart Swiss, Belgian and FRENCH red cross was coming because they would burn all of their clothes, beds and tents (living in tents before the new bldgs) but AFTER they removed the big Philips plasma TV and DVD players.</p>

		<p>Recent article states:</p>
<p>because of rumors of trouble between black and Hispanic inmates. &hellip;. He said Monday inmates were apparently upset at not being grouped by race or ethnic background, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we segregate them, they don&rsquo;t like each other, that means I&rsquo;m giving into them by isolating groups based on the ethnic background,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not going to happen.&#8221;</p>
