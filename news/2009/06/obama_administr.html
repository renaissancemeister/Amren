<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/06/22/obama_administration_continues.html?wprss=44">Obama Administration Continues Path Toward Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About half of the top decision makers in the Obama administration are white men, according to a survey conducted by National Journal magazine. That figure is slightly lower than it was when President Bush was in office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-two percent of the top Obama officials are white males, compared with 59 percent at the start of the Bush administration and 60 percent at the start of Bush&rsquo;s second term,&#8221; the magazine reports.</p>
<p>Similar shifts in the direction of increased diversity have taken place among other demographic groups. &#8220;Women account for 34 percent of Obama&rsquo;s top officials, compared with 26 percent at the start of Bush&rsquo;s first term,&#8221; the Journal notes. &#8220;Racial minorities account for 25 percent of Obama&rsquo;s top officials, compared with 20 percent at the beginning of the Bush administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magazine gathered the information for the 366 top officials in the White House and federal agencies during a series of interviews for biographical sketches.</p>

		<p>Lol.  Now let&rsquo;s see the breakdown by religion and ethnicity.  That 52 percent would quickly evaporate.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to see a far larger non-white presence at the highest levels.  Why should whites predominate there?  These hypocrites, who ostensibly push the hardest for &#8220;diversity,&#8221; should lead by example and step aside so the demographics can be entirely non-white at the elite levels of politics.</p>
<p>THEN we&rsquo;ll see some real change.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for a &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;white supremacist,&#8221; position, eh?</p>
<p>We need to hit the elites where it hurts.  I say they&rsquo;re extremely vulnerable to the other edge of the sword they&rsquo;ve been wielding against us for so long.  That&rsquo;s a huge, untapped rhetorical resource just waiting for us to use it.</p>
<p>Basically, the more power and prestige imparted by a position in government, quasi-government, or the media, the more I want to see it occupied by a non-white.  This window-dressing stuff, where we get a black president surrounded by whites, has to go.</p>
<p>When the great and the good are bleeding heavily from the same sword, maybe they&rsquo;ll throw it away.</p>

		<p>52% white!! and they&rsquo;re probably heterosexual too!! When will the racism and homophobia end? We can never move forward as a vibrant diverse multicultural nation until we get that 52% down to 0%</p>

		<p>Is this surprising to anyone who has read Obama&rsquo;s books?<br>
Placing people of color in their rightful place is prime directive for this president. Making the country work well is of little importance. </p>

		<p>Does anyone ask this question: If all potential Supreme Court nominees were RANKED numerically, from 1 to 1000, how many hundreds of white woman and white men were NOT even considered for the Court, simply because of their skin color?</p>
<p>Top appointments should goto the MOST EXPERIENCED and MOST CAPABLE for the good of the nation.<br>
EVERY appointment COULD be filled with JUST white woman or just white men, and be done ENTIRELY ON MERIT.<br>
In fact, without EVER KNOWING THE IDENTITY OF THE APPLICANTS, looking solely at credentials, it would be easy and possible to fill EVERY TOP POSITION with people (and then once the credentials determined who should have been elected) then when the people showed up, ONLY THEN would we realize they would all be white.</p>
<p>How can any self-respecting ambitious person who had no choice over being born white, when given the choice of either supporting their own dispossession or supporting a fair and free competition based soley on merit   &mdash;   not race  &mdash;   of what they want, choose to be dispossessed?</p>

<p>It was my understanding that most of those &#8220;white&#8221; males were actually Jewish.  I thought perhaps it was impolite to mention, but it seems I am not the only one who questions this statistic.  Jewish males, in general, do not represent my interests.</p>

<p>Not so fast, remember the unique first names blacks like to have. I have looked at many resumes and immediately know who is black by names, grammar and hometown and never been wrong. ALSO! SKIP the psychic STILL predicts&hellip;..that as the Obamaster&rsquo;s term moves on more and more White members of his staff will resign &#8220;for personal reasons&#8221; and be replaced with, not other, but by a blacks!!!! and the slide continues.</p>
