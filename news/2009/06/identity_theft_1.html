<h1>Identity Theft, Document Fraud, and Illegal Employment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Center for Immigration Studies, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Contact: Bryan Griffith, (202) 466-8185, press@cis.org</p>
<p>In May of this year, a Supreme Court decision severely impeded the use of identity theft charges as an immigration enforcement tool. In June, several people were arrested after a fraud scheme was uncovered at a Florida driver&rsquo;s license bureau. In July, a new Utah law targeting illegal aliens and document fraud will take effect. As these examples show, illegal immigration is inherently tied to document fraud and identity theft. As states continue to search for answers, it is apparent that the Federal government has not yet found a working legislative solution to deter these crimes.</p>
<p>A new Backgrounder by the Center for Immigration Studies considers how illegal aliens perpetrate document fraud and identity theft, the effects on the victims of this crime, as well as some proposals to deter it. &#8220;Illegal, but Not Undocumented: Identity Theft, Document Fraud and Illegal Employment,&#8221; is written by Ronald Mortensen, PhD, a retired career U.S. Foreign Service Officer and former Society for Human Resource Management senior executive. The Backgrounder is available online at: https://www.cis.org/identitytheft.</p>
<p>The findings include:</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants are not &#8220;undocumented.&#8221; They have fraudulent documents such as counterfeit Social Security cards, forged drivers licenses, fake &#8220;green cards,&#8221; and phony birth certificates. Experts suggest that approximately 75 percent of working-age illegal aliens use fraudulent Social Security cards to obtain employment.</p>
<p>Most (98 percent) Social Security number (SSN) thieves use their own names with stolen numbers. The federal E-Verify program, now mandated in only 14 states, can detect this fraud. Universal, mandatory use of E-Verify would curb this and stop virtually 100 percent of child identity theft.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration and high levels of identity theft go hand-in-hand. States with the most illegal immigration also have high levels of job-related identity theft. In Arizona, 33 percent or all identity theft is job-related (as opposed to identity theft motivated simply by profit). In Texas it is 27 percent; in New Mexico, 23 percent; in Colorado, 22 percent; California, 20 percent; and in Nevada, 16 percent. Eight of the 10 states with the highest percentage of illegal aliens in their total population are among the top 10 states in identity theft (Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, Nevada, New York, Georgia, and Colorado).</p>
<p>Children are prime targets. In Arizona, it is estimated that over one million children are victims of identity theft. In Utah, 1,626 companies were found to be paying wages to the SSNs of children on public assistance under the age of 13. These individuals suffer very real and very serious consequences in their lives.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Illegal aliens commit felonies in order to get jobs. Illegal aliens, who use fraudulent documents, perjure themselves on I-9 forms, and commit identity theft in order to get jobs are committing serious offenses and are not &#8220;law abiding.&#8221;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Illegally employed aliens send billions of dollars annually to their home countries, rather than spending it in the United States and helping stimulate the American economy. In October 2008 alone, $2.4 billion was transferred to Mexico.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Tolerance of corruption erodes the rule of law. Corruption is a serious problem in most illegal aliens&rsquo; home countries. Allowing it to flourish here paves the way for additional criminal activity and increased corruption throughout society.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Leaders support perpetrators and ignore victims. Political, civic, religious, business, education, and media leaders blame Americans for &#8220;forcing&#8221; illegal aliens to commit document fraud and identity theft. No similar concern is expressed for the American men, women, and children whose lives are destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service facilitate illegal immigrant-driven identity theft. Both turn a blind eye to massive SSN fraud and take no action to stop it. The Social Security Administration assigns SSNs to new-born infants that are being used illegally. The IRS demands that victims pay taxes on wages earned by illegal aliens using their stolen SSNs, while taking no action to stop the identity theft.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;State and local governments need to adopt tougher laws to supplement federal efforts. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is targeting large document fraud rings and the most egregious employers, but their resources are limited and stretched across multiple priorities. In 2007, identity theft cases represented only 7 percent of the total ICE case load.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Employers must do their part. They can ensure that they have a legal workforce by using a combination of the federal government&rsquo;s E-Verify and Social Security Number Verification Service systems and by signing up for the federal government&rsquo;s IMAGE program or privately conducted audits.</p>

		<p>THE UNDOCUMENTED SCAM.</p>
<p>The libbarbarians are masters at using scam words that sugarcoats their evil but denigrates our good.</p>
<p>So we must not fall trap to their vocabulary, but use our own.</p>
<p>One of their scam words is &#8220;undocument immigrant&#8221;.  A good response to this scam word is like this.</p>
<p>Why call anybody a&hellip;instead of &hellip;.?</p>
<p>thief  &mdash;  undocumented shoppper<br>
rapist  &mdash;  undocumented husband<br>
burglar  &mdash;  undocumented owner<br>
Drug dealer  &mdash;  undocumented physician/pharmacist<br>
drug abuser  &mdash;  undocumented patient<br>
axe killer  &mdash;  undocumented meat processor<br>
murdered  &mdash;  undocumented death penalty executioner<br>
bank robber  &mdash;  undocumented customer. <br>

		<p>I was just refused a renewal of my drivers license of 12 years, because the DMV said I had to prove my identity all over again, even though I did so when I obtained my license originally.  They said I had to show them a birth certificate, a SS card, a passport or some other I.D. with my photo on it.  Who knows where I.D. like that is mislaid when it&rsquo;s never needed until now?</p>
<p>I went to the passport office and was told my existing license was inadequate for I.D., because it wasn&rsquo;t a guaranteed Real I.D. type.  They said I needed a recent photo I.D. issued by the government.  A debit/credit card with my photo on it was not sufficient.  An active builder&rsquo;s license was of no value to them either they told me.  They said I also needed a birth certificate and a SS card. </p>
<p>Adequate I.D. for a SS card was a passport, (no driver&rsquo;s license or birth certificate would do)a DD 214, military discharge, (A copy wouldnt do. It had to be an original.)  Plus I would need a tax return in support of the DD214.  I also needed a utility bill verifying where I lived or a tax bill with my full name on it.</p>
<p>I thought I would start out by getting a birth certficate. To get one they told me I would need a Real I.D. driver&rsquo;s license or I.D. card, plus a SS card, or a Passport, and a military DD214 could be used as a supporting document.</p>
<p>I contacted everybody trying to get something&hellip;.anything.  I told each agency I contacted that I couldn&rsquo;t provide the information they needed because each one of them required a document I couldn&rsquo;t get unless I had the document I was trying to get from them.  </p>
<p>In short, just as one example, how could I provide a birth certificate to get a license renewal when I needed the new license to get a birth certificate, etc. It was like that for each and every document.</p>
<p>After a LOT of running around; a LOT of phone calls: a LOT of research on the internet; and a LOT of begging and leg work, I finally got enough I.D. to prove who I was to the satisfaction of the DMV.</p>
<p>But it was very difficult.  And completely unnecessary as well.</p>
<p>And when I realize how easy it is for aliens to get a DL, it makes me really bitter indeed.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like what this country has become.  They need adequate I.D. from aliens, because they might be terrorists, so instead of requiring aliens to produce proper documents they require ALL of us to twice prove who we say we are so they can&rsquo;t be considered prejudiced or profiling.</p>
<p>In the event we had another war, there&rsquo;s no way I would EVER enter the military now and fight for this piece of real estate, because it doesn&rsquo;t really belong to anyone but non-whites, radical leftist politicians and corporate greed artists.  I tell my nephews and other kids the same thing, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure they understand the situation better than I did at their age.</p>

		<p><i>Illegal immigrants are not &ldquo;undocumented.&rdquo; They have fraudulent documents&hellip;</i></p>
<p>They also have <i>legitimate</i> documents  &mdash;   in their own countries!  </p>
<p>Yes, legalize the illegals.  With a one-way ticket home.</p>

		<p>My daughter&rsquo;s employer employs lots of Hispanics. Her boss the owner ONLY asks for SSN and Driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>I then informed my daughter about using the E-Verify website and she took it to her boss.</p>
<p>He told my daughter it was not necessary as he &#8220;trusted&#8221; the Feds and State DMV to do &#8220;their&#8221; job. How convenient.</p>
<p>Until the employers are severely fined and imprisoned, the invasion will continue to be enabled and financed by your greedy, traitorous next-door-neighbor.</p>

		<p>If the employer of Thomas Jackson&rsquo;s daughter faced a minimum one-year prison sentence he would certainly ensure that his employees had their documents in order.</p>

		<p>The below story tells us all we need to know about our corrupt government and its inept policies and laws.  An illegal alien, and three others, shot an undercover cop during a sting operation.</p>
<p>Note from the below excerpt that the illegal had TWO Texas drivers&rsquo;s licenses and several I.D. documents.  How much trouble do you have getting just one?</p>
<p>These clowns in Washington and the state legislatures are so out of touch with the real world the assinine laws they pass always bring some kind of hardship to the law abiding population, and the illegals, terrorists and people they&rsquo;re supposed to target, have no problem getting around their obnoxious laws and policies.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6498386.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6498386.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Under HPD policy, officers are not allowed to inquire about citizenship status during routine traffic stops. Suspects without valid identification can be fingerprinted, even for minor offenses. Carrillo, however, had several forms of ID, including at least two Texas driver&rsquo;s licenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>This government is too big to work anymore.  Making grandmothers and grandfathers take off their shoes at airports to be searched is only one of a dozen screw ups they&rsquo;ve perpetrated lately.  The &#8220;stimulus bill&#8221; and the &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; are an absolute insanity and serve only to shift our middle class wealth to blacks and other non-whites.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the way out, folks.  There&rsquo;s no way things will improve enough to continue.  After just a couple of hundred years this country has become defunct operationally and will soon be belly up economically.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t see how anyone could ever think we&rsquo;re going to survive as a nation.</p>
<p>My plans were to relocate to a community of like-minded people in a Western wilderness area in five years, but I don&rsquo;t think we have more than three, maybe 4, left before things are so far out of control it will be dangerous to travel the highways and biways.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be be difficult, but I&rsquo;m making my move in three years, instead of five.  Thankfully, my girlfriend sees things exactly as I do.  And I&rsquo;m thankful also there are no children involved.<br>
