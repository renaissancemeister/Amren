			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward Hayes, Washington Examiner, June 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Educated African immigrants today are doing to angry African-Americans the same thing that genteel southern blacks did to angry black northerners the last thirty years; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quietly moving in and replacing them in the economy. While self-righteous and animated civil rights veterans in Chicago, New York, Detroit, and Los Angeles marched, protested, grew long hair, and elected crooked politicians, less demonstrative and more reasonable black folk from Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia moved into the big cities and sucked up the best jobs. The angry young, gifted and black natives of Harlem, Watts, and Chicago&rsquo;s south side are still languishing in Harlem, Watts, and the wastelands of the south side waiting for Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton to deliver them from evil and distribute slave reparations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wave of black brothers and sisters from the south have moved into homes in the suburbs, freed their children from the horror of the Arne Duncan Public School System, and are graduating from good colleges and universities. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Two years ago, Clarence Page, Chicago Tribune editorial writer, opened the media door to this educational truth when he wrote, &#8216;About 8 percent of Harvard University undergraduates were black. One-half to two-thirds of them were either West Indian or African Immigrants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immigrants make up 13% of the nation&rsquo;s college-age black population, but their representation in Ivy League and elite universities exceeds 25% of the total enrollment of black students, twice their proportion in the general population! Elite schools are admitting black students, in part to accommodate both legal and sociological goals. {snip} Africans do not necessarily require affirmative action to attend college, but surely many benefit from it. Consequently, many black youngsters that have absolutely no connection to American slavery are benefiting from the Martin Luther King phenomena. {snip} </p>

		<p>It has been my experience that carribean Blacks an African Blacks are much more academically gifted than many American Blacks. You will find more of them in Honors programs, Ph.D. programs etc&hellip; </p>
<p>I think that they take education more seriously than American Blacks</p>

<p>anyone familiar with higher ed in the US has known for decades that AA benefits wealthy african americans &amp; affluent Caribbean and African blacks - it is a perennial topic of discusion at harvard, for example. </p>
<p>whites from poor backgrounds who make it into the ivy league solely on academic merit (like me, for ex.) are surrounded by lowscoring blacks from families incomparably more privileged than mine. </p>

		<p>It is also NOT a coincidence that the first black president is not a descendent of slaves either (Ironically, he is a descendent of a slaveowner). The slave trade brought the lowest IQ African population en masse. African immigrants are elite by comparison. </p>

		<p>Bwahaahaa.. more Victicrat rant. Tell ya what.. next time you meet one of these black affirmative action success stories, look past the Armani suit, the Rolex, the Guccis, the BMW..and actually listen to what these &#8220;elite&#8221; blacks sound like and talk about.  Its the same ignorance, and crudity as always. Food, Sex, Sports&hellip;see of course VictiCrat politics. See if you can get one elite black anywhere to talk about anything of substance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Most beneficiaries of affirmative action are not African Slaves&#8221;</p>
<p>That is not the point that leftists care about, and it never has been the point that leftists care about. They are all about illusion. They only care what the outward impression is, since they never really get involved, for the most part, in the lives of the people they choose to empower. All of their actions that often have negative consequences, whether it&rsquo;s forced busing, affirmative aciton,etc. are left for others to clean up  &mdash;  and then those others are often accused of racism.   </p>

<p>The only way most of them get into college is via affirmative action.  That encompasses entry, grades and certification.  Without AA, there would be VERY few blacks at any institution of higher education, unless it was one that was all black with low admission standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still chuckling after a good laugh when I got to where he&rsquo;s saying AA is in place because of slavery.</p>
<p>Slavery has absolutely nothing to do with black lack of intellect, and it&rsquo;s oh, so funny to hear them keep whining that slavery is the reason they&rsquo;re behind the rest of the people in this country.</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>

		<p>Does it really matter whether these Blacks are West Indian or African immigrants, or Americna born Blacks. The outcome will remain the same. They will get their Ivy league degree, but once they get out in the work force, they most likely will be incompetent or mediocre in their abilities. </p>

This issue has been around for years.</p>
<p>The problem is blacks can&rsquo;t think an issue through to it&rsquo;s multiple outcomes. They push diversity to show their alleged inclusiveness but it backfires and they&rsquo;re again left out.</p>
<p>Blacks still haven&rsquo;t figured out what latinos are doing with diversity either. Hispanics have been using blacks as a stepping stone and reaping the diversity benefits blacks wanted for themselves. And blacks keep demanding more diversity.</p>
<p>Blacks will always be at the bottom even when they get what they say they want.</p>

		<p>Needless to say Hispanics were never slaves in the United States.  Yet they too get affirmative action preferences over whites, including the children of people here illegally.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to one university (Berkeley) and four community colleges and what they all have in common is that the majority of blacks were immigrants.  Meanwhile the American ones just sit around and wait out the impossible dream..reparations which would only amount to civil war.  On another site I read an American black whining (as usual) that the Africans will be signing their paychecks.  The biggest enemy to black America is black America.</p>

		<p>&#8220;affirmative action&#8221; is a stupid illegal unconstitutional set of actions that were snuck in while we were led to believe that it was just like &#8220;community outreach&#8221; - going out to descendants of slaves and encouraging them to apply for jobs.<br>
It turned out to be what the authors intended - a set of special privileges given to people solely on the basis of their skin shade and/or facial characteristics.<br>

		<p>The fundamental principle behind affirmative action is to punish whites.  </p>
<p>There is no coherent, rational basis, or benevolent, charitable sentiment involved.  It comes from pure hate of the white race.</p>

		<p>I doubt that Carribean or African blacks are - on average - any smarter or harder working than American blacks.  Instead, it is a case of self-selection   &mdash;   only the smartest and hardest working immigrate to the US.  It&rsquo;s the same way with Indians.  Many people think they&rsquo;re all computer whizzes, but in reality there are over a billion people in India and we only interact with the top 1%.  </p>

		<p>The reason for &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; is NOT making up for past slavery (this has been accomplished quite a long time ago) but displacement of paleo-Americans with &#8220;under-represented&#8221; minorities regardless of their slave descendant status.<br>

		<p>americas number one problem is that all of the blacks and white liberals and politicians are so consumed by the slavery issue, that it has stymied our nation. they&rsquo;re still arguing the politics of 1840, instead of the politics of 2009. they are obsessed with it. we will never progress until it is put into law that this topic cannot be discussed any longer.</p>
