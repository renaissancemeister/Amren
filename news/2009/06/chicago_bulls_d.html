<h1>Chicago Bulls&rsquo; Derrick Rose Responds to Photo Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan McGrath and David Heinzmann, Chicago Tribune, June 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After a standout debut season in which he was voted NBA Rookie of the Year, Derrick Rose&rsquo;s off-season encountered more turbulence Thursday.</p>
<p>Weeks after he was linked to allegations of academic fraud at the University of Memphis, the Bulls&rsquo; star guard issued a statement declaring his vehement opposition to gangs in response to a photo posted on the Internet that showed him flashing gang signs at a party in Memphis during his freshman year there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to emphatically state, now and forever, that Derrick Rose is anti-gang, anti-drug and anti-violence,&#8221; Rose said in the statement released through the Bulls. &#8220;I am not, nor have I ever been, affiliated with any gang, and I can&rsquo;t speak loudly enough against gang violence and the things that gangs represent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, a Bulls spokesman said the team was aware of the photo but was not concerned, as gang affiliation and behavior didn&rsquo;t square with the Rose the Bulls know.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rose grew up in Chicago&rsquo;s violent and gang-ridden Englewood neighborhood. The undated photo shows him seated and displaying the &#8220;pitchforks&#8221; sign of the Gangster Disciples Nation. A young man identified as Memphis teammate Antonio Anderson is standing behind Rose, smiling and flashing different gang signs, according to a police source.</p>
<p>&#8220;This photo was taken at a party I attended in Memphis while I was in school there, and was meant as a joke .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a bad one, I now admit,&#8221; Rose&rsquo;s statement said. &#8220;In posing for this picture, I am guilty of being young, naive and of using extremely poor judgment. I sincerely apologize to all my fans for my mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gangster Disciples, a large criminal organization with tens of thousands of members, are deeply involved in Chicago&rsquo;s violent narcotics trade. Gangster Disciples long have been the predominant gang in the Englewood neighborhood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident comes on the heels of another off-court controversy surrounding Rose. The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal broke a story last month stating the NCAA alleged a stand-in took an SAT test for a student who played for Memphis during the 2007-08 season. Several media outlets reported that player to be Rose.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several media outlets subsequently reported that Rose had a grade changed from a D to a C during his senior season at Simeon to help ensure his college eligibility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Irv Rein, a Northwestern communication studies professor whose book, &#8220;The Elusive Fan,&#8221; examines fan cultivation and retention, believes Rose is &#8220;next in line&#8221; behind LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade as a marketing star.</p>
<p>&#8220;Short-term, there might be some effect, but long-term I don&rsquo;t think so,&#8221; Rein said. &#8220;He has a good American story  &mdash;  up from the ghetto. He has a nice smile. And he&rsquo;s a hell of a player.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I believe there was a similar incident last year involving Paul Pierce flashing a gang sign during a game.  To be sure, even if these players aren&rsquo;t affiliated with gang activity (which I believe they are), they certainly relish the opportunity to present themselves as thugs.  In no other race do you find such a widespread and irrational desire to promote oneself as something so contrary to civilized society.  </p>

		<p>It might not literally be a gang sign, because the people to whom he is sending message are probably not real gang bangers.  Are we to think that the GDs have a national headquarters and print membership cards and keep lists of members?  There are a lot of gray areas when it comes to blacks and gang activity, and I think Rose is in the gray area.</p>

<p>And blacks blame the media for perpetuating stereotypes. The media doesn&rsquo;t have to. All they have to do is show blacks as they represent themselves.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be insensitive but what strikes one when seeing Rose is his plug ugliness.  I can hear the child asking, &ldquo;Mommy why is the king naked, and why is that man so ugly?&rdquo; This must be why modern art is purposely ugly.  It is a conspiracy to get us normal people to think we don&rsquo;t know beauty from ugliness. </p>
<p>Next they hope we won&rsquo;t know black from white.  It is all relative there is no absolute good / evil, beauty / ugliness, or white / black.</p>
<p>Today TV commercials are filled with unattractive white people.   For those of you too young to remember, TV and movies of old were filled with attractive white men and women.  If you place a normally attractive white person side by side with a normally attractive black person the difference is so stark it is obvious to all.  So the Madison Avenue and Hollywood people place dumpy and nerdy whites next to normal blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p>As for gang signs, aren&rsquo;t black millionaires big on buying drugs, and aren&rsquo;t gangs the place to get them?</p>

<p>I see foolish young whites aping these foul gang signs all the time online on the various picture hosting sites. Why whites find these imbecilic gestures to be so adorable (at least for pictures) I have no idea.  On the other hand, if Mr. Rose really found gangs to be so abhorrent, would he think it cute to adopt such a pose? Also, note the tattoos.</p>

<p>This of course is the tragic and depressing flipside to an already depressing matter, as white people across the country, continue to waste precious time and millions of dollars each year viewing the various sports sideshows. </p>

		<p>Maybe, just maybe, this not unintelligent African-American, realizing that he had great potential in basketball, and that criminal activity would put him in jail not in college, did not join a local Afrogang. This behavior is quite possible. As to the rest: his being anti-gang, anti-drug and anti-violence. This attitude in a young healthy Black male would be very unusual. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the dilemma of gang signs   &mdash;   to &#8220;put up&#8221; or &#8220;throw up&#8221; your &#8220;set&#8221; (make the gang hand gesture) you must be a member. Most gangs are notorious for exacting retribution on a non-member doing this and an &#8220;Inner city youth&#8221; like Rose knows this. In fact if he grew up in the ghetto it was imperitive to his safety to know these rules, ergo - to flash the sign is prima facia eveidence of member ship for someone of his backround and experience.</p>

		<p>Last night on the Tonight Show, Kobe Bryant of the L.A. Lakers was the first guest, and the mostly white crowd gave him a big ovation. Did they forget, that a few years ago, he was charged with raping a young white woman in Colorado.(He was there with his black posse.)</p>
<p>I believe that whites in this country tend to be there own worst enemy. </p>
