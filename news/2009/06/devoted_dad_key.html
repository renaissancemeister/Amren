<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31086977/">Devoted Dad Key to Reducing Risky Teen Sex</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Carroll, MSNBC, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When it comes to preventing risky teen sex, there may be no better deterrent than a doting dad.</p>
<p>Teenagers whose fathers are more involved in their lives are less likely to engage in risky sexual activities such as unprotected intercourse, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The more attentive the dad  &mdash;  and the more he knows about his teenage child&rsquo;s friends  &mdash;  the bigger the impact on the teen&rsquo;s sexual behavior, the researchers found. While an involved mother can also help stave off a teen&rsquo;s sexual activity, dads have twice the influence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Understanding a father&rsquo;s influence in teen sexual behavior is important, experts say. One in four American adolescents under the age of 15 has had sexual intercourse and, by age 18, two-thirds have had sex, according to research. The concern is, many sexually active young people aren&rsquo;t using protection, a contributing factor in rising teen birth rates. Approximately 750,000 teenagers become pregnant each year and about 3 in 10 teenage girls become pregnant at least once before age 20, according to government statistics.</p>
<p>For the new study, which was published in the journal Child Development, Coley [Rebekah Levine Coley, an associate professor at Boston College] and her colleagues surveyed 3,206 teens, ages 13 to 18, once a year for four years. The teens, who all came from two-parent homes, were asked about their sexual behaviors and about their relationships with their parents.</p>
<p>Researchers posed a series of questions about both mothers and fathers, such as &#8220;how much does s/he know about whom you are with when you are not at home?&#8221; The teens were also asked how often they interacted with their parents in activities such as eating dinner, playing games or attending religious activities.</p>
<p><b>Dad&rsquo;s positive effect</b></p>
<p>Parental knowledge of a teen&rsquo;s friends and activities was rated on a five point scale. When it came to the dads, each point higher in parental knowledge translated into a 7 percent lower rate of sexual activity in the teen. For the moms, one point higher in knowledge translated to a 3 percent lower rate of teen sexual activity.</p>
<p>The impact of family time overall was even more striking. One additional family activity per week predicted a 9 percent drop in sexual activity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study underscores the importance of parental engagement overall, said Patrick Tolan, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Institute for Juvenile Research at the University of Illinois in Chicago.</p>

		<p>A positive, masculine, male father figure/influence in the life of a child is inestimable&hellip;</p>
<p>Wish to lower the crime rate?  Have an involved dad.<br>
Wish to lower teen pregnancy/sexual  &mdash;  -(even alternative) experimentation?  Have an involved dad.<br>
Wish to lessen the likelihood of truancy/gang involvemennt?  A loving dad around doesn&rsquo;t hurt.<br>
Want to pass on your religious practices  &mdash;  -especially to the sons?  You cannot overestimate the influence of the father.</p>
<p>No disrespect to the mom&rsquo;s out there; they are a loving people, but there&rsquo;s only so much one can do.  Girls look to the fathers for the men they will eventually marry (if they do, nowadays); boys don&rsquo;t learn how to be men by forever being around Mom while Dad is withdrawn, unknown, or disinterested.</p>
<p>I think the knowledge of these things was a given in a by-gone era, not too long ago. Even the left-leaning media, like a stopped watch, happens upon the reality of the natural order every once in a while.</p>

		<p>Let me suggest a non-&#8220;doting dad&#8221; reason. A woman in her thirties or forties, the typical age for the mother of an adolescent, does not have the physical capacity to control an adolescent daughter much less a son. If the mother tells her teen daughter not to go out, and the daughter says, &#8220;Try and stop me&#8221;, without a father to stop her, she goes out. With a biological father present, she stays home. </p>
<p>I have observed this situation many times. As a rule, without a biological father present, daughters do more or less what they want, after they reach the age of 12. </p>
<p>In the case of sons, the situation is a bit more complicated.  Mothers must develop non-physical methods of control. One effective technique is to threaten the son with being forced to live with the father. Another is to send him to Military school. </p>

		<p>Quite an interesting cycle we have here.  No dad around means you&rsquo;re more likely to have a child out of wedlock whose father isn&rsquo;t around, rinse and repeat.</p>

		<p>My father did not care while I was growing up.  He just didn&rsquo;t.  We see each other now, but it is as if we are polite strangers.  I have told him that he can&rsquo;t ever make up for the past at this late point.  The one thing that he did do right was to give me to my mother&rsquo;s family after my mother was killed.  A child can turn out okay without a father if the mother has a really supportive family but not if the mother is alone other than for some social worker who has a ton of other cases to worry about.  </p>
<p>Personality is largely genetic.  The qualities that make a man care about his wife and children are largely genetic too naturally.  I think my grandfather had what it took.  My father didn&rsquo;t.  Dad would have been really good for my brother and I if he had been our uncle.    </p>

		<p>As the father of two daughters (and one son), fathers are the girl&rsquo;s first &#8220;boy-friend&#8221; (in a social sense) and hopefully a good role model is then there to guide them as I did, riding horses with them, taking them out to dinner in restaurants and so on, including welcomed advice about boys and what they really want, after all, I was the same as a horny teenager.  </p>
<p>Both now in their forties and long since happily married, with my grandchildren (one is 18 yrs. old), I guess I did a fairly good job along with my first wife, their mother who left me after 25 years of marriage. Now I have been married ti wife No 2 some 25 years.<br>
 Two parents, a reliable intelligent man and a loving woman are essential ingredients in our society for a normal well-balanced and sane population.   That is why history has developed that way.</p>

		<p>Women hold the reins when it comes to love and relationships in every society. It is women who choose whether society will have marriage or not. </p>
<p>Right now, too many women prefer the easy life of working for themselves and using public services to dealing with a man. Behind every deadbeat dad is a woman who didn&rsquo;t make the effort to be feminine and alluring, didn&rsquo;t make the effort to make a welcoming nurturing home, didn&rsquo;t make the effort to keep the relationship going, and basically didn&rsquo;t want to put up with male behavior one-on-one. </p>
<p>How many women complain about how they &#8220;can&rsquo;t find a decent guy,&#8221; and yet these same women can&rsquo;t cook, don&rsquo;t go to church, don&rsquo;t lift a finger for anyone but themselves&hellip; and can&rsquo;t connect those dots? </p>

		<p>If I could add a politically incorrect appendage to the study&rsquo;s truths, I believe a huge percentage of white girls who have sexual relations and illegitimate children with black males come from households without white fathers.  Face it, few white fathers want their daughters to consort with black males.</p>

		<p>Does the government count as a &#8220;Devoted Dad?&#8221;<br>
This surely flies in the face of the feminists who want to &#8220;liberate&#8221; women and children from their fathers.</p>

<p>Blacks in Africa do not have a monogamous nuclear family and never will. The patterns woven into the genes are expressed as a tribal structure. This does not mean there can&rsquo;t be individual exceptions, but as expressed in large groups, blacks simply devolve to the same pattern you see in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda or any other Sub-Saharan African &#8220;Nation&#8221;. Tribal family structure.</p>
<p>Whites are different. Mycenaean Sarcophagi with a single male/single female couple greeting guests, Homer&rsquo;s Iliad and Odyssey speaking to the sanctity of the single man/single woman structure, the Christian marriage of the same pattern, all speak to 3500 years at least of Europeans adopting to the very bone a single man/single woman family structure.</p>
<p>Sad, but the truth nonetheless. </p>

		<p>All this might be true, but does it mean the converse is true?  Are we to assume that if all these black men who have children go home to their children and the mothers of their children, that everything will be AOK?  First off, some black men have so many children by so many women that they couldn&rsquo;t tell which woman to go home to. </p>
<p>Second, the kinds of black men who would procreate so insouciantly probably would make their children worse, not better.</p>

		<p>I taught my daughter that the &#8220;say no system&#8221; is magic.No good young man that truly loves her would leave her if he had to wait until marriage&hellip;.but the bad ones will leave, hence, the perfect system. I know, because i was a young man once and I would have never left a girl I truly loved over a &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>
