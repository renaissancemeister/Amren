<h1>Somali Teen From Minnesota Reportedly Killed in Homeland</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, June 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Somali teen who left Minnesota to return to his native country last November has been reported killed.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old, who was not named, was reportedly killed Friday in artillery fire in the violence-ravaged nation&rsquo;s capital of Mogadishu, said the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teen was among a group of young Somali-American men who left Minneapolis last year and were feared recruited by the extremist group, al-Shabaab, that has ties to al Qaeda, according to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008.</p>
<p>In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota, traveled to Somalia and blew himself up and 29 others.</p>
<p>The incident, the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen, raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by &#8220;a number of factors that come together when a dynamic, influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men,&#8221; Andrew Liepman, deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center, said earlier this year.</p>
<p>Many refugees, he said, &#8220;lack structure and definition in their lives&#8221; and are &#8220;torn between their parents&rsquo; traditional tribal and clan identities, and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I keep hearing that we need to import Muslims because it exposes them to a better environment (eerily similar to the deseg reasoning), so that they will be less given to terrorism.  Usually it works out the other way around, this Somali being one of many examples.</p>
<p>The only theory I can come up with is that back on Somalia, they&rsquo;re jealous at whites and resentful of white prosperity, but they can only be in the abstract.  When they come here, they see the white prosperity first hand, and get to experience some of it.  But this only serves to contrast with the poverty they came from, and at the same time their feeble minds are not cleansed of paranoia, they still tend to think that it&rsquo;s all some grand conspiracy.  This only makes them more mad.  That is why many go back to Somalia to join the Jihad.</p>

<p>One down, 192,796 to go. And it took the suicide bombing to &#8220;raise intel flags&#8221;?? those of us that know muslims have our red flags up at the mention of muslims.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s release them from this dilemma by just leaving them in Somalia where they belong. </p>

<p>Whoever was responsible for bringing in these jihadists to our country should be tried, convicted and hanged in public.</p>
<p>Just having blacks here causes enough crime and violence.  Bringing in ones who are jihadists is a crime of great propropotions.</p>
<p>This country is finished, and the final analysis is one the radical multis will not want to see, because it will bring an end to fractious societies forever.</p>
<p>Never again!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s one less of my new &#8220;neighbors&#8221; my tax dollars will be wasted on.<br/>
I wish all the rest of them here in Mpls. would head back to Somalia. As far as I can tell, they have added nothing of value to my neighborhood. Quite the opposite actually!</p>

		<p>Somalis are not going to soften their hard African habits just because they live in the West.  </p>
<p>In Ottawa, Canada, there are thousands of Somalis born and raised in Canada.   Their aggressive street-gang activities, endangering the host country, are growing as their numbers rise. </p>

		<p>Somalis don&rsquo;t belong in western countries. They&rsquo;d do much better to return to Somalia. I&rsquo;d gladly pay increased taxes to settle the situation in Somalia if all the Somalis would go back home. It&rsquo;d make things so much better for the United States, Canada, Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Australia&hellip; need I go on?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s now the United States&rsquo; fault if a Somali is killed all the way over in Somalia?</p>
<p>The <i>only</i> mistake the United States made was giving this terrorist citizenship.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Was &ldquo;disenfranchised&rdquo; in US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disenfranchised means deprived of the right to vote.  Being 17 years old he was not of the age to vote.  Therefore he had no right to vote in the first place and thus was never drprived of the right to vote.</p>
<p>Just another example of the morons who have swarmed into journalism.  I bet the writer who doesn&rsquo;t know what the word disenfranchised means and is too lazy to look it up has a Master&rsquo;s in journalism.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you see? It IS our fault! (and by our, I mean White Americans) We failed this young man. We didn&rsquo;t reach out to him and embrace him and learn about his culture. I demand we remove the governor of Minnesota and replace him with a Somali. I demand we set up a council (at the White taxpayer&rsquo;s expense, but I know you won&rsquo;t mind chiping in) of Somali imams to investigate what we White devils can do to make Somalis feel more welcomed in our multiculture paradise. I think we should all send this poor young man&rsquo;s family some money so they can buy a new car and a plasma TV. How else will they ever get over the pain?</p>

		<p>Watching Somalis parade around Minnesota in their desert garb makes me laugh. They say it&rsquo;s traditional. Yes, but the tradition developed in the desert and has no application here.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll have to &#8216;fess up here.  I was the one who &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; this guy.  It&rsquo;s all my fault, and you know what?  I&rsquo;m going to do it again.  I can&rsquo;t help it; as a white male, oppressing Fourth-World folks is just part of my nature.  The racism rays that shoot out of my head at night help me sleep better.</p>
