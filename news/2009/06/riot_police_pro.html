			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Allen, Daily Mail (London), June 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Riot police massed around the entrance of the Channel Tunnel today following threats by protesters to storm it along with UK-bound illegal migrants.</p>
<p>Squadrons of elite officers joined gendarmes in the show of strength near Calais.</p>
<p>It followed the arrival of hundreds of anarchists in the port who have set up a camp aimed at helping migrants &#8216;tear down the borders&rsquo; to England.</p>
<p>More than 800 police are in the town, with another 1,200 on standby nearby.</p>
<p>An uneasy stand-off soon developed with the protesters as a &#8216;spotter&rsquo; helicopter circled the area and police patrols swamped the town.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is a serious risk of public disorder and for this reason we have officers everywhere,&rsquo; said a police spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8216;The entrance to the Channel Tunnel is a particularly vulnerable target and so we have increased out presence around it.</p>
<p>&#8216;If any unauthorised person makes any attempt to get near it, then they will be arrested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the camp itself, protesters began to arrive from all over Europe, including many from Britain.</p>
<p>All are from a group calling itself &#8216;No Borders&rsquo;, which has pledged to &#8216;tear down the borders&rsquo; stopping migrants getting across the Channel.</p>
<p>As their tents and marquees were pitched, some of the 2000 odd migrants sleeping rough in the Calais area began to join them.</p>
<p>One, who said he was an Afghan called Ahmed, said: &#8216;The camp organisers have offered us food and drink, as well as a chance to get to England.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are here to support us. The French authorities repress us, but we have friends who believe our cause is a just one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Local authorities in Calais have gained an official order preventing anyone buying or possessing anything which might be used as a weapon  &mdash;  including substances which can start fires or be used to make Molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>They said they had received email threats by protestors pledging to destroy wire fences and other security measures around the Channel Tunnel .</p>
<p>There have also been threats to burn &#8216;symbols of capitalism&rsquo; including local government offices, and even hotels run by prominent global chains.</p>
<p>Local prefect Pierre de Bosquet confirmed that 2,000 officers were &#8216;in the vicinity&rsquo; of the town, along with a squadron of mounted officers.</p>
<p>Mr De Bosquet said police intelligence had revealed plans for wide scale violence.</p>
<p>Last month Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, said the UK&rsquo;s lax asylum system and benefits culture had &#8216;imposed&rsquo; thousands of illegal migrants on her town.</p>
<p>In a blistering attack in which she also called for millions in compensation, Mrs Bouchart said the UK was entirely to blame for the those who use the port as a staging point.</p>
<p>Mrs Bouchart, a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s ruling UMP Party, even called for border controls to be lifted to allow all migrants to flood across the Channel at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Such views are heartily supported by the militants organising the &#8216;No Border&rsquo; demonstrations, which are set to run until Saturday, when their main demonstration will take place.<br>

		<p>I hope those &#8220;migrants&#8221; destroy everything in sight. As in this country, Europe has VERY few leaders with any backbone, and we both suffer from a LARGE percentage of STUPID, GULLIBLE, GUILT-RIDDEN, GUT-LESS White people. That picture [or. article] of those two Whites holding up the sign saying &#8216;no border&rsquo; is a perfect example of what I&#8221;m taking about. In a sane world, those two idiots would be thrown on the boat along with their &#8216;brown brothers&rsquo; from Africa and the Middle East and sent to live out their lives in those hell holes, never allowed to come back. Just how long do you think they would last there? It&rsquo;s because of idiots like them that we&rsquo;re in this mess to start with, THEY are the enemy. Every time I see an Obama sticker on a White persons car, I just have to look over and look in their face, to see what THEY look like. <br>

		<p>Sit back and enjoy yourselves.  We&rsquo;re watching nations of the West make one horrendous, self-defeating decision after another, and it is UNEQUIVOCALLY going to cause internal war.  It&rsquo;s a rare opportunity to watch nations self destruct right before our eyes, as the self-appointed elites make one crazy decision after another.</p>

You&rsquo;re right TomS, it&rsquo;s the crazy, white liberal (CWL) who will be the death of us. The CWL is always on the side of the anti-whites. There is no equivalent in any other race. We see the incredible sight all over the world, of non-whites migrating TOWARDS the white world, all the while complaining about oppression! It&rsquo;s just a shake-down supported by the CWL.<br>

Why stop in England, Ahmed? You have many, many friends in the U.S. that can&rsquo;t wait to live in a third world country under Muslim law. England is already well on it way to being a third world hellhole. Why not come to America and help us experience vibrant diversity?</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s right. Britain with her sell-out politicians has been an amazing sucker and push-over for helping even non-assimilating illegal immigrants. Of course millions of poor immigrants are on the way.</p>

		<p>In the 14 months before the Sangatte hostel closed in 2002, a single ferry line, P&O;, said they had found 6,800 stowaways in the backs of lorries. This meant that around 500 a month had succeeded in penetrating security. The Calais port security chief Herve Couret, told regional paper Nord Littoral that three out of four migrants arrested were caught trying to break into or board lorries. A further 1,501 were caught on video surveillance trying to jump fences, he said. Mr Couret also said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very serious.&#8221;  Some time ago, Britain sent some specialist X-Ray equipment to Calais to rapidly check sealed lorries and containers for human occupants. The French refused to allow the equipment to be used unless the illegal immigrants gave their prior written permission as it would infringe their human rights!! Invaders attempting to reach Britain using the &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; excuse will soon be able to claim that status in France in terms of a new European Union plan. The mad scheme, negotiated between EU Vice President Jacques Barrot and crazed leftist British Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will allow &ldquo;asylum seekers&rdquo; to claim asylum in Britain while still in France. In terms of the deal, Brussels intends to create a purpose-built &ldquo;asylum support office&rdquo; in Calais and alter the Dublin Convention to allow refugees to demand sanctuary in one country while in another. Jacqui (bath-plug) Smith is no longer in the government but there is no updated news to suggest that this ridiculous scheme was ever actually cancelled. So, here we are, another fine June day in 2009, still facing hordes of benefit claimants who will demand immediate housing and lots of spending cash in return for nothing whatsoever. Thanks Brown and your despised labour government, thanks a lot, thanks for ruining England.</p>

		<p>This mess is the direct result of the Schengen Treaty,which brought in an open border policy throughout the EU.The French mayor does have a point however,as New Labour have deliberately<br>
imported a third world neo-proletariat to replace their  diminishing power base among the English working class.Put simply<br>
these people and their ever multiplying offspring are now the foot soldiers of the Blairite war of genocide on the English nation.<br>

<p>There is definitely plenty to criticize concerning &quot;UK&rsquo;s lax asylum
system and benefits culture&quot;. But the UK isn&rsquo;t the one allowing ILLEGALS to
stay in France. If France maintained it&rsquo;s own borders they wouldn&rsquo;t be there.
And if France deported them they wouldn&rsquo;t be there, either. Instead they pass
the buck by demanding that England take them.  It&rsquo;s just too bad this didn&rsquo;t happen before the
elections.</p>

		<p>Once arrived in the UK these people usually disappear into the &#8216;black economy&rsquo; of casual and frequently semi-criminal and criminal work. They are victimised by people in the know about them and often live in terrible conditions. Wouldn&rsquo;t life in France where they are be better?</p>
<p>I can understand why Ahmed from Afghanistan wants to live elsewhere than his war-torn country. But why the UK? </p>

		<p>Yes, you can dismiss these louts as being the &#8216;great unwashed&rsquo; or &#8216;rent-a-mob&rsquo;, wet-behind-the-ears pubescent anarchist wannabes who think they are being &#8216;clever&rsquo; and &#8216;meaningful&rsquo; by their pathetic acts of vandalism, but the unfortunate fact sis that their actions however crude and foolish are matched entiterly by the &#8216;great and the good&rsquo; at the WSJ and &#8216;Economist&rsquo; who advocate exactly the same thing, but only those smooth-talking, pompous shysters (in fact they are even nuttier than the louts), unfortunately have the ear of the politicians, who hang on to every erucation of their foul, verbal flatulence like it was word from on high.<br>
 Sad, but true.<br>
