			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Kent, Washington Times, June 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thursday&rsquo;s U.S. Supreme Court decision in Horne v. Flores drives another nail into the coffin of bilingual education, the teaching theory in which immigrant children are segregated by language and taught primarily in their native language while being taught English on the side.</p>
<p>Bilingual education is a documented failure in school systems across the country, and the 5-4 decision, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., involving Arizona&rsquo;s Nogales Unified School District emphasizes this failure with a stark conclusion: Teach English. Specifically, the high court recognizes the demonstrated effectiveness of structured English immersion (SEI) methods for teaching English language learners (ELL).</p>
<p>In 1992, some students and parents in the district sued the state, claiming it wasn&rsquo;t taking &#8220;appropriate action&#8221; to overcome barriers to ELLs in schools. The state responded with English-immersion techniques. {snip} Here&rsquo;s what the high court concluded: &#8220;Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education. Findings of the Arizona Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also concluded that a lower court had failed to adequately consider whether the Nogales school district&rsquo;s implementation of SEI was a &#8220;changed circumstance&#8221; warranting relief.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, new numbers just released by the Arizona Department of Education estimate that 40,000, or 29 percent, of ELLs enrolled in SEI classes passed the English fluency exam and will transition into mainstream classes this year. That is up from just 17,813 students, or 12 percent, of ELLs who passed the English-fluency exam after being enrolled in bilingual education classes in 2006-07.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Nogales school district is doing exactly what the law requires  &mdash;  taking &#8220;appropriate action&#8221; through English immersion techniques to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could have cited many more SEI success stories. {snip}</p>
<p>A recent study by the Editorial Projects in Education also spotlights Massachusetts education and chronicles further encouraging news about English learners. Compared to English learners across the country, 36 percent of the state&rsquo;s ELL students reached a proficient level in English, as opposed to just 16 percent nationwide. If that level of success holds true each year, most kids would learn English quickly enough to be out of special programs in two to three years at most.</p>
<p>Nogales school officials were trying to follow a successful model in spite of a vocal multilingual lobby that seeks to coddle non-English speakers in our classrooms. Yet polls continue to show that more than 90 percent of all Americans view English is the nation&rsquo;s unifying language  &mdash;  a common tongue that enables job-seeking legal newcomers to participate in the American dream. The Supreme Court couldn&rsquo;t have sent a clearer signal: Get rid of bilingual education and give English language learners a real opportunity to learn English and succeed.<br>

		<p>Nothing can destroy a country faster then the Trojan horse of &#8220;bilingualism&#8221;. It is a cover for a covert agenda that bodes no good at all for the unilingual speakers of the nation in question being targetted. Canadians were sold a pack of lies in the 1960&rsquo;s about how &#8220;bilingualism&#8221; was &#8220;good&#8221; and wouldn&rsquo;t hurt English-speakers. Utter rubbish. You don&rsquo;t want no part of it.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad decision, but it&rsquo;s a moot point in my opinion.  The real issue is that these kids are non-whites and will never fully integrate into western society, eventually making whites a minority in their own country.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why anyone here would actually support the idea of &#8216;English as the nation&rsquo;s unifying language&rsquo;. It contradicts the whole goal of ethnocultural preservation, which I&rsquo;m assuming most people here subscribe to. I don&rsquo;t want to force a &#8216;common tongue&rsquo; on anyone; to me, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to expect people who don&rsquo;t have a drop of English blood (or even closely related ancestry) to learn English and become &#8216;unified&rsquo; with everyone else. It only serves the interests of deracinated business elites who couldn&rsquo;t care less about maintaining distinct ethnocultural identities or genetic continuity. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it this way: linguistic homogenization is just one step further toward the full elimination of all barriers to complete genetic intermixture. </p>
<p>People should keep their own language. That goes not just for non-Europeans, but also to non-English speaking Europeans as well. </p>

		<p>both bilingual and immersion programs are useless in the real world. Teachers of these immersion kids who are then mainstreamed into the &#8220;English speakers&#8221;, i.e., blacks and Latinos who &#8220;speak&#8221; a dialect of English no business would accept in its employees,  will tell you these kids lack nuance and curiosity about American history or culture, let alone Europe. </p>
<p>Thus they barely read outside of school to obtain familiarity about the thousands of key words not taught in the bare bones basics only public schools. </p>
<p>The illegal immigrants and their anchor kids live in Spanish only neighborhoods. Lot of good the public school does when the kid spends most of the day in the equivalent of Sonora or San Salvador.</p>

		<p>Historama goes too far when he/she states that all nonEnglish speakers including Europeans should not be taught English in the US. </p>
<p>In Europe and China it&rsquo;s common for all students in academic high schools and colleges to learn English and often more than English in addition to the Native tongue. Many of us have met Europeans as tourists or business visitors to the US and are impressed with the fluency of their English. </p>
<p>Would our white school kids let alone our illiterate blacks and Latins speak English as well and  know US culture and history as well as our Chinese, Japanese and European visitors.  English fluency opens the door for some knowledge of Anglo Saxon and American culture and history. </p>
<p>We are either going to be Anglo Saxon or Spanish(Latin America, not Spain).  I choose Anglosaxon. IF the Hispanics and hip hop blacks don&rsquo;t like the mandate to speak conventional English, they should not be hired for jobs and should be encouraged to relocate. </p>
<p>\Lack of medicaid, food stamps, housing subsidies and federal jobs based on affirmative action provide a teeny bit of encouragement. </p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a difference between learning a language for business purposes or cultural fascination, curiosity, and imposing it on the population in the sort of legalistic manner in this present case.</p>
<p>Look, whether Amreners like it or not, America is not the kind of &#8216;unified white nation&rsquo; they believe it is. It never was, as a matter of fact. Today, it is basically like the Austro-Hungarian empire, except in this case our rulers don&rsquo;t like to openly acknowledge it, and instead they pretend that everyone is &#8216;American&rsquo; despite ethnic origin, cultural differences, etc. The Austro-Hungarian empire was just as diverse, but the rulers weren&rsquo;t so foolish as to pretend that the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; was a strength. They just tolerated it because they had to. America will NEVER recover from the sort of demographic blows that it suffered in the last century. </p>
<p>It is senseless to try to force English on everyone else and pretend that this will solve anything. It won&rsquo;t. Linguistic homogenization should never be pushed in the name of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo;, or &#8216;Anglo-Saxon hegemony&rsquo;, or any other reason. People should stop being confused about who they are, and develop their own communities where they can achieve a meaningful ethnocultural identity. In the Austro-Hungarian case, the different groups maintained their own languages and respected ethnic boundaries; imo, America should encourage the same, instead of trying to build this sort of mixed salad society where everyone tries to speak English and ignores their own background. Russian-Americans, for instance, can NEVER be northwest Europeans, so they should stop pretending that we&rsquo;re all in the same boat. It&rsquo;s stupid, inane, and ultimately destructive.</p>
