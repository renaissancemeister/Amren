			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Post, June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Embattled educator Madonna Constantine has a one-of-a-kind distinction: She&rsquo;s the professor that not even Columbia could stomach.</p>
<p>A panel of her now-former peers last month voted to uphold the decision of Columbia&rsquo;s Teachers College to fire Constantine for plagiarizing the work of her students and another professor.</p>
<p>Constantine, who is black and gained brief notoriety in 2007 after a noose was found attached to her office door, says she&rsquo;s simply a victim of &#8220;structural racism&#8221; at Columbia.</p>
<p>And her lawyer says he&rsquo;ll go to court to get her job back  &mdash;  on top of a $200 million defamation lawsuit he&rsquo;s already filed against her accusers and the university.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the legal system will sort through such matters expeditiously.</p>
<p>Still: If Columbia University wasn&rsquo;t cowed into backing down, you have to figure the charges against Constantine are pretty solid.</p>

		<p>What is &#8220;structural racism?&#8221;  It seems to me that every time a black person with at least a 90 IQ gets in trouble, it&rsquo;s blamed on &#8220;(fill-in-the-blank) racism.&#8221;  Seems to me that &#8220;structural racism&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean anything; she said it because she thought it sounded oh so high-brow and intellectual coming out of her mouth.</p>

		<p>The beauty of vaporous abstractions like &#8220;structural racism,&#8221; &#8220;institutional racism,&#8221; and especially the &#8220;legacies&#8221; (of slavery and Jim Crow) is that they cannot be proven to exist. They are somewhat like religious faith  &mdash;  and Constantine just knows deep in her heart that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; her down. Their appeal for trial lawyers is that they cannot be proven to not exist, so if the jury shares the plaintiff&rsquo;s fate, the money will pour in.</p>

		<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s &#8220;structural racism&#8221; that elevated the likes of Dr. Madonna Constantine to a tenured professorship at Columbia University in the first place.</p>

<p>The administrators of the college will discretely remind the esteemed professer of the never released videotape that probably shows her &#8220;noose-ing&#8221; her own office door.</p>
<p>If she doesn&rsquo;t wise up, they&rsquo;ll give her all the rope she needs to hang herself.</p>

		<p>That she&rsquo;s suing to get her job back is a tacit admission that she doesn&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s talented enough to get a similar high paying job at another university.</p>
<p>Then again, if not for affirmative action, most black college professors would be working at a car wash or at KFC.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Structural racism&#8221; is another term for reality when you don&rsquo;t like the status quo. When no apparent cause for racial disparities can be pointed to then the cause must be the institution, or structure, itself. Aptitude tests are racist because blacks do not do well and no other palatable excuse can be found. </p>

		<p>This &#8220;Professor&#8221; was riding the wave related to the noose on the &#8220;White Tree&#8221; in Jena, Louisiana, where a White Teenager was attacked for something that he had no part in. </p>
<p>When the six Black were arrested and Indicted for Assault, and several were charged as adults, the NAACP, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and all the Usual Suspects showed up and led a near riot, to have the boys released, and the charges dropped. </p>
<p>The fact that they almost beat a White Teenager to death doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter. </p>
<p>This &#8220;Professor&#8221; was hoping to gain form her &#8220;pain&#8221; of being a &#8220;Victim&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would like to know why she is not in Prison for perpetrating this Hoax?</p>

<p>Which means that multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious societies can never work. One group will always dominate in one area which leads to jealousy, anger, resentment, and violence.</p>
<p>Each group should live in homogeneous communities where they can &#8216;structure&rsquo; their own communities that work best for them.</p>
<p>Clearly white structured societies don&rsquo;t work for blacks and yet blacks insist to be a part of everything white and then complain about the privilege.</p>

		<p>I suspect that if this situation had occurred at a southern university that the columbia faculty would be harping about the &#8220;structural racism&#8221;. It&rsquo;s just that they don&rsquo;t like it coming back their way. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I don&rsquo;t think for a minute that there was any &#8220;structural racism&#8221;. But I think it would be poetic justice if she won. On the other hand, it would set a bad precedent which would make universities even more fearful of terminating a FRAUD. I just wish there were some way that they could BOTH LOSE.</p>

<p>Hope she win at trail.  Her lawyers work on contingency.  Then Columbia appeals and wins.  Columbia pays huge lawyer fees.  She get zero, her lawyers lose, and Columbia loses. A happy ending.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Exactly.  They are endlessly resentful.   But actually, though, white-structured societies DO work very well for blacks. They are the ONLY ones that do.  Where else do blacks have life so good as in the US, Canada, Europe?  They are stuggling and risking their lives to sneak into white countries.  Then they complain! Even in South Africa, they are better off as compared to the rest of that continent. All the prosperity, the order, the benefits, and the social services that blacks enjoy  (and use disproportionately)  are provided by whites.   Black-structured societies are a disaster everywhere   &mdash;   without one exception.</p>
<p>The problem is that  no matter how well off they may be in white-structured societies, blacks remain perpetually resentful and jealous, and they constantly complain. They want to have the cake and eat it too   &mdash;    which is an impossibility!</p>
<p>In the USA, they constitute only  12%  of the population, yet they seem to think they&rsquo;re entitled to claim 50% of everything.  Indeed, even if they had that, they would still  complain and want more.  There is no satisfying them. At the bottom, what they really want is a black-run society, with all the benefits of a white-run society.  Another impossibility.</p>
