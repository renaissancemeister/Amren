<h1>9 Things NEVER to Say to White Colleagues</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DiversityInc., June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frank McCloskey&rsquo;s wife of 31 years, Debbie, talked about her husband with her new coworkers, telling them about his job as vice president of diversity for Georgia Power. During lunch one day, Debbie, who is white, had just finished telling a story about Frank&rsquo;s diversity efforts when a colleague of hers said, &#8220;I want to tell you how courageous it is that you are married to an African American.&#8221; Oops! Frank is white.</p>
<p>Too often, white men  &mdash;  and to a lesser extent, white women  &mdash;  are assumed to have no role in diversity-and-inclusion efforts. But white people who are heterosexual, Christian and not disabled can and do champion diversity efforts. To assume otherwise is like assuming that talented Black or Latino executives do not exist.</p>
<p>To further explore stereotypes about white people in the corporate-diversity world, DiversityInc talked to several white men intimately involved in diversity-and-inclusion efforts. Here are nine things they suggest never saying to your white colleagues.</p>
<p><b>1. &#8220;You&rsquo;re a carpet-bagger&#8221; or &#8220;Why is a white guy doing this?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>It is often said in murmurs but not openly talked about that white people involved in the diversity industry are carpet-baggers, people involved for the money rather than the mission. Luke Visconti,CEO of DiversityInc [who is white], takes offense at such sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;A person at a financial institution [who works in diversity] said I&rsquo;m only making money from diversity. But if she is working in a diversity department, isn&rsquo;t she making money off of diversity also? Now that we got past the fact that we both make money on diversity, let&rsquo;s look at what we do for diversity,&#8221; says Visconti.</p>
<p><b>2. &#8220;You&rsquo;re not diverse&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Diversity includes white people. It is incorrect and insulting to use the word &#8220;diverse&#8221; to refer to people other than white heterosexual men with no ADA-defined disabilities. All people are included in the concept of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; As a result, properly executed diversity management benefits all people in an organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Visconti makes the point that in today&rsquo;s America, many white people have a personal involvement with traditionally underrepresented groups. {snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, Visconti affirms that to assume a white person cannot have a true, heartfelt connection with diversity is historically wrong.</p>
<p>{snip} Many white people have been and still are at the forefront of societal change to eliminate oppression and increase equity,&#8221; says Visconti.</p>
<p><b>3. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no way you as a white person can understand&#8221; </b></p>
<p>But the knee-jerk response is &#8220;If that&rsquo;s true, then why should I try to understand?&#8221; says Howard Ross, the white founder and chief learning officer for Cook Ross, a Maryland-based diversity consultancy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beat up your white colleagues by cloaking them in the shroud of &#8220;ignorant oppressor&#8221; while wearing the shroud of &#8220;victim.&#8221; Look for the personal stories that will develop commonalities and shared ideas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Visconti adds that saying you can&rsquo;t understand because you&rsquo;re white is treating a white person as if he or she is ignorant of culture and diversity issues. {snip}</p>
<p><b>4. White men are automatically &#8220;in the corporate in-crowd&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Being isolated or segregated from the in-crowd is not unique to executives who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, people with disabilities or LGBT people.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the most part, [white men] don&rsquo;t feel they&rsquo;re included or privileged,&#8221; says McCloskey. {snip}</p>
<p>McCloskey adds that corporate leadership must rid itself of subtle behaviors that create disengagement and mistrust, &#8220;not only for African Americans, women and other dimensions of diversity but also for white men.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>5. &#8220;You&rsquo;re just a typical white person&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Yes, Barack Obama said it and was thoroughly chastised for describing his white grandmother as a &#8220;typical&#8221; white person. The implication in such a statement is that all white people are alike, and that white people are all predisposed to be prejudiced. But characterizing anyone based on the presupposed behavior of a group is a slippery slope that leads to confusion and miscommunication, says Ross.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>6. &#8220;You KNOW you&rsquo;re being racist&#8221; </b></p>
<p>In the absence of concrete evidence, don&rsquo;t assume that a comment considered prejudiced was the result of a conscious thought process designed to stereotype, says Ross.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re learning that an overwhelming number of decisions people make are not made by bad intentions but are made by people blind to their own behavior,&#8221; says Ross. &#8220;Rather than assume that a person intended to be sexist or prejudiced, assume they didn&rsquo;t mean any malicious intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloskey adds that often people who are not white assume whites know their behavior is racist or prejudiced: &#8220;But being in a place of privilege is such a powerful place to be that the assumption is that everyone is living my life experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>7. &#8220;You talk about us when we&rsquo;re not around&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Being in the majority group provides freedom from the constant concern of race issues and fear of people who do not share your racial or ethnic background. So white people usually are not talking about Blacks, Latinos or Asian Americans when people from those groups are not around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally, we&rsquo;re being oblivious and doing our thing,&#8221; says Visconti. &#8220;Being oblivious doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad person. It just makes you oblivious.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>8. &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got all the money&#8221; </b></p>
<p>&#8220;My first response is, &#8216;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&#8221; says Jeff Hitchcock, executive director for the Center for the Study of White American Culture. He adds that while the majority of people who are poor are white, it is true that the percentage of whites who are poor is less than the percentage of Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans who are poor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hitchcock also says that many people mistake the make-up and the purpose of his organization, assuming that any reference to white culture must be a veiled reference to white supremacy. To dispel that notion, he put the following in bold letters on the center&rsquo;s homepage: &#8220;Not an organization for white supremacists as some people might infer, we are instead a multiracial organization that looks at whiteness and white American culture.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>9. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like white people&#8221; or &#8220;I don&rsquo;t get white people&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, people do communicate things like this. &#8220;In a business setting, a person probably wouldn&rsquo;t respond, but people can give off vibes,&#8221; says Hitchcock. &#8220;Sometimes I get that vibe from people of color and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s me giving off a vibe or it&rsquo;s them  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s probably both.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As a white person, you should be aware of that history and how that has led us to the present,&#8221; adds Hitchcock.</p>

		<p>The diversity industry? How big an industry is the diversity industry?</p>
<p>How many hysterics, opportunists and hustlers does it employ?</p>
<p>Who earns the money that pays them?</p>
<p>If your company hires a diversity consultant, isn&rsquo;t part of his/her/its/their fee paid by people who actually produce the good or service that brings in the money? Coulkd that money be better spent on real problems?</p>
<p>How do people qualify to be diversity trainers? Is there a course of study, a degree to be achieved, or a federal or state license to be obtained?</p>
<p>Or is it something handed over to glib poverty pimps and truculent women in comfortable shoes, in order to save the money that would be lost to consumer boycott or litigation mounted by all the victims white men oppress??</p>
<p>Is anyone else uneasy about this de facto smear of men who aren&rsquo;t black/brown/yellow/gay/crippled or saving up their dough for the final surgical procedure that will make them women?</p>
<p>How long will it be before we are rounded up and interned for the duration of the war against racism, sexism, ageism, classism, heterosexualism and able bodiedism?</p>
<p>These people are hysterical or just plain nuts, and there is very little time left for sane adults to dilute the effect their hysteria is having upon the body politic.</p>

<p>California, Texas, New York, Georgia, and Hawaii have yet to get that memo. Neither have the schools, social services and the employers in Gary, Indiana, Detroit, Michigan, and Newark New Jersey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the people who made this diversity list, have been listening to White Nationalists. This new directive is a contradiction however. Making diversity white-friendly is making diversity fight against itself. Eveyone knows diversity stands for people of color, and promoting whatever their agenda is.  </p>

Frankly, I&rsquo;m not offended or upset by most of these questions and their underlying implications.</p>
<p>Unlike blacks, I&rsquo;m not afraid to be seen as who and what I am.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of white people who work in the &#8220;diversity industry&#8221; being insulted, abused, denied promotions, and discriminated against by their &#8220;diverse&#8221; co-workers.   They make their livings by pushing more white people out of jobs, encouraging corporate managers to discriminate against us, and telling us white people how wicked we are.</p>
<p>As Bob Whitaker said, diversity means fewer whites.  So let the diversity industry be maximally diverse.<br>

		<p>Anybody who works in an industry where these kinds of thoughts are discussed or worried over would be better off selling pencils on the sidewalk in a remote all-white town.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not only in favor of avoiding blacks in the workplace and community, but I think they should be avoided everywhere on earth.</p>
<p>I realize some people are forced to work in such an environment, and I do &#8220;feel&#8221; for them.  But I have to say no amount of money would ever make me stay.</p>

<p>If one can only understand being x, or even any given facet of being x, by actually being x, then why do a-w, y, and z get to compare white understandings with their own?  I see this all the time, sometimes from the same people!  I.e., they&rsquo;ll go on for paragraphs about whitey&rsquo;s psychology, and then proceed to tell me whitey can never understand the mind of the x man!<br>

		<p>My company uses Diversity Inc. as it&rsquo;s foundation for all it&rsquo;s diversity measures.  The company was started by a white guy from New Jersey.  I&rsquo;ll give him credit, as a white dude he knew where the money-making opportunity was and went for it: Diversity.</p>
<p>You throw a white dude out of a three-story window and he will land on his feet and find a way to make money from it.  If there&rsquo;s oil in the hills of Diversity, he will build the rig to get it out of the ground&hellip;</p>

It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what to make of this. Why have people who make their living denouncing whites suddenly decided that maybe whites aren&rsquo;t COMPLETELY evil after all? What gives? </p>
<p>I suspect what it means is that the professional Diversitoids are (belatedly) waking up to the fact that white people don&rsquo;t enjoy their employer-mandated self-flagellation auto-criticism sessions. Maybe these particular anti-racist trainers have been getting an earful from non-self-hating whites   &mdash;   and have calculated that they&rsquo;d better stop ideologically whipping caucasians quite so hard or their whole Diversity Training Seminars house of cards might come tumbling down. </p>
<p>Of course, if the Diversitoids were REALLY paying attention to white people&rsquo;s reactions to their race-baiting scams, they&rsquo;d know that our anger is at the point that what we want from people like them is not to be included, but for them to LEAVE US ALONE. If the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; industry truly wanted to do us a favor, they&rsquo;d dissolve all their silly indoctrination schemes and go get REAL jobs in the private sector. </p>
<p>But we all know THAT&rsquo;S not gonna happen anytime soon&hellip;</p>

		<p><i>1. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a carpet-bagger&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why is a white guy doing this?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This belongs in the &#8220;things not to say to a honkey carpet-bagger Uncle Tom&#8221; list I think.  I&rsquo;d just laugh for a few minutes in response, as I&rsquo;m the diametrical opposite.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not diverse&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Laughter*  My politics are extremely diverse.  And divergent!  But seriously, let&rsquo;s talk phenotype and culture&hellip;</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you as a white person can understand&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you as a non-white person can understand.</p>
<p>4. White men are automatically &ldquo;in the corporate in-crowd&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Laughter*  You&rsquo;re talking to a man who grew up with more black neighborhood friends than he did white.  Who has cleaned toilets and cut lawns for a living.  The idea that you know my background is laughable.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a typical white person&rdquo;</p>
<p>Untrue, I can admit wanting my grandchildren to look like my grandparents.  And to wanting my grandchildren&rsquo;s environment to look like my grandparents&rsquo; environment.</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;You KNOW you&rsquo;re being racist&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play &#8220;who&rsquo;s the bigger racist&#8221;! </p>
<p>7. &ldquo;You talk about us when we&rsquo;re not around&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we do.  You should see what white men say about the whole lot when there are only other white men around.  Especially southern white men!</p>
<p>8. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all the money&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Pulls lint out of pocket and gives it to idiot* &#8220;There, now you have my share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>&#8220;Who made whitey rich in the first place?  (if they respond &#8220;it&rsquo;s ill gotten gain&#8221; then reply, &#8220;so now you want a share in stolen goods?  Does that mean you&rsquo;ll share the blame too?  Oh wait, you can&rsquo;t do that, sorry, forget I said anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like white people&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get white people&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dislike you, as an individual.</p>
<p><br>
What, was 10 that bad?  Ah well, not clicking through for that nonsense.  I might write a list of the top 10 worst things to say to a Real White Man though.</p>

They make their livings by pushing more white people out of jobs, encouraging corporate managers to discriminate against us, and telling us white people how wicked we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  I am a white female in my twenties.  I work in the &#8220;diversity&#8221; industry.  It is my personal mission to enforce fair treatment FOR ALL.  In no way are my job duties directed only at helping minorities. </p>
<p>And for the record, I am far from liberal.  Although this generally surprises my super liberal NYC co-workers, I am who I am and I am honest about it.</p>

		<p>To sbuffalonative,</p>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t mind being called a stereotypical white man because the connotations of being White are entirely a positive thing from your point of view, despite the negative view a minority might hold about your White status. On the other hand, calling someone a stereotypical Black man is a huge insult to just about anyone no matter what race.</p>
<p>In fact, I have awoken quite a few White men by criticizing their behavior as typically Black. And I mean it in a constructive way, because no matter what one&rsquo;s views on race are, once a White guy realizes that he&rsquo;s behaving like a Black man, he usually makes the effort to correct that mistake.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So let the diversity industry be maximally diverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>It already is. A white power report showed that in 16 out of 17 agencies of the federal government, whites were greatly underrepresented as compared to their percentage of the population. At the Equal Opportunity Department (where one would expect to find the most equality) whites were underrepresented by over 600%.</p>
<p>This is just how well they are represented compared to their overall population of the United States, and not to the age group of those either holding a job or holding a job with the federal government (the non-white population in the US has an average age close to 20 years of age (not even in the job market) while the white population has an average age close to 40.)<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve actually heard of several of the people mentioned in that article. I thought some of you might be interested in Jeff Hitchcocks bio from one of the organizations he&rsquo;s a member of.<br>
<br>
<i><b>CURE: Caucasians United for Reparations and Emancipations.</b></i><br>
<i>Jeff Hitchcock co-founded the Center for the Study of White American Culture in 1995 and continues today as Executive Director. In 2003, under his guidance, the Center started the White Anti-racist Community Action Network, an online community of more than 1,200 members. He is author of the book, Lifting the White Veil: An Examination of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
He started a publishing company that has published two additional books, including Walk with Us by CURE member Elizabeth Gordon. Jeff writes and speaks on the topics of white American culture, white privilege, and what white people can do to help create a multiracial society. He is a reparations advocate and has been a member of CURE since 2003. Some of his work is carried out in his faith community, Quakers, and he will soon have an article on reparations published in a major periodical with Quaker readership, the Friends Journal.</i><br>

		<p>I am a &#8216;typical white guy&rsquo;?  Why, yes, I help build empires.  As far as diversity, it&rsquo;s just another way of saying White displacement and carries a bad connotation for white thinkers.  It would really be hard not to have bad feelings for a White who works towards corporate diversity.</p>
<p>Just imagine the power we would have if we united.</p>

<p>Just so. You can&rsquo;t make a (very lucrative) career out of hectoring,harassing, bashing and scapegoating white people and then say. &#8220;well, there are certain things you shouldn&rsquo;t say to them or they will get angry or have their feelings hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we are 1% as evil and racist as they say we are, then why should anyone care if we get angry or have hurt feelings.</p>
<p>Sounds like the diversity gaulieters are getting soft and starting to think of whites as almost human. This will not do! I am calling on Tim Wise or Louis Farrakhan to come in and give them some remedial training.<br>

<p>You sound like you have pure motives and good intentions, but you&rsquo;re young, and apparently quite naive. </p>
<p>Your &#8220;personal mission&#8221; is irrelevant. Your higher-ups have no interest in enforcing fair treatment for white people, and certainly not at the expense of any bad will from any minority groups. There&rsquo;s simply no angle to it.</p>
<p>Whatever your personal mission might be, promoting the interests of non-whites, often at the expense of more competent whites (though not always) is your bosses&rsquo; professional mission. They will make it yours as well.</p>

		<p>This article is pathetic.</p>
<p>All of these &#8216;statements&rsquo; are racial accusations meant to put Whites in an apologetic, groveling position.</p>
<p>You will never win from a lame, defensive position no matter what your say. You will be perceived as weak as you try to futility defend yourself to non-Whites and prove you not a racist like all other Whites. </p>
<p>If a black called me a Carpet-Bagger I would immediately ask him to define the term, doubtful he would have a clue as to its meaning.</p>
<p>Or, you could tell them forcefully the following, courtesy of FredonEverything:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;You seem perfectly willing to live in a world that White European males built. ..Look around you and see whether you can find anything, with a moving part, that isn&rsquo;t the work of White Europeans. You might start with your refrigerator, which you probably don&rsquo;t understand. What about your hair dryer? You do know how an electric motor works?</p>
<p>To you, a computer is a commodity&hellip;.White, Europeans, mostly dead, of phenomenal brilliance developed the underlying math and theory: Gauss, Newton and Leibniz, LaGrange, Shannon, Hamilton, Galois, perhaps Minsky. </p>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t like Whites try spending a week without the things that White have foolishly provided for you, so that you can complain in comfort.<br>
You could begin by taking you fillings out. (Dentistry is not low-tech. Try making a drill burr spin at 350,000 rpm or whatever the current figure is.)  Next you could toss everything electrical and mechanical. You would soon find yourself sleeping in a hollow log and eating bugs&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expect to be shouted down by those who were taught that blacks and other non-Whites invented the modern world and all of its technology.  Remember this is what the K-12 textbooks teach, along with a belief that everything attributed to Whites was stolen from indigenous cultures around the world, that this entire society was &#8216;built upon the backs of non-Whites for the benefit of Whites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, trying to explain these things to those with double digit IQs and an inherent inability to reason will be difficult if not impossible and therefore a waste of time  &mdash;  kind of like trying to &#8216;prove&rsquo; you are not a racist..</p>
<p>It is not possible to debate, reason or argue with those who have been ingrained from birth with the dogma that Whites are the evil scourges of the world and that unless Whites are forcefully tethered down or eliminated by the government, they will resurrect slavery, the Third Reich,  Jim Crow laws, and outright pogroms against non-Whites.</p>
<p>We should have kept our innovations to ourselves and locked the doors to others permanently in the 20s.</p>

<p>While on it&rsquo;s face this may seem to be true, what people don&rsquo;t realize is that white people will never stop creating&hellip; achieving&hellip; improving&hellip; building.  The minorities may have chased us out of our cities but we have created amazing suburbs.</p>
