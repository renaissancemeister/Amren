<h1>Stressed-Out Border Guards Won&rsquo;t Be Coming Back: Union</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jorge Barrera, Canwest News Service, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most of the border guards who work at a closed Canada-U.S. crossing in eastern Ontario at the centre of a dispute between Ottawa and Mohawks won&rsquo;t return to work at the site even when the matter is settled, the guards&rsquo; union said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ron Moran, president of the Customs and Immigration Union, said the majority of the 37 guards who work at the Cornwall Island, Ont., crossing have been told by their doctors not to return to work as long as the border crossing remains on the island, which is on the Akwesasne Mohawk reserve straddling the Ontario-Quebec-New York State borders. Doctors have warned guards that the tense relationship between guards and the community is too stressful and might have adverse health effects.</p>
<p>The crossing was shut by the Canada Border Services Agency to the general public on May 31, after the Akwesasne leadership said the community would not allow the planned arming of border guards the next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the office were to reopen, there would not be enough of a compliment of officers to run at it at this stage,&#8221; said Moran.</p>
<p>Moran said he doesn&rsquo;t believe that the government will ever reopen the border post, which sits on an island in the St. Lawrence River, about 100 kilometres west of Montreal. He said the government likely would choose to set up beside the U.S. border post on the southern shore of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has reached a point of irreconcilable differences between the law enforcement service and segments of the community,&#8221; said Moran. &#8220;My educated guess is that they will open the Canadian operation and set it up on the U.S. side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moran said issues arising from having a Canadian border crossing on U.S. territory could be worked out.</p>
<p>The Akwesasne leadership has said it won&rsquo;t discuss arming guards at the post until the federal border agency settles outstanding concerns raises by local residents who say they have faced harassment and racial profiling from border guards. Federal court lawsuits and human rights complaints have been launched against the agency.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan&rsquo;s office said that they had been informed by the union that the guards would not return &#8220;unless they can be assured of their safety and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Van Loan has also said his department was studying the &#8220;long-term viability&#8221; of the Cornwall Island post.</p>
<p>Akwesasne Chief Larry King said no one has yet bothered to discuss any of these issues with the Mohawk leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of these discussions are happening all around us and not with us,&#8221; said King. &#8220;People are talking about Akwesasne, but not to Akwesasne .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is not healthy with the situation at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Akwesasne leadership has said they don&rsquo;t want armed border guards on their land, while the CBSA has said arming guards is part of a national policy. The agency plans to arm 4,800 guards across the country by 2016 with 9mm sidearms. The CBSA began the process in August 2007, and there are now 917 armed officers at border posts across the country.<br>

		<p>  This is an interesting article, discussing, at the present time, not one, but two «stand - offs» between Indians (so - called «First Nations»), and White «kanadians.» The «other» confrontation is the confrontation between Brantford Mohawks and an the Ontario government (which, in fact, is siding with the Indians in order to avoid another «Oka»), at Caledonia, in south - western Ontario. There, too, Indians have closed roads, disrupted traffic and commerce, and generally, conducted themselves in an manner aggressive, belligerent, hostile and intimidating. And violent.</p>
<p>  I am very familiar with this port of entry; anyone who lives on either side of the 49th parallel, in either south - western Québec/Northern New York State, or even as far east as Northern Vermont, would have taken «the bridge» in order to «short turn» thru either Northern New York, to Cornwall, Ontario, or the «Suroît» region of Southern Québec, just west and south of Montréal.</p>
<p>  I remember, in fact,  going over the bridge in the early 1970&rsquo;s on a trip to and from Lake Placid, New York. And, pertinent to this recollection, I in fact believe that the Canadian «Post» was on the Cornwall side. At the base of the kanadian approach to the main span. </p>
<p>  There is to this day, an traffic circle, which one negotiates as one approaches or leaves the bridge ramp,  which I believe was the original site of the kanadian post. It was only moved onto Cornwallis Island (otherwise «the Reserve»), sometime during the late 1970&rsquo;s or the early 1980&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>  Moving the post back to Cornwall would be awkward; but, with the Keynesian «pump priming» currently «in vogue» in both the United States and «kanada» the money would be available. And the project would be an convenient excuse per which to make use of it. At least on the kanadian side.</p>
<p>  With regard to the Canadian Customs Officers «fear and stress» regarding their refusal to return to their jobs, I have little, if any sympathy. Whereas the degree of courtesy on the part of the USC&E; (Customs and Excise) declined after 2001; the «kanadian» border bureaucrats were always far more crass, and impolite than their American «business rivals» 100 yards to the south.</p>
<p>  Furthermore, not to take the Indians side, but I recall an incident in which an resident of «the res» was so exasperated (rightly or wrongly), by an «kanadian» customs agent that he assaulted him in the booth.  </p>
<p>  With further reference to the deployment of firearms to the border agents,  the American agents carry them, the «native police force» (the so - called «Peace Keepers»), carry them,  and the Indians themselves have everything from standard .223/.308 hunting rifles to AK - 47&rsquo;s AR - 15&rsquo;s and grenade launchers (I used to see their ads in American border newspapers in the 1990&rsquo;s, advertising these items for sale). </p>
<p>  The real problem currently, and one that is suppressed by the media, concerns the fact that the Cornwall border crossing is an important port of entry, both back and forth, for road way commerce. With the bridges closed, trucks will have to detour further east, and then south thru Port Covington. South West of Montréal. Or, even further east, to the border crossing at Lacolle, Québec, due south of Montréal.</p>
<p>  Also,  the «kanadian» government, in an classic example of an Third World style «shake down» continued to charge a toll for the «privilege» of using the bridges, years after the Americans, evenn in highly taxed, highly regulated New York State, had abandoned this form of mean - spirited government extortion. The bridge has been up for at least 50 years; it has certainly long since been paid for. </p>
<p>  The aggressive belligerence of the Indians is deliberate and calculated; they know that the kanadian government, obsessed with the importance of presenting «kanada» as an happy, diverse, multicultural nation,  are, literally, terrified by the prospect of «another Oka.»  I don&rsquo;t know how the matter will be resolved. But I am confident that the government will agree to whatever the Indians demand. </p>

		<p>Simple solution to this. Instead of moving the line forward to U.S soil, move it back declaring the reservation a no mans land. They&rsquo;ll soon be begging for law enforcement.</p>
