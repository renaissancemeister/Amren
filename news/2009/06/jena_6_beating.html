<h1>&#8216;Jena 6&rsquo; Beating Case Wraps Up with Plea Deal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Foster, AP, June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five members of the Jena Six pleaded no contest Friday to misdemeanor simple battery and won&rsquo;t serve jail time, ending a case that thrust a small Louisiana town into the national spotlight and sparked a massive civil rights demonstration.</p>
<p>State District Judge Tom Yeager then sentenced the five, standing quietly surrounded by their lawyers, to seven days unsupervised probation and fined $500. It was a far less severe end to their cases than seemed possible when the six students  &mdash;  all of whom are black  &mdash;  were initially charged with attempted murder in the 2006 attack on Justin Barker, a white classmate. They became known as the &#8220;Jena Six,&#8221; after the central Louisiana town where the beating happened.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barker and his family and friends sat without expression throughout the hearing. Barker&rsquo;s attorney said he graduated and is now an oil field worker. The family did not comment.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, one of the attorneys read a statement from the five defendants in which they said they knew of nothing Barker had done to provoke the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, not one of us heard Justin use any slur or say anything that justified Mychal Bell attacking Justin nor did any of us see Justin do anything that would cause Mychal to react,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The statement also expressed sympathy for Barker and his family, and acknowledged the past 2 1/2 years had &#8220;caused Justin and his parents tremendous pain and suffering, much of which has gone unrecognized.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By pleading no contest, the five do not admit guilt but acknowledge prosecutors had enough evidence for a conviction. LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters said in a statement that he could have won convictions but wanted to end the matter for Barker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each paid the fine and court costs immediately. The payment of restitution to Barker was also part of the deal, but the amount was not released. A lawsuit filed by Barker against the group was also settled Friday, though the terms were confidential.</p>
<p>The only member of the group to serve jail time was Bell, who pleaded guilty in December 2007 to second-degree battery and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.</p>
<p>Four of Friday&rsquo;s defendants have graduated from high school, and all are attending or getting ready to attend college. Purvis has completed his first year and Bell is planning to attend college this fall. Beard is a senior in high school in Connecticut.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can move along with their lives,&#8221; said Bailey&rsquo;s attorney, James Boren. &#8220;And because there are no felonies they can look forward to full lives ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The severity of the original charges brought widespread criticism and eventually led more than 20,000 people to converge in September 2007 on the tiny town of Jena for a major civil rights march. Some $275,000 was raised to hire a large defense team for the six, said Beard&rsquo;s attorney, David Utter.</p>

<p>They were guilty from the start and after all the lies, they were forced to admit their guilt.</p>
<p>As with Rodney King, we&rsquo;ll be hearing about these boys in years to come. As Shakespeare said, &#8220;what&rsquo;s past is prologue&#8221;. They are what they are; thugs for life. Word.<br>

		<p>Barker was beaten to within an inch of his life.  Had the races been reversed, the five defendants probably would have been charged with a hate crime.  They could very well have been convicted and spent years in prison. </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not dwell on such trivial matters.  Instead, I request a moment of silence to recognize the achievements of that pillar of society, Michael Jackson.          </p>

<p>No, it was not &#8220;the severity of the original charges,&#8221; it was a kook left wing Dallas preacher named Alan Beany Baby that rode into town and stirred up stuff.</p>
<p>The plea deal is called an Alfred Plea.  I wish DA Walters would have taken it further, but we&rsquo;re not in his shoes.  Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t want to see another civil rights rabble rousing march in Jena.</p>

<p>You see?  </p>
<p>When a white is mobbed and beaten in a hate crime attack, the onus is on him to prove he never uttered a racial slur.</p>
<p>And how about this:  &#8216;&ldquo;They can move along with their lives,&rdquo; said Bailey&rsquo;s attorney, James Boren. &ldquo;And because there are no felonies they can look forward to full lives ahead.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, no.  Don&rsquo;t charge the darling little blacks with a felony just for trying to kill someone.  I mean, really, that would be &#8220;prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of what this country has become and a good number of the people in it.</p>

		<p>And here is the icing on the cake. Probation and a $500.00 fine for the Defendants, per the Council of Conservative Citizens&rsquo; article. That, for nearly kicking a White teenager to death. </p>
<p>Well, I know I have asked this before, but where are the mass rallies for the beating death, in almost the same manner, for Christopher Jones, and his family, when Christopher, a 14 year old boy, was knocked off is bicycle,a block away from his home, and punched, and kicked to death? </p>
<p>I am waiting, but I know in my heart there will be nothing for that boy Christopher, who did not deserve to die, because too many White people can&rsquo;t be bothered to DEMAND JUSTICE FOR HIM. </p>
<p>The White boy in Jena was almost killed. Christopher Jones was killed. How many other White kids need to die until our Community rises up as one to stop this insanity, or are you all just talk? I can&rsquo;t protest the Blacks, and Hispanics by myself. I would if I could, but it doesn&rsquo;t work like that. </p>
<p>And, since we are on the topic of cruel Black crime, with little hope for any real punishment, visit You Tube, and type in, &#8220;Man Robbed Had Eye Cut Out&#8221; and watch the Local News regarding two Blacks that robbed a White Convenience Store in South Carolina, and cut his eye out of his head. </p>
<p>I am sure that did not make too many Newspapers, or the National News, either. If someone didn&rsquo;t send it to me, I never would have heard about it. That&rsquo;s an effective News Black-out on these types of crimes. Be thankful for the Internet. </p>

		<p>i hate to say it, but more whites need to to be beat. they need to be beat off of their couches, beat away from their big screen tvs where they are watching american idol, beat out of their pizzas, beat out of their movies, beat out of their sports, their front door needs to be beat down by obamas storm troopers, they need to be beat into submission util they know what is going on in their country, beaten until they understand the politics of the country and how their country is being destroyed bcause of their apathy. beaten until they abandon their support of liberalism, and multiculturalism. beaten out of their jobs. beaten out of their support of white traitor liberal democratic politicians. well, you get the point. america can&rsquo;t turn around until this process takes place, and it will probably be too late.</p>

<p>Anon,<br>
I&rsquo;ll take that one step further. Most of the major Anti-White hate crimes didn&rsquo;t make the national news. The stories were limited to the localities where they occurred and even there the Black offender White victim angle was played down big time. I don;t have to list those incidents here. If you&rsquo;ve been reading AMREN for any length of time you know what they are. As you said were it not for Amren and its link to the Internet we wouldn&rsquo;t have any access to these stories and we&rsquo;d be walking around as zombie like as most of White America. We also have a few &#8220;Right Wing Conspiracy&#8221; talk shows host like Bob Grant, Michael Savage  and Steve Malzburg and bloggers like Michelle Malkin who have the courage to speak about these things. It&rsquo;s not about Whites vs, everyone else so much as it&rsquo;s WHites vs. a vary large percentage of young Black males who are  out of control sociopaths.</p>
<p>Danjack,<br>
You&rsquo;re right on as well. It was either Marx or Lenin who stated that religion is the opiate of the people. Today the &#8220;religion&#8221; is reality TV, sports and Insider, Access Hollywood etc. They have no idea what&rsquo;s going on right under their noses. Ignorance IS bliss until you&rsquo;re confronted by THAT of which you are ignorant. </p>

		<p>Why no hate crime? Because hate crime laws were created with the explicit intention of putting Whitey in jail and letting Whitey&rsquo;s assailant go free.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Four of Friday&rsquo;s defendants&hellip;are attending or getting ready to attend college. Purvis has completed his first year and Bell is planning to attend college this fall&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement just frosts me.</p>
<p>These animals tried to murder Baker are now attending college when they should be doing hard time in a federal prison for attempted murder with enhanced penalties for a hate crime.</p>
<p>From Pat Buchanan:  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.As Barker went for another exit, he was struck in the head from behind by Mychal Bell. Multiple witnesses say Barker fell unconscious as a gang of eight or 10 blacks stomped and kicked him in the head. The assistant principal who reached Barker thought he was dead&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>And for Purvis who just completed his first year of college:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;6-foot, 6-inch Purvis, who had transferred to Hebron High in Carrollton, Texas, was charged with assault, choking a student and ramming his head into a bench&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/mxb283</p>
<p>Yes, what college wouldn&rsquo;t be proud to have these fine young men on their campus!  </p>
<p>As for Baker, no scholarships or preferences for him.  He&rsquo;s working in the oil fields.</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, I suppose if they&rsquo;re attending a HBCU (historically black college/university) they&rsquo;ll be looked upon as heroes for nearly beating a White to death and then &#8216;Beating The Man&rsquo; in court on (what should have been) an attempted murder rap.</p>
<p>This will heighten and add to their street cred.</p>
