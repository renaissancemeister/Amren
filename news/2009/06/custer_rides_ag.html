			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Giago, Huffington Post, June 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Say it isn&rsquo;t so! Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer has invaded Lakota country again, this time through the Happy Meals sold to little children at McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Bobbie DuBray, Administrative Assistant for the Lakota Peoples Law Project was not only shocked by this apparent display of racial insensitivity, but also angered by it.</p>
<p>DuBray says, &#8220;I went through the drive thru at McDonalds on East North Street to get a Happy Meal for my five-year-old son. I got home and my brother opened the meal and found the Custer doll.&#8221; She said he then asked her to come and look at what he found. To her shock it was Custer toy. Her son wanted the toy and she told him, &#8220;No. that&rsquo;s a bad toy.&#8221; She said that her 10 year old daughter did not understand why the toy was bad. She and her mother, Betty Handley, then gave the girl a history lesson &#8220;My daughter was not taught about this in school. What are they teaching our children?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>DuBray, visibly upset by this experience, said, &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s insulting. It&rsquo;s like handing out KKK dolls in the south where there are a lot of Blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belva Morrison, Indian Child Welfare Specialist for the Lakota Law Project, said that DuBray told her about the doll incident this morning. Morrison said, &#8220;It is insensitive for local merchants to hand out these dolls where there is a large Indian population. They should have thought twice about promoting these figurines. I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re overacting. I think we are not tolerating things like this anymore. They&rsquo;re targeting young kids whose minds are easily impressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The question that immediately came to the mind of Jason Wolters, an Oglala Lakota, was, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the big shots at McDonald&rsquo;s realize what an insult this is to the Lakota people. Here was a man responsible for the death of many Lakota and a man responsible for discovering the gold that eventually led to the theft of the Sacred Black Hills of the Great Sioux Nation, and they have the audacity to hand out his likeness to children here in Rapid City, a town now fighting to prove it is not a racist community?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wolters compared the insult to putting a figurine of Adolph Hitler in a McDonald&rsquo;s Happy Meal served in Tel Aviv, Israel. &#8220;Most white people would never understand our perspective on this horrible faux paux, but to every Indian in America, the insult is obvious,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday several customers, white and Indian, visited different McDonald&rsquo;s shops in Rapid City and ordered Happy Meals. They soon discovered their packets did not contain a Custer figurine and motorcycle. They went to the counter and specifically asked for a Custer memento and were told there were none to be had. Customers buying Happy Meals without the Custer figurine were offered refunds on the meal if they so requested. It became apparent that McDonald&rsquo;s withdrew the offensive Custer figurines quietly and without comment.</p>

		<p>Where to begin.  Ah, I know:</p>
<p>1.  Custer did NOT discover gold in the Black Hills, he verified the presence of gold there.  The Sioux knew gold was there and did NOTHING to keep people away.  Prospectors had been there nearly two years before Custer appeared.</p>
<p>2.  Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but didn&rsquo;t the Sioux and other batches of American Indians (no such thing as native american indians) kill Custer at the Little Big Horn?  What is the problem?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Her son wanted the toy and she told him, &ldquo;No. that&rsquo;s a bad toy.&rdquo; She said that her 10 year old daughter did not understand why the toy was bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the mother has to prejudiced her child&rsquo;s mind with hate for a figure that was killed by an ambush of literally thousands of Indians.  The battle consisted of somethng like 268 troopers against multi-thousands of Indians.  </p>
<p>Afterwards, the Indian women attacked the corpses of the dead soldiers multilating them horrible in an orgy of both glee and hatred.</p>
<p>The indians started a fight they couldn&rsquo;t win, yet they continued to steal, rape, horribly torture, and massacre nearly helpless civilians, making no distinction in their fervor of killing between men and little children, babies and women.  </p>
<p>They have a sad story to tell right now because they lost the war that they refused to back off from, giving the white armies no choice but to respond to their hostilities.</p>
<p>I have no sympathies for them.  If they had been the victors there would be no whites here at all, because they would have all been tortured and murdered.  Frankly, I think their whining is disgusting, and I don&rsquo;t want to hear a bit of it.</p>

		<p>A few years back, I was at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society. There&rsquo;s a display showing the life of the Native Americans in the area when the &#8216;white man&rsquo; arrived.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sign that sheds some unflattering light on the alleged peaceful and bucolic Native American fantasy.</p>
<p>I took a photo of the sign. It&rsquo;s Native American history you won&rsquo;t read very often. Here it is verbatim:</p>
<p><b>&rdquo;When Worlds Collide&hellip;&rdquo;</b></p>
<p><b>Iroquois and European cultures collided after French Explorer Jacques Cartier established the first trading outposts along the St. Lawrence River in 1534. Control of the lucrative North American fur trade created intense competition between Native American groups as well as between the French and British governments. The Senecas gave the French a virtual trade monopoly in the Niagara Frontier when they permitted the construction of Fort Niagara around 1726.</b></p>
<p><b>While the French and British competed for allies and trading privileges, the Five Nations strengthened their own position around 1650 by warring with the Erie, Neutral, and Huron Nations. The Five Nations completely annihilated the Erie and the Neutrals and isolated the surviving Hurons from their allies.</b></p>

		<p> I understand from the history channel that the native americans had repeating rifles while custers men did not. so they were outmatched from the start. so they probably didn,t use arrows. also i understand from the history channel that custers body is the only one that wasn,t cut up and was left alone(for whatever reason) so probably wasn,t scalped. history is something else and percieved history is also interesting. thanks for the utube site.</p>

		<p>The ignorance of some posters here is embarrassing.  We kicked the Indians from one end of the continent to the other, destroyed their livelihoods and cultures, murdered and massacred them as much or more than they did us, and some Whites call THEM savage?  The wars between the Indian tribes, and between Whites and Indians, were struggles to secure resources.  There&rsquo;s not much morality to it, if I&rsquo;m facing starvation, I&rsquo;d just as soon smack that funny looking fellow in the head and take his lunch.  I feel no guilt for beating the Red men, and I blame no one, White or Indian, for fighting over the land.  But despising men who fought us bravely is, in my opinion, beneath a White man, any real man in fact.   </p>
<p>     Those who imagine that Indians were so much more savage than Whites ought consider, for example, that most of the scalps taken in the Ohio Valley during and after the Revolution were sold to Whites: Indian scalps sold to the Americans, White scalps sold to the British.  Did the Indians commit terrible tortures?  Yes, for example they slit the bellies of Simon Greathouse and his wife and wrapped their intestines around a tree.  The Indians remembered that Greathouse had led a massacre of unarmed Christian Indians, tying them up and burning them in their lodges.  Or next time anyone thinks Indians are uniquely brutal, they should think again of Lewis Wetzel, a hero to the frontiersmen, and one of America&rsquo;s worst serial killers.  Until he disappeared in his 50s, Wetzel killed any Indians he saw on sight, and scalped them.  War time, peace time, any time, man woman, peace envoy, Wetzel killed Indians, and when he was charged with murder, he was sprung by a posse that threatened to shoot down the platoon of soldiers guarding him.  His fellow frontiersmen were willing to murder United States troops to defend him, so highly did they approve of his savagery.  No question, Whites could match the Indians cut for cut when it came to cruelty.  </p>
<p>     We Whites have rivals, enemies, and sometimes people who are just in the way.  We are no different than any other race in that respect.  WN ought have enough respect for our own people that we don&rsquo;t have to pretend that we are better in ways that we are not.  When three American destroyers were sunk while attacking Japanese cruisers during the battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the Japanese captains ordered his men to line the rail and salute as his ship passed the Americans in the water.  Bitter enemy though he was, he was man enough to respect a brave opponent.  Self-respecting Whites should do no less.<br>

		<p>10 Anonymous: The Indians had a great variety of weapons, from repeaters to flintlocks and bows.  The repeaters didn&rsquo;t make any real difference because they did not have large stocks of ammunition for the various calibers.  Despite being gravely outnumbered, Custer could have survived had he not tried, when cornered, to defend a perimeter of 1.8 miles with a little over 200 men.  His two main subordinates, leading between them seven of the regiment&rsquo;s twelve companies, lived because they formed themselves into a couple compact defensible positions.  Neither of them had as many men as Custer had with him, but they fought more sensibly. </p>

<p>Spot on!  Due to the Orwellian memory hole that is our public &amp; private fool systems, few Whites today remember (and fewer American Indians want to remember) that it was the Lakota Sioux, together with other Indian allies, who massacred the peaceful and friendly Mandan Indians of North Dakota in order to steal their land.  </p>
<p>What made this massacre particularly despicable is the fact it came on the heels of a smallpox epidemic that devastated the Mandans&rsquo; numbers.  They literally and figuratively &#8220;kicked them while they were down.&#8221;  Similar scenarios had played out for countless millenia here before the coming of the White man.  Thus, I am deaf to their attempts at instilling any sense of guilt in me.</p>

<p>In speaking about ignorance, my friend, let me suggest that you read more thoroughly the entire history of the Indian atrocities, beginning with the articles Amren posted not long ago.</p>
<p>People like you &hellip; blindly attempt to rationalize Indian atrocities by pretending to be objective by declaring there were atrocities on both sides.</p>
<p>Forget about the brainwashing you received and read &#8220;Scalp Dance,&#8221; or Mark Twain, or any of a dozen authors who have written unbiased accounts.</p>
<p>I could go into detail, but the details are so grusome my comments wouldnt be posted.</p>
<p>Grow up.  We don&rsquo;t play cowboys and Indians anymore, and Tonto really wasn&rsquo;t the Lone Ranger&rsquo;s friend.</p>

		<p>Amendment to post 14: I&rsquo;ve got my killers mixed up.  Simon Greathouse didn&rsquo;t lead the massacre of the unarmed Christian Indians, that was a Colonel Williamson.  Greathouse started a war by murdering the family of Chief Logan, an Indian long friendly to Whites.  His greatest achievement on that day was to cut the unborn child out of Chief Logan&rsquo;s sister and scalp it.  (That Dark and Bloody River: Chronicles of the Ohio River Valley, by Allen W.

		<p>19 ice: I enjoy Mark Twain, but the last thing I&rsquo;d call him is unbiased.  Sarcasm and mockery were his bread and butter.  BTW, have you read the works he wrote later in his life, criticizing the U.S. and the Army for their atrocities?  He wrote that the U.S. flag should be redesigned, with black stripes substituted for the white, and instead of a blue field with white stars, a black field with red skulls and crossbones.  If you&rsquo;re a fan of the Grateful Dead, you can see that flag on the back of their record &#8220;Live Dead&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>21 Anonymous: Not only is the ignorance of some posters embarrassing to a WN like myself, the illiteracy of some is even more troubling.  &#8220;&hellip;disgraceful anti-White rant&hellip;straight out of the Marxist-Leninist textbook.&#8221;  R-E-A-D the post, (#14), all of it.  </p>
<p>Some people seem to have very fragile racial or national egos.  Their race or nation must be always blameless, always superior.  It reminds me of those Afrocentrics who claim that the Greeks stole all their ideas from Ethiopia, or the way that Soviet schoolbooks taught that Russians invented the airplane, the telephone, the automobile, etc.  Patriotism rooted in false beliefs is easily weakened when those beliefs are disproved.  I love my country and people despite their faults, and I&rsquo;d hate to have the case for White Nationalism depend upon the unblemished character of my ancestors.  </p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that sound like nearly every non-white that comes on here who is critical of this country and whites, but is pounding his chest about his people and the failed country he fled from?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it sometimes understandable that whites on here would assume an overly defensive attitude, especially in the face of egregious insults against us that keep coming non stop?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d hate to have the case for White Nationalism depend upon the unblemished character of my ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve read many posts from you, Schoolteacher, and I can&rsquo;t see that you have a perfect record in that regard yourself.  But, frankly, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever read of one instance where a poster here ever claimed his ancestors were perfect.  Usually the posts are defensive in nature in response to some kind of white denigration.</p>
<p>What irritates me are people who are supposed to have some unity as WN&rsquo;s blatantly criticize whites for not being tolerant or broadminded enough, when we&rsquo;re constantly being unjustly attacked from every faction in the world, especially if it involves the non-whites here who want to take over and dominate.</p>
<p>Incidentally, they&rsquo;re absolutely delighted to read posts like yours that are critical of whites today and our ancestors.</p>

		<p>24 Ranger: If we are not honest with ourselves about our own history and culture, how do we make credible criticisms of other&rsquo;s history and culture?  If we ignore our people&rsquo;s failings and errors, yet point out the failings and errors of others, how are we different from &#8220;&hellip;every non-White&hellip;pounding his chest about his people&#8221;, as you say?  If the Afro-centrists and Soviets were ridiculous for the claims they made, how are we less so if we re-write history as they did?  </p>
<p>Every healthy White is sick of the non-stop egregious insults and unjust attacks, but that&rsquo;s no excuse for denying history.  Why should I lie to my Race&rsquo;s accusers when I can beat them honestly, and trap them in their own lies?  Why should I have to argue in favor of honesty on a White website?  </p>
<p>If Whites have been argued out of our own country, it&rsquo;s not because we were too broadminded, it&rsquo;s because we were ignorant.  When Red professors and intellectuals pointed out our people&rsquo;s errors and failings, slavery, Indians, blah blah blah, naive young people were shocked to hear such things, and bought into the Red story line.  Like I said, (23) a patriotism rooted in false beliefs is easily weakened.  If you deny that Whites came to this continent and kicked aside the people who were already here, rather than acknowledging and understanding that fact, you are disarmed when you have to admit the facts.  Better educated students could have said, &#8220;And so?&#8221;, and forced the Reds to justify their WhiteIsBad/non-WhiteIsGood fairy tale.  The typical, ignorant, sheltered student can only say, Golly, isn&rsquo;t it awful, poor little BlackIndianMexicanChineseWomanGay, why are StraightWhiteMen so mean?  </p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care if anti-Whites are delighted to read my posts. I don&rsquo;t write for them, I write for racially aware, socially and historically curious Whites, including the many readers who never post anything.  If the diverse are delighted, they ought read what I write more closely.    <br>

19 ice: &#8220;I enjoy Mark Twain, but the last thing I&rsquo;d call him is unbiased. Sarcasm and mockery were his bread and butter.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Which doesn&rsquo;t mean that he didn&rsquo;t include&hellip;..or was incapable of&hellip;. much factual information in his writings.   Twain was quite an amateur scientist and historian/archeologist as well. To write off Twain as strictly satirical is just plain wrong.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;BTW, have you read the works he wrote later in his life, criticizing the U.S. and the Army for their atrocities?&#8221;<br>
 <br>
I have indeed.  But doesn&rsquo;t that contradict your first argument, above, that he wasn&rsquo;t unbiased?  Or factual? And, mainly a satirical, sarcastic  writer? <br>
 <br>
&#8220;He wrote that the U.S. flag should be redesigned, with black stripes substituted for the white, and instead of a blue field with white stars, a black field with red skulls and crossbones. If you&rsquo;re a fan of the Grateful Dead, you can see that flag on the back of their record &ldquo;Live Dead&rdquo;.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
And this proves exactly what?  I see no relevance to the  above to anything you&rsquo;re making reference to, except you&rsquo;re pointing out again that Twain was a satirical, mocking writer. <br>
 <br>
Twain&rsquo;s satire, his complaints, and even bitter condemnations later in life have absolutely nothing to do with his accounts of factual Indian atrocities.   <br>
 <br>
And, yes, his comments regarding US military atrocities are valid as well, but they were far fewer in number and were reactions mostly to Indian atrocities against white settlers. Certain white civilians commiting brutality does not give parity to the overall Indian massacres of whites nor does it offer an example of policy by the US military at the time.<br>
 <br>
Too, consider that the Indians were hardly all love and tolerance before the white man came.  Indians were killing, stealing, and torturing each other long before the white man came, so they just imposed their usual practice on whites and were almost smashed into oblivion on account of their criminal actions.</p>
<p>The conniving, deceit and manipulations by the Indians against whites, especially early on, reminds me of the account of the Boers trusting the Zulus in South Africa and suffering horrendous massacres because of it.</p>

__________</p>
<p>What does that prove?   Mark Twain lived long before the Grateful Dead and in no way can be held responsible for anything that they did.  To bring up the Grateful Dead in a desperate attempt to CYA is nonsense.  What does that have to do with Indian atrocities? </p>

<p> But yes you WERE re-writing history, in that you were dwelling solely on one side of it   &mdash;   and that is not the objectivity and lack of bias that you are now trying to claim.  We all know that we and our people are far from blameless or perfect, and no one has ever claimed that they were,  so don&rsquo;t try to imply that we have.  But your one-sided rant against whites is hardly what we need with so many other attacks going on. There are more than enough people telling us about our &#8220;sins&#8221; and rubbing them gleefully in our face.</p>
<p>For a long time I have seen schoolteacher/whiteplight make consistently anti-Christian remarks, anti-European remarks, and finally you make straight out, blatently anti-white remarks!   And now you try to make a specious claim that you were just being objective. No you weren&rsquo;t!  An objective person tells BOTH sides of a story.  You didn&rsquo;t.   Whose side are you  really on anyway?</p>
<p> <b>Every healthy White is sick of the non-stop egregious insults and unjust attacks, but that&rsquo;s no excuse for denying history. Why should I lie to my Race&rsquo;s accusers when I can beat them honestly, and trap them in their own lies? </b></p>
<p>Far from &#8220;lying to your race&rsquo;s accusers&#8221;, you were AGREEING with them and JOINING in the attack.</p>
<p>No, the Indians were NOT all gentleness and peace before the evil whites arrived and taught them violence and greed and upset their blissful paradise.    I&rsquo;ll say it again: that is a very Marxist, left-wingy view!   I have encountered that exact same allegation from Marxists, but I hardly expected to find it expounded here in Amren.  And don&rsquo;t try is dismiss it or duck around it  by calling me ignorant,   because I know very well what I&rsquo;m talking about. And so do you.<br>
