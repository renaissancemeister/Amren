			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Briena Barrett, WAtoday.com.au (Western Australia), June 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A rapidly expanding social networking site has been slammed for its racist taunts against immigrants to Australia.</p>
<p>The Facebook Group, F*** Off, We&rsquo;re Full, has nearly 65,000 members and believes any immigrants coming to Australia must adapt to what it calls the &#8216;Aussie lifestyle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;This idea of Australia being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity,&#8221; the site states.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Australians, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The website is full of debate on its discussion board. The latest topics put up for comment include: Will Indian race-rioters be hunted down? and All foreigners need to be euthanised.</p>
<p>Matt, an active member of the group, said he joined because he believed immigrants were ruining the Australian way of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why I joined it because I&rsquo;m a very proud Australian and I love this place and I wouldn&rsquo;t give it up for the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He believed the Federal Government&rsquo;s current immigration policies were too lenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally I think that it should be put out there that we will shoot or destroy any vessel that comes into the Australian waters without the applicable visas or the Australian Government knowing of their existence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Female member Courtney said she recognised the site was racist but stood by its beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe if you are going to come here, then do what we do and if you don&rsquo;t like it then leave,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Another member, who doesn&rsquo;t want his name used, mirrored this view.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see why it should be a problem to have a group that is basically of an opinion that our country is full at the moment and we don&rsquo;t need any more bloody third world immigrants coming over here and making things worse than they already are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Murdoch University senior psychology lecturer Dr Anne Pedersen said the Facebook members were contradicting themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we make people of colour assimilate to the white Australian culture, when in fact Indigenous people were the first people here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Project SafeCom coordinator Jack Smit, who advocates for refugee rights, said the site was incredibly offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop vilifying migrants and stop vilifying refugees who are running for their lives .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and need to come here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who attempts to exclude a whole swag of nationalities from what they regard as true Australians commits a form of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Pedersen believed shutting down the group would be pointless but said there was a limit to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in freedom in speech, but with free speech comes responsibility and this is irresponsible,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Australian Protectionist Party, which describes itself as the patriotic movement Australia is looking for, says multiculturalism is ruining Australia.</p>
<p>Party spokesman Darrin Hodges regularly uploads topic discussions on the site and says the Australian identity needs to be protected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every country does have its own culture and way of life and they should be looking to preserve that rather than turning all countries into a globalised mish-mash,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of protecting the identity, that comes back down to immigration and who is allowed into the country and who isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would see immigration turned back to the more traditional forces of being Europe and Great Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dr Pedersen said Australia was already a multicultural society and had been for a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re not white anymore, walk down the streets, we&rsquo;re not a white city anymore and thank god we&rsquo;re not, &#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for immigration minister Chris Evans said the Government strongly opposed the fostering of extremism, racial hatred, division and incitement to violence &#8220;and we condemn those who promote the vilification of ethnic groups within the community&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia is a country of migrants,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 45 per cent of our population .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was either born overseas or has at least one parent who was born overseas. This means that nearly half of all Australians are either migrants or children of migrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with the significant economic benefits of migration, Australia has been enriched by the cultures and traditions of migrants from more than 200 countries around the world who have chosen to make a home in our great nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities states that any content that is &#8220;unlawful, misleading, malicious or discriminatory&#8221; could be shut down.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s a terribly racist thing to say.  I wonder if she has a problem with other societies being &#8220;black societies&#8221; or &#8220;Asian societies&#8221;.  Will she visit Africa and preach to them how their societies are flawed because they&rsquo;re all black?  She&rsquo;d probably be killed within a week if she tried.</p>

		<p>Sounds like fascism to me.  It&rsquo;s funny that non-whites, and especially the groups that claim to represent, are always complaining saying that whites are holding them down and oppressing them, yet they turn around and shut down and criticism of them, even on facebook.</p>

		<p>Yes Facebook will kick off any pro white or site. </p>
<p>I have had over 30 groups kicked off. All with just facts of course. Not to mention I have been kicked off of Facebook many many times. </p>
<p>I guess if we were not right they would not fear us so much. </p>

		<p>Skip - Middle Eastern Muslims, especially Lebanese, are the group causing most problems here - this group commits about 70% of the violent crime (armed holdups, driveby shootings, etc) in Sydney and is overrepresented in our jails. This group commits so much crime that it has its own special police unit, the Middle Eastern Crime Squad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop vilifying migrants and stop vilifying refugees who are running for their lives &hellip; and need to come here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A sick joke. Indians here are not &#8216;refugees&rsquo; running for their lives, they are either economic migrants or students. Muslim Lebanese who holiday frequently in their homeland and identify themselves as Lebanese, but who suddenly become Australian and cry to the government to rescue them when things get too hot in HamasLand - another sick joke, except most Australians don&rsquo;t find either group remotely amusing. </p>
<p>The area where the trouble is happening has less than one third white Australian population - it is two migrant groups facing off, the Indians are now outnumbering the Lebs and the Lebs don&rsquo;t like it. What goes around comes around, eh? </p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia is a country of migrants,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m a sixth generation Australian, my ancestors built this country, I have nowhere to go if Australia becomes unliveable (except, like Matt, I &#8216;wouldn&rsquo;t give it up for the world&rsquo;), please tell me Chris Evans, how I am a &#8216;migrant&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re not white anymore, walk down the streets, we&rsquo;re not a white city anymore and thank god we&rsquo;re not, &rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the words to express my anger and disgust for this creature. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;enriched by their cultures and traditions.&#8221;  Spoken by a White Red who lives among other White Reds, works among other White Reds, and takes his leisure among other White Reds.  White Reds find non-Whites even more unbearable than we do, because they are compelled to kiss up to them and pretend that they are wise in ways that Whites are not.  </p>

		<p>This sentiment has been around in Australia for a long time, it has just never really had a &#8220;release&#8221; (unless you count Pauline Hanson - right message, wrong person to deliver it). People were complaining about Asian immigration from the time it really got going, around the early to mid 90s or so. Of course, since then it has exploded, as well as from all other corners of the globe.</p>
<p>If a group of intelligent, well-spoken folks can get together and start a political party, I have no doubt whatsoever they would have massive support. Of course the media makes it hard for any party like that to get a start, to gain any traction at the outset, but with perseverance I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d do well. </p>

		<p>Alot of news over the last few weeks here about the racial attacks on Indian students.  We have been bombarded with images of people in India protesting about the attacks, burning effigies of the Priminister, and generally decrying the evil of the white racist nation that is Australia (years of annoying telemarketing and they expect us to love them).</p>
<p>This week it is coming to light that the conflict is more between Indians and Lebs, 2 groups of immigrants with their own distinct cultures and religons that never fully intergrate into Aussie culture.  Now India is calling for the students to stop protesting and if you check Indian media the issue seems to have vanished.</p>
<p>A fantastic example of the benifits of a multicultural Australia. </p>

		<p>Pedersen and Smit are awful pathetic individuals. It is only the media, academia and Govt. that support the divisive policy of multi-culturalism and open third world immigration but to the Aussie in the street it spells the decline of civilisation.</p>
<p>We, in Australia suffer from the same apathy that exists in the States and all Western nations on matters regarding race. Australians get off the couch and stop being so apathetic. The more of us who get up and speak up for our rights, the better.</p>

<p>This is the truth for any country, plain and simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re not white anymore, walk down the streets, we&rsquo;re not a white city anymore and thank god we&rsquo;re not, &rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is it that Whites and only Whites should be expected to be happy for this? In Japan would any Japanese person say thank god we&rsquo;re not Japanese anymore, any Mexican in Mexico say thank god we&rsquo;re not Mexican anymore, any Nigerian say thank god we&rsquo;re not Black anymore??? The answer to that is of course no, only Whites are expected to accept ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Why should we make people of colour assimilate to the white Australian culture, when in fact Indigenous people were the first people here,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do immigrants today and their assimilation have to do with the indigenous people? Nothing.</p>

Skip - Middle Eastern Muslims, especially Lebanese,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right of course, the Lebanese muslims are also becoming/have been a troublesome spot in Africa for the U.S. government contracts there. First Kuwaiti sponsors many projects but let management go to Lebanese middle men* to take the fall when things fall apart and without fail, things have fallen apart. For examples, see the U.S. Embassy projects in Baghdad, Iraq. Gabon, Africa and at least one other in some island country.<br>
**this is because the U.S. government can do NOTHING to any<br>
  Kuwaitis because Kuwait/Saudi have the best Congress money can <br>

<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t blame them. If you can&rsquo;t keep it clean, you&rsquo;re not doing whites any &#8216;favors&rsquo;.

<p>So because whites conquered Australia, we should bring in more people to further displace the aboriginals?</p>
