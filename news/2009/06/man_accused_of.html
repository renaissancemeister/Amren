			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTV (Toronto), June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police have issued a public safety alert about a Toronto man who is accused of having unprotected sex with a partner he did not tell about his HIV-positive status.</p>
<p>The suspect is accused of having &#8220;unprotected sexual intercourse on multiple occasions&#8221; after learning he was HIV positive three months ago, but police allege he did not tell his partner about his condition.</p>
<p>While only one alleged victim has been identified, police say the suspect may have had sexual contact with members of both the gay and heterosexual communities.</p>
<p>Carlton Davis, 46, was arrested Thursday and faces four criminal charges, including attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault.</p>
<p>Det. Mark Niezen told ctvtoronto.ca that the suspect recently moved to the St. Clair Avenue and Bathurst Street area, though he previously spent time in area near Oak and River Streets, as well as the area near Jarvis and Gerrard Streets.</p>
<p>Anyone who had contact with Davis is asked to call police at 416-808-1304, or to call Crime Stoppers at 416-222-8477.</p>
<p>This is the second time in a month that police have warned the public about an HIV-positive man having unprotected sex with others without disclosing his status.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s warning also comes two months after Johnson Aziga, a 52-year-old Hamilton man, was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for infecting two women whom he did not disclose his HIV status.</p>
<p>Aziga is believed to be the first person in Canada convicted of murder for lethally infecting partners with the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>It is believed Aziga&rsquo;s legal representatives may be considering appealing his conviction.</p>

		<p>Sadly, my first thought was that most of his victims are more than likely White women.  <br>

		<p>  My question is&hellip; where is he finding sex partners, the school for the blind?! Seriously, judging by the photo, I fail to see what is attractive. His victims must be real winners too.<br>
The mind boggles!</p>

		<p>Common guys. The gentleman looks like such a stand up guy. LOL<br>
Anyway, most blacks in Canada that are in their 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s are probably immigrant. Many of them (the ones not from the Caribean)are from third world African countries. There are regions in certain African countries wjere HIV may be found in 80% of the locals. <br>
Now, I would never, ever wish a life altering disease on anyone no matter how stupid they are. However what the hell is someone thinking by not only bedding a African immigrant, BUT WITHOUT A CONDOM.</p>

<p>He must have been on the &#8220;down low&#8221;. Looking at his mug, one would have to be pretty sad to sleep with that.</p>

		<p>Anyone know which part of Nigeria, Sudan or Ghana he is from? I&rsquo;m sure he is from one of them and were any of his &#8216;conquests&rsquo; White?</p>
