			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristin Jensen and Jane Mills, Bloomberg News, June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A racially charged U.S. Supreme Court battle over New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter promotions plays out every day in the city&rsquo;s Dixwell Fire Station. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bruce Galaski, 38, a white firefighter who works along with Ricci in the Dixwell station, said that the promotion dispute has caused resentment in the department. </p>
<p>&#8220;Morale is terrible,&#8221; said Galaski, a 10-year New Haven veteran who chose not to join the suit against his employer even though he said he has been told he did well enough to qualify for promotion. &#8220;It&rsquo;s tough when you work hard and you don&rsquo;t get promoted because of the color of your skin.&#8221; </p>
<p>While blacks make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they make up just over 8 percent of the almost 300,000 professional firefighters nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. In some cities, the gap is even wider. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Supreme Court concludes its current term on June 29 with the New Haven ruling due to be handed down then. The decision will get extra attention because Sotomayor, President Barack Obama&rsquo;s nominee to replace Souter, sat on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in New York that ruled against the white firefighters last year. </p>
<p>Her position in the Ricci case essentially supports racial preferences embodied in affirmative action plans, said Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. </p>
<p>&#8220;It will be front and center for Republicans who want to oppose her,&#8221; said Dorf, who has written books on constitutional law and follows the high court closely. &#8220;That is the one real arrow they have in their quiver, and I would be surprised if they didn&rsquo;t shoot it over and over again.&#8221; </p>
<p>Senate Republicans such as John Cornyn of Texas and Susan Collins of Maine have expressed concern about the 2nd Circuit court ruling, though opposing Sotomayor, 55, the first Hispanic nominee to the high court, may prove treacherous. The Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings on her confirmation beginning July 13. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In New Haven, the city has been filling the vacant department officer jobs with temporary appointments based on seniority. Firefighters who support Ricci and his colleagues said promotions should be colorblind. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of guys are hoping there is justice for these guys,&#8221; said Mike Bresnan, president of the local Concerned American Firefighters Association in Philadelphia. &#8220;Some guys study for years, and for all that time and effort to be thrown out because the city doesn&rsquo;t like the color of the list is despicable.&#8221; </p>
<p>In Philadelphia, five firefighters sued in 2007, claiming the city and Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers conspired to manipulate the outcome of a promotional exam to favor blacks. The city settled the suit in January for undisclosed terms. </p>
<p>In Houston, seven minority firefighters sued the city last year over exams used to select captains and senior captains. Dennis Thompson, an attorney for the firefighters, said the tests &#8220;in essence inflate the performance of whites over minorities.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Be a Dinosaur&rsquo; </strong></p>
<p>Diversity and cultural experiences are important for first responders, Thompson said. &#8220;You can embrace it and adapt or you can fight it and be a dinosaur,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Firefighters say diversity can be especially important in emergencies. Victims may feel more comfortable when they see first responders who look similar to them or understand their neighborhoods, they say. </p>
<p>White members of Engine Company 60 on the South Side of Chicago see it differently. The mention of New Haven drew a cluster of firefighters who said they have seen examples of reverse discrimination and voiced concern that procedures used to increase diversity in the higher ranks may harm the public. </p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Officers </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the officers are outstanding, but the ones who trickle through the cracks aren&rsquo;t as well qualified as they should be,&#8221; said Captain Lee Basile, 47, a 27-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department. Asked whether the current system, which also allows supervisors to make &#8220;merit&#8221; promotions regardless of race or test scores, puts citizens&rsquo; safety at risk, Basile said, &#8220;absolutely.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Gary] Tinney [a black firefighter who didn&rsquo;t do well enough to qualify for a promotion] also works at the Dixwell firehouse. In an interview last week, the 44-year-old lieutenant said he is concerned about the lack of diversity in the officer ranks and doesn&rsquo;t see a chance for improvement any time soon. </p>
<p>&#8220;This particular lawsuit has set us back 45 years,&#8221; Tinney said. </p>
<p>Ricci, 35, and other firefighters argued that they had studied hard and wanted the test to count no matter how they did. Ricci described how his dyslexia required him to spend hundreds of dollars to pay someone to read the materials into a tape as he studied as many as 13 hours a day to prepare. </p>
<p><strong>No Second-Best</strong> </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t even know if I made it,&#8221; Ricci said, according to the meeting transcripts. &#8220;But the people who passed should be promoted. When your life&rsquo;s on the line, second-best may not be good enough.&#8221; Ricci isn&rsquo;t granting interviews now. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it INCREDIBLE, AMAZING,etc. that issues like the white firefighters don&rsquo;t move the European American public? Talk about the handwriting being on the wall. I mean, it is being written in BOLD LETTERING, and yet, whites are oblivious. Pat Buchanan, has been a voice in the wilderness on this issue. It&rsquo;s just anti-intuitive to think that Americans wouldn&rsquo;t be moved en masse by this stuff, so serious are the implications.</p>

<p>Just like the talent scouts for basketball &#8220;inflate&#8221; the performance of blacks over non-blacks, I presume.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Diversity and cultural experiences are important for first responders, Thompson said. &ldquo;You can embrace it and adapt or you can fight it and be a dinosaur,&rdquo; he said.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, nor have I ever been, a fireman but can someone point to the lecture, manual etc states that &#8220;differences in race, religion and culture&#8221; make it easier to put out fires and retrieve cats from trees?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Firefighters say diversity can be especially important in emergencies. Victims may feel more comfortable when they see first responders who look similar to them or understand their neighborhoods, they say. </i>&#8220;</p>
<p>1. I&rsquo;m sorry, but when did &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; = &#8220;diversity&#8221;?<br>
2. If my, or any of your, house(s) were on fire would you want:<br>
a. An officer in charge <i>because of his skills/merit</i>, or<br>
b. An officer in charge <i>because of the colour of his skin</i>?</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s important that first responders  &#8220;look like&#8221; the folks they are aiding, a racial concept valid for hiring latinos, but yet somehow not racist. Of course it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Remember the over-weight, black Chicago firefighter who had to be rescued while on a call?</p>
<p>As I always say, I happy to give blacks anything they want so long as they stay within their own communities. If it&rsquo;s important that blacks communities see black firefighters, let blacks run their own stations in their own neighborhoods. They can promote anyone for any reason, no tests, no prerequesists, minimal qualifications, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Incompetent blacks coast on the work and efforts of whites.</p>
<p>The fact is whites thrive without blacks but blacks can&rsquo;t live without whites.</p>

		<p>So once again this tired old claptrap is trotted-out about non-whites being more comfortable, in this case in emergencies, when seeing others who &#8220;look similar to them.&#8221; Yet Whites are supposed to embrace &#8220;Diversity&#8221; at every turn, and welcome all those who look distinctly UNLIKE themselves, as doing otherwise would be immoral and evil&hellip;or something to that effect. A three year old can see the obvious hypocrisy here - but &#8220;enlightened&#8221; elites evidently cannot!</p>

How &#8220;comfortable&#8221; is anyone going to be -how &#8220;comfortable&#8221; <i>should</i> anyone be- when his house is burning down?  Is a black homeowner going to dash back into the flames because he sees a &#8220;honky&#8221; trying to knock down his house fire?  Is a Hispanic going to tell a <i>guero</i> firefighter trying to give him oxygen after smoke inhalation: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with you doing that - call a <i>compadre</i> for me instead.&#8221;?<p>&#8220;Affirmative action&#8221; in hiring of firefighters is treating a critical civic service as a political football and will unconscionably endanger the lives of all races in any locality where it is adopted.</p></p></p>

<p>And here I thought all these years that people wanted firefighters to know about such things as structural integrity, the behavior of fires, and the ability to operate equipment.</p>
<p>A question from a St. Louis Fire Department promotional test (not an entrance test) that was considered &#8220;culturally biased&#8221; was this:  You are 90 feet away from the fire.  Each hose is 30 feet long.  How many hoses do you have to string together to reach the fire?  Evidently, 90 divided by 30 is culturally biased.  And this was a promotion test, so those at the Captain rank and above are straddled with such brain-busters.</p>

		<p>I hope the moderator doesn&rsquo;t mind if I just make a side comment on the &#8216;Dinosaur&rsquo; analogy, and leave the fireman issue alone.<br>
Socially and politically I am a proud Dinosaur, which feels weird to say as I am under 40yrs old.<br>
But when you think about it, though Dinosaurs are used as a example of something old and out-dated. They were actually a very successful species lasting for 200 million years.<br>
Where we&rsquo;ve been &#8216;self aware&rsquo; for what 40,000 years max. <br>
And how long would you give us from now?<br>
When it seems every faction on earth now has it&rsquo;s own nuclear weapons and when we are heading for a global population of seven billion people, from having only a billion people a hundred years ago. <br>
Whilst we displace oursleves with people who still practise a medieval religion or who have the breeding habits formed from living &#8216;in the wild&rsquo;.  <br>
Look at modern buildings for instances that are built from materials designed to last maybe a century, compared to the Colosseum whose concrete has lasted 2,000 years. Or how with all of our clever technology we still haven&rsquo;t come up with anyway of recording data that would outlast the chisled clay tablets from ancient Egypt.   <br>
According to one of the Mayan, Nostradamous, Book of Revelations doomsday prophecies. When the magnetic polarity of the Earth reverses all of the 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s of this electronic digital world that we&rsquo;re indulging now would be wiped.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not as clever as we think we are and we can never leave the old ways completely,<br>
It would take very little to throw our World into chaos, try a world pandemic or a 5 degree global drop in temperature to start the next Ice age.<br>
Then it would be the time of us dinosaurs again.</p>

		<p>This has always puzzled me, are these police and firefighter tests given in some kind of special code that Blacks don&rsquo;t know about? Are test results secret and then adjusted to place whites ahead of blacks? How else could you explain the consistent pattern of failure of blacks?  </p>
<p>I can understand blacks failing entry level tests, but when black police/firemen with 10-15 years experience, and black captains and lieutenants are failing job related tests at the sames rates as entry level test takers, I&rsquo;m thinking most of these blacks are in over their heads. </p>

<p>We can only wish.  Here&rsquo;s my bet:  The Republicans will be too afraid to even bring the issue up, lest they be labeled &#8220;racists&#8221;.  Besides, they have to hang on to their whopping 35% of the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>Of course there are other issues the Republicans could bring up, so it&rsquo;s hardly the only arrow in their quiver.  Among those rulings of Sotomayer that were appealed, 60% were overturned.  Even the left wing Mother Jones magazine had this to say about her writing, &#8220;Her opinion in the case runs 80 pages; reading it might be good punishment for law students who show up late for class.&#8221;  The simple fact is that on simple matters of competence she wouldn&rsquo;t even be considered if she wasn&rsquo;t a Hispanic woman.</p>

The operative word is may, as the speaker is speculating.  This has no basis-in-fact.  It is a highly doubtful statement when people are in deparate need of help.<br>
What is factual is in the home health care industry blacks prefer black aides, and Hispanics don&rsquo;t want black aides.  Just who is the bigoted ethnic group?</p>

<p>Well who hates Pat Buchanan?  Those are the people who don&rsquo;t a debate on AA.  The reason this issue hasn&rsquo;t become bigger is because the neocon dominated mainstream conservative media won&rsquo;t get behind it.  Think about how AA dropped off the political radar screen after Bush was elected.  We never heard anything about it for years.  Instead, we heard about how the Republicans need to reach out to minorities and about how we need to fight wars in the middle east that are not in America&rsquo;s interest.  If we want to know who is responsible for AA being ignored by the GOP, look which groups HAVE been pandered to:  big business, the fundamentalists and the neocons.  </p>

		<p>is it possible no one has noticed that the rationale for having firemen &#8220;look like people there serving&#8221; works against blacks and Hispanic firemen:</p>
<p>it means that whites people have the right to request that only white firemen service their neighborhoods, only white policeman patrol them, only white teachers teach in the schools, etc., which amounts to a justification for full-scale apartheid.</p>
<p>this confirms my suspicion that people who defend race quotas for protected minorities can&rsquo;t even hear what they&rsquo;re saying, they&rsquo;re just repeating slogans like robots.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a double standard mainstream whites love, because it makes whites a caste above in their own eyes. Whites love it when the firefighter, gardener, soldier, cook, auto tech, whatever is black or brown. It gives these whites a sense of superiority to see that. They love it and eat it up and caste aspersions on other whites who don&rsquo;t play along with the new Caste System America. That&rsquo;s the real motivation of these &#8220;liberals&#8221;: it hurts their aggrandized self image to see a white man working with his hands. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fatal flaw in whites. It&rsquo;s getting whites chopped up and burnt alive in South Africa, not without cause. Whites have no right to make themselves a caste above and expect to be waited on like princes and princesses. </p>

<p>Guess the only practical answer being that only WHITES are required to take tests. That Blacks and Mexicans should automatically be qualified on the basis of skin color alone.</p>
<p>That said, now WHO wants to be the first to entrust himself to an affirmative action Brain Surgeon or Open Heart Surgery Specialist? Do I hear any volunteers?<br>

		<p>In regards to this issue the left is not wholey behind the anti-white bigotry.  Even some of the posters at DailyKos concede that testing is not culturally biased or contributing to disparate impact.  I&rsquo;m quite sure they are seeing that they are becoming a joke which is the worst fear of anyone trying to promotes one&rsquo;s own authority as the liberals see themselves.</p>

		<p>I worked for department of corrections 10 years, then the state police until I retired last year.  I&rsquo;m here to tell you this&hellip;.over the years of my civil service (33 years) I&rsquo;ve seen nearly ALL civil service examinations and promotion tests &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; so blacks could have a chance at passing them.   You probably wonder why I make such a bold comment?   Because &#8220;I&#8221; was the one who dumbed-down the tests as per verbal orders from the commissioner and other high-ranking supervisors at the time.    It was a closed door meeting and bringing &#8220;DIVERSITY&#8221; (i.e. blacks) into the higher ranks was the main objective.   Even after making the tests 10th grade level and doing everything but coloring in the correct bubbles, the blacks still failed 60% of the time while &#8220;white&#8221; passing scores were always 100%?   Finally, all tests were done away with (2002) and promotions were based upon evaluation scores, physical fitness, range quals and other &#8220;physical&#8221; factors.   Sad but true and one day&hellip;before I leave this earth, I&rsquo;ll confess what I know to the national news agencies - along with many memorandums on how to &#8220;promote diversity&#8221;.    It&rsquo;s a joke. </p>

		<p>Hi, I was an Army recruiter from 1998 thru 08/2003 and one FACT I can comment on is the pre-ASVAB screening test which I administered on a weekly basis.  These tests were dummied down to a at least 8th grade level, a pre-high school SAT is what they reminded me of.   These tests were made simplier for one reason - so africian americans could pass them.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen young white people come into my office half drunk/high/stoned, etc, take the test and score mid-80&rsquo;s through 90.   Blacks on the other hand were always the last to finish, asked a million questions (cheated using calculators) during the exam and nearly 100% of them scored below 60%, some as low as 9 or 10.   That is a fact that can easily be confired by calling any armed forces recruiter&hellip;blacks score lower.   </p>

<p>As the percentage of white people in this country continues to decrease opposition to affirmative action, quota, busing, ad nauseam will steadily weaken.</p>
<p>A chilling prospect but one that is true.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s more than anti-White bigotry. It&rsquo;s a conscious desire to wipe out all the progress made by descendants of Europeans, to take their assets, and give them to the imagined victims of White &#8220;oppression.&#8221;<br>

		<p>At the rate we are going we will need affirmative action to ensure we are not discriminated against when we become the minority in 40 years.</p>
<p>Second ability over politics especially in that line of work should have never been a question this goes to show that our society is decaying. &#8220;A virtues society is a dying society&#8221; - who said that? (one of those Greek philosophers). </p>

<p>Actually, ASVAB test scores, averaging nearly 100, the highest scoring enlisted man I met had an ASVAB score of 135, roughly correlate to IQ. </p>

		<p>The goal is to make bigotry against white males permanent, forever.  Eventually they will just refuse to hire any white males at all.  Like where the Chicago Post Office is headed.</p>
