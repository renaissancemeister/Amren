<h1><a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090615/local/refugees-leave-for-the-us">Refugees Leave for the US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of Malta, June 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of 10 refugees from Somalia and Eritrea left Malta today to begin a new life in the United States. Since the U.S. Embassy began its permanent refugee resettlement programme in May 2008, over 260 refugees have been resettled to the U.S.</p>
<p>Jason Davis, Chargé d&rsquo;Affaires at the U.S. Embassy, said that the refugee resettlement programme showed the continuing commitment of the United States to help ease the burden that migration had placed on Malta, as well as its recognition of the enormous challenges and dangers that many of the migrants had faced.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Programme&rsquo;s success is a tribute to continued hard work on the part of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration, and the United States government, as well as many others here in Malta who have dedicated themselves to improving the lives of refugees in need of humanitarian assistance,&#8221; Mr Davis said.</p>
<p>He explained that refugees are assigned a sponsor agency in the U.S. that provides initial services such as housing, food, and clothing, as well as referral to medical care, employment services, and other support services during the transition period to self-sufficiency. These services are provided in order to facilitate refugees with the process of integration and cultural assimilation.<br>

		<p>There is a man, Norman lowell, A native of Malta that has written books, one of them &#8220;Credo&#8221; and created a movement called &#8220;Imperivm Evropa&#8221; His intention is the preservation of the &#8220;Europid&#8221; as he calls the Caucasians generated out of European soil. He is trying to create an empire based on race, culture and soil. It is obvious that there appears to be no end in sight to dark people from third world countries desiring refuge in first world countries created by whites. Why ? Why is it that dark people gravitate to white people for an endless barage of reasons? Am I wrong about this&hellip;or is this truth? Are there examples of high civil cultures generated by the darker peoples? Compassion is no doubt a quality of God fearing people but is there a balance possible&hellip;a solution that allows whites a cohesive racial,cultural,geographic identity? Must the white people forgo their existence as a living culture because of another race that cannot seem to sustain itself? Or is it true that white cultures eventually shy away from the more meneal labors and create a vacumn drawing in the third worlders? Mr. Lowells Imperivm is elitest in remembrence of the classical era and he also seems convinced of an enemy within type thing of international manipulators etc&hellip; I am skeptical of hard solutions in dealing with people in need however I&rsquo;m not interested in swapping karma with others that have historically squandered their dignity either. Does the white race owe its existence to others? What did Abel owe Cain?  </p>

		<p>In the tiny country of Malta, the illegal immigrant problem is writ large, since it is near to Africa but has little ability to absorb African immigrants. Common sense suggests that they should prevent African boat people from landing on their island with whatever force is necessary. Such a view is advocated by a Maltese with the unlikely Anglo name of Norman Lowell, who up to now has been regarded as a fringe person.</p>

		<p>Where is Anders Lago, mayor of that Swedish town who was praised by president &#8220;I&rsquo;ll-blameya&#8221; and bragged about how he took in more Iraqi refugees than the US?  Send them to him.  Give him and Sweden something else to brag about.</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re at it, they can ask the mayor of Lewiston, Maine about the joys of taking in African refugees. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll give them a piece of his mind to feed on. </p>

		<p>How nice that the 260 Africans shipped to the US have been offered &#8220;support services during the transition to self-suffiency&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alas, they will never become self-sufficient and will spend the rest of their lives on &#8220;support services&#8221; aka welfare.</p>

		<p>So, the Somalis will be arriving in the U.S., from Malta, which cannot absorb these &#8220;Refugees&#8221;. Interesting.</p>
<p>The Somalis will be given housing, food, clothing, medical care and referals to Employment Services, while they &#8220;facilitate the process of intergration and assimilation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sure. Who among the readers of this web site believes that? They are Incapabale of Assimilation. The Blacks that have been here for 400 years still can&rsquo;t get it togther. </p>
<p>And what &#8220;Emploment Services&#8221; is the Author of this article talking about? </p>
<p>Someone should tell this writer that we are in a Recession, and Companies are letting people go, not hiring them. </p>
<p>Also, just what are these Somalis qualified to do? I don&rsquo;t think that there is a big need for shrunken heads, outside the Voodoo crowd, so what could they do, to EARN MONEY?   </p>
<p>Malta also has to take a pro-active approach to this problem of Illegal Immigration from Africa. They need to use their Navy and Coast Guard to either turn the boats around, and send them back where they came from, or sink the boats. </p>
<p>The Maltese need to send a message that they will protect their Sovereign waters, and Country.</p>

		<p>Malta isn&rsquo;t suffering from the consequences of its own immigration policy, but of EU immigration policy. These African boat people started to invade Malta only after its entering EU. The African see it as the closest EU soil, where they can set their foot and they hope, that they will be moved from the refugee camps on Malta to other EU countries. And EU doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop these people - they just want to spread the Africans evenly into all countries, especially to those who were so far spared this particular kind of &#8220;diversity&#8221; - Eastern European countries. Too white, apparently&hellip;these new countries should show &#8220;solidarity&#8221; and accept these immigrants&hellip;</p>

		<p>While 260 might not sound like much over a single year, it&rsquo;s still 260 too many.</p>
<p>The Maltese should take what that one Northern League italian politician had to say literally, and start shelling any refugee boat they see.</p>

		<p>Definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over yet expecting different results.  As long as we keep rewarding these countries by &#8220;absorbing&#8221; their problems, there is absolutely zero incentive to correct it.  Of course, our gov&rsquo;t leadership is clearly insane.</p>

		<p>This is the equivalent of hitting the lottery for a resident of the third world, and will no doubt serve as an incentive for fellow third worlders.</p>
<p>Looking on the bright side, I&rsquo;m sure these refugees will help boost our flagging economy.  The Horn of Africa did not get where it is today without the brains, innovation and work ethic of these latest arrivals to America&rsquo;s shores.  </p>

		<p>Interesting that Malta was once a European fortress against Turkish invasion, and that during World War II it was a British base that held despite a fullscale Axis aerial assault. Today? It capitulates in the face of the hordes swarming up from Africa. Of course, this is part of the general Western paralysis generated by liberalism. </p>
<p>As for the USA absorbing Somalis  &mdash;  if we are to bring in African immigrants, how about White Rhodesians and South Africans who want to emigrate from the nightmare of black-run countries? </p>

		<p>  Malta served as Great Britain&rsquo;s Mediterranean base/land aircraft carrier during World War II. If the Germans or Italians had taken Malta, the Axis would have probably won North Africa. The Maltese were bombed and blockaded during the conflict. Today, Malta serves as another kind of a base, a base for multiculturalism. &#8220;Refugees&rdquo; from Muslim Africa come for settlement in previously all Christian and white Malta. Why are whites the only ones expected to &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; such diversity?</p>

		<p>I knew plenty of Maltese when I was living in Australia.  A decade ago, there were already more Maltese in Australia than there were in Malta.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not bad folks; they&rsquo;re juat like Italians.</p>
