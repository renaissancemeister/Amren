<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15babies.html">U.S. Births Hint at Bias for Boys in Some Asians</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The trend is buried deep in United States census data: seemingly minute deviations in the proportion of boys and girls born to Americans of Chinese, Indian and Korean descent.</p>
<p>In those families, if the first child was a girl, it was more likely that a second child would be a boy, according to recent studies of census data. If the first two children were girls, it was even more likely that a third child would be male.</p>
<p>Demographers say the statistical deviation among Asian-American families is significant, and they believe it reflects not only a preference for male children, but a growing tendency for these families to embrace sex-selection techniques, like in vitro fertilization and sperm sorting, or abortion.</p>

		<p>Sex selection has become a huge business in India, extending out of the infanticide of girl babies traditionally practiced.</p>
<p>Not long ago there was reports of a well in India that was full of the disposed remains of female babies.  Thanks to Western science, families who don&rsquo;t want to raise girls no longer have to go that route.  </p>
<p>Ultra-sound is advertised as, &#8220;spend 500 rupees now, or 500,000 later&#8221;, meaning spend 500 on sex selection, so a female fetus can be aborted, or end up spending 500,000 later on her dowry.  Indian families see good financial planning in not having girls.</p>

		<p>We must keep quiet about this. In about 60 years we will see the effect of this policy, the asian population will decline. If the whites keep adding people, we will have a larger population and dominate asia. I won&rsquo;t be around, but this is a gift for our grandchildren.<br>
   My fear is that they will wake up.</p>

		<p>Very true. Having worked with many East Asians, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m pretty certain they don&rsquo;t do abortions. They&rsquo;re extremely conservative in their beliefs (also homophobic too). I&rsquo;ve heard of South Asian women killing newborn girls and Chinese farmers adopting out girls, but its probably non-existent in the more educated immigrant populations in the West. <br>
But, I know some East Asians (straight from China), who have opted to participate in sex selection. Asians who were born here, but had parents born in Asia, tell me they&rsquo;re under pressure from their parents to marry another Asian, and to produce grandchildren (preferably male). Believe me there is NOTHING more satisfying to a Chinese immigrant than caring for a newborn grandchild (Asian neighbour of ours moved near their son for that purpose). Their desires sometimes force their children to use IVF to make their parents wish come true. It means that 3rd generation Asians (of which I a few), become very left wing, due to the paranoia their parents developed about their parents right wing anti-communist agenda. Which means that as time goes on, Asians will inevitably become more and more aligned to the idea of Affirmative action; even though, like whites, it places them at a disadvantage, allowing people of lesser talents to succeed.</p>

		<p>This is old news. Anyone who knows about asian cultures knows that almost all asian cultures prefer to have sons over daughters.</p>

		<p>This preference for male offspring is not unique to Asians.  It&rsquo;s seen among white yuppies, who put off children until well estabished in their careers, then opt for one &#8220;designer&#8221; child in their late Thirties.  If the hapless fetus is female, they sometimes opt to abort it and try for another. This is not only profoundly sick, it&rsquo;s going to result in a shortage of marriable females in the future.</p>

<p>As someone once wrote: &#8220;The times, they are a&rsquo;changing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Decades of female infanticide (thanks to prenatal testing and abortion) have taken their toll in the Far East, and the peoples there are beginning to wake up to that fact.  The colossal gender imbalance in China (the largest in the world) has triggered a demographic nightmare in that country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html?ex=1356066000&amp;en=7f1d398ba65c510a&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html?ex=1356066000&en;=7f1d398ba65c510a&ei;=5124&partner;=permalink&exprod;=permalink</a></p>
<p>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-08/02/content_654945.htm</p>
<p>In a fitting irony, Chinese females (at least the affluent, urban-dwelling ones) seem to be getting the last laugh.  These girls are parlaying their relative scarcity into increased freedoms and privileges their mothers and grandmothers would never have enjoyed.</p>

		<p>I wonder how these parents will feel when these surplus boys can&rsquo;t find mates when they grow up.  Given the interracial dating disparity between Asian men and Asian women, this is a real possibility.</p>

		<p>Indian men living in the West have eyes for white women. Light skin is considered very desirable and associated with status in Indian culture.  To them, having a white woman is like having a movie star.</p>
<p>The conquest of Western women, by their &#8216;surplus&rsquo; males, goes hand in hand with the conquest of the feminized liberal West by patriarchal Asia.</p>
