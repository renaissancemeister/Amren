<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/28/AR2009052803746.html">Md. License Confusion for Illegal Residents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Rein and Nick Miroff, Washington Post, May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of illegal immigrants in Maryland have been scrambling in recent weeks in last-ditch attempts to get driver&rsquo;s licenses before a law curtailing their privileges takes effect Monday. But for many, the effort will have been a waste of time, caused by confusion and conflicting interpretations over how the new rules work.</p>
<p>When the window shuts at the close of business today, they will discover that learner&rsquo;s permits and state-issued identification cards they obtained can&rsquo;t be converted to licenses, as they thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no question there&rsquo;s mass confusion,&#8221; said Kim Propeack of CASA of Maryland, the state&rsquo;s largest immigrant advocacy group.</p>
<p>For years, Maryland allowed undocumented immigrants to drive, but the system made the state vulnerable to fraud by out-of-state motorists. After rancorous debate, state legislators this year changed the rules to comply with the federal security law known as Real ID. As of Monday, license applicants will have to prove that they are in the country legally. Illegal immigrants already carrying licenses can keep them until 2015, after one renewal.</p>
<p>Because of late-night changes to the bill on the final day of the legislative session, learner&rsquo;s permits and identification cards issued to illegal immigrants after April 19 can&rsquo;t be converted into full licenses, and licenses issued to them after that date can&rsquo;t be renewed. But under a ruling by motor vehicle officials Wednesday, thousands who obtained ID cards before April 19 will be able to use them to get licenses, a provision some lawmakers call an unforeseen loophole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, immigrants have been crowding into motor vehicle agency offices and calling lawmakers and advocates for help. Spurred by advertisements on Spanish language television and radio, thousands spent the past six weeks trying to secure licenses.</p>
<p>Some were likely the victims of scam artists, telling The Washington Post they paid hundreds of dollars or more to agencies promising to arrange appointments. Others traveled far from their homes to various motor vehicle branches scattered across the state, hoping to land walk-in appointments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, the fate of identification cards issued before April 19 finally was decided: They can be converted to licenses after Monday, MVA Administrator John T. Kuo said.</p>
<p>This, like so many other details of the new law, has surprised and disappointed some lawmakers.</p>

		<p>If this were a sane country, all of the beurocrats allowing this would be arrested and jailed. The are in total violation of U.S. Immigration Law, Title 8 Section 1325 of the U.S. immigration law code. It is unlawfull to harbor, facilitate, or in anyway enable the stay of a foreign national illegal in the country,etc.</p>

<p>Well, then they&rsquo;ll just have to come down to Florida and get their licenses.  Here they&rsquo;ll give illegals a license if they have a Micky Mouse Mexican I.D. card that can be bought in Mexico or on the street in any big city in the Southwest, but citizens have to have a US birth certificate, a SS Card, plus two other forms of identification for back up, just to get their licenses renewed. </p>
<p>We may as well be tattoed with a concentration camp number on our forearms or have an electronic chip surgically inserted beneath our skin.</p>
<p>The longer I live here the more I grow to despise the government and wish it all the ill I can muster.  I hope this entire zoo collapses.  </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t been here lately, but the woman who told me about this site asked me whether I still read it.  I picked a good day to look at it I guess because just like Sam D. I have strong opinions about &#8220;the government&#8221; using national security as an excuse to snoop on U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>This is really aimed at white people anyway because anybody else will scream that they are victims of racial profiling.  I guarantee you that who is involved in Amren is more interesting to the Feds than which terrorists are sneaking into this country because they don&rsquo;t want to be the villians to touchy ethnic groups.  Privacy issues are very, very much white people&rsquo;s issues so I think that fighting these government data bases on everybody is an important cause for us.     </p>
