<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20090614/INTERNATIONAL-US-ITALY-PATROLS/">Italy Backs Citizens Patrols, Despite Fascist Past</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antonella Cinelli and Roberto Bonzio, Reuters, June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s government, elected last year on a promise to crack down on crime and curb illegal immigration, has agreed with its Northern League allies a plan for [citizen] patrols to help police and soldiers on the streets.</p>
<p>The proposal, which still needs parliamentary approval, is opposed by Italy&rsquo;s left-wing opposition and by civil rights groups, who fear it could lead to racial discrimination and violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One volunteer group, the Italian National Guard, unveiled its proposal to participate in the patrols in Milan on Saturday, sporting beige uniforms and black military-style hats.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said that a prosecutor had opened an investigation into the group, which has links to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) formed by former Mussolini supporters.</p>
<p>The sources said the prosecutor could present charges in the coming days of attempting to resurrect the fascist party.<br/>

<p> These Reds and &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; groups, have no problem with nonwhite violence against Italians such as: rape, murder, and riot; the fact of the matter is, they derive a twisted sense of gratification from such horrors and make every excuse they can to justify them!</p>
<p>Thus, it is only right and proper to bring back the big strong legionnaires and turn them loose on all of the above: alien invaders, traitors, and especially the Reds. They all have it coming to them and then some!!!</p>

		<p>Citizen&rsquo;s patrols in Italy, why not? If the Nationalists (who form the government) don&rsquo;t do it first, then the Red extremists  certainly will &amp; use force to flood Italy with even more illegal immigrants. Staying silent &amp; playing catch-up in the face of the neo-Marxist totalitarians is not an option in a world controlled by this pro-EU political elite. Just look at the accompanying article where the neo-Marxist Lib/Lab/Con extremists in the UK are trying to create a law that will ban the perfectly legal BNP who have fairly &amp; squarely won seats in the European parliament. Serves them right. Just what kind of society do they think we&rsquo;re living in? A democracy? These neo-Marxists believe in freedom of speech all right, so long as you agree with what THEY say. </p>

		<p>Citizens patrols? I&rsquo;m for it. We do have the remarkable Curtis Sliwa&rsquo;s Guardian Angels, who operate throughout the nation. But even they have been hasseled by inane liberals as somehow bothering citizens. No surprise. Aside from the Guardian Angels, the only citizens watch groups we have in my area involves something called the &#8220;neighborhood watch,&#8221; this is where citizens spy on each other and then gossip about what they have seen. Not one of my neighbors saw who broke into my car and stole my CD player, but they sure see everything else that I do. Citizens patrols? Hell, I&rsquo;m all for them, here in Southern California, or as some people say, occupied California. In Los Angeles, police chief Bratton has basically made the L.A.P.D. useless in guarding the citizenry, so we sure could use another method.</p>

		<p>This article is typical leftist MSM disinformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judicial sources said that a prosecutor had opened an investigation into the group, which has links to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) formed by former Mussolini supporters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Italian Social Movement was officially dissolved at its 1995 party congress where it was incorporated into National Alliance, a Conservative party.  The more hardline members (like Alessandra Mussolni) left to form their own splinter groups.</p>
<p>http://tripatlas.com/Movimento_Sociale_Italiano</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;The sources said the prosecutor could present charges in the coming days of attempting to resurrect the fascist party.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Italian Fascist party was resurrected almost 20 years ago.  It just never went anywhere.</p>

		<p>Citizen Patrols in Italy. Fabulous. It does seem like many of our European Brothers are taking things a bit more seriously than we are here, in the U.S.</p>
<p>As &#8220;Bobby&#8221; mentioned above, the Guardian Angels were formed over 30 years ago, in response to the out-of-control crime wave that took hold of New York City.</p>
<p>I rememeber when Curtis Sliwa had formed the group, to basically ride the Subways, and keep Criminal Opportunits from attacking a would-be victim, while riding the trains. </p>
<p>I had seen them many times, when I was on the Subway, as well. </p>
<p>I am a member of the Auxiliary Police, and we are supplied with Uniforms by the Police Department. We patrol our Neighborhoods on foot, or by Patrol Car. </p>
<p>Actually, the only other Citizen&rsquo;s Group that is comperable to the Italian National Guard, would be the Minutemen Project. </p>
<p>The Minutemen donate their time on our Southern Border, and reports the movements of Illegal Aliens passing through our border, to the U.S. Border Patrol. </p>
<p>I think that it is about time that we Deputize the Minutemen, through the U.S. Marshals Service, or Immigration Service, and let them make Citizen&rsquo;s arrests of Illegal Aliens, in their State. </p>

		<p>Now you know why Silvio Berlusconi is the subject of daily scurrilous attacks (orchestrated by an odd alliance of the British gutter press and the hard Italian left).<br/>
 - Although scurrilous in the extreme all these dirty little attacks happen to be untrue.</p>

		<p>Anything the indigenous people of Europe do to reasonably organize themselves to protect themselves from the rapacious crime of illegal immigrants will called &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;fascist&#8221;. This name calling, calculated to bother the moronic conscience of liberal sap-hearted whites, should be completely ignored.</p>

<p>Siily boy!  That&rsquo;s just legitimate expression of their cultural imperatives&hellip;like drinking and driving is to Illegos.  White people &#8220;have no culture.&#8221;</p>
