<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31048825/">Political Motive Cited in Military Office Shooting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man with &#8220;political and religious motives&#8221; killed a soldier just out of basic training and wounded another Monday in a targeted attack on a military recruiting center, police said. The shootings were not believed to be part of a broader scheme.</p>
<p>A police report based on an interview with the suspect says Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, 23, told police he observed two soldiers in uniform, drove up to the recruiting center and started shooting.</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw them standing there and drove up and shot them,&#8221; Lt. Terry Hastings told The Associated Press. &#8220;That&rsquo;s what he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two soldiers who were shot had completed basic training within the past two weeks and were not regular recruiters, said Lt. Col. Thomas F. Artis of the Oklahoma City Recruiting Battalion, which oversees the Little Rock office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Police: He acted alone</b></p>
<p>Muhammad had converted to Islam at some point in his life and interviews with police show he &#8220;probably had political and religious motives for the attack,&#8221; the police chief said.</p>
<p>Muhammad, previously known as Carlos Bledsoe, was not part of a larger group nor was his attack part of a larger conspiracy, Thomas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas said Muhammad would be charged with first-degree murder, plus 15 counts of committing a terroristic act. Thomas said those counts result from the gunfire occurring near other people.</p>

		<p>  In some states there is a death category called Death Thru<br>
 Misadventure.It is mostly used to describe deaths caused by<br>
 dummy attacks such as tourists trying to pet Yellowstone<br>
 grizzly bears and other such foolishness.</p>
<p>  I propose a new category called death by diversity.It would<br>
 describe the deaths of Whites at the hands of muslims,blacks,<br>
 illegal aliens,etc.<br>
                                                                   It could be the wake up call that our people need.</p>

		<p>For Political and Religious reasons?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what other reason the MSM would give before mentioning Race.</p>
<p>The stars were aligned except for Venus wasn&rsquo;t exactly in conjunction with Mars.</p>
<p>The victims were terrible dressers and the shooter has an unusually acute fashion sense.</p>
<p>They greeted him with a friendly smile and that set him off.</p>
<p>His underwear was too tight.</p>
<p>He had a headache.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like Monday&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>ANYTHING but Race.</p>

		<p>Reading between the lines, I&rsquo;m guessing a prison convert.  The FBI had him on their watch list, why did they let him come back into the country from Yemen, which he did just a short while ago?</p>
<p>I also think that AQ thought he would do a lot more damage than he actually did.  That&rsquo;s what you get when you depend on the most impatient, impetulent and impulsive race/gender/age combo on Earth.</p>

		<p>how many muslims must show they are a fifth column before the MSM decides that this is newsworthy? we&rsquo;ve had the holyland foundation trial (during which the FBI uncovered that many muslims groups here in america have ties to the muslim brotherhood), somalis living in minneapolis going to fight for the jihadist groups in somalia, radical black muslims setting up compounds around the country, and most recently the four guys who converted to islam in prison and then plotted to blow up synagogues and kill american soldiers. and yet the media would rather focus on the shooting of a doctor who did abortions in kansas and thereby condemn all christians. nearly 3,000 people died on 9/11 and still the media refuses to shine a much needed harsh light on islam.</p>

<p>The black killed the white soldier simply because he was white, and the vast, vast majority of blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less, because the dead soldier is white.</p>
<p>Blacks care nothing for country or countrymen, unless they&rsquo;re black.  Race trumps everything with most all blacks.  They&rsquo;re the racist bunch of criminals in the world today.</p>

		<p>Unreconstructed.  I&rsquo;ve seen your comment re a &#8220;wake up call&#8221;<br>
for Whites time and time again&hellip;it won&rsquo;t happen! It is hopeless<br>
for Whites. Witness the recent matter where some White lady<br>
staged a kidnapping claiming black perps. When the hoax was<br>
realized one of the first statements on the TV news was the<br>
false blaming of blacks. Black organizations where outraged, etc.<br>
Here is a murder and this story will disappear as fast as it<br>
happened without any mention of the race angle. Whites deserve<br>
what is in store for the future.</p>

<p>What irritates me most is the hypocrisy with those same blacks. They want equality, yet they will do to whites what they accuse us of doing. Hypocrites.  Yeah, Wanda Sykes, to quote you, &#8220;I said that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Besides the usual proof that democracy doesn&rsquo;t work in a homogenous society, this story presents an alarming development that I have not seen yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas said Muhammad would be charged with first-degree murder, plus 15 counts of committing a terroristic act. Thomas said those counts result from the gunfire occurring near other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, does this mean if I am attacked and defend myself legally with my legal firearm that is carried legally and I shoot the attacker, I can be charged with a &#8220;terroristic act?&#8221;</p>

<p>If the race angle even comes up (which is unlikely), it will be dismissed as just a fluke that the victims were white. Purest coincidence. Nothing to do with race at all. It&rsquo;s outrageous even to suggest it.  How dare you!</p>
<p>Needless to say, as we all know, if the races were reversed, the whole country, and the world,  would be reading about another crazed racist white murderer on a hate-filled rampage.  And there would be the required candlelight marches, sermons, editorials, denunciations of &#8220;white supremecists&#8221;, demands for stricter hate crimes,  calls for &#8220;healing&#8221;,  and the politicians &#8220;hearts going out&#8221; for the victims families.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and also the self-flaggelating whites wallowing in guilt and begging forgiveness. And the black race-hustlers demanding reparations and ever more concessions.</p>

		<p>This case has gotten very little attention in the national media, but the Tiller murder is all over the place.  Reason: the liberal press can&rsquo;t blame the solider&rsquo;s killing on the &#8220;right wing,&#8221; but they will blame Tiller&rsquo; death on the &#8220;right wing&#8221; even before it is established that his killer is a pro-lifer.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to play Devil&rsquo;s Advocate here, and say that the two soldiers were shot, not because they were white, but becaue they were in uniform.  Remember, this kook had converted to Islam and had just returned from a Madrassa in Yemen.  One can only imagine what he was told about American soldiers over there.</p>
<p>My only question about this incident is where a 23 year-old comes up with the airfare for a trip to Yemen.  I know radical Muslim organizations already produce material that is distributed for free in US prisons - I even saw some of it while I was locked up.  Are they now paying to fly US (I won&rsquo;t call this perp an &#8220;American&#8221; converts overseas for further radicalization?</p>
<p>As an aside, the Arabic name &#8220;Abdulhakim&#8221; he picked literally means &#8220;Slave of the Doctor&#8221;; &#8220;abd al&#8221; means &#8220;slave of&#8221;.</p>
